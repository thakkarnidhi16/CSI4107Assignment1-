   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis held a
strong lead over Jesse Jackson as Washington state party officials
released results Tuesday from last week's Democratic presidential
precinct caucuses.
   With about 68 percent of the precincts reporting the results of
last Tuesday's balloting, Dukakis had 45 percent, Jackson 35
percent, and 14 percent were uncommitted.
   All the other candidates were well off the pace, with Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon a weak fourth at 4 percent, Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. 2 percent and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 1 percent.
   The Democratic Party made no effort to collect results statewide
on caucus night, gathering precinct returns slowly by mail instead.
   Republicans say it will be at least another week before county
chairmen submit the names of GOP delegates elected in last week's
precinct caucuses.
   The National Election Service reported last week that, with 71
percent of the Republican precincts reporting, former television
evangelist Pat Robertson led with 39 percent. Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas finished second with 26 percent and Vice President George
Bush got 24 percent.

   A 24-year-old man has pleaded guilty to
involuntary manslaughter in the death of his two children, who died
last summer hours after he locked them inside his car.
   John Shields of White Township entered the plea Monday, and
faces a maximum 10-year prison term and $20,000 fine.
   Judge Francis Searer deferred sentencing pending an
investigation by probation officials.
   Shields testified at his wife's trial two weeks ago that he
agreed to watch their children, Kristle, 3, and Calvin, 1, on the
morning of Aug. 22, but instead locked them in the car and closed
the windows.
   The children were discovered in the afternoon, when the
temperature reached the mid-80s, authorities said.
   Lisa Shields pleaded guilty to reduced charges and also is
awaiting sentencing.
   Both parents were charged with two counts of involuntary
manslaughter and endangering the welfare of children. The more
severe counts against Mrs. Shields were dropped.
   The two endangerment counts were incorporated in Shields' guilty
plea, court officials said.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' was moviegoers'
favorite for the the ninth-straight weekend, tying it with
``Crocodile Dundee'' for the longest consecutive time at the top.
   Second in last weekend's box office survey was ``Vice Versa,''
featuring a Judge Reinhold transformation into a prepubescent kid,
followed by ``Masquerade'' in third and ``Off Limits'' fourth.
   All 10 top grossing films combined took in about $30 million,
with ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' ringing up a mere $4.36 million
during the pre-Easter vacation box office doldrums.
   ``It's another down week,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor
Relations Co., which surveys the studios' weekly performance at the
box office. ``It looks like we're marking time until Easter.''
   For the Easter break, the studios are releasing the animated
feature ``The Fox and the Hounds,'' Alan Alda's ``A New Life,''
Matthew Broderick's ``Biloxi Blues'' and Anthony Michael Hall's
``Johnny B. Goode.''
   In addition to ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' the Disney Studios had
two other pictures in the top 10. ``Three Men and a Baby'' was
seventh 7 after 15 weeks in release and ``Shoot to Kill'' ninth.
   The lure of romance between Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly gave
``Masquerade'' a debut weekend gross of $3.5 million while the
Willem Dafoe-Gregory Hines cop thriller ``Off Limits'' earned $2.8
million.
   In fifth was Cher's critically-acclaimed ``Moonstruck,'' which
won her a Golden Globe trophy and an Oscar nomination, followed by
Harrison Ford's ``Frantic'' in sixth and ``Three Men and a Baby''
in seventh.
   ``Moving,'' starring Richard Pryor as a New York engineer forced
to relocate his family to Boise, Idaho, earned more than $2.4
million to place eighth, followed by ``Shoot to Kill.''
   In 10th place was ``Switching Channels,'' a broadcast version of
the venerable newsroom comedy ``The Front Page.'' It earned $1.9
million in its second week.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release and estimated production costs.
   1. ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Disney-Touchstone, $4.36 million,
1,579 screens, $2,767 per screen, $91.5 million, 11 weeks, $21
million.

<TEXT>
   What Shim Min-sop is doing now
conceivably could have landed him in jail not so long ago. He's
drawing cartoons that poke gentle fun at South Korean political
leaders.
   And people are getting a laugh out of them, without worrying
that something could happen to them as well.
   Shim's cartoons seem tame by most standards. Politicians and
political parties are parodied as rival baseball teams and the
jibes are never too strong. Nevertheless, Shim says, it is a
remarkable change.
   ``In the past it was a taboo to caricature the big political
names in this country,'' he said.
   Ridiculing the president or making jokes about him, for example,
were seen as anti-state acts.
   Shim and other cartoonists have been able to take advantage of
recent political liberalization in South Korea to start injecting a
little laughter and ridicule into politics.
   The cartoonists contend that political caricature is healthy and
Korean politics can benefit from it.
   ``Cartoons and caricatures will bring the political leaders
closer to the people,'' Shim maintained.
   Political cartoons have proliferated in newspapers and magazines
and command large, enthusiastic audiences eager for a regular flow
of material ranging from traditional editorial cartoons to long
stories. Literacy is very high in South Korea but people prize
cartoons for their humor.
   Newspaper cartoons so far are low-key and ironic. Some recent
ones showed caricatures of the main political parties chasing each
other in an unending circle, to symbolize ineffectiveness. Another
showed top leaders as squabbling babies.
   A favorite of cartoonists is to have bemused Koreans staring at
politicians battling for power and asking what is happening to the
country.
   ``It is refreshing to see the taboos broken about the myths
surrounding the political bigwigs,'' said Han Kye-su, a political
analyst who has followed the growth of political cartooning.
   Many cartoonists say they have always seen their work as a way
of calling for reform and liberalization.
   ``Korean cartoonists have been struggling for political change
for a long time,'' Shim said.
   Cartoons are a valuable teaching tool that can vividly explain
the meaning of an issue as well as amuse readers, Shim added.
   ``The political cartoonist can present the issues in a more
amusing, but understandable manner to the public.''
   The newly installed President Roh Tae-woo, who pledged freedom
of speech and expression after years of authoritarian rule,
personally encouraged cartoonists to take up political subjects by
saying he did not mind being caricatured.
   Shim and other cartoonists say their work is still very gentle
and restrained for fear of angering authorities and losing what
freedom they have. But they say they expect to make their humor
more biting as time goes on and liberalization expands.
   Cartoonists are also restrained by fear of offending a
politician's supporters, Shim said. Korea's factional politics
stress loyalty and supporters tend to resent any joke at their
leader's expense, he said.
   ``The reaction can be terrible from the supporters,'' Shim said.
``People should learn to accept both positive and negative.''
   Anti-government students and dissident groups, which have long
used cartoons in their political literature, also are making
greater use of caricatures, but usually not in a humorous way.
   The cartoons distributed at anti-government rallies and meetings
are biting and bitter. Government and mainline opposition
politicians are depicted as vicious tyrants suppressing the people
with tear gas and clubs. Some are more subtle, depicting the
divided opposition leaders as crying infants quarreling over a toy.
   ``They are not jokes,'' said one dissident. ``They show the
people the reality of the government and why there is no democracy
in South Korea.''
   Anti-government cartoons are distributed in pamphlets on college
campuses or posted on trees and sidewalks at anti-government
rallies.
   The United States, represented by a fiendish-looking Uncle Sam
or a swaggering and bullying American soldier, is a fixture in the
underground cartoons. Dissidents claim the country's successive
authoritarian governments have survived because of U.S. backing.
   One recent cartoon showed a tough-looking Statue of Liberty with
a boxing glove on her upraised hand.
   Shim and other cartoonists reject their underground competition
and the radical politics behind it. They say change must be
moderate.
   ``It's too early to expose politicians to a more revealing
fashion,'' Shim said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayoral elections in Colombia have left
a small crack in the political fortress of the upper class, the
power behind this Latin American country since it won independence
from Spain in 1819.
   The elections on Sunday marked the first time that mayors had
been elected in Colombia. Previously, they were appointed by
governors, who were appointed by the president.
   And the president always came from the Liberal or the
Conservative parties that are manipulated by the rich.
   But a leftist coalition, the Patriotic Union party, won at least
14 of l,008 mayoral posts in Sunday's election, which in some cases
brought people from the poorer classes closer to the seat of power
in local politics.
   The money and power of the traditional parties ruled out in most
cases, such as in Bogota where Andres Pastrana, the son of former
president Misael Pastrana, was elected mayor on the Conservative
ticket.
   The Liberal Party of President Virgilio Barco won 430 of the
mayoral races, and the Conservative party won 402 mayoral posts.
Coalition candidates won 24 of the mayoral elections.
   Other results may not be known for a week because of the
remoteness of many towns.
   The showing by the new Patriotic Union was small. But the
results were surprising given that the party was organized just
three years ago.
   The leftist coalition also had to survive a wave of
assassinations by right-wing death squads that killed 520 of the
members of the party, including its president, Jaime Pardo.
   The Patriotic Union also had to confront a colonial attitude of
patronage.
   Entire towns and areas traditionally adhere to one of the two
traditional parties. Until recently, people did not join political
parties. They were born into them.
   It is common knowledge that failure of a peasant to support the
party controlling an area means virtual economic suicide. A loan
application at the local bank for buying seed will be rejected. A
worker will be turned away when looking for a job at a big hacienda.
   Colombians still call the rich La Rosca, a kind of intertwined
pastry. The term refers to a loose intertwining of influential
people _ politicians, businessmen, landowners, doctors and lawyers
_ who control the lives of the poor.
   Nowhere are the poor more aware of La Rosca than in small towns,
where the wealthy own most of the rural land.
   A 1970 government study showed that 4.3 percent of the people in
Colombia owned 68 percent of the land. Ten percent of the farms
held 80 percent of total farmland. Those figures probably have not
changed much.
   The government's concession to hold mayoral elections is an
indication that Colombia may be heading toward true democracy.
   The country has a long history of violence, perpetuated largely
by a political elite that refused to reform partisan traditions.
   For example, elements of the Liberal party resisted social
changes in 1948. A charasmatic Liberal leader, Jorge Elicer Gaitan,
broke away from the party and ran as an independent. Gaitan was
assassinated shortly afterward.
   People saw their only hope of bettering their lives cut down,
and the frustration exploded into the worst disturbances ever seen
in Colombia.
   That period, known simply as The Violence, has had an impact
upon Colombian politics ever since.
   So when former president Belisario Betancur offered peace talks
to the country's leftist guerrillas in 1984, most people approved.
Perhaps they recognized that the need for social changes were again
putting pressure on the system.
   The guerrillas said in 1985 they wanted a government more
responsive to the poor people. For starters, they said they wanted
the election of mayors.
   Betancur agreed, and the congress approved a constitutional
amendement to allow the first election in 1988.
   The peace talks collapsed last year, but the government went
ahead with the elections.
   The army says there are about 5,000 leftist guerrillas in
Colombia. The rebels claim they have close to 20,000 combatants.
Whatever the number, their forces are growing each year.
   Ten years ago the army said there were only about 2,500
guerrillas.
   The growth of guerrilla forces and the possibility of another
upheaval probably will depend greatly on whether the wealthy will
concede to such programs as land reform, housing programs and
building more schools and hospitals in rural areas.
   The government's attitude toward social change continues to be
cautious. The election of mayors is a beginning, but not a solution.

<DATELINE>WOONSOCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet dissident whose pleas for an
exit visa were ignored until he stepped up his reporting of human
rights abuses has found a new home in the West.
   Theodore Kizelov, 43, arrived in Rhode Island last Tuesday after
a journey that led from Sverdlovsk, a town in the Ural Mountains,
through Vienna and Rome to the United States.
   The Tolstoy Foundation, an international, non-profit
organization that helps resettle political refugees, found him an
apartment and gave him enough money to live on for a month, said
Maureen Dalpe of the Woonsocket chapter.
   Kizelov, who had never been outside the Soviet Union before his
expulsion, learned English by listening to British radio broadcasts
and should have little trouble finding a job, Ms. Dalpe said.
   ``I will start with any job available,'' said Kizelov, ``even
washing dishes in a restaurant.''
   Kizelov had been a dissident since the late 1970s, when he wrote
what he calls his first ``open letter'' opposing the government _ a
statement against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He sent the
letter to the Moscow Monitor and Helsinki Group, which published it
outside the Soviet Union.
   ``I didn't begin to hide until 1983,'' Kizelov said, because in
general, it is safe to risk criticizing the Soviet government
without reprisals for three years or so.
   But the KGB patrols that began following him that year did not
deter him.
   To make himself a difficult target, Kizelov began moving from
city to city. He held odd jobs, and friends helped with money.
Meanwhile, he continued to gather information about Soviet human
rights violations, sending the information to groups interested in
publishing it.
   Last fall, Kizelov found himself working as a theater decorator
in Sverdlovsk, a town whose former political boss, Boris Yeltsin,
had been promoted to serve as the Communist Party's first secretary
of Moscow.
   Yeltsin was drummed out of office by party officials last
November after delivering a speech that reportedly rankled powerful
officials in the Communist Party, including General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Officials in Sverdlovsk, however, took a dim view of one of
their favorite sons being kicked out of office, and began
demonstrating in public. Kizelov wrote about it.
   He sent his 3,000-word report on the demonstrations and a cover
letter to Sergei Grigoryants, editor of a Moscow-based underground
magazine called Glasnost. The sporadically-published magazine takes
its cue from Gorbachev's policy of ``openness'' in public affairs.
   But Grigoryants never received the report. Kizelov assumes it
was intercepted by Soviet police. A short while after sending it,
he received an ``invitation'' to report to the emigration office to
talk about his desire to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``They say nothing until I was involved in the demonstrations,''
said Kizelov.
   While Americans seem to be cautiously optimistic about the
policy of glasnost, Kizelov calls it a ``mask.'' He says Soviet
society is intolerant of anything but the official line and there
is no such thing as freedom of speech.
   ``I don't like the socialist way of life in principle,'' said
Kizelov. ``In my opinion, it is the wrong way of development.''

<TEXT>
   A funeral procession bearing
the bodies of three IRA guerrillas slain in Gibraltar was met by
thousands of people when it arrived early Tuesday under heavy rain
at Roman Catholic west Belfast.
   Jeering Protestants waving British flags had hurled stones and
bottles at the cortege in Northern Ireland as it made its way by
road to Belfast from Dublin in the Irish Rep0ublic.
   Mairead Farrell, 31; Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 24,
were unarmed and walking toward the Gibraltar-Spanish border when
British commandos in civilian clothes shot them March 6.
   British officials said the three had planned to detonate a car
bomb at a public military ceremony in Britain's fortress colony at
the southern tip of Spain two days later.
   Monday night British troops fatally shot a gunman near Savage's
Belfast home. Police identified the slain man as Kevin McCracken,
33.
   A statement by Belfast police headquarters said McCracken fired
at an army patrol and the soldiers shot back. It said McCracken was
jailed in 1978 for membership in the outlawed Irish Republican Army
and illegal possession of guns. The report said McCracken was
released on parole in 1985.
   The coffins of the three slain guerrillas were carried into the
homes of their families in west Belfast.
   Hundreds of police and soldiers, many in riot gear, were on duty
as the funeral procession arrived in Belfast.
   At Newry, five miles north of the border town of Carrickaron in
the Irish Republic, the hearses with the bodies drove qround the
predominantly Catholic town for two hours Monday night and were
cheered by crowds of IRA supporters.
   But on the outskirts of Newry, 35 miles south of Belfast,
Protestants threw bricks, bottles and stones at the vehicles,
breaking some windows.
   Farther north at Loughbrickland and Banbridge Protestant crowds
again pelted the cortege with stones and shouted abuse as police
moved forward to disperse them.
   The hearses were escorted by police vehicles and followed by
dozens of cars containing IRA supporters.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said about
1,000 people met the coffins Monday when they arrived from
Gibraltar at Dublin's airport, many of them members of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's legal political arm.
   The cortege stopped briefly at the border at Carrickaron when
two senior officers of Northern Ireland's police force, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, ordered the Irish tricolors removed from the
coffins.
   Police, relatives of the slain guerrillas and Sinn Fein members
reached a compromise after a 30-minute argument and the flags were
folded up and left atop the coffins, covered with funeral wreaths.
   The IRA is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the British from
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic. At least 2,628 people
have been killed since sectarian violence began in Northern Ireland
in August 1969.
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and other senior party figures
led the airport reception. The coffins were draped in the green,
orange and white Irish flag and a priest recited prayers in Irish
and English.
   Four women in black jackets and trousers formed an honor guard.
A lone bagpiper played a lament.
   In the heavy mist, the coffins were transferred to three
hearses. A cortege led by police, which grew to more than 100 cars,
made its way along the 100-mile route to the border.
   About 20 cars continued from the border to Belfast, capital of
Northern Ireland, where the three will be buried Wednesday or
Thursday.
   Thousands of people lined the roads. Scores of teen-agers held
black flags at waist level as the convoy passed through the
Catholic town of Drogheda. Many drivers threw black flags from
their car windows.
   On both sides of the border, black flags hung from lampposts
along the route.
   The procession took three hours to cover the 60 miles to Dundalk
on the border, where 5,000 people turned out. Another lone piper
escorted the hearses through the town. An honor guard of four men
and two women dressed in black marched beside them.
   Royal Air Force soldiers loaded the coffins onto the jet in
Gibraltar because baggage workers would not handle them, British
television networks reported.
   In Northern Ireland, the IRA said it fired a three-volley rifle
salute at a shrine in Belfast to coincide with the bodies' arrival
on Irish soil.
   An IRA statement circulated by Sinn Fein said the guerrillas
wished the bereaved families ``peaceful and dignified funerals,''
which was seen as a possible hint that the funerals would be
allowed to take place without demonstrations.
   In the past, funerals have been disrupted by hooded IRA members
firing salutes over the coffins and the police moving in to arrest
them.
   Police in the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland
were expected to mount a huge security operation to prevent such
displays this time.
   Sinn Fein said the three guerrillas would be buried at Milltown
Cemetery in Belfast on Wednesday or on Thursday, Saint Patrick's
Day. Relatives of the dead appealed for calm and a Roman Catholic
bishop asked police and mourners to avoid violence.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it would intervene if
necessary to stop armed displays at the funerals.

   Pressure mounted Monday on Pakistan to sign an
Afghan settlement aimed at securing the withdrawal of an estimated
115,000 Soviet troops and end nine years of fighting in Afghanistan.
   Sources close to the talks said the Pakistani chief
representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, received a
message from the Kremlin calling upon him to sign the documents
without further delay.
   The chief Afghan negotiator, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil,
scheduled a news conference for Tuesday, the day Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev named as a target date for the conclusion of
the nearly 6-year-old talks. Gorbachev said Moscow will bring home
its troops starting May 15 if the settlement is signed Tuesday.
   Both sides have said they do not consider March 15 a rigid
deadline. Sources close to the talks, who declined to be
identified, said that apart from pressing for the formation of an
interim government, Pakistan also felt that there are still some
loose ends to be sorted out in the agreements that make up the
peace package.
   The Soviet deputy foreign minister, Vadim Loginov, told a news
conference in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on Monday that Moscow is still
``optimistic'' it can pull its troops out, but he acknowledged the
Geneva talks are encountering difficulties.
   ``Nobody has set a definite deadline,'' he said. ``All that has
been said is that if by the 15th (of March), the last of the four
agreements has been signed, then we will begin to withdraw our
forces.''
   Pakistan has been insisting that the formation of a transitional
government in Afghanistan be linked to the settlement.
   Both Kabul and Moscow have adamantly rejected that condition.
   Pakistan argues that only a broad-based government can guarantee
implementation of the peace accords and the safe return of five
million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
   ``We are ready to sign the moment our concerns are removed,''
Noorani told reporters as his delegation left an afternoon meeting
with U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez.
   Before an earlier meeting in the morning, Noorani had said,
without elaborating, Pakistan would ``announce something today.''
But there was no such announcement as the talks were adjourned
until Tuesday.
   In Belgrade, where he was on a state visit, Gorbachev was asked
by a reporter if there was progress at the Geneva talks. With a
smile, he said, ``There is,'' and ``There will be,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Najib, president of Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government, accused
Pakistan Monday of using tricks to block the final agreement.
   ``It can be said candidly that that people who resort to ruses
and who don't want the document of the Geneva talks to be signed
are actually enemies of the refugees,'' Najib was quoted as saying
in an interview with the Afghan news agency Bakhtar excerpted by
Tass, the official Soviet news agency.
   Najib noted that Pakistan once said the only issue between the
two countries was an acceptable timetable for Soviet withdrawal. He
charged that Pakistan raised questions about an interim government
to delay the agreement.
   Najib said the rebels are interested in the millions of Afghan
refugees only as a ``reserve of military force to be used as cannon
fodder.''
   Noorani, meanwhile, was reported to be in constant touch with
his capital, Islamabad, where the cabinet held its third lengthy
meeting in two days, presumably to weigh its next step. The Swiss
Radio reported earlier that Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo had
said a decision on whether Pakistan would sign the settlement would
be made Monday.
   In another development, a spokesman for the fragile seven-party
alliance of the anti-Soviet guerrillas, revealed that Moscow had
rejected again any direct negotiations with the insurgents.
   The spokesman, Gulbadin Hekmatyar, who also leads the largest
and most radical group in the alliance, said that no guerrilla
delegation would be sent to Geneva unless the Soviets drop their
opposition.
   Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hezb-i-islami group, is widely
believed to be the next chief of the seven-party alliance following
the resignation of Yunis Khalis for health reasons.
   Unconfirmed reports indicated the 69-year-old Khalis quit in
protest over plans to send a guerrilla delegation to the Geneva
talks.
   Hekmatyar said his appointment as leader of the alliance may be
announced Tuesday.
   ``But if there is a majority opposing my leadership, then I will
not be chosen,'' he added, speaking in Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   Only a month ago, Bob Dole looked ready to
wrest the Republican presidential nomination from George Bush. Now,
he is desperately looking for ways to keep his White House hopes
from being wiped out by Bush Bush in today's Illinois primary.
   In mid-February, everything was looking up for Dole. He had
scored an upset win in the Iowa caucuses, and as the New Hampshire
primary approached, polls were suggesting he could overtake the
vice president in the state.
   But in one 48-hour stretch _ the final two days before the
voting in New Hampshire _ the Dole campaign derailed, and has never
gotten back on track.
   A combination of body blows _ weak organization, poor planning,
a mean image and just bad luck _ has reduced the formidable
minority leader of the Senate to a battered, struggling candidate.
   With the vice president leading 2-to-1 in the Illinois polls,
the question Dole faces over and over is when _ not if _ he will
withdraw.
   Dole said it will not be today or Wednesday: ``I've made a
judgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we're going to keep
going.''
   From the start, Dole was judged a tough contender for the 1988
nomination. A seasoned politician with national stature, the Kansas
senator was one Republican who could match Bush in fund-raising,
name recognition and experience.
   But there were doubts about Dole as well, doubts that all came
to the surface the weekend before the New Hampshire primary Feb. 16
_ ``the 48 hours that cost them the campaign'' is how one
Republican professional described those days.
   ``He was ready to put Bush away,'' said GOP pollster Lance
Tarrance, who worked for former candidate Jack Kemp.
   Dole was riding the wave out of his big early win _ a triumph in
the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8. Bush was a disappointing third behind
former television evangelist Pat Robertson. That should have meant
a big boost for Dole for the New Hampshire primary the next week.
   ``You need some luck...and Dole didn't get much good luck out of
Iowa,'' Tarrance said. ``The news of Robertson beating out
Bush...was the big story.''
   Dole did start picking up strength in New Hampshire. Bush was
down, and changing his style as his campaign struggled to recover.
   But by Thursday of that week, Bush was on the counterattack,
readying ads accusing Dole of ``straddling'' major issues. And the
Dole campaign could not get its act together to respond.
   One television commercial attacking Bush _ called ``Footsteps''
inside the campaign _ was ready Thursday. But top aides viewed it
and judged it ``unusable'' because of poor production and problems
with the script, said two sources who spoke on the condition they
not be named.
   Dole tried twice that week to make a new spot, promising to veto
any tax increases, but once again aides judged it not usable, a top
Dole adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   When the new ads were ready late Friday, the Dole campaign
couldn't get them on the air. The television stations were closing
for the weekend, making it harder to switch the tapes at the
stations.
   ``They couldn't get the old ads off the air and the new ones
on,'' said the GOP professional, who is not working for any
campaign. ``That's what the campaign is supposed to be able to do.
They didn't.''
   Then it was on to the South, where Bush rode President Reagan's
popularity and his own solid organization to a wipeout win over
Dole on Super Tuesday.
   Organizational problems have been a trademark of Dole campaigns
from the start. The wily Senate operator was loath to delegate
authority and had a penchant for snarling lines of authority,
several Dole aides said.
   Former Labor Secretary Bill Brock was brought into run the
campaign on Nov. 1, but that was probably too late.
   ``The Bush campaign has been working on strategy for years,''
said the GOP pro.
   For example, the Bush campaign had prepared long and hard for
the possibility of an Iowa loss. In contrast, the Dole campaign
found itself pumping up expectations of a victory in New Hampshire,
when even aides said the preferable course would have been to talk
of how tough it would be to beat Bush in his own backyard.
   And after the New Hampshire loss, the image of a mean Bob Dole
came back to haunt him. He snapped at Bush in a television
interview that Bush's ads were lying about Dole's record.
   The chaos in the final days of the New Hampshire campaign was
eerily echoed in Illinois.
   Dole went into the state saying he had to win, then backed off
on that contention. He made deep cutbacks in his staff, and let the
word leak out before he made an explanation. He abruptly moved to
pull ads off the air, giving rise to rumors he was throwing in the
towel.
   To top it all off, his half-hour address to the voters of
Illinois on Saturday night was hit by technical problems.
   ``He did it to himself,'' said GOP consultant Eddie Mahe of
Dole. ``The voters can't see any big differences between them on
the issues. What they did is make their decisions on personality
and style.''
   Mahe said the GOP voters saw each man face defeat in a key early
contest _ Bush in Iowa and Dole in New Hamsphire. And they liked
what they saw in Bush more.

<HEAD>Israel Imposes Curfew On 600,000 Palestinians In Gaza Strip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel imposed a nightly curfew on more than
600,000 Arabs in the entire Gaza Strip and reportedly sealed off
entrances to the occupied territory after about 300 Arab policemen
in Gaza said they would resign.
   The army on Monday also closed one of the West Bank's largest
fruit and vegetable markets as Israel tightened economic sanctions
in the occupied lands.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers on Monday shot and
wounded 11 Palestinians, hospital officials said. A 3-year-old girl
was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet, and five Israelis were
injured by stones thrown by Arabs.
   Israel radio said the 300 Arab policemen in the Gaza Strip
announced Monday they would resign. They joined 450 officers in the
occupied lands who turned in their badges earlier following orders
of PLO-inspired underground leaflets.
   The curfew in Gaza, announced Monday, was a reaction to the
resignations, the radio said. The 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew also was
designed to prevent ``the entrance of violent instigators ... and
of written instigation material,'' it said. The army said the
curfew was to prevent late night demonstrations.
   The curfew over the entire Gaza Strip was imposed for the first
time since Arab unrest started on Dec. 8. It forces the residents
to stay in their homes while entrances to Gaza are sealed off by
the army, the radio said.
   An army spokesman said the curfew would be imposed until further
notice.
   At the Erez checkpoint at the entrance to Gaza, AP photographer
Max Nash on Monday saw 15 to 20 Arab trucks and taxis prevented by
the army from entering.
   He said soldiers would let in army vehicles and cars belonging
to Jewish settlers who live in Gaza. Other Israelis and journalists
were not permitted to drive in. ``Where would we sleep? We want to
enter, all our families are inside,'' an Arab worker stopped at
Erez told Israel radio.
   The situation in Gaza's refugee camps was not immediately clear.
On Sunday night, the army cut electricity and telephone lines to
41,000 people in the Beach Camp, an Arab reporter said.
   Israeli authorities acknowledged that some policemen in the Gaza
Strip quit but gave no figures. About 850 Arab policemen work in
the occupied territories.
   The police control crime and direct traffic, but they are not
used to quell Arab rioting in the occupied lands.
   ``It is clear their resignations were not handed in freely but
because they fear for their lives,'' Gaza police commander Shimon
Levy said on Israel radio.
   Graffiti on the walls in Gaza City called for the resignation of
the Israeli-appointed mayor and city council, Israel Television
said.
   In response to the PLO-backed unrest, Israel stepped up economic
sanctions. Shipment of gasoline and other fuel to service stations
in the West Bank was banned as of Sunday, and a regional fruit and
vegetable market was closed on Monday in Jericho, 20 miles
northwest of Jerusalem.
   Arab merchants said 70 trucks carrying produce were turned away
Monday. In addition, the army ordered Jericho shop owners to close
during the morning hours when PLO leaflets said shops should be
open. Israel Television said the Arab merchants responded with a
total commercial strike.
   The economic test of wills continued on Monday in Gaza City,
where slogans painted in the red, green, white and black colors of
the outlawed Palestinian flag called for a two-day general strike
starting today.
   Protests were reported on Monday in Jenin and the nearby West
Bank village of Yamoun, where troops using live ammunition shot and
wounded 11 people, hospital officials said. According to United
Nations figures, at least 91 Palestinians have been killed since
anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8.
   Witnesses said Jewish settlers on Monday drove through the West
Bank town of Ramallah and nearby Al Amari refugee camp, honking
their horns. Witnesses said Palestinians then held a similar car
demonstration, during which soldiers shot 3-year-old Rasha Yussef
Said in the eye with a rubber bullet.

<HEAD>New ATV Settlement Stresses Advertising, Safety Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advertising for all-terrain vehicles will
begin stressing safety under a new agreement that also calls on
makers of the off-road vehicles to set up new training programs and
limit ATV sales.
   The government on Monday disclosed the new settlement, which
could replace a preliminary agreement announced in December.
   The recreational vehicles have grown sharply in popularity in
recent years, with more than 2 million currently believed to be in
use.
   At the same time accidents have increased markedly, with more
than 900 fatalities reported in the last five years, as well as
300,000 injuries, according to information collected by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   That led to a government safety investigation and the new
agreement by the commission, the Justice Department, and the five
manufacturers of the machines: Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki and
Polaris Industries.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will hold a hearing on the
settlement April 18 and could order it into effect immediately. It
would replace the preliminary agreement between the government and
the manufacturers announced on Dec. 30.
   Safety Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon said through a
spokesman that the settlement is the biggest safety accomplishment
in the history of his agency.
   Commission general counsel James V. Lacy said the settlement
will continue the ban on sales of new three-wheeled ATVs and that
manufacturers have agreed to buy back any of the three-wheel
versions remaining in dealer inventories.
   The more stable four-wheel ATVs will still be sold, he said, but
marketing of the full-size versions with engines of 90 cubic
centimeters and over will be limited to riders aged 16 and over.
Smaller machines will be allowed to be sold for riders ages 12 to
16, he said.
   The commission vote was 2-1, with Scanlon and commissioner Carol
Dawson in favor and commissioner Anne Graham dissenting. Graham,
who also voted against the preliminary settlement in December, said
in a statement that the settlement should have allowed ATV owners
to obtain refunds.
   ``Without the refund, consumers are not obtaining the remedies
necessary given the nature and severity of the hazards presented by
ATVs,'' she said.
   The new 150-page settlement is much more detailed than the one
announced in December, which drew criticism from Congress and
consumer groups as not being extensive enough. Some consumer groups
have said all the vehicles should be recalled because of safety
problems.
   Lacy said the settlement calls for the manufacturers to spend
between $8.4 million and $8.6 million on advertising starting in
the fall.
   The ads will stress the inherent safety risks of the vehicles,
Lacy said, and will be placed in a variety of media. Included, he
said, would be advertising on such broadcasts as the World Series,
CBS Evening News and Monday Night Football.
   In addition the manufacturers have agreed to set up a national
headquarters to develop safety and training programs for riders,
and to provide hands-on training for all new purchasers and for all
consumers who bought the machines since Dec. 30, 1986.
   Buyers will be offered incentives such as $50 in cash, a $100
savings bond or merchandise certificates to induce them to take the
training programs, Lacy said.
   Other provisions of the agreement, he said, include:
   _New warning labels on the machines being sold, plus mailings
providing these labels for all current owners for whom the
manufacturers have addresses.
   _The hands-on training programs for new buyers will include
their immediate families also.
   _Development of new owners manuals with added safety information.
   _Establishment of a safety hotline for consumers to get
information and development of safety-related videos to be made
available at dealer showrooms.
   _Elimination of the safety verification form that had been
required as part of the earlier settlement.
   This form, in which a buyer acknowledges knowing of the hazards
of the machines, had been criticized by consumer groups, who said
it could be used to protect the manufacturers in case of lawsuits
stemming from accidents.

<HEAD>Doctors Should Rule Out Look-Alike Diseases in Mysterious Fatigue
Syndrome</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should rule out a long list of ills, such
as AIDS and alcoholism, before they decide patients are afflicted
with a baffling, newly recognized ailment called chronic fatigue
syndrome, researchers say.
   In the past, the illness has been referred to as the yuppie
disease, because some of its victims are young professionals, or
more formally, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome or chronic mononucleosis.
   In a report published in the March issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine, 16 top researchers in this field agreed to call
it chronic fatigue syndrome, and settled on a definition for the
afflication.
   The definition largely involves ruling out other illnesses that
can cause similar symptoms, including the hallmark of the syndrome,
extreme fatigue.
   ``It's a diagnosis of exclusion, and it has to be considered as
such even after you've ruled everything else out,'' said Dr. Gary
P. Holmes, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and chief author
of the report.
   ``You have to continue to be concerned that there is something
else going on,'' he added. ``You have to keep an open mind and not
simply close the books.''
   Another co-author, Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said the new definition should help
researchers as well as doctors who are faced with patients who have
heard of the illness and think they have it.
   ``Many of them have other physical illnesses, or they are
depressed or anxious,'' he said. ``Doctors need an anchor to help
distinguish patients with chronic fatigue syndrome from patients
who have other kinds of fatigue.''
   According to the definition, people with the syndrome must have
suffered debilitating fatigue for at least six months. It must be
bad enough to reduce daily activity by at least half.
   Doctors also must rule out a long list of diseases that can
mimic the symptoms of the syndrome. These include cancer,
tuberculosis, AIDS, depression, diabetes, alcoholism, poisoning and
kidney disease, among many other disorders.
   In addition, patients must show signs of at least eight of 11
other possible conditions. These are mild fever, sore throat,
painful lymph nodes, generalized muscle weakness, muscle
discomfort, headaches, painful joints, sleep problems, sudden onset
of the symptoms, such neurological problems as trouble
concentrating, confusion or forgetfulness and general fatigue
lasting at least 24 hours after exercise that the patient easily
could have withstood when healthy.
   When the disease first received widespread attention three years
ago, doctors believed it was somehow linked with the Epstein-Barr
virus, because some victims showed signs of activation of that
common virus. However, many experts now say that Epstein-Barr virus
is not associated with the illness, since victims are just as
likely to show exposure to the viruses that cause measles, genital
herpes and cold sores, among other things.
   Although the CDC has received thousands of questions about the
illness from patients and doctors, no one knows how many people
have it.
   Its cause also is a mystery. Some believe it can be triggered by
persistant infections with a variety of viruses. Among the suspects
are a group of microbes called the enteroviruses as well as a newly
discovered virus known as human herpes virus 6.
   Researchers suggest it's a reaction to these lingering
infections rather than the mischief of the viruses themselves that
makes people feel poorly.
   ``My theory is that certain viruses are able to escape ever
being fully eradicated by the body,'' said Komaroff.
   ``They come back to fight again. You have a constant Iran-Iraq
war where the battles are continual. The process of doing battle
and mobilizing the body's immune system causes some of the symptoms
of feeling ill.''
   Holmes noted that the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome are
similar to those experienced by people treated with the natural
hormone interferon.
   ``Interferon is the body's normal response to a viral
infection,'' Holmes said. ``It may be that something like
overproduction of interferon for a prolonged period may be causing
the illness.''

   The confrontation in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip has increasingly become an economic test of wills
between Israeli occupation authorities and Palestinians.
   Underground Palestinian leaders have persuaded many merchants
and ordinary citizens to stop paying taxes and have enforced
repeated strikes, keeping at home a large part of the 110,000
laborers who work in Israel.
   The measures are designed to make Israel bear more of the
economic burden for occupation, which Arab activists say will give
impetus to Israel's withdrawal. Israel has adopted increasingly
tough economic sanctions, some of which are designed to put the
squeeze on the Arab middle class.
   The army imposed an indefinite ban on trucks taking gasoline to
the West Bank's 50 service stations. The move crippled public and
private transport.
   Qabatiyeh, a West Bank village of several thousand people, was
banned from exporting its quarried rock to Jordan and visitors from
abroad will not be allowed to visit the village, Israeli officials
said.
   The move was punishment for the lynching of an alleged
collaborator who was hung from an electricty pole after he fired
into a crowd advancing on his home and fatally wounded a child.
   In Jericho, the army closed a regional produce market and
ordered shops to close during morning hours, when PLO leaflets said
the shops should be open.
   ``The military government is trying to tell the people here who
is boss. They want to hurt the people economically. I think they
intend to try to break the strike this way,'' said Saeb Erakat, a
political science professor at Al Najah University.
   Israeli authorities have selectively used other measures as
well, such as cutting off electricity to areas placed under curfew.
   Israeli officials say they hope such steps will encourage
moderates to put pressure on Palestinian militants, although there
is no sign that such measures are having the desired effect.
   ``Agitators on the Arab side want to disconnect the population
as much as possible from any connection with Israel,'' said a
senior official in the military administration of the occupied
territories.
   He said the tax rebellion had minimal impact in January and
February, leading to a 10 percent decline in revenues, or about
$200,000 a month.
   But he said collections were expected to be far lower in March
and that road repairs, garbage collection and other services in the
occupied territories could suffer if there was not enough income to
fund the $239 million budget of the army-run Civil Administration.
   To counter the tax boycott, authorities required Arabs to obtain
a certificate saying they paid their taxes before getting
import-export licenses, driver's permits and other documents.
   Israel also lowered the amount of money Palestinians could bring
from abroad without permission from $5,000 to $1,200.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more
economic sanctions were being considered to quell the revolt, which
began Dec. 8. and has resulted in the death of more than 90 Arabs.
He declined to elaborate.
   But Arieh Shalev, former head of the army-run military
government in 1974-76, said it might be necessary to stop Arabs
from working in Israel or using the bridges to trade with Jordan.
   ``Violence has peaked, in my opinion, but it will continue and
it's doubtful whether it will stop without taking brutal (economic)
measures,'' Shalev said on Israel radio.
   Ephraim Kleiman, an economics professor at Hebrew University,
said Israel was better positioned to endure a showdown than the
Palestinians.
   ``The occupied territories are dependent for income on three
things: work in Israel, the export of agricultural goods and
quarried stone to Jordan, and financial support from Arab
countries,'' he said in an interview.
   He said Arab job boycotts would deal a ``serious blow'' to the
construction industry, textile factories, restaurants and garbage
collection. But overall, he said, the ``economic impact on Israel
is much smaller.''
   Arab economists disputed the contention. ``We are prepared to
suffer more than the Israelis,'' said Samir Hazboun, a Bir Zeit
University economist.
   He said the tax rebellion had added to Israel's cost of
continuing the occupation and that bad publicity abroad had
affected investment and tourism.

<HEAD>Koch Greets New Austrian Ambassador With Waldheim Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Austrian ambassador to the United
Nations came bearing gifts to Mayor Edward I. Koch, but the mayor
greeted him with a diatribe against Austria's president, Kurt
Waldheim.
   ``I think he's a bad guy. He was just one of those obsequious
guys when he was here, before I knew he was a war criminal. And I
had dinner with him a couple of times,'' Koch on Monday told Peter
Hohenfellner, who became the permanent Austrian representative at
the United Nations in February.
   ``You'll forgive me if I'm honest, OK, and it's not intended as
anything but honesty because I have the highest regard for your
chancellor.''
   Waldheim, who was secretary-general of the United Nations, has
come under fire since files were uncovered that suggest he had a
greater role than he has admitted as an officer in the Nazi army
during World War II. There are reports that Waldheim knew about
atrocities being committed against partisans and villagers where he
was stationed.
   Waldheim has stood fast against the accusations and refused to
resign as president. He has been banned as an undesireable from
United States.
   Koch told Hohenfellner that Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
was invited to dinner the next time he comes to the United States.
   ``I'd like him to stay at Gracie Mansion,'' Koch said of the
mayor's residence. ``I wouldn't do that for the president. ... For
the president, this city is off limits.''
   The mayor gave Hohenfellner a tie and the ambassador gave him a
19th century goblet Koch said he would use at Passover.

   Country singer Johnny Cash ended a
three-city South Dakota tour here with an unwelcome non-musical
sidekick _ the hiccups.
   ``This is an all-time first for me,'' Cash told his audience in
the Corn Palace. ``It's the first time I've done a show with the
hiccups.''
   Cash, who also had a recent bout with the flu, sipped water
during Sunday afternoon's performance. He even left the stage for a
short time to try unsuccessfully to get rid of his hiccups.
   He and his wife, June Carter Cash, performed to the audience of
2,000 for about two hours.

   Doctors removed singer Dennis Day
from the critical list after he responded to treatment for a head
injury he suffered last week in a fall at home.
   His condition was upgraded to serious Monday after surgery
Saturday relieved swelling of the brain, said Armen Markarian,
spokesman for St. John's Hospital.
   Day, 71, was diagnosed last July as suffering from amyotropic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, a progressive nerve
disorder that causes loss of muscle control.
   Day became famous by performing with comedian Jack Benny
starting in 1939. An accomplished Irish tenor, Day also was known
for playing the innocent foil to Benny's irascible character on
television and radio.

   The Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid leader,
says productions such as the movie ``Cry Freedom'' and the musical
``Sarafina'' play important roles in publicizing the struggle of
blacks in his native South Africa.
   ``You cannot reach everybody by making a speech, or even by
saying something on television,'' Boesak said in an interview in
April's Essence magazine.
   ``Some other people are more convinced by reading a book, by
meeting someone face to face, by seeing a play, by seeing a movie.
I believe that if you get all these different audiences, and you
speak to them in a medium that they can understand, then so much
the better.''
   Boesak, 41, is a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Under South
Africa's racially restrictive laws, which reserve most power for
the white minority, he is considered of mixed race.
   The magazine said writer and former Black Panther leader Elaine
Brown interviewed Boesak when he and his wife, Dorothy, and four
children were in Los Angeles recently.

   Having a newborn baby won't keep
three-time Grammy-winner Deniece Williams from the recording
studio, her publicist says.
   Miss Williams, 35, who gave birth Saturday, is planning to
record an album next month, press agent Bob Angelotti says.
   ``Mother and child are doing fine'' but will remain in the
hospital for several days, he said.
   Forrest Matthew Westering, who weighed 9 pounds, 3 ounces at
birth, is the first child for the singer and her husband, Brad
Westering, who were married in 1986. Miss Williams has two children
from a previous marriage.
   Miss Williams began her career as a backup singer for Stevie
Wonder. In 1978, she recorded a No. 1 single, ``Too Much, Too
Little, Too Late,'' with Johnny Mathis. She recently won her third
Grammy, best female gospel performance, for ``I Believe in You'' on
the album ``Water Under the Bridge.''

   Retired Brig. Gen. Chuck Yeager, the first
man to fly faster than the speed of sound, will drive the pace car
in the 1988 Indianapolis 500, race officials say.
   The announcement was made Monday at a ceremony in which General
Motors officials presented the keys for 66 black 1988 Cutlass
Supremes to Speedway president Joe Cloutier. The cars are replicas
of the open-top Cutlass that will pace the 72nd Indianapolis 500 on
May 29.
   Yeager, who retired from active duty in the Air Force in 1975,
set his flight speed record on Oct. 14, 1947. He works as a
consultant test-pilot for Northrop Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and the flight test center at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Yeager also drove the pace car in the 1986 Indy 500.

<HEAD>Railey Misses Deadline in Lawsuit, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former minister Walker Railey has decided not to
contest a civil suit accusing him of choking his wife nearly to
death, Railey's attorney said Monday.
   Doug Mulder told the Dallas Morning News that Railey's decision
was based on estimates that it would cost nearly $100,000 in legal
fees to dispute the lawsuit filed Feb. 2 by Railey's mother-in-law,
Billie Jo Nicolai.
   ``He told me that he had decided his assets would be best used
in the support and maintenance of his children,'' said Mulder, who
represented Railey before a Dallas County grand jury investigating
the attack.
   Railey, 40, missed a Monday deadline for answering the suit,
which seeks unspecified damages, said Bill Arnold, an attorney for
Mrs. Nicolai.
   In absence of a response, a judge could rule against the former
senior minister of the First United Methodist Church of Dallas and
award damages.
   Peggy Railey, 39, has been in a coma since she was found
unconscious on the floor of her garage last April. She had been
choked.
   Railey was not charged, but both his attorney and Assistant
District Attorney Norm Kinne identified the former minister as the
prime suspect.
   Railey denied any involvement but refused to cooperate with
police, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination 43 times when questioned by a grand jury.
   Mrs. Railey remains in a Tyler nursing home. Railey, who now
lives in San Francisco, has assigned her guardianship to her
parents, and that of his two children to family friends.
   ``The question now is when do I want to go to court and ask for
a default judgment,'' Arnold said Monday. ``It could be tomorrow or
it could be a couple of months. It depends on Peggy's best
interests.''

<TEXT>
   Jane Byrne and Ed Vrdolyak, once on the same team
pulling the levers of city government, are on the comeback trail,
this time by trying to throw a monkey wrench into each other's
plans.
   Mrs. Byrne, the former mayor, says her last attempt at office
will be today when she runs in the Democratic primary for clerk of
the nation's largest local court system.
   Vrdolyak, a former alderman and former chairman of the powerful
Cook County Democratic Party, wants the same office. But he's now a
Republican running unopposed in the GOP primary.
   A victory by either candidate in November's general election
could give a jump start to his or her political future. But a loss
could be politically fatal.
   ``It's a position that has some patronage, it has jobs,'' said
Paul Kleppner, a social scientist at Northern Illinois University
and analyst of Chicago politics.
   ``More important than the number of jobs, if you're an
office-holder, you can grab the media. As Jane Byrne once said, the
new precinct captain in this age is television,'' Kleppner said
Monday.
   Mrs. Byrne was in a tough primary race with Aurelia Pucinski,
the county Democratic Party's endorsed candidate and daughter of
fiery Alderman Roman Pucinski.
   Mrs. Byrne, mayor from 1979 to 1983, was ousted by Harold
Washington, who became the city's first black chief executive and
then withstood an election challenge from her last year.
   Besides announcing proposals to streamline the court system's
bureaucracy and broaden services for county residents outside
Chicago, Mrs. Byrne and Mrs. Pucinski have mostly haggled over who
had the late mayor's affection.
   Washington supported Mrs. Pucinski and the party's slate of
endorsed candidates just a few days before he died Nov. 23.
   But in Mrs. Byrne's effort to appeal to Chicago's powerful black
voting bloc, she points to a unity breakfast she had with
Washington after he won the primary last February.
   Mrs. Byrne also pulls out a newspaper article that quotes Mrs.
Pucinski as saying she wasn't Washington's first choice for the
clerk's job.
   Mrs. Pucinski has countered with a radio blitz featuring
prominent black politicians and even Washington's half brother,
Ramon Price.
   ``Harold believed we had come too far to go back to the days of
the bosses. ... That's why Harold chose Aurelia Pucinski,'' Price
says on the ad, broadcast on black-oriented radio stations.
   But Mrs. Pucinski's alderman father was viewed among blacks as
an obstructionist during Washington's reign as mayor.
   ``I would expect Byrne to get the black vote,'' Kleppner said.
``The question is how much.''
   Vrdolyak, an alderman for 15 years, lost power to Washington in
the City Council and waged an unsuccessful bid against him on a
third-party ticket last April. Vrdolyak subsequently resigned from
the chairmanship of the county Democratic organization to become a
Republican.
   With no primary opponent, Vrdolyak has spent most of his time
talking about demanding integrity and honesty from the court
system's 2,000 employees.
   He's also portraying Democrats as big taxers and spenders,
hoping to get conservative Democratic voters to join his cause in
November. At a rally Sunday for Vice President George Bush,
Vrdolyak said ``they don't represent you.''
   ``They don't hardly represent anybody any more,'' he said.
   If Mrs. Byrne survives the primary and meets Vrdolyak in
November, the clerk's race will feature two former allies. Vrdolyak
was her floor leader in the City Council, and she once helped
install him as chairman of the county Democratic Party.
   Today, the affection is lost.
   ``He's devious. He's a wheeler-dealer,'' she told a newspaper
last week. ``It's distasteful. ... I don't like him. He's not my
cup of tea.''

   Two hundred arrests were reported Monday as
anti-nuclear protesters tried to block buses carrying thousands of
workers to the nation's nuclear testing grounds.
   The protesters slowed traffic into the Nevada Test Site, 65
miles northwest of Las Vegas, but failed to halt work, said Energy
Department spokesman Chris West.
   The majority of those arrested were carried away by officers
after lying down on the main road leading into the sprawling desert
site.
   Later, many of those arrested had to be dragged by police off
buses in Tonopah, Nev., about 135 miles away, where they were taken
to be booked before being released.
   ``They weren't going to stand for being driven 135 miles away
and being let loose,'' said protest spokeswoman Trudy Mason.
   The Nye County Sheriff's Department said officers decided to
remove the protesters from three buses and from the Tonopah
convention center, which was serving as a booking facility, after
they refused for several hours to be released.
   ``They just sat down and went limp and we dragged them out of
there,'' said Capt. George Gumbmann. Mason claimed some of the
protesters were injured, but Gumbmann said he knew of no injuries.
   Monday's arrests followed a demonstration Saturday by up to
5,000 people, the largest in more than seven years of protests at
the site. Police arrested 1,240 people that day, mostly on
misdemeanor trespass citations.
   A spokesman for the American Peace Test, which is sponsoring the
demonstrations, said 50 protesters had infiltrated the
1,350-square-mile site, which is the size of Rhode Island.
   West said he was unaware of any such incidents, but said any
infiltrators would not be able to reach sensitive areas.
   American Peace Test estimated there were 200 protesters at the
site Monday, but West said the number was closer to 400.
   He said 300 personnel from the Nye County Sheriff's Office, the
Nevada Highway Patrol and Wackenhut Security remained on duty or on
standby.
   The protests are scheduled to continue through Sunday.

   Darden, who was scheduled to be electrocuted at 7 a.m. at
Florida State Prison, has maintained his innocence in the 1973
fatal shooting of a Lakeland furniture store owner during a robbery.
   His case has been the focus of an international campaign against

   The dissenting votes were cast by justices William J. Brennan,

   The following is a look at the main points of
disagreement between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on the Middle East peace process.
   
   LAND FOR PEACE
   Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc opposes giving up any part of the
occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip in exchange for peace. Instead,
Shamir calls for the implementation of the 1978 U.S.-mediated Camp
David accords signed by Israel and Egypt.
   The agreement says Palestinians should be granted self-rule on
domestic matters while leaving security and foreign affairs to
Israel. After three years of autonomy, Israel and the Arabs would
negotiate a final status for the occupied lands. Shamir believes
handing occupied territories back to the Arabs would endanger
Israel's existence by leaving it smaller and more vulnerable.
   Peres' left-of-center Labor Party is ready to enter negotiations
with Jordan, from which Israel seized the West Bank, which would
involve returning parts of the occupied lands. Peres says Israel
would insist on retaining Arab east Jerusalem and holding on to
areas along the Jordan River as a ``security border.'' His guiding
principle is to hand back as much of the heavily populated
Palestinian areas as possible, above all the Gaza Strip, taken from
Egypt. The West Bank and the Gaza Strip were occupied during the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Today 1.5 million Palestinians live in the occupied territories
along with 65,000 Jewish settlers. Peres is afraid that if Israel
keeps the territories, it will quickly lose its Jewish majority
because of the high Arab birth rate.
   
   THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE
   The international peace conference idea calls for negotiations
between Israel and Arab representatives under the aegis of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   Shamir rejects the notion outright. He claims four of the five
powers side with the Arabs and will have the power to force Israel
to give up the occupied lands. He believes the United States will
side with them on this issue. He also fears the Palestine
Liberation Organization will be invited to join the talks.
   As a concession to international involvement, he has suggested
the United States and the Soviet Union invite Israel and Jordan to
talks, leaving them to negotiate on their own after a ceremonial
meeting of the four delegations.
   Peres believes Jordan will negotiate only within an
international forum and that Israel must accept this condition if
it wants to talk peace. He says the conference will be only an
``opening'' of direct talks between Israel and a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. He argues the conference will not
have the power to impose its will or interfere in direct
negotiations and says the PLO will not attend the talks.
   
   THE SHULTZ PLAN
   The peace initiative by Secretary of State George P. Shultz is
an attempt to bridge the gap among moderate Arabs, Peres and
Shamir. It calls for convening an international conference in
April, followed by direct talks between Israel and a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation on Palestinian self-rule. In
December, even if autonomy negotiations were still going on, the
sides would begin talks on a permanent settlement.
   Shamir says the Shultz plan is ``cumbersome ... and does nothing
to guarantee the safety of Israel.'' His aides accuse the United
States of reneging on its commitment to the Camp David agreement.
Shamir is against negotiating a permanent settlement while talks on
the interim autonomy arrangements are still going on. He says the
idea of autonomy was to see whether Israelis and Palestinians could
live on a new footing before considering a permanent settlement.
   Peres accepts the Shultz plan, warning that it may be the last
chance in the forseeble future to make peace with the Arabs. He
says talks would be conducted while the Reagan government is in
office. He describes the Reagan administration as the freindliest
Israel has ever known.
   
   THE PLO
   Shamir and Peres both refuse to negotiate with the PLO. Peres
has left open the possibility of talking to the PLO if it renounces
violence and recognizes the Jewish state. Shamir will have nothing
to do with the organization.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. stumped Michigan today in
hopes the state will demonstrate he can win in the North, while he
kept his fingers crossed for ``a stronger result than people now
expect'' from Illinois' Democratic presidential primary.
   Gore was traveling to Lansing today where he planned to appear
with state legislators backing his candidacy before returning to
Washington.
   Arriving in Detroit Monday night, Gore described himself as a
``friend of organized labor'' and invoked the name of the state's
Democratic governor, who hasn't endorsed a candidate.
   ``I'm offering the politics of the future, very much in the way
Gov. Jim Blanchard has,'' Gore said.
   As he campaigned across Illinois earlier Monday, the Tennessee
senator contended he was encouraged about his prospects in today's
Illinois voting, despite a dismal single-digit showing in
pre-election polls.
   He pointed to Illinois' ``two favorite sons'' of Jesse Jackson
and Paul Simon, and the short time span since his crucial victories
in the South last week launched him as a contender, as an
explanation for his anticipated finish behind them and Michael
Dukakis.
   ``The polls have been wrong quite frequently in this race
because the voters are thinking for themselves,'' Gore said.
``There's a large undecided vote and people are looking for an
alternative.
   ``We've had only a few days to get the message out in
Illinois,'' he said later. He added that he hoped ``we're going to
have a stronger result than people now expect.''
   Gore avoided setting expectations in Michigan, where Democrats
hold caucuses on March 26, and where Richard Gephardt has chosen to
make a last stand in hopes of salvaging his candidacy that was
nearly knocked out in the South.
   ``I never single him out and certainly don't now,'' Gore said of
Gephardt. ``... It's a three-person race now between myself and
Jackson and Dukakis. That's the reality, regardless of what's
happening in any one state.''
   Gore said that no matter what the Illinois outcome, he and
Jackson and Dukakis would fight for the nomination across the
series of industrial states leading up to California's final
primary.
   ``There are other contests on down the road in Ohio,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York, and we're looking forward
to those contests _ and Michigan and Wisconsin _ all the way to
California,'' Gore said.
   ``We're going to compete everywhere and look for an opportunity
to punch through,'' he told reporters on his campaign plane.
   Gore depicted himself as the alternative to Dukakis and Jackson
``to bring the Democratic Party back in the mainstream.''
   At the University of Illinois, Gore appeared before the school's
super computer, a machine capable of millions of computations in an
instant, to call for increased federal money for computer research
and education. He accused the Reagan administration of starving
civilian computer research while putting money into military
applications.
   ``We are now on the verge of falling behind Japan, once again in
a field we pioneered,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, who toppled political
legend Edwin Edwards, opened his four-year term by challenging
Louisiana's residents to help ``clean up our politics.''
   ``Hope is diminishing. Attitudes have been damaged. Image is
tarnished. Pride has been wounded. We are down but we are not
out,'' said Roemer, inaugurated Monday as Louisiana's 51st governor.
   Roemer did not cite the usual litany of Louisiana's problems,
including high national rankings in unemployment, teen pregnancies,
high school dropouts, an almost bankrupt government of a state with
a widespread image of political corruption.
   The former Democratic congressman takes over a state with an
accumulated budget deficit and cash shortfall of as much as $1.2
billion, much of it due to the depressed oil industry.
   Roemer's legislative liasion, Manny Fernandez, said the
governor's first order of business would be to order a special
legislative session to give him wide budget-cutting authority for
the rest of the fiscal year, which ends June 30.
   The governor grabbed a major political victory even before he
took office when the Legislature approved his choices for House
speaker and Senate president.
   Roemer had said removal of the incumbent officers was needed to
ensure that his legislative programs would receive a fair hearing.
   Standing on the Capitol steps, Roemer was surrounded by 5,000
people. He was sworn in by former U.S. Sen. Russell Long, the son
of another legendary governor, Huey Long.
   ``Louisiana's victory will not be limited to the few or the
strong. That's not victory. That's just more of the same. We'll
bring the whole family on this victory trip,'' Roemer said.
   ``On behalf of our family, we declare war on ignorance, on
racism, on joblessness, on business as usual, on environmental
pollution and on dishonest political leadership. ...
   ``Do we have the character to clean up our politics, to free our
political leadership from the stranglehold of the special
interests? I say we do.''
   Roemer was interrupted frequently by applause, including
spirited clapping from Edwards, who conceded a runoff after
trailing Roemer in his Oct. 24 primary bid for an unprecedented
fourth term.
   Edwards, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned
for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last
administration defending himself successfully against federal
racketeering charges.
   ``I'm going hunting tomorrow,'' Edwards told reporters when
asked how he felt at the moment. ``It's his now.''

<HEAD>Capitol Police Gun Seizures up 147 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitol Police seized 1,162 weapons from
visitors last year, a 147 percent increase over 1986, and the House
sergeant at arms is lobbying for $18.5 million to tighten security.
   Capitol police are responsible for the Capitol itself, six
associated office buildings and the Capitol grounds. Sergeant at
Arms Jack Russ says the weapons confiscated last year included an
Uzi machine gun, a pistol disguised as a beeper and soda bottles
containing explosives.
   The 1,162 total compared to 470 weapons seized in 1986.
   The security plan advanced by Russ calls for installing
bomb-proof glass in the House visitors' gallery and modifying floor
seats in the chamber to protect against bomb blasts, at a cost of
$4.2 million.
   Other proposals include a $4.7 million emergency telephone
system to alert every House office immediately to a terrorist
attack, $413,352 worth of additional bomb detectors in House office
buildings, a $3.5 million electronic card system for access to
House garages, and a $5.7 million alarm system connecting
home-district offices with local police.
   Russ said most of the weapons were confiscated from visitors who
were unaware of gun control restrictions at the Capitol and had no
criminal intent. But of the total, 63 people were prosecuted, up
from 50 the previous year.
   Strict anti-terrorist proposals, such as fencing in the Capitol
grounds or putting glass enclosures around the House and Senate
visitors' galleries, have been widely criticized in the past. Many
legislators argue that the Capitol, as a symbol of open democracy,
should be easily accessible to the public.
   Russ says this view is unrealistic in view of growing security
threats.
   ``I think everybody _ me included _ would like the easy-going
atmosphere of a Mayberry RFD police force, with a friendly cop
directing traffic,'' he said in an interview. ``But in this day and
time, you also need a high-tech, well-trained police department.
You've got to have both.''
   Russ outlined his plan last week at a House Appropriations
subcommittee hearing on a proposed $1.96 billion budget for
congressional operations during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
His next step is to seek spending authority from a separate House
committee.
   Still awaiting final action by the House and Senate leadership
is a more sweeping security plan that calls for a wrought-iron
fence around the Capitol Plaza, a parking ban on the plaza and
gatehouses to screen visitors before they enter the Capitol grounds.
   That plan, scaled down from an earlier version, has been
approved by the Capitol Police Board, consisting of the House and
Senate sergeants at arms and Capitol Architect George White, but a
$13 million appropriation to implement the plan remains largely
unspent.
   Meanwhile, hydraulic steel street barricades have been installed
at the main traffic entrances to the Capitol to halt unauthorized
vehicles, and large concrete flower and shrubbery pots have been
placed along driveways and sidewalks to thwart any attempted truck
bombings of the Capitol.
   Russ said he hopes the bipartisan House and Senate leadership
will meet with their sergeants at arms before the end of April to
discuss the broader security plan. He said Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, has endorsed additional proposed security measures in the
House.

<HEAD>Secret Army Project Develops Uranium-Steel Armor for Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has secretly devised a new armor
plating for its main battle tank that combines uranium with steel
to produce an almost impenetrable skin, military officials say.
   ``We're talking about something so good the experts think it
will take the Russians almost a decade to catch up,'' said one
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``This is a major advance; a very major advance.''
   The Pentagon sources agreed to discuss the matter Monday after
the Army released a brief statement announcing plans to produce ``a
new model of the M-1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank with significantly
better armor.''
   ``The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporates
steel-encased depleted uranium,'' the service said.
   The development of the new armor has been under way for several
years as part of a highly classified ``black'' program, the sources
said. The Army relaxed the classification somewhat on Monday only
because it had to provide information to production line workers
and wanted to allay health concerns about using a radioactive
material in a manned vehicle, they added.
   In Monday's announcement, the service insisted that the depleted
uranium would pose no threat to either the soldiers who operated
the tanks or to the production workers who built them because of
the manner in which the tanks would be fabricated.
   ``Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low level
of natural radiation, which is well within the acceptable range
established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,'' the Army said.
   ``You would have to sit on this tank for 75 hours straight in
order to get the same equivalent radiation as a single chest
X-ray,'' added Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.
   The Abrams is made for the Army by the General Dynamics Corp. at
two plants _ in Lima, Ohio, and Detroit _ employing roughly 5,000
production workers. The armor plates are being made at a secret
location and then shipped to the assembly lines, the Army said.
   Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusually
dense _ 2{ times more so than steel. The term ``depleted'' means
the uranium does not have sufficient energy to be used for
commercial purposes such as in power plants.
   Depleted uranium has long been used for a variety of civilian
and military applications, ranging from the production of canisters
for the transport of more highly radioactive materials to certain
types of ammunition.
   In the case of the M-1A1, the Army refused to say how much
uranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tank
body the armor with uranium would be located, or how it would
produce the new armor.
   The sources said, however, the new process involved ``weaving''
a thread mesh of uranium into the regular steel armor plating at
the time of casting. The process produces an incredibly strong
plate that adds ``an insignificant amount of weight,'' they said.
   ``It's not only the strength of the uranium but the way it's
worked into the steel,'' said one official. ``The process is still
highly classified and nobody's going to say more.
   ``But the experts say this plating can stop any known Soviet
anti-tank round, as well as any of their more advanced rounds in
development.''
   The Army, in its statement, said, ``This improvement culminates
several years of research and development to meet recent and
continuing improvements in Warsaw Pact anti-armor weapons and will
allow the Abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the
1990s.''
   The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they will
not be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But the
remaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate the
new armor.
   ``The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in Europe
where they can most directly contribute to NATO defenses,'' the
service said. The first should arrive ``late this year.''
   Soucy said the new armor plating would begin showing up on the
tank manufacturing lines early this summer. The first completed
tank with the new armor will be delivered in October, the spokesman
added.
   Soucy declined to say how much the new armor would cost. Each
M-1A1 currently costs about $2.36 million.

<HEAD>Political Ads Leading Up To Today's Illinois Contest Far Less
Harsh</HEAD>

   George Bush, Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore
took relatively gentle pokes at their presidential rivals in
today's Illinois primary with television commercials that bore none
of the ferocity of the Super Tuesday media assault.
   The three were the only candidates to wage substantial media
campaigns in Illinois. Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Tennessee
Sen. Gore, both Democrats, were spending in the $250,000 range
while Republican Vice President Bush reported a $400,000
advertising buy.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., started running ads last Monday but cut
them off in a pre-weekend strategy shift and had nothing on the air
in the final days before the primary. Instead he bought a half-hour
of time Saturday night, but his broadcast was beset by technical
problems.
   Democrat Richard Gephardt was bypassing Illinois to focus on
Michigan's March 26 caucuses. And neither of the favorite sons,
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson,
were advertising in their home state.
   Front-runner Bush was running two ads he has used before _ one a
biographical spot and the other showing him with world leaders and
President Reagan. The latter says there is a difference between
congressional and presidential leadership _ the closest Bush gets
to criticizing Dole.
   Gore was on the air with several ads including a new one in
which he stresses his youth and service in Vietnam. ``There's only
one choice for a new generation of leadership,'' says the narrator,
echoing Gore's frequent contention that Dukakis can't get elected
because he represents ``the old politics.''
   For his part, Dukakis is taking a poke at Simon's insistence
that the Democratic race is wide open and ripe for a brokered
convention.
   The ad never mentions Simon, however. It merely says ``some
people'' would like to go back to the days of brokered conventions
``when voters didn't really pick their nominee. ... But you don't
have to do this. On Tuesday, you can pick the next president'' by
voting for Dukakis.
   The low-key tone adopted by all three candidates was a dramatic
change from the ads leading up to last week's Super Tuesday
contests in 20 states. At that time, Bush, Dole, Gephardt, Dukakis
and Gore specifically attacked each other's records, character and
campaign themes in barbed commercials that didn't hesitate to name
names.
   Dukakis held the lead in Democratic delegates going into
Illinois and was making some late progress toward the upper tier of
the contest, where polls showed Simon and Jackson neck and neck.
   In addition to his brokered convention spot, Dukakis was using
two ads he had run in Super Tuesday states _ one stressing his
experience as a chief executive and another in which a union
official says Dukakis is not a ``shot-and-beer kinda guy'' but his
economic policies put people to work.
   Gore also was running two other ads he had used for Super
Tuesday, when he won six states. One spot chides U.S. companies for
investing in jobs overseas rather than at home and the other says
big chemical polluters, price fixers, corporate law breakers and
greedy drug manufacturers ``don't want Al Gore to be president''
because he's fought them in the past.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Moves To Head Off Convention Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk wants to head
off a bruising battle for the party's presidential nomination and
would mediate efforts to close ranks behind a probable nominee if
nobody finishes the primaries with enough delegates to win.
   ``When you get to a point when there is someone who is somewhat
shy of a mathematical majority, I think the opportunity exists to
try to strengthen that person and not weaken him as you come into
the convention,'' Kirk said Monday.
   The delegates who could tip the balance for such a candidate are
the 645 so-called ``super delegates,'' the party leaders, members
of Congress and governors of states and territories who
automatically will be convention delegates because of the offices
they hold. Four years ago, 568 convention seats were used for this
purpose.
   ``When we increased those numbers, it was not tokenism,'' Kirk
said. ``Their status is that they have to run with and govern with
the ticket in the end.''
   Kirk, in a telephone interview from New York, said the super
delegates have a ``special responsibility'' to help ensure that the
Democratic presidential nomination does not wind up in a political
fight that damages the nominee.
   By the time the primaries and caucuses end in June, Kirk said he
believed that one candidate will be considered a clear front-runner
and the eventual nominee. That candidate will have developed a
consistent record of winning primaries and caucuses, even if he
does not have the delegates needed for a first-ballot victory at
the national convention, Kirk said.
   At that point, Kirk said he would meet with the candidates and
``say, `OK, here's where we are and here's where we have to be in
November. Now, what do we have to do to maximize those
opportunities?'''
   ``I don't want to leave the impression that Kirk's going to be
the broker,'' the party chairman said in a telephone interview from
New York. ``I'm not going to dictate to anyone because it doesn't
work that way.''
   However, he said he would be ``in the middle'' of efforts to
avoid harm that could be done to a probable nominee if a political
battle erupted just before or during the convention.
   The Democrats conclude their delegate selection on June 7 with
primaries in California and New Jersey, which combined account for
more than 400 national convention delegates.
   ``The whole thing is to avoid that brokering process taking
place in Atlanta,'' said Julie Anbender, a spokeswoman for Kirk.
``I think that he's been floating this idea with elected officials
and party officials for some time.''
   The Democratic National Convention is July 18-21 in Atlanta.
   The suggestion that the Democratic presidential nomination would
have to be brokered came after a clear front-runner failed to
emerge in contests to date. The party has already picked more than
40 percent of its national convention delegates.
   ``I don't discount the possibility that there will be a
first-ballot mathematical majority after you get through with
California,'' Kirk said. ``I think that is still likely.''
   Winning the presidential nomination takes at least 2,082
delegates, and so far no candidate has even one-fourth of that
number.
   The super delegates, some of whom cast just fractions of votes
under party rules, are not required to pledge their allegiance to
any presidential candidate before the convention, although some of
them have.
   Of the super delegates, 240.65 say they remain uncommitted,
while another 115.35 have come out in support of one candidate or
another. The remainder either have not responded to inquiries or
have not yet been selected.
   In the latter category are 253 members of Congress, who are to
be picked at party caucuses April 19-20, when Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt hopes to get a significant boost for his sagging
presidential prospects.
   Gephardt holds the No. 4 leadership position in the House as
head of the Democratic Caucus.
   Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson declined to offer any opinion on
Kirk's statement, saying only that ``we have no problems with the
party chairman at all.''
   When asked whether the Gephardt campaign supported a proposal to
rally support behind whoever is the leader after June 7, Johnson
said the idea of some sort of brokering process in June was
``hypothetical.''
   The current leader in the Democratic presidential field is
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has 462.5 delegates,
followed by Jesse Jackson with 423.55 and Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore with 352.8.

<HEAD>Government Launching Trade-and-Aid Program to Boost Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's new trade-and-aid program to
help American farmers by sending emissaries to foreign countries is
almost ready for launching.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Monday that the
first trip will be this spring to Indonesia and the Philippines.
The exact dates have to be negotiated with the countries.
   The mission will include representatives from the departments of
Agriculture and State, and the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Three to six representatives of the private sector
also will be selected for the trips.
   ``During my recent trip to Asia, I discussed possible missions
with the leaders and key agricultural officials of both
countries,'' Lyng said. ``We agreed that these missions would not
only address the food needs of these countries, but would help
develop customers for U.S. agricultural exports as well.''
   The trips are required by the Agricultural Aid and Trade
Missions Act, passed by Congress late last year. It specified that
16 missions be conducted in 1988, with eight completed by June.
   By offering specially designed packages of U.S. trade and food
assistance, the goal of the program is to help the designated
countries develop and to become larger markets for American farmers.
   ``Private sector involvement will ensure more effective
identification of trade and investment opportunities for U.S.
exporters,'' Lyng said. ``The recipient countries will benefit from
the technology and managerial expertise that can best be
transferred by the private sector.''
   Lyng added: ``This exchange helps foster development in the
recipient countries, which in turn expands the long-term demand for
U.S. agricultural exports.''
   Orville L. Freeman, a former secretary of agriculture and now
head of the Agriculture Council of America, is an enthusiastic
supporter of the trade-and-aid law, calling it ``the most promising
agricultural legislation since the passage of Public Law 480 in
1954,'' the Food for Peace program.
   ``The bottom line is to use all existing resources to lay the
groundwork for expanded business with developing countries which
have the potential for explosive market growth,'' Freeman said
recently.
   As described by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, each
mission will:
   _Meet with appropriate foreign and U.S. officials in each
country to help in planning the extent to which U.S. trade and aid
can be used to meet the food and economic needs in that country.
   _Provide technical help and information on U.S. agricultural
commodities and the trade and aid program.
   _Help obtain firm commitments for food aid programs and
commodity sales.
   ``Within 60 days after completion of a mission, the
representatives must report to the president and the Congress on
their findings and recommendations,'' the agency said.
   Further, beginning in December 1989, the USDA and AID must
submit quarterly reports to Congress about the progress made on
each mission's recommendations.

   Turkey production is rising faster than
Agriculture Department economists had previously forecast.
   The number of turkey eggs in incubators on March 1 was estimated
at 32.1 million, up almost 4 percent from a year ago, the
Agriculture Department reported Monday.
   Moreover, 23.1 million new turkey poults were placed in flocks
last month, a 2 percent increase from placements a year earlier,
said the Agricultural Statistics Board.
   In an earlier report, the department's Economic Research Service
said turkey output climbed 18 percent in 1987 to a record level. By
the third quarter market prices had dropped below break-even
prices. However, prices climbed dramatically in November and
December, putting fourth-quarter returns close to the break-even
level.
   ``Because no two consecutive quarters had strong negative net
returns, producers probably did not get an intense signal to slow
growth,'' the agency said in the March issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine. ``Production is now forecast to rise 10 percent
in 1988, up from the earlier forecast of 6 percent.''
   Wholesale prices of hen turkeys weighing 8 pounds to 16 pounds
averaged about 61 cents per pound in the East, the report said.
Prices in the first and second quarters of 1988 are expected to be
in the range of 48 cents to 52 cents and then rise seasonally in
the third and fourth.
   For all of 1988, the wholesale price may average 50 cents to 56
cents per pound, compared with 57.8 cents in 1987, the report said.

   A larger 1987 harvest and a bigger inventory
have put pressure on potato prices this season, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Total output last year rebounded almost 7 percent to an
estimated 385.7 million hundredweight, although still 3 percent shy
of the 1985 record, the department's Economic Research Service
said. Stocks of fresh potatoes on Jan. 1 were up 8 percent from a
year earlier.
   Idaho russets sold for $13.50 to $14 per hundredweight at the
end of January, compared with $17.50 to $19 the year before. Maine
round whites, at $5.80 to $6 per hundredweight, were down from
$8.10 to $8.50 a year earlier, the agency reported.
   Overall, the U.S. average grower price of potatoes in January
was $3.60 per hundredweight, down 25 percent from a year earlier.

   The U.S. Supreme Court early Tuesday refused
to halt the execution at dawn of convicted killer Willie Jasper
Darden, who survived an unprecedented six death warrants and became
an international cause celebre.
   Darden, who has maintained his innocence in the 1973 slaying of
a Lakeland businessman during a robbery, was scheduled to die in
the electric chair at 7 a.m. at Florida State Prison near this
North Florida town.
   The high court, in a 6-3 vote, denied a stay, as did a federal
appeals court in Atlanta, a federal judge in Tampa and Florida's
Supreme Court earlier in the day.
   ``I'm going to holler, I'm going to holler loud, and I'm not
going to stop hollering, and I'll be hollering, `Innocent,
innocent, innocent' if they put me in the chair,'' Darden said in
an interview taped earlier Monday and shown on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   ``If I had committed such a crime, I would have a guilty
conscience all these years. I could not have lived with it,'' he
said.
   His case has become focus of an international campaign against
capital punishment. Pope John Paul II and Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov had made appeals on his behalf.
   Darden's attorneys raised several claims on appeal, including
reports of new evidence and arguments that the 54-year-old Darden
had ineffective legal counsel.
   In Angola, La., meanwhile, Wayne R. Felde was put to death in
the electric chair early Tuesday for the 1978 slaying of a rookie
policeman. The the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday had refused in a
7-2 vote to halt the execution.
   Felde had claimed his wartime service in the Vietnam War had
made him insane, and pleaded with the jury to impose the death
penalty to keep him from killing again. He later withdrew the
request and fought his execution.
   Darden's appeals already had gone to the U.S. Supreme Court four
times. The last was rejected March 7 and Gov. Bob Martinez signed
Darden's seventh death warrant the next day.
   Martinez on Monday dismissed suggestions he was rushing the
execution.
   ``It's been 15 years,'' Martinez said. ``I think of the victim
at a moment like this and the family which was destroyed. A hideous
murder took place and that's what I keep in mind. Just because it's
15 years later, that doesn't reduce a crime that was committed at
the time.''
   Darden was condemned for the shooting of James Turman, who
interrupted a man robbing his wife, Helen, of $15. Mrs. Turman
later identified Darden as the assailant.
   ``I think it was all very fair and Darden was the one who did
it,'' Mrs. Turman told Lakeland radio station WONN. ``I was in the
store alone with him for a long time before Jim came in and was
shot. ... His face is still impressed in the back of my memory. I
can't get it out.''
   A neighbor, Philip Arnold, also identified Darden during the
trial. Arnold, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing
the shooting and Mrs. Turman's cries and was shot three times.
   If executed, Darden will be the 18th man Florida has put to
death since May 1979. Those men died after three or fewer warrants.
   Death penalty opponents claim Darden was railroaded because he
is black, and that he is innocent of murder and has an alibi to
prove it. They claim there is evidence _ statements from a minister
and another person _ that Darden could not have committed the
murder.
   The signing of the warrant last week gave defense attorneys only
one week to prepare.
   ``A lot of people feel the primary reason for the seven-day
warrant was to limit Amnesty International's ability to have
sufficient time to mobilize a public opinion assault as they did
very effectively for the sixth warrant,'' said Larry Spalding,
chief of the Office of Capital Collateral Representative, a
state-funded office of defense attorneys for death row inmates.
   Several hundred phone calls and telegrams had been received at
the governor's office in Tallahassee, most in favor of clemency.
The Florida Conference on the Poor held a vigil in the Capitol
rotunda Monday to press for clemency.
   In Sweden, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the
U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, urging Florida to commute Darden's death
sentence.
   The protest was sponsored by the Swedish chapter of Amnesty
International, which charged in a statement that ``death sentences
in the United States are handed down with a great deal of
discrimination and with a racial slant.''
   ``Since January, I have received close to 2,000 letters from
around the world,'' Darden said in an interview with The New York
Times published Sunday in which he maintained his innocence.

   Prominent Israeli peace activists say American
Jews who refuse to criticize the occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip are hurting Israel.
   By remaining silent, the activists said, many American Jews have
signaled endorsement of the policies of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, thereby increasing the credibility of his views.
   Shamir arrived here Monday for talks with U.S. officials. The
peace activists planned a prayer vigil outside the White House when
Shamir meets with President Reagan on Wednesday.
   But the activists said the Americans Jews opposed to Shamir
should make their views known. Those expressions could help curb
the ``terrifying phenomenon'' in which Israeli voters are moving to
the right, said Yael Dayan, daughter of the late Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan.
   ``On the whole, American Jews are not behind Shamir's policy,''
said Mordechai Bar-On, a founder of the Israeli group, Peace Now.
``They must speak out now.''
   Shamir, head of the Likud Party, is reluctant to cede to the
Palestinians land in the West Bank or Gaza, two areas seized by
Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967. His views are opposed by many
Labor Party officials in Jerusalem, who favor a more conciliatory
approach towards the Palestinians.
   Giora Furman, former deputy commander of the Israeli Air Force,
said it is unrealistic for Israel to hang on to the territories in
the face of the determined Palestinian uprising.
   The peace group wants Shamir to endorse the return of some land
to the Palestinians, which is part of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's Middle East peace proposal.
   ``I am very upset with what is happening to the American Jewish
community,'' Ms. Dayan said, adding it was ``rubbish'' for American
Jews to hold their tongues when Israel does something morally wrong.
   Ms. Dayan said Americans should write members of Congress and
Israeli leaders. But using U.S. aid as a lever to force change
could be counterproductive because the money _ about $1.5 billion
annually _ is spent on worthy causes, she said.
   Morris Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
Jewish Organizations, said the peace activists should be directing
its criticism at the Arab leaders who refuse to meet with Israeli
officials.
   ``The group is misdirected as to where its criticism is being
put,'' he said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says that
seven weeks of Senate testimony have produced nothing to bar the
speedy ratification of the new arms reduction treaty with the
Soviet Union.
   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Monday, Shultz angrily dismissed an allegation by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that the administration's public defense of the pact is
based on ``misrepresentation'' and is at odds with facts presented
in closed-door secret sessions.
   Shultz also said the Senate should firmly discard all proposed
amendments or reservations to the treaty, including one that would
tie its implementation to reversing Soviet superiority in
conventional arms in Europe.
   He ticked off objections that have been mounted to the terms of
the pact, which bans medium-range nuclear missiles, and asserted
that all those objections have been refuted.
   The secretary of state, whose testimony opened the committee's
examination of the treaty in January, commented as he made a return
appearance to offer a summing up.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate's deputy majority
leader and a respected vote counter, predicted that the pact will
be ratified by the full Senate by a margin far greater than the
required two-thirds majority.
   Cranston said the Senate will act well in advance of a planned
Moscow summit meeting this spring between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We believe the treaty stands on its merits,'' Shultz said.
``It is self-contained and should not be made a vehicle for
statements on other issues,'' including the Soviet military
occupation of Afghanistan.
   But he bristled after hearing Helms declare that there is ``a
wide gap between the administration's public representations about
the treaty and the information which we have received in closed
session.''
   ``Indeed,'' Helms said, ``after many hours of listening to
testimony both private and public, the administration's public
presentation of the treaty has been a tissue of confusion,
misstatements and _ and I use the word advisedly _ even
misrepresentations.''
   Shultz told Helms: ``In a sense I don't know what I'm doing
here. Are you sitting here accusing me of deliberately
misrepresenting? ... I can handle it fine when people say they
don't agree with me, but when they say I have misrepresented, I
have trouble with that.''
   Helms said he was not accusing Shultz of ``deliberately''
misrepresenting, but he added that ``the contradictions are
self-apparent.''
   Replying to questions, Shultz told Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.,
that Senate passage of an amendment delaying implementation of the
treaty until the West achieved a balance with the Soviet Union in
conventional arms would kill the pact.
   The pact, formally termed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
or INF treaty, calls for the destruction of all nuclear missiles
with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   Shultz said he does not believe the treaty will cause West
Germany to demand the removal of all nuclear weapons from its soil
_ a step that some fear could open Europe to intimidation by the
Soviet Union, which is said to have superiority in conventional,
non-nuclear forces.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction, with six-month bills
dropping to the lowest level since last July.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.5 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.65 percent on Monday, down from
5.74 percent last week. An additional $6.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.78 percent, down
from 5.93 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 5.62
percent on Feb. 29 and six-month bills averaged 5.54 percent on
July 13, 1987.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.81 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,857.20 and 6.04 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,707.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 6.72 percent last week
from 6.63 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Teamsters Say Machinists, Pilots Would Back Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union has set a new March 29
target for its 6,700 member flight attendants to strike Northwest
Airlines armed with a pledge that mechanics and baggage handlers
will honor picket lines.
   ``Anyone who is thinking of flying Northwest during the Easter
holidays should forget it,'' William Genoese, director of the
union's airline division, told reporters Monday after announcing
the strike deadline.
   Northwest officials expressed immediate skepticism that the
union will carry out its threat, but said the airline has
management workers and replacement attendants in training to keep
the airline operating if it does.
   ``The Teamsters have set many deadlines ... and flight
attendants continue to work,'' said Bob Gibbons, a Northwest
spokesman. ``We'll just have to see if this deadline has any more
validity than others the union has announced.''
   Genoese met several hours at Teamster headquarters here with Guy
Cook, president of the Machinists Union's District 143 in
Minneapolis, which represents Northwest's 20,000 mechanics and
baggage handlers.
   ``I have no doubt that the membership I represent will honor any
work stoppage,'' said Cook ``We've got our own problems in
negotiations with Northwest. If they want a war, they probably are
going to get one.''
   The Teamsters earlier had threatened to strike Northwest the
last weekend of February, when a 30-day cooling-off period ordered
by the National Mediation Board expired.
   Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., has announced it will
unilaterally impose a new policy manual on April 1 replacing the
old flight attendants' contract and stretching out from five years
to eight years the time required for a newly hired attendant to
reach top scale.
   Absent from Monday's meeting were representatives of the Air
Line Pilots Association, which represents 2,300 Northwest pilots.
   ``The pilots have told us that when the time comes, they will do
the right thing,'' Genoese said.
   Leaders of ALPA's Northwest locals could not be reached for
comment. But John Mazor, a spokeman at the pilot union's
headquarters here, said its policy is to ``not announce any
decision on whether to support a strike by another union unless or
until a strike occurs and a picket line goes up.''
   Under the National Railway Labor Act governing labor relations
in the rail and airline industries, courts have frequently ordered
members of unions not on strike themselves but honoring another
union's picket line to return to work.
   Terms of a two-tier, A and B, wage system at Northwest under
which new hires reach the pay level of veterans have been the major
stumbling block in the bargaining talks between the airline and the
Teamsters.
   The union originally proposed eliminating the lower B scale
entirely but had agreed to stretch it to six years before the talks
broke off.
   Northwest's last contract proposal included raising base pay for
beginning flight attendants on the B scale would climb from $13,000
to $15,000 over a five-year period. Base pay for full-time veterans
on the top A scale would rise from $32,000 to $35,000 under the
same offer.

<HEAD>Erase Gephardt Trade Plan, Senators Urge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are starting to push their House
counterparts in earnest to erase the trade plan that serves as the
centerpiece of Democrat Richard A. Gephardt's race for the
presidential nomination.
   ``We decided to stick with our own Super 301 plan and to oppose
the Gephardt amendment,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Monday
after a meeting of Senate conferees on the trade issue.
   As part of the action, the Senate will ask the House to drop the
Gephardt plan from the final version of sweeping trade legislation
passed by both houses last year.
   The decision was made by Senate members of a House-Senate
conference committee seeking a compromise version of the rival
1,000-page trade bills. It came on a voice vote in a closed-door
session of the Senate conferees.
   The move represents step one in a compromise process involving
proposals that go back and forth between the House and Senate until
both chambers agree on one version.
   Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson said the Senate's action
represented ``nothing new'' in the trade debate.
   ``It's merely an opening bargaining position,'' he said. ``We're
confident that whatever emerges from conference will be new,
forceful legislation to open foreign markets. And clearly the
Gephardt amendment paved the way.''
   Gephardt's plan calls for negotiations to reduce Japan's and
other nations' ``excess and unwarranted'' trade surpluses with the
United States.
   If those talks failed, the plan would prescribe presidential
action to cut the surpluses by 10 percent a year. Such action could
include tariffs or import quotas on Japanese goods brought into the
United States.
   The president could, however, take no action if there are
considerations of ``national economic security'' or if the other
country had a serious international debt problem.
   Gephardt's amendment has been the chief basis of his appeal to
blue-collar workers and others concerned over the impact on
American jobs of products imported from Japan and newly
industrialized nations in East Asia.
   The ``Super 301'' provision that the Senate is pushing would
require the president to act to eliminate all of the unfair foreign
trade practices listed on an inventory to be drawn up by the U.S.
Trade Representative. It is named for the section of the Trade Act
that deals with retaliatory steps against such unfair practices.
   Before sending their offer to the House, the senators planned to
return to the table today and fashion additional provisions
involving steps to combat ``dumping,'' or selling foreign-made
products in world markets at prices lower than those in home
markets.
   The senators also intend to work on provisions involving
``countervailing duties,'' or tariffs that are imposed to offset
the price advantage that some foreign-made products get from export
subsidies in their home countries.
   On Monday, the senators moved to expand from seven months to 12
months the time for the president to make a determination as to
whether a foreign trade practice should be considered unfair.

   Wayne Robert Felde, who had pleaded with a
jury to impose the death penalty to keep him from killing again,
was executed in the electric chair early Tuesday for the 1978
slaying of a rookie policeman.
   Felde, 38, went to his death at 12:14 a.m. after the U.S.
Supreme Court late Monday refused in a 7-2 vote to stay the
execution.
   ``You can kill the messenger but you can't kill the message,''
he said in his final statement. ``Sooner or later, you have to
acknowledge it for what it means, not for what you want it to
mean.''
   He gave no indication what he referred to, but paused so that
witnesses could write it down.
   Felde was convicted of shooting a policeman in the back in
Shreveport while being taken to jail in handcuffs for drunkenness.
An Army veteran of Vietnam, Felde had claimed at trial that his
wartime experience had made him insane.
   The execution occurred less than a day after Gov. Buddy Roemer
was inaugurated. Felde's lawyers had planned to ask the governor to
stop the execution until a new pardon board could consider the case.
   Roemer had said earlier he would not intervene.
   In Starke, Fla., meanwhile, Willie Jasper Darden, who survived
an unprecedented six death warrants and became an international
cause celebre, awaited execution in the electric chair early
Tuesday for the 1973 slaying of a businessman during a robbery.
   The last time there was more than one execution in one day in
this country was Aug. 28, when murderers were put to death in
Alabama, Florida and Utah.
   Felde was the first person in Louisiana to use his Vietnam
service as the basis for a criminal insanity plea.
   He said finding Viet Cong tunnels and being exposed to the
chemical Agent Orange left him subject to flashbacks and unable to
tell right from wrong when he pulled a gun hidden in his pants and
shot Officer Glen Thomkins while being taken to jail in handcuffs.
   In 1980, a jury convicted him of first-degree murder, which
carries life in prison or death in the electric chair. Felde asked
for the death penalty, ``or other deaths will result.''
   ``It's happened twice in eight years. There's been 10 years of
proof shown to you,'' he told the jury. Felde at the time of the
slaying was a fugitive from a work release program in Maryland,
where he had been convicted of manslaughter.
   Felde withdrew his request after the trial, and his appeal to
the Supreme Court was based in part on his claim that he was denied
competent representation because his attorney at trial joined him
in asking for the death sentence.
   Felde appeared unsuccessfully before the pardon board appointed
by Roemer's predecessor, Gov. Edwin Edwards, two weeks ago.
   Bill Quigley, one of Felde's lawyers, argued that the old board
was tainted by a pardon-selling scandal that sent the board
chairman to jail. He said Roemer should refer the case to the new
board he appoints.
   Ninety-four people have been executed in the United States,
including 15 in Louisiana, since the death penalty was revived
following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 1970s.
   The most recent occurred Jan. 7 when Robert Streetman was
executed by injection in Texas for murdering a woman in 1982. The
most recent execution in Louisiana was Aug. 24.

<HEAD>Biden Doctors Discuss Treatment Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden's doctors are discussing
treatment to prevent more blood clots like the one just discovered
in one of the senator's lungs.
   Peter Esker, a spokesman at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
said Monday that the clot in the lung was dissolving, but treatment
would likely be needed to prevent further clots.
   Doctors could use anti-coagulant drugs or a surgical procedure,
Esker said.
   Biden, 45, was admitted to the hospital Sunday. He underwent an
operation at Walter Reed on Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm _ the
ballooning of an artery wall _ in an artery supplying blood to the
brain.
   Biden was recovering at home from that operation and waiting for
an operation on a second aneurysm when he had to re-enter the
hospital.
   ``Medical tests show that the senator did experience a pulmonary
embolism, or a blood clot, that lodged in one of his lungs,'' Esker
said.
   ``The clot, which could have resulted from decreased activity
following major surgery, did no damage. Medical tests are
continuing to determine the method of lessening the chances of
other clots developing,'' he said.
   Esker said the alternative to anti-coagulant drugs is to insert
a venous filter, a form of catheter, in a vein.

   Students at the nation's only liberal arts
college for the deaf greeted the week with jubilation, as they were
formally introduced to the first deaf president and first deaf
board chairman in Gallaudet University's history.
   Irving King Jordan Jr. and Philip W. Bravin received standing
ovations Monday from the same students who effectively shut down
the 124-year-old institution over appointment of a woman with
normal hearing to be president.
   ``People will look at us and study what we are doing,'' said
Jordan, a 44-year-old professor and dean of the college of arts and
sciences at Gallaudet. ``We will prove to them, not only can they
choose a deaf president and chairman, but that these two will
succeed.''
   The two officials were joined at a news conference by student
body president Greg Hlibok, one of the campus leaders in the week
of protest over the hiring of Elisabeth Ann Zinser as president.
   The students succeeded in pressuring Zinser to resign last
Friday, less than a week after her appointment and in winning the
subsequent resignation of board chairman Jane Bassett Spilman, who
can hear.
   ``We're back in business and back to business, but Gallaudet
will never again be what it used to be,'' said Hlibok, who spoke in
sign language and through an interpreter.
   Only a few students were on campus Monday, the first day of a
spring break, but many people filled the auditorium for the press
conference and wore their ``Deaf President Now'' buttons.
   Jordan had endorsed Zinser's presidency last week but then
retracted it.
   Jordan lost his hearing at age 20 in a motorcycle accident. He
speaks clearly, but also uses sign language when he talks.
   ``We are continually impressed with him and we will give him our
full support,'' said Jerry Covell, a leader of the protest.
   Jordan received his bachelor's degree in psychology at
Gallaudet, then obtained his master's and doctorate at the
University of Tennessee.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic church leaders, who
have called on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down, offered to
mediate talks between the military strongman and opposition
political groups demanding his ouster.
   But church officials also said on Monday that it may be
difficult ``to build a silver bridge for (Noriega) to leave,'' now
that the United States has indicted Noriega on drug trafficking and
money laundering charges.
   Since then, the country has fallen into a deepening financial
crisis that occurred after the United States imposed several new
economic sanctions on Panama, including the withholding of $6.5
million in Panama Canal fees due this week. It earlier cut off all
economic and military aid to the country.
   The 118 local and foreign banks that do business in Panama
remained closed Monday by government order for the 20th straight
day.
   ``The church still hopes to act as a bridge. There is no
question that Noriega must go ... The problem is how he goes,'' the
Rev. Fernando Guardia, a top church spokesman and vicar of the
archdiocese, said Monday.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath, a native of Philadelphia, has been
criticial of the government in the past, but always avoided direct
confrontation to protect his priests, nearly 75 percent of whom are
foreigners.
   Under Panamanian law, they must have their visas renewed every
three months by immigration authorities, which come under Noriega's
Defense Forces.
   Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and the nation's de facto
ruler, ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26 after
Delvalle tried to fire Noriega.
   ``We are under pressure,'' said Father Guardia, a Panamanian,
explaining that foreign priests who tried to speak out in the past
were often threatened and reminded that they can lose their visas.
``They have not expelled any of our priests, but they have us by
the neck.''
   The country's bishops, in a statements that mentioned no names,
have accused the military regime of being responsible for Panama's
crisis.
   The bishops urged ``strict observance of constitutional norms,
full and effective subordination of the military to civil
authority,'' the creation of conditions for free elections, ``the
restoration of civil liberties and human rights,'' and asked that
``news media be allowed to reopen.''
   The bishops also lashed out at the military for resorting ``to
false nationalism'' to whip up support for the Noriega government,
but called for a ``Panamanian solution to the crisis without
foreign intervention.''
   The bishops also offered on Monday to act as a ``liaison'' to
seek a solution to the crisis, but there was no answer from the
government. Official government media accused the Church of siding
with the oppostion.
   ``People were fed up with Noriega since last year,'' Father
Guardia said, ``but the indictment by the United States was
politically mishandled. The government party and other groups here
threw their support to Noriega and Noriega will hang in there
longer and eventually drag others with him.''
   ``They (the United States) closed all avenues,'' Father Guardia
added. ``It is very difficult for Noriega now to go somewhere with
the indictment hanging over his head. But he has to realize that he
msut go.
   About 80 percent of the people of Panama are Roman Catholic.

   The Senate, struggling to make legislating a
more orderly affair, put itself on a new work schedule this year
and tightened up its procedures.
   The change produced unintended consequences.
   Under the new schedule the Senate works in Washington for three
straight weeks, then permits senators to return to their home
states for a full week to attend to their constituents.
   The purpose of the change was to disband the so-called
Tuesday-Thursday club, named for the age-old practice of many
senators who left Washington on Thursday evenings and did not
return until the following Tuesdays.
   Now when the Senate is meeting senators are expected to attend,
Monday through Friday, no exceptions.
   There have been other changes as well.
   Roll call votes, which often were prolonged for an hour or more
while the Senate waited for an absent member to arrive from the
airport or from a meeting across town, were limited to a strict 15
minutes each, no exceptions.
   And that caused the problem.
   The three Senate office buildings are linked to the Capitol by
an underground subway.
   For years that subway has routinely and efficiently served two
of those buildings _ the Russell and the Dirksen.
   But the tunnel which was extended to the new Hart Senate Office
Building is far longer, as is the trip to the Capitol.
   And the Hart Building contains the offices of 50 of the 100
senators.
   Last month, seven or eight senators hurried to the Hart subway
station with only minutes to spare to make a roll call.
   But the car was jammed with visitors.
   ``There were unusual circumstances,'' Sen. Howell Heflin,
D-Ala., told his colleagues.
   ``There were some blind people on the subway car and it took
some time to get them off.''
   The 15-minute clock ticked to an end and Heflin and his
colleagues missed the vote.
   They demanded a solution to their transportation problem and a
solution was provided.
   Tourists and other visitors were banned from the cars during
roll call votes.
   And a subway car will now depart the Hart subway station
precisely three minutes before the end of a 15-minute vote, giving
senators just enough time to reach the Senate chamber and cast
their votes.
   The Senate and its subway cars roll on.

   Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., was on the House floor earlier this
month, holding forth with some heat on the turn of events that had
seen Congress cut off all aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``Mr. Speaker, if I have told you once I have told you a hundred
times that every time you cozy up to those communists down there in
Nicaragua they are going to stick a rusty knife right in your
back,'' he fumed, adding that he was off to California and would
return ``with more facts and figures'' from a RAND Corp. report on
communist activity south of the border.
   He said he would seek permission to publish all of it in the
Congressional Record.
   ``And I do not care if it costs thousands of dollars, and it
will,'' Dornan said in a shout.
   ``I want that whole report in the record, available to all the
schools and libraries across America and everybody who follows the
proceedings in this House through the written record and national
technical means _ that means electronic.''
   Dornan stopped.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., took the floor.
   He had a question.
   ``I simply wanted to ask the gentleman from California if any of
us could help get him a sedative?'' Obey said.
   When the one-line comment appeared in the Congressional Record
it bore a five-word headline.
   The headline: ``A Sedative For A Member.''

<HEAD>Boy Recovers From Coma, Wins Spelling Bee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUMNER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shane Nicolich's watch stopped at 2:53 p.m.
on the day he tumbled 40 feet from a tree behind his home. And for
more than a year, so did his life. Doctors and family feared he
would never recover from a coma.
   Last month, the 12-year-old won the Sumner School District
spelling bee _ by spelling the word ``hypodermic.''
   ``I knew I had that one,'' Shane said, grinning.
   Shane, the older of two sons of Mike and Donna Nicolich, is now
a lanky seventh-grader with only traces of the injury doctors said
would leave him comatose the rest of his life.
   His walk is almost back to normal and he only occasionally
responds slowly to questions. His brain stem has healed and he has
regained use of the left side of his body.
   In February, he completed a cross-country skiing course and was
readmitted to his junior high school's gifted program.
   ``My verbal IQ is back up to 124,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``That's 24 points away from Einstein. Write that down.''
   He doesn't remember much, however, about the July 14, 1986,
accident at his home in Sumner, about 10 miles east of Tacoma.
   ``I was in this humongous tree playing with a bunch of friends.
It seems I either got dizzy or a branch broke,'' he said.
   For the next two months, the comatose boy was treated at Good
Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, the trauma unit at St. Joseph
Hospital in Tacoma and finally Orchard Park Health Care Center in
Tacoma.
   He remembers nothing about the coma except for one thought days
before he woke up: ``I was dreaming about stuff like being home and
eating spaghetti and French bread.''
   He came home the day before Halloween, and immediately began
therapy at Good Samaritan. He still attends sessions three times a
week, and doctors expect the sessions to continue for two or three
more years.
   ``Given the severity of his injuries, he's a real miracle,''
said Dr. Tom Wyckoff of Puyallup. ``He has tremendous spirit and
he'll go far. We're looking beyond high school to college.''
   Wyckoff, who specializes in rehabilitation medicine, said Monday
Shane's success is due to his youth, his family and his
intelligence.
   His rapid recovery was used as an example at a recent National
Head Injury Foundation conference in Seattle.
   Although Shane can ride his bike and cross-country ski, he still
can't be left unattended, Wyckoff said, because his agility and
sense of judgment are slightly impaired. He wears a helmet on his
bike because doctors fear another head injury could send him into
another coma.
   Mrs. Nicolich, a housewife whose husband is a construction
worker, said she's amazed at Shane's recovery.
   ``Mike and I have done the best we can, but if it wasn't for
Shane striving so hard, it wouldn't have happened,'' she said. ``I
told him if I could give him a Purple Heart for his courage, I
would.''
   Shane is also aware of the changes.
   ``I guess I'm special,'' he said. ``I was a regular `brainiac'
before the accident. I used to get straight A's. Now I have a B
minus. I'm pretty amazed I made the spelling bee even though I won
a lot of them before.
   ``I just want to be treated like a regular Joe Schmo, really,''
he added. ``Some of my friends tease me and tell me I have brain
damage, but they stick up for me.''

<HEAD>Revised Medicaid Rules Shift Costs to Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 50 percent of the low-income elderly
people would have to pay an extra $50 to $75 a month for their
Medicaid-funded nursing home care under new regulations that take
effect next month.
   The new regulations are meant to enable states to ``shift more
of the financial responsibility for the cost of nursing home care
to the recipient,'' the Department of Health and Human Services
said in a notice published Feb. 8 in the Federal Register. The
regulations are scheduled to take effect April 8.
   From 20 percent to 50 percent of institutionalized Medicaid
recipients would be affected, the department said. Savings to the
state and federal government would total $160 million to $615
million from 1987 to 1989.
   Medicaid recipients pay a certain percentage of their income for
nursing home care after deducting medical costs not covered by
their state Medicaid plan _ for example, eyeglasses or hearing aids.
   Under the new rule, states will be allowed to eliminate or
curtail these deductions for the first time.
   HHS said states most likely will restrict income deductions for
services they believe have marginal or questionable therapeutic
value.
   ``It appears highly likely that the major impact of this
regulation will fall on providers of non-institutional services
such as physicians, dentists, and physical and occupational
therapists,'' the department said.

   Four men expected to be key prosecution
witnesses at the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi tried to
offer a $200,000 bribe to Attorney General Edwin Meese III through
a middleman, Biaggi's lawyer claims.
   The four ex-Wedtech Corp. officials ``corrupted an entire
administration _ this administration,'' Biaggi lawyer James LaRossa
said in his opening statement to the jury Monday.
   A Justice Department official denied the bribe allegation as
``preposterous.''
   Attorneys for Biaggi, D-N.Y., and his six co-defendants
completed their opening remarks, paving the way for the first
witness to take the stand today in U.S. District Court.
   The four _ Wedtech co-founder Fred Neuberger, former vice
chairman Mario Moreno, ex-president Anthony Guariglia and former
executive vice president Lawrence Shorten _ have pleaded guilty to
state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
in return for leniency. They have yet to be sentenced.
   Before their plea bargain was struck, LaRossa said, they offered
a bribe to E. Robert Wallach, a close friend of Meese and a key
figure in an investigation of a proposed $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.
   LaRossa said the Wedtech officials told Wallach: ``We'll give
you $200,000 for your friend Ed Meese. Get to Meese. Get us foreign
asylum.''
   At a second meeting, LaRossa said, the same money was offered to
Wallach, who was told: ``Get us an assurance that we won't go to
jail.'' LaRossa said Wallach gave them that assurance.
   ``So the people who are going to take the stand here and testify
... they were trying to buy the attorney general of the United
States,'' LaRossa charged.
   He appeared to indicate that the money was never paid.
   In Washington, one of Meese's attorneys, Nathan Lewin, said he
had spoken with Meese about LaRossa's remarks.
   ``There was never any request that he (Meese) get involved in
the Wedtech investigation in any way. He never did. He never would
have contemplated doing that. It's preposterous to think that
there's any scintilla of truth to that account,'' Lewin said.
   LaRossa said the four ``lied, stole, plundered and raped'' the
company, a Bronx defense contractor now in bankruptcy proceedings.
   They created a $14 million slush fund, from which they stole $5
million and ``the rest of the money was used to pay off people in
Washington, union people'' and others, LaRossa said. ``Not one
penny went to Mario Biaggi.''
   Biaggi, 70, the city's senior congressman; his eldest son; the
elder Biaggi's law partner and four others are charged with
racketeering for allegedly demanding millions of dollars in bribes
to help the company win government contracts.
   LaRossa claimed the no-bid contracts that transformed Wedtech
from a small machine shop into a $100 million-a-year defense
contractor were awarded through White House influence.
   He said Meese, then President Reagan's chief of staff, passed
the word to officials of the Navy, Army and Small Business
Administration that ``the president wants these contracts to go to
Wedtech.''
   Former White House aide Lyn Nofziger was convicted last month of
illegal lobbying for Wedtech soon after he left the Reagan
administration.
   A special prosecutor in Washington said in December that there
was insufficient evidence to charge Meese with any wrongdoing in
the Wedtech scandal. The investigation is continuing.
   The prosecutor also is investigating Meese's role in the
pipeline as a result of a memo written to Meese by Wallach
mentioning planned payments to the Israeli Labor Party in a bid to
protect the project in Iraq from Israeli attack.

   A 60-Marine security force and a 44-man Air
Force military police unit have been sent to Panama to help
safeguard American personnel and facilities in that Central
American nation, the Pentagon says.
   ``This is simply a prudent measure to augment the security
personnel who are already in place,'' Cmdr. Robert Prucha, a
Pentagon spokesman, said Monday, the day the additional personnel
were shipped out.
   The Marine group includes a six-man dog handling team. The
Marines left from Norfolk, Va., and the Air Force group from Shaw
Air Force Base in South Carolina.
   There are currently about 600 servicemen assigned to security
duties in Panama with the U.S. Southern Command, which is
headquartered there, Prucha said.
   All told, there are about 10,000 American troops in Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been using financial pressure in a
bid to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega ``and we
don't want to be caught unprepared if he responds by trying to
sabotage canal equipment or other facilities,'' said one official.
   Sources said the Marine unit was ``a fleet anti-terrorist
security team'' that could be used to keep watch on the Panama
Canal, an oil pipeline that carries Alaskan oil across Panama, and
the U.S. Embassy.
   The Air Force unit, a so-called ``air base ground defense
flight,'' is trained in maintaining security around the perimeters
of military bases, the officials said.
   While there is no evidence of sabotage and no reason at this
point to anticipate an attack on U.S. facilities by Panamanians,
``there have been a number of bomb scares recently,'' said one
official.
   ``We don't want to overreact, but we don't want to get caught
flat-footed, either,'' said another source.
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Monday there
had been no change in the alert status for U.S. personnel in Panama
and that the lowest form of alert _ ``Alpha'' _ was still in place.
   ``We are not sending in combat troops,'' the spokeswoman
stressed. ``These are police and security units.''

   A Vietnam veteran who said his years of
bloody combat left him unable to tell right from wrong went to his
death early today for shooting a rookie policeman in the back three
times.
   ``You can kill the messenger but you can't kill the message,''
Wayne Robert Felde, 38, said in a cryptic, two-sentence final
statement. ``Sooner or later, you have to acknowledge it for what
it means, not for what you want it to mean.''
   As Felde died, three policemen from Shreveport stood in the cold
at the prison gate with a group of five other supporters of
``victims' rights,'' including some relatives of murder victims.
   ``Justice is being done tonight. I hate it took 10 years,'' said
Sgt. Glenn Ramsey, a friend of Felde's murder victim, Shreveport
Officer Glen Tompkins.
   The execution, Louisiana's 16th since it resumed capital
punishment in 1983 and one of two scheduled for today, came after
Felde's lawyers failed on two fronts to win last-minute
postponements. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 late Monday to let
the execution proceed. Gov. Buddy Roemer, who was inaugurated
earlier in the day, also did not stop it.
   Bill Quigley, one of Felde's lawyers, said he thought Roemer
would postpone the execution until he could appoint a new pardon
board to consider the case.
   The outgoing pardon board rejected Felde's appeal less than two
weeks ago. Quigley argued that Roemer should not stand on that
ruling since it came from a board scarred earlier by a
pardon-selling scandal that sent the board chairman to jail.
   Warden Hilton Butler said Felde told him as the hour grew near
that he did not want the execution called off.
   It was a return to the stance Felde took at his trial, when the
jury found him guilty and he told them to execute him to prevent
more killing.
   He already had been convicted in Maryland of manslaughter and
was in Shreveport because he had escaped from a work-release
program there.
   ``All I can advise you all is to give me the death penalty in
this case .... or other deaths will result,'' he said, describing
himself as a walking time bomb.
   He changed his mind, however, and helped in his appeals as he
fought to stay alive, saying he was not mentally competent when he
told the jury he wanted to die.
   Felde was the first person in Louisiana to use Vietnam for a
criminal insanity plea. He had joined the Army at 18 and was sent
in 1967 to Vietnam where he was among the men who ferreted out Viet
Cong tunnels.
   He said it ruined him and he couldn't tell right from wrong when
he was arrested by Tompkins for drunkenness in 1979. Although
handcuffed and put in the back seat of the police car, Felde got a
gun out of his pants and shot Tompkins three times in the back.
   In Florida, Willie Jasper Darden, who survived an unprecedented
six death warrants and became an international cause celebre over
capital punishment, awaited execution early today for the 1973
slaying of a businessman during a robbery.
   The last time there was more than one execution in one day in
this country was Aug. 28, when murderers were put to death in
Alabama, Florida and Utah.

<HEAD>U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Pact To Help New England Economy, Study
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England's economy would prosper under the
U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, enjoying a more accessible
Canadian market and stabilized power imports that could entice new
companies to the region, says a business group study.
   George Macomber, chairman of the New England Council Inc., which
released the report Monday, said the study ``clearly demonstrates
that the (pact) would benefit the region and in the long term
improve New England's trade position with Canada.''
   The council, an association representing more than 1,000
businesses in the six states, supports the agreement, which was
signed Jan. 2 by President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. It still must win ratification by Congress and the
Canadian Parliament.
   Various industries in the Northwest and Midwest have expressed
concern about the pact, saying it does not do enough to eliminate
Canadian trade barriers. But many New England officials support the
agreement.
   The agreement would eliminate all tariffs between the two
countries by 1999 and would establish a new tribunal to settle
future trade disputes. The United States and Canada are the world's
two largest trading partners, with two-way trade of nearly $150
billion a year.

<HEAD>Handicapped People Protest DOT Transportation Policies</HEAD>

   Some handicapped protestors criticizing what
they said are federal policies that result in inadequate mass
transit services for disabled people have chained themselves to the
doors of the Department of Transportation headquarters and vow to
stay until officials agree to improve bus service for handicapped
people.
   Members of Americans Disabled For Accessible Transportation
(ADAPT) gathered from around the country Monday to protest the
department's decision to appeal a January ruling that transit
agencies must provide services to the handicapped regardless of
cost.
   In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz in Philadelphia
struck down a Transportation Department regulation requiring the
nation's transit authorities to spend no more than 3 percent of
their budgets on the disabled.
   The demonstrators timed their protest to coincide with a
three-day meeting of the American Public Transit Association, which
represents local agencies that provide bus and subway service.
   Timothy Cook, a Philadelphia attorney who represented ADAPT in
the lawsuit, said the present system of allowing transit agencies
to decide what services to provide to the handicapped ``gives
individual states the option to discriminate.''
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Monday the department
is ``fully committed to providing mass transportation to people
with disabilities.''

<HEAD>NOAA Issues $100,000 In Fines For Illegal Fishing In Bering Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration has levied fines totaling $100,000 against three
Japanese firms whose ships were videotaped apparently fishing
illegally in U.S. waters off Alaska in early January.
   The civil fines of $25,000 per vessel involved are the maximum
allowed under U.S. law.
   ``This underscores how seriously we viewed the violations,'' Jim
Brennan, a deputy general counsel for NOAA, said Monday. He said
the Japanese companies can seek an administrative hearing on the
fines if they decide to appeal.
   ``This action should send a powerful message to any fisherman
who is thinking about fishing illegally in our waters,'' said Rep.
Don Bonker, D-Wash.
   The fines were based on a review of the videotapes and
depositions taken from commercial fishermen who chartered a plane
and photographed the vessels with their nets down allegedly 38
miles inside the American fishing zone, said Brennan.
   Two of the vessels videotaped are owned and operated by Hamaya
Suisan Co., Ltd., which was fined a total of $50,000, said Brennan.
The other two vessels are owned and operated by Senkon Gyogyo Co.,
Ltd., and Taisei Gyogyo Co., Ltd., Those companies each were fined
$25,000.
   In addition, the owners and operators of two unidentified
fishing vessels that were also videotaped were fined a total of
$100,000. The identification numbers on the vessels were covered at
the time they were photographed.

   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo was
removed as mediator of the peace talks because he wanted the
Sandinistas to discuss political reforms as well as a cease-fire
with the Contras, sources said.
   President Daniel Ortega diplomatically eased Obando y Bravo from
his job as mediator on March 2, thanking him for his efforts but
saying the cardinal would not be needed for direct talks scheduled
for next week.
   The manuever effectively removed the Roman Catholic prelate from
pushing what were seen by the leftist Sandinista government as
pro-Contra proposals.
   Ortega has called for three days of face-to-face talks with the
Contras beginning Monday in the Nicaraguan post at Sapoa on the
border with Costa Rica.
   Ortega said his brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, the nation's top
military leader, would head the Sandinista delegation. The Contras
countered by naming Adolfo Calero, their highest political leader,
to head their delegation.
   Sandinista sources and opposition figures, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Ortega ousted Obando y Bravo because
he outlined a proposal that would force the government to discuss
internal politics with the rebels.
   The government has refused to discuss anything but a cease-fire.
   During the last round of talks on Feb. 18 in Guatemala, Obando y
Bravo called on the Sandinista government to grant total amnesty,
revise the military draft law, grant full press freedom and reopen
stalled talks with internal opposition parties. He also suggested a
30-day truce.
   The Contras quickly accepted the proposal. The Sandinistas
hesitated.
   Obando y Bravo, saying the two sides were at an impasse, broke
off the talks the following day.
   Ortega on Feb. 23 sent the cardinal an angry letter, decrying
the talks' ``abrupt suspension without consulation.'' The letter
was the first in a week of exchanges between the government and the
Catholic leader.
   The letters also sent signals that church-state relations had
once again deteriorated in Nicaragua.
   The strong Roman Catholic Church backed the 1979 revolution that
ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza and supported the Sandinistas. But
the church later became the staunchest government critic and
suffered repression.
   Since the signing of a regional peace plan in August by five
Central American presidents including Ortega, the situation seemed
to be improving.
   The government allowed two exiled priests to return, permitted
the Catholic Radio station to reopen and in November asked the
cardinal to be mediator.
   The cardinal's last letter to Ortega was sent March 2, hours
before Ortega removed him as mediator. In it, the prelate
reiterated the need for talks to ``put an end to the grueling war
that daily claims 50 or 60 young Nicaraguans'' and said he was open
to discussing a new outline for negotiations.
   A church source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Sandinistas hoped to pressure Obando y Bravo into backing out of
his mediation role. When that failed, Ortega made his move and
visited Obando y Bravo that night.
   Ortega made it look like he was deferring to the cardinal's
wishes.
   ``The cardinal himself had suggested some time ago that a direct
meeting (with the Contras) and in our country would be very
important,'' Ortega said.
   For the past four years, Obando y Bravo has urged direct talks.
But the Sandinistas had repeatedly refused to sit down with the
Contras until they were forced to do so by the regional peace plan.
   The plan signed by Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Honduras calls for cease-fires, democratization, amnesties and
an end to tactical or logistical support for insurgencies.
   The Sandinistas say peace talks should be held with the U.S.
government because it financed and trained the rebels. The Reagan
administration refuses.
   During the first few rounds of talks aimed at working out a
cease-fire, the cardinal acted as a go-between in indirect
negotiations.
   In January, Ortega proposed direct talks but with a mediator.
   After Obando y Bravo was asked to step down as mediator, the
Contras demanded he be involved in the meetings ``as witness,
moderator and guarantor of the talks.'' The president responded on
March 7 by calling on the cardinal to act as a witness, a role he
accepted and which satisfied the rebels.
   The first direct talks in Nicaragua were scheduled for last
week, March 9-11, but were canceled at the last minute by
Sandinistas after the Contras backed out and pressed for a
preliminary meeting.
   The Contras later dropped that demand.
   More than 40,000 people have been killed since November 1981,
when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government.

<HEAD>House Leader Says Delegates Will Broker at Democratic Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A brokered Democratic national convention
is possible, but it's too late for anyone but delegates to do the
horse trading, according to Rep. Tom Foley.
   Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader who expects to be
convention parliamentarian when the Democrats meet in Atlanta in
July, said Monday the party's nominee likely won't be determined
beforehand.
   But if there is any brokering to be done at the Democratic
convention, it will be by the delegates, he said.
   ``I think there's a possibility that no candidate will go into
the convention with a sufficient number of delegates to be
nominated,'' he said. ``But I don't expect anybody else to be
nominated, other than those four or five that are now in the race.
   ``Brokering is largely going to be a decision of the delegates
themselves, not any sort of backroom `kingmaking' operation,'' said
Foley, who supports House colleague Dick Gephardt of Missouri.

   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., has

lavishly praised Bush.
   ``I have respect for George Bush,'' Weicker said. ``He has an
open mind that's guided by fact and logic, rather than ideology. He
is also a compassionate man.''
   Connecticut's presidential primary is March 29. Bush is
considered the favorite in the GOP contest in Connecticut because
he grew up in the state, his father was a U.S. senator from
Connecticut and his mother and brother still live in Greenwich.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says Jesse Jackson
is ``electable'' as a Democratic presidential candidate and ``has
done extremely well'' at getting out an appealing message.
   ``Of course he's electable,'' said fellow Democrat Cuomo Monday
during an inpromptu news conference following a speech to New
York's county officials. ``If the Democrats _ and that's a majority
in the country, is it not? _ if the Democrats say they want
Jackson, how can you say he's not electable?''
   Because he is black, some political analysts and fellow
Democrats have suggested that Jackson couldn't be elected president.
   ``His message is appealing,'' Cuomo added. ``He's saying to the
people ... that we have many people who have been left out that we
need to educate and house through job training because we can't
make it without them. It's not just a matter of compassion, it's a
matter of common sense.''
   Cuomo has said that Jackson stands a good chance of winning New
York's important April 19 primary but he has refused to endorse any
of the active Democratic candidates.
   Cuomo, who announced more than a year ago that he wouldn't seek
the Democratic presidential nomination, also has refused to rule
out accepting a draft for the nomination if there's a deadlocked
national convention.

   A study of network evening newscasts from Jan.
1 through Super Tuesday March 8 says Democrat Jesse Jackson got the
best television coverage and Republican Pat Robertson got the most
negative.
   The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a non-partisan study
group, said it studied 532 news items involving the election and
found:
   _Evaluations of every major candidate, based on clearly positive
or negative statements from all sources relating to character, job
performance, campaign performance or issue stands, became more
negative after the New Hampshire primary Feb. 16.
   _ Telecast comments involving Jackson were favorable 74 percent
of the time, compared with 90 percent this year before New
Hampshire. He also nearly tripled his share of the Democrats'
coverage, from 9 percent before New Hampshire to 26 percent in the
weeks leading up to March 8 Super Tuesday.
   _Robertson dropped from 70 percent positive evaluations before
New Hampshire to 33 percent after it. Comments about his prospects
also became more negative.
   The analysts also said there have been four stories on the
campaign horse race for every story on policy issues since the Feb.
8 Iowa caucuses and the issues most frequently mentioned are taxes

<HEAD>LaRouche Challenge of Simon Petitions Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Elections has rejected
challenges to Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's petitions for a spot on
New York's April 19 Democratic presidential primary ballot.
   The challenges had been filed by political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche and Monday's ruling meant Simon's name will appear on the
ballot.
   Board spokesman Steven LaFever said that after a lengthy
hearing, the board ruled that Simon had filed petitions containing
the valid signatures of 21,263 registered Democrats. His original
petitions had contained 22,076 signatures and only 10,000 are
needed to qualify for the ballot.
   The ruling in favor of Simon means that the New York ballot for
Democrats will include all the major Democratic candidates and
LaRouche.
   LaRouche is also seeking the Democratic nomination. His
petitions have not been challenged.

<TEXT>
   A chief accuser of impeached Gov. Evan
Mecham got legal advice on how to deal with Mecham from the lawyer
who has become acting Gov. Rose Mofford's chief of staff.
   Andrew Hurwitz, who also served as chief of staff during part of
Bruce Babbitt's governorship, confirmed Monday that he provided
legal advice to Department of Public Safety Director Ralph T.
Milstead for reduced fees.
   The attorney-client relationship with Milstead is not disclosed
on Hurwitz's conflict-of-interest forms but he confirmed it after
The Associated Press learned of it.
   ``I just don't see that it was necessary,'' he said. ``There
certainly is no personal interest here. I don't gain or lose
anything at all.
   ``Am I a longstanding friend of Ralph Milstead? That's pretty
clear,'' he added. ``The fact that I like him I don't think is a
big issue.''
   Milstead testified at Mecham's impeachment trial that the
governor ordered him not to cooperate with a state attorney
general's inquiry into an alleged death threat. Defense lawyers
subsequently accused Milstead of denying Mecham a fair trial by
attempting to intimidate defense witnesses.
   Mecham, a Republican, wrote a letter Monday to Mrs. Mofford, a
Democrat, demanding that Milstead and two assistants be placed on
leave. Hurwitz, who supervises Milstead's department for Mofford,
said the three would not be placed on leave pending an FBI
investigation and another inquiry he is supervising.
   Hurwitz, a private attorney on loan to Mrs. Mofford by his firm,
acknowledged it might be inappropriate for him to continue
supervising the internal investigation.
   Mrs. Mofford, elected as secretary of state, became acting
governor when the House impeached Mecham and will become the
permanent governor if the Senate convicts him or if she wins a
multi-candidate May 17 recall election against Mecham.
   Hurwitz, who only last Friday said that full disclosure of
potential conflicts was vital for public confidence, acknowledged
that publicity about his relationship with Milstead could harm Mrs.
Mofford politically.
   Hurwitz said Milstead came to him and law partner Jack LaSota
after Mecham was elected in 1986.
   Mecham was widely thought to be thinking of trying to fire
Milstead despite the state police chief's four-year contract, and
Milstead ``called us up and sought some legal advice,'' Hurwitz
said.
   He declined to elaborate, citing attorney-client privilege, but
said he believed that the bill, discounted to ``something like
half-rates'' because Milstead was a friend, came to less than
$2,000 and probably less than $1,000.
   Hurwitz said he had not done any work for Milstead in about six
months, adding ``I don't represent him now.'' Hurwitz said he
stopped advising Milstead before the events occurred that are at
issue in the impeachment trial.
   But LaSota said in a separate interview he considered the
relationship to be ongoing.

   Whitey Bloom knows about life's ups and
downs, and ups and downs, and ups and downs.
   Bloom, a stocky junior high school teacher, knocked off 32,770
push-ups in 24 hours during the weekend, unofficially breaking by
197 the Guinness Book of World Records' mark for the most push-ups
in a single day.
   With about 60 friends and supporters cheering him on, Bloom
broke the record shortly after noon Sunday. He plans to mail a log
book and other papers to Guinness for official confirmation.
   Bloom said he slept about 20 minutes during the 24 hours.
Support from friends was essential.
   ``The last couple of hours, they were really cheering me on,''
he said Monday. ``I was just dogged tired and I'm not sure I would
have made it without them.''
   Bloom trained for months with a daily regimen of several
thousand push-ups. In a practice session around Christmas, he did
16,000 push-ups in about seven hours, ``just to get a feel for it.''
   Now he just feels sore.
   ``The best thing about it is when I woke up this morning, I
didn't feel obligated to do my usual 1,000,'' he said.

   Colossus, a 502-pound ape reputed to be
the largest lowland gorilla in captivity, was adjusting well to his
new home in a private zoo after moving from New Hampshire, his
keepers said.
   ``He's doing wonderfully,'' said Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo.
``He's eating well, vocalizing, a lot of chest pounding and
stomping on his bed.''
   The 20-year-old gorilla was moved Sunday night from Hudson,
N.H., where he had been purchased from Benson's Animal Park when it
went out of business.
   The ape was flown on a DC-3 piloted by Stan Brock of the ``Wild
Kingdom'' television show to Pensacola and then trucked to The Zoo
on Monday.
   Moving pads were put around and inside Colossus' packing crate
to keep him warm during the trip, Quinn said. He developed an
attachment for the blankets, taking a pair with him to his new home
in two adjoining cages, or bedrooms as Quinn prefers to call them.
   ``He's got those blankets with him all the time,'' Quinn said,
adding that no one has volunteered to try to take them away.
   ``We don't short sheet gorillas,'' he joked.
   Quinn hopes to breed Colossus with female gorillas, but the ape
hasn't seen another gorilla since he was captured in the wild as an
infant.
   His first introduction will be by television. He enjoyed a
television in his cage in New Hampshire, and zoo officials hope to
install a TV and play videotapes for him in his new home, Quinn
said.

   One of the country's most wanted narcotics
traffickers has been arrested and charged with importing 1,000
pounds of heroin into the United States from Asia over a three-year
period.
   Kon Yu-Leung, 44, who was arrested Sunday night outside a
Manhattan hotel, had been the Drug Enforcement Administration's No.
1 heroin target for about 2{ years, said U.S. Attorney Andrew
Maloney.
   Kon's drug ring was much larger than well-known heroin cases
operated by traditional organized crime groups, said Robert
Stutman, head of the DEA's New York office. The ``French
Connection'' case involved 70 pounds of heroin, the ``Pizza
Connection'' about 200, he said at a news conference with Maloney.
   Maloney said Kon was believed responsible for bringing into the
country twice the 1,000 pounds of heroin he was charged with
importing.
   ``Clearly, the levels of heroin we're dealing with here are
almost mind-boggling,'' said Stutman.
   The heroin from Kon's drug ring was smuggled into the country
between 1984 and 1987 through various means, including suitcases
and in shipments of vases, ice buckets, T-shirts and wall plaques,
Maloney said.
   Couriers then carried millions of dollars in drug proceeds back
to Hong Kong to be laundered, authorities said. Kon allegedly used
$20 million to buy commercial real estate in the New York area and
San Francisco.
   Stutman said Kon sold the heroin to distributors at an estimated
wholesale price of $100,000 per pound. Authorities estimate the
street value of one pound of heroin at $1 million.
   Law enforcement authorities confiscated 570 of the 1,000 pounds
alleged to have been imported by Kon's organization in several
seizures over the years, Stutman said.
   Kon first came to the DEA's attention in November 1984 when a
shipment of 250 pounds of heroin, believed to be destined for the
United States, was seized in the Hong Kong harbor from a fishing
trawler.
   Kon, the alleged mastermind, eluded arrest by moving between
Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines, Maloney said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Catherine Palmer said Kon had at least
six phony passports and traveled under numerous fictitious names.
   She said Kon, who was born in mainland China and later moved to
Hong Kong before becoming a fugitive, had numerous businesses in
Asia and the United States, including several fur companies and a
firm called the Kon China Trading Co. He also allegedly had a watch
manufacturing company in Paraguay.
   Maloney said federal authorities lured Kon to New York after a
federal grand jury indicted him. He declined to give any details
concerning the circumstances of Kon's arrest.
   Authorities also arrested John Routollo, a former New York
police officer, at his Montclair, N.J., home Sunday night.
Routollo, 50, was charged with picking up the heroin, usually at
the New York Hilton Hotel, for distribution in the United States.
   Maloney said that before Routollo left the force in 1981 he
supplied weapons to Kon's organization through his position in the
police department's office of pistols and licenses.

   Would-be assassin Lynette ``Squeaky''
Fromme was convicted of escape after she told jurors she fled from
prison because she thought her lover and mentor, mass murderer
Charles Manson, had cancer.
   A federal jury on Monday convicted Fromme of the two-day escape
from the Federal Correctional Institution at Alderson, where she is
serving a life sentence for her 1975 attempt on then-President
Gerald Ford's life.
   ``You don't have any choice,'' she told the jurors while acting
as her own attorney. ``I'm guilty as charged, legally, and without
remorse morally, so that's that.''
   The jury returned its verdict within 10 minutes. U.S. District
Judge Elizabeth Hallanan set sentencing for April 28.
   Fromme, 39, faces five years in prison and $250,000 fine for the
conviction.
   Fromme, who escaped Dec. 23 and was recaptured two miles away on
Christmas Day, has been described as the main member of the Manson
``family.'' Manson is serving a life sentence in San Quentin prison
in California for the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight
others.
   Fromme told the jury Monday she attempted to escape because ``I
got word that (Manson) had cancer.
   ``He needs a relative, somebody to check on him,'' she said of
Manson, whom she described as ``my husband, my brother, my father,
my son, the man who's been my friend.''
   She said she decided to escape because ``my access to him is so
limited, I've been feeling helpless for years.
   ``If love means anything at all it means stop feeling helpless
... (and) take action if necessary.''
   Fromme called only herself as a witness. She carefully followed
Hallanan's instructions that her testimony had to be in the form of
questions and answers.
   She questioned herself on the pronounciation of her name and
cautioned: ``Miss Fromme, you talk too much,'' and ``Wait a minute,
you're getting ahead of yourself.''
   Fromme also cross-examined the four prison employees called as
government witnesses. Each indicated the institution _ which has an
official capacity of 670 prisoners _ holds about 1,000 inmates. In
her testimony, she told the jury the overcrowding was another
reason she escaped.
   ``The prison has become more and more crowded, and the
institution staff has become more and more tense,'' she said.
   Ford was unharmed when a Secret Service agent grabbed the
semi-automatic pistol from Fromme on Sept. 5, 1975. In San
Francisco 17 days later, Ford again escaped injury from would-be
assassin Sara Jane Moore, who fired a revolver at him. She
eventually pleaded guilty and received a life sentence.
   In 1979, Moore also escaped from the Alderson prison but was
recaptured hours later. She is now at the federal prison in
Pleasanton, Calif.

<HEAD>Railey Won't Challenge Lawsuit, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Methodist minister has decided not to
contest a lawsuit by his mother-in-law accusing him of a near-fatal
choking attack on his wife, saying legal fees would be too costly.
   ``He told me that he had decided his assets would be best used
in the support and maintenance of his children,'' said Doug Mulder,
a defense attorney who represented Walker Railey before a Dallas
County grand jury investigating the attack.
   Mulder said the former minister decided not to contest the
lawsuit because of estimates it would cost nearly $100,000 in legal
fees. Mulder called the lawsuit a ``publicity stunt,'' and said his
client could win if he spent the money.
   The suit was filed by Billie Jo Nicolai, seeking an undetermined
amount of damages in the April attack on her daughter, Peggy
Railey. Mrs. Railey, 39, never regained consciousness and remains
in a coma in a Tyler nursing home.
   Mrs. Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold, said Monday he will seek a
default judgment but will ask for a jury trial to determine damages.
   ``The question now is, when do I want to go to court?' It could
be tomorrow or it could be a couple of months. It depends on
Peggy's best interests. I'm not going to run my schedule according
to Walker's schedule,'' Arnold said.
   Railey's father-in-law said he was disappointed there was no
response to the lawsuit.
   ``We thought he might come through and answer some of our
questions. It sure would help, but it didn't turn out that way,''
he said in a Monday night telephone interview from his rural Smith
County home. ``It really is disappointing. I guess we're just going
to have to keep waiting.''
   Without a response, a judge could rule against the former senior
minister of the First United Methodist Church of Dallas and award
damages in his absence.
   Railey, 40, was not charged, but both his attorney and Dallas
County Assistant District Attorney Norm Kinne identified him the
prime suspect.
   Railey refused to cooperate with police, denying his involvement
and then invoking his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination 43 times when questioned by a grand jury.
   A psychologist, Lucy Papillon, reportedly told the grand jury
that she and Railey were romantically involved and had discussed
marriage before the attack.
   Railey is living in San Francisco, where he rented an apartment
with Ms. Papillon, Arnold said.
   Railey assigned his wife's guardianship to her mother, and that
of his two children, ages 5 and 2, to family friends in Dallas.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said it fired four more long-range
missiles into Tehran today, and Iran said civilians were killed
when Iraqi missiles crashed into residential areas of the city.
   Iran claimed its jet fighters ``heavily pounded'' Iraqi troop
concentrations in southern Iraq today, inflicting substantial
casualties and losses. Iraq did not comment on the report.
   In another development, the Soviet Union acknowledged at the
United Nations in New York on Monday that it had failed to win
support for a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the
deadly missile duel.
   The Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said four missiles
were fired into Tehran today. It reported eight such missile
strikes on Monday.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
said ``a number'' of civilians were killed in missile attacks on
residential areas of the city overnight. It did not say how many
rockets hit Tehran.
   On Monday, Iran said missiles killed 26 civilians and wounded 50
in Tehran. Iraq also reported civilian casualties in Baghdad but
gave no figures.
   Iraq says it has fired 13 missiles into Tehran since the duel
with Iran resumed with a single rocket fired into the Iranian
capital Sunday night after a two-day truce. Iran has fired two into
Baghdad since Sunday.
   Declaring an all-out offensive on Iranian cities, Iraq said it
launched air raids on ``military and economic targets'' in six
western border towns Monday.
   IRNA also said Revolutionary Guards commandos pushed into
northeast Iraq to within 12 miles of the provincial capital of
Sulaimaniyeh early Monday, seizing a dozen villages and killing or
wounding 1,000 Iraqis.
   Iran also said its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi
fighter-bomber in the northeastern battles, while Iraq claimed its
helicoptergunships downed an Iranian helicopter.
   An uneasy two-day truce that ended Sunday had brought a brief
respite following a 12-day exchange of missiles, artillery fire and
air raids by both sides that killed or wounded hundreds of
civilians.
   Iraq said it fired 71 missiles into Tehran, the holy city of Qom
and the central city of Isfahan, capital of ancient Persia, between
Feb. 29 and March 11. Iran said it shot 27 missiles into Tehran and
two into the northeastern city of Mosul in that period.
   At the United Nations, Soviet Ambassador Alexander Belonogov
acknowledged on Monday that the Soviet bid for a new resolution on
the ``war of the cities'' had failed after the council met behind
closed doors.
   ``Our personal preference would be a resolution of the Security
Council,'' but the important thing is ``not the form but the
essence'' of the council's action, he told reporters after a
closed-door council meeting.
   The United States saw the proposal as a maneuver to deflect
attention from the American push for a worldwide arms embargo
against Iran to punish it for refusing to honor the council's July
20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan.
   Instead of a new resolution, the council is expected to issue a
statement later this week calling for an end to the missile
attacks. A presidential statement is the mildest form of council
action.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since 1980.

   The State Department says an incursion of
Mexican soldiers into California was an ``infringement of U.S.
sovereignty,'' but Mexican officials played down the incident as a
harmless mistake.
   Mexican diplomats said the four members of the Mexican naval
infantry, carrying automatic weapons, crossed the border without
realizing it while in pursuit of alleged drug smugglers. The four
were arrested without incident near the border and were released to
Mexican military officials late Monday.
   U.S. Border Patrol officials said no charges would be filed, but
the State Department said the incident warranted further discussion
between the two governments.
   ``This action is an infringement of U.S. territorial
sovereignty,'' said Bud Jacobs, a State Department spokesman in
Washington, D.C. ``It's unacceptable regardless of their motivation
or intention.''
   ``I'm sure we'll take it up with the Mexican government,'' he
added.
   Mexican military or police have no authority to enter the United
States when pursuing criminal suspects, Jacobs said.
   ``The international line is marked clearly. It was not just an
inadvertent entry,'' said Dale Cozart, chief agent in the U.S.
Border Patrol's San Diego sector.
   ``The line there is not clearly marked and the marines were
confused,'' said Leonardo French, an official with the Mexican
Embassy in Washington. He added, ``What's important was that there
were no shots fired or any violence.''
   The four men were arrested late Sunday night after a Border
Patrol helicopter crew spotted them talking with a group of
revelers, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said the armed men
admitted they knew they were in the United States when they crossed
the border.
   Border Patrol spokesman Mike Nicley said the U.S. investigation
was complete and no charges would be filed.
   He would not say whether U.S. authorities accepted the soldiers'
explanation that they were pursuing drug smugglers. American
authorities failed to locate the revelers to find out what happened
during the encounter.
   Nicley said he didn't know what punishment the soldiers might
face in Mexico. American authorities described the soldiers as
being equivalent in rank to privates.
   In a similar 1986 incident in New Mexico, Border Patrol agents
arrested seven Mexican judicial police agents who said they had
accidentally strayed less than a mile into New Mexico while on an
anti-drug-smuggling assignment.
   U.S. officials seized the stolen car the police officers were
occupying, several automatic weapons, 6 grams of cocaine and
$10,000 cash. Their commander said the officers probably didn't
know the cocaine was in the car.
   The seven were sent home after questioning and were not charged.
   On July 16, 1977, an altercation between Tijuana police and
members of the a joint Border Patrol-San Diego police unit left two
Mexican officers and one San Diego policeman wounded.
   San Diego police said the Tijuana officers were on the U.S. side
of the border, but Mexican police accused the Americans of firing
across the border.
   A Tijuana officer was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

guerrillas who were shot by British troops while allegedly
preparing a car-bomb attack in Gibraltar.
   The March 6 killing of the unarmed guerrillas in the British
colony sparked riots in Belfast for much of the following week.
   In another development, an IRA gunman and a Catholic civilian
were reportedly shot and killed in Belfast on Monday night and
early today.
   The nine-hour procession for the slain IRA guerrillas was marked
by a confrontation at the border over Irish flags on the coffins
and accusations by the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, that police
tried to break up the cortege and twice crashed a vehicle into one
of the hearses.
   Crowds of Protestants waving British flags threw rocks and other
objects at the procession on at least six occasions as it traveled
by road the 40 miles from the border town of Carrickaron in the
Irish Republic to Belfast.
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said police deliberately slowed the
cortege where Protestants had gathered ``to allow them to throw
stones and jeer.'' Police denied the accusation, saying their
concern was to ensure security.
   A few hours before the cortege arrived in Belfast, police said
British soldiers shot a gunman who fired on an army patrol near the
home of one of the dead guerrillas. The man, identified by police
as Kevin McCracken, 33, died shortly afterward in the hospital.
   A police statement said McCracken was jailed in 1978 for
membership in the outlawed Irish Republican Army, illegal
possession of guns and criminal damage and was released on parole
in 1985.
   An unidentified Catholic was shot today at point-blank range
from a motorcycle as he arrived for work at a south Belfast store,
police said. No group claimed responsibility.
   In Dublin, police said they were investigating a suspected
letter bomb blast overnight at the city's central mail sorting
office which blew a hole in the wooden floor and slightly injured
two postal workers.
   News reports that the package was addressed to the British
Embassy in Dublin were dismissed as speculation by detectives.
   The IRA said its members fired a volley over a makeshift shrine
in Belfast as a farewell salute to Mairead Farrell, 31; Sean
Savage, 24; and Daniel McCann, 30, who died in Gibraltar.
   The traditional paramilitary salute, which is banned in Northern
Ireland as an illegal display of firearms, was fired Monday
afternoon as the bodies landed in Dublin, the IRA said in a
statement issued through Sinn Fein.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
promised in newspaper advertisements not to interfere with the
funerals if the IRA did not mount a gunfire salute over the coffins.
   The funerals are expected to take place on Wednesday in west
Belfast, with burial in the Catholic Milltown Cemetery alongside
many other IRA guerrillas killed in nearly 20 years of political
and sectarian strife in the province.
   The coffins arrived in Dublin on a plane chartered by Sinn Fein
to a reception by about 1,000 supporters. The slow procession to
the border, with thousands lining the route, was uneventful.
   At the border, two senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers
demanded the removal of the Irish tricolors draped on each coffin.
   The tricolor, Ireland's national flag, is regarded by Northern
Ireland Protestants as a symbol of the IRA's fight to drive Britain
out of Northern Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province
with the overwhelmingly Catholic republic.
   After a 30-minute confrontation, a compromise was reached
whereby the flags were folded, replaced on the coffins and covered
with wreaths.
   At Newry, fives miles inside Northern Ireland, the hearses were
paraded around the largely Catholic town for two hours in front of
cheering IRA supporters.
   On the outskirts of Newry, crowds from a Protestant municipal
housing project jeered, waved British flags and hurled bricks,
bottles and stones at the cortege. Windows in some of the cars were
broken by the missiles.
   Similar scenes repeated themselves along the road to Belfast.
   The coffins containing the bodies of the three guerrillas were
taken into the homes of their families in West Belfast.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci wants
his Soviet counterpart to cut production of tanks, artillery and
heavy missiles to prove he is seriously pursuing a new defensive
military doctrine.
   Carlucci, speaking to reporters today en route to a meeting in
Bern with Soviet counterpart Dmitri Yazov, said that despite the
extensive publicity surrounding the emerging Kremlin doctrine of
``reasonable sufficiency,'' he has seen ``absolutely no practical
change.''
   ``If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue
to modernize,'' Carlucci told reporters aboard his Air Force jet.
   The plane refueled in Ireland and then completed the flight to
Switzerland.
   Carlucci was to attend a dinner with Yazov tonight, and sit down
Wednesday and Thursday for the first ever business session between
U.S. and Soviet defense secretaries.
   Yazov and other Soviet officials have said they are moving
toward a new doctrine with a defensive posture. But they have never
acknowledged that their past doctrine embodied an offensive
posture, and various Soviet commentators have offered different
views on the meaning of ``reasonable sufficiency.''
   ``That's a question, by the way, I intend to ask him,'' said
Carlucci. ``I'm still not sure what it is.''
   If Yazov wants to demonstrate that the Kremlin is moving from an
offensive to a defensive doctrine, the Soviets should slack off in
tank and artillery production and ``maybe'' desist from the SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missile that carries 10 nuclear
warheads, said Carlucci.
   ``One of the most important indicators, I would think, would be
tanks. But tanks continue to pour out,'' he said. ``So there is no
indication at the other end of the pipeline that there has been any
change.''
   The U.S. side also wants to discuss so-called ``dangerous
incidents'' such as a collision involving U.S. and Soviet warships
off the Soviet Black Sea coast last month, and the fatal shooting
by a Soviet soldier of U.S. Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson on March 24,
1985, in East Germany.
   ``One idea I have is for them to apologize for Maj. Nicholson,
which they still haven't done,'' said Carlucci.
   The Reagan administration wants the Soviets to agree on broad
guidelines to curtail such incidents.
   The Soviets last month rammed two U.S. warships as they passed
through Soviet territorial waters in an exercise designed to assert
the ``right of innocent passage'' from international waters on one
side of the Crimean peninsula to the other.
   On a personal level, Carlucci said he was ``looking forward'' to
meeting Yazov.
   The meeting, the first of its kind and perhaps the first in a
series of high-level military consultations, ``is kind of an
interesting idea,'' he said.
   ``He was....mildly critical of `glasnost' as applied to the
military, which seems to be a bit at variance with the standard
line,'' Carlucci said.
   Yazov, although generally supportive of the reform policies of
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has said the policy of
glasnost, or greater openness, must be restricted in the armed
forces.
   Carlucci, dwelling on the meaning of the emerging Soviet
military doctrine, said that ``sufficiency is a word that has been
around for a long time'' since the detente era of the 1970s.
   ``Sufficiency can mean anything you define it to be, as best I
can tell,'' he said. ``The (Soviet) military is saying that
sufficiency is sufficient to meet the threat ... and , `Oh, by the
way, you have to have sufficient offense so that if the other
fellow attacks you, you can attack him all the way to the ocean.'
   ``That doesn't sound to me like anything new. At the same time,
Gorbachev is saying that there is something new.
   ``Some (Soviet) academics are saying, `Well, maybe this means we
can rethink our military establishment and do the same thing with
less.' So obviously there is some kind of debate going on.''

   Unseasonably cold air sent thermometers plunging across the
South, producing record lows in some areas and bringing freezing
temperatures early today as far south as Midland, Texas,
Shreveport, La., and Atlanta.
   Meanwhile, snow showers sprinkled the Northeast, and reached
from the upper Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes region to
the Appalachians. Snow also was scattered from southern New England
into New Jersey. The heaviest snow continued to fall along the
shores of the Great Lakes.
   More than 14 inches of snow fell in the Conneaut area of
northeast Ohio, with 8 to 10 inches reported in Ashtabula, Ohio,
and 4 to 6 inches in Geneva, Ohio.
   More than 2 feet of snow has buried portions of the Snow Belt in
northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan since Saturday.
   Another storm system over the northern Rockies was spreading
snow from Idaho and western Montana across western Wyoming and
northern Utah. The central and southern mountains of Idaho were
expected to receive about 5 inches of snow by late this afternoon.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect today over the mountains of
Montana and northwest Wyoming, with up to a foot of snow possible.
   Snow was forecast to increase southward into the central Rockies
by tonight. Winter storm watches were been posted for tonight and
Wednesday across northern and western Wyoming and the northern
mountains of Utah.
   A record low of 22 degrees was set in Asheville, N.C., beating
the old mark for the date of 24 degrees, set in 1979. Greer, S.C.,
reached 23, one degree below the record set on March 14, 1968; and
Meridian, Miss., hit 26, beating the 27-degree mark for the same
date in 1970.
   For today, snow was forecast from New England to the Ohio Valley
and Great Lakes region, and across the northern Rockies, with
scattered snow showers over the northern half of the Plateau region
and the central Rockies. Sunny skies were predicted over the
Plains, the Pacific Coast and the southern third of the nation.
Winds were expected to be strong and gusty over the northern
Rockies and the southern Plateau.
   Most of the nation will have highs in the 30s, 40s or 50s. Highs
will be in the 20s in the northern Rockies and from North Dakota
across the Great lakes region and the Ohio Valley. Temperatures
will reach the 60s and 70s from California across the desert
Southwest, from southern and central New Mexico across southern
Texas, and over the Florida peninsula.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from zero at
Lemmon, S.D., to 63 at Key West Naval Air Station, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the first
Soviet leader to visit Yugoslavia in eight years, today visited the
grave of Josip Broz Tito, the Yugoslav president who once ruptured
ties with Moscow.
   Gorbachev, who began an official visit to Yugoslavia on Monday,
said he ``got off to a good start'' in important talks with
Yugoslav leaders.
   He spoke with reporters before agreeing to a new declaration on
Soviet-Yugoslav relations with Yugoslav Communist Party chief Bosko
Krunic.
   The document is expected to chart a new path for relations
between Moscow and this nation, which broke with the Soviet bloc in
1948.
   The declaration incorporates previous documents from the 1950s,
when Nikita S. Khrushchev mended relations with Tito. Gorbachev is
the first Soviet leader to visit since Leonid Brezhnev attended
Tito's funeral in 1980.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa later planted a tree in Belgrade's
Park of Friendship, established in 1961 after the first conference
of the non-aligned movement. Gorbachev and his wife joked and
chatted with a group of children who gathered around the larch tree
before posing for photographs.
   Asked how his visit was going, Gorbachev said the atmosphere was
``businesslike.'' He added: ``I think some of the things we are
doing during this visit will be of great significance for our
mutual relations.''
   Monday's talks with Yugoslav leaders produced ``deep
understanding'' between the two sides and ``we felt that there is a
need for joint action in the future,'' he said. ``We got off to a
good start,'' he added.
   On Monday, Gorbachev said ethnic minorities that rioted in his
country are raising longheld grievances, not challenging the
Communist government.
   At least 32 people were killed in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait
in fighting two weeks ago between Azeris and their Armenian
neighbors, who have staged mass street protests in recent weeks.
   ``Show me the country in which there are no such problems. If
you show me, I will travel there right away, without stopping in
Moscow on return from Yugoslavia,'' Gorbachev told reporters on
Monday.
   In talks Monday with Yugoslav leaders, the Soviets stressed that
no Communist nation has an absolute model for building socialism,
Soviet deputy foreign minister Vadim Loginov said.
   Gorbachev showed the Western politician's touch he has exhibited
on previous trips abroad, stopping his motorcade Monday to shake
hands with Belgrade residents and chatting at a photo session.
   Yugoslavia, a federation of six republics and two autonomous
regions, has wide ethnic, linguistic and cultural differences among
its own bickering minorities. Yugoslavia's assistant foreign
minister, Ilija Djukic, said the nationalities problems was raised
only briefly during Monday's talks.
   He quoted Gorbachev as saying in a discussion of social problems
that ``there are no problems that would be solved once and for all,
that conditions change, that everything requires improvement ...
including the question of nationalities.''
   Djukic and Loginov told a news conference Monday that the first
round of talks was frank but very cordial, and that the two sides
agreed Soviet premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov will visit Yugoslavia at a
future date.
   That visit is likely to focus on the problems plaguing the
extensive trade between the two nations.
   Since the 1950s, when Khrushchev lifted an economic blockade
imposed on Yugoslavia by Josef Stalin, the Soviet Union has become
Yugoslavia's biggest trading partner. Moscow delivers crude oil and
other materials to Yugoslavia in exchange for manufactured goods,
including shoes, clothes and technology.
   The recent drop in oil prices has led to an imbalance as the
Soviets refused to increase quantities of crude oil exports.
   There has been speculation that the Kremlin's $1.4 billion paper
debt to Yugoslavia in trade may be compensated by the Soviets
building a subway to free Belgrade's traffic-clogged streets.
   Loginov said on Monday the Soviets are studying in detail the
system of worker self-management Yugoslavia evolved under Tito, and
will incorporate any relevant features in Gorbachev's own program
of Kremlin reforms.
   The system by which workers nominally run Yugoslav enterprises
has looked increasingly frail in the 1980s, when triple-digit
inflation, rising unemployment and a $20 billion debt have made the
boom of the 1970s a distant memory.

   Former Vice President Walter Mondale today said
Chinese leaders are committed to their open-door policy and an
ambitious plan to allow coastal areas to develop ahead of the rest
of the country.
   Mondale also told a news conference that the Chinese eagerly
seek more foreign investment in order to expand exports. He said
they are prepared to open up domestic markets and remove other
obstacles that have discouraged foreign businessmen from investing
in China.
   The Minnesota Democrat, who arrived in Beijing last week for
business connected to his Minneapolis-based law firm, met Acting
Premier Li Peng, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and other
Chinese leaders during his stay. He was to leave for Tokyo later
today.
   On Monday he said he discerned no signs of differences between
Zhao and Li on the pace and scope of economic reforms and China's
open-door policies.
   Zhao, the protege of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, is believed to
be more aggressive in pushing for market-oriented reforms, while Li
prefers a slower, more cautious approach.
   ``My impression was that Li Peng was just as committed'' to
reform, Mondale said. ``He didn't show any qualifications.''
   He said Chinese leaders appeared united behind Zhao's plan to
put priority on developing and opening up coastal regions.

   The British government today lost
its fight for damages from a newspaper for publishing sections of
the book Spycatcher.
   The court dismissed Britain's appeal, which sought damages and
an account of profits from the book written by Peter Wright, a
former assistant director of the British security service MI5 who
now lives in Australia.
   The British government says the book revealed security secrets.
   The president of the Court of Appeal, Sir Robin Cooke, said the
claim was defeated by two defenses from The Dominion, a
Wellington-based newspaper.
   The first was that there was enough prior publication to destroy
confidentiality. The second was that the New Zealand public
interest justified publication in The Dominion.

   The first movement of Ludwig van
Beethoven's lost 10th symphony, reconstructed from drafts found in
West Berlin, will be premiered in London later this year, a West
German newspaper reported.
   The Bonn Express on Monday quoted Barry Cooper, a professor at
Scotland's University of Aberdeen, as saying the piece will be
performed in London at the end of the year.
   The newspaper did not give an exact date or location for the
performance.
   Cooper and Sieghard Brandenburg, the director of the Beethoven
Archive in Bonn, have said they found musical sketches and notes by
the composer.
   Cooper said the first movement, about 15 minutes long, was put
together based on the documents found in West Berlin.

<TEXT>
   Safeway Stores Inc. agreed to pay $995,000 in
penalties to the U.S. Commerce Department to settle charges that
the company cooperated with a long-standing Arab boycott against
Israel.
   ``It (the settlement) is equitable, and it indicated we take
enforcement of the anti-boycott laws very seriously and will
continue to vigorously enforce them,'' said Paul Freedenberg,
undersecretary of commerce for export administration.
   The settlement announced Monday was the largest of its kind, the
Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   For more than 30 years, Arab countries have boycotted Israeli
goods and companies that do business with Israel. A U.S. law passed
in 1977 forbids Americans to comply with the boycott.
   The department filed charges against three stores licensed by
Oakland-based Safeway, two in Saudi Arabia and one in Kuwait.
   Commerce officials alleged the three stores refused to do
business with companies on an anti-Israeli blacklist and store
managers instructed suppliers and customers to avoid such business
relations.
   Safeway officials said the penalty, less than one-quarter of
what the department originally sought, absolved the company of
wrongdoing.
   ``The settlement terms clearly vindicate the position that
Safeway's conduct in its dealings with licensees in the Middle East
did not merit the harsh penalties originally sought,'' said Peter
A. Magowan, chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We agree with the purpose and the spirit of the anti-boycott
laws,'' he said.
   Three years ago Citicorp was fined $323,000, the previous
largest anti-boycott penalty.

   Almost nine of 10 Americans with less than a
high school education can't understand the instructions for the
simplest tax form, and IRS forms in general require greater reading
skill than the Wall Street Journal, a study concludes.
   Even more reading ability is required to comprehend an Internal
Revenue Service notice of taxes owed, says James W. Childs,
director of the tax-clinic program at the University of Akron
School of Law.
   ``If the taxpayer cannot read the instructions, how can the
government expect compliance?'' Childs asked Monday as the Senate
Finance subcommittee that oversees the IRS took testimony about the
maze of tax penalties that Americans may encounter.
   These penalties range from $1 for failing to file a statement on
dividends paid, to 25 percent of the tax owed for failing to pay on
time, to $10,000 for helping a corporation understate its tax
liability.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs and O. Donaldson Chapoton,
assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, pledged support
for the subcommittee's investigation into whether the number of
penalties should be reduced and enforcement changed.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee, vowed a
change. ``We've created some sort of a monster here,'' he said.
   He noted IRS statistics that in 1987, the agency assessed 27
million penalties totaling over $14 billion and waived 4 million
totaling $4 billion.
   Pryor cited one business that underpaid employment taxes by 2
cents and was hit with a penalty for $400.29.
   Gibbs noted that many of the levies were enacted by Congress
over the past seven years in an effort to increase compliance with
the tax laws.
   ``A penalty system that operates based on the wrong principles
may provide appropriate sanctions for some types of behavior and
yet have an overall negative impact on taxpayer behavior because it
is not perceived as fair,'' he said.
   Chapoton rejected allegations that the IRS is stiffening penalty
enforcement primarily to raise revenue, rather than improve
compliance.
   ``We certainly hope there's not any reaction ... by IRS agents
in the field ... that penalties should be used as means of raising
revenue,'' he said.
   The University of Akron study found that instructions for 1040EZ
_ the simplest tax form _ require an 8.45 grade reading level,
compared with a grade level of 7.1 for the Wall Street Journal.
   The study concluded that the penalty system is especially
onerous for lower-income Americans because in many instances they
are not even aware of the need to comply.
   Because Congress has not given the IRS sufficient guidance, said
Childs, penalties often are applied to taxpayers who have neither
the money to hire a lawyer or accountant nor knowledge of how the
system works.
   ``The low-income taxpayer has about as much knowledge of how to
obtain abatement of a penalty through problems resolution (the IRS'
``consumer advocate'') as he or she does of getting to the moon,''
said Childs.
   ``Abuses by high-income taxpayers have brought about a plethora
of new penalties. Unfortunately, the low-income taxpayer has been
caught in this net.''
   The university used a textbook-grading formula and statistics
from the Department of Education to gauge the reading skill
required to understand instructions for filling out tax forms 1040
and 1040EZ, which generally are simpler than an IRS notice of
deficiency. Sufficient skills were possessed by:
   _19.8 percent of blacks.
   _37 percent of Hispanics.
   _11 percent of those with less than a high school education.
   _22 percent of high school graduates.
   _50.2 percent of those with less than two years of college.
   _82.8 percent of those with at least two years of post-secondary
education.

   The Tunisian Embassy denies reports that
terrorist Abu Nidal is living in Tunis despite claims that he moved
there after the Polish government shut down an arms export business
operated by his associates.
   Embassy spokesman Oussama Romdhani said Monday there ``is no
reason to suggest the existence of any ties whatsoever between
Tunisia and the Abu Nidal group,'' which is blamed for numerous
terrorist incidents, including December 1985 attacks on the Rome
and Vienna airports
   The Polish government announced in January that it had closed
down an arms export business run out of Warsaw by Abu Nidal
associates, and East European sources said they believed that Abu
Nidal had gone to Tunis.
   State Department sources said that according to their
information, Abu Nidal has resided mainly in Tripoli, Libya, since
leaving Warsaw in 1985.
   ``But someone like Abu Nidal is on the move all the time, for
business and security reasons,'' said one State Department source.
The State Department had no reason to believe that Abu Nidal
operated out of Tunis, the U.S. official said.

<TEXT>
   Israeli authorities
today banned Palestinians from traveling between the occupied
territories, and hundreds of people rioted after a nightly curfew
on the 650,000 Arabs in the Gaza Strip.
   Hospital officials said troops shot dead one Arab and wounded
five today during clashes on the West Bank. No injuries were
reported in the rioting in the Gaza Strip.
   In Jerusalem, police spokesman Rafi Levy said seven of 90 Arab
polie officers had quit. They were the first such resignations in
the disputed Israeli capital.
   Their action came after 500 Arab police in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip heeded a call by underground Palestinian activists to
turn in their badges.
   On the West Bank, a general strike called for by the Palestine
Liberation Organization got under way with transportation halted
and Arab-owned stores closed.
   The travel ban between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
represented an effort by the Israeli army to stem the growing
campaign against Israeli occupation inspired by PLO.
   An official of the military's Civil Administration said the
measure applied to traffic in both directions. He said exemptions
would be issued for hardship cases.
   ``They are allowed to work in Israel, but they can't continue
into Judea and Samaria or vice versa. They would be turned back at
a checkpoint,'' said the official, using the biblical terms for the
West Bank.
   ``The policy is not to separate (the Palestinians), but to make
it more difficult for agitators to move and to help stop
distribution of anti-Israeli pamphlets that cause incitement,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ban was the most comprehensive travel restriction imposed
since Israel seized the areas in the 1967 Middle East War. Under
Israeli law, Palestinians are allowed into Israel to work but must
have police authorization to spend the night.
   The Israeli military also said it would to take punitive actions
against foreign and local journalists it believed had filed false
reports about incidents in the occupied territories. Army officers
declined to elaborate, saying a statement would be released later.
   Officials at Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital said a 22-year-old
Palestinian from the West Bank village of Ain Yabrud was dead on
arrival with a bullet wound to the jaw. The Arab-owned Palestine
Press Service identified the dead man as Arafat Hweih and said he
was shot during a demonstration in Deir Jarir, 9 miles northeast of
Ramallah.
   Troops also shot and wounded four Palestinians in Qalqilya, 16
miles west of Nablus on the West Bank, officials at Qalqilya
Hospital said. The Press Service put the wounded at six and said
two were women shot in the head.
   The army said it imposed a curfew on Qalqilya.
   In Ramallah, thick black smoke from burning tires rose above
several neighborhoods. At least three handcuffed Palestinians were
detained by troops and sitting on the ground in the Ramallah police
station.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army imposed a 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew
over the entire coastal territory following the resignation of 300
Arab policemen.
   Soldiers at the Erez checkpoint, the main entrance leading into
the Gaza Strip, turned back Arab residents during the curfew, which
was imposed without advance notice. Journalists saw 15 to 20 cars
turned back in the first hour.
   After the curfew was lifted for the day, soldiers fired tear gas
at hundreds of Arabs who threw stones at an army administrative
office in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. No injuries
were reported.
   Army officers said the nightly curfew, which forces Arabs to
stay in their homes, would keep Arab agitators from entering the
Gaza Strip and provoking demonstrations.
   Israel radio today said 300 Arab police in Gaza City had also
resigned. They joined 450 officers in the occupied lands who turned
in their badges earlier following orders of PLO-inspired
underground leaflets. The radio said that 40 officers who had
handed in their resignations in the West Bank city of Hebron
continued working after local Arab leaders asked them to stay on.
   About 850 Arab policemen work in the occupied territories.
   In response to months of PLO-backed unrest in the occupied
lands, Israel stepped up economic sanctions. Shipment of gasoline
and other fuel to service stations in the West Bank was banned as
of Sunday.
   According to United Nations figures, at least 91 Palestinians
have been killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8.

<HEAD>Vietnam Investigating 29 Cases Possibly Involving Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam says it is investigating 29
cases that may involve Americans listed as missing in action from
the Vietnam War, U.S. military experts said today upon returning
from Hanoi.
   Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, made the announcement following four days of
what he called ``positive and productive'' talks with Vietnamese
officials.
   ``The Vietnamese told us they are investigating 29 instances
where they have received information, material or remains,'' he
said in a statement. ``But they said it will take at least three
weeks for them to draw any conclusions from these investigations or
to have remains to repatriate.''
   He said the U.S. team provided new information to the Vietnamese
government, emphasizing cases mentioned by U.S. presidential
emissary and retired Gen. John W. Vessey during his mission to
Hanoi last August.
   Vessey had asked the Vietnamese to accelerate progress on
resolving 70 ``discrepancy cases,'' in which the United States says
there is strong evidence that Vietnamese officials know what
happened to the missing men. The evidence includes photographs of
the men taken after their capture.
   In all, nearly 1,800 Americans remain unaccounted for from the
war in Vietnam, which ended in April 1975 with a communist victory
over the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government. Progress on the
issue has been slow principally because the United States does not
have diplomatic ties with the Vietnamese government.
   Harvey said the U.S. team also visited a site near the major
northern port of Haiphong where a U.S. aircraft had crashed.
Haiphong, over which U.S. planes flew intense bombing runs during
the war, is about 60 miles southeast of Hanoi.
   The team was composed of six experts from the center and the
Army Central Identification Laboratory. The laboratory and the
casualty resolution center, both based in Hawaii, are entrusted
with resolving the fates of America's wartime missing.
   It was the fourth round of technical talks since Vietnam told
Vessey during his visit that it would end months of deadlock and
resume cooperation on the MIA issue.
   For its part of the agreement, Washington has on four occasions
sent medical teams into Vietnam to study how war-disabled
Vietnamese and other humanitarian cases could benefit from private
U.S. assistance. There is an embargo on official aid because of
Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia.
   Vietnam has returned remains it believes are those of Americans
three times since the Vessey agreement.
   The last repatriation came on March 2, when it handed over 17
sets in a ceremony at Hanoi Airport along with reports on three
other missing U.S. soldiers. It was the largest turnover in two
years and the fourth largest since the end of the war.

<DATELINE>SWITZER, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy who had been left alone
after school shot and killed two men as they tried to steal a
videocassette recorder from his family's home, police said.
   Danny Ray Abernathy, 35, and Broadus Petty, 39, both of
Spartanburg, were found dead at the house Monday afternoon.
Officers were searching for a third person they suspect may have
been involved.
   William Todd Knight, the son of Billy and Ann Knight, ``acted
very wisely,'' said Spartanburg County Coroner Jim Burnett. ``His
life was in danger, he looked for an escape and could not find one
... he was a very brave young man.''
   Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Capt. John Blackwood
said the boy was watching cartoons in his parents' bedroom Monday
afternoon when he heard noises at the front door of the family's
brick, ranch-style home.
   Todd told officers he was scared, so he went to his room for the
.22-caliber rifle his father had given him for Christmas and loaded
four rounds.
   He then went to the front door and saw a man he described as
``rough'' pounding on the door. The man finally left in a white
Datsun.
   Todd said he resumed watching cartoons and about 10 minutes
later heard more banging, this time at a dining room window.
   He saw two men climbing through the dining room window. The boy
said he went into the bathroom to climb out the window, but saw the
white Datsun was parked in the back yard.
   Todd told police he went back to the hallway, peeked around the
corner into the den and was spotted by one of the intruders as they
were taking the VCR.
   Todd then fired three rounds at the men, who dropped the VCR and
fled.
   When police arrived, one of the dead men was found face down
next to a woodpile in the back yard, approximately 50 to 75 feet
from the house, while the second man was in the driver's seat of
the white two-door Datsun.
   Todd's parents both work and his sister had gone to a school
activity with plans to be home in about an hour, said Blackwood.

<HEAD>Ice Chunk Probably Killed Prince Charles' Friend, Pathologist Said</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British army officer killed in an avalanche that
nearly engulfed his friend, Prince Charles, most likely died from a
chunk of ice that crashed down a Swiss mountainside, an inquest was
told today.
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a 34-year-old career army officer, died of a
single blow to the head and probably was standing when he was
struk, Dr. Esha Sarvesvaran, a pathologist, testified.
   The pathologist told Hammersmith Coroner's Court that the blow
fractured Lindsay's skull and caused severe bleeding. He said the
object that struck Lindsay probably was a lump of ice.
   Lindsay, Charles and others were skiing in Switzerland on
Thursday off of a main trail at Klosters when the avalanche broke
loose. Charles and other members of the party skiied clear but
Lindsay was caught in the avalanche. Another friend, Patti
Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered broken legs and lung injuries.
   Coroner John Burton, who presided over the inquest, said he
wanted to dispel speculation that Lindsay suffocated in the snow.
   Lindsay is to be cremated after a funeral Thursday at the Royal
Military College at Sandhurst.
   Burton adjourned the inquest until an unspecified date while a
Swiss examining magistrate completes his inquiries.
   ``If it proves necessary to seek further evidence, then that
would be taken from those who can give the most helpful evidence,''
Burton said, reading from a statement. ``That is the only
consideration when one decides which witnesses one might call.''
   He said nothing about whether Prince Charles, the 39-year-old
heir to the British throne, might be summoned to testify.

   A passenger bus rolled into the Kumar
River and sank as it was attempting to board a ferry, and more than
50 people were feared drowned, news reports said today.
   Newspapers said about 60 passengers were believed to be on the
bus, which was en route from the southern town of Barisal to Dhaka.
They quoted witnesses as saying only seven people jumped or swam to
safety after the accident Monday night.
   The Janata, a Bengali-language daily, said the bus' brakes
apparently failed. It said the driver and two assistants were among
the missing.
   A senior police official at Madaripur said in a telephone
interview today that five bodies had been recovered. ``Some more
bodies might have been trapped inside the bus,'' he added.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
rescue work was hampered by a lack of equipment. He said that the
Dhaka fire department had been asked to rush cranes and other
equipment to the scene.

<HEAD>Three Junior High Students Expelled For Coffee Poisoning Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST LAKE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three students accused of putting a
foreign substance into a school official's coffee in an attempt to
poison him have been expelled for the rest of the school year,
school officials say.
   The school board took the action Monday after two of the
students, girls in the seventh and ninth grades at Forest Lake
Southwest Junior High School, waived their right to hearings.
   The other student, a ninth-grade girl, had insisted on a closed
hearing, which was held March 10 before a state hearing examiner.
The examiner recommended that she be expelled, and the board
accepted the recommendation.
   All three girls have been accused in Washington County Juvenile
Court of conspiracy to commit murder.
   They're accused of putting a foreign substance into vice
principal Robert Espelien's coffee cup on Feb. 25. Espelien said he
became suspicious when he saw a ``brownish-tan substance'' floating
at the top of the cup and had it sent to a medical lab for analysis.
   The substance put in the coffee has not been revealed.
   Forest Lake District Superintendent Gerald Brynildson said the
students are entitled to return to school next fall unless the
expulsion is extended. Until then, the district is required to
provide tutors.

<HEAD>`Bowery Boys' Producer Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Grippo, who in the 1940s and 1950s
produced nearly two dozen ``Bowery Boys'' movies, has died at the
age of 81.
   The New York native produced at least 23 films featuring the
band of impish juvenile delinquents, whose ranks included wise guy
Leo Gorcey and his naive patsy, Huntz Hall.
   Grippo died Saturday at a Los Angeles hospital.
   Although the ``Bowery Boys'' started off as troublemakers in the
films ``Dead End'' and ``Angels With Dirty Faces,'' it was Grippo,
as their agent, who cleaned them up for their popular series.
   ``Jan wanted them to get into trouble, but to be good kids at
heart,'' said his wife, Paula Grippo.
   Born in Beacon, N.Y., Grippo began his career as a cartoonist
for the New York Herald-Tribune Syndicate. He came to Hollywood in
1937 to become an agent.
   During World War II, Grippo was active with the Hollywood
Canteen, a gathering place for those in the military.
   A magician by hobby, he was a member of both the Society of
American Magicians and the Academy of Magical Arts and often
practiced at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.
   Grippo is survived by his wife, three brothers, James, Michael
and Henry, and a sister, Bertha DeLucca.

<TEXT>
   A Swiss oilman involved in a failed Iraqi oil
pipeline plan says a friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III
tried to bypass the U.S. State Department by attempting to get
Meese's help on the project.
   Bruce Rappaport also said Monday he had been ready to give
Israel a third of his profits from the $1 billion project in return
for an Israeli promise not to bomb the pipeline to Jordan, which
would have passed near the Israeli border.
   Speaking in Hebrew on Israel television, Rappaport denied
allegations he offered a bribe to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
then prime minister, in return for a promise not to attack the
pipeline.
   The pipeline project was prompted by Iraq's war with Iran. Iraq
backed out of the project because it was not satisfied with
security arrangements.
   On Sept. 19, 1985 Peres wrote a letter to Meese saying Israel
would not bomb the pipeline, and Meese's friend, E. Robert Wallach,
took charge of organizing meetings with officials in Washington,
Rappaport said.
   ``He (Wallach) apparently approached and told me: `Look, if Mr.
Peres confirms the (assurances) to Mr. Meese, then we will arrange
such a meeting, and it will go up to the president' and so on,''
Rappaport said.
   ``What I understand now is that the intention then was to bypass
the U.S. State Department,'' Rappaport said.
   He was not clear in the interview exactly what the meetings in
Washington were about.
   ``Wallach understood that if we want to receive support for such
a guarantee which Israel has no possibility or need to give ... and
we had an alternative agreement with large insurance companies,
with a group of bankers, with individuals, so if this had to pass
through the Senate, the Congress or the State Department it would
not come into being,'' he said.
   He said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq feared for his life if
Israel bombed the pipeline and in meetings Hussein demanded a $400
million guarantee no bombing would occur.
   Rappaport said he received the guarantee from the Overseas
Private Investment Corp., a U.S. government-run export company,
while Israel was asked to provide ``a moral guarantee.''
   At that stage, Rappaport said, he was introduced to Wallach, who
organized a meeting with then-National Security Council head Robert
McFarlane.
   ``He (McFarlane) was very excited to get all possible assistance
for ... Israel,'' he said.
   A memo by Wallach says that on Oct. 16, 1985, Meese, Peres and
Wallach had a ``three-way discussion'' of the project at the
Israeli Embassy in Washington. On Sunday, James Rocap, one of
Meese's lawyers, said Wallach's account ``totally exaggerates'' the
discussion.
   Rappaport said he was first told of the pipeline project in
September 1984. He said he met in Israel with Peres, who confirmed
the Jewish state had no intention to bomb the pipeline.
   He said he also met with representatives of the San-Francisco
based Bechtel Group Inc., which was to build the pipeline.
   Rappaport said he had been prepared to give Israel $60 million
to $70 million a year, or a third of his profits from the project,
over a 10-year period.
   Wallach wrote a memo to Meese saying that of $65 million to $70
million a year over 10 years which Rappaport was going to funnel to
Israel, some would go to Peres' Labor Party, although that would be
``denied everywhere.''
   As a result, U.S. independent counsel James McKay is
investigating in Washington whether Meese, Wallach, Rappaport and
others conspired to pay an illegal bribe to a foreign official _
that is, Peres and his party.
   McKay is trying to determine if Meese was simply passing a
problem on to the appropriate official _ as Meese's lawyers say _
when he referred Wallach to McFarlane in May 1985, or if he was
aiding a conspiracy to get funds for the guarantee despite
opposition from the State Department and Overseas Private
Investment Corp.
   Whatever he heard from Meese, Wallach and Rappaport, McFarlane
endorsed the idea and assigned an aide to work on it while keeping
progress of the proposal secret from the State Department.

<TEXT>
   Public school Superintendent Leonard Britton
abruptly withdrew a districtwide plan for year-round schools by
July 1989, conceding there wasn't enough support from the school
board.
   ``Frankly, it is very late to place the entire school district
on a new calendar in July 1989,'' Britton said Monday, just before
the seven-member board was to vote on the proposal.
   The board earlier had agreed to the July 1989 date, but tabled
it last October after a fiery public outcry. The district adopted a
policy two years ago phasing in year-round schooling for all
students by the 1991-92 school year.
   Those in favor of the proposal said it would ease overcrowding
by putting some students in classes during the usually idle summer
months. They also said it would provide educational advantages such
as better retention of information.
   Currently about one-quarter of Los Angeles Unified School
District students, those in the most crowded schools, are on
year-round schedules. Proponents say the selective policy is
unfair, especially to the minorities who account for most of the
student population.
   Critics say year-round schools disrupt family vacations and
students' summer jobs, make child care more difficult and force
some students to spend summer days in hot, antiquated rooms.
   Britten said the district will still aim for a year-round
schedule, but he admitted a majority of the current seven-member
school board may never agree.

   Avalanches caused by heavy rain and snow
buried homes and blocked roads in the northern state of Kashmir,
killing 66 people in six villages, news reports said today.
   The United News of India quoted official reports as saying that
49 people died Monday in two villages in Kargil District, about 90
miles northeast of the state's capital of Srinagar.
   The other deaths occurred in four other Kashmiri villages since
Saturday, the agency said.
   Snowstorms and rains hit the mountain states on Thursday,
triggering landslides that blocked highways. Over 5,000 motorists
were stranded, United News quoted state officials as saying.
   Indian Air Force aircraft were called in to help with rescue
operations and to fly some stranded passengers to other regions, it
said.

   The Afghanistan peace talks reached a Soviet-set
target date today but the U.N. mediator, citing difficult issues
still to be resolved, said negotiations will continue.
   ``We are discussing very serious, difficult issues but we
continue to negotiate and look for solutions,'' said U.N. mediator
Diego Cordovez.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has said that if an agreement
was reached by March 15, Moscow's estimated 115,000 troops would
start leaving Afghanistan by mid-May.
   Neither side in the negotiations, which resumed today, has said
the deadline was a rigid one or that the Soviets would consider
going back on their pledge to withdraw their troops if the deadline
passed without an agreement.
   But in Moscow today, the Soviets said failure to meet the
deadline will delay the start of a Soviet troop withdrawal.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said there was
only a ``slim'' chance the accords could be signed by the end of
the day. He blamed the situation on Pakistan's insistence that a
coalition government be formed in Kabul before the agreement was
reached.
   He accused Pakistan of ``procrastination'' in the negotiations
in an attempt to arrange a post-war government to its liking.
   Pakistan has said it wants a transitional government in Kabul
before the Soviets begin their withdrawal to oversee the Soviet
pullout and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million refugees
from Pakistan and Iran.
   Moscow and Kabul say Afghanistan should decide the makeup of its
future government after the settlement is signed.
   The current round of talks, now three weeks old, has completed
all main elements of the settlement aimed at ending nine years of
fighting.
   Those elements include the timetable and basic logistics of the
pullout of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops, an issue that has
eluded a solution for several years.
   Sources close to the talks, who declined to be identified, said
on Monday the Pakistanis also have reservations about some minor
points in the complex agreement package.
   The sources said Pakistan received a new Kremlin message during
the weekend, urging it to sign the settlement without delay.
   Unconfirmed reports quoted Pakistan's Prime Minister Mohammad
Khan Junejo as saying that a decision on whether it would sign
would be announced Monday. But there was no official word by
nightfall. Pakistan's Cabinet has held three meetings since Sunday,
apparently to weigh its next step.
   Meanwhile, the fragile seven-party Alliance of Moslem guerrillas
failed to decide whether it would drop its demand to dominate a
future Afghan government.
   A guerrilla leader said on Monday in Pakistan that Moscow again
rejected direct talks with the Moslem rebels on the Afghan issue.
The resistance is represented by Pakistan in the Geneva talks but
its position has not always been identical with Pakistan's.
   The guerrillas have started to form a government of their own
which Pakistan considers too hard-line.
   The Soviet Union began sending troops to Afghanistan in December
1979 at the request of the pro-Moscow government. The Soviet troops
and the Kabul government's regular army of about 50,000 men are
pitted against 200,000 Moslem rebels, supported by the United
States, China and Pakistan.

   A protester who wanted to dramatize his
cause by spending a week in a garbage can dangling from the Golden
Gate Bridge fell 220 feet into the icy water and was nearly washed
out to sea.
   Paul Alarab, 29, of Kensington, Calif., suffered collapsed lungs
and three broken ribs but was listed in satisfactory condition at
Letterman Army Medical Center following Monday's rescue.
   He was plucked from a rock by the Coast Guard nine hours after
the fall.
   ``He's lucky,'' said his brother, Chris Alarab. ``Now he has a
second chance to give his message.''
   Paul Alarab said he wanted to draw attention to the plight of
the old and infirm by living for a week in a plastic garbage can
suspended from the bridge.
   He complained that the elderly must stand in long lines in
supermarkets and banks and are neglected by young people, the
California Highway Patrol said.
   Alarab had equipped the 33-gallon garbage can with clothing, two
jugs of water, a life vest and some political pamphlets, the CHP
said.
   Alarab said he lowered the can, attached to the bridge railing
by 60 feet of nylon rope, Sunday night and was shinnying down when
he fell.
   The CHP was called to the scene but found only the swaying
plastic barrel. Fearing it was a bomb, authorities closed the
bridge for 40 minutes.
   Monday morning a fishing boat reported a man clinging to a rock
near Point Diablo, on the ocean side of the bridge's north end.
   Highway patrol officials said they will seek a trespassing
charge against Alarab when he is discharged from the hospital. His
brother said Alarab has been unemployed for six months.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam today buried Premier Pham Hung
after eulogizing him as a dedicated revolutionary who defied
torture and harsh battlefields in a 60-year struggle for the
communist cause.
   Guerrillas fighting Vietnam's nine-year occupation of Cambodia
called Hung ``a notorious murderer'' who brought widespread
suffering to Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Hung, who played a key role in defeating the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government and rose to the No. 2 position in the Communist
Party hierarchy, was buried in Hanoi after dying of a heart attack
last Thursday. He was 75.
   Vietnamese radio reports said Communist party chief Nguyen Van
Linh and other top party officials carried Hung's casket from the
Ba Dinh conference hall to a gun carriage for the trip to Mai Dich
cemetery, the final resting place of Vietnam's revolutionary
leaders.
   Tens of thousands of mourners lined the six-mile route of the
carriage, flanked by two rows of armed military honor guards, said
the reports monitored in Bangkok.
   The radio of the Khmer Rouge, the main anti-Vietnamese guerrilla
group, said Hung died ``as one who brought endless misery and
suffering on Vietnam and on the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.''
   The broadcast, a text of which was seen in Bangkok today, said
Vietnam's leaders should rethink the line adopted by Hung and
Communist Party chief Le Duan, who died in July 1986.
   Hung died while Vietnamese forces were ``almost choking to death
from their attempt to swallow Cambodia,'' the broadcast on Sunday
said. Vietnam's economy has ``hit rock bottom,'' and the country is
internationally isolated, it said.
   Vo Van Kiet, a vice premier and head of state economic planning,
has been chosen acting premier to replace Hung.
   Linh and Kiet are regarded by Western analysts as the country's
leading proponents of Western-style reforms which the party has
deemed crucial to overcome the nation's economic crisis.

   Convicted murderer Willie Jasper Darden, who
maintained his innocence through 14 years on death row and became
the focus of an international debate on capital punishment, was
executed today in Florida's electric chair.
   Darden, 54, was convicted of fatally shooting Lakeland
businessman James C. Turman while robbing his wife of $15 in
September 1973.
   ``I was not guilty for the charge for which I was arrested and
this morning I tell you I am not guilty of the charge for which I
am about to be executed,'' Darden said in a final statement to 30
witnesses in the death chamber.
   ``I go this morning with a clear conscience. I bear no guilt.
I'm at peace with myself, with the world, with each of you. God
bless you.''
   Darden winked and nodded at one of his attorneys just before the
hood was put over his head, and was declared dead at 7:12 a.m.
after 2,000 volts of electricity flowed through his body for two
minutes. Two puffs of smoke rose from his right leg where one of
the electrodes was attached.
   Darden's case attracted worldwide attention, including pleas for
clemency Nobel peace prize winner Andrei Sakharov and other human
rights activists. They said Darden was railroaded because he was
black and the victim was white.
   Earlier today, Wayne Robert Felde was executed in Louisiana's
electric chair for the 1978 murder of a policeman.
   It was the first time two inmates were executed the same day in
the United States since Aug. 28, when three murderers were put to
death, in Florida, Alabama and Utah.
   Darden spent 14 years on death row, one month less than Howard
V. Douglas, who has been on death row in Florida since December
1973.
   Darden refused his last meal this morning, said prison spokesman
Bob Macmaster. By 6 a.m., Darden had showered, and his head and
lower right leg were shaved to facilitate the flow of electricity,
the spokesman said.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, a federal judge and the state Supreme Court rejected
Darden's appeals.
   His last hope was a reprieve from Gov. Bob Martinez, who signed
Darden's seventh black-bordered death warrant last week and said
Monday he had no plans to issue a stay.
   ``I think of the victim at a moment like this and the family
which was destroyed,'' Martinez said. ``A hideous murder took place
and that's what I keep in mind. Just because it's 15 years later,
that doesn't reduce a crime that was committed at the time.''
   ``The governor's hands are now stained with the blood of a man
from whom justice was withheld,'' Amnesty International said in a
statement from John G. Healey, executive director of Amnesty
International USA in New York.
   Early today, about 40 people gathered in a cow pasture across
from the Florida State Prison to protest the execution.
   The opponents maintained silence after 7 a.m. while the
execution took place, then began singing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``I think it's long overdue. He did it to himself. I'm just
thinking right now I want some peace of mind ... it's been a long
time and I'm glad it's finally over,'' said Turman's widow, Helen
Turman Baum, minutes after the execution. Mrs. Baum has remarried
since the shooting.
   Darden went into Turman's furniture store on September 8, 1973,
and had just robbed Turman's wife of $15 when Turman came on the
scene.
   Court records say that after shooting Turman between the eyes,
Darden unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants and ordered his
wife to get on the floor, remove her false teeth and perform oral
sex on him while Turman lay dying just a few feet away.
   A neighbor, Philip Arnold, also identified Darden during the
trial. Arnold, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing
the shooting and the woman's cries. He was shot three times but
survived.
   Darden became the 18th person executed in the state and the 96th
executed in the nation since the Supreme Court restored capital
punishment in 1976.
   Death penalty opponents, led by Amnesty International, have said
Darden had an alibi to prove his innocence. They claim there is
evidence _ statements from a minister and a woman _ that Darden
could not have committed the murder.
   In Sweden, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the
U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, urging Florida to commute Darden's death
sentence.
   Martinez rejected appeals on Darden's behalf by Sakharov,
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, actress Margot
Kidder and others.
   Jon Peck, a spokesman for Martinez, said Pope John Paul II,
through Florida-based Roman Catholic leaders, has expressed
concerns in the past about Florida death cases, but never Darden's
specifically.
   Ray McDaniel, who prosecuted Darden for the Turman killing said
Friday, ``There is no question he is guilty.''
   Then-Gov. Bob Graham signed Darden's first death warrant in 1979
on the same day as a warrant for John Spenkelink, the first man
electrocuted in Florida after the state resumed the death penalty.
   Darden was born in Snow Hill, N.C., the second of four children.
He graduated from high school in Greene County, N.C. His conviction
record dated to 1964 and included breaking and entering and
attempted rape.
   Douglas, at 51 the man who has spent the longest time on death
row, was convicted of the July 1973 shooting death of his former
lover's husband in Polk County.
   His first death warrant resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court
sending the case back in 1984. He was resentenced to death and the
case is now pending on appeal.

   Five men were pulled from a sinking boat
this morning about 50 miles into the Atlantic Ocean off Georgetown,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   The 54-foot-long Willie Victor, based in Murrells Inlet, radioed
the Coast Guard Monday night saying it was taking on water and a
Coast Guard helicopter was dispatched from Savannah, Ga., said a
Coast Guard spokesman in Miami.
   The helicopter arrived shortly after midnight and the men were
lifted into the helicopter after Coast Guard pumps could not save
the boat. The boat sank about 20 minutes later, the spokesmen said.
   The boat's owner and operator, Gerald Baston, suffered head
injuries, and another man, Tommy Morehead, suffered a broken leg,
the spokesmen said. The other men were identified as Neal Baston,
Art Ashworth and Dennis Barrios.
   The Coast Guard did not know the men's ages or hometowns.

   At least four people were killed and
more than 90 injured today during an opposition-sponsored strike to
demand the resignation of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   The strike closed offices and businesses in six of India's
states but failed to achieve widespread support in the other 17
states.
   At least three people were killed and several others were hurt
in street clashes in Bihar state, United News of India said.
Violence also was reported in neighboring West Bengal state, where
at least 75 people were reported injured.
   In Kerala state, the news agency reported a youth was killed and
seven other people injured when a flour mill operator opened fire
at opposition party supporters attacking his mill near the coastal
city of Ernakulam.
   United News also said 14 police were injured near the Pakistan
border in Rajasthan state when they were pelted with stones while
trying to remove roadblocks.
   The strike disrupted normal life in Bombay, India's business
center, and in Calcutta, the country's largest city. But it drew
little response in the capital at New Delhi, where most businesses
remained open.
   United News of India said police arrested at least 3,000 people
from various cities for attempting to block traffic and close shops.
   But the opposition coalition that called the strike said at
least 150,000 people were arrested. In a statement in New Delhi,
the eight parties maintained the strike was complete in all major
towns and industrial areas.
   The strike was called by most major opposition parties to
protest sectarian violence, rising prices and alleged corruption in
government. The parties, which include two communist groups, demand
that Parliament be dissolved and new elections held.
   In Parliament, proceedings were disrupted for more than an hour
when opposition members raised anti-government slogans in the upper
house. Earlier, the entire opposition boycotted the first hour of
business in both houses in support of the strike.
   On Monday, at least 25,000 people were arrested in the southern
state of Tamil Nadu and 500 others in Orissa in the east in what
police said was a move to pre-empt violence during today's strike.
   Opposition members in Parliament today criticized the government
for Monday's arrests, United News of India said.
   Gandhi's Congress Party holds more than 400 of the 542 seats in
the popularly elected lower house of Parliament. The rest are
divided among opposition parties which have failed to act jointly
despite common demands that Gandhi resign.

   A Marine amateur boxer was in critical but
stable condition today after he was injured during the Armed Forces
Boxing Championships here, officials said.
   Lance Cpl. Rickey Uzzel, 22, of Austin, Texas, was in the
intensive care unit at San Diego Naval Hospital, hospital officials
said this morning.
   Uzzel was under sedation and was stable after receiving therapy
to reduce pressure on his brain, said Lt. Pat Killy, hospital
spokeswoman.
   Navy and other military officials were not available for comment
Monday about the injury, a spokeswoman said.
   The Marine was knocked out Thursday during the
light-middleweight championship match with James Crisp, an Army
boxer who last fall was ranked eighth by the USA Amateur Boxing
Federation in the 156-pound class.
   The injury occurred during 23 seconds into the second round of a
three-round match.
   Last year, boxing matches here among recruits were stopped after
an 18-year-old died.

<TEXT>
   A grand jury has indicted Mayor John Fedo
on 23 charges including theft, falsifying expense records and
attempting to obstruct the state auditor.
   The indictment, made public Monday after the mayor's arraignment
in State District Court, included 22 felony charges.
   Fedo, 37, said the charges were a political ploy arranged by
people who don't like him. The indictment, he said, ``is not going
to have an effect on City Hall.''
   If convicted, Fedo, 37, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison on the theft charge and up to five years in prison on most
of the other charges. Fedo was freed on his own recognizance and
scheduled to appear in court May 3, when a judge will determine
whether enough evidence exists to proceed to trial.
   His lawyer, Douglas Sauter, said he will move for dismissal of
the charges. Fedo was ``tried once in the election and found not
guilty,'' he said.
   Fedo, a member of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, won
his first four-year term as mayor in 1979 and has been re-elected
twice.
   The theft charge concerns $13,500 given to Fedo by three
businessmen to lobby for state funds for a convention center in the
city.
   During the 1987 election campaign, Fedo said he passed the funds
to an unnamed Twin Cities businessman in 1985 in exchange for
information about other cities' convention center proposals.
   But prosecutors say the mayor played a limited role in lobbying
for a convention center he later claimed to have won almost
single-handedly.
   Duluth, a city of 85,000 on the western tip of Lake Superior,
was never in competition for the $200 million convention center for
which Bloomington and Minneapolis vied, the charges say. The State
Legislature awarded Duluth a total of $17.2 million for its own,
relatively small center.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York wrote in an
Israeli newspaper today that television cameras should be barred
from the occupied territories.
   In a signed column published in the Jerusalem Post, Koch said
that in view of what is happening elsewhere in the world, Israel
would be justified in taking steps to bar TV crews from the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   ``Many other nations throughout the world are experiencing
troubles similar to those now taking place in Israel. Should Israel
be the only nation to allow full television coverage of these
troubles?
   ``This creates a false impression in the minds of television
viewers that such events are happening only in Israel,'' wrote
Koch, a longtime supporter of Israel.
   More than 90 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire
and beatings in riots that started Dec. 8 in the territories
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. The territories are
home to 1.5 million Palestinians.
   Koch said he thought Israel should use whatever force necessary
to put down the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands.
   The mayor also criticized U.S. editorial writers and columnists
for their ``relentless drumbeat of criticism against Israel.''
   He added that he had attacked U.S. involvement in the Vietnam
War but now had ``second thoughts'' about the wisdom of deserting
South Vietnamese allies.
   ``It's easy for columnists, and for all of us, to play God with
the lives of other people, endanger them and leave them ultimately
to be destroyed,'' he wrote.

   Passengers spent longer than they bargained for
today in the world's longest undersea tunnel, which opened to
trains two days earlier.
   A power outage left them stranded for more than three hours 460
feet underground in the 37-mile-long Seikan Tunnel.
   The tunnel links Japan's largest island, Honshu, with Hokkaido,
the northernmost main island. It cuts two hours off a trip formerly
made by ferry.
   It took 24 years to build at an estimated cost of $8.5 billion.
   Most of the 166 passengers were asleep when the outage halted
their 11-coach express train, bound for Tokyo from Sapporo, about
12 miles from the tunnel's south exit. A locomotive pulled the
train from the tunnel, and it resumed its journey from the next
station, at Aomori, 3 hours and 50 minutes behind schedule, a
Hokkaido Rail Japan Co. spokesman said.
   The cause of the power outage was under investigation, said the
Hokkaido representative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Six trains have been stopped by faulty fire detectors since the
tunnel opened.

   The Baltimore city sheriff, who is facing
charges of election law violations, has been accused of trying to
bribe the investigator handling the case by handing him $1,000 at a
fast food restaurant.
   Sheriff Shelton Stewart, 45, was indicted by a Baltimore County
grand jury on charges of offering a bribe to a public officer and
obstruction of justice, county State's Attorney Sandra A. O'Connor
said Monday.
   Stewart surrendered to county police and was released on his own
recognizance after a bail hearing before a District Court
commissioner.
   A spokesman for the sheriff's office declined to comment.
   Frank C. Meyer, an assistant state's attorney and chief of the
office's investigations division, said Stewart could be sentenced
to up to 15 years in prison and fined $15,000 if convicted of the
latest charges.
   Meyer said the grand jury saw videotapes made by county police
of meetings Thursday and Friday between the sheriff and James
Cabezas, the chief investigator for the state prosecutor's office.
   Cabezas was investigating Stewart for alleged violations of
state election laws in his 1986 campaign for sheriff. Meyer
contends that Stewart was trying to influence the outcome of that
case.
   Stewart has been charged with perjury, conspiracy to violate
state election laws and a violation of election law following an
investigation into accusations that he failed to report a
significant amount of campaign contributions.
   Stewart has denied any campaign irregularities.

   President Reagan is planning to name an
interagency committee to develop an administration consensus on how
to avoid another stock market crash, a White House official said
today.
   ``It's not another study; the studies have been done,'' the
official said. Instead, he said, the group would pull together the
ideas of various studies already completed and then develop a
consolidated position.
   The group will be headed by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III and include officials from the Federal Reserve Board, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Its report will be due within 60 to 90 days.
   Studies on the crash have been produced by a presidential task
force headed by former Sen. Nicholas F. Brady, as well as by the
SEC, the CFTC and markets.
   ``We've been looking at these reports and each of them is a
little different,'' said the official, who declined to be
identified. ``The idea of this group is to decide what can be done
... to reach a consensus among the regulatory agencies.''
   The official said that while legislative action may be needed
eventually, ``the main goal will be to see what they (the
regulatory agencies) can do under existing authorities.''

   A school bus carrying mentally

and leaving 12 other people injured, officials said.
   The passengers _ nine children and three adults _ were on their

County Board of Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities,
when the accident happened Monday.
   Monica Roth of Northwood, who was sitting directly behind the

   The 11 other passengers and the driver were taken to Wood County
Hospital, where they were treated for cuts and bruises.
   Sgt. Al Vargo of the highway patrol said the driver couldn't
regain control of the bus after slipping off the side of the road.
   ``When she tried to bring her bus back on the roadway, she, for
some reason, lost control of the bus and it went back off the right
side of the road and overturned,'' he said.
   Vargo said the accident is under investigation.

<TEXT>
   More than 50 independent
production companies, including Johnny Carson's talk show, are
seeking exemptions from striking scriptwriters, union officials say.
   That would allow some companies to work during the Writers Guild
of America strike against the 200-member Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers. No talks were scheduled in the 10-day-old
strike by 9,000 Guild members.
   Brian Walton, West Coast executive director of the guild, said
its board would consider appeals for an interim agreement with
several companies. Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the writers,
said decisions on exemptions would probably be announced Wednesday
or Thursday.
   Walton declined to identify those seeking interim agreements,
but ``The Tonight Show'' announced through its publicists that it
was among them.
   A spokesman for the producers belittled the union's assertion
about the number of independents seeking waivers.
   ``The overwhelming number of independents are actually a writer
that employs himself for tax purposes. He produces nothing,'' said
Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg. ``With the exception of Carson,
I don't know of any other independent producer looking to make a
deal who is also member of the alliance.''
   Among shows already rejected for a waiver or interim contract
was the Academy Awards, scheduled for broadcast on April 11.
   Lobell-Bergman Productions disclosed Monday that the strike has
affected development of five of eight movies on its slate and
stopped work on a network comedy series. Previously postponed was a
revival of ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and ``The
Dictator,'' a new series starring Christopher Lloyd.
   The guild is seeking an increase in creative control, an
increase in residuals from foreign market distribution, and
rejection of a producers' contention that residuals for hour-long
syndicated television shows should be adjusted.

<HEAD>Troubled Maker Of AIDS Drugs Promises Better Quality But Faces New
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has
released a new report sharply criticizing quality control
procedures at LyphoMed Inc., which makes drugs to fight symptoms of
AIDS and other diseases.
   An FDA official said Monday a re-inspection of LyphoMed's main
manufacturing plant found the same sort of problems that led the
agency to take disciplinary action against the suburban Chicago
company last fall.
   LyphoMed said Monday it intends to respond to the latest
inspection report later this week.
   ``We are committed to ensuring that our quality meets and
exceeds the FDA standards,'' said John N. Kapoor, LyphoMed's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   LyphoMed gained national prominence for its sales of
pentamidine, a drug used to fight a form of pneumonia that
frequently kills people with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   In November, the federal agency warned LyphoMed it could be
taken to court if ``serious violations'' of FDA regulations were
not corrected, and it suspended approval of the company's
applications to market new drugs.
   The latest FDA report listed 44 violations of ``good
manufacturing practices'' found during a three-month inspection.
   Violations cited included shipping products that had failed some
sterility tests, changing the manufacturing process for several
drugs without knowing the effect of the changes, distributing drugs
without proper FDA approval, and other quality control problems.
   George Bailey, a compliance officer at the FDA's Chicago
district, said the problems were the same type of violations as
cited last fall, Bailey said.
   ``The severity and degree of the violations is yet to be
determined,'' he said.
   LyphoMed said in a statement that it had appointed a new
director of quality control and a new director of regulatory
affairs since November.
   The discovery of new or continuing violations doesn't
necessarily mean the FDA will continue its suspension of work
processing LyphoMed's applications to market new drugs, Bailey said.
   ``It depends on how significant the deviations would be and what
they have done to correct them,'' he said.
   A former LyphoMed employee, Richard Johnson, filed a lawsuit
earlier this month claiming the company had fired him because he
refused to release drugs that had failed quality tests. LyphoMed
has said he was fired for ``performance reasons.''

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 protesters marched through
the streets of this Communist capital today calling for democracy
and freedom of the press.
   Dozens of police patrols passed by, but authorities made no
attempt to hinder the unofficial protest, which came on the
anniversary of Hungary's aborted 1848 revolution against Austria.
   Protesters carried signs that read ``We Want Democracy'' and
``We Want Freedom of the Press'' and chanted anti-government
slogans.
   Groups of demonstrators whistled and applauded when police
vehicles passed by, but authorities refused to act on what appeared
to be attempts to provoke them.
   The protesters blocked traffic and attracted large groups of
passers-by, some of whom joined the throng as it meandered through
central Budapest.
   Dissident sources said four prominent activists were detained in
advance of the unofficial protest. The sources earlier report three
activists had been taken into custody.
   Communist party authorities, meanwhile, held an official rally
to mark the anniversary on the steps of Budapest's national museum,
where the 1848 revolution broke out.
   Communist party officials laid wreaths and made speeches calling
for greater national unity and economic progress.
   Hungarian dissidents have marked the anniversay by staging
unofficial rallies on March 15 since 1973, and have met with
varying reactions from authorities.
   Last year, police allowed thousands of people to march through
downtown Budapest, calling for democracy as part of one of the
biggest unofficial protests here in years.
   But in 1986, police clashed with protesters on March 15, and
broke up that year's unofficial demonstration.
   Hungary has won a reputation as a relatively liberal Soviet bloc
country, although far less dissent is tolerated than in Western
countries.
   One dissident source identified three of the activists detained
this morning as writer Miklos Haraszti, Tamas Mlynar and Gabor
Demszky, Hungary's biggest underground publisher.
   The source, who asked not to be named, said two other activists
_ Ottilia Solt and writer Gyoergy Gado _ may also have been taken
into custody. He said friends were unable to reach them early today.
   Sources speculated the activists were detained to warn
dissidents away from the unofficial protest, and predicted they
would be relased later today.
   Police have raided the homes of at least eight dissidents during
the past two weeks, including Gado, Solt and Demszky, sources told
The Associated Press.
   During the police search, hundreds of copies of unofficial
journals, political documents and books were confiscated, Haraszti
said.

   A former carnival worker has pleaded innocent
to charges of murdering an eight-year-old girl in 1951.
   Assistant Public Defender Michael Malloy entered the plea Monday
in Delaware County Common Pleas Court on behalf of his client,
William Henry Redmond.
   Redmond, 66, suffering from a heart condition and emphysema, sat
in a wheelchair and said nothing during the arraignment.
   A pretrial hearing is scheduled for April 11.
   At a preliminary hearing in February, State Police Trooper
Malcolm Murphy said Redmond had confessed to smothering Jane Marie
Althoff. Her body was found in a carnival truck in Trainer, a small
town about 15 miles southeast of Philadelphia, on April 25, 1951.
   Redmond, who was living in Grand Island, Neb., at the time of
his arrest, is charged with first- and second-degree murder,
voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, kidnapping and assault with
intent to ravish.
   Redmond is being held without bail in Delaware County Prison.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson said today ``we're going
to have a good day,'' casting his ballot as the Illinois
presidential primary began with a light turnout in cold weather. On
the Republican side, George Bush wondered aloud what was keeping
rival Bob Dole in the race.
   ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing,'' said Bush during
a final campaign swing in the state where polls were forecasting a
landslide victory for the vice president over his GOP rivals.
   But both Dole and Pat Robertson were insisting they were staying
in the race, though the former television evangelist said he would
re-evaluate his status if he gets less than 5 percent of the vote.
   Jackson voted at Bryn Mawr Community Church on the city's South
Side.
   ``We've been winning all the way and we'll keep winning,'' said
Jackson, the victor last Saturday in South Carolina and winner of
five states on Super Tuesday.
   The state's other Democratic favorite son, Sen. Paul Simon,
voted at the Makanda Fire Station in rural southern Illinois.
   After casting their ballots, Simon and his wife went to their
home and planted a tree in their yard, an election-day tradition.
   Between 2.5 million and 3 million voters were expected to turn
out for the primary on a wintry day. Kel Hudson, associate director
of the state Board of Elections, said that would represent 46
percent to 48 percent of the registered voters.
   Illinois does not have party registration so voters could choose
a Democratic or Republican ballot at their polling place.
   Initial reports from Chicago precincts were of a light turnout.
   Precinct captain William Smar said that during the first hour
and a half his polling place was open, only 15 of the 498
registered voters had cast ballots, nearly all of them Democrats.
   ``It's more quiet than normal for this type of election,'' said
Thomas Leach, spokesman for the city election commission.
   Illinois voters express their presidential preference in a
non-binding beauty contest and also elect convention delegates. It
was possible a candidate would do well in the popular vote, but
lose out in the contest for delegates to a contender who had
stronger slates filed in the state's 22 congressional districts.
   As if to emphasize his determination to fight on, Dole flew to
Wisconsin and Connecticut to campaign in two of the states that
follow Illinois.
   Simon said, ``I will win'' his home state's Democratic primary,
and conceded second place in either the popular vote or the
delegate contest would not be good enough.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he has made
``significant gains'' in his effort to finish ahead of at least one
of the state's two favorite-son candidates.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll done Saturday and Sunday
suggested Simon had the support of 39 percent of 328 likely
Democratic voters, with Jackson at 34 percent. Simon's lead was
within the poll's 6-point margin of error. Dukakis trailed with 17
percent.
   At stake in today's voting were 82 Republican and 113 Democratic
delegates. Another 10 GOP delegates will be chosen at the party
state convention in June. Sixty additional Democratic delegates
will be allocated to candidates in the same proportion as they won
delegates in the primary and 15 more elected and party officials
will become super delegates to the Democratic convention.
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 705, Dole
165 and Robertson 17 GOP convention delegates, out of the 1,139
needed for the nomination. On the Democratic side, Dukakis had
462.5, Jackson 423.55, Gore 352.8, Gephardt 145 and Simon 35.5.
There are 275.65 uncommitted Democratic delegates.
   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk suggested Monday he would try to
rally uncommitted delegates behind whichever candidate leads the
field when the primaries have ended, if none has yet secured a
numerical lock on the nomination.
   Kirk said Monday that the party leaders and other officials who
automatically hold seats as national convention delegates have a
``special responsibility'' to help ensure that the nominating
process does not turn into a political fight that damages the
nominee.
   Bush, in the aftermath of his Super Tuesday sweep of 16
primaries, saw Illinois as a chance to take another giant step
toward clinching the GOP nomination. Dole hoped the return to the
Midwest would blunt the vice president's momentum.
   Jackson saw his home state primary as an opportunity to
challenge Dukakis for the leadership of the Democratic field. For
Simon, Illinois was a fight for survival, while Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee was looking for ``an opportunity to punch
through'' with a victory in a Northern industrial state.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri did little campaigning in
Illinois, concentrating instead on Michigan, which holds Democratic
caucuses on March 26.
   A poll published Sunday in the Chicago Tribune gave Bush a
34-point lead over Dole among Illinois Republicans, with Robertson
a distant third.
   Yet, the Kansas senator insisted he had no plans to even
consider dropping out if he does poorly in Illinois.
   ``I've made a judgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we're
going to keep going,'' Dole said at a news conference on Monday.
   But he conceded candidates sometimes fail to understand when it
is time to get out.
   ``Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind
for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little,
somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said.

   Jury selection began today for the
trial of the first of 23 people charged with physically or sexually
abusing their children or young relatives, but there were fears
that impartial jurors might be in short supply.
   Margie Back, 33, sat hunched over in her chair, clutching her
purse, when Magoffin County Circuit Court Judge John R. Morgan
called the court to order. She is accused of using lighted
cigarettes to torture her three boys, ages 5, 8 and 10.
   Ms. Back, of the mountain hollow community of Seitz, is charged
with three counts of first-degree criminal abuse. She was not
charged with sexual abuse.
   Five trials have been scheduled through mid-June in this eastern
Kentucky coal mining county for 12 of the defendants, and the
remaining cases could come to trial later this year.
   ``It is difficult to get an impartial jury for any trial in
Magoffin County,'' said Deputy Judge-Executive Marcella Salyer, the
county's top appointed administrator. ``People have a lot of
connections, both politically and otherwise.''
   The investigation began when state social workers asked Kentucky
state police for help on a complaint of suspected child abuse in
1986. The social workers say they cannot reveal details on the
cases.
   Indictments were returned by a county grand jury that was shown
videotaped interviews with six children. The indictments were
accompanied by hand-written notes from some of the children
describing acts of sodomy and abuse among family members.
   Two members of the state attorney general's staff began handling
the case last August after a local prosecutor withdrew.
   The state prosecutors unsuccessfully sought in October to have
the trials moved, claiming the defendants were members of ``five
large, extended families'' that had too many friends and political
allies in the Appalachian Mountain county of about 14,000 people.
Many of the defendants share the family name Gipson.
   The prosecutors cited a courthouse demonstration in support of
the defendants in November 1986 and a series of sympathetic letters
to the editor of a local newspaper.
   Judge John R. Morgan said he would try to find an impartial jury
without moving the trial. He said he expected the case to last
three or four days, and was not sure if he would let the children
testify on videotape or in person in a state where cameras are
allowed in courtrooms.
   Dr. Lester Fahrner, a Lexington dermatologist, wrote in a
pretrial report that Ms. Back's three sons had numerous scars on
their faces, arms, backs and legs that ``suggest having been burned
with a cigarette or similar sized burning object.''
   The doctor reported that two of the boys told him their mother
was responsible for the scars.
   The children, and others in the county ranging from age 1 to 11
who were alleged victims of incest, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse,
physical abuse and assault, all have been placed in foster homes.
   Customers at the Coffee Cup restaurant, across the street from
the courthouse, said Monday the trials are bound to bring bad
publicity to a county that already has received more than its share.
   But Magoffin County shouldn't be viewed as a hotbed of physical
and sexual abuse against children, maintained Flynn Arnett, one of
the customers.
   ``You see it in the papers every day all over the country,''
Arnett said.
   John Arnett, business manager of The Salyersville Independent
and a distant relative of Flynn Arnett, agreed.
   ``This goes on everywhere but it just seems to fit into the
stereotypical view of people here,'' in the mountains, John Arnett
said. ``But that stereotype just isn't true.''
   Widespread vote-buying in the county was the focus of an article
in the Lexington Herald-Leader and a series of stories on election
fraud in The Louisville Courier-Journal last fall.
   Government services in the county also were shut down for five
weeks last summer when the Fiscal Court, the governing body, could
not reach agreement on an annual budget.

   Iraq said it fired six missiles into
Tehran today and its air force bombed other Iranian cities. Iran
said it pounded southern Iraqi towns with shells, short-range
rockets and warplane raids.
   Iran said civilians were killed in Iraqi missile attacks and
Iraq said Iranian shelling killed nine civilians in the city of
Basra.
   In New York, the Soviet Union acknowledged it failed to win
support for a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an end
to the deadly missile duel in the 7{-year-old war.
   The U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince was sailing up the
Persian Gulf in the 17th convoy conducted by the U.S. Navy this
year.
   The Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said six missiles
were fired into the Iranian capital today. It reported eight such
missiles strikes Monday.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
said ``a number'' of civilians were killed in missile attacks on
residential areas of Tehran overnight. It did not say how many
rockets hit the city.
   On Monday, Iran said missiles killed 26 civilians and wounded 50
in Tehran. Iraq also reported civilian casualties in Baghdad but
gave no figures.
   Iraq says it has fired 15 missiles into Tehran since the duel
resumed with a single rocket fired into the Iranian capital Sunday
night after a two-day truce. Iran has fired two into Baghdad.
   The Iraqi agency said warplanes pounded the western Iranian
cities of Dezful, Kermanshah and Hamadan today in ``destructive''
raids. IRNA said sores of civilians were killed.
   Iran said its artillery shelled Basra province, whose capital is
Iraq's second-largest city, and fired 11 short-range rockets into
the region. The Iraqi agency quoted its correspondent in Basra as
saying nine civilians were killed and 10 wounded.
   Tehran radio said Iranian warplanes bombed Al-Amarah, about
halfway between Basra and Baghdad, and the northeastern town of
Sulaymaniyah.
   IRNA said Monday that Revolutionary Guards commandos pushed to
within 12 miles of Sulaymaniyah. It said the Iranians seized a
dozen peaks and several villages, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqis.
   Iraq said the latest round of missile attacks was a reprisal for
Iran's shelling of Iraqi border towns Sunday night in which at
least 21 civilians were killed and 80 wounded.
   Baghdad earlier charged Iran broke a Friday cease-fire by
launching ground attacks and bombarding Iraqi towns.
   An uneasy two-day truce brought a brief respite after 12 days in
which both sides fired dozens of missiles and artillery fire and
launched air raids that killed or wounded hundreds of civilians.
   At the United Nations, Soviet Ambassador Alexander Belonogov
acknowledged Monday that the Soviet bid for a new resolution on the
``war of the cities'' had failed after the Security Council met
behind closed doors.
   ``Our personal preference would be a resolution of the Security
Council,'' he said, but the important thing is ``not the form but
the essence'' of the council's action.
   The United States saw the proposal as a maneuver designed to
deflect attention from the American push for a worldwide arms
embargo against Iran to punish it for refusing to honor the
council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan.
   Instead of a new resolution, the council is expected to issue a
statement later this week calling for an end to the missile attacks.
   The 46,723-ton Gas Prince, a liquefied-gas carrier was sighted
off Dubai at midday. It was escorted by the missile frigate
Simpson, witnesses reported.
   The convoy was the 39th since July, when the U.S. Navy began
escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers, re-registered under the American
flag, to protect them from Iranian attack. There have been no
direct attacks on any of the vessels since the escort operations
began.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police using tear gas, shotguns
and a water cannon today broke up a demonstration by unpaid public
employees as Panama's military government announced it would begin
partial salary payments to thousands of government workers.
   More than 500 employees of the Social Security Administration's
main hospital in Panama City blocked a divided highway this morning
before three units of riot police dispersed them.
   ``Fewer guns, more medicine,'' the workers chanted.
   A nurse, who declined to give her name for fear of reprisals,
said the hospital's 9,000 employees had been given no explanation
by supervisors of when or how they would be paid.
   Reporters saw five or six people brought to the hospital with
minor injuries from birdshot fired by police during the melee,
which tied up traffic for more than two hours. The facility was
offering only emergency services.
   The presidential press office said the partial payments would be
made on a sliding scale that would give full wages to more than
half of the public servants, with others receiving a percentage of
their salaries.
   The action came a day after sporadic violence broke out in the
capital and the Caribbean port city of Colon, the nation's second
largest, after word spread that public employees would not be paid
this week.
   Directors of the National Federation of Public Servants, which
represents nearly all government employees, said they would reject
the government plan and demand full wages.
   In another development, the Panamanian government asked Terrence
Kneebone, director of the U.S. Information Service here, to leave
the country within 48 hours, a U.S. Embassy source said.
   The government did not explain the expulsion, but Kneebone, a
leading embassy spokesman, has formally responded to several
government accusations in the past week, including a formal charge
that the United States was preparing to invade Panama.
   His response to that allegation was that it was ``ridiculous.''
   Some teachers, telephone and dock workers struck Monday to
demand their wages and police put down a demonstration in Panama
City with tear gas and rubber truncheons.
   Protesters lit fires in the streets of the capital and chanted
``Noriega must go'' _ a reference to Panama's military strongman,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The government provided no other details about its partial
payment plan, but sources said the plan would provide full wages to
employees making less than $30 every two weeks, while others would
get a percent of their salaries.
   On Monday, the government began selling sacks of food, called
``dignity bags,'' to unpaid workers.
   And the United States sent an additional 100 military personnel
to beef up security around the Panama Canal. The United States
already has 10,000 troops based along the waterway.
   More than 1,000 dockworkers walked off their jobs at ports in
Colon and in Panama City, the entrances to the the 50-mile-long
Panama Canal that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
   Alberto Soto, administrator of the Balboa Port in Panama City,
said the action would not slow down shipping through the vital
waterway, which normally handles about 30 ships a day.
   About 130,000 people, nearly one in every five working
Panamanians, are employed by the government. Until now, they have
supported Noriega whose ouster as head of the Panama Defense Forces
has been demanded by the opposition.
   The nation's deposed president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, told CBS
Television in a videotaped message that ``Noriega will not be able
to trick'' the government workers. ``He cannot pay them,'' said
Delvalle from the hiding place where he has been holed up since
Noriega engineered his ouster in a coup on Feb. 26, the day after
Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   The Reagan administration hopes the government's inability to
pay its workers will bring down Noriega, who is under indictment in
the United States on federal narcotics smuggling charges.
   The United States imposed several new economic sanctions on
Panama last Friday, including the withholding of $6.5 million in
Panama Canal fees due this week. It earlier cut off all economic
and military aid to the country.
   The 118 local and foreign banks that do business in Panama
remained closed Monday by government order for the 20th straight
day and there was no indication they would reopen today.

   The U.S. Labor Department has agreed to
allow South Carolina and North Carolina limited use of 17-year-old
school bus drivers through the end of the school year.
   The governors of the two states today announced the agreement
overriding a February order that had required a halt to the young
drivers by April 1.
   ``During our discussions with (Labor) Secretary (Ann)
McLaughlin, I think it became apparent that our school children
would be a lot safer riding with 17-year-olds with seven or eight
months of bus driving experience than it would be to have them
riding with drivers who have little or no experience driving a
school bus,'' North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin said.
   Without the extension there wouldn't be enough trained drivers
to transport students, the governors contended.
   Under the agreement, all districts in both states may use
drivers who will turn 18 before June 15. And certain districts that
have had difficulty hiring older drivers may through the end of the
school year use 17-year-old drivers who will not turn 18 by June 15.
   All 17-year-old drivers must have been hired and trained before
the school year began and must have clean driving records, the
agreement said.
   North Carolina has about 2,100 17-year-old drivers; South
Carolina has about 1,200.
   Tucker Eskew, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, estimated several hundred 17-year-old drivers in that
state would turn 18 by June 15.
   Seventeen-year-olds have been permitted to drive school buses in
the two states under an exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   That was repealed after Labor Department investigations found
North Carolina had violated the act 80 times in January and
February, and South Carolina had recorded 200 violations in that
time.
   The investigation was triggered when a 4-year-old boy in West
Columbia, S.C., was struck and killed by a 17-year-old driver with
a bad driving record.
   Martin said in a statement today that he would seek a $24
million from the legislature in June to increase the school bus
drivers pay so the state can attract more adult drivers.

<HEAD>Ex-NSC Staff Member Testifies Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former National Security Council staff member
Roger Robinson appeared before a federal grand jury today in the
criminal investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III and a
proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   Robinson worked closely with longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach in the summer of 1985, when supporters of the pipeline were
seeking U.S. support for the project.
   Robinson is the second NSC aide in two weeks to testify in the
probe of Meese being conducted by independent counsel James McKay.
Former NSC aide David Wigg testified earlier.
   In addition, two former aides in Meese's office, John Richardson
and John Harrison, testified last week before the grand jury to
which McKay's office is presenting evidence. Richardson was Meese's
chief of staff before leaving the Justice Department several months
ago. Harrison worked on Meese's staff in mid-1985.
   The probe of Meese revolves around whether he may have violated
the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes by
U.S. companies or their agents to foreign officials.
   Wallach wrote a memo to Meese in September 1985 saying that a
portion of up to $700 million from the pipeline would be paid to
the Israeli Labor Party. Meese says he doesn't recall reading the
portion of the memo relating to planned Labor Party payments.
   Wallach had been hired by Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport to assist
in the project and Wallach went to Meese on the matter in May 1985.
Meese referred him to then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, who directed that Robinson assist the project.
   Iraq was seeking an insurance package for the pipeline in the
event it was bombed by Israel. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres gave assurances that Israel would not attack the line, but
Iraq wanted a financial package to back up that promise.
   The NSC aides assisted on a number of proposed packages,
initially trying to promote a $400 million bank-backed package
acceptable to the Overseas Private Investment Corp. The government
agency insures foreign investments by U.S. firms such as Bechtel
Group Inc., which was going to build the project.
   Robinson left the NSC and his place on the project was taken by
Wigg, who worked with Wallach on alternative proposals. Those
included pledging U.S. aid to Israel as a guarantee for the
pipeline and seeking to put Pentagon budget money for Israel in an
overseas escrow account as insurance. None of the insurance
proposals was adopted and the pipeline wasn't built.

<HEAD>Panel Finds Little Evidence That Cabinet Status Would Improve VA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent study group said today it could
find little evidence that elevating the Veterans Administration to
a Cabinet-level department would help the agency do its job better.
   The group and the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said changes in the way the VA is managed should
be made whether or not the agency is granted cabinet status.
   In a report to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, a
panel of the National Academy of Public Administration said it was
not making a recommendation for or against a Cabinet-level VA.
   William Fischer, chairman of the academy's seven-member study
group, said the panel did not take a vote on elevating the VA to
Cabinet status, but he said, ``We did agree on the report.''
   ``We are not here to discuss the priority of meeting the needs
... of veterans,'' Fischer told the committee. ``We are discussing
... structure.''
   The panel, which did the study in seven weeks, found ``little
evidence that the prospects of fulfilling the vital mission of
providing for the present and future needs of veterans would be
materially improved by elevating the VA to a Cabinet department.''
   The panel also said it does not believe the elevation to
Cabinet-status ``would significantly improve either access to the
president, the adequacy of necessary resources, or the
organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and
benefits.
   ``The panel does recognize the potential political value of
raising the public visibility of the needs of veterans and the
programs designed to meet these needs by making VA a department in
the president's Cabinet,'' the report said. ``However, given the
broad political support which already exists for the VA and its
programs, the gain would be at the margin.''
   Legislation to elevate the VA has been endorsed by President
Reagan and was approved by the House on Nov. 17. There has been
strong support in the Senate for passage.
   Governmental Affairs Committee chairman, Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, said at today's hearing: ``If the elevation of the VA to
Cabinet-level status is accompanied by significant measures to
improve the management and operation of the agency, as well as to
ensure the fair treatment of all veterans seeking access to agency
services and benefits, then the case for elevation becomes much
stronger.''
   Glenn said improvements within the VA legislation ``should be
the goal of this committee over the next few weeks.''
   The National Academy for Public Administration, chartered by
Congress, provides independent advice on the organization and
operation of government at all levels.

<HEAD>Army Sentences Three Soldiers To Jail For Beating Arabs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two soldiers were convicted and given less than
a month in jail for their role in the brutal Arab beatings taped by
an American television crew, the military said today.
   A military judge sentenced Ronnen Sasson to 21 days in jail and
Arieh Moalem to 10 days in jail, the army said. They were sentenced
Monday following their convictions on charges of brutality and
harassment.
   Sasson and Moalem, along with two other soldiers and an officer,
were taped by a CBS news crew on Feb. 25 as they beat and kicked
two bound Palestinian youths in Nablus, the largest city in the
occupied West Bank.
   The soldiers kicked the two Arabs in the head and chest, then
picked up fist-sized rocks and smashed them on arms and legs. CBS
said the beating lasted 40 minutes.
   The film produced widespread criticism and the West Bank
commander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, ordered the detention of four
soldiers and their commanding officer, all from the elite Golani
Brigade.
   The army said an investigation showed that Moalem and Sasson
played a relatively minor part in the beating. The film did not
show Moalem taking part.
   The army said that the two other soldiers involved, Yehuda Angel
and Saguy Harpaz, and their commander, Capt. Yossi Haddad, will
face more serious charges.

<HEAD>Deputies Seek `Hard Worker' Who Allegedly Buried Stolen Cars And
Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HESPERIA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent months industriously
burying stolen cars, trucks and other equipment in the back yard of
his rural home was being sought today, officials said.
   The man, identified as Korey Cragg, jumped out a back window of
his home when he was questioned by a deputy, sheriff's Detective
Allan L. Foreman said. Cragg was being sought for an alleged role
in a car-stripping operation.
   By Monday afternoon officials had unearthed more than a dozen
cars and trucks plus various equipment and car parts, officials
said. They also discovered numerous buried 55-gallon drums
containing motor oil, gasoline and transmission fluid.
   For months, residents living in the desert 65 miles northeast of
Los Angeles had watched as Cragg buried the vehicles with a
backhoe, Foreman said.
   ``A neighbor told us he was hauling out a trailer load of
engines every other day,'' Foreman said. ``He was a busy, busy boy.
It appears he was working 24 hours a day. ... He could go through
two or three cars a day.''
   Sylvestre Carrillo, who lives in a home just east of the house,
said he thought his neighbor was ``just a hard worker.''
   ``He'd be at it day and night,'' Carrillo said. ``He was a
pretty good mechanic, or so we thought.''
   Someone finally called the sheriff after seeing Cragg bury an
almost-new car over the weekend, and a deputy confronted Cragg on
Sunday.
   After answering a couple of questions, Cragg excused himself to
go to the bathroom. Instead, he climbed out a back bedroom window
and fled, Foreman said.
   Police found a stolen red Corvette in the garage and secured a
search warrant, Foreman said.
   Three people inside the house at the time were booked for
investigation of grand theft auto, a jail deputy in Victorville, 10
miles north of here, said. They were identified as Cragg's wife,
Kathy, 27, of Hesperia, and Brian Powell, 26 and Sheryl VanSanford,
28, both of Los Angeles County.
   Bail was set at $200,000 each and the three were scheduled for
arraignment Wednesday in Victorville Municipal Court, the deputy
said.
   On Monday, county detectives-turned-archaeologists returned to
excavate the cache of stolen property.
   The car-stripping operation apparently started about five months
ago, and Foreman said officialos had not idea how many vehicles
they might eventually find. He said investigators expect to find
even more buried cars in the surrounding desert.
   ``That's just a guess at this time,'' said Foreman. ``Neighbors
say he would haul the backhoe out into the desert to bury stuff.''

<TEXT>
   Monsignor Eugene A. Marino was named Roman
Catholic archbishop of Atlanta today and became the first black
archbishop in the United States.
   Marino called his appointment ``a great sign of hope to all of
our people.''
   Blacks have a rich religious tradition, but ``not a rich
tradition that enriches the Catholic church,'' Marino said today at
a news conference in Atlanta.
   Marino said he was ``not one to dodge issues; at the same time I
am not one to go out and look for issues for issues' sake.''
   He said he would try to follow the example of Jesus Christ, who
``never quite went out of his way, either to address needs or to
avoid addressing needs.''
   The appointment was announced by the Vatican and in Washington
by Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio in the United
States.
   Marino, 53 and a member of the Josephite order, succeeds
Archbishop Thomas A. Donnellan, who died Oct. 15. Marino has been
an auxiliary bishop in Washington, D.C., since 1974.
   He now will be titular head of the Roman Catholic church in
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, although his
responsibilities beyond the archdiocese in north Georgia are
limited.
   Marino said he hopes to expand the number of black Catholics in
this country. There are about 1.3 million blacks among the 52
million U.S. Catholics.
   Marino is the first black Catholic archbishop in the United
States, said William Ryan, spokesman for the United States Catholic
Conference in Washington.
   In 1971, Marino became the first black priest to hold the major
office of vicar general of a religious community _ the Josephite
Fathers, who are headquartered in Washington.
   He is also the first auxiliary bishop to be elected to high
office in the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the
United States Catholic Conference. His three-year term as secretary
of the groups ends in November.
   Marino was born in Biloxi, Miss., on May 29, 1934. He studied at
Epiphany Apostolic College in Newburgh, N.Y., from 1952 to 1955, at
Mary Immaculate Novitiate, also in Newburgh, from 1955 to 1956, and
at St. Joseph's Seminary in Washington from 1956 to 1962.
   He also received a master's degree in religious education from
Fordham University.
   Marino was ordained the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in
Washington on June 9, 1962.
   He taught at Epiphany College from 1962 to 1968, served as
spiritual director of St. Joseph's Seminary from 1968 to 1971 and
spiritual director of the permanent diaconate training program for
the Washington Archdiocese from 1969 to 1971.
   Marino was elected to a four-year term as vicar general of the
Josephite Fathers on July 13, 1971, and was serving in that
capacity when he was named auxiliary bishop of Washington and
titular bishop of Walla Walla, Wash., on July 15, 1974.

   Illinois is a direct-election primary, meaning its 113
congressional district delegates to the Democratic National
Convention are elected directly from the primary ballot.
   Ilinois Democrats will be faced with a two-part ballot in the
March 15 primary. The top part of the ballot will be a non-binding
presidential ``beauty contest,'' and the second part will list the
candidates for national convention delegate.
   The remainder of the state's pledged national convention
delegates will be picked by the State Central committee on May 7.
They will be allocated among presidential candidates in proportion
to the number of delegates from congressional districts pledged to
the candidates.

   Illinois Republicans have the same kind of two-part presidential
ballot as the Democrats. The top part of the ballot is a
non-binding presidential ``beauty contest,'' while the second part
lists the candidates for national convention delegate.
   The candidates for delegate can have the name of a presidential

   Eighty-two delegates will be elected directly from the ballot
and will be apportioned among congressional districts, ranging from
two to five delegates per district. The state's remaining 10
delegates will be elected at-large at the state convention June
16-18.

   Greece will open its first embassy at the
Vatican in a move that comes in the wake of improving relations
between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, a senior
foreign ministry official said Tuesday.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move
had no direct connection to easing of 900-year-old religious
tensions and Pope John Paul II's meeting with Orthodox Patriarch
Dimitrios I in December.
   He said the decision to open the embassy was made before the two
met.
   Greece established diplomatic relations with the Vatican 10
years ago. Its ambassador in Paris has been accredited there.
   The Greek Orthodox Church is one of the autonomous Eastern
Orthodox churches organized mainly along national lines. It
recognizes the leadership of the patriarch of Constantinople,
modern-day Istanbul, Turkey, rather than that of the pope.
   The Greek diplomat said the decision to send an ambassador was
approved by the Greek parliament last month. He did not say when an
ambassador will be picked.

<TEXT>
   Some people in the southern
Philippines still believe a serpent swallows the sun every night,
but those who don't are buying ``eclipse viewers'' at about $2 each
to watch a total solar eclipse.
   Davao City is one of the best places to see the eclipse Friday
morning. It will be visible longer in Mati, but you can hardly get
there from here or anywhere else.
   The viewing devices are made of cardboard, in the shape of
eyeglasses or scopes, with exposed photographic film as lenses.
   An estimated 1,500 scientists, journalists and observers from
all over the world will bring more elaborate equipment to watch the
moon blot out the sun.
   A Department of Tourism brochure says the rare phenomenon will
be visible Friday in three areas: Sumatra, Indonesia; Kkalimantan,
Borneo, and the southern Philippines, where it can be seen longest.
   Nowhere will the view surpass that in the Davao area, 600 miles
southeast of Manila on Mindanao Island.
   For three minutes, day will become night as the moon moves
between the Earth and the sun. Darkness is expected to envelop
neighboring General Santos City at 9:05 a.m.; Davao at 9:07 a.m.,
and Mati in adjacent Davao Oriental province 38 seconds later.
   Along with the makeshift glasses and scopes, the most popular
items at sidewalk stalls in advance of the eclipse were baseball
caps at $1.50 or less and T-shirts ranging in price from $1.75 to
$6.
   Some shirts proclaim ``I was there.''
   Others depict a man battling a huge serpent wrapped around the
sun, representing the ancient belief that the sun disappears each
day because the serpent Bakunawa swallows it.
   Friday morning could be noisy in Davao and General Santos City.
People who still believe in Bakunawa will bang pots and pans in
hopes the noise will distract the serpent's attention from the sun.
   Although the eclipse is expected to last longest in Mati, the
town has been all but ignored in advertisements because it has only
two small lodging facilities and is much harder to reach than the
Davao and General Santos, said Roger Layson, regional tourism
officer.
   Officials said most of the visiting scientists, journalists and
other foreign observers would stay in General Santos. They are
expected to spend about $750,000.
   Layson said most of the foreign astronomers are American and
British, and most of the other observers Japanese. All hotels and
other facilities have been booked since January, and tourism
authorities have arranged lodgings in private homes for $7.50 to

   A woman and her daughter have returned to Texas
after retired U.S. commandos hired for $200,000 grabbed the girl in
Jordan where she had been taken by her father in a custody dispute,
newspapers reported today.
   Meanwhile, the United States expressed regret to Jordan over the
incident, and an American Embassy officer in Amman was recalled to
Washington for questioning about his knowledge of the affair, State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday in Washington.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on Saturday that the woman
and the commandos entered Jordan and seized Lauren Bayan, 7, from a
school bus Jan. 28 in Jerash, north of Amman.
   The woman had been identified at Kathy Mahoon, but Holly
Planells, head of American Children Held Hostage, said her name is
Cathy Phelps Mahone, The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times
Herald reported today.
   The woman claims her ex-husband, Jordanian-born Mohammed Ali
Bayan, kidnapped the child and took her to Jordan although she was
granted custody of the child following a divorce.
   Dallas County court records confirm that a judge granted Ms.
Mahone custody of her daughter, but police say they have no record
of the reported kidnapping in September.
   ``She (Ms. Mahone) called me from Texas and said they're alive
and well and very happy,'' Ms. Planells, of White Plains, N.Y.,
told the Morning News on Monday.
   ``She's really getting assimilated back to American life,'' Ms.
Plannels said, referring to the girl. ``It was a traumatic
experience to be away from her mother like that. Jordan is a
strange place.''
   Ms. Plannels declined to say where Ms. Mahone is, saying the
woman fears her husband ``will try this again.''
   Ms. Mahone, unable to get her daughter back through legal
channnels, hired former Army commandos to take the girl away from
her father, who claimed legal custody of the child under Jordanian
law, the Inquirer reported Saturday.
   Corporate Training Unlimited, a company in Fayetteville, N.C.,
that specializes in ``hostage rescue training,'' plotted and
carried out the seizure, the newspaper said.
   The Times Herald quoted Ms. Planells as saying the operation
cost Ms. Mahone $200,000. Ms. Mahone has mentioned the possibility
of a movie deal about the raid, Ms. Planells said.
   Company president Donald Feeney denied the story, but other
well-placed sources described the company's role, the Inquirer said.
   Bayan reported his daughter had been abducted by three Americans
and he published newspaper advertisements seeking information.
   Sameer Salem, a Jordanian friend of Bayan's, told The Associated
Press that Bayan had returned to Jordan in fall 1987 after selling
a Dallas restaurant called The Country Skillet.
   The recalled American Embassy official, who was not named, had
some knowledge prior to the incident that the group had arrived in
Jordan, Redman said. But the officer had been misled as to its
intentions.
   ``We have expressed regret to the government of Jordan for any
role that an embassy officer might have played in this violation of
Jordanian law,'' Redman said.
   There was no official comment from Jordanian authorities.
However, one Jordanian official, who did not want his name used,
said a Jordanian citizen was involved in getting the girl out of
Jordan.
   He said the man was an employee of an agency which does security
work for the U.S. Embassy and that he had been detained for
questioning. He did not give the man's name.

   About 300 protesters defied police
orders and marched in a human chain to demand greater freedom from
the communist government, witnesses said Tuesday.
   Police did not intervene except to order by loudspeaker that the
demonstrators disperse, the witnesses said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. The demonstration came Monday on the second day of
the Leipzig Trade Fair, which draws visitors from 100 nations.
   The protesters came out of a ``peace prayer'' in the Nicholas
Church in downtown Leipzig, marched about 500 yards to another
church where they sang songs, and then walked back to where they
began, said the witnesses. The protesters voluntarily left after
about 40 minutes.
   They were among more than 1,000 people who attended the prayer
service at the Lutheran church, according to the witnesses.
   Church officials speaking at the hour-long prayer service were
applauded when they demanded greater freedom for East Germans and
an end to legal actions against those who want to leave the
country, the witnesses said.
   An unidentified church official was quoted as telling the
congregation that the country needs laws in line with international
conventions.
   Officials of East Germany's Lutheran Church have become
increasingly outspoken in favor of improved human rights conditions
in the country.
   The witnesses also said government officials banned a Monday
night rally where activists had planned to publicize the plight of
East Germans who are denied the right to leave the country.

   A Nigerian official said Tuesday the
government will press ahead with its population control project
over the objections of Christian leaders who argue it favors
Moslems.
   The plan to curtail the growth rate in black Africa's most
populous nation, with about 95 million people, created considerable
controversy when it was announced last month. Christian leaders
said it favored the country's Moslem majority because Christian men
may only have one wife while Moslem men can marry up to four women.
   Several prominent women have demanded that the government also
institute a plan to limit Nigerian men to one wife.
   The government's population control plan attempts to limit women
to four children through education campaigns.
   Air Marshal Ibrahim Alfa of the Armed Forces Ruling Council said
the government intended to advance the plan anyway. ``This is a
policy that will take some time to take hold, and we are quite
aware of the problems it would face,'' he said.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed at VA, With or Without Cabinet-Level
Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Significant changes in the way the Veterans
Administration is being managed should be made whether or not it is
elevated to Cabinet status, a Senate committee was told Tuesday.
   A panel of the National Academy of Public Administration, an
independent study group, and the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, did not make recommendations on
whether the VA should become part of the president's cabinet.
   But in its reports to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
the seven-member academy panel said it found ``little evidence'' in
its study that Cabinet-level status would materially improve the
VA's mission of providing for the present and future needs of
veterans.
   ``The panel does not believe that such an elevation would
significantly improve either access to the president, the adequacy
of necessary resources, or the organization, management and
delivery of high-quality services and benefits,'' the report said.
   The panel said it ``does recognize the potential political value
of raising the public visibility of the needs of veterans and the
programs designed to meet these needs by making VA a department in
the president's Cabinet. However, given the broad political support
which already exists for the VA and its programs, the gain would be
at the margin.''
   The GAO said signficant changes are needed in the way the VA is
being managed, and that they should be made whether or not the
agency is granted Cabinet status.
   ``To appropriately manage any large, decentralized organization,
top management must have reliable information on each unit's output
and the resources used to achieve the output,'' the office said.
``GAO reports have documented situations in which top managers were
unaware of inefficient or poor quality services because they lacked
complete, reliable and accurate data and the incentives to use
those data to improve service delivery.''
   The GAO recommended that the VA's deputy administrator, or the
undersecretary if the VA is made a cabinet department, be given the
responsibility for the agency's day-to-day management.
   The academy panel said it had seen reports of internal
weaknesses in the VA. However, it concluded that a Cabinet
department is not required to make necessary improvements,
``although the creation of more presidential appointments could
improve the quality of veterans programs by attracting better
managers.''
   A Cabinet-level VA could possibly achieve more uniformity of
broad, cross-cutting national policy goals, the panel conceded.
However, it said, ``there are other mechanisms now in place or
available which have been, and could be, used to accomplish these
purposes whether or not the VA is elevated to be a Cabinet
department although Cabinet status might make the current
mechanisms work more effectively.''
   President Reagan has endorsed legislation to raise the VA to
Cabinet status. The House passed a similar bill last Nov. 17. There
also has been strong support in the Senate for passage of the
legislation.
   The VA is an independent agency created in 1930. It provides
health, disability, pension and death benefits to veterans, as well
as loans and educational programs.

<TEXT>
   Judges in John Demjanjuk's war crimes trial
granted a defense request Tuesday to admit new evidence from 15
Holocaust survivors who failed to identify the retired Ohio
autoworker as a Nazi guard.
   Defense attorney Yoram Sheftel said the new evidence casts doubt
on testimony from five Treblinka death camp survivors who
identified Demjanjuk from a 1942 photograph as ``Ivan the
Terrible.'' Prisoners used that nickname for the guard who operated
gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   ``There are 15 statements of Treblinka survivors who did not
identify Demjanjuk as Ivan versus five who did,'' Sheftel told
Israel radio. ``This evidence is extremely substantial and
extremely important.''
   The three-judge panel interrupted its deliberations Tuesday to
consider the new evidence during a special session in Jerusalem
District Court. Demjanjuk's year-long trial ended Feb. 18.
   The judges set a court session for Monday to allow prosecutors
and defense attorneys to address the new evidence in summary
arguments, assistant prosecutor Eliyahu Avram said.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 67, retired as a Cleveland-area
autoworker and says he is the victim of mistaken identity.
   Sheftel said the latest evidence also includes statements
revealing there were at least six Nazi guards who resembled
Demjanjuk at Treblinka.
   Sheftel said he received the new evidence last week. A federal
judge in Washington ordered the Justice Department to release the
documents after Demjanjuk's family sued for them under the Freedom
of Information act.

<HEAD>Capitol Police Seized 1,162 Weapons Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitol Police, who have arrested visitors
carrying an Uzi machine gun, a pistol disguised as a beeper and
soda bottles containing explosives, are worried about a 147 percent
surge in weapons seizures at the Capitol last year.
   The police confiscated 1,162 weapons from visitors entering the
Capitol or six adjacent House and Senate office buildings in 1987,
up from 470 weapons seizures the previous year, according to House
Sergeant at Arms Jack Russ.
   Russ is citing these figures to lobby for an $18.5 million plan
to tighten security on the House side of the Capitol, including
bombproof glass around the visitors' gallery overlooking the House
chamber.
   Russ said in an interview that most of the weapons last year
were seized from visitors who were unaware of gun control
restrictions at the Capitol and had no criminal intent. These
included constituents carrying out-of-state gun permits that are
invalid on the Capitol grounds.
   Of the 1,162 arrests on illegal weapons charges last year, he
said, only 63 were prosecuted, compared with 50 arrests prosecuted
in 1986.
   The House security plan being pushed by Russ calls for spending
$4.2 million to install shatterproof glass shields around the House
visitors' gallery and modify seats on the chamber floor to protect
against bomb blasts.
   He also is requesting a $4.7 million emergency telephone system
to alert every House office immediately to a terrorist attack,
$413,352 worth of additional bomb detectors in House office
buildings, a $3.5 million electronic card system for access to
House garages, and a $5.7 million alarm system connecting
home-district offices with local police.
   Strict anti-terrorist proposals, such as placing a wrought iron
security fence around the Capitol grounds and glass enclosures
around the House and Senate galleries, have been widely criticized
in the past.
   Many legislators argue that the Capitol, as a symbol of open
democracy, should be easily accessible to the public. But Russ says
this is unrealistic because of growing security threats.
   ``I think everybody _ me included _ would like the easy-going
atmosphere of a Mayberry RFD police force, with a friendly cop
directing traffic,'' Russ said. ``But in this day and time, you
also need a high-tech, well-trained police department. You've got
to have both.''
   Russ outlined his plan last week at a House Appropriations
subcommittee hearing on the proposed $1.96 billion budget for
congressional operations next year, and plans to seek spending
authority from a separate House committee.
   Still awaiting action by the House and Senate leadership is a
more sweeping security plan that calls for fencing in the Capitol
Plaza, a parking ban on the East Front plaza and gatehouses to
screen visitors before they enter the Capitol grounds.
   Although only authorized vehicles are permitted to enter the
Capitol grounds, pedestrians may enter unhindered and are not
screened for illegal weapons until enter the Capitol building
itself, or adjacent office buildings.
   The comprehensive security plan for the entire Capitol area has
been approved by the Capitol Police Board, consisting of the House
and Senate sergeants at arms, the Capitol Police chief and the
architect of the Capitol.
   A $13 million appropriation to implement the plan remains
largely unspent, awaiting a final go-ahead from congressional
leaders. Russ said he hopes the leaders will meet before the end of
April to review the broader plan.
   Meanwhile, police are using hydraulically operated, steel street
barricades to halt unauthorized vehicles at the two main traffic
entrances to the Capitol grounds. In addition, large concrete
flower and shrubbery pots stand along driveways and sidewalks to
thwart any attempted truck bombings of the Capitol.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
registered his objections today to a Mideast peace conference and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the two had been unable to
bridge their differences on a U.S. proposal for negotiations on
settling the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   But both pledged to continue their efforts. President Reagan, in
a speech to an American Jewish audience, described the situation in
the Middle East as ``urgent.''
   Reagan also gave assurances in talking to the United Jewish
Appeal that ``we will not leave Israel to stand alone, nor will we
acquiesce in any effort to gang up on Israel.'' The president
added: ``Peace will not be imposed by us or by anyone else. It will
and must come from the genuine give-and-take of negotiations.
That's what we're working to set in motion now.''
   Emerging with Shamir from a 90-minute session at the State
Department, Shultz said ``we haven't found our way to bridge all of
the differences.'' But, he said, ``I see quite clearly what the
nature of the difference are and what they aren't.''
   Shultz did not offer any details, but Shamir underscored a major
disagreement with the plan for negotiations Shultz devised two
weeks ago and proposed to Arab and Israeli leaders.
   ``We are interested, first of all, to negotiate directly with
all the parties concerned,'' Shamir said. ``We don't see any
positive role for an international conference.''
   Shultz's plan would have an international conference attended by
the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France
convene last month and set the stage for negotiations between
Israel and a mixed Jordanian-Palestinian delegation by May 1.
   Shamir is concerned the Soviet Union and China, which do not
have relations with Israel, would try to tilt the outcome in the
Arabs' favor.
   Shultz called his session with Shamir ``very constructive and
worthwhile'' and said ``we feel encouraged to continue our efforts
to work with Israel and others in the Middle East to seek greater
stability, constructive and peaceful relations in the region.''
   Shamir said their talk was `'very serious and thorough.'' He
pledged to cooperate with Shultz and others in the U.S. government
``to get peace and to enhance the prospects for peace in our area.''
   Shamir, meanwhile, added Pat Robertson, a television evangelist
seeking the Repulbicn presidential nomination, to his afternoon
schedule.
   In a tough speech Monday night to an American Jewish group,
Shamir said yielding territory on the West Bank and Gaza would
invite another attempt by the Arabs to destroy Israel.
   ``These matters are questions of life and death, of our very
existence,'' Shamir told a United Jewish Appeal group.
   Shultz's plan for peace talks anticipates Israel relinquishing
at least some of the territory in exchange for Arab recognition of
the Jewish state.
   But Shamir said ``the two most dangerous attempts to destroy
us'' _ in the 1948 and 1967 wars _ were made when Israel did not
control the territories.
   During a stop in New York Monday to meet with American Jewish
leaders, and then in an arrival statement at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington, the Israeli prime minister made it clear he
would not give Shultz a yes-or-no answer on the peace plan.
   Instead, Shamir seemed intent on persuading the Reagan
administration to revise its blueprint. It calls for a peace
conference by May 1 to set up Palestinian self-rule for three
years, and then negotiations by December on an overall settlement.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters at the White House
under rules of anonymity, appeared to rule out any major revisions
in the proposal Shultz gave 10 days ago to Israel, Jordan, Syria
and Egypt.
   The official acknowledged ``it gives pain to all of the
parties,'' but he said ``we won't let any aspect be eroded or
compromised.''
   So far, the official said, Israel and the Arabs had not rejected
the plan, which he called an improvement over the 1978 Camp David
agreements that produced a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel
but failed to resolve the Palestinian problem.
   Shamir, who met briefly Monday with Shultz and Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci, had a busy schedule today. It began with
breakfast with Shultz at his home, lengthy talks with him at the
State Department and meetings with Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III and congressional leaders.
   The Israeli leader sees President Reagan on Wednesday.
   While Shamir promised to keep an open mind in the talks, he took
a hard line on Israel's retention of the West Bank and Gaza in his
speech Monday night.
   ``I am astonished at some people's short memory,'' Shamir said.
``Did we have peace when we did not have these territories? Don't
they remember that the two most dangerous attempts to destroy us _
in 1948 and in 1967 _ were made when we did not control any of
these territories? Do they want us to go back to a situation which
would inevitably invite another such attempt?''
   Referring to the recent violence on the West Bank and in Gaza in
which 91 Palestinians have perished, Shamir said ``it is not a war
for a Palestinian state in those areas. It is a war against
Israelis, against the existence of the state of Israel.''
   He said Israel's enemies, ``taking a leaf from the Ayatollah
Khomeini's war manual,'' had incited women and teen-agers to fight
a war of violence in the streets. ``I promise you,'' Shamir said.
``They will fail again.''
   His hesitation to respond directly to the U.S. plan for
negotiations did not seem to distress the Reagan administration.
``We are not pressing Israel,'' the senior U.S. official said.
   However, he said, ``it is the situation in the area which is
pressing Israel and all the other parties in the area.''
   Shamir did not disclose the revisions he will propose to Shultz,
who devised the plan and set this week as a deadline for a reply
from the Israeli and Jordanian governments.

   The protective ozone layer over the United
States appears to have shrunk about 2.3 percent since 1969,
scientists said today in the most thorough study yet of ozone
depletion.
   Experts have estimated that a 1 percent depletion could mean a 5
percent to 6 percent increase in skin cancers.
   But today's report from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the work of more than 100 experts over 17 months,
put the annual ozone depletion over the mid-latitudes of the
northern hemisphere at a much higher rate.
   Those latitudes, 30 degrees to 64 degrees, take in all of the
United States except southern Texas, Louisiana and Florida and
extend halfway up Canada's Yukon Territory.
   The scientists laid the responsibility for the ozone depletion
squarely on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals used to power
some aerosol sprays.
   ``At this point there is no other culprit to blame,'' said
Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine. ``We
have taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed to
affect ozone.''
   The report also said that the annual springtime depletion of
ozone over Antarctica appears to be diluting ozone yearround over
the Southern Hemisphere to about 60 degrees southern latitude, a
point midway between the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and Cape
Horn at the southern tip of South America.
   Rowland, who headed one NASA study groups, said the scientists
had re-examined years of ground-based and satellite observations of
the atmosphere to remove the normal biennial fluctuations of many
atmospheric characteristics and also the effects of the 11-year
solar cycle.
   The ground-based observations were limited to mid-latitudes in
the Northern Hemisphere because there are few stations elsewhere in
the world. But never before have scientists re-analyzed the monthly
data at differing latitudes to try to remove the solar and biennial
fluctuations.
   Ozone in the atmosphere 15 miles to 25 miles up filters out the
sun's ultraviolet rays, making life on earth possible. The same
ultraviolet breaks up the CFC compounds, liberating chlorine, which
in turn destroys ozone.
   Ozone is a pollutant on the ground, but CFCs don't break up
there _ not enough ultraviolet gets through.
   CFCs were banned as aerosol propellants in the United States in
1978, and worldwide emissions declined. There was one report in
1983 from the National Academy of Sciences that said future ozone
decline would be only 2 percent to 4 percent.
   But CFC use started growing again, in part because one compound
turned out to be ideal for cleaning computer chips and other
electronic parts. Other major uses are for refrigeration fluids and
as blowing agents in making plastic foams.
   Then an annual ozone ``hole'' over the Antarctic was discovered,
and records going back to 1958 showed that it hadn't happened
before the late 1970s.
   Discovery of the ozone hole _ an annual Antarctic springtime
plunge in ozone concentrations, last year by a record 50 percent _
spurred treaty negotiators last fall in Montreal.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1
percent thinning of the Earth's ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6
percent increase in skin cancer. If CFC use continued increasing at
2.5 percent per year, EPA said, 20 percent of the ozone barrier
could be gone in the next century.
   Today's report came one day after the Senate, on a vote of 83-0,
became the first major chemical-producing nation to ratify a
31-country treaty cutting emissions that damage the Earth's
protective ozone layer.
   The treaty commits the signers to a 50 percent cut from 1986
levels in production of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,
by 1998.
   The treaty will be officially ratified when the president signs
it. Though the United States will be the first major producer of
CFC compounds to ratify, it is not the first ratifier _ that is
Mexico.
   Under the treaty, EPA says, the decline would slow to the point
where it would be swamped by the normal year-to-year fluctuations.
   The Soviet Union has several CFC plants under construction, and
won concessions permitting it to exceed the treaty limits for a
time _ which led to a Soviet treaty signature in December. Similar
provisions were made for developing countries. If those exceptions
are used, the Environmental Defense Fund has estimated, the actual
1998 rollback in emissions could be 35 percent instead of 50
percent.

   In an interview with his biographer, porno
actor John C. Holmes said he did not know who was responsible for a
multiple murder in which he was a suspect, a newspaper reported
today.
   Holmes said that during the hours before four people were
bludgeoned to death and a fifth was maimed at a house in Laurel
Canyon on July 1, 1981, he was held at gunpoint at another house.
   The Los Angeles Times, relying on two unidentified sources
familiar with the manuscript of Holmes' as-yet-unpublished
biography, reported that after his captors let him go, he went to
the house where the killings occurred and discovered the bodies.
   The biography is based on extensive interviews with the actor,
but it was not clear when those interviews were conducted. One of
the sources said: ``John ... did not know up to the time of his
death who did the murders. He was not there when it happened.''
   Holmes died early Sunday at the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Sepulveda at the age of 43. He died of pneumonia brought
on by AIDS, his second wife, Laurie, said Monday.
   Holmes, a leading sex film actor of the 1970s and early '80s,
was tried and acquitted in the murders in 1982. At the time of the
killings, Holmes was a cocaine addict.
   Within the last six weeks, homicide detectives again questioned
Holmes about his role in the killings, but he either refused or was
unable to answer, the Times reported.
   Attorneys James M. Eisenman and William D Kibanow confirmed
Monday that a biography of Holmes has been offered to several
publishers, but they declined to discuss its contents. The lawyers
represent Mrs. Holmes, 24, and her husband's estate. The
biographer's name was not revealed.
   Holmes had been hospitalized with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome since November.
   Authorities have theorized that the Laurel Canyon killings were
committed to avenge an armed robbery of nightclub owner Adel
Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash.
   Former Deputy District Attorney Ronald S. Coen, who prosecuted
the case, said Holmes was a middleman between Nash and a theft ring.
   Coen said Holmes set up the armed robbery of Nasrallah and later
was forced to lead the killers to the Laurel Canyon house where
members of the ring were staying.

   WASHINGTON (APents.
   ``You find me a professor anywhere in North America that can
handle 3,169 questions _ and they weren't stupid questions,''
Phillips said.
   Students who miss Phillips' lecture on the first day of class
can only guess at the appearance of the professor known by his
computer address ``gmp.''
   ``One says she's going to track me down to see what I look like
and talk to me face to face. I said `Catch me if you can,''' said
Phillips.
   One student who asked that her name not be used said the course
puts too much emphasis on computer communication.
   ``It's like E-Mail is God,'' she said. ``It really shouldn't bere has
to be some communication that is one-on-one.''
   Others disagree.
   ``I don't think we've suffered any because we e
like that. Thhaven't seen him
face to face,'' said Michael Guerin, a senior operations management
major from Rochester, N.Y. ``He's readily available on the
computer.''
   Phillips has a contract to write a book on the course, which he
said has generated widespread interest.
   ``We've been visited by educators from Norway, Australia and
Japan. A lot of people are looking over our shoulder in this
process,'' he said.
   Warner Burke, a professor at Teachers College of Columbia
University, said Phillips' emphasis on mimicking a corporate
hierarchy hinders the students' understanding of how they come to
their decisions.
   ``Here our goals are understanding the group process, not just
decision making,'' said Burke, director psychology. ``The most important
aspect of group processes is non-verbal behavior.''

   Two married Department of Corrections guards have
been charged with conspiring to kill two robbery witnesses for
$50,000, authorities said.
   The couple were to present their victims' index fingers as proof
the contract was completed, prosecutors said.
   Wayne Lyle Cox, 48, and Linda Rae Cox, 36, both of Navasota,
were being held Tuesday in Harris County jail in lieu of $250,000
bond each.
   The Coxes were correctional officers at the Pack 1 Unit in
Navasota. Cox had worked for the prison system for nearly six
years, while Mrs. Cox had been employed for nearly five years, said
TDC spokesman David Nunnelee.
   The case developed after a Harris County prisoner fighting
extradition to Arkansas on charges of robbing a jewelry store began
spreading word about seeking a contract killing for two store
employees, said Prosecutor Jon Munier.
   Before long, an undercover officer made contact with the Coxes,
who discussed the planned killing in recorded conversations, Munier
said.
   On March 11, Cox accepted $10,000 from the undercover officer as
a downpayment on the job, Munier said.
   The intended victims remain under guard in Arkansas, Munier said.
   ``Those people aren't the only hit teams this guy's got,''
Munier said. ``He's been robbing Zales jewelry stores in Texas and
all over, and he's got a lot of money to spend.''

<TEXT>
   David Bowie, Jennifer Rush, U-2 and other Western
rock groups will join Soviet musicians for a series of concerts to
raise money to fight drug addiction.
   The concerts, originally scheduled for this month, are to take
place in late April, the Novosti Press Agency said.
   Novosti did not give a date, but said the three six-hour
concerts will be held at the 30,000-seat Olympic Stadium in Moscow.
   The agency did not say why they were delayed, but sources close
to the organizers blamed the postponement on bureaucratic red tape.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said former
Beatles George Harrison and Paul McCartney, as well as Julian
Lennon, the son of the late Beatle John Lennon, had been invited.
It was unclear whether they would participate.
   The press agency said revenue from ticket sales will be donated
to the United Nations fund for the struggle against drug addiction
and to the Soviet toxicology research center.
   Sponsors include several Soviet organizations and trade
companies from the United States, West Germany and Hungary.
   Soviet officials denied reports of drug abuse in the country
until Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness. Now,
newspaper stories often point out the problems and have disclosed
there are 50,000 diagnosed addicts and many more who may be
undiagnosed.
   Novosti said musicians from 10 North American and European
countries will peform along with several Soviet groups. Among the
foreign groups that have agreed to perform, Novosti said, are Level
42, Supertramp, U-2, Foreigner, Tangerine Dream, Bon Jovi, Jennifer
Rush and David Bowie.
   Participating Soviet groups are Aquarium, Bravo, Brigade S,
Black Coffee and others whose music ranges from heavy metal to
traditional rock 'n' roll, according to Novosti.
   Tickets will be about $16, much more expensive than for the
average Soviet concert. When Billy Joel performed in Moscow last
summer, tickets sold for a little under $8.

   The crimefighting Guardian Angels
illegally solicited $17,863 in Florida last year and will be fined
$450 for failing to comply with charity laws, officials say.
   The Division of Licensing cited the group last month for
violations in the first half of 1987. The Guardian Angels were
cited for soliciting funds without a license, hiring a private
fund-raiser without reporting it, failing to maintain records of
contributions and failing to have identification as a charitable
group while soliciting, said division spokesman Alan C. Rollins.
   Angels founder Curtis A. Sliwa, whose red-bereted army patrols
subways and neighborhoods in several cities, blamed the violations
on ignorance.
   The New York City-based Alliance of Guardian Angels Inc. now
complies with Florida laws, state spokesman Rollins said. In
reports filed last year, the group said it received $17,863 and
spent about $10,000.
   New York state records show the Angels received $117,139
nationwide last year, not including the value of free rent and
services. The group has debts of $122,086.

Patrick Sherrill.
   ``It is as if our friends will be there,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Ms. Smith and Brehm had been dating before the shooting. Brehm
has since transferred to the Lincoln, Neb., post office, and Ms.
Smith is on assignment in Oklahoma City, although she has applied
for a transfer to Lincoln.
   ``We still have nightmares,'' Ms. Smith said. ``But it's time we

   The couple escaped Sherrill's gunfire by running separately out
doors before the gunman returned and locked them. Sherrill fatally
shot himself to end the siege.

<HEAD>Vietnam Probing 29 Possible MIA Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is investigating another 29
possible cases of Americans who never returned home from the
Vietnam War, a U.S. military official said Tuesday.
   The latest inquiry could represent a significant step in
resolving the fates of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in
action since the United States withdrew its troops in 1973.
   ``The Vietnamese told us they are investigating 29 instances
where they have received information, material or remains,'' said
Lt. Col. Joe Harvey. ``But they said it will take at least three
weeks for them to draw any conclusions from these investigations or
to have remains to repatriate.''
   Harvey, commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center
based in Hawaii, returned Tuesday from four days of what he
described as ``positive and productive'' talks on accounting for
the MIAs. It was the fourth round of negotiations since retired
Gen. John W. Vessey, a presidential envoy, visited Vietnam in
August and the Vietnamese agreed to end a deadlock on the MIA issue.
   Harvey said his team provided new information to the Vietnamese.
He said it also visited the crash site of an American aircraft near
the major northern port of Haiphong, about 60 miles southeast of
Hanoi, but he gave no details.
   At least 27 U.S. aircraft were shot down when the United States
in December 1972 launched air strikes in the Hanoi-Haiphong area to
pressure the communists into signing a peace agreement.
   Harvey's team is composed of six experts from the casualty
center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. Nguyen Can,
deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North American affairs
department, headed the Vietnamese side at the talks.
   Vessey had asked the Vietnamese to give top priority to
resolving 70 ``discrepancy cases,'' in which the United States says
there is strong evidence that Vietnamese officials know the fates
of the missing Americans. These include cases where Americans
failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps.
   Since Vessey's talks, Vietnam has returned remains it believes
are those of Americans three times. The most recent, on March 2,
involved 17 sets of remains _ the largest turnover in two years and
the fourth largest since the war ended. The Vietnamese also turned
over reports on three other MIA cases.
   In exchange for Vietnamese cooperation on the MIA issue,
Washington has sent medical teams to Vietnam four times and
encouraged private U.S. agencies to provide assistance to
war-disabled Vietnamese. It has rejected calls for official aid
because of continued U.S. opposition to Vietnam's 9-year-old
military occupation of Cambodia.

<TEXT>
   The changing face of his home district finally
caught up with Rep. Peter Rodino, an Italian-American who spent 20
terms crusading for civil rights but who is now reluctantly giving
up his House seat to make way for a black successor.
   The New Jersey Democrat, who gained national prominence when he
chaired the impeachment hearings of former President Richard Nixon,
yielded Monday to calls from minority constituents who want one of
their own to represent them.
   Rodino, 78, one of the most senior members of the House and
chairman of its powerful Judiciary Committee, issued a statement
saying he would step aside in January.
   Texas Rep. Jack Brooks, the next ranking Democrat on the
committee the past 13 years, will be Rodino's likely successor.
   ``Chairing that committee would be an honor and a privilege
should my colleagues extend me that opportunity next year,'' said
Brooks, who currently heads the House Government Operations
Committee.
   Brooks would have to be officially named by the Democratic
Steering and Policy Committee and elected by the Democratic Caucus.
Committee members said they expected Brooks to be the next chairman.
   ``It is not without a sense of sadness that I am announcing my
decision to retire from the Congress at the end of this term,''
Rodino said.
   Although he did not mention the demands of blacks and other
minorities, who now comprise the majority in his district, Rodino
had been under increasing pressure to step aside. A host of black
leaders _ most notably Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson _ lauded his record but urged him to make way for what
would be New Jersey's first black member of Congress.
   In his statement, Rodino said, ``I believe that my part of the
journey in this great American experiment is at its end. I feel I
have served my time and a purpose.''
   Rodino arrived in Washington in 1948, a 38-year-old lawyer from
an Italian neighborhood in Newark, N.J., eager to represent the
bustling city in Congress.
   He became an institution in the intervening 40 years: fighting
for liberal legislation, controlling one of Congress' most powerful
committees and helping write into history the downfall of a
president.
   But in those same years, Newark decayed from the heart of the
Garden State into the brunt of jokes. Rodino's political base
eroded, and three black Democrats, including two Newark city
councilmen, announced plans this year to seek his 10th
Congressional District seat.
   Rodino, respected even by those calling on him to retire, had
survived earlier challenges. In 1984 and 1986, he won re-election
even though Jackson went to Newark to lead the retirement calls
himself.
   Backers, both black and white, noted Rodino served as House
floor manager for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1966 and wrote
the 1982 Voting Rights Act. He is an honorary member of the
congressional Black Caucus and has been honored by the NAACP.
   ``Rodino is a good man,'' Jackson told the New York Times in
1986. ``That's not the issue. We can have a good man and black man
from New Jersey at the same time.''
   During his fight two years ago, Rodino hinted strongly he would
retire after another two-year term. He said said he wanted to stay
in Congress to counter the Reagan presidency.
   But, as Rodino began last year to raise campaign funds and plan
for re-election, black and white leaders in his party accused him
of breaking a promise.
   Aides said he wrote the resignation statement in his Capitol
Hill office on Monday, then left for his home. The announcement
brought immediate accolades for Rodino.
   ``I will miss his knowledge and his friendship. He sets an
extraordinarily high standard for whomever will succeed him,'' said
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   Rodino served nearly 20 years as a representative before being
thrust into the national spotlight.
   In 1974, barely a year after his predecessor's defeat in a
renomination battle gave Rodino the Judiciary Committee gavel, the
panel was charged with reviewing Nixon's role in the Watergate
affair.
   The televised proceedings won Rodino respect for his evenhanded
handling of an emerging national crisis. In an interview last year,
Rodino recalled weeping after he and a majority of committee
members voted to deliver articles of impeachment to the full House.
   Nixon resigned before the House voted.
   Rodino also served on the House Iran-Contra committee, which
investigated the Reagan administration's handling of the sale of
arms to Iran and the funneling of profits to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels. He has been harshly critical of the Reagan administration's
handling of the arms-for-hostages debacle.

<HEAD>President Urges Clemency for `Sharpville Six'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan today urged clemency for the
``Sharpeville Six'' in South Africa, saying such action would be
``welcomed by all Americans.''
   The six blacks are scheduled to be hanged Friday for being in a
mob outside a home where a township official was killed.
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, the Justice Ministry said
President P.W. Botha has refused to block the hangings, but added
that any further petitions for mercy would be given ``careful
consideration.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``The
president urges clemency for the Sharpeville Six in South Africa on
compassionate and humanitarian grounds.''
   ``We implore the South African government to respond favorably
to these requests,'' Fitzwater said. ``An act of compassion such as
this by the South African government would be welcomed by all
Americans.''
   ``Our disgust for apartheid has been stated many times, and we
continue to speak out for its total elimination,'' the spokesman
said.
   He said the administration was appealing directly to South
African officials for clemency, as well as making the paublic
statement.
   He said the United States had previously appealed for clemency
in the case through public statements, support of a resolution in
the United Nations and representations at diplomatic talks in
Geneva.
   ``We are making this view known officially as well as publicly
to the South African government,'' he said.

<HEAD>US Official Urges End to Speeding Penalties For States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal official urged Congress Tuesday to
eliminate the penalties that face states whose drivers ignore the
55 mph speed limit, but two senior lawmakers said they are writing
bills that would do just the opposite.
   Reps. James Howard, D-N.J., chairman of the House Public Works
and Transportation Committee, and Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., who
heads the Public Works surface transportation subcommittee, said
they are working on measures that would extend the penalties to
states that have adopted the 65 mph limit.
   States with 55 mph limits can lose up to 10 percent of their
federal highway aid if monitors find that more than half their
motorists are driving too fast. But when two laws were passed last
year allowing 65 mph driving on many rural highways, the penalties
were not extended to roads where states allow the faster speeds.
   ``The states are clearly in the best position to determine where
speed enforcement is needed to enhance safety,'' Diane K. Steed,
chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said
in a statement delivered to Anderson's panel. ``They should be able
to deploy enforcement personnel accordingly, without the threat of
losing federal funds.''
   Lawmakers from the 11 states that have retained the 55 mph limit
have complained that it is unfair for their states to face the loss
of federal assistance while states that permit faster driving
cannot be penalized for motorists speeding on 65 mph roads.
   Anderson said he is writing a bill that would apply the
penalties to 65 mph highways. An aide said the measure could be
ready in a week.
   ``The states simply have no economic incentive to enforce the
speed limit laws on higher speed routes,'' Anderson said of present
conditions.
   During a break in the hearing, Howard said he is shaping a bill
that could roll back the number of miles of roads where 65 mph
driving is allowed, and make it easier for 65 mph states to be
penalized for drivers violating the speed limit.
   ``It's a more dangerous speed,'' he said of 65 mph.

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick Urges Talks to Reduce Soviet Conventional Forces in
Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should give top priority to
negotiating reductions of 50 percent to 75 percent in conventional
military forces in the Soviet Union, and Eastern and Western
Europe, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick also said she believes the United States should
continue restrictions on trade with Moscow in an effort to win
human rights improvements inside the Soviet Union.
   ``So long as the Soviets do not permit the free flow of people
across the borders I do not believe it is appropriate for us to
permit the free flow of goods across borders,'' she said.
   At the same time, she said she is not opposed on principle to
expanding U.S.-Soviet trade ``as long as the trade is profitable to
us and does not subsidize them.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick commented at a hearing of the Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe which was organized to monitor
Soviet compliance with the human rights provisions of the Helsinki
accords.
   She said it was not ``inappropriate'' for the United States to
have signed the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces agreement
eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles worldwide.
   But she said she does not believe that agreements reducing
specific nuclear weapons systems are very important as long as the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies retain superiority in
conventional forces.
   ``I think the top priority of the United States should be to
negotiate real reductions _ 50 percent to 75 percent _ in
conventional forces in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Western
Europe,'' she said.
   The hearing was convened to explore the impact on the nations of
Eastern Europe of the reforms insituted in the Soviet Union by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, general secretary of the Soviet Communist
Party.
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick called those reforms important, said they
should not be belittled and said of Gorbachev: ``I believe his
sincerity cannot be reasonably questioned.''
   ``I think in fact Gorbachev is the kind of man who would like to
dismantle the structure of oppression'' in order to revitalize the
stagnant Soviet economy and retain his nation's superpower status,
she said.
   ``He has made ... significant steps toward the release of
political prisoners and dissidents in the Soviet Union,'' she said.
   ``I think that for both internal and external reasons Gorbachev
has concluded that repression and reliance on force is
undesirable,'' she said. ``What we don't know is how far he is
willing to go.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick said there is relatively little U.S. policy can
do to influence the Soviets as the Gorbachev policies of glasnost
(openness) and perestroika (restructuring) run their course.
   Responding to questions, she said she does not believe that U.S.
negotiators should hold agreement on reductions in intercontinental
strategic nuclear weapons hostage to Soviet agreement to make human
rights improvements.
   ``I'm not personally in favor of using arms reduction to win
concessions in human rights,'' she said.

<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A colorful new English-language tabloid hit the
streets Tuesday in Montreal, the best-served newspaper market in
Canada with six dailies.
   The splashy Montreal Daily News was an instant success in this
bilingual city. Many newsstands sold out of the first press run of
80,000 copies.
   With minority-interest financial backing from Britain's Robert
Maxwell, owner of the London Daily Mirror, the new tabloid features
color pictures and the blue-collar standbys of sport, crime and sex.
   The lead headline was ``OUT _ No Appeal for Turk Refugees,'' a
story about the deportation of 40 Turks.
   The principal owner of the paper is Pierre Peladeau, whose
company Quebecor Inc. also produces Canada's leading
French-language daily, Le Journal de Montreal.
   Peladeau said he was prepared to invest $20 million in the
tabloid in the next five years to firmly establish it in an
English-language market previously monopolized by the serious-toned
broadsheet Montreal Gazette, circulation 196,000.
   The Daily News is the Gazette's first direct competitor since
the Montreal Star folded in 1979. Canada's second-biggest city is
also served by the French dailies La Presse, Le Devoir and Le Matin.
   The Gazette launched a new Sunday edition Feb. 28, but Daily
News publisher George MacLaren said, ``We're not publishing on
Sunday. If the advertisers want to try us, they'll try us anyway.''
   The new paper has an editorial staff of 76, many of whom sipped
champagne as the first issue ran off the presses.
   ``We're starting from scratch, and just about everybody is under
30,'' said business reporter Pierre Goad, 26.

   CBS seems to have reclaimed the top spot in the
news Nielsens as the glow of the Winter Olympics wears off ABC.
   For the week ending March 11, the ``CBS Evening News'' had an
average rating of 11.1 and a 21 share, its second win in a row.
ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 10.2 and a 19 share. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had a 9.4 and 18 share.
   The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   After a lengthy reign at the top of the news ratings last
summer, NBC is now struggling in third, although the close ratings
make the news race virtually a three-way tie.
   ``We're in the middle of a big investigation,'' said NBC analyst
Gerald Jaffe. He said the network is awaiting more information from
Nielsen on the February sweeps before deciding whether the slide is
a result of Nielsen's new people-meter sample or a real decline in
viewership.
   Jaffe pointed out that results from the November sweeps showed
NBC with a distinct disadvantage in local news lead-in. NBC
affiliates had an average rating of 11.5, which ``Nightly News''
improved on, to 11.9.
   CBS had the best advantage. Its affiliates had an average rating
of 12.9, and the network newscast improved on that to 13.1. ABC
affiliates averaged a 12.0 rating and the network broadcast was a
12.3.
   ``Network news is an island in a sea of local news,'' said
Jaffe. ``If the local news is going down, there's not much you can
do to keep the network news from going down, too.''
   If the Winter Olympics helped ABC to first in news, NBC can look
forward to potentially the same boost when it carries the Summer
Olympics.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze
will visit Washington on March 20-23 to continue preparations for a
superpower summit meeting, the Soviet Union said Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze's trip is part of a series of meetings with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to iron out differences on an
agreement to cut the superpowers' long-range nuclear missiles by 50
percent and discuss other disagreements between the superpowers.
   At the end of Shultz's visit to Moscow on Feb. 22, he told a
news conference that Shevardnadze would travel to Washington on
March 22-23. There was no immediate explanation why two days had
been added to Shevardnadze's visit.
   Shultz said he and Shevardnadze directed their arms negotiators
in Geneva to draft verification and other key parts of a treaty on
strategic weapons by the time of Shevardnadze's visit.
   He said is was ``extremely important'' to speed up work on the
treaty if it is to be signed by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and President Reagan during an expected summit meeting in Moscow in
late May or early June.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
information department, told a news briefing Tuesday that
Shevardnadze will meet with Reagan and hold several sessions with
Shultz.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Friday that U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Murphy made no progress in talks with
Shevardnadze on the Middle East conflict, and that the two sides
had agreed to continue the discussion during Shevardnadze's visit
to Washington.

   The White House, pushing for new aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, told congressional leaders today the Sandinista
regime appears to be preparing ``an all-out death blow'' against
the Contras, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Describing a lengthy meeting in which President Reagan discussed
the possibility of a new Contra aid package with lawmakers,
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted national security adviser Colin
Powell as saying: ``The resistance program is on the verge of
collapse. It's only a matter of weeks.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``asked for bipartisan support to keep the
resistance from withering away and to prevent a dismantling of the
infrastructure that supports the Contras.''
   The spokesman said that in the Cabinet Room meeting, ``General
Powell outlined the buildup of Sandindista forces for an offensive
in the Bocay Valley, and it was indicated that Sandinista forces
appear to be preparing to launch an all-out death blow to the
Contras by destroying the supplies now in major Contra camps.''
   ``There was a considerable discussion of this turn of events ..
and the implication that has for the peace process,'' Fitzwater
said. But he stressed that no decisions were reached in the meeting
about how to proceed with a humanitarian aid package.
   ``I think everyone in there agreed it was a time to look forward
and to talk about how to fashion a new package, and let the fights
and arguments in the past stay there,'' the spokesman said. ``There
was no anger. ... Everyone, I think, was intense in the sense that
they think this was a time of decision for the national
government.''
   ``I think it's important to point out that everyone in that
session agreed a cease fire is what we're going after and that if
you get a cease fire, that relieves the tension for lethal aid and
for an awful lot of other kinds of aid,'' he said. ``The important
thing now is the humanitarian package that we could use to meet
their human needs.''
   Reagan, speaking to the Prime Ministers Club earlier, accused
the Sandinistas of practicing religious oppression, particularly
against Jews. He said President Daniel Ortega's government had
aligned itself with Libya, Cuba and the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, talking to reporters
following today's meeting Reagan, reiterated that he would be
willing to reconsider a $30 million humanitarian aid package that
was defeated 216-208 in the House on March 3.
   ``We told the president that we had worked very diligently,
Democrats and Republicans, to put together a package'' which was
defeated, Wright said. ``We would be glad to run it again if they
(the House Republicans) would be of a mind to vote for it.''
   Wright said it would be virtually impossible to suspend House
rules to get a vote on a new package this week, as the
administration wants.
   And one congressional supporter of renewed Contra aid, Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla., said an aid package he has been working on
was ``on hold'' for the moment while aid backers look for a way to
get agreement in the House, always the most problematic hurdle on
the Contra issue.
   Reagan, appearing before the Prime Ministers Club, a group of
approximately 150 supporters of the United Jewish Appeal, said that
among other reasons the United States should support the Contra
rebels is the oppression of Jews in Nicaragua.
   ``Few regimes today so blatantly sanction and practice official
anti-Semitism as the Sandinista communists in Nicaragua,'' Reagan
said. ``The Jewish community has been forced out almost entirely.
Managua's one synagogue has been defaced and firebombed. ... ''
   ``Nicaragua has officially aligned itself with Moammar
Gadhafi,'' he said, ``and, of course, the PLO _ an organization
that has again revealed its true colors, opposing our efforts for
peace and trumpeting its responsibility for a sickening terrorist
attack on a bus carrying Israeli men, woman and children.''
   Reagan said the Sandinistas ``have led the way in sponsoring
anti-Israel resolutions in United Nations. So I think it's time
that some in Congress who want to turn away from the reality of
left-wing anti-Semitism face the facts about the anti-Semitism of
the Sandinistas as well as their ties to the PLO and other
terrorist groups.''
   ``It is the Nicaraguan freedom fighters who are resisting this
kind of moral corruption,'' he said. ``It is the freedom fighters
who are fighting for the political, civil and human rights of Jews
and Christians in Nicaragua.''
   The rebels and the Sandinista government have agreed to sit down
and talk about their 7-year-old civil war on March 21-23 in the
town of Sapoa, Nicaragua, 90 miles south of Managua near the Costa
Rican border.
   Adolfo Calero, a political director of the umbrella opposition
group the Nicaraguan Resistance, is expected to represent the
rebels, and Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, brother of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, is to represent the leftist Sandinista
government.
   Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who was removed as
mediator for the talks, will attend as a witness, along with Joao
Baena Soares, secretary general of the Organization of American
States.

<HEAD>Report Says Cuba Short Of Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A severe dollar shortage forced the Cuban
government to ask Western creditor nations earlier this year to
reschedule its foreign debt over 15 years, including a five-year
grace period, according to an official document made public Tuesday.
   Cuba's inability to meet it debt repayment obligations was
blamed on ``extremely adverse external factors,'' the report by the
Cuban National Bank said.
   The study was obtained by Freedom House, a conservative human
rights group, and copies were distributed at a news conference.
   The authenticity of the report could not be verified
independently but it was similar in style and content to a study by
the same bank several years ago which also was made available in
Washington. At the time, the Cuban government acknowledged that the
report was an official document.
   There has been no report of the outcome of Cuba's request for
debt rescheduling, but Manuel Sanchez Perez, a former deputy
minister of trade in Cuba who defected in 1985, told the news
conference the appeal was unsuccessful.
   Sanchez said that Cuba's dollar shortages stem partly from the
decline in the world market price of oil.
   Under a special arrangement with the Soviet Union, the Kremlin
sells oil on the open market and sends the earnings to Cuba.
   Sanchez said these revenues reached a high of $584 million in
1984 but dropped to $284 million in 1986, the last year for which
figures are available.
   Disputing the report's claim that external factors are
unfavorable for Cuba, Sanchez said Cuba's situation is
``exceptionally good'' compared with other countries because of
Soviet generosity.
   In addition to the oil sales bonus, Sanchez said the Soviets pay
four times the world market price for Cuban sugar. This subsidy
amounted to $22 billion between 1975 and 1985, he said.
   Sanchez listed Cuba's debt to Western creditors at $5.5 billion.
Most of that money is owed to Spain, France, Britain, West Germany
and Japan, he said.
   The report was prepared for a January meeting of Cuba's
creditors in Paris. It described 1987 as ``one of the worst years''
for Cuba because of the combined impact of adverse weather
conditions, the sustained slide of the dollar and ``the dramatic
decrease in imports from the freely convertible currency area.''
   It said a number of industries dependent on these imports
suffered ``diminished performance'' as a result.

   When Katharine Hepburn was starring in the 1934
film ``Spitfire,'' her mother was getting plenty of her own
attention as a ``spitfire'' for her outspoken support of birth
control for women.
   Today, the 79-year-old Miss Hepburn, with her family's
characteristic wit and keen intelligence, has taken on her mother's
cause and become one of Planned Parenthood's staunchest advocates.
   In a tribute Monday night, entitled ``Celebrating Two
Generations of Individual Courage,'' the actress and her late
mother, Katharine Houghton Hepburn, were honored by Planned
Parenthood for their efforts to gain greater reproductive rights
for women.
   ``It's a frightfully important subject,'' the actress told the
1,100 guests gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria for the black-tie
event.
   ``And I'm damn lucky to have had a mother who waked me up at an
early age.''
   Tickets for the gala were priced from $500 to $1,000, with
proceeds going to Planned Parenthood dedicated to the actress'
three priorities: keeping abortion safe and legal, preventing teen
pregnancies and preserving family planning for the poor.
   Former TV anchorman Walter Cronkite, tennis champion Martina
Navratilova, TV journalist Barbara Walters and actor Robert
Lindsay, star of the Broadway musical ``Me and My Girl,'' were
among the participants.
   As guests arrived, they encountered a small protest by the Stop
Planned Parenthood organization.
   Guests rose to their feet and applauded as Miss Hepburn,
elegantly attired in a black pantsuit, approached the podium.
   ``It's so touching to me, I can hardly begin to say what I have
to say,'' she said. But she had much to say.
   ``When a girl becomes pregnant, should she be forced by law to
have this baby? She's 13. She doesn't want it. She can't support
it. Her family doesn't want it. It would seem to me that she should
be allowed to have an abortion.''
   ``By the same token, if an older woman with several children
gets pregnant and feels that she can't support it or care for
another child, I cannot for the life of me see that anyone but this
woman has the right to decide what she's going to do,'' Miss
Hepburn said.
   ``It's certainly much harder to be a woman than it is to be a
man,'' she lamented. ``But men got here first and arranged
everything to suit themselves. And it's taking women a long time to
... try to catch up.''
   Miss Hepburn became involved with Planned Parenthood in 1981.
The group's president, Faye Wattleton, said she recruited her
because she was ``someone who really had the public's respect.''
Her participation in the organization has brought an additional
200,000 donors and supporters.
   It was only after the actress agreed to work for Planned
Parenthood that, Ms. Wattleton said, she learned
``serendipitously'' that Miss Hepburn's mother had been an
outspoken advocate of birth control at a time when it was illegal.
   Mrs. Hepburn worked alongside Planned Parenthood founder
Margaret Sanger more than 70 years ago.
   A member of the Houghton family that founded Corning Glass, she
testified before the U.S. Senate in the 1930s on the need for birth
control, particularly for poor women.
   ``Women want children but they want children they can properly
take care of,'' she testified. She died in 1951 at age 73.

   George Bush bid Tuesday for an Illinois primary
victory that would doom the Republican presidential campaign of
Sen. Bob Dole. Sen. Paul Simon dueled Jesse Jackson in a battle of
Democratic favorite sons that made third place attractive to their
rivals.
   In the first industrial state to vote, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis sought to leave Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Rep.
Richard Gephardt far behind.
   The Illinois primaries included presidential straw polls and
separate elections of delegates to the nominating conventions next
summer.
   Bush, winner of 16 out of 17 Super Tuesday contests last week,
led Dole by huge margins in the pre-election polls in the Land of
Lincoln. He looked for his first primary win on Midwestern soil,
and an increase in his seemingly insurmountable lead in convention
delegates.
   Kansas Sen. Dole spent the day campaigning in Wisconsin and
Connecticut in a demonstration of his determination to stay the
course _ even though he had speculated about withdrawing if he
suffered another big defeat. He said he hoped to win 40 percent of
the delegates at stake during the day.
   Pat Robertson, the former television evangelist campaigning as a
conservative alternative to Bush, said he might quit if he failed
to pick up 5 percent of the vote. ``I'm not Don Quixote and I'm not
going to tilt against windmills,'' he said.
   Simon was rated the slight favorite on the Democratic side as he
sought a victory he said was essential to sustain his candidacy. He
campaigned as the man to represent Illinois at the bargaining table
of what he said would be a brokered Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta.
   But pre-election polls suggested Jackson's popularity among
black voters could propel him to his first industrial-state
victory, and the Chicago-based civil rights activist forecast a
``significant breakthrough.'' He voted at a South Side church in
Chicago.
   Dukakis used a combination of personal campaigning and $250,000
worth of television ads in an appeal to Simon supporters to reject
Simon's strategy of forcing a brokered nomination.
   Dukakis' aides said they would be pleased if that made Jackson
the winner, since a Simon withdrawal would eliminate a rival for
white, liberal support in the next states to vote. Michigan,
Connecticut, Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania all follow next
weekend's Kansas caucuses.
   Simon cast a primary-day ballot in Makanda in southern Illinois
and said, ``We have to win both'' the popular vote and the delegate
contest to stay alive in the race. He said he would do both, and
spokesman Terry Michael predicted the Illinois senator would pick
up 135 of the 173 national convention delegates at stake.
   Dukakis was locked in a close race nationally with Jackson for
national delegate superiority and hoped to establish position over
the field for the Michigan caucuses on March 26. Dukakis' campaign
said he has a reserve of some 100 delegates won in caucuses in
other states that have been held but have not yet been counted.
   Going into Illinois, Dukakis had 462.5 of the 2,082 needed to
win the nomination. Jackson had 423.55, Gore 352.8, Gephardt 145
and Simon 35.5.
   Republicans elected 82 of their 92-member delegation Tuesday.
Democrats picked 113, with an additional 60 to be allocated later
at a state convention on the basis of the evening's results.
   Bush began the day the prohibitive leader in the delegate
competition on the Republican side with 705 of the 1,139 needed to
clinch the nomination. Dole had 165, while Robertson had 17.
   Illinois' separate delegate elections looked like an easier
contest for Simon, although Jackson was expected to virtually sweep
the competition in the predominantly black congressional districts
in Chicago.
   Most of Simon's delegate candidates were well-known figures
locally, and they urged him not to drop out of the race after
earlier primary disappointments, at least partly so they could have
a chance at attending the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
this summer.

   Thus ended the campaign in the first of the industrial states to
vote, a battle that seemed as clear-cut on the Republican side as
it was complicated for the Democrats.
   Bush campaigned like the prohibitive front-runner that he was
after his Super Tuesday rout, in which he won all 16 primary
elections and lost nly a caucus state _ Washington _ to Robertson.
He ignored Dole's repeated demands for a Lincoln-Douglas-style
debate without moderators and began tailoring his campaign to the
independent voters and potential Democratic converts likely to hold
the balance of power in the fall election campaign.
   He seemed to be gently trying to nudge Dole out of the race,
declaring, ``I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.''
   ``I've made a judgment that Illinois, whatever happens, we're
going to keep going,'' Dole said at a news conference on Monday.
But he conceded candidates sometimes fail to understand when it is
time to get out.
   ``Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind
for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little,
somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, his campaign was looking ahead to April 5,
releasing this to the Political Hotline:
   ``On Wisconsin, On Wisconsin, grand old Badger state,
   ``We thy loyal sons and daughters hail thee good and great.
   ``...On Wisconsin, On Wisconsin, fight on for her fame,
   ``Fight, fellows, fight fight fight
   ``We'll win this game.''
   Robertson vowed to stay in the GOP race until the convention in
New Orleans as ``a champion of conservatives.'' But he also said a
finish of less than 5 percent likely would force him to reassess
his vow.
   Bush's Illinois supporters ranged from Gov. Jim Thompson to
Edward Vrdolyak, once the Democratic kingpin of Chicago's Cook
County but now a Republican. And Bush spent $400,000 in television
advertising to boost his vote.
   Dole called Illinois a ``recovery state'' after his Super
Tuesday debacle and paid a memorable visit to the hospital where he
recovered from crippling World War II wounds 40 years ago to
underscore his point.
   But he conceded, ``We're hanging by our fingernails'' and he
staggered through the week. He laid off more than half his staff,
canceled television advertisements and was reported by aides to
have discussed quitting the campaign even before Illinois voted.
   He decided to remain a candidate and gambled on a 30-minute paid
television broadcast Saturday night _ only to fall victim to a
power failure that interrupted his statewide appeal in mid-sentence.
   The Democratic race was fittingly Byzantine in the land where
local politics is a year-round sport.
   Simon was attempting a tough campaign restart _ without funds
for advertising _ after sitting out the 21 Super Tuesday contests.
He urged his home state voters not to desert him in his hour of
need, and said he wanted to represent them at a brokered convention
this summer.
   But Dukakis responded that a brokered convention would be a
``disaster'' for the Democrats and plowed $250,000 into television
advertising in a bid to whittle away at Simon's support.
   Jackson, who won five Super Tuesday states and followed up on
Saturday with a victory in the South Carolina caucuses, said a
victory in Illinois would be a breakthrough _ his first in an
industrial battleground.
   Gore came to Illinois hoping to ride the crest of a Super
Tuesday-generated wave, but it failed to show up in the
pre-election polls. He spent an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 on
television advertising in search of a place to ``punch through'' in
his battle to compete with Dukakis.
   Gephardt, the candidate with political momentum only five weeks
ago when he won the Iowa caucuses, gave short shrift top Illinois.
Aides said he was conserving his cash and his energy for a last
stand in the Michigan caucuses on March 26.

<HEAD>Students Given Taxing Task: Simplifying IRS Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at the University of Akron are aiming
for a breakthrough that has eluded some of the best minds in
government and the professions: a tax form that can be understood
without a college education.
   ``We know it can be done and we're going to prove it,''
Professor Nicholas J. Creme, director of the Center for Taxation
Studies in the university's law school, said in an interview
Tuesday. ``We're not saying we could bring it down to a
second-grade level, but we certainly can make it simpler.
   ``If you simplify the forms, people will be a lot less hostile
toward the Internal Revenue Service,'' he said. ``And you'll raise
a lot more revenue.''
   Creme said about 20 students majoring in law, business or
education will be put to work on the project. Testifying before a
Senate Finance subcommittee Monday, some of the students and their
leaders promised Chairman David Pryor, D-Ark., that most of the
work will be done by September.
   The students got interested after seeing estimates that nine of
10 people with less than a high school education cannot understand
the instructions for the simplest tax form _ the one-page 1040EZ.
That study also determined that it takes less reading skill to get
through a typical issue of the Wall Street Journal than through a
tax form.
   The reasons for the complexity are simple, say Creme and
Professor James W. Childs, director of the university's Tax Clinic.
``The average sentence length of these (IRS) publications exceeds
25 words ... One-third of the words in these publications are
multi-syllabled words.''
   ``By reducing the number of syllables and the number of words in
a sentence we can the forms and instructions significantly more
readable,'' said Creme. ``And we want to change how the forms look
_ change the spacing so things don't look so crammed in.''
   It is not just college students or even high school dropouts who
are having trouble with tax forms. Even tax professionals shake
their heads at some instructions that were prompted by some of the
more complex provisions in the 1986 tax overhaul.
   This sentence, for example, is in the instructions for Form
8598, which up to 1 million taxpayers will have to file this year
to calculate their mortgage-interest deduction:
   ``If you received monthly statements that show either the
closing balance or the average balance for the month, you may
determine your average balance by taking the average of either the
closing balances or average monthly balances shown on your monthly
statement.''
   Creme said participants hope to develop more-readable versions
of the W-4 withholding form; W-2 year-end wages-earned statement;
1099 interest-earned form and the basic 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ
forms.
   IRS forms are developed in consultation with lawyers,
accountants and educators. In changing its forms last year to
reflect the new tax law, the IRS hired a consultant and even went
to some shopping malls for instant reaction from random taxpayers.
   IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek, who helped develop the 1040EZ several
years ago, says that form is written to an eighth-grade reading
level. That does not mean, however, that a typical student in the
eighth grade could understand it, he said.
   ``It means a grownup that understands certain concepts can
understand the form,'' Pyrek said. ``A fourth grader doesn't
understand the concept of taxation, for example, although a
40-year-old with a fourth-grade education who has been on the job
for 20 years probably does.''
   The IRS concedes that many taxpayers find taxes puzzling. The
agency's own statistics show that 46 percent of taxpayers paid

figure out the right answer,'' he said, ``they will take the answer
that gives them the best break.''

   A witness for the prosecution at Gov. Evan
Mecham's impeachment trial said that a defense lawyer tried to
intimidate him with obscene language shortly before he testified,
according to an affidavit released today by prosecutors.
   Prosecutor William French, replying to defense accusations that
witnesses were being intimidated, released an affidavit saying that
defense attorney Fred Craft had himself berated a witness and made
accusations about the sex life of the governor's chief accuser.
   Craft accused state Department of Public Safety of ``a
consistent pattern of an abuse by the police power'' by
intimidating witnesses. ``We are afraid in this state today because
we've got a runaway police state.''
   But French contended that a defense move to dismiss an
obstruction of justice charge was a ``smokescreen'' put up because
the governor cannot disprove it.
   The impeachment allegations against Mecham, a first-term
Republican, include that he tried to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat by then-state prison construction chief Lee
Watkins against a former state official, Donna Carlson.
   Peggy Griffith testified last week that Watkins, a Mecham
confidant, told her that if Ms. Carlson did not keep her mouth shut
about an unreported Mecham campaign loan she might ``go on a long
boat ride'' and come to harm.
   ``It has become apparent that there is no defense'' to the
charge that Mecham tried to obstruct the probe, French said today.
   The Senate voted to take under advisement a defense motion to
either dismiss the obstruction charge or declare a mistrial. A
decision is expected Wednesday.
   The House panel overseeing the prosecution released an affidavit
from state official Antonio Corio, who said Craft made statements
about the alleged sex life of Department of Public Safety Director
Ralph Milstead.
   Milstead has testified Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with
the death threat probe, while Corio testified Friday that he had
been asked to search for listening devices in the governor's office
and found none.
   Craft claimed that Corio changed his planned testimony after
being seen with Milstead, but Corio's affidavit said, ``I contacted
DPS on my own. I have not been tampered with by DPS.''
   Corio's affidavit said Craft used obscene language on Friday in
saying he did not have time to deal with him.
   According to Corio's affidavit, Craft also said to Corio that
Milstead has sex with ``the widows of fallen officers to console
them.''
   Corio also claimed that Craft said that Milstead made DPS bureau
chiefs put on his uniform so they could have sex with him. The
affadivit did not specify the gender of the bureau chiefs alleged
involved, and it also did not indicate whether the conversation was
tape-recorded or how he remembered the quotes.
   Milstead is in Israel for an anti-terrorism seminar, but DPS
spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt called the alleged statements
``disgusting.'' Asked for further comment, he said, ``You can't
print it.''
   Craft indicated in arguments before the Senate that he had seen
the document, but he did not say whether he made the statements or
not.
   On Monday, a former cabinet member and Mecham confidante
testified that a key prosecution witness lied about the alleged
death threat.
   Max Hawkins, who was fired as state Department of Administration
director by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, told the Senate that
Griffith's public statements and testimony about the alleged threat
were ``substantially different'' from what she told him in November.
   ``I think Peggy really detested Lee Watkins,'' Hawkins, a
onetime Mecham campaign chairman, testified. ``I think she really
had it in for Lee Watkins,'' possibly because he had said bad
things about her friend Ms. Carlson before.
   Hawkins repeatedly told the Senate that he did not consider the
alleged threat to be a serious matter. He said the story told to
him by Mrs. Griffith was similar to what Watkins told him: ``People
are excitable out there on both sides and she (Ms. Carlson) could
end up getting hurt.''
   Hawkins said he did not remember Mrs. Griffith telling him
anything about Watkins saying Ms. Carlson could get killed or go on
a ``long boat ride.''
   Sen. Carolyn Walker, a Democrat, chided Hawkins, saying, ``You
hear a threat and you don't have the intelligence to discern a
threat?''
   The defense has accused the Department of Public Safety of
trying to intimidate Terri Fields, a defense witness who testified
she did not believe a death threat was made.
   Ms. Fields, who is Mrs. Griffith's secretary, was arrested
Friday night on a January warrant accusing her of not attending
court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings required after a
drunken driving arrest.
   The DPS has denied attempting to intimidate any witness, but the
FBI began a preliminary investigation Monday into the allegation.
   Mecham, who was impeached by the House on Feb. 5, also is
accused of concealing the $350,000 campaign loan and misusing
$80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   He is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades. A
two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict him.
   Mecham faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of concealing
the $350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.

   Buzzard spotters got a welcome sign of
spring despite today's 20-degree temperatures when two birds
drifted into a park, officially marking their annual return to
Hinckley.
   ``It stopped snowing for a brief moment there, for 20 minutes,
and the sun came out and the birds came drifting in,'' said Ralph
Woinset, a ranger at Hinckley Reservation. ``Capt. Roger Lutz
called in the official sighting at 12:02 p.m.''
   ``They probably would have been in earlier if it hadn't been
snowing, but they have trouble negotiating the snow. By Sunday,
there should be quite a few of them in for the crowd,'' Woinset
said.
   A flock of the large, long-necked black birds supposedly returns
to its northern home at the park's Buzzard Roost each year on March
15. The annual buzzard search began in 1957 in an attempt to verify
the legend that the birds return on the same day each year.
   Lutz, a Cleveland Metroparks ranger captain, agreed that the
annual buzzard news tends to ``build on the tradition,'' but he
discounted the possibility that the buzzards stay in Hinckley
through the winter months.
   ``There's a flock of about 75 to 80 that stay in the Hinckley
area during the year. We believe they fly to Dade County, Fla.,
during the winter ... though it's difficult to verify,'' he said.
   According to local legend, buzzards were drawn to Hinckley in
1819 because of tons of decaying game killed in the Great Hinckley
Varmint Hunt.
   On Dec. 24, 1818, 475 men and boys attempted to rid the
25-square mile community of predatory animals that had been
attacking farm stock. The carcasses froze during the winter and
thawed in the spring, attracting the buzzards.

   Elisabeth Zinser, whose brief appointment
as president of Gallaudet University triggered vehement protests by
deaf people nationwide, said she wasn't bitter about her
resignation.
   ``I'm sad that I'm not going to be able to become a part of that

   She's privileged, too, she said, that she ``had become a key
figure in the playing out of this civil rights movement for deaf

I've accomplished as much as if I had been there for years.''
   Zinser, who is vice chancellor for academics at the University
of North Carolina at Greensboro, N.C., hasn't relinquinshed her
ambitions.
   ``I know that I will be a president some day, but it has to be a
special place. I'm not interested in just throwing my resume all

   A jury awarded the estate of a prematurely born
boy who lived only 24 hours $75,000 for pain and suffering after he
received allegedly negligent treatment from a city ambulance crew.
   The six-member jury also awarded $350,000 to the child's mother,
Marlene Canty.
   The jury had ruled Jan. 15 that the baby was conscious enough to
experience pain and suffering, but city lawyers argued that the
finding was medically impossible and said they would appeal.
   Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Shorter refused on Feb.
29 to overturn the verdict, the Daily News said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Canty, then 21, went into labor in her home two months
early on April 24, 1975. Her husband, Winslow, called the Emergency
Medical Service at least once, possibly three times, according to
conflicting accounts.
   The baby, still in its amniotic sac and moving one appendage,
``lay between the mother's thighs visible to her during the alleged
45-minute delay and negligent treatment ...,'' the judge wrote in
his decision.
   Mrs. Canty said the EMS technician who finally arrived told her
the baby was dead and refused to open the sac.
   ``Finally I asked her (the technician) if the baby was a boy or
a girl,'' Mrs. Canty said. ``At that point she took a small
instrument and slit open the sac. ... She lifted one leg, saw the
gender of the baby, threw the leg down and said the baby was a boy.
... She then picked up the baby, wrapped the baby in the plastic
and threw the baby'' into a cardboard box.
   Mrs. Canty and the baby were taken to Harlem Hospital, where the
infant lived for 24 hours on a respirator.

   The palatial home within the Houston Astrodome is

   Roy Hofheinz, former mayor, county judge and prime mover behind
construction of the stadium, built the six-story apartment,
including a barber shop, game room, bowling alley, putting greens
and a shooting gallery, not to mention a superb view of the playing
field.
   Hofheinz died in 1982, and had not lived in his stadium home

and special viewing boxes. This week the rest will be torn down,
and will become part of a new 15,000-seat area.
   In Hofheinz's master bedroom and drawing room, there are 30-foot
ceilings, gold-plated fixtures, handcarved woodwork and a bathroom
with sunken tub and sauna.
   A slanting floor in the Tipsy Tavern gives guests a feeling
being so before they take a drink. In the apartment's chapel,
changeable windows offered worshipers their choice of a cross, a
Star of David or a Buddhist symbol.
   Hofheinz lived in the apartment off and on from 1965, when the
Astrodome was built, to 1975. He died at age 70.

   Only one man has lived longer on
Florida's death row than Willie Jasper Darden.
   Howard V. Douglas, who turns 52 on March 30, has been on death
row since Dec. 4, 1973. Darden was sentenced to death seven weeks
later and was executed Tuesday.
   Douglas was convicted of killing his ex-lover's husband after
forcing the pair to engage in a series of sex acts while he
watched, court records say.
   Former Gov. Bob Graham signed a death warrant on Douglas for
July 26, 1979, but that was stayed and subsequent legal steps
resulted in the case being sent back to Polk County for
resentencing.
   Douglas was again sentenced to death in August 1985, and the
appeal from that hearing now is with the Florida Supreme Court,
which heard oral arguments in September 1986.
   The court could affirm the death sentence or reduce it to life,
clerk Sid White said Tuesday.
   In the original trial, the jury found Douglas guilty and
recommended life, but the judge imposed the death penalty based on
a finding of no mitigating circumstances. In Florida, jury
recommendations in death cases are advisory, and the final
sentencing decision is up to the judge.
   Although Douglas has been on death row for more than 14 years,
his case could to drag on for years more.
   ``He would have the right to start the process all over again as
far as the new sentence is concerned,'' said assistant attorney
general Richard Martell. ``It's a new death sentence that has not
been reviewed by any court, so he would have a right to take a
petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.''
   Douglas was convicted of killing Jesse W. Atkins on July 17,
1973.
   Atkins' body was discovered by a hunter July 21, and five days
later the victim's wife reported the killing to authorities.
   Helen Atkins later testified she once had lived with Douglas but
returned to her husband following the birth of a baby in June 1973.
   Mrs. Atkins said she and her husband were forced to commit
various sexual acts at gunpoint before Douglas struck Atkins with
the butt of a rifle, then shot him.
   Douglas and Mrs. Atkins returned later to move and cover up the
body. She said went along with Douglas out of fear.

   A homeless man who refused to help his dying
brother until he was offered $1,000 finally submitted to a blood
test Tuesday to determine his suitability as a bone-marrow donor,
blood bank officials said.
   Randy Chapman, 32, who lives on the streets and earns money by
submitting to medical experiments, had initially refused to help
his brother in Indianapolis.
   ``If he dies, he dies,'' Chapman had said. ``He's about as much
a brother to me as you are.''
   But he changed his mind after an anonymous Indiana man who also
suffers from a blood disease offered him $1,000 to take the blood
test.
   Other family members had been tested but were found unsuitable.
   ``I wasn't too proud of myself when I read in the paper what I
had said. I sounded cold, but I guess all my repressed feelings
came out,'' said Chapman, who had not been in contact with his
family in 14 years.
   ``I don't wish my brother any harm. It's just that my family
only wanted me when they needed something from me. Where were they
when I needed them?,'' he said in an interview with The Miami News.
   Chapman submitted to the blood test Tuesday at the American Red
Cross Blood Bank of South Florida, said spokesman Chris Chidley.
   The test will determine if Randy is a suitable match for his
brother, Steve Chapman, 38, who is dying from leukemia.
   If he proves suitable, Randy Chapman stands to gain an
additional $2,000 for donating marrow, the source of blood cells.
   ``I'm glad he did it and I hope it all works out after all this
trouble,'' said the ill brother, Steve Chapman, who is married and
the father of two. ``I just wish he hadn't raised such a ruckus.
There was no sense in doing that. He's a little rough around the
edges, I guess.''
   Steve Chapman was released from St. Vincent's Hospital in
Indianapolis last week after chemotherapy treatment. His disease is
in remission, but he must have the marrow transplant within three
to four months, his doctor says.
   Without the transplant, he will die within two years, said Dr.
Richard Fayssoux.
   The philanthropist said he hopes his offer will not only save
Steve's life, but also help Randy turn his life around.
   ``I hope it works out well for both of them,'' he told The Miami
News.
   Randy said he hopes the money will enable him to give direction
to an aimless life.
   ``I'm planning to do something constructive with my life, rather
than destructive,'' he said. ``I'm thinking about leaving Miami.''

   Ethnic feuding between Sinhalese and
minority Tamils killed 10 more people Tuesday, Indian authorities
said, bringing the two-day death toll to 17.
   Sinhalese attackers dragged away three Tamil bus passengers near
Tampalagama in eastern Trincomalee District and hacked them to
death, according to a representative of the Indian High Commission
in Colombo.
   An hour later in nearby Gomarankadawela, Tamil rebels shot and
dismembered seven Sinhalese, including a child, according to the
Indian-Sri Lankan joint operations command.
   The rebels reportedly belonged to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, who have been fighting for a separate homeland in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka.
   An Indian peacekeeping force of about 50,000 came to Sri Lanka
at the government's invitation to stem such attacks after a peace
accord was signed in July.
   The violence has persisted, however. Sri Lankan and Indian
authorities say 98 civilians have died in Trincomalee so far this
month.
   At least 12 Sinhalese villagers were killed Monday in an attack
by suspected Tamil rebels on the village of Galmetiya, according to
Sri Lankan military officials.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military.
   Militant Tamils have been fighting since 1983 for a separate
homeland. They have rejected the Indian-brokered peace accord of
July, saying it fails to protect their interests.
   India hopes to foster peace in Sri Lanka, an island just off its
southern tip, because an estimated 60 million Tamils live in
India's southern states. Many sympathize with Tamils in Sri Lanka.

   Convicted murderer Willie Jasper Darden went
to his death Tuesday proclaiming his innocence and thanking people
around the world, from Andrei Sakharov to Jesse Jackson, who aided
his 14-year battle to escape the electric chair.
   For the widow of the man he shot between the eyes, Darden's
execution on an unprecedented seventh death warrant offered hope,
finally, for peace of mind.
   ``I think it's long overdue,'' Helen Turman Baum said minutes
after the execution about 7 a.m. at the Florida State Prison. ``He
did it to himself. I'm just thinking right now I want some peace of
mind ... it's been a long time and I'm glad it's finally over.''
   Mrs. Baum has remarried since her husband, James C. Turman, was
killed Sept. 8, 1973, after Turman walked into their Lakeland
furniture store and found his wife being robbed of $15.
   Gov. Bob Martinez also was unmoved about the international
attention Darden attracted, from death penalty opponents and people
who believed his conviction was racially tainted. Darden was black;
Turman was white.
   Among 1,600 telephone calls Monday, the majority protesting, was
one from Jackson, a candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination. Nobel Peace Prize winner Sakharov, actress Margot
Kidder, rock star Peter Gabriel, Amnesty International and other
human rights and religious groups also all called for a halt to
Darden's execution.
   ``I think justice was served today,'' Martinez said later.
``This was not someone out of a choir. He was a career criminal.
This was a man who had a career of violent crimes.''
   It was the 18th execution in Florida and 96th in the nation
since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that states could again
invoke capital punishment.
   Earlier Tuesday, Wayne Robert Felde was executed in Louisiana's
electric chair for the 1978 murder of a police officer. It was the
first time two inmates were executed the same day in the United
States since Aug. 28, when executions were carried out in Florida,
Alabama and Utah.
   Darden, 54, gave a final taped interview Monday with ABC-TV,
broadcast on ``Nightline.'' He had exchanged letters with many
people and had become known as the ``sage of death row'' for the
poetry he wrote as he pressed his claim that he was unjustly
accused and convicted.
   But although he had promised in the ``Nightline'' interview to
be ``hollering `innocent, innocent' '' as he was strapped into the
electric chair, Darden instead offered, without notes, a firm,
evenly delivered, last denial.
   ``I was not guilty for the charge for which I was arrested, and
this morning I tell you I am not guilty of the charge for which I
am about to be executed,'' Darden said to 30 witnesses in the death
chamber.
   ``I say to my friends and supporters around the world: I love
each and every one of you. Your love and support has been a great
comfort to me, and my struggle for justice and freedom.
   ``I go this morning with a clear conscience. I bear no guilt.
I'm at peace with myself, with the world, with each of you. God
bless you.''
   Darden winked and nodded at one of his attorneys just before the
hood was put over his head, and was declared dead at 7:12 a.m.
after 2,000 volts of electricity flowed through his body for two
minutes. Two puffs of smoke rose from his right leg where one of
the electrodes was attached.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, a federal judge and the state Supreme Court rejected
Darden's appeals on his seventh warrant. No inmate on Florida's
death row had ever survived more than three warrants on the same
crime.
   Before dawn Tuesday, 40 people gathered in a pasture across from
the prison. The protesters maintained silence until the execution
took place, then began singing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Court records say that after shooting Turman, Darden ordered his
wife to perform oral sex on him while Turman lay dying a few feet
away.
   A neighbor, Philip Arnold, also identified Darden during the
trial. Arnold, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing
the shooting and the woman's cries. He was shot three times but
survived.
   Death penalty opponents, led by Amnesty International, have said
Darden had an alibi proving his innocence. They claim statements
from a minister and a woman show Darden could not have committed
the murder.
   In Sweden, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the
U.S. Embassy in Stockholm. The Florida Catholic Conference and
bishops in Florida had urged a halt to the execution.
   Darden was born in Snow Hill, N.C., the second of four children.
His conviction record dated to 1964 and included attempted rape.
   Only Howard V. Douglas had been on death row longer _ by seven
weeks. Douglas was convicted of the July 1973 shooting death of his
former lover's husband. His case is currently on appeal.

<HEAD>After Illinois, Democratic Candidates Focus On Michigan</HEAD>

   Richard Gephardt, hoping to regain the
momentum he established in long-ago Iowa, waited for the Democratic
presidential field in Michigan, site of free-for-all caucuses
uncluttered by any favorite-son bias.
   The stakes in the March 26 caucuses were high and the campaign
was already in gear as Illinois voted on Tuesday.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis wrapped himself in
influential endorsements and sought to establish himself as the
Democratic front-runner.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. sought a big-state victory outside his
native South. And Jesse Jackson looked for delegates in a state
that shorted him in 1984.
   Illinois, the first contest post-Super Tuesday, was destined to
leave no deep imprint on the Democratic race, given its two-way
favorite son loyalties to Jackson and Paul Simon. So Michigan looms
as the next big contest, with 138 delegates at stake.
   Gephardt skipped over Illinois and headed straight for Michigan,
a state that would seem tailor-made for his tough-on-trade,
save-the-farms message with its $15 billion agriculture industry
and import-triggered auto industry layoffs.
   Gephardt is hoping the message saves the messenger.
   ``If we don't do well here, obviously we're not going to be able
to continue in this race,'' he told Michigan supporters last week.
   Gephardt was the first to hit the airwaves with a commercial
featuring his tough talk on trade sanctions, his family farm
legislation and an endorsement from elderly champion Rep. Claude
Pepper of Florida. ``From the farms, the factories, the
neighborhoods, comes the yearning for change, and now our cause
finally has a voice,'' the ad says.
   The United Auto Workers support that Gephardt cornered in Iowa
is missing here.
   Unlike 1984, when the union endorsed Walter Mondale more than a
year before the balloting, labor leadership has taken a vow of
neutrality. The word to the rank-and-file has been ``Support the
candidate of your choice.'' The 650,000 Michigan members appear to
have taken that word to heart: their support is fractured.
   Former United Auto Workers president Douglas Fraser, still
popular with the rank-and-file, has endorsed Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, various union locals have donated telephones to
Jackson's phone bank, and other union leaders have asked for
management favors to arrange short-notice plant tours for Gephardt.
   Even Sen. Albert Gore Jr. plays to the labor audience here,
touting scorecards issued by the national AFL-CIO's political
action committee.
   ``I have been a friend of organized labor ... in 12 years in the
House and Senate,'' he said Monday night in Detroit.
   In 1984, the Michigan system left Jackson's delegate winnings
far short of his 16 percent popular vote. Detroit Mayor Coleman
Young actively opposed him and mobilized the city's black vote for
Mondale.
   This time, the Jackson campaign ambushed Young by quietly
winning over the ministers, unionists and party activists that form
the backbone of the Young machine. Young favors Dukakis in this
race, but the mayor is unable to promise the turnout Mondale
enjoyed.
   The Jackson campaign plans no television, instead concentrating
on ethnic radio and making sure the core constituency of black
Democrats knows where to go to vote, said Michigan campaign chief
Joel Ferguson. He said Jackson is also getting a good reception
from white voters in Michigan's campus communities.
   The Gore campaign's goals seem to be twofold: prove a Southerner
can do well in the Rust Belt and siphon away enough votes to push
Gephardt below the 15 percent threshold for winning delegates.
   ``For a modest investment we can take enough votes to cut
Gephardt out of the race,'' one Gore supporter said privately.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had one of the first Michigan campaign
organizations in place, but his future was uncertain.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Insure Businesses in Disturbed Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency proposed to Congress on
Tuesday that it be allowed to offer insurance to U.S. businesses to
help them stay in countries threatened with political turmoil, such
as the Philippines and Haiti.
   But the proposal by the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
prompted Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., to say: ``Wouldn't that be like
offering health insurance to someone who's terminally ill?''
   ``Or like fire insurance on a house that's burning,'' agreed
Craig A. Nalen, president of OPIC, which wants to sell the
insurance against political risks.
   Nalen was quick to add that such policies would only be offered
in consultation with the State Department.
   ``We would not go forward if Molotov cocktails were coming
through the windows of the plant,'' he told the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on economic policy, which Bonker chairs.
   Nalen explained that an insurance policy would be offered in
order to prevent a company leaving a country.
   ``That could be devastating to a country that's in
difficulties,'' he said.
   Bonker offered the Philippines as an example and Nalen suggested
Haiti as another.
   Bonker said the idea needs further exploration.
   In testimony prepared for the subcommittee, Nalen emphasized
that the purpose of the insurance would be to keep the country
concerned economically stable and would be offered only in rare
circumstances.
   ``It is very unlikely that private insurers would be interested
in underwriting the kinds of exposures OPIC would be considering
under this authority,'' he said.
   The new authority would permit the agency to offer insurance to
new or existing companies.
   Nalen said members of his staff also have been discussing
agreements for insurance of U.S. firms operating in the territory
of two communist governments: Poland and Hungary.
   Bonker reminded him of the U.S. law that prevents economic
favors to countries that limit emigration of their citizens.
   OPIC's job is to insure U.S. investors in other countries
against political risks, including war, domestic violence,
confiscation and the freezing of their assets. It also makes loans
for investment.
   Nalen told the subcommittee that in the last three years it had
promoted $8.7 billion worth of investment in 61 countries and
turned a profit of $300 million.

<HEAD>Lawyers In Chambers Case Sum Up Wednesday, Prosecution To Suggest
A Motive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor in Robert Chambers' murder trial
plans to suggest during closing arguments a motive that might have
led him to deliberately kill Jennifer Levin in Central Park, a
source said Tuesday.
   Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein said at the
beginning of the 11-week trial that she would prove Chambers
intended to kill Miss Levin, 18, and that it was not an accident
during rough sex as he claimed.
   She told the jurors that the prosecution is not required to
prove motive and that the real reasons for the killing might remain
forever locked in the defendant's head.
   Other lawyers, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike, agree
generally that juries like to hear a motive when they are being
asked to convict someone on a charge of intentional murder.
   Chambers, 21, is charged with second-degree murder in the
strangulation death of Miss Levin on Aug. 26, 1986. Chambers, a
former drug abuser and Boston University dropout who has been
indicted on burglary charges in another case, admits he killed Miss
Levin but says it was an accident after she attacked him sexually
and hurt him.
   The summations by both sides are expected to take most or all of
Wednesday. State Supreme Court Justice Howard Bell will likely give
the jurors final instructions Thursday before they begin
deliberations.
   Ms. Fairstein said in her opening statement that Chambers'
assertion that the killing was an accident was ``ludicrous.''
   A source said Ms. Fairstein, to emphasize the beating Chambers
allegedly gave Miss Levin before he killed her, might display a
large color photograph of the teen-ager before she died next to a
gruesome morgue picture showing red welts and bruises on her body.
   The judge has said he will instruct the jury to consider every
category of homicide, including two charges that carry no mandatory
minimum sentence.
   Bell said that besides the two types of second-degree murder
which with Chambers is charged _ intentional and ``depraved
indifference'' to life _ he will tell the jury to consider
first-and second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent
homicide.
   During Tuesday morning's court session the jurors watched
Chambers' vidotaped admission for a second time so the lawyers
would not have to interupt their summations to replay it.
   The replaying of the tape had an emotional effect on Stephen and
Ellin Levin, the victim's divorced parents. When Ms. Levin started
crying, her ex-husband hugged her and eventually escorted her out
of the courtroom. They had no comment as they left.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose Trade Sanctions on Haiti To Force Democratic
Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress on Tuesday proposed to
impose a series of trade sanctions on Haiti unless it takes steps
toward establishing what the lawmakers regard as a more
democratically elected government.
   The group introduced legislation to revoke Haiti's 7,500-ton
sugar quota, which enables the Caribbean nation to sell sugar at a
U.S. price-support level more than three times the prevailing world
price; suspends other trade preferences; and directs the United
States to oppose loans to Haiti by international development banks.
   The bill also would formally continue in force the suspension of
nearly $59 million in U.S. aid for Haiti, would impose an embargo
on any arms shipments from the United States, and would express
concern about the growing use of Haiti as a transshipment point for
drugs from South America.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., one of the backers of the
legislation, said the current Haitian regime of Leslie Manigat was
the result of ``fraudulent elections'' held in January and that the
military still rules the nation.
   ``Many Haitian citizens, in spite of the continuing oppression
which they face, continue to work for democracy in their country,''
Gilman said at a news conference. ``We must support them and their
cause, and we should disassociate ourselves from the murderous
thugs who unlawfully usurped the rights of the Haitian people.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., another supporter of the bill,
called for the dismissal of Col. Jean-Claude Paul, the Haitian
military chief.
   D'Amato drew parallels between Paul and Panama's military
leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Both have been indicted in the
United States on drug-related charges.

<HEAD>Pressure Mounts On Pretoria To Spare The Sharpeville Six</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer planned an appeal and
the government agreed Tuesday to hear more calls for clemency for
the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks sentenced to hang in two
days.
   West Germany and Britain joined the growing international call
for mercy for the five men and one woman, who were convicted of
complicity in the 1984 lynching of a black township official.
   ``I am not saying that a sign of mercy will solve the problems
of South Africa but it might be a little signal that human feelings
have not died out altogether,'' West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker told a news coference in Harare, Zimbabwe, where he was
on a state visit.
   President P.W. Botha has rejected all clemency bids for the six,
the goverment said Tuesday. But he agreed to meet Thursday with two
members of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party who oppose
the executions, the South African Press Association reported.
   Also, the Justice Ministry said Tuesday that further petitions
for mercy would be given ``careful consideration.''
   Prakash Diar, attorney for the six, said he would file an appeal
in the Rand Supreme Court on Wednesday to seek a stay of execution.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meanwhile, said she
asked Britain's ambassador to Pretoria to meet with Botha on
Tuesday in another bid for clemency.
   The condemned are Theresa Ramashamola, 26; Mojalefa Sefatsa, 32;
Reid Mokoena, 24; Oupa Diniso, 32; Duma Khumalo, 28; and Francis
Mokgesi, 30.
   They were convicted in the September 1984 killing of black
township councilor Jacob Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 miles
south of Johannesburg.
   No evidence was produced that the six were among those who
hacked and burned Dlamini to death. They were convicted under the
doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds they were responsible
for the killing by being part of the mob that gathered outside
Dlamini's home with the intent to kill him.
   One of the Progressive Federal Party members that Botha planned
to meet on Thursday was Helen Suzman, a member of Parliament who
called the executions ``sheer madness'' in remarks to the body on
Tuesday.
   Suzman said the executions would have have a devastating effect
on international opinion.
   ``What reputation do we have in the outside world anyway?''
responded Joan Hunter, a member of Parliament from Botha's National
Party.
   ``An example must be set,'' Mrs. Hunter said. ``We can't allow
these people to roam the streets and intimidate the moderate black
who is only too willing to negotiate with us.''
   Thatcher said British Ambassador Robin Renwick was given
instructions ``to express my hope that President Botha will see
fit, even at this late stage, to exercise the perogative of mercy.''
   Von Weizsaecker told reporters that the executions would
contribute to the violence and tension in South Africa, where the
system of apartheid gives control of the country to the white
minority.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, also urged Botha to spare the six. The organization
expressed shock that 164 people, only nine of them white, were
hanged in South Africa last year.
   Dlamini's killing came during riots that sparked a two-year
outbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid unrest that left more than
2,000 blacks dead.
   Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors,
considering them collaborators with the white-led government. The
Sharpeville riots were provoked by the local council's decision to
raise rents.

   William E. Belk, one of the Americans
held hostage in Iran, will seek the Republican nomination as
Lexington County clerk of courts in the June 14 primary.
   Belk, 52, who declared his ambitions on Monday, has been working
part-time as a communications officer for the State Department and
is keeping busy with a company he helped found, Counts Rescue
Equipment Co. in Ballentine.
   Belk was working in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979,
when Iranians seized the embassy and took more than 60 Americans
hostage. Fifty-two of them were held 444 days and released on the
day of President Reagan's first inauguration in January 1981.
   Belk's wife died in September 1986, and he since then has worked
in the Sudan, Cyprus and West Germany for the State Department. The
past two months, he has been in Baghdad, Iraq.
   He said it now is time for him to settle down.
   ``I think the Lord is trying to tell me something. Every time I
leave one of these countries, somebody blows them up. So I will try
to find my niche in the United States, hopefully in Lexington
County government,'' Belk said.

<HEAD>Reagan Will Offer Alternative After Vetoing Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will propose an alternative
when he vetoes a sweeping civil rights bill passed by Congress, the
White House said Tuesday.
   The president is scheduled to act on the bill Wednesday.
   The Senate passed the bill 75-14 and the House passed it 315-98,
which are margins substantially greater than the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto.
   The measure is designed to reverse a 1984 Supreme Court decision
that limited the reach of laws protecting women, minorities, the
elderly and the disabled.
   The bill would require entire colleges, school systems,
government agencies and private entities to comply with
anti-discrifminaion laws if any program or activity within them
receives federal money.
   The court decision limited this requirement to the specific
program or activity involved.
   The bill is known as the Grove City bill after the Pennsylvania
college involved in the Supreme Court case.
   Noting that Wednesday is the deadline for vetoing the bill,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ``at the time of
that presidential action we will be offering an alternative
administration proposal for overturning the Grove City decision.''
   ``The president has always believed that the Grove City decision
was a mistake and that the non-discrimination protection decisions
that were available before that decision should be restored,'' he
said.
   As far as the congressional bill is concerned, however, he said,
``We have said all along that we would veto.''
   Reagan has objected to the bill on grounds that it
``dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state
and local governments and the private sector'' and ``poses a
particular threat to religious liberty.''
   ``We think we have a very positive alternative bill that
overturns the Grove decision and also lays out our civil rights
objectives in these areas and states the very important civil
rights principles that we think need to be restored in terms of
preventing discrimination,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said White House officials ``believe that if this
alternative bill has enough support that it would be voted instead
of an override.''
   Fitzwater said the bill would be different from the Republican
alternative that was offered and defeated in the House. He declined
to elaborate.

   Albert Gore Jr. launched his campaign for
Michigan's Democratic caucuses Tuesday by trumpeting the
endorsement of legislative leaders and depicting the race for the
presidential nomination as a decision ``whether or not the
Democratic Party is viable in national elections from here on out.''
   Gore, contending he stands a better chance than his rivals of
attracting independent voters, was looking beyond Tuesday's
Illinois primary _ to Michigan's statewide caucuses on March 26.
   In a news conference near the state Capitol, Gore was endorsed
by the speaker of the Michigan House, Gary M. Owen, the Democratic
leader in the state Senate, Art Miller, and other state legislators.
   ``This is a battle for the future of the Democratic Party, a
battle that will determine whether or not the Democratic Party is
viable in national elections from here on out,'' Gore said.
   He was addressing his familiar appeal for support from ``working
men and women'' to the state's heavily unionized work force,
describing himself upon arrival in Michigan Monday night as a
``friend of organized labor.''
   Gore said he would use existing trade laws to bring down unfair
barriers to trade overseas. However, drawing a distinction with
rival Richard Gephardt's retaliatory policies, Gore pointed to the
Reagan administration as bearing most of the blame for the nation's
large trade deficit.
   ``Now we must acknowledge that 80 percent of the problem is with
our own policies and the policies of the Reagan administration,''
Gore said.
   He pointed to his own 88 percent approval rating by the AFL-CIO
over his career in Congress and said that was particularly
noteworthy since he comes from Tennessee, a state without the
Northern states' tradition of organized labor.
   ``It is a record that's been built up in the political fires and
forces of a right-to-work state,'' Gore said.
   Gore said he backed the rights of states to have such laws
banning compulsory union membership.
   ``I believe in the right to organize,'' he said, but ``what
decisions states make, that's for them to determine.''
   Gore said he hoped to ``substantially exceed expectations'' in
Michigan but refused to predict a victory and said no state was
make-or-break for him. ``We're starting at a point where other
campaigns are ahead,'' he said of Michigan.
   Gore planned to fly to Kansas to campaign Wednesday and Thursday
toward that state's Democratic caucuses March 19. Aides said they
were considering having Gore go Friday to Puerto Rico, where
delegates are selected March 28.
   Larry Harrington, a Gore strategist, described the race in
Puerto Rico as between Gore and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Gore also met privately with Michigan fund-raisers and said his
fund raising has improved greatly since his victories in the South
last week.
   ``It was the difference between night and day before and after
Super Tuesday,'' he said.

   Police investigating murders
blamed on mob warfare arrested 15 men in raids that began before
dawn Tuesday in Calabria, a news agency reported.
   Prosecutors issued 24 arrest warrants for suspects on charges of
criminal association, Italian news agencies reported. By late
afternoon, police had served 15 of them, including three for men
already in prison.
   The ANSA news agency said that seven men were charged in two
murders last year in Villa San Giovanni, a town on the Calabrian
side of the Strait of Messina.
   Reggio Di Calabria province, the southernmost part of the
Italian mainland, has been bloodied by hundreds of murders linked
to the 'Ndrangheta mob in recent years.
   Investigators say mobsters are fighting among themselves for
control of lucrative construction and other public contracts in
underdeveloped Calabria, where the 'Ndrangheta is the local version
of the Sicilian Mafia.

<HEAD>Whites to Live in Black Township for Four Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 black and white
Christians will live and worship together this week in an unusual
attempt to break down the psychological and social barriers created
by apartheid.
   Most of the participants are whites coming from across South
Africa to stay Wednesday night through Sunday in Mamelodi, the main
black township outside Pretoria. About 35 blacks from Mamelodi will
stay in white homes in the capital.
   The encounter, culminating with a community barbecue and and a
church service, will be the largest interracial get-together of its
type in South Africa.
   One of the principal organizers is the Rev. Nico Smith, a Dutch
Reformed minister in Mamelodi since 1982. He moved there two years
ago after becoming the first white permitted by the government to
live in a black township.
   Smith says relations between the races in South Africa are
warped by fear and estrangement.
   ``Since I'm living in the black community myself, I have become
aware of the almost total alienation which has developed between
whites and blacks,'' said Smith.
   ``Apartheid was successful. It brought about what it promised to
do. It separated people,'' he said. ``If people are forced to live
separately they become strangers ... Eventually on both sides they
have certain perceptions are totally different from the real
people. This eventually turns into fear of one another.''
   Smith and other clergymen organizing the four days of
socializing, Bible study and prayer have brought smaller groups of
whites into Mamelodi in the past. They said men and women sometimes
tremble with fear as they enter a township that two years ago was
wracked by violent anti-apartheid protests, political killings and
factional battles.
   There has been some opposition to the encounter from militant
groups in Mamelodi who say whites should be viewed as enemies. A
right-wing white group called United Christian Action sent letters
to Mamelodi's mayor and the commissioner of police asking that the
meeting be banned.
   Smith said some black hosts have expressed fears that they will
be arrested if they participate.
   Most South African blacks know how whites live because they work
at white homes and businesses. Few whites know first-hand how
blacks live because they seldom venture into the townships located
on the periphery of the cities.
   One of the delegates, Eddie Prest, said he has had blacks in his
house near Cape Town many times but has never visited a black home.
   ``The black culture is so set up that they don't invite people
to come,'' said Prest, retired director of a bible study program.
``They'll say, `Why don't you just come,' and I'll say, `I've not
been invited.'
   ``It's just a cultural problem,'' Prest said, ``and also a
logistics problem. Also, it's very hard for an African to have you
home, because of their accommodation, their facilities.''
   The number of black delegates is much lower than the whites,
said Baptist Rev. Kevin Roy, because it is harder for blacks to
take two or three days off work. The main goal, he said, is to
expose whites to the black lifestyle, encourage them to think about
positive action to change the apartheid system, and take their
knowledge back to their communities.
   ``Maybe for four days we will treat them (the white visitors) as
blacks. They will start seeing things from the way we look at
things, not the way they are used to looking at things,'' said Dan
Ramakgadi, a field worker for Koinonia, one of the organizing
church groups.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Foreign Investment In US Shouldn't Be
Discouraged</HEAD>

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress on Tuesday that foreign investors make ``good
corporate citizens'' and should not be discouraged from buying more
U.S. assets.
   Despite statistics showing the United State widening its lead as
the world's largest debtor nation, Greenspan said he had ``very
little concern about the issue of direct foreign investment.''
   ``We will find that foreign investment in the United States will
be a plus,'' even at present record levels, Greenspan told the
House-Senate Joint Economic Committee.
   Greenspan also suggested that a recession is unlikely throughout
the next year. He cited recent positive economic statistics,
including an unemployment rate that fell to 5.7 percent in
February, its lowest level in almost nine years.
   He said the rate could drop further, probably somewhere between
half a percentage point and a full percentage point, before
triggering an increase in inflation.
   Greenspan said foreign investments flowing into this country now
from Japan and from Europe are a direct consequence of the large
sums of money the United States spent in those areas in the
aftermath of World War II.
   He testified as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
current account deficit _ the broadest measure of foreign trade _
surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987. The figures add trade in
services and investment flows to other export and import numbers.
   Greenspan said direct investment in the United States by
foreigners was preferable to them putting their dollars _ amassed
through the trade imbalance _ into ``short term liquid holdings.''
   Greenspan was asked by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., whether he
was troubled by the extent of the growing foreign investment in the
United States, particularly by Japanese companies. ``Japan is
buying America and leasing it back to us,'' D'Amato suggested.
   ``On the contrary, the integration of the world economies ... is
inevitable...and is a desirable trend,'' the Fed chief said.
   Greenspan said that foreign-owned businesses in the United
States had become ``good corporate citizens in the localities in
which they chose to locate.''
   He noted that in terms of direct investment _ excluding
government securities _ U.S. business holdings overseas remain
about $50 billion above holdings by foreigners in this country.
   In terms of U.S. Treasury securities, foreign investors held
16.4 percent of the total at the end of last year, Greenspan said.
   Greenspan also:
   _Urged Taiwan to do more to reduce its trade surplus and bring
its economic and monetary polices into equilibrium with the United
States and other major trading partners.
   _Said the British government took the ``correct action'' in not
seeking to stem the recent sharp rise of the pound through heavy
central-bank intervention.
   _Praised Japan for taking steps to stimulate its economy, but
said that steps with a similar goal taken by West Germany have not
been as successful.
   _Said the Fed is keeping in close contact with the White House
and the State Department on the current turmoil in Panama. The Fed
maintains an account for the government of Panama in the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, Greenspan said.

   Bishop Eugene A. Marino, named Tuesday as the
first black Roman Catholic archbishop in the United States, said
his appointment as head of the Atlanta archdiocese is ``a great
sign of hope to all our people.''
   The appointment by Pope John Paul II comes more than two years
after Marino and other black bishops wrote a pastoral letter
calling on the church to increase the number of blacks in official
positions.
   ``The church has spoken but has the church listened to itself?''
said the letter, suggesting that in the absence of a major
appointment such as a black archbishop in a big city, ``the
church's commitment to black leadership may be seen as half-hearted
and superficial.''
   The Atlanta archdiocese has only 10,000 blacks among its 156,000
Catholics. Of 52 million Catholics nationwide, 1.3 million are
black.
   Marino said he could see in his appointment ``a sign of hope to
all men and women of good will that the church recognizes its
wealth within its own ranks ...''
   ``I think that this appointment is a sign of hope to all
minorities that the church in general'' and the pope in particular
are sensitive to the needs of blacks, Marino told reporters.
   Marino, 53, is one of 12 black bishops in the United States and
has served as an auxiliary bishop in the Washington, D.C.,
archdiocese since 1974. In 1985, he was elected secretary of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the first black to hold an
office in the organization. He is a member of the Society of St.
Joseph, formed in the late 1800s to work in the black community.
   Marino's selection was hailed by an advocacy group as an
outstanding appointment.
   Calling him ``quiet, but effective,'' Walter T. Hubbard, acting
executive director of the National Office of Black Catholics, said
Marino ``is a pastoral man and he is sensitive to the needs of lay
people, especially the needs of black Catholic lay people in the
country.
   ``We have optimism that the church is showing us signs of being
responsive to the call by black Catholic lay people for black men
to be elevated to positions of authority and responsibilty,''
Hubbard said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   Hubbard noted that Marino has represented the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops in congressional hearings,
testifying about the needs of the unemployed and the homeless and
for voting rights.
   Marino said his appointment did not necessarily make him the
church's spokesman on civil rights, despite Atlanta's historical
position in the civil rights movement.
   He also declined to be labeled an activist priest, saying he was
``not one to dodge issues; at the same time I am not one to go out
and look for issues for issues' sake.''
   Marino, a native of Biloxi, Miss., said he hoped to be able to
expand black membership in the Catholic church.
   ``We (black bishops) feel that this is a good time for our
sisters and brothers to come forward with their gifts to enrich the
church,'' Marino said.
   ``We have a rich tradition of spirituality in the
African-American tradition ... but it is not a rich tradition that
enriches the Catholic church, unfortunately,'' he said. ``Our
people tend to be religious, our people tend to be spiritual, but
they do not tend to be predominantly Catholic and we feel that
being Catholic is something special.''
   After meeting with some of the 200 priests in the archdiocese,
Marino led a noontime mass at the Cathedral of Christ the King
before returning to Washington.
   Marino will be formally installed May 5, to succeed Archbishop
Thomas A. Donnellan, who died last Oct. 15.
   The Atlanta archdiocese covers 69 counties in north Georgia and
has some administrative responsibility for Catholic dioceses in the
rest of Georgia and in North and South Carolina.

<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci met
with his Soviet counterpart Tuesday, hoping to prod Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov into providing concrete evidence of a new
Soviet military doctrine.
   Carlucci, speaking to reporters en route to meeting Yazov in
Bern, said that despite publicity surrounding the Kremlin doctrine
of reasonable or defensive sufficiency, he had seen ``absolutely no
practical change.''
   ``If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue
to modernize,'' Carlucci said.
   Yazov, who also arrived in Bern on Tuesday for the opening of
the three-day session, said before he left Moscow that he hoped for
a ``frank, constructive discussion'' on arms control issues
including strategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and
conventional weapons.
   Carlucci emphasized that he did not want the meeting, the first
business session between U.S. and Soviet defense secretaries, to
open a ``parallel channel'' to ongoing superpower arms negotiations
in Geneva.
   Yazov and Carlucci were attending a dinner by Swiss Defense
Minister Arnold Koller on Tuesday night, and were to sit down for
formal talks on Wednesday and Thursday.
   Yazov and other Soviet officials have said they are moving
toward a new doctrine, relying on defense. But Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, Yazov, and other military and civilian
commentators have offered different versions of the doctrine,
puzzling Western analysts.
   ``I'm still not sure what it is,'' said Carlucci. ``That's a
question, by the way, I intend to ask him.''
   If Yazov wants to prove that the Kremlin is moving from an
offensive to a defensive posture, said Carlucci, he should seek ``a
slacking off in tank production, in artillery production, maybe
desisting from highly accurate follow-on systems like the SS-18''
intercontinental ballistic missile, which carries 10 nuclear
warheads.
   U.S. negotiators have raised all those issues in the Geneva
talks, but it is not clear when agreements may be reached to cut
strategic and conventional arsenals.
   Carlucci said U.S. analysts were looking for unilateral Soviet
action to define the new Kremlin doctrine.
   ``One of the most important indicators, I would think, would be
tanks. But tanks continue to pour out. So there is no indication at
the other end of the pipeline that there has been any change,''
said Carlucci.
   Yazov, in remarks reported from Moscow by the official Soviet
news agency Tass, said nothing about the doctrine.
   ``The goal'' of the session, he said, ``is to facilitate the
search for ways of resolving the most acute and immediate issues of
strategic offensive weapons and the (1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile)
treaty, reduction of the armed forces and conventional armaments in
Europe, termination of nuclear testing, and prohibition and
elimination of chemical weapons.''

   The two people whose identification and
testimony sent Willie Jasper Darden to the electric chair expressed
relief Tuesday that their ordeal had ended but anger that it had
taken so long.
   ``I think it's long overdue,'' said Helen Turman Baum, whose
husband, Jim, was shot dead in front of her in 1973. ``I need to
get on with my life. ... He (Darden) put me through torture. No one
knows what I have suffered through his hands. ... It is torture
when you see a loved one shot down in front of your eyes.''
   A 16-year-old boy who came to her aid in the Turmans' Lakeland
furniture store was shot three times but survived.
   ``Justice has finally prevailed,'' Phillip Arnold said at the
Tampa asphalt company where he works. ``But it wasn't as swift and
efficient as it's supposed to be.''
   While death penalty opponents and Darden supporters said his
execution Tuesday meant the judicial system had failed, the
prosecutor, C. Ray McDaniel, criticized the length of the legal
battles ``and the unnecessary waste of legal and judicial manpower
that went into the case.''
   ``Those opponents of the death penalty simply hitched their
wagon to the wrong mule,'' said McDaniel, now a private attorney in
Bartow. ``I wish 10 percent of their efforts and the money spent
could have gone to the victims. ... Mrs. Turman's life was ruined
... because of this.''
   Mrs. Baum, 59, remarried four years ago.
   She was making breakfast and hurrying to take her husband, Fred
Baum, to a doctor when she was called by a friend and told that
Darden had been executed. She cried a little.
   Arnold and Mrs. Turman rejected recent statements by a Baptist
minister and a Lakeland secretary, who disputed testimony about the
attack. Their statements provided ammunition for Darden and
supporters who said he had been wrongly identified as the killer.
   ``I identified him several days later (after the crime) because
his face stood out to me. I know in my heart it was him,'' Mrs.
Baum said.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind. There never has been,'' said
Arnold.

   As summer edges over the horizon, millions of
Americans are contemplating exercise programs to help get into
shape after a winter spent as couch potatoes; health experts also
advise watcing the diet carefully.
   The American Dietetic Association has declared March to be
National Nutrition Month, and is urging people to make good eating
a personal way of life, not a dreaded prescription.
   ``We want everyone _ men, women and children of all ages _ to
grasp one critical message: It's never too late to start reaping
the benefits of healthy food choices,'' the association said in a
statement.
   Federal health officials, too, stress the importance of good
diet, noting that food choices can be a major factor in having a
healthy heart, avoiding cancer and in feeling well generally.
   To help, a variety of federal agencies have put together
booklets which can be obtained from the Consumer Information
Center, Pueblo, Colo., 81009. Among them are:
   _ ``Planning a Diet for a Healthy Heart,'' item 521T, no charge.
   _ ``Diet, Nutrition and Cancer Prevention: The Good News,'' item
517T, no charge.
   _ ``Diet and the Elderly,'' item 516T, no charge.
   _ ``Food Additives,'' item 518T, no charge.
   _ ``Nutritive Value of Foods,'' item 119T, $2.75.
   _ ``Some Facts and Myths About Vitamins,'' item 523T, no charge.
   _ ``A Word About Low Sodium Diets,'' item 525T, no charge.
   Generally, improving the diet should be done gradually, not all
at once, says the Dietetic Association.
   Set realistic goals and try to plan a diet with as much variety
of food as possible.
   Many very-low calorie diets can create potential problems by not
supplying enough nutrition. In addition, while these
semi-starvation diets may promote quick weight-loss, they don't
promote a change in eating habits, so the weight is rapidly
regained, the dietetic group points out.
   While many folks shy away from making sudden, major changes in
their eating habits, the Dietetic Association says it can be simple
to take small, healthful steps throughout the day.
   It's easy to skip breakfast in the morning rush, for example. So
how about planning ahead by preparing breakfast the night before,
including such foods as fruit juice, a whole-wheat bagel, yogurt or
perhaps a banana.
   Even if lunch means a business gathering, most restaurants offer
dishes that are low in fat and cholesterol, such as chicken or fish
or moderate portions of beef, as well as fresh steamed or raw
vegetables.
   The association suggests ordering salad dressing on the side so
you can control the amount put on the salad. If dessert is needed,
consider fresh fruit or split a dessert with a friend.
   Smart snacking doesn't mean going without, the group adds.
Snacks can include unsalted nuts, plain crackers, low-fat yogurt,
seltzer water, fruit juice or ice water with lemon.
   Popcorn _ leaving off the salt and butter _ also can make a good
snack, as well as celery and carrot sticks or pieces of zucchini or
green pepper.

   An Irving Berlin tribute on the composer's 100th
birthday, May 11, will star an array of classical and popular
musicians ranging from Leonard Bernstein to Willie Nelson, from
Isaac Stern to Frank Sinatra.
   The tribute at Carnegie Hall will, at Berlin's request, benefit
the Carnegie Hall Society and the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers Foundation, ASCAP's Ken Sunshine announced
Tuesday.
   Sunshine said the gala will be taped by CBS-TV and a broadcast
date will be announced later. Don Mischer will be executive
producer for the network.
   Berlin is the last surviving founding member of ASCAP, which
began at a dinner at Luchow's Restaurant on 14th Street in
Manhattan in 1914. Composers present, including Berlin, Victor
Herbert, Jerome Kern and John Philip Sousa, decided to form an
organization to protect their copywrights.
   Tickets to the concert and a ``Top Hat, White Tie and Tails''
dinner-dance afterwards are $1,000. Tickets to the concert only are
$250, $100, $75 and $50. The Carnegie Hall box office, taking its
cue from Berlin's ``Easter Parade,'' will start selling tickets on
Easter Sunday.

<HEAD>Bill To Be Changed To Avoid Discrimination Against Religious
Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate sponsor of a $2.5 billion child
care bill said Tuesday he will change it to address complaints that
it discriminates against religious groups who provide some of the
nation's best child care.
   ``Within the next week or so we are going to resolve that
issue,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of the Act
for Better Child Care or ABC bill. ``These concerns will be
resolved to the satisfaction of all.''
   The bill, which has 37 Senate co-sponsors, would provide grants
to nonprofit agencies to expand child care as well as money for
child care certificates to working parents with incomes below a
certain level.
   It would deny funding for ``any program or activity that has the
purpose or effect of advancing or promoting a particular religion
or religion generally.'' And it would cancel a Civil Rights Act
provision allowing religious institutions to hire employees on the
basis of religion.
   John Carr, an official with the U.S. Catholic Conference, said
his group supports the goals of the ABC bill and other child care
legislation before Congress but objects to those two provisions.
   ``We are working with the sponsors to see if the church-state
problems can be resolved,'' Carr, the conference's secretary for
social development and world peace, said in an interview. ``Much of
the child care now provided is provided in churches and by
religious groups, and we don't want to see an effort to broaden
quality child care exclude those groups. We're quite hopeful a
solution can be found.''
   The ABC bill was discussed at a hearing Tuesday before the
Senate Labor and Human Resources subcommittee on children, chaired
by Dodd.
   Lawmakers across the ideological spectrum are reaching agreement
that the nation needs more, better and expanded child care services
to address what Sen. Orrin Hatch called ``a bipartisan problem of
families.'' The major points of contention are over how much to
spend and whether states or the federal government should regulate
day care.
   Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed a somewhat different and less
expensive approach to the problem. He said the ABC bill's price tag
is prohibitive while its licensing requirements and religious
provisions seem to discourage home-based care and participation by
religious institutions.
   Dodd said the bill's sponsors are ``strong supporters of home
care. We just want to see minimum standards'' for day care workers,
homes and centers. He said the religious problem would be worked
out.
   The only witness against the bill was William Bentley Ball, a
Harrisburg, Pa., lawyer representing the Association of Christian
Schools International, an organization of evangelical Christian
educational institutions including 1,000 preschools. Ball said the
schools on principle would not take federal money, but said parents
otherwise eligible for aid should not be penalized for sending
their children there.
   Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, who opposes any federal
encouragement of day care, led a protest outside the building where
Dodd was holding his hearing.
   In the February edition of her monthly newsletter, Schlafly
referred to the Dodd bill as an attempt to ``sovietize the American
family by warehousing babies in government-licensed institutions
where they would be subjected to secular, unisex custodial care by
government-trained personnel, while their mothers would be trapped
full-time in the paid labor force.''
   Debra and and Michael Brooks of Gunnison, Colo., presented a
different view inside the hearing room. The couple's first child
was killed when his day care provider _ a woman with no training
and little experience _ struck him on the head. The woman, now in
prison, was ``not a stranger. I considered her a friend,'' said
Mrs. Brooks.
   Her husband said the experience shocked him into realizing that
his government was not monitoring or regulating child care. ``I had
no idea of the things that could go wrong,'' he told Dodd. ``I
trusted in a system that simply didn't exist.''

   Sen. David Karnes said Tuesday that he had
reprimanded a member of his staff who met with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   Baker Spring, a foreign policy assistant for the Nebraska
Republican, met with Arafat in Baghdad during a trip to Iraq in
January. Karnes said he was not aware of the meeting before it
occurred. Details of the two-hour meeting became public earlier
this month.
   Spring went to Iraq under the sponsorship of a private group,
the National Council of U.S.-Arab Relations, and Karnes said he
approved the eight-day trip because it ``provided an opportunity
for expanding trade with Iraq.''
   However, the meeting with Arafat was not on the agenda, and
Karnes said he would not have allowed Spring to go if it had been.
Karnes said the meeting was arranged after the group already was in
Iraq and that Spring had no opportunity to contact him.
   ``Meetings with known terrorists serve no purpose whatsoever,
and should never be held,'' Karnes said in a statement released
from Washington.
   Karnes, named to the Senate a year ago by Republican Gov. Kay
Orr after the death of Democratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky, faces a May
10 primary battle against Rep. Hal Daub. Former Gov. Bob Kerrey is
favored to win the Democratic nomination.

   Wayne Felde, who claimed post-Vietnam War
stress drove him to murder a rookie policeman, died in Louisiana's
electric chair Tuesday after delivering a cryptic two-sentence
message to those who watched him die.
   ``You can kill the messenger but you can't kill the message,''
he said slowly and matter of factly, giving three reporters
separated from him by a glass window time to write down each word.
``Sooner or later, you have to acknowledge it for what it means,
not for what you want it to mean.''
   The 38-year-old killer was then led by four guards a few steps
from the microphone to the big oak electric chair. Four alternating
jolts of 2,400 volts and 500 volts of electricity were administered
over one minute. Doctors pronounced him deat at 12:14 a.m.
   Felde died for killing Officer Glen Tompkins in 1978, as Felde
was being driven to jail in Shreveport. Felde had been picked up on
a drunkeness charge and apparently had not been throroughly
searched. He pulled a gun from his clothes and shot three times
through the front seat.
   Three Shreveport officers joined the few pro death penalty
demonstrators who come to the remote prison each time the state
schedules an execution.
   ``Justice is being done tonight,'' said Sgt. Glenn Ramsey. ``I
hate it. It took 10 years.''
   Cpl. Joe Feconda, who drove Tompkins' widow home from the
hospital after the shooting, said he is still haunted by the
memory. A third officer declined to be identified.
   Felde was captured the night of Tompkins' murder when a lawman's
shotgun blast brought him down. Scars from the blast could be seen
on the lower right side of his chest as his body was examined in
the electric chair.
   Warden Hilton Butler told reporters shortly before the execution
that Felde did not desire or expect a last-minute stay of execution.
   At his 1980 trial, Felde asked the jury that convicted him to
recommend the death penalty, ``or other deaths will result.'' But
he later helped in appeals that delayed his execution for eight
years.
   Felde had enlisted in the Army at age 18 and was sent to war in
1967. The experience, he claimed, left him unable to tell right
from wrong.
   Felde's lawyers had hoped Gov. Buddy Roemer _ who took office
about 12 hours before the electrocution _ would grant Felde a stay
and a new Pardon Board hearing. But Roemer, who had said last week
he had no plans to delay Felde's death, decided against stopping
the execution after meeting late Monday with Bill Quigley, a lawyer
for Felde.

   The headmaster of the Governor French Academy is organizing a
National Slide Rule Museum in this southwestern Illinois city as a
shrine to the device, made virtually extinct by the onslaught of
the pocket calculator in the early 1970s.
   ``The thing that frightens me to death is that we seemed to have
gotten along a whole lot better with these than we are getting
along with the computer,'' said Paeltz.
   ``It was the slide rule that put together `E equals mc squared'
and it was the slide rule that put together the beginning of the
space program. Much of what we talk about as America's pre-eminent
technical position was all computed on slide rules.''
   Paeltz yearns for a return to pre-calculator days and thinks
many schools put too much emphasis on machines.
   ``A slide rule is slower, but I wonder if it doesn't have some
very beneficial things. When there is something physical as well as
mental involved in a process I think people remember things
better,'' Paeltz said.

   There was only one thing the Bi-State
Development Agency could give Edna Schroeder to commemorate her
retirement.
   The 73-year-old woman, who took public transportation to her
downtown job for 55 years without missing a day or arriving late
for work, received a lifetime bus pass in honor of her retirement
last month.
   Schroeder, who worked the whole time for Norcliff Thayer Inc.,
the maker of Tums, said she used to ride the street car before the
bus came along. She said she never owned a car.
   ``We at Bi-State take great pride in the fact that all that time
you used the bus,'' said Raymond Jurkowski, Bi-State's deputy
director.
   Schroeder said she would use the pass presented to her Monday to
``ride the bus to places I've never ridden to before.''

   Bennion Elementary School Principal Ken
Higgins has paid ``deerly'' for doubting his students' reading
capabilities.
   The principal spent Monday's lunch periods locked in a Utah
Division of Wildlife deer cage for losing a bet that students could
not do 500,000 pages in outside reading. They ended up last week
more than doubling that goal.
   After students hit an original target of 250,000 pages quickly,
Higgins raised the goal to 500,000 and offered a pizza party for
the class that came up with the best penalty for Higgins.
Eventually, he boosted the target to 1 million pages, a mark the
students hit last week.
   ``What was really neat was everyone was into the project,'' he
said.
   ``I was really nervous,'' he said about spending 90 minutes in
the cage, ``but it worked out well. And the important thing was it
got the kids reading.'' He spent the time chatting with students
and reading to the younger students.
   Higgins isn't done yet, however. One of the winning class
suggestions was a ride in a hot air balloon. High winds Monday
grounded the plans, but the tire company that owns the balloon
agreed to return when Higgins can take the trip.
   The principal acknowledges a fear of heights, but has vowed to
complete the agreement. ``I couldn't live with myself if I didn't
do what I said I would do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Surges To Record $160.7 Billion In 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987 as America
fell deeper into debt to the rest of the world, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
   The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higher
than the 1986 deficit of $141.4 billion and marked the fifth
consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record.
   The Reagan administration has sought to downplay the
significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend
that the rapid buildup of foreign debt could eventually topple the
country into another recession, triggered by a plunge in the value
of the dollar.
   ``The increasing indebtedness of the United States is the most
insidious and potentially damaging long-run problem the country
must deal with,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co.
   The current account is the broadest gauge of America's dealings
with other countries because it measures not only the flow of
merchandise across U.S. borders but also the flow of services,
primarily investment earnings.
   For 16 of the past 17 years, the country has run deficits in the
merchandise trade category. But the current account was in surplus
as recently as 1981 because Americans' earnings on overseas
investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.
   But in this decade Americans have handed over billions of
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming
the country from the world's largest creditor to the world's
largest debtor nation.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments than
Americans hold in foreign investments. America was last a net
debtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a foreign debt
of $111.9 billion. That debt grew to $263.6 billion at the end of
1986.
   Based on Tuesday's current account statistics, Jeff Faux,
president of the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the U.S.
foreign debt now totaled $424.2 billion, more than four times the
burden of the previous debt leader, Brazil.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and other administration
officials have argued that the country's debt status was not a
cause for alarm because the debt was still a tiny fraction of the
total U.S. economy.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before
Congress on Tuesday, said the fact that more and more U.S. assets
are being acquired by Japanese and other investors was a plus for
the U.S. economy, providing American jobs.
   But private economists argue that the increase in foreign
investment means that more American assets will be flowing into
foreign hands in the years ahead to service the growing debt,
lowering American standards of living and leaving the country
increasingly vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.
   ``The most profound and enduring legacy of the Reagan period is
its conversion of the United States from the largest creditor
country in the world to the largest debtor,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
``As long as the United States has to rely on foreign financing of
such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a
sharp turndown in our economy.''
   Bergsten said that America endured two such turbulent episodes
in early 1987 and again in the fall when weakened foreign
confidence sent the value of the dollar plunging and U.S. interest
rates up sharply. The last such event has been blamed as a
contributing factor in the record collapse of stock pricesd which
occurred on Oct. 19.
   The new report on the current account showed that the trade
deficit actually narrowed somewhat in the final three months of the
year, dropping to $39 billion, compared to record quarterly deficit
of $43.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting higher American
earnings abroad because of the decline in the value of the dollar.
   But this improvement did little to shrink the deficit for the
year, an imbalance reflecting a continued worsening in merchandise
trade and a shrinking of the investment surplus.
   The merchandise trade deficit, on a current accounts basis,
totaled $159.2 billion last year. Adding to that deficit were U.S.
foreign aid and other government transfer payments totaling $13.5
billion.
   The deficit was lowered slightly by a surplus of $12 billion in
the service category. While foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments, the payments still show a slight surplus in America's
favor because many of the older U.S. investments are earning a
higher rate of return.
   Economists said the $12 billion surplus in 1987, down from $18.6
billion in 1986, will shrink even more in 1988 and by 1989 will
drop into a deficit, further complicating the country's efforts to
reduce its trade imbalance.
   Bergsten estimated that total U.S. debt held by foreigners would
rise to around $700 billion to $800 billion by 1995, requiring net
interest payments of around $25 billion annually.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-altitude ozone, which protects humans
from skin cancer, shows an unexplained thinning of about 2.3
percent since 1969 over mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere _
an area that includes most of the United States, scientists said
Tuesday.
   The decline, which is at least twice as large in winter at high
latitudes, was almost certainly the result of human use of
ozone-destroying chemicals, the researchers said in what is
believed to be the most definitive report on ozone concentrations
to date.
   Ozone, a pollutant at ground level, makes possible life on earth
by blocking the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun at high
altitudes. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that
every 1 percent decline in ozone overhead means an eventual
increase in skin cancer of 5 percent to 6 percent.
   Satellite data from 1978 on are consistent with a similar
shrinkage in the Southern Hemisphere, according to the report of a
panel assembled by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The satellite data show a similar unexplained decline in ozone
around the middle of the globe in both hemispheres of about 0.5
percent to 1.8 percent from 1978 to 1987. The actual decline is
larger, about 2.5 percent, but most of it results from variations
in the output of the sun, the panel said.
   ``At this point there is no other culprit to blame'' but the
chlorofluorocarbon compounds, said Sherwood Rowland of the
University of California, Irvine, and head of a panel subcommittee.
``We have taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed to
affect ozone.''
   The Senate on Monday approved, 83-0, a 31-nation treaty calling
for 50 percent cuts by 1998 in production of chlorofluorocarbons,
which are used for refrigeration fluids, cleaning solvents and foam
blowing agents.
   Since 1985, there have been several reports of ozone decline
worldwide in addition to the well-established ozone ``hole'' over
Antarctica _ a 50 percent decline in springtime, followed by
recovery.
   But the reports have not been widely accepted because of such
problems as out-of-calibration satellite instruments or failure to
account for the solar cycle.
   The NASA panel of more than 100 scientists, convened 17 months
ago, went back to the original data, analyzing possible errors in
observations, cross-checking ground and satellite observations and
making particular use of ground data taken when a satellite was
overhead.
   It particular, it tried to estimate the effect of the 11-year
solar cycle, which could decrease ozone by 0.7 percent to 2.0
percent in the period in question, and the effect of the two-year
cycle of upper atmosphere winds.
   The northern mid-latitude decline was estimated from
ground-based data taken by stations mostly in the United States and
Europe. There are too few stations at high latitudes, in the
tropics or in the Southern Hemisphere, the panel said.
   The decline reached 8 percent at the highest latitudes studied
in January, averaging 6 percent in winter, and at higher northern
latitudes ``limited data suggest that there has been a decrease
comparable in magnitude,'' the report said.
   The agency's computer models predicted only a 4 percent to 5
percent peak decline, and researchers are asking, ``Can we believe
our models?'' said Robert Watson, NASA's chairman of the ozone
panel.
   Estimated average year-round ozone declines from 1969 through
1986 were reported from ground-based data for three bands in the
Northern Hemisphere: latitude 30 degrees (about the latitude of
Houston, Texas, Cairo and Shanghai) to 40 degrees (Philadelphia and
Madrid), down 1.7 percent; 40 degrees to 53 degrees (Edmonton,
Alberta, and Berlin), down 3.0 percent; and 53 degrees to 64
degrees (Fairbanks, Alaska, and Reykjavik, Iceland), down 2.3
percent.
   No estimate was presented for all three bands as a whole, but
Rowland said the simple mean average of the three, a 2.3 percent
decline, would be close.
   Each estimate contains a margin of error of about one percentage
point.
   The satellite data were presented similarly, with a decline of
2.5 percent before corrections for solar and other fluctuations
estimated for the band between 53 degrees North and 53 degrees
South (about Punta Arenas, Chile). This band covers all of the
inhabited Southern Hemisphere.
   The Antarctic hole is so pronounced that scientists now think of
it as a year-round phenomenon because of its effects elsewhere. No
one knows whether a similar ``hole'' could develop over the North
Pole.
   Watson said planned high-altitude research flights over the
Arctic next winter will be ``absolutely essential'' in deciding
whether to accelerate or change the cuts called for under the
chlorofluorocarbons treaty.
   Declining to make policy recommendations, Watson said, ``A fully
implemented ... treaty can do absolutely nothing to remove the
ozone hole over Antarctica,'' which scientists earlier had
estimated could last 100 years.

   About 450 gallons of highly flammable
and toxic chemicals found in drums along a busy road probably were
the waste product of an illegal drug laboratory, authorities said
Tuesday.
   The chemicals, which included acetone and ether, were found
Monday in 10 drums about 4 miles west of this northern California
town, according to Greg Smith, coordinator of emergency services
and assistant fire chief for Mendocino County.
   The chemicals, along with another 400 gallons found on two other
occasions in the past two months, probably came from a laboratory
making methamphetamine, commonly known as speed, in the area, he
said.
   ``The problem with these people is they don't take any
consideration of waterways or school children waiting nearby,''
said Smith. He noted there was a creek 50 feet from the drums and a
school bus stop 150 yards away.
   There were no injuries, but Smith said there was concern about
the chemicals because the drums had small leaks and some of the
chemicals were crystalizing and foaming.

   Mayor John Fedo has been charged with
swindling, falsifying entries in his city expense records and lying
to the state auditor about how city money was spent, but he says
it's a case of dirty politics.
   The indictment ``is not going to have an effect on City Hall,''
Fedo said at a news conference Monday, insisting that the charges
are an elaborate ploy by his political enemies.
   The indictment, including 22 felonies, was returned Thursday by
a St. Louis County grand jury and was made public after Fedo, in
office nearly nine years, was arraigned Monday.
   The indictment includes one count of theft, one count of failure
to pay over state funds, six counts of presenting false claims to a
public officer or body, 13 counts of permitting false claims
against the government, one count of obstructing the state auditor
and one count of misconduct of a public employee.
   If convicted, Fedo, 37, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison on the theft charge and up to five years in prison on most
of the other charges. He was freed on his own recognizance. A
hearing is scheduled for May 3.
   Fedo's lawyer, Douglas Sauter, said he will move for dismissal
of the charges. Fedo was ``tried once in the election and found not
guilty,'' he said.
   Fedo, a member of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, won
his first four-year term as mayor in 1979 and has been re-elected
twice.
   The theft charge concerns $13,500 given to Fedo by three
businessmen to lobby for state funds for a convention center in the
city.
   During the 1987 election campaign, Fedo said he passed the funds
to an unnamed Twin Cities businessman in 1985 in exchange for
information about other cities' convention center proposals.
   Duluth, a city of 85,000 on the western tip of Lake Superior,
was never in competition for a $200 million convention center for
which Bloomington and Minneapolis vied, according to the charges.
The Legislature awarded Duluth a total of $17.2 million for its
relatively small center.
   Prosecutors say the mayor played a limited role in lobbying for
the convention center which he later claimed to have won almost
single-handedly.

   The Soviet Union said Tuesday negotations on
banning chemical weapons are stagnating, and blamed the United
States and Britain.
   Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet delegate to the 40-nation Conference
on Disarmament, said some Western delegations ``unfortunately make
an ever greater emphasis on the idea that allegedly there is no
need to hurry, that there is a lot more work to be done.'' His
reference was to recent statements by U.S. and British delegates.
   Tessa Solesby of Britain responded by telling the conference:
``We have to cope with a formidable number of technical
difficulties. This is why I am uneasy and my authorities are uneasy
when we are told a solution lies just around the corner.''
   U.S. envoy Max Friedersdorf agreed and urged the Soviet Union to
provide more information on the size of its chemical weapons
arsenal.
   The disarmament conference began negotiations in 1968 on a
convention to bar production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms.
   Nazarkin, in a declaration he said was aimed at helping the
exchange of information, claimed the Soviets have not transferred
chemical arms equipment or technology to other states.
   ``The Soviet delegation is concerned about a slowdown, even
stagnation'' of negotiations, but a draft convention could be
finished this year if there is a drastic change of pace, he told
reporters later.
   Nazarkin spoke of three main obstacles to an agreement: The
order of destruction of weapons over a 10-year period, inspection
provisions for commercial chemical plants, and mandatory inspection
of weapons sites on short notice if a violation is suspected.
   Nazarkin repeated the Soviet claim that Washington is blocking
progress by seeking exemptions for private industry.

<TEXT>
   The wife and son of disgraced evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart pleaded with television viewers Tuesday to send huge
donations to keep the $140 million-a-year Jimmy Swaggart Ministries
afloat.
   ``The Holy Spirit is telling you right now to send a large gift
of help to carry my word, my program and my message around the
world,'' Frances Swaggart said on the ministry's weeklong telethon.
   ``Don't walk, run to that phone'' to make a pledge, Donnie
Swaggart urged.
   Tuesday's pleas were made in the third day of a scheduled
weeklong telethon aimed at raising money for the ministry.
Tuesday's show also coincided with Swaggart's 54th birthday.
   Donnie Swaggart, often sobbing, wished his father happy birthday
and pledged ``I'll never leave or forsake you.''
   Donnie and his mother said that unless the telethon raises
enough money, some of the ministry's work in foreign countries will
have to shut down. In earlier broadcasts they said that even the
ministry's regular daily television show may have to stop.
   Swaggart said in a JSM publication that the ministries were
about $14.7 million in deficit through February. The announcement
is made in the March 1988 edition of ``The Evangelist,'' a magazine
published by the ministry.
   In an article outlining the telethon, Swaggart claimed expenses
average $13 million a month. The article did not detail how the
money is spent or explain how the deficit was created.
   Swaggart has not participated in the telethon.
   He voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit at the 7,500-seat
Family Worship Center and his worldwide television ministry shortly
after news reports of his alleged involvement with a prostitute.
National leaders of the Assemblies of God denomination will decide
later this month whether to discipline him for committing sexual
misconduct.
   Swaggart has publicly confessed to his family, church and
television congregation that he had committed a sin but has not
publicly revealed what sin he committed.
   Published reports, however, have alleged that Swaggart was
photographed leaving a seedy New Orleans-area motel room with a
prostitute. It also is reported that Swaggart paid prostitutes to
perform lewd acts while he watched.
   Since Swaggart stepped down, the ministry has stopped work on
one of its construction projects, laid off some 100 employees and
canceled at least two ministry crusades.
   Mrs. Swaggart and her son said record donations are crucial to
keep the ministry alive.
   ``God is going to touch you to give the largest gift you have
ever given,'' Mrs. Swaggart said. ``The last few weeks Satan has
pressed his hand down strong to destroy'' the ministries.
   Family Worship Center co-pastor Jim Rentz said news reports
about Swaggart are ``not the truth. They are being sidetracked.''
He did not elaborate.
   In the magazine article, Swaggart complained ``the news media is
opposed to us. Most of the world's religions are opposed to us.
Sometimes I think every single denomination in America is opposed
to us.''

<HEAD>Hearing For Pastor, Elders Of Community Chapel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday made formal an order
reinstating a pastor accused by church elders of adultery stemming
from his exhortations to build ``spiritual connections'' through
dancing with other members' spouses.
   Donald Lee Barnett has admitted he sinned, but says he repented
and wants to remain as pastor of Community Chapel and Bible
Training Center, based in Burien, south of Seattle.
   The dispute spilled into court last week, and King County
Superior Court Judge Jim Bates on Tuesday signed an order he issued
verbally on Friday, which reinstated Barnett.
   A week earlier, church elders ``disfellowshipped'' Barnett,
accusing him of sexual misconduct with several women in the
congregation and saying he would not follow restrictions against
being alone with any female parishioner other than his wife.
   Church elders filed a new motion Tuesday for a more detailed
restraining order, which would prevent both sides from: firing
church employees; interfering with worship services scheduled by
either side; authorizing expenditures except through the
established system; giving keys to buildings, offices r files to
unauthorized people; destroying church documents; and hiring new
employees except through the established system. Bates set a
hearing Thursday.
   Barnett, 57, founded the 1,500-member church in 1967. He has an
unpublished telephone number, and could not be reached for comment.
   Competing services were held Sunday, and an affidavit by elder
Scott Hartley said that while Barnett attracted 240 and 195 people
to two services, the elders' services attracted 600 and 660 people.
   Church spokesman Chuck Kerr said a note from Barnett was posted
at the school chapel, reading: ``Anyone who walks in this building
will be `disfellowshipped' and staff will be fired.'' When Barnett
heard how many attended the elders' service, he rescinded the
order, according to Kerr.
   A former Boeing draftsman, Barnett guided the church from a
Bible study group to an organization that once had members in this
country, western Canada, and several other countries. Membership
locally was once about 2,500.
   Dissident members have said many problems resulted from
Barnett's preaching of ``spiritual connection,'' a relationship
between church members of opposite sexes with partners other than
their spouses. The members are encouraged to dance with regular
partners, or ``connections.''
   Some former members have said relationships that developed
between these partners have led to suicide and broken marriages.
More than a half-dozen former members have sued, some alleging
Barnett sexually assaulted them under the pretense of ministerial
counseling.
   On March 20, 1986, a woman drowned her 5-year-old daughter in a
bathtub, believing it would save the child from demons. Court
records said the woman was tormented by her 18 years of involvement
in the church. She was sent to an institution.

   Jeb Stuart Magruder, who became a
Presbyterian minister after serving a prison term for his role in
the Watergate scandal, was named Tuesday to head a mayoral
commission on values and ethics.
   ``A lot of my time outside has been talking about these
issues,'' Magruder said. ``I talk about these issues to the
Kiwanises and the Rotaries around here, as well as deal with these
issues through the church, so I would hope that my background would
be helpful.''
   Mayor Dana Rinehart said the 15-member commission, on which he
also will sit, will attempt to stimulate conversations on ethics.
   A city-wide ethics debate was prompted last year after bags of
money fell from an armored truck on a downtown freeway. Police said
many of those who stopped to scoop up the cash never returned it to
authorities.
   Magruder held several White House positions from 1969 to 1973,
including deputy director of communications at the time of the 1972
Watergate break-in.
   He spent seven months in prison after pleading guilty to perjury
and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   After his release from prison in 1976, he entered a seminary and
was ordained in 1981.
   Since 1984, Magruder has been executive minister at First
Community Church in suburban Marble Cliff.
   He will receive no pay for serving on the commission.

<HEAD>Nation's Urban Schools Failing, Study Says</HEAD>

   A national summit meeting of educators,
business leaders and politicians should be convened to combat low
morale and high dropout rates in urban schools, the president of
the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said
Thursday.
   ``I see it as a kind of Manhattan Project for urban schools,''
said Ernest Boyer, referring to the task force of scientists who
developed the atomic bomb during World War II.
   Boyer, speaking at a news conference to release a foundation's
report on the nation's big-city schools, said schools must be
extricated from ``a web of mindless authority and contradictory
responsibilities.''
   ``I wonder if we don't need a national forum ... of top
educators, politicians, corporate leaders, as voices most heard and
listened to,'' said Boyer, a former U.S. commissioner of education.
   The report, the first issued by the foundation trustees, said
urban schols were riddled with problems ranging from low morale and
high dropout rates to dilapidated facilities and crippling
bureaucratic regulations.
   ``The nation was challenged (by President Kennedy) to reach for
the moon within a decade and we did. And I think it's not
impossible for us to dream to have inner-city schools of excellence
by the year 2000,'' Boyer said.
   In the 38-page report called, ``An Imperiled Generation: Saving
Urban Schools,'' the Carnegie trustees said: ``Many people have
simply written off city schools as little more than human
storehouses to keep young people off th streets.''
   Stanley O. Ikenberry, foundation chairman and president of the
Univeristy of Illinois, warned: `` If people in our cities don't
believe that our students can succeed and that our schools can
succeed, they won't support them and the problem will continue.''
   The foundation called for a ``crusade on behalf of urban
education'' including greater financial support for inner-city
schools and more freedom and accountability for teachers and
principals.
   Principals and teachers ``should be given more authority to run
the schools,'' but if urban schools do not shape up, ``there must
be outside intervention,'' the report said.
   ``It is our deep conviction that when schools fail, swift
changes must be made. No other crisis _ a flood, a health epidemic,
a garbage strike or even snow removal _ would be as calmly accepted
without full-scale emergency intervention,'' the report said.
   The trustees suggested that an evaluation team of educators,
parents and others be dispatched to a troubled school, where it
could recommend sweeping changes including removing the principal
and, as a last resort, closing the school.
   ``School reform is failing in the inner city because the
diagnosis is wrong,'' Boyer said. ``Formulas for renewal _ more
homework, more testing, more requirements for graduation _ work
best for schools that already are succeeding and for students who
are college bound.
   ``But to require a troubled student in an urban ghetto to take
another unit in math or foreign language, without more guidance and
support, is like raising a hurdle in the high jump without giving
more coaching to someone who has stumbled.''
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett issued a statement
saying: ``I am generally encouraged by this report. It's good to
have major figures from the education establishment strongly
endorse the principle of accountability. Now let's see if agreement
on this idea can be followed by the political courage required to
put it into practice.''
   Support for the foundation's effort also came from the National
Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.
   Carnegie surveyed teachers and visited schools in six cities:
Chicago, Cleveland, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York.
   It proposed fighting the problem on several fronts, including:
   _Setting high expectations for all students. It decried the 28
percent of urban teachers surveyed by Carnegie who thought a 25
percent dropout rate was tolerable.
   _Freeing principals and teachers ``from a system of red tape
that causes them to scrounge for chalk and paper clips while
bombarding them with a steady flow of procedural directives.''
   _A National Urban Schools Program that would feature expanded
federal funds for Head Start, child nutrition, and the Chapter 1
remedial program, as well as loans to refurbish buildings and other
new aid targeted at the nation's 100 biggest cities, from
Worcester, Mass. (population 160,000) to Los Angeles and New York.
   _Expanded partnerships between the schools and colleges and
corporations.

   Opponents of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
shuttered businesses and took to the streets in six Indian states
Tuesday, but the general strike failed to win widespread support.
   Police arrested 7,000 people in the street clashes, which left
seven dead and 200 injured, news reports said.
   Shops and offices were closed and traffic was disrupted in
Bombay, India's business center, and Calcutta, its largest city.
   There were few signs of support, however, for the opposition-led
strike in the other 19 Indian states. It drew little apparent
backing in New Delhi, where most businesses remained open.
   The strike was called by most major opposition parties to
protest sectarian violence, rising prices and alleged corruption in
government. The parties, which include two communist groups, demand
that Parliament be dissolved and new elections held.
   In Parliament, proceedings were disrupted for more than an hour
Tuesday when opposition members raised anti-government slogans in
the upper house. Earlier, the entire opposition boycotted the first
hour of business in both houses in support of the strike.
   Gandhi's Congress Party holds more than 400 of 542 seats in the
popularly elected lower house. The rest are divided among
opposition parties which have been divided despite common demands
that Gandhi resign.
   At least five people were killed in clashes in eastern Bihar
state, according to the United News of India. The news agency also
reported that two people were killed and seven injured when a flour
mill owner opened fire at opposition party supporters attacking his
mill near the coastal city of Ernakulam in southern Kerala state.
   The agency said at least 75 people were hurt in political
violence in West Bengal state.
   State-run television said only two people died in
strike-connected violence.
   At least 1,500 people were arrested in central Madhya Pradesh
state and another 1,000 in eastern Assam state, UNI said.
   It said 14 policemen were injured near the Pakistani border in
Rajasthan state when they were pelted with stones as they tried to
remove roadblacks.

   A woman who paid up to $200,000 to have commandos
snatch her daughter from Jordan fears her ex-husband may try a
similar tactic to get the girl back in the custody dispute, people
familiar with the case said Tuesday.
   The woman hired retired U.S. commandos to help her whisk Lauren
Bayan, 7, off a school bus in Jerash, north of Amman, in late
January, and has kept her whereabouts secret, even from her
husband, since returning to this country, family members confirmed.
   Cathy Phelps Mahone now fears her husband could try a similar
maneuver to get the girl back, said Holly Planells, who heads
American Children Held Hostage, a Brentwood, N.Y. advocacy group
set up to provide help in international child custody cases.
   ``Once you get the child back, it isn't over,'' said Ms.
Planells, who has been seeking the return of her own 4-year-old son
from Jordan in a similar custody battle.
   Ms. Planells said she had been in contact with Ms. Mahone since
she and her daughter returned from the Middle East but did not know
her whereabouts other than somewhere in Texas.
   Ms. Mahone claims her ex-husband, Jordanian-born Mohammed Ali
Bayan, failed to return the child to her mother after visiting last
Halloween. A Dallas judge gave Ms. Mahone custody after her
December 1980 divorce, but Bayan reportedly claims custody under
Jordanian law.
   Ms. Mahone has not divulged her whereabouts even to her current
husband, Lytt, whom she married five years ago.
   ``The main thing is their safety and their being together and
hopefully not having anything else happen,'' Mahone said in an
interview with the Marshall (Texas) News Messenger.
   However, Mahone said he was not in favor of the commando
operation, saying he felt the odds his wife and stepdaughter would
be injured were too great.
   Ms. Mahone has talked about possible movie and book deals about
the raid to bring attention to 2,500 similar cases, Ms. Planells
said.
   An official at the U.S. Embassy in Amman knew the group was in
Jordan, but was misled about their intentions, State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said. The embassy officer was recalled to
Washington for questioning, he said.
   Redman also said the United States had expressed regrets over
the officer's possible involvement in the violation of Jordanian
law.
   Jordanian authorities have had no official comment on the case.
But one official, who did not want his name used, said a Jordanian
citizen was involved in getting the girl out of the country.
   The man, an employee of an agency that does security work for
the U.S. Embassy, was held for questioning, the official said.
   The operation was planned and executed Jan. 28 by Corporate
Training Unlimited, a Fayetteville, N.C., company that specializes
in ``hostage rescue training,'' the Philadelphia Inquirer reported
Saturday, quoting anonymous sources close to the participants.
   Company president Donald Feeney denied involvement.
   Ms. Planells said the operation cost $200,000, but Ms. Mahone's
brother, David Phelps of Niceville, Fla., said he had been told the
mercenaries were paid $100,000.
   Another brother, Danny Phelps of Woodbridge, N.J., confirmed
reports of the rescue were generally correct.
   The Phelpses and their sister helped pay some of the costs of
the mission, the Northwest Florida Daily News of Fort Walton Beach
reported.

   An 11-year-old boy who shot and killed two
men who broke into his home and tried to steal a VCR had never been
left home alone before the fatal day, his mother said Tuesday.
   Todd Knight shot the two men with his .22-caliber rifle Monday
afternoon when they broke into his family's rural home and tried to
steal a videocassette recorder, authorities said.
   Ann Knight said her son did not think he had even wounded the
men and was very upset when he learned they were dead.
   ``I think he went to pieces after it was all over,'' she said.
   ``He has never been here by himself _ not even for a minute,''
Mrs. Knight said. She said the boy still was shaken and the family
stayed home Tuesday to be with him.
   The boy will not be charged, officials said.
   ``I feel sure he felt very much as having his life in danger and
I certainly look at it as being justifiable,'' said Spartanburg
County Sheriff's Capt. John Blackwood.
   ``His life was in danger, he looked for an escape and could not
find one .... He was a very brave young man,'' said county Coroner
Jim Burnett.
   He ``acted very wisely,'' Burnett said.
   Todd, a fifth-grade student at Woodruff Elementary School, was
left alone in the house when his sister, Tammy, left to practice
for a weekend beauty pageant, Mrs. Knight said.
   Todd would normally have gotten off his school bus at Mrs.
Knight's parents' home nearby until the rest of the family came
home, but her parents were not home Monday afternoon.
   Mrs. Knight works at a Greenville insurance agency and said she
left work early to minimize the time Todd would be home alone.
   The boy told authorities that he was watching television when he
heard noises at the front door. He said he got the .22-caliber
rifle his father gave him for Christmas and loaded four rounds.
   A man he described as ``rough'' was pounding on the door, but
the man drove away and Todd went back to watching cartoons, keeping
his gun nearby.
   About 10 minutes later he heard banging at a dining room window.
He saw two men this time; unaware of his presence, they climbed
through the window.
   The boy went into a bathroom to climb out the window but saw the
men's car parked outside.
   He went back to the hallway, peeked around the corner into the
den and was spotted by one of the intruders as they were taking the
VCR off the television set.
   Todd fired three shots at the men, who dropped the VCR and fled
through a door into the garage.
   Todd immediately called 911 for help.
   Police found one of the men face down in the back yard, about 50
to 75 feet from the house, while the second man was in the driver's
seat of their car, Burnett said.
   Mrs. Knight said she and her husband, William, were thankful
their son was unharmed but they spent most of the night awake.
   ``There wasn't much sleeping here last night,'' Mrs. Knight
said. ``There are so many `what ifs.'''
   Dead at the scene were Danny Ray Abernathy, 35, and Broadus
Petty, 39, both of Spartanburg. Police were searching for a third
person they suspect might have been involved.

<TEXT>
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban on
Tuesday disputed reports that riot police clubbed students last
week to break up marches commemorating the anniversary of campus
protests 20 years ago.
   He said no general orders were issued for police to use force to
stop the March 8 student demonstrations in Warsaw and Krakow. If
force was used, it was applied only sporadically when
demonstrations turned violent, he added.
   ``I deny Western reports that police used clubs to disperse
demonstrations,'' said Urban at his weekly news conference.
``Police did not have any orders to use force without necessity,
without some aggression from the side of illegal demonstrators.''
   The demonstrations for more academic freedom coincided with the
anniversary of March 1968 student protests against censorship and
political repression that were violently broken up by police and
pro-government workers.
   The outlawed Solidarity union condemned the authorities'
reaction to the March 8 demonstrations. It issued a statement
saying that several people were hospitalized after they were beaten
by police.
   The labor group, in a statement drawn up at a meeting Sunday of
its National Executive Commission, said the police action reflected
``a growth of repressive tendencies'' on the part of communist
authorities.
   Lech Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, heads the
committee.
   ``So the situation of 20 years ago has been repeated, which
finally puts the lie to the authorities' statements about a change
of judgment of the disgraceful events of '68,'' said the statement,
which was read over the telephone Tuesday by Solidarity's national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   At Urban's news conference, Western reporters said they had seen
riot police charging demonstrators and hitting them with clubs to
disperse a march by several hundred students after a Mass at
Warsaw's St. Anne's Church.
   Urban replied, ``You have an undoubted advantage over me ... but
it's the task of police to prevent an illegal demonstration.''
   The students were demanding restoration of academic freedoms won
during the 1980-81 Solidarity labor upheaval and legalization of
the Independent Students Union, which was outlawed under martial
law in 1982.
   The government said police detained 83 people taking part in the
student protests in Warsaw and Krakow.
   Solidarity was chartered by the government during nationwide
strikes in the fall of 1980. It was suspended in December 1981 and
subsequently outlawed by Parliament.

   A couple searching for aluminum cans
stumbled on a set of bleached bones in the desert northeast of El
Paso where five young women have been found in shallow graves since
September, police said Tuesday.
   Police were painstakinly removing the remains Tuesday and did
not know the victim's age or sex or how long ago the person had
been buried.
   The bones were found a few hundred yards southeast of where the
remains of five young women were discovered last fall, said Police
Chief John Scagno.
   The women's deaths could be the work of a serial killer, said
police, who have resumed searching for additional bodies.
   ``The body has not been removed,'' Scagno said Tuesday morning.
``We're doing it inch by inch, like we've done in the past. We hope
to have it out by this evening.''
   The couple found exposed bones Monday afternoon and told police,
Scagno said. Scagno would not say whether clothing or a weapon were
found.
   ``The only detail we're going to tell you is ... the body had
braces (on the teeth),'' Scagno said. ``The body itself is just
skeletal remains.''
   The bodies of Maria Rosa Casio, 24, and Karen Baker, 20, were
found buried close together Sept. 4. The bodies of Desiree
Wheatley, 15, and Dawn Smith, 14, were found Oct. 20, about 200
yards away. On Nov. 3, the body of Angelica Frausto, 17, was found
between the first two pairs of graves. All were El Paso residents
except Ms. Casio, who was from the Dallas suburb of Addison.
   No one has been arrested, but a detective testified in January
that David Leonard Wood of El Paso is one of several suspects.
Wood's trial on an unrelated sexual assault charge began Monday. He
is accused of an assault last summer near where the bodies were
found.
   After two bodies were found, police used dogs and airborne
infrared cameras to find the other bodies. Deputy Chief Gus Massey
and Scagno said they were not surprised that their search did not
turn up the sixth body.
   ``The dogs, of course, have difficulty, given a certain period
of time a body has been out there,'' Scagno said. ``The longer the
period of time, the more difficult it is to locate.''
   Massey said strong winds may have uncovered the bones.
   The FBI and Border Patrol are assisting in the investigation,
and a U.S. Customs airplane circled the area Tuesday. Customs
officials on Tuesday ordered a plane carrying an El Paso
Herald-Post photographer to stop taking pictures and leave.
   Scagno said residents of northeast El Paso should be ``concerned
and careful as always.''
   ``Do we think at this moment that there is any need for any type
of panic? The answer is no,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An instructor's failure to keep his plane out
of restricted airspace on a student training flight was the primary
cause of a 1987 collision that killed 10 people in Utah, a federal
panel concluded Tuesday.
   The single-engine training plane and a SkyWest commuter plane
collided near Kearns, Utah, on Jan. 15, 1987, while making an
approach to Salt Lake City International Airport after a flight
from Pocatello, Idaho.
   The National Transportation Safety Board absolved the air
traffic controller handling the SkyWest plane. The other aircraft
was flying under visual flight rules and was not under the
direction of air traffic control.
   Nevertheless, the NTSB said the accident might have been avoided
if the private aircraft had equipment that would have provided the
controller information on the plane's altitude. Investigators said
the single-engine Mooney M-20C was on the radar screen, but without
altitude information the controller would not have known the two
planes were about to collide.
   The controller, in any case, insisted to investigators that he
never saw the Mooney on his screen.
   With a ``Mode-C'' transponder the controller's screen would have
shown a larger ``data bloc,'' including altitude information that
might have caused the controller to notice the plane more easily,
the report said. The plane did not require such equipment, however.
   The safety board put the primary blame for the accident on the
instructor of the private aircraft's ``lack of navigational
vigilance ... which led to the unauthorized intrusion'' into the
restricted airspace that surrounds the Salt Lake City airport.
   A plane may not enter the airspace without permission from an
air traffic controller. No contact was ever made between the Mooney
aircraft and the control tower, investigators said.
   The Mooney had been making ``touch-and-go'' takeoffs and
landings at Salt Lake Airport No. 2 near the main airport and
apparently strayed into the airspace being used by commercial
aircraft, investigators said.
   The safety board cited as another contributing factor ``the
limitations of the air traffic control system to provide collision
protection under the circumstances of this accident'' although it
did not blame the controller specifically.
   The Mooney's pilot was Chester Baker of Sandy, Utah, and the
flight instructor was Paul Lietz of Salt Lake County, Utah.
   The crew of SkyWest Flight 1834 was: Capt. Michael D. Gambill of
Helena, Mont., and First Officer Walter F. Ray Jr. of Chubbuck,
Idaho.
   While the NTSB staff recommended in a draft report that blame be
limited to the pilots of the Mooney, one board member, John Lauber,
pushed for at least some blame being directed at the air traffic
control system as well.
   Lauber, while saying he wasn't blaming the controller, said he
had ``fundamental concerns'' about the Federal Aviation
Administration policy that generally limits a controller's
responsibilities to those aircraft that are flying under instrument
flight rules under direct air traffic control.
   Lauber and several other board members suggested that the two
SkyWest pilots might have been preoccupied with trying to find a
Western Airlines Boeing 737 that also was in the area. Shortly
before the accident, air traffic control advised the crew about the
Boeing 737, but radio transmissions showed the pilots were having
trouble finding the plane, which was several miles away.

   The U.S. Embassy in Panama has rejected an
attempt by Panama's two-week-old government to order an American
embassy officer out of the country, the State Department said
Tuesday.
   The Panamanian government on Monday asked Terrence Kneebone,
director of the U.S. Information Service, to leave the country
within 48 hours. No explanation was given.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the U.S. Embassy
rejected the Panamanian note because it was delivered by
representatives of a regime not recognized by the United States as
the legitimate authority in Panama.
   There was no immediate indication what Panama's next step would
be.
   In late February, President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted and
replaced by the education minister, Manuel Solis Palma. The United
States continues to recognize Delvalle as Panama's president.

   Queen Elizabeth II and her 11 relatives received
an average 4.6 percent pay raise in Tuesday's annual government
budget. Prince Andrew will get the biggest increase _ 73 percent.
   In all, the Civil List section of the budget allocated
$10,241,000 to the royal family. Queen Elizabeth received $8.3
million.
   The Civil List, announced in Parliament by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, gave the queen and nine other members of
the royal family 4 percent raises.
   But 28-year-old Prince Andrew's pay went from $92,500 to
$159,100. The share of Prince Edward, 24, who has been receiving
$37,000, remained unchanged.
   The government said Andrew's allowance, which more than doubled
after he married Sarah Ferguson in July 1986 and became the Duke of
York, was insufficent to meet his royal expenses.
   Before marrying his allowance had stood unchanged since 1972.
   Andrew also earns $32,400 a year as a Royal Air Force instructor
in helicopter warfare.
   His new allowance pushed up the royal family's appropriation up
4.6 percent from $9,785,600 last year. The current inflation rate
is 3.3 percent.
   Money Magazine last month listed the 61-year-old queen as
Britain's richest person, estimating her personal fortune at $5.87
billion.
   Queen Mother Elizabeth, 87, received the second-largest sum of
$722,050 in the budget. Queen Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip,
received $402,750.
   The Civil List does not include such items as running the royal
yacht Britannia or royal aircraft, or money for Prince Charles, the
39-year-old heir who gave up his share to live on income from land
and investments.
   Royal family members officiate at public ceremonies and
represent Britain abroad in many trips each year. Published reports
have estimated that the country spends at least six times the Civil
List sum on the monarchy.
   Staff costs account for up to 75 percent of the Civil List,
Buckingham Palace said. Salaries in the royal households correspond
whenever possible to their equivalents in the civil service, a
spokesman said.

   Twenty-three protesters in wheelchairs and a
blind person were arrested Tuesday after blocking buses during
morning rush hour at the Department of Transportation, police said.
   The demonstrators, members of Americans Disabled for Accessible
Public Transit, were protesting the appeal by the Transportation
Department of a judge's ruling that all public transit authorities
provide services for the handicapped regardless of cost.
   The protesters had chained themselves to the entrances of the
transportation building Monday afternoon and stayed there through
the night as temperatures dipped below freezing. In the morning,
they wheeled themselves into the traffic, District of Columbia
Police Officer Walter Ferguson said.
   ``We kept warm with the thought we were sending the Department
of Transportation a message that we will take any action necessary
to obtain our civil rights,'' protester Stephanie Thomas told
hearing commissioner John Treanor after her arrest.
   Treanor released the protesters on $10 bond each, saying they
could forfeit the bond in lieu of a fine.
   The demonstrators were charged with obstructing traffic at about
9 a.m., police said.
   ``It is unfortunate disabled people have to take these actions.
But we'll continue to do so until the federal government
acknowledges our right to use public transit,'' said Clayton Jones,
a protester from Hartford, Conn.
   The Department of Transportation is appealing the Jan. 4
decision by U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz in Philadelphia which
struck down the department's regulation that transit agencies spend
3 percent of their budgets on the disabled.
   Katz called the 3 percent an ``arbitrary and capricious'' figure
that was so low it denied the handicapped ``the minimum quality of
service mandated by the Congress.''
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley spoke briefly with the
demonstrators Monday and offered to meet them again next week, said
Hal Paris, spokesman for the department.
   ``We haven't heard anything from them,'' Burnley said Tuesday.
   He confirmed that the department was appealing Katz' decision
but would not elaborate while the case is pending.

<TEXT>
   Wilson Ferreira Aldunate, head of the
National Party, the largest opposition party in Uruguay, died
Tuesday of cancer, his family said. He was 69.
   The government declared 24 hours of national mourning.
   His wife, Susana Sienra, sons Gonzalo and Juan Raul and daughter
Silvia were at his side when he died. Hundreds of mourners gathered
outside his home in the seaside suburb of Pocitos to pay respects
to the political leader, who had been ill since July.
   Ferreira Aldunate ran for president in 1971 and narrowly lost to
Juan Bordaberry of the Colorado Party.
   He went into exile in 1973 and lived abroad for 11 years after
the military seized power.
   An outspoken critic of the right-wing military regime, he was
imprisoned upon his return to Uruguay in 1984. The military
government refused to let him run for president in 1985, but
released him five days after the elections.
   Ferreira Aldunate, son of a rancher and rural doctor, studied
for the law, but then went into politics. He was a member of
Congress for 34 years and was agriculture minister from 1963-67.
   He consolidated control over the centrist National Party in the
1960s while in the Senate.
   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina mourned the death of his
friend Ferreira Aldunate as the loss of ``a notable figure in
Uruguayan democracy and in Latin America.''
   A Mass is planned Tuesday in the metropolitan cathedral. Burial
will be Wednesday in Montevideo.

<HEAD>Judicial Panel Says House Should Consider Impeachment of Judge
Nixon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of judges that makes policy for the
federal courts urged the House on Tuesday to consider impeaching
U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is
scheduled to go to prison for perjury on March 23.
   The group, the Judicial Conference of the United States,
unanimously supported a resolution that says ``consideration of
impeachment may be warranted.''
   Nixon, 59, sentenced to five years in prison following his 1986
perjury conviction, has remained a judge but has not been hearing
cases since he was indicted in 1985. He continues to be paid his
annual salary of $89,500.
   Nixon would forfeit his salary and his eligibility for a pension
at age 65 if he is impeached by the House and removed from office
by the Senate.
   The recommendation that the House consider impeaching him was
approved by a vote of 24-0 by the judges' group. Three members
abstained, including Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who
traditionally does not vote on such matters.
   Nixon has been a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge for
Mississippi's southern district since 1982.
   His legal problems stemmed from his business relationship with
Wiley Fairchild, a wealthy investor who sold three oil well
properties to Nixon in 1980 at bargain prices.
   Nixon, who netted more than $50,000 from the deal, testified he
bought the oil and gas rights in three wells for $9,500 in a
legitimate transaction and promised no favor to Fairchild in return.
   He was acquitted of bribery by a federal jury, but was convicted
of lying to a grand jury when he denied discussing drug charges
against Fairchild's son with the elder Fairchild and with a
Mississippi prosecutor.
   The Supreme Court on Jan. 19 denied Nixon's appeal, clearing the
way for his imprisonment.
   Nixon is the third federal judge ever to be indicted for crimes
allegedly committed while in office.
   U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida was acquitted of
bribery in 1983 and impeachment proceedings against him are pending
in the House.
   Former federal judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was convicted in
1984 of failing to report $106,000 on his federal income tax
returns and was sentenced to two years in prison. He was impeached
and removed from office in 1986.

<HEAD>Processors May Substitute Water For Fat, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Processors who make hotdogs, bologna and other
cooked sausages soon will be allowed to make leaner products by
substituting water for fat, so long as there is no loss of
nutritional value, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The leaner products can be labeled as ``lite,'' ``light,'' or
``lower fat'' if they contain at least a fourth less fat than
similar cooked sausage products on the market, officials said. The
labels must include a comparison that explains the term.
   For example, the label for lower-fat hotdogs might say: ``This
product contains 20 percent fat, while USDA allows 30 percent fat
in meat hotdogs.''
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the change in regulations will
be effective on April 14 and ``reflects our desire to facilitate
the marketing of lower-fat products.''
   Current federal rules for cooked sausages limit fat to 30
percent and ``added'' water to 10 percent. The new rule will limit
the combination of fat and added water to 40 percent of the product.
   The maximum fat content in the finished product will continue to
be limited to 30 percent, but the water restriction will be removed
so that processors can substitute some of the water for fat _ and
wind up with a lower-fat product, Crawford said.
   Protein content, which is indirectly controlled by the limits on
fat and added water, will remain unchanged and will be comparable
to other cooked sausages, he said.
   The rule change is being made at the request of the American
Meat Institute, a private trade association, which asked USDA to
develop a standard for light frankfurters and similar cooked
sausages. The proposed change was announced by the agency on Nov.
25, 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill To Expand Legal Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 88-4 on Tuesday for
legislation that would expand legal immigration to the United
States and open the gates wider for western Europeans who once
dominated the flow of foreigners to this country.
   The bill went to the House, where its future is uncertain. Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. has introduced a similar bill to the
Senate measure. He said there may be attempts to link the bill with
proposals to extend an amnesty program for some of those who came
here illegally.
   The Senate rolled up its overwhelming majority because the two
leading immigration authorities in the chamber, Democrat Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming,
teamed up as bipartisan sponsors.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona was the only Democrat to oppose
the bill. Three Republicans voted against it: Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, Pete Wilson of California and Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
   Simpson and Kennedy took aim at a legal immigration system in
which 90 percent of those granted visas are admitted because they
have close family members living legally in this country. Only 10
percent of the immigration visas are granted to fill the needs of
the labor market.
   This system has resulted in 85 percent of U.S. immigrants coming
from Asia and Latin America. A new ``independent'' category, based
on labor skills and other factors, would be expected to admit large
numbers of western Europeans.
   The legislation would apply to those who try to obtain legal
residency through normal U.S. government channels. Sixteen months
ago, Congress ended a six-year debate by enacting legislation to
curb massive illegal entries into the United States.
   The 1986 law included the provision granting amnesty to those
who came here illegally, but resided continuously in this country
since before Jan. 1, 1982. The one-year legalization program ends
May 4, and Schumer and others believe it should be extended.
   Kennedy and Simpson agreed not to link an extension to their
bill to avoid a possible filibuster led by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   The Senate legislation would maintain priority for applicants
with close relatives here and significantly expand available visas
for the new independent category.
   The bill also would establish an overall cap on immigration.
   The level for the first three years would be 590,000 annually,
which is 100,000 higher than the current number of visas.
   Under this umbrella, 470,000 visas in each of the first three
years (440,000 thereafter) would be reserved for family
immigration, and 120,000 (150,000 after three years) would be for
the new ``independent'' category.
   Currently, spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens can enter
the country without limitation.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., a refugee from Nazi Germany, said
he was concerned that the limitation could someday close the doors
to many wishing to come here. But Simpson said the cap is more than
adequate to handle today's applicants, and pointed out the cap
could be changed every three years.
   Schumer's bill would address this problem with a cap of 750,000,
including refugees fleeing from persecution. The Senate cap does
not include refugees, who now are admitted under a separte law that
sets annual limits. The current refugee cap is 68,500.
   The Senate bill also would:
   _Revise family preferences to give higher priority to the
closest family members of citizens and permanent residents.
   _Require the administration to report every year on the effects
of immigration, and to recommend changes in the level of
immigration every three years.
   _Create the independent visas by combining: existing preferences
for professionals, persons of exceptional merit, and those with
needed skills; and establish a new 55,000-visa category based on a
point system.
   Points would be awarded for education, work experience, English
language skills and age.
   _Establish a conditional visa for those who will invest at least
$2 million in this country and employ at least 10 Americans or
legal residents. Up to 4,800 conditional visas would be available
annually, requiring the investor to return to immigration
authorities in two years for adjustment to permanent resident alien
status.
   The applicant would face deportation unless he or she continued
to meet the job-creation requirement.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with later Gorbachev comments, other
details</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured a
factory Tuesday that exports industrial robots to the Soviets and
Americans and told the workers the Soviet Union is too big to give
up all central control.
   The Yugoslav factory operates under the government's
local-management system.
   The reform-minded Soviet leader is on a five-day visit to
Yugoslavia, getting his first look at this independent Communist
country's freer economy.
   Soviet officials said Gorbachev was ``very satisfied'' with his
first two days of talks with Yugoslav leaders and seeks ways of
developing closer relations with the country Moscow once denounced
for ``revisionist'' policies.
   President Tito broke with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1948,
defying the Kremlin's authority in the communist world, and
developed ties to the West. Years of plots and threats from Moscow
followed.
   Relations were mended in the 1950s, with Nikita S. Khrushchev in
charge at the Kremlin, but the last visit to Yugoslavia by a Soviet
leader was in 1980, when Leonid I. Brezhnev attended Tito's funeral.
   During a brief photo session Tuesday, Gorbachev told reporters:
``We got off to a good start.''
   The two sides exchanged copies of a new declaration
acknowledging Yugoslavia's independence from Soviet control, which
replaces similar statements issued in 1955 and 1956. A Yugoslav
spokesman said the document would not be made public until the end
of Gorbachev's visit Friday.
   Fyodor Burlatsky, a Soviet columnist traveling with Gorbachev,
said the Kremlin is preparing to adopt some practices similar to
those in Yugoslavia, among them allowing the open sale of
international newspapers and magazines.
   ``Everybody can hear many voices'' in Yugoslavia, Burlatsky said
in an interview. ``I believe there will be new decisions taken in a
short time'' to let Soviet newstands sell non-Soviet publications.
   He also praised progress Yugoslavia has made ``from bureaucracy
to self-managing socialism.''
   Public interest remained high in the visit by Gorbachev and his
wife, Raisa.
   Crowds gathered to watch the motorcade pass. When word spread
Tuesday evening that the Soviet leader would stop in a downtown
square, several thousand people turned up, but the stop turned out
not to be on his schedule.
   Earlier in the day, the Gorbachevs visited the Park of Peace to
plant a tree, a customary practice.
   To a group of children attending the ceremony, Gorbachev said
the park contains trees planted by many leaders of the non-aligned
movement, of which Tito was a founder.
   ``You take care of this park,'' he said, and carefully shoveled
every bit of dirt from a small pile set aside for the planting.
   After chatting and joking with the children, the Gorbachevs
lined up with them for photographs. He promised the children they
would receive copies.
   At the Ivo Lola Ribar factory outside Belgrade, the Gorbachevs
were shown modern machine tools and robots used by auto-assembly
plants in both the East and West.
   Gorbachev met with the factory Worker Council, which is
responsible for plant operations.
   His ``perestroika'' program, designed to modernize the Soviet
economy, proposes reducing central planning and giving managers and
workers more control over their own factories, but he told the
workers some central control will remain.
   ``We have to maintain a regulatory role at the center to
safeguard us against mistakes, particularly because the country of
the Soviet Union is so large,'' Gorbachev said.
   He brushed off a reporter's question about what useful knowledge
he might take back to the Soviet Union. Gorbachev said his schedule
was too tight for questions.
   In a dinner toast, Gorbachev said ``Eastern and Western Europe
are gradually becoming less and less suspicious of each other.''
   He criticized what he called unfounded charges in the Western
media that he is trying ``to drive a wedge'' between the United
States and its NATO allies.
   ``I have already stated and will repeat once again: We never
had, nor do we now have any such ideas,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet Union is Yugoslavia's largest trading partner. It
ships raw materials in exchange for manufactured goods that
generally are of higher quality than those made at home.
   In contrast to perennial Soviet shortages of consumer goods,
Yugoslavia's shops and markets brim with domestic and imported
products. Inflation is running at about 170 percent, however, the
unemployment rate is 15 percent and Yugoslavia has a $20 billion
debt to foreign creditors.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Move to Expand Farm Export Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm lawmakers drafting a compromise trade
bill agreed Tuesday to expand by more than $1 billion an export
subsidy program designed to spur worldwide sales of U.S.
agricultural commodities.
   ``With this action, Congress has demonstrated that it will
continue to fight European Economic Community subsidization and
give American farmers a fair chance to compete in world trade,''
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said
in a statement.
   The decision to expand to $2.5 billion the Export Enhancement
Program came at a subcommittee session of the House-Senate
conference committee that is seeking a compromise version of
1,000-page trade bills passed by both houses.
   Under the program, which was first established by the 1985 farm
law, grain exporters are provided with government bonuses in the
form of surplus commodities in return for shipping American farm
goods. Proponents say the bonuses offset the difference between
U.S. prices and lower price tags abroad.
   But the panel put off action on the most controversial issue it
faces, a Senate plan to prod the European Community to drop export
subsidies with the threat of a so-called marketing loan program for
wheat, corn and soybeans.
   Marketing loans represent a form of subsidy that provides
producers with the U.S. price while selling the commodities abroad
at world prices. The government makes up the difference.
   Marketing loans established by the 1985 farm law sent exports of
American cotton and rice skyrocketing while stemming a surge in
honey imports.
   Being weighed by the panel is a so-called ``triggered marketing
loan'' that would be put into effect only if current negotiations
under the 92-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade failed
to produce an agreement on eliminating agricultural export
subsidies by the 1990 wheat marketing year.
   Supporters of the concept said a congressional visit to the GATT
talks in Geneva last week found European negotiators dug in over
the subsidy issue and added that American negotiators want the
``club'' of a triggered marketing loan to hold over the heads of
their counterparts.
   ``If you were talking to some of the people we have to negotiate
with, then you might think we need it, too,'' said Leahy. He said
the attitude of some of the Europeans has become ``arrogant.''
   Critics said however that such a plan would strain the budget.
   ``This is potentially a huge amount of money we're talking about
in agricultural programs,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., whose
export-minded home-district citrus producers have traditionally
been as wary of import curbs as they have of barriers to their
products overseas.
   Gibbons distributed a letter signed by Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter, White
House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel and
James Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   It described the triggered marketing loan as a concept that
could bring about a presidential veto of the trade bill. It was
designed to counter claims that American negotiators in Geneva are
encouraging the proposal.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., whose home district includes
numerous fruit and vegetable producers, described the concept as
one that could boomerang on the lawmakers politically.
   ``I can see us passing a $600 million marketing loan and the
administration saying on the record that they don't want it,''
Panetta said. ``We get attacked on that point and there's no
mention that this was a bargaining chip for the GATT negotiations.
I sense that coming.''
   Wheat Belt lawmakers countered that the proposal would cost the
treasury nothing because it would merely serve as ammunition to
hasten agreement on subsidy reductions.
   ``We're not asking you to take her home,'' said Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan. ``We're just asking you to dance with her. Then
when it's closing time, you can go out the back door.''

   Snow showers fell during the afternoon across much of the
Northeast, especially near the Great Lakes and from western
Illinois across the Ohio Valley and the central and southern
Appalachians to the mid Atlantic Coast.
   Four to 6 inches of snow fell in some lakeshore counties of
northeastern Ohio, while 2 to 4 inches fell across southern West
Virginia and around an inch at Boone and West Jefferson, N.C.
   Snow also fell in parts of Michigan, where Marquette got 2
inches of snow during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, bringing
their total snow depth to 43 inches.
   A storm system developing in the West was centered over western
Utah, spreading snow across sections of Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and
Nevada.
   Up to 3 inches of snow was reported at Hill Air Force Base in
northern Utah during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, while 3 to 6
inches fell in the mountains of northern Utah.
   A winter storm watch was posted for central and southwestern
Wyoming overnight and into Wednesday.
   The storm in Utah also generated high wind in sections of the
Southwest, with gusts to 66 mph at Mammoth Lakes, and gusts to 45
mph in the Owens Valley of California and in sections of the Mojave
Valley near Las Vegas, Nev.
   Unseasonably cold weather also moved into the Pacific Northwest
during the morning, dropping temperatures near the freezing mark in
the Seattle and Portland areas.
   Astoria, Ore., tied its record low of 28 and Olympia, Wash.,
dipped to a record 24 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Ellsworth Air Force Base outside Rapid City, S.D., to 75
in the California desert at Blythe, Imperial and Thermal. The early
morning low for the day was 9 degrees below zero at Dickinson, N.D.
   For Wednesday, snow showers were forecast from much of New
England across the northern and central Appalachians to northern
Indiana and Michigan. Snow or snow showers also were forecast in
Utah, and from the northern and central Rockies to much of Kansas.
Showers were forecast in Oklahoma and northern Texas.
   Highs in the 20s or 30s were predicted from New England across
the northern and central Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the upper
Mississippi Valley and the northern and central Plains to the
northern half of the Rockies; in the 60s in Florida and Louisiana,
and in parts of western Oregon; in the 60s or 70s across most of
Texas, southern New Mexico, southern Arizona and much of
California; and in the 40s or 50s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Travel Ban Imposed; Hospital Officials Say 2 Killed, 12 Wounded</HEAD>

   Israel imposed a travel ban Tuesday, one of
several moves a moderate Arab mayor said would increase bitterness
and hatred in the occupied lands. Hospital officials said soldiers
killed two Arabs and wounded 12.
   The military administration also cut telephone lines connecting
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip with foreign countries,
Israel radio reported. It said the measure apparently was to
prevent ``PLO members in Europe from passing orders to residents of
the territories.''
   The military command declined to comment on the reason for the
action, saying only that the army ``is taking different steps to
treat problems in the territories.''
   According to U.N. figures, 96 Palestinians have been killed
since violence began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel occupied
during the 1967 Middle East war, three from the effects of tear gas
and the rest from gunfire or beatings.
   As the ban on travel between the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip took effect, Arabs began a two-day general strike that kept
most of the 110,000 who work in Israel away from their jobs.
   The travel ban is one of several restrictions Israel hopes will
reduce the underground Palestinian leadership's success in running
strikes and forcing the resignations of Arab police and tax
collectors.
   Others include a nightly five-hour curfew on the Gaza Strip's
650,000 residents and selectively cutting off electricity as
punishment.
   ``What is the result? More bitterness, more hatred, more
friction between the two peoples,'' said Elias Freij, a Palestinian
Christian who is mayor of Bethlehem, the West Bank town where
Christ was born.
   ``The Israelis have to realize that after 100 days of uprising,
the Palestinians don't want the occupation,'' Freij said. ``If they
keep rejecting our demands the unrest will go on.''
   Hashem al Shawa, director of the Bank of Palestine in Gaza, said
the latest measures could hamper Gaza's ability to export citrus,
its major earner of hard currency. Half the territory's 52,118 tons
of citrus exports last year went to Jordan over the West Bank
bridges.
   ``The economy is in a very bad situation. Merchants cannot meet
their obligations,'' he said, adding that the bank's depositors
wrote $10 million worth of bad checks last month.
   An official in the army-run territorial administration said the
travel ban was designed to keep agitators and anti-Israeli leaflets
from moving freely between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The latest strike coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
visit to the United States. Underground leaflet No. 10, said the
strike slogan was: ``No alternative to an independent state led by
the PLO, our sole respresentative.''
   A campaign inspired by the Palestine Liberation Organization
caused hundreds of Arab police to resign. Israel radio said Tuesday
that 500 officers had quit, 300 of them in Gaza City, but added
that 40 later returned to work.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said seven Arab officers in Jerusalem
turned in their badges Tuesday, the first resignations in the holy
city.
   Hamza Turkmani, the Israeli-appointed mayor of Gaza City, said
he had threatened to shut down the municipal government and
services if Israeli authorities withheld power or other utilities
from residents.
   He said the Israeli army cut power Monday to the Shati refugee
camp next to Gaza City as punishment for a demonstration.
   ``The Israelis cut the electricity because they want to show
everybody that they need the state of Israel,'' Turkmani declared.
   Army spokesmen said soldiers shot one Palestinian dead in the
West Bank village of Deir Jarir and wounded four in a separate
clashes in Qalqilya.
   Hospital officials said two Arabs were killed and 12 wounded in
street battles that swept the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Among those wounded Tuesday were Rahme Muklad, 50, shot in the
leg, and his sons, Jamal, 20, who was shot in the stomach, and
Rasfat, 22, with a bullet in the back. Both young men were in
serious condition, said officials at Qalqilya hospital.
   The army said Tuesday a military judge sentenced two soldiers
Monday after they were convicted in the brutal beating of
Palestinian detainees photographed by a CBS News crew Feb. 25.
   A spokesman said Ronnen Sasson was sentenced to 21 days in jail
and Arieh Moalem to 10 days, minus four days spent in detention.
Two other soldiers and their commanding officer face more serious
penalties if convicted.
   According to the army, an investigation showed Moalem and Sasson
played a relatively minor part in the beating.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Tuesday he was unable to bridge differences with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir over a U.S. plan for opening Mideast peace
negotiations by May 1.
   But he called the first of three days of talks with Shamir
constructive and said ``we feel encouraged to continue our efforts
to work with Israel and others in the Middle East.''
   Shamir underscored one of the main differences. He said that in
Israel's view, the Middle East peace conference Shultz wants to
convene next month to set the stage for negotiations could not play
``any positive role.''
   President Reagan sought, meanwhile, to reassure Shamir he would
not be put under U.S. pressure to agree to any particular solution
to Israel's 40-year dispute with the Arabs.
   But Reagan stressed that ``making progress toward peace in the
Middle East not only serves mutual interests, it is urgent.''
   In a speech to the United Jewish Appeal, the president said he
would tell Shamir at the White House on Wednesday that ``peace will
not be imposed by us or anyone else.''
   Shultz met with Shamir for about three hours, first over
blueberry pancakes at the secretary's home in suburban Maryland and
then at his State Department office.
   ``We haven't found our way to bridge all of the differences,''
Shultz said afterward. ``I see quite clearly what the nature of the
differences are and what they aren't.''
   Shultz did not offer any details, but Shamir restated his
opposition to an international forum that would include the Soviet
Union and China, which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel
and usually support Arab positions.
   ``We are interested, first of all, to negotiate directly with
all the parties concerned,'' Shamir said. ``We don't see any
positive role for an international conference.''
   The prime minister described his first round with Shultz as
``very serious and thorough.'' He pledged to cooperate ``to get
peace and to enhance the prospects for peace in our area.''
   But, he added, the Arabs were not willing to negotiate with
Israel.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, said the U.S. proposal for
an international conference was ``a sticking point that has to be
resolved if we are going to go ahead.''
   King Hussein of Jordan has demanded the conference. Pazner said
Hussein sees it as ``an instrument which would be used by the
enemies of Israel, both Arabs and non-Arabs, like countries that do
not have diplomatic relations with Israel, to put pressure on
Israel, to try to bring Israel to agree to solutions it would not
agree to in free negotiations.''
   Shamir offered last October to hold Israeli-Jordanian
negotiations in Washington with U.S. and Soviet ``blessing.''
Pazner said Shamir stands by the offer even though it was rejected
by the king.
   The Israeli spokesman said Shamir did not give Shultz ``an
answer'' to the overall proposal for negotiations. ``He did not say
yes, he did not say no,'' he said.
   Speaking a half-mile away, at the Old Executive Office Building
next to the White House, Reagan said he would tell Shamir that
``when it comes to Israel the United States is not a bargainer or a
broker; the United States is a friend and an ally.''
   The president offered assurances to the Jewish gathering that
``we will not leave Israel to stand alone, nor will we acquiesce in
any effort to gang up on Israel.'' He added: ``Peace will not be
imposed by us or by anyone else. It will and must come from the
genuine give-and-take of negotiations. That's what we're working to
set in motion now.''
   In a meeting with a small group of senators at the Capitol,
Shamir was quoted as saying he was not ruling out any issue or
proposal as the subject for negotiations.
   ``The prime minister said there is nothing that is off the table
in terms of negotiations,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Lautenberg said Shamir was asked whether he was ruling out
trading territory for peace with Israel's Arab nations.
   ``I didn't hear anything that said territory is excluded,''
Lautenberg said.
   Lautenberg said he got the impression that Shamir would be
prepared to be ``a lot more flexible'' in direct talks with Arab
states than he is in ``this pre-negotiation period.'' But he added:
``I don't think the prime minister's obstinancy about an
international conference is any less than it was earlier.''
   He said Shamir indicated he might be able to accept ``a
ceremonial group'' of other nations at the opening of discussions.
``But once serious discussions started he wanted to talk only to
Israel's (Arab) neighbors,'' the senator said.
   Shultz set this week as a deadline for a reply from Israel and
Jordan, which would form a delegation with Palestinians for the
negotiations.
   In Amman, a senior Jordanian official told The Associated Press
that Jordan was not yet ready to give a final response to Shultz's
plan.
   ``We are consulting with other Arab leaders,'' said the
official, who demanded anonymity. Asked when he expected the
Jordanian stand to be announced, he said: ``In the next 10 days or
so.''
   On Capitol Hill, Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy
sought to reassure supporters of Israel that an international
conference would not dictate solutions to any side. ``We won't
tolerate efforts _ such as ones by the Soviets or the Syrians _ to
turn this into an authoritative, plenipotentiary forum,'' he told a
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   Murphy said the administration still has questions about the
terms under which the Soviets could participate in such a forum,
and these would be discussed next week when Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze visits Washington for talks with Shultz.
   Pressed by several congressmen why Shultz had softened his
opposition to Soviet participation, Murphy said no Arab state would
enter peace talks without a Soviet presence. ``They're (the
Soviets) in the region, and we have to find a way to deal with
them,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, nine senators made public the text of a letter to
Shultz urging him not to subject Shamir to U .S. criticism or
pressure.
   American support should not be used ``as a lever to force
Israel's leaders to adopt a policy which they see as dangerous to
the national security of their country _ especially when such
policy entails injecting the Soviet Union into the peace process,''
the letter said.
   The letter was signed by Sens. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.; Steven Symms, R-Idaho; David Karnes, R-Neb.; William L.
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H.; Phil Gramm,
R-Texas; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
   Shultz's plan for peace talks anticipates Israel relinquishing
at least part of the West Bank and Gaza Strip it has held since the
1967 Six-Day War in exchange for Arab recognition of the Jewish
state.
   In a tough speech Monday night to another UJA group, Shamir said
yielding territory would invite another attempt by the Arabs to
destroy Israel.
   ``These matters are questions of life and death, of our very
existence,'' he said.
   Also on Shamir's schedule Tuesday were meetings with Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, Republican presidential aspirant Pat
Robertson and congressional leaders.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants IRS Statement To Taxpayers On National Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York congressman proposed on Tuesday a
bill to require the Internal Revenue Service to send taxpayers a
``credit card statement'' highlighting the cost of federal deficit
spending.
   Rep. Joe DioGuardi, R-N.Y., who is a certified public
accountant, would require the IRS to put the national balance sheet
in the format of an individual's regular monthly credit bill. The
statement would be mailed with the government's annual income tax
forms.
   ``And I am sorry to report that the bottom line is that the
average American owes Uncle Sam $18,569.10 from all the unpaid
bills we have allowed to pile up,'' he said. The national debt is
about $2.5 trillion.
   DioGuardi's sample statement for fiscal 1987 includes the
previous balance of $17,118.08. It then details the purchases
ranging from $2,769.34 per taxpayer toward Social Security to
$73.60 for criminal justice.
   It then subtracts payments _ taxes _ and adds in the debt's
finance charge of $1,358,03 per taxpayer.
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for DioGuardi, said the congressman
had not determined how much producing and mailing the annual
statement would add to government spending. But it would be
minimized by including it with the other tax forms, he said.

<HEAD>South Africa Frees 12 Angolan Soldiers In Return For Two Bodies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A South African military plane landed
Tuesday in Luanda and released 12 Angolan soldiers in exchange for
the bodies of two South African corporals killed in northern Angola
in 1985, Angolan officials said.
   They also said U.S. envoy Chester Crocker was expected to arrive
in this Angolan capital by Wednesday for talks with Angolan leaders
following his meetings in Geneva on a southern African peace
settlement with South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of not being identified,
said Tuesday's exchange took place at Luanda Airport. They said 12
Angolan soldiers were freed. The South African military said 12
captured Angolans were freed, but refused to say if they were
soldiers or civilians.
   South Africa identified the two dead soldiers as Cpls. Rowland
Liebenberg and Louis Van Breda, both 25. Angola said they were
killed in Cabinda province May 21, 1985, when Angolan troops
surprised their commando unit outside an oil depot.
   The unit leader, Maj. Wynard Du Toit, was captured. He said the
commandos were sent to blow up the depot belonging to Cabinda Gulf
Oil, a subsidiary of the U.S. oil company Chevron.
   Du Toit was exchanged last September for 133 Angolan soldiers
reportedly captured by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, the South African-backed rebel movement
known as UNITA.
   The Tuesday exchange appeared to be a further step in intense
diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement in Marxist Angola's
13-year conflict. UNITA, which also is supported by the United
States, is fighting to force the Cuban- and Soviet-backed
government to share power.
   The talks Monday between Crocker, assistant secretary of state
for African affairs, and Botha focused on efforts for an agreement
on withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers stationed in
Angola.
   Crocker is trying to negotiate a withdrawal of the Cubans in
return for South African withdrawal from neighboring South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia. South Africa administers Namibia
under a post-World War I mandate from the defunct League of Nations
and has rejected United Nations's resolutions demanding that the
territory be independent.
   South Africa recently acknowledged having troops in southern
Angola, but said they were in the process of withdrawing.
   However, President P.W. Botha of South Africa was quoted in the
Washington Times newspaper Monday as saying South African troops
would not leave Angola unless Cuban troops also left.
   Angola says it will send the Cubans home only when South Africa
pulls its troops out of southern Angola, America halts aid for
UNITA and an independence settlement is reached for Namibia.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola says 9,000 South
African soldiers are in southern Angola.
   UNITA said Tuesday in a statement distributed in Lisbon,
Portugal, that its guerrillas captured the town of Kiwaba-N'zogi in
northern Malange province, killing 12 soldiers and seizing arms.
   It said guerrillas attacked the town 42 miles north of the
provincial capital of Malange on Sunday.
   The rebels said they also captured three Angolan soldiers and
destroyed five trucks in an attack Saturday on a military convoy in
Malange province. They claimed to have killed 10 Angolan soldiers
in an attack on an army post at Elola in southwestern Huila
province, but did not say when.
   UNITA gave rebel casualties in the clashes as three killed and
eight wounded. There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
   In Brussels, Belgian professor Aubin Heyndrickx, a specialist in
toxicology, claimed that Cuban troops were using chemical weapons
in Angola.
   Heyndrickx visited southeast Angola three weeks ago at the
invitation of Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, and examined eight
UNITA soldiers in a field hospital in the Mavinga area.
   He said in stories published Tuesday that examinations showed
the soldiers were victims of toxic gas and further laboratory
checks made later in Ghent confirmed that diagnosis.

   The Senate, trying to avoid another
Iran-Contra affair, voted 71-19 approval Tuesday of a bill
requiring a president to tell Congress about all covert operations
within 48 hours after the action begins.
   The decision came after the Democratic-controlled chamber voted
overwhelmingly to invoke cloture and end an attempt by Republican
conservatives to block final action on the measure.
   The chamber also voted down, 60-32, a move to permit up to 10
days, instead of 48 hours, for notification.
   The House is considering a similar bill, but President Reagan
has threatened to veto the legislation because he argues that it is
an unconstitutional restriction on his authority in the foreign
policy field.
   The bill overhauls procedures for informing Congress about
intelligence activities. The most controversial provision was the
one requiring that Capitol Hill be told about covert operations
within 48 hours after they begin.
   The bill was chiefly written by Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine,
vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and also a member of
the committee which last summer investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Reagan withheld notice from Capitol Hill for 10 months that U.S.
arms were secretly being sold to Iran. Some of the money was
diverted to the anti-Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.
   Current law requires only that the president give ``timely
notice'' to Capitol Hill about covert action, but does not define
the term.
   Cohen and other backers of the legislation have argued that had
Reagan told Congress about the planned sale of weapons to Iran, the
legislators might have complained so loudly that the deal would
have been scuttled.
   Cohen said the 48-hour time period was suggested by intelligence
officials, who said it could be met.
   As it returned to the bill, the Senate voted 73-18 to limit
debate. That was 13 more votes than needed to invoke cloture and
halt the Senate practice of unlimited debate.
   Then, the chamber killed, by a 60-32 margin, an amendment
proposed by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., to extend to up to 10 days
the period during which information about covert actions can be
withheld. Chafee said, ``I think this is a sufficient time'' for
the completion of covert actions such as a hostage rescue, but it
would block anything like the Iran-Contra situation.
   The House Intelligence Committee is considering a similar bill,
but Reagan has already decided to veto any such legislation because
he believes it is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority
to conduct foreign policy, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
last week.
   Carlucci took over as Reagan's national security adviser in the
wake of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., told his colleagues Tuesday that
``this bill is badly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of its
conceptions is that somehow you can legislate intelligence. ...
It's hard for me to believe that one piece of legislation can
obviate stupid activity.''
   If the measure passes, ``we can perhaps prevent another
Iran-Contra,'' said Wallop, but ``we would deny some very wholesome
activity.''
   Wallop claimed that the bill ``would substitute our judgment for
that of the president.''
   But Cohen said, ``nothing could be further from the truth'' and
argued that the Senate ``should not abdicate its constitutional
responsibility.''
   The Senate is a ``co-equal'' to the White House and should
shoulder the burden of overseeing actions by the intelligence
agencies, Cohen said.

   An American photographer has been accused by
the army of throwing stones at Israeli soldiers during a violent
Palestinian protest in the occupied West Bank.
   The army on Tuesday identified the photographer as William
Biggart, and Israel radio said he had been on assignment for the
Village Voice, a weekly newspaper published in New York City.
Biggart and the newspaper denied the army allegations.
   Biggart was detained last week during a Palestinian riot in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest Arab town, the army said. A
spokesman said the photographer was wearing a traditional checkered
Arab headdress and was seen throwing stones at soldiers.
   The army filed a complaint with Nablus police, the spokesman
said, refusing to let his name be used because of military
regulations.
   Martin Gottlieb, editor of the Village Voice, said in New York
that Biggart apparently went to the West Bank to see if he could
take pictures to sell to other news organizations.
   ``He's a free-lance photographer on assignment from us to take
some very routine head-and-shoulder shots and real estate pictures
of the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament),'' Gottlieb said.
   ``He adamantly denies the charges. Our position here is one of
outrage. We think that although he wasn't specifically working for
us on the West Bank, we would have been anxious to see the photos
he took.''
   Gottlieb quoted the photographer as saying: ``It's ridiculous.
I'm 40 years old. I have three kids. I didn't come to Israel to
thrown stones.''
   ``We think he did absolutely nothing wrong and one can only
wonder why Israeli soldiers would concoct charges against this man
at a time when every effort is being made to keep the area closed
to the press,'' Gottlieb said. ``The democratic freedom of the
press seem to be under a severe attack in Israel.''
   He said the paper would lodge a protest with the Israeli
consulate in New York.
   Israel radio said soldiers confiscated Biggart's U.S. passport
and Israeli-issued press card but a senior officer ordered the
passport returned. It said Biggart described himself as a staff
photographer for the Village Voice.
   Biggart had applied twice for an Israeli Government Press Office
card, once with a beard and the second time clean-shaven, the radio
said, and quoted the photographer as saying he ``did not want to
look like a Jewish settler.''
   It said a policeman went to the American Colony Hotel in east
Jerusalem, where Biggert was staying, last Saturday and presented a
summons for a court appearance the next day but Biggart left the
country Sunday.
   A senior official at the U.S. consulate said Biggart was in
touch with a duty officer Saturday night and ``said that he was
summoned to court and that he was due to leave on Sunday. The
officer said he can't give a legal advice.''
   Gottlieb said Biggart gave this description of events:
   On March 7, he was on a street in the Balata Refugee camp when
Israeli soldiers began lobbing tear gas grenades. The soldiers
later charged into the street.
   ``Like everybody else on the street, I began to run. I slipped.
I was the only one who didn't get away.''
   After an Israeli soldier struck him on the legs and ripped the
film out of his camera, an officer took him to a military post and
accused him of throwing rocks.
   His passport was returned but the soldiers kept the press card.
He was presented with a document, written in Hebrew, by a police
officer who spoke only Arabic.
   He left Israel on Sunday after a U.S. consulate official told
him he could leave the country but might have trouble returning.

<HEAD>First Prosecution Witness Takes Stand Against Biaggi</HEAD>

   From 1975 on, Wedtech Corp. deceived federal
agencies into believing it was a minority-controlled business that
qualified for no-bid government contracts, a former company
executive testified Tuesday at the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario
Biaggi.
   Mario Moreno, one of four ex-Wedtech officials who have pleaded
guilty to bribery and other state and federal charges, was the
first prosecution witness to testify at the trial of Biaggi and six
co-defendants.
   Biaggi, a 10-term Bronx Democrat; his eldest son; his former law
partner; and four others are charged with turning Wedtech into a
racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to
win government contracts. Since the allegations became public, the
company has filed for protection under bankruptcy laws and
suspended most operations.
   Moreno, who is cooperating with the government in return for
leniency, also described Biaggi's lobbying efforts on Wedtech's
behalf in 1980 when the company was trying to win an Army contract
to build small engines.
   Prosecutors have charged that Wedtech grew from a small Bronx
machine shop into a $100 million-a-year government contractor, in
part, by falsely portraying itself as minority-controlled, in order
to qualify for a Small Business Administration program that gave
out government contracts without competitive bidding.
   Moreno said he met Wedtech co-founders John Mariotta and Fred
Neuberger in 1976 when he served as consultant for a local program
that assisted small minority-owned businesses.
   Moreno said the pair later told him that Mariotta, who is of
Hispanic descent, owned two-thirds of Wedtech, then known as
Welbilt Electronics Die Corp., and Neuberger owned the other third.
   Mariotta is one of those on trial with Biaggi. Neuberger is one
of the four ex-Wedtech officials cooperating with prosecutors after
pleading guilty to state and federal charges.
   In 1979, Moreno testified, Mariotta and Neuberger ``told me they
each owned 50 percent of the company'' and that they had a
``handshake agreement'' dating back to 1975.
   But the pair did not reveal that Mariotta no longer controlled
the company in records presented to the Small Business
Administration ``in order to comply with the ... regulations,''
Moreno said.
   The witness also said that in 1979, the company had gross
revenues of $1.5 million and about 60 employees but by the
following year ``the company was going bankrupt any minute''
because of a scarcity of funds.
   Moreno said Wedtech was in line to get more than $4 million in
loans through the federal Economic Development Administration in
January 1980, but the loan approval was bottlenecked by an
overworked EDA official in Philadelphia.
   ``We looked for assistance from several people,'' said Moreno,
adding that it came from Biaggi's former law partner and current
co-defendant, Bernard Ehrlich, who took Moreno and Mariotta to seek
the congressman.
   Biaggi turned the matter over to an aide who knew the
Philadelphia EDA official's boss and a month later Wedtech had the
loans approved, said Moreno.
   Wedtech also tried to win an Army contract through the minority
business program. The contract was for small, gasoline-powered
engines even though Wedtech had neither the experience or
facilities to build the engines.
   When the Army turned down Wedtech's first proposal as too high,
company officials again went to Biaggi and Ehrlich for help, said
Moreno.
   Biaggi enlisted the help of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and
the late Rep. Joseph Addabbo, a powerful Queens Democrat, who wrote
the secretary of the Army on behalf of Wedtech, which eventually
got the contract.
   Moreno was scheduled to returned to the stand Wednesday.

   Iran lashed out at the Security Council
again Tuesday, accusing it of wasting time on an arms embargo
proposal instead of ending the deadly missile duel between Tehran
and Baghdad.
   ``The Security Council is responsible for every drop of blood of
Iranian people, innocent civilians who are the victims of inhuman
attacks,'' said Iran's U.N. envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati.
   Mahallati spoke at a news conference after delivering a protest
to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that accused the
council of taking no action to stop the surface-to-surface missile
attacks on the Iranian and Iraqi capitals known as the ``war of the
cities.''
   The most recent phase of the duel began in late February. After
a two day halt, it started again Monday. Iran and Iraq both claim
hundreds of civilian casualties.
   Mahallati blamed the United States for encouraging the attacks
on cities by pushing for a worldwide arms embargo against Iran.
   The embargo would punish Iran for failing to honor the council's
July 20 resolution demanding a cease-fire and withdrawal to pre-war
boundaries as the first step in a negotiated end to the 7{-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   Mahallati told reporters that questions about Iran's position on
the resolution are ``outdated questions.'' Instead, he said, the
council should condemn Iraq for starting the latest round in the
``war of the cities'' and take action to stop the attacks.
   He also accused Iraq of using chemical weapons and intensifying
attacks on neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   Mahallati would not say precisely what Iran wants the council to
do other than condemn Iraq and stop talking about an embargo.
   Iraq blames Iran for starting the missile duel that has killed
scores of civilians since Feb. 29. Both sides describe their
attacks as retaliatory and defensive.
   The United States increased its pressure for an embargo after
Perez de Cuellar ended months of negotiations late last year
proclaiming frustration at Iran's recalcitrance.
   The Soviet Union, which wants better relations with neighboring
Iran, has not agreed to support an embargo. Last week the Soviets
called for more negotiations and a new Security Council resolution
dealing only with the attacks on cities.
   The Soviets acknowledged Monday that they had failed to win
council support for that plan.

   Iran and Iraq blasted each other's cities
Tuesday with missiles, bombs and artillery in apparent attempts to
terrorize each other into submission in a new ``war of the cities.''
   Communiques from both sides, monitored in Nicosia, reported
scores of civilians killed or wounded in the third straight day of
new attacks on population centers.
   ``We are determined to turn Tehran into a hell, the like of
which the barbaric scoundrels have never seen before,'' said the
Iraqi News Agency following another barrage of missiles into Tehran.
   Persian Gulf shipping executives said Iraqi warplanes attacked a
Liberian-flag tanker, chartered by Iran, off the Iranian coast.
   They had no details on casualties or damage aboard the
249,223-ton Trade Fortitude, the second ship damaged in Iraqi raids
in the gulf since March 8.
   Iraq, which has long held the technological edge in the deadly
duel, said it fired six long-range missiles Tuesday into Tehran,
the Iranian capital, while its air force bombed seven cities in
western Iran.
   Iran said it bombarded the southern Iraqi port city of Basra and
Nashwa, 12 miles to the north, with 11 short-range missiles and
artillery fire and hit four other cities in the northeast and
southeast with air raids.
   The Iranians reported no long-range missile attacks on Baghdad,
the Iraqi capital, or any other cities.
   The absence of any missile attack on Baghdad prompted
speculation that the Iranians may have exhausted their arsenal of
long-range missiles in an exchange with the Iraqis that began Feb.
29 and ended for two days last Friday.
   So far, the Iraqis have reported shooting 86 long-range missiles
into Tehran and other Iranian cities in the last 16 days. In
contrast, Iran has claimed to have fired 31 in that period.
   In the gulf, the Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince, one of 11 Kuwait
tankers reflagged with the Stars and Stripes to afford them U.S.
Navy protection from Iranian attack, sailed northward in the 17th
convoy operation this year.
   The convoy was the 39th since July, when the Navy began
escorting the Kuwaiti tankers.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, foreign ministers of six conservative
Gulf Arab states met to discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said a number of civilians
were killed in missile attacks on residential areas of the capital,
but did not say how many rockets hit the city of 6 million.
   Iraq also reported civilian casualties in several cities, but
gave no figures beyond nine killed and 20 wounded in Basra.
   AP reporter Salah Nasrawi reported from Basra on Tuesday that
the city was rocked throughout the day by exploding artillery
shells and Soviet-made Katyusha rockets fired by Iranian forces
east of the city.
   Iranian Revolutionary Guards battled to within six miles of the
city a year ago in a major offensive and have held onto their
bridgehead despite Iraqi counter-attacks.
   Basra's governor, Anwar al-Hadithi, said that more than 2,900
shells and nearly 200 rockets have hit the city since Feb. 28,
killing 50 civilians and wounding around 250 others.
   ``The Katyushas are the worst,'' al-Hadithi said. ``The Iranians
use truck-mounted launchers which means they can fire and run
before our people can locate them. The shrapnel bursts from the
rockets is worse than the shells and they kill more people.''
   Basra was once Iraq's second largest city. But its pre-war
population of 1 million has dwindled to around 300,000 in the last
two years as people fled the Iranian bombardment.
   Western military analysts believe Baghdad, which began hitting
Tehran with missiles for the first time Feb. 29, wants to provoke
Iran into retaliation that will intensify pressure on the U.N.
Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Iran.
   Western diplomats believe the Iraqi strategy is ill-advised
because it has provided the Soviet Union with an excuse to stall on
swinging behind U.S. efforts to secure the embargo.
   Moscow is Iraq's main arms supplier, but has been at pains in
the last two years to improve its relations with Tehran in an
apparent effort to mediate a cease-fire in the war.
   In New York, the Soviets' U.N. ambassador, Alexander Belonogov,
acknowledged Monday that the Soviet bid for a resolution calling
for an end to the ``war of the cities'' had failed. The United
States saw the proposal as a maneuver designed to deflect attention
from the American drive for the embargo on Iran.
   And Iran's U.N. envoy lashed out at the Security Council,
accusing it of ``wasting'' time on the arms embargo proposal
instead of ending the missile duel between Tehran and Baghdad.
   ``The Security Council is responsible for every drop of blood of
Iranian people, innocent civilians who are the victims of inhuman
attacks,'' said the envoy, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati.

   Two Roman Catholics were shot
dead and hearses bearing the coffins of three Irish Republican Army
guerrillas were pelted with stones by jeering Protestants, police
said Tuesday.
   Charles McGrillan was gunned down from a motorcycle outside a
Belfast supermarket as he arrived for work Tuesday, police said.
   His death bore the hallmarks of a sectarian murder by Protestant
terrorists, they said.
   The night before, police said, troops shot a gunman who fired on
an army patrol near the Belfast home of one of the dead guerrillas.
Kevin McCracken, 33, who had a record of IRA activity, died later
in the hospital.
   The three guerrillas, killed in Gibraltar March 6 by a British
anti-terrorism squad as they were planning a car bombing, were to
be buried Wednesday in the biggest such funeral since 1981, when 10
guerrillas died in prison hunger strikes.
   Catholic sympathy for Mairead Farrell, 31, Sean Savage, 24, and
Daniel McCann, 30, is heightened by the fact that they were
unarmed, and the Irish government has protested they shouldn't have
been killed.
   The Rev. Raymond Murray, chaplain of the Armagh Jail where Miss
Farrell spent 10 years on a bombing charge, denounced the killings
at a Mass for her Tuesday night in West Belfast.
   ``She was done to death, barbarously assaulted by a gunman as
she walked in public on a sunny Sunday afternoon,'' he told 2,000
people crowded into a Catholic church.
   The three bodies were flown from Gibraltar to Dublin on Monday
and driven for nine hours in a cortege to Belfast, 100 miles north.
   Thousands of IRA sympathizers waved black flags of mourning
along highway, while at six points along the 40-mile Northern
Ireland segment of the route, the three hearses were stoned and
jeered by Protestants to whom the predominantly Catholic IRA is a
mortal enemy.
   At the Ireland-Ulster border, the procession ran into Northern
Ireland police demanding the removal of Irish flags draped over the
coffins. After 30 minutes of argument the mourners compromised by
folding the flags, replacing them on the coffins and covering them
in wreathes.
   The tricolor, Ireland's national flag, is identified in most
Protestant minds with the IRA.
   The outlawed IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, said police
tried to break up the cortege and twice crashed a vehicle into a
hearse.
   At Newry, five miles inside Northern Ireland, the hearses were
paraded around the largely Catholic town for two hours in front of
cheering IRA supporters.
   On Newry's outskirts, Protestant crowds jeered, waved British
flags and hurled bricks, bottles and stones at the cortege,
breaking some car windows.
   Similar scenes repeated themselves along the road to Belfast.
   On Monday the IRA said its members fired a volley over a
makeshift shrine in Belfast as a farewell salute to the guerrillas.
   The traditional paramilitary salute, which is banned in Northern
Ireland as an illegal display of firearms, was fired Monday as the
bodies landed in Dublin, the IRA said in a statement issued through
Sinn Fein.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
promised in newspaper advertisements not to interfere with the
funerals if the IRA did not mount a gunfire salute over the coffins.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams accused the the police of
partially splitting up the convoy, sending cars with relatives of
the three guerrillas into mainly Protestant Lisburn, eight miles
outside Belfast where they were stoned.
   In Belfast, Adams said, the RUC ``hijacked the three hearses by
forcing them down to Broadway and refused to allow the remaining
relatives to accompany their loved ones.''
   Police said that near Belfast they separated the hearses from
the rest of the slow-moving funeral procession, which had grown to
several miles in length.
   The coffins were taken to the homes of the guerrillas' families
in Belfast. They will be buried at Belfast's Catholic Milltown
Cemetery alongside many other IRA guerrillas killed in nearly 20
years of strife in the province.
   Since 1969, 2,630 people have died in sectarian violence. The
IRA is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite
the province with Ireland.

   A Democratic fund-raiser on whose behalf House
Speaker Jim Wright once interceded was indicted Tuesday in an
alleged scheme to defraud an Iowa thrift institution in a land deal.
   Thomas Merrill Gaubert, 48, of DeSoto, Texas, was accused by a
federal grand jury in Des Moines, Iowa, of arranging for the
Capitol Savings and Loan Association of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, to
unwittingly finance a ``land flip'' in Dallas County, Texas.
   Gaubert bought some 44 acres of the Dallas County land at less
than 50 cents per square foot, then sold it the same day through a
middleman to 22 buyers at $5.25 per square foot, the indictment
alleged.
   He also was accused of denying involvement in the project and
failing to disclose to S&L regulators, as well as state and federal
regulators, that during the transaction he was to be a buyer and a
seller of the land.
   The real estate developer was accused of wire fraud, making
false statements to a federally insured financial institution and
making a false statement to the government.
   Gaubert is a prominent Democratic fund-raiser and former owner
of the Independent American Savings Association in Irving, Texas,
who contributed $7,000 to a pair of Wright political committees in
1985.
   In the fall of 1986, Wright, D-Texas, then House majority
leader, urged Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Edwin Gray to
meet with Gaubert to hear his complaints about the board's
treatment of Independent American.
   At Wright's urging, Gray spent 2{ hours with Gaubert. Wright
said he was simply encouraging Gray to ensure that his agency was
being fair to one of Wright's constituents.
   The S&L industry in Texas is focus of a massive federal criminal
investigative effort that has resulted in a number of indictments
of prominent businessmen. Gaubert has called the federal effort ``a
witchunt.''
   Texas leads the nation in S&L losses and failures, and federal
insurance officials say fraud, inside abuse and gross mismanagement
have contributed to the problem as well as the economic recession
in Texas.
   The maximum penalty for wire fraud is a $1,000 fine and five
years in prison. Making false statements to a federally insured
financial institution carries a maximum $5,000 fine and two years
in prison. Making false statements to the government carries a
maximum $10,000 fine and 10 years in prison.

   Former National Security Council staff aide
Roger W. Robinson made a 2{-hour federal grand jury appearance
Tuesday in the criminal investigation of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   Robinson declined to discuss his testimony following his
appearance. He was the aide designated by then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane in June 1985 to work on expediting the
pipeline, which was floundering for lack of an insurance package
sought by Iraq to insure it from Israeli attack.
   Robinson was assigned to get the project back on track following
a meeting by McFarlane, longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach and
Wallach's client Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the
proposed pipeline. Meese had referred Wallach to McFarlane the
previous month.
   Working with Wallach, Robinson tried unsuccessfully to help
assemble a $400 million bank-backed insurance package acceptable to
the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   The government agency insures foreign investments by U.S. firms
such as Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the project.
OPIC officials wanted guarantees that funds would be available from
some source to cover losses if the pipeline were destroyed.
   Robinson is the second NSC aide in two weeks to testify in the
probe of Meese being conducted by independent counsel James McKay.
The other was David Wigg, who took Robinson's place on the project.
   Two former aides in Meese's office, John Richardson and John
Harrison, testified last week before the grand jury to which
McKay's office is presenting evidence. Richardson was Meese's chief
of staff before leaving the Justice Department several months ago.
Harrison, now with the solicitor general's office, worked on
Meese's staff in mid-1985.
   The probe of Meese revolves around whether he may have violated
the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes by
U.S. companies or their agents to foreign officials.
   Wallach wrote a memo to the attorney general in September 1985
saying that a portion of up to $700 million from the pipeline would
be paid to the Israeli Labor Party of then-Prime Minister Shimon
Peres. Meese says he doesn't recall reading the portion of the memo
relating to Labor Party payments.
   Robinson left the NSC on Sept. 14, 1985, and his place on the
pipeline project was taken by Wigg, who worked with Wallach on
alternative proposals. Those included pledging U.S. aid to Israel
as a guarantee for the pipeline and seeking to put Pentagon budget
money for Israel in an overseas escrow account as insurance.
   None of the insurance proposals was adopted and the pipeline
wasn't built.
   On Tuesday afternoon, John H. McNeill of the Pentagon office of
general counsel appeared before the grand jury.
   McNeill worked with Wigg on the Pentagon budget proposal,
according to sources familiar with McKay's probe, speaking on
condition of anonymity. McNeill, who declined comment on his
testimony, is the assistant general counsel for international and
intelligence matters.
   McNeill and Robinson are both witnesses in the probe rather than
subjects or targets and do not have legal counsel.

   Medical workers hurled firebombs at
police outside a hospital on Tuesday, joining a wave of public
employees rallying against the cash-strapped government of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Sections of the capital were turned into battlegrounds as
hundreds of civil servants took to the streets to demand their
paychecks. Riot squads fired tear gas, water cannons and shotguns
loaded with birdshot. At least a dozen people were injured.
   Americans became involved.
   _Panama ordered Terence Kneebone, director of the U.S.
Information Service here, to leave the country within 48 hours, a
U.S. Embassy source said. The United States said it would ignore
the directive because it was delivered by a regime not recognized
by the United States as the legitimate authority.
   _The U.S. Southern Command said Panamanian police detained three
American soldiers in the port of Colon, at the Caribbean entrance
of the Panama Canal, but released them several hours later. The
command also said it upgraded the alert status for its 10,000
personnel and 20,000 dependents.
   _A photographer for the Dallas Morning News, David Leeson, was
among those hurt in the worst demonstration at the main Social
Security Institute hospital in northern Panama City. A shotgun
pellet pierced his cheek and chipped a tooth.
   Leeson was treated at the hospital's emergency room, along with
at least seven othe people. Three were hit in the face by birdshot
and two children were overcome by tear gas.
   Other slightly wounded demonstrators spurned hospital care.
   Medical workers hurled Molotov cocktails at police just outside
the grounds of the sprawling facility and riot police responded
with shotgun fire and tear gas grenades. Fumes penetrated the
interior of the 500-bed hospital.
   ``Assassins,'' cried hospital employees. ``Noriega, tyrant, your
end is near!''
   The complex includes the six-story hospital, a specialized
clinic and administrative offices.
   Several miles away, in the heart of the city, police spraying
diluted tear gas from a water cannon broke up a demonstration by
about 300 teachers and employees of the Ministry of Education.
   Disturbances flared Monday when thousands of public employees
failed to receive semimonthly paychecks. Strikes begun by teachers,
telephone workers and longshoremen were joined Tuesday by employees
of the Ministry of Treasury and Finance.
   The government announced it would begin making at least partial
salary payments Tuesday to its employees. But workers at the
hospital, the treasury and education departments said they had not
heard of the plan.
   It was not known late Tuesday how many workers actually got
paid, either in full or partially.
   ``We were protesting peacefully because we were supposed to get
paid yesterday (Monday) and we still do not know anything,'' said a
nurse, who refused to give her name. ``I had to borrow money from
my grandfather to come to work.''
   In Washington, the Reagan administration has let it be known it
hopes Panama's difficulties in meeting its payrolls will lead to
strongman Noriega's removal as head of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces.
   Two U.S. grand juries indicted Noriega last month on charges of
trafficking in drugs. Noriega denied the charges.
   Riot police stepped in to quell the demonstration at the Social
Security hospital when workers built barricades of rubbish across a
four-lane, divided highway, halting heavy morning rush-hour traffic
in both directions.
   Firing tear gas grenades, police moved the workers back behind a
heavy wire fence surrounding the hospital. Some employees, wearing
surgical masks against the gas, used metal tabletops as shields to
throw rocks at the police.
   Then some workers, mostly young men, made firebombs and hurled
them at police. They used surgical gauze for wicks after pouring
gasoline into empty rum bottles.
   Other employees were seen throwing furniture from upstairs
windows of the six-story hospital. At least one policeman was
struck on the head by a rock.
   ``This is a hospital!,'' cried a nurse. ``How can they do this!
We are under siege!''
   Students threw rocks at police from a university building across
the highway.
   Treasury Minister Hector Alexander said the government planned
to pay workers on a sliding scale. Employees making less than $200
a month would get full wages. Those getting up to $999 would get
$75. People making more than $1000 would get nothing.
   More than 1,000 dockworkers remained on strike at Colon and
Panama City, the entrances to the the 50-mile-long Panama Canal
that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
   The Panama Canal Commission said Tuesday the walkout had not
affected transit through the waterway, which handles an average 30
ships a day.
   The Reagan administration hopes government inability to pay its
workers will bring down Noriega, who engineered the ouster of
President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried to
fire him.
   The United States imposed new economic sanctions on Panama last
Friday, including withholding $6.5 million in canal fees due this
week. It earlier cut off all economic and military aid to Panama.
   Foreign and local banks have remained closed in Panama.
   In Washington, the Panamanian Embassy said Delvalle instructed
Ambassador Juan B. Sosa that once Noriega is gone, ``all funds that
have been frozen in escrow will be primarily used to pay the salary
of public workers, a duty that the illegimate government has been
unable to accomplish.''
   Sosa refused to recognize the Feb. 26 change in government and
continues to support Delvalle.
   Asked Tuesday about the possibility of waiving extradition to
speed Noriega's departure from Panama, President Reagan said, ``We
do want Noriega out of there and a return to a civilian democratic
government.''

   The pilot of a Soviet jetliner that crashed
killing 11 passengers allowed his co-pilot to try a difficult night
landing for which he was not prepared, a government commission said
Tuesday.
   The government newspaper Izvestia published the findings of a
commission that studied the crash of an Aeroflot Tu-154B at the
Caspian Sea port of Krasnovodsk on Jan. 18.
   It said prosecutors have started criminal proceedings in the
case.
   The three-engine jet, carrying 137 passengers from Moscow to
Krasnovodsk and then on to Ashkabad was flying normally until the
approach to Krasnovodsk in the early morning hours, the report said.
   Pilot V.S. Churayev permitted co-pilot V.D. Yegorov to land the
plan, even though Yegorov was not trained sufficiently for landing
in the difficult conditions at Krasnovodsk, according to the report.
   The report did not say why the landing in Krasnovodsk was
difficult.
   It said Yegorov made mistakes in his approach that brought the
plane down too rapidly from a height of 150 feet and even though
Churayev took over the controls at the last minute, the plane
flipped over on landing and broke in two.
   It was one of three times this year that passengers were killed
in Aeroflot flight crashes reported by the Soviet media.
   On Feb. 27 a Tupolev 134 crashed at the Siberian city of Sumgut.
The media said there were casualties, but did not say how many.
   On March 8, a family musical group from Irkutsk tried to hijack
a Tupolev 154 bound for Leningrad. A stewardess, three passengers
and five of the hijackers were killed before the plane was retaken
by security officers.

<HEAD>Early Federal Strategy Would Have Singled Out Biggest Drug Rings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Justice Department's criminal
division said Tuesday that an early draft of a federal prosecution
strategy against drugs would have targeted resources almost
exclusively at the world's 150 biggest narcotics rings.
   Assistant Attorney General William Weld said the approach has
been broadened after extensive discussions with U.S. attorneys so
that smaller operations will be targeted in federal drug
prosecutions.
   ``I want that dealer in Lowell, Mass., not to be sure he won't
be picked up in a federal undercover operation,'' Weld, a former
U.S. attorney in Boston, said in an interview. ``I don't want
people to be able to relax anywhere.''
   Weld said that when he first considered focusing exclusively on
the largest drug rings, ``I ran into a little bit of a buzz saw''
from some U.S. attorneys.
   Committing ``an untoward percentage of those resources to Miami,
New York, Chicago'' and the other major drug centers ``creates the
public perception of gaps in enforcement,'' said Weld. ``The bad
guys are going to play hit 'em where they ain't.''
   ``If we were going to be entirely logical we might say the only
purpose of prosecution is to disrupt the supply'' by aiming ``at
the top-most levels of supply in the world,'' Weld said. Abandoning
regions of the country would send a mixed signal that ``it's not OK
to be a member of the Medillin cartel, but it is OK to be a little
fish.''
   Of the refinements, he said: ``Frankly, I'm happier with the
compromise than I was with my own first draft.''
   The prosecution strategy is one proposed piece of the federal
drug-fighting effort now being mapped out by a number of agencies.
The proposals, now in final form, will be presented to the National
Drug Policy Board for approval and will be publicly announced by
early next month.

   The 159-nation General Assembly is
expected to ask the World Court to rule on whether the United
States can close the PLO's U.N. observer mission in New York, an
Arab League spokesman said Tuesday.
   League spokesman Clovis Maksoud and U.N. sources said the
assembly would convene Friday.
   The U.S. Justice Department has said it would move on or around
Monday to enforce a new anti-terrorism law calling for the closure
of the Palestine Liberation Organization's mission office.
   Maksoud said the League will ask the assembly to take a cautious
approach.
   He said it will not ask the assembly to suspend Israel from
debates on the Middle East, as the PLO has suggested, or to move to
another country. Both would be premature, he said.
   ``The provocation was reckless. We don't want to respond with
recklessness,'' Maksoud said in an interview.
   Scores of nations said during a special session earlier this
month on the PLO dispute that the independence of the United
Nations is at stake.
   The increasingly bitter confrontation has prompted some calls to
move the world body to Geneva, which Western diplomats say is
unlikely.
   ``Nobody wants to move the headquarters,'' Maksoud said.
   U.N. sources said Tuesday that preliminary studies show the cost
of moving the assembly to Geneva would be ``excessive,'' in part
because U.N. facilities there are not adequate.
   Both the United Nations and the U.S. State Department have said
closing the PLO mission would violate the 1947 treaty under which
the United States became U.N. headquarters.
   Maksoud said the Arab League will not ask the United Nations to
go to federal court to fight the Justice Department.
   He said the United Nations should not subject itself to the
jurisdiction of a domestic court.
   Instead, the League will ask the assembly to request a ruling
from the World Court in the Hague on whether the United States has
the right to close down any mission to the United Nations.
   The PLO, an official observer at the General Assembly since
1974, has said it will apppear in a U.S. court only if ``dragged
in,'' and then only to challenge the court's jurisdiction over a
U.N. matter.

   A woman who claims she was a lover of Gov.
Evan Mecham's chief accuser testified at Mecham's impeachment trial
Tuesday about the relationship despite the presiding officer's
order to keep sex out of the trial.
   Defense witness Christina Johnston told senators she was
``intimate'' with the state's top lawman, Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead.
   Milstead has testified that Mecham ordered him not to cooperate
with an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official against a prospective grand jury witness. Milstead has
said he did cooperate.
   The alleged obstruction of the death-threat probe is one of
three broad charges against Mecham at his impeachment trial. He
also is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and of
misusing $80,000 from a state fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   Mecham, 63, a first-term Republican and the first U.S. governor
to face an impeachment trial in six decades, has not attended since
the proceedings began Feb. 29.
   The defense has claimed it can raise Milstead's sexual
activities to attack his crediblity and character, but Arizona
Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon Jr. earlier ruled the
issue irrelevant.
   Prosecuting attorney Paul Eckstein repeatedly objected Tuesday
that Mrs. Johnston's testimony, elicited by Mecham lawyer Fred
Craft, violated Gordon's order, but she managed some comment on
their relationship.
   Mrs. Johnston testified she had known Milstead since 1979 and
had no professional relationship with him.
   ``Have you had a personal relationship with him?'' asked Craft.
   ``Intimate and personal,'' she answered in a forceful voice
before a prosecutor could object.
   Milstead has said he knew her as a DPS informant, but he was not
asked about a sexual relationship.
   Mrs. Johnston and her husband, Mark, a former DPS officer, have
said publicly they are ``out to get'' Milstead.
   Craft angrily declared Tuesday he was being prevented from
``getting at the truth'' as he asked Mrs. Johnston personal
questions, including why she had been married six times. She said
she was not married when she met Ralph Milstead.
   ``Was he married?'' Craft asked.
   ``He told me he wasn't,'' she said with a smile as the
prosecution objected.
   The judge began sustaining a blizzard of prosecution objections,
and Craft finally sputtered: ``Maybe I just don't understand the
rules.''
   ``That may be a good statement,'' said Gordon.
   Mrs. Johnston was permitted to denounce Milstead as a liar.
   ``He's a liar. He's corrupt. He's an egomaniac and he's
power-hungry,'' Mrs. Johnston declared as she was asked by Mecham's
lawyer to evaluate Milstead's truthfulness. ``I'm sorry, but that's
the truth,'' she added softly.
   Milstead has said that Mark Johnston quit the force under
strange circumstances, disappearing for about a week while on duty.
He said that Mrs. Johnston recently had sought her husband's
reinstatement with the DPS but that he had failed a psychological
test.
   House prosecutor William French accused Craft of creating a
smokescreen with claims of witness-tampering to disguise that
``apparently there is no defense.''
   Among Craft's allegations was the arrest of defense witness
Terri Fields on Friday, the day after she testified, on an
outstanding warrant charging that she failed to attend
court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings following a
driving-while-intoxicated conviction. She was released on $1,000
bond. The DPS has denied the arrest was an attempt to intimidate
impeachment trial witnesses.
   French, in response to Craft's claim that DPS officers were
intimidating witnesses, submitted an explosive affidavit from a
defense witness.
   Antonio Corio claimed that Craft spewed profanity at him, made
bizarre claims about Milstead's sex life and threatened to ``tear
up'' the witness if he didn't give the right answers.
   Craft later called those allegations ``scurrilous in the
extreme. ... It's a lie.''
   Milstead is in Israel for an anti-terrorism seminar, but DPS
spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt called the alleged statements by Craft
``disgusting.'' Asked for further comment, he said, ``You can't
print it.''
   The Senate did not immediately rule on a mistrial motion by
Craft based on the tampering allegations, and continued the
proceedings.
   The Senate also made no decision Tuesday on a proposal to extend
the length of the trial day by two hours to speed up the
proceedings. Craft said it would be a hardship for defense
attorneys and the judge indicated he felt the current schedule
already is longer and more arduous than a normal trial schedule.
   Senate Republican Majority Leader Robert Usdane said the matter
would be reconsidered later in the week.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict Mecham.
The senators could vote again and bar the governor from holding
state office again. Mecham also faces an April 21 criminal trial on
the charge that he concealed the $350,000 loan, and a recall
election is scheduled May 17.

   Lord Hugh Rupert Courtenay sold his bookshelves
and got to keep them, too, on Tuesday, for a record-setting
$841,750.
   London's Victoria and Albert Museum bought the two antique
bookcases but agreed to let Courtenay keep them so long as they are
on show to the public in his library.
   The museum said the price was a record for a piece of English
furniture sold in Britain.
   The bookcases will stay in Courtenay's ancestral home, Powderham
Castle, Devon, which Courtenay runs for his father, the 17th Earl
of Devon.
   The bookcases were made in 1740 by John Channon of Exeter. The
museum was given the money by the National Heritage Fund, a charity
which preserves historic objects for the nation.
   Courtenay, 46, said he loses $74,000 a year on the castle and
needs more than $1.85 million to pay taxes and fund improvements in
the castle.

   About 10,000 people chanting
``Democracy! Democracy!'' marched through the streets of this
communist capital Tuesday and called for a free press and free
elections.
   Police turned out in force, but took no action as protesters
yelled anti-government slogans and speakers criticized the Soviet
system.
   The throng marched several miles down Budapest's main
boulevards, blocking traffic and waving red, white and green
Hungarian flags.
   The unofficial protest followed a rally organized earlier in the
day by the Communist Party to mark the anniversary of Hungary's
abortive 1848 revolution against Austria, one of this East European
nation's biggest holidays.
   ``The time is over for self-appointed governments,'' prominent
dissident Gabor Miklos Tamas told the throng, in a reference to the
nation's communist authorities. ``A modern democracy has to be
created with a new constitution and free elections.''
   The crowd marched to monuments of Hungarian national heroes and
paid particular tribute to firebrand poet Sandor Petoefi, whose
name is symbolic of resistance to foreign suppression in Hungary.
   Protesters chanted ``Democracy! Democracy!'' and waved banners
reading, ``We want real reforms'' or ``We demand freedom of the
press.''
   Later Tuesday night, a crowd of about 1,500, most of them young
people, gathered at the Petoefi monument and then moved across the
Margaret bridge to the Castle Hill, where they repeated calls for
democracy and press freedom.
   About 150 people then moved back to the Chain bridge, intending
to return to the Petoefi monument, but witnesses said the
demonstrators were dispersed by waiting riot police, who held clubs
but did not hit anybody.
   Hours after the unofficial demonstration was over, the state
news agency MTI reported that eight people, mostly dissident
intellectuals, were arrested. The five-line report gave only their
names.
   They were writer Miklos Haraszti, sociologist Ottlia Solt,
publisher Gabor Demszky, artist Tamas Molnar, Gyoergy Gado, Jenoe
Nagy and two lesser known dissidents, Sandor Racz and Robert
Palinkas.
   Haraszti later said he had been released and that he assumed the
others had also been set free, but this could not be confirmed
immediately.
   Hungarian dissidents have staged unofficial demonstrations on
March 15 since 1973. Police generally have shown restraint,
although dozens of officers clashed violently with protesters in
1986.
   Hungary has won a reputation as a relatively liberal Soviet bloc
country, although far less dissent is tolerated than in Western
countries.
   At Tuesday's rally, groups of protesters whistled and applauded
rhythmically as police vehicles passed by, but authorities did not
react to what appeared to be attempts to provoke them.
   Roza Demszky, the wife of one of the arrested dissidents, read
her husband's speech to the crowd.
   The Soviet system has led Hungary into a crisis ``and does not
show any way out,'' she said.
   The reforms promised by the Hungarian revolution of 1848 ``have
not yet been realized in this country,'' she added.
   Speakers gathered at a monument to Lajos Kossuth, the leader of
the 1848 revolt, to read poems by Petoefi.
   In the earlier official rally, a crowd of 5,000 people gathered
near Budapest's National Museum, where the 1848 revolution first
began.
   Communist Party speakers called for more national unity and
economic progress, and laid a plaque commemorating the revolution.
   Small groups dressed in folk costumes sang national songs and
told events of the aborted revolution.
   Hungary recently has imposed an austerity program to try to
reverse economic stagnation, and its leadership is contemplating
political reforms.

   An American communications satellite launched
into a low orbit last week rocketed successfully Tuesday into a
geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth's equator.
   The satellite, Spacenet III, owned by GTE Corp., fired its
apogee kick motor, a small rocket engine, at 11:57 a.m. EST, some
90 hours after its launch Friday night by a French Ariane rocket.
   GTE officials said the 1,562-pound Spacenet III would initiate a
stabilizing spin Tuesday night. This will lock its antennae into
contact with Earth. Once that is accomplished and verified, the
satellite will deploy an array of solar power cells that provide
the craft with electricity.
   GTE engineers will conduct a series of tests of the craft and
the the satellite will start operations early in April.
   Spacenet III provides a communications link between points in
all 50 of the United States. Clients include The Associated Press
and the television groups of ABC, CBS, CNN and Gannett.
   The U.S. satellite and a French communications satellite were
launched together on Friday aboard an Ariane rocket from the
European Space Agency launch site in Kourou, French Guiana. GTE
Spacenet is the first American client of Arianespace, the operating
arm of the European Space Agency.

   All blood samples taken for routine clinical
testing at 40 hospitals in 30 states now are also being tested for
AIDS, the director of Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday.
   Dr. James Mason, director of the CDC, said at a congressional
hearing that ``blinded'' blood tests are being conducted at the
hospitals in an effort to help determine the incidence of AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., a member of the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment,
asked Mason if he was aware that California has a law that forbids
AIDS testing without consent.
   ``Then I sure am committing lots of crimes every day,'' said
Mason.
   An official with the California state committee on AIDS such
certain ``blinded'' tests are legal.
   Mason said the tests were under way in hospitals in both San
Francisco and Los Angeles.
   Mason said results of the testing are now being compiled and
will be released to the public in two to three weeks.
   In the ``blinded'' tests, said Mason, a portion of each routine
blood sample taken at the hospitals is separated out and then
tested for AIDS. He said the blood used for the AIDS testing
carries no identification of the patient who provided the sample,
hence the identity of the donor is ``blinded'' to the laboratory
conducting the tests.
   Debra Smith, administrative secretary to a California state
committee on AIDS, said the ``blinded'' tests are legal. She said a
statute passed in 1987 permits such tests for statistical purposes.
   Mason's statement came during hearings chaired by Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif., into the way that the nation's AIDS research
dollars are being spent.
   Mason, along with Dr. Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration, and Dr. James Wyngaarden, director of the
National Institutes of Health, all said they were experiencing
difficulty in hiring scientists and other health care professionals
because the federal salaries are below those offered in
universities or in industry.
   Wyngaarden said that the turnover among investigators is about 2
percent a year.
   ``We're losing some of our most outstanding people,'' he said,
for reasons that involved salary, laboratory facilities and other
``complex'' reasons.
   He said this is particularly true of allied health workers, such
as nurses, laboratory technicians and X-ray technicians. He said
there is a salary differential among those workers of about 25
percent.
   ``They will stay through the training period and then leave for
more money,'' said Wyngaarden.
   Dr. Tony Fauci, deputy director for AIDS research at NIH, said
top investigators frequently receive offers to move to university
or industry positions that offer a higher salary, better facilities
and more laboratory personnel.
   ``There is a rather significant difference in salaries (between
federal and private),'' he said. ``We are constantly fighting that
battle.''
   Fauci said the outpatient clinic at the NIH treated 4,500 AIDs
patients during 1987 and that more and more of them are becoming
critically ill and in need of intensive care.
   ``The staff problems will have a negative impact'' on the amount
of care available at the clinics, he said.
   Young said his agency is experiencing difficulty in recruiting
personnel trained to evaluate drugs and medical issues. He said it
typically takes about two years to train personnel, and they often
leave the FDA shortly after the training is completed in order to
receive higher pay elsewhere.

   Frustrated, angry and unwilling to admit defeat,
Bob Dole insisted there was a turning point out there, a state
where voters would say, ``Wait a minute, we don't want George
Bush.'' But Dole's campaign was hard-pressed to identify that
turnaround state.
   It wasn't likely to happen in Connecticut, one of the states
Bush calls home. And the Republican presidential polls don't look
promising for Dole in Wisconsin, New York or Pennsylvania.
   ``So that takes us another month and a half without a big
opportunity for a victory,'' said one top Dole adviser, insisting
on anonymity.
   Before the polls opened Tuesday in Illinois, Dole conceded that
big state to Bush.
   With Bush continuing to build his delegate lead, Dole was dogged
by the question of how long he could or would stay in the race.
   When Dole returned to Washington Tuesday night, he insisted,
``We're just going to hang in there. ... We're staying in, we're
staying in.''
   Was there a realistic chance of catching the vice president?
   The numbers suggested there wasn't.
   Going into the Illinois primary, Bush already had 705 of the
1,139 delegates needed for the nomination. Dole had 165.
   Bush would need only one-third of the 1,318 delegates still to
be chosen.
   Obviously, if Dole started winning two-thirds of the delegates
in upcoming contests, the vice president's huge lead would
evaporate. But there was no sign of that happening.
   The Iran-Contra affair appeared to offer a bit of hope to Dole.
   When Robert McFarlane agreed to cooperate with the special
counsel investigating the affair, it renewed the hope within the
Dole campaign that attention once again would focus on what role
Bush had in deliberations that led to the sale of arms to Iran and
diversion of funds to the Contras.
   In a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Dole
referred to presidential advisers ``peddling arms to the ayatollah
while others hear no evil, see no evil.''
   But he later conceded that Iran-Contra was not an issue among
Republicans, though he predicted it would be used against the
party's nominee by the Democrats.
   Dole's frustration was apparent when he was asked why he didn't
attack Bush more directly on Iran-Contra.
   ``If I hit him, I get Ronald Reagan first and then they say, oh,
oh, he's out there attacking Ronald Reagan,'' he replied.
   Nothing so frustrates and angers Dole as Bush's success in tying
himself to Reagan, a president who remains enormously popular among
Republicans.
   Dole referred to Bush commercials that show the vice president
conferring with Reagan and, in one scene, the president putting an
arm over Bush's shoulders.
   ``I don't have nearly as many pictures of Ronald Reagan as
George Bush has,'' said Dole. ``He must have a pile six feet deep.
I can't match him in photos. But I can match him in record.''
   Bush blew the Republican race open with his sweeping victory on
Super Tuesday.
   But Dole is reluctant to give the vice president credit for
accomplishing anything on his own. ``Super Tuesday was, in my view,
a referendum on Ronald Reagan and Reagan won,'' said the senator.
   He sees Bush as someone who has ``sort of had a charmed life in
politics. He's gotten quite a ways without ever doing much.''
   That view may contribute to Dole's belief that it could all
unravel for Bush if he can ``get people to stop and think.''
   The senator admitted he has considered various tactics that
might blunt the Bush momentum, including borrowing one from Ronald
Reagan _ naming his running mate. Reagan tried that in 1976 when he
challenged incumbent Republican President Ford.
   Reagan, fighting to overcome a perception that he was too
conservative, said early in the race he would name moderate
Republican Sen. Richard Schweicker of Pennsylvania as his running
mate.
   It didn't work for Reagan, but as Dole said, ``When you're
looking for ways to catch up, you think of maybe naming your
running mate.'' One of the names on Dole's list was former Gov.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. He said there were others, but he
didn't name them.
   On election day in Illinois, Dole campaigned in Wisconsin and
Connecticut.
   But Connecticut, with 35 delegates, is the state where Bush grew
up and where his father served as a senator. Connecticut didn't
look like a good state for Dole, said the senator's adviser.
   Polls in Wisconsin, which chooses 47 delegates in a primary on
April 5, gave Bush a big lead. Only a Dole victory in Illinois
seemed likely to turn it around.
   The biggest upcoming prize is New York, which elects 102 GOP
delegates on April 19. Bush has already been credited with 24 of
those because his backers are running unopposed in several
districts.
   A week later, Pennsylvania, with 78 delegates, votes, and the
Dole adviser described the state as ``controlled pretty tightly''
by Bush.
   Even while claiming he was going to fight on, Dole showed
glimpses of the political realist.
   He referred to candidates who don't realize when it's time to
bow out.
   He said, ``Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in
the wind for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a
little, maybe somebody has to cut the rope.''

   A Naval paymaster was found
beaten and strangled Tuesday aboard the destroyer USS John Hancock
and $120,000 was stolen from the ship's safe, a naval spokesman
said.
   The officer's body was found stuffed into a sea locker in
another part of the ship, said Chief Petty Officer Art Riccio. ``He
was beaten up pretty bad.'' Later, officials said the victim,
identified as for Lt. Ratish Prasad, 24, of Park Forest, Ill., also
had been strangled.
   The search for Prasad began when he failed to report to muster
at 7:15 a.m., said Riccio. Mayport Petty Officer Billy Hill said
Tuesday evening that nobody else was known to be missing from the
ship.
   A search of the disbursement office found the safe open and
$120,000 in cash and an undetermined number of blank checks
missing, Riccio said.
   Tuesday was payday for Navy personnel, who are paid the first
and 15th of each month, said Riccio. ``An audit of the ship's funds
is pending and alternate arrangements have been made to pay the
crew,'' he said.
   Navy and Jacksonville sheriff's investigators were working on
the case, he said.
   Mayport is the Hancock's home port. Access to the ship, which
was tied in the port, is strictly controlled, said Riccio. Anyone
wanting to board must pass checkpoints at the base entrance, the
pier area and the ship itself.
   Only relatives and friends of the crew who have been previously
cleared are allowed aboard the ship in port, he said. Even Navy
personnel who do not have business on the ships cannot board, he
said.
   Construction workers doing repairs can go aboard, but Riccio
said the Hancock had no repair work scheduled.
   The Navy refuses to comment on whether nuclear weapons are
aboard a vessel, but destroyers do not ususally carry such arms.

   Nicaraguan forces, using aerial bombardment
and heavy artillery, launched a major offensive Tuesday against
Contra rebels in the northern part of the country and sent troops
into neighboring Honduras, U.S. and Contra officials said.
   ``They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said Ernesto
Palazio, director of the Contra's Washington office.
   Palazio estimated that about 3,500 front line Sandinista forces
aided by 4,000 backup troops were involved.
   In Managua, Nicaraguan officials confirmed that a ``major
military offensive'' had been launched, but denied that Sandinista
forces had penetrated into Honduran territory.
   The operation occurred less than a week before the rescheduled
resumption of cease-fire talks and some Democrats in Congress
pictured it as a Sandinista attempt to go into the negotiations
from a stronger position.
   One State Department official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said initial reports suggested the Sandinistas hoped to
deliver a ``knockout blow'' against the Contras.
   The military engagements came shortly after a 1{-hour White
House meeting at which President Reagan pleaded with congressional
leaders for a renewal of American aid to the Contras, but met an
icy reception from Democrats.
   Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said Reagan
pounded the table and said, ``There are some people around this
table who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.''
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the Sandinistas'
Soviet-made Antonov planes dropped 500 to 1,000-pound bombs on
Contra troop concentrations.
   He said Contra air resupply capability is extremely limited. The
rebels are low on food and lack the ability to evacuate their
wounded, he said.
   In Miami, Marta Sacasa, another spokesman for the resistance,
said the Sandinistas struck at Contra positions with heavy
artillery, including multiple rocket launchers.
   ``The situation is critical,'' she said.
   The State Department said earlier that preparations by
government forces appeared to foreshadow ``the largest offensive we
have seen the Sandinistas undertake.''
   But House Democratic aides, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the offensive by Sandinista troops was merely
``business as usual'' and an attempt to ``soften up'' the Contras
before the cease-fire negotiations resume.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., acknowledged that
``there is some military activity'' in the country, but declined to
elaborate.
   ``We don't know their intentions, and they (the administration)
don't know their intentions,'' said one Democratic congressional
source.
   Another Democratic congressional source said it was clear that
the Contras are having supply problems, in part because of an
administration decision to spend the last aid money on long-term
truck and air delivery contracts, anticipating that a House-drafted
``humanitarian'' aid package would be approved. Instead, the
package was voted down on March 3.
   After the White House session, House Speaker Jim Wright said
Reagan's plea for a renewal of aid puzzled him.
   ``It doesn't really seem to make total sense,'' Wright, D-Texas,
said.
   He said it was House Republicans, acting in concert with Reagan,
who defeated a $30 million package of food and clothing for the
rebels two weeks ago, just after their U.S. aid pipeline had run
dry.
   He expressed ``amazement'' that Reagan would cheer the defeat of
that package, then two weeks later come to Congress with an urgent
request for new supplies. ``I can't conceive of it,'' Wright said.
   Wright quoted Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell,
as telling congressional leaders that ``virtually all aspects'' of
the Contra effort are ``in crisis and on the verge of collapse,
that food for the Contra families will run out the first of April.
The program is drying up and dying before our very eyes.''
   In December, 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded
Sandinista soldiers who mounted an incursion into Honduras to
attack Contra bases. On that occasion, U.S. Army helicopters were
brought in to ferry Honduran infantrymen to the front.
   At that time, Honduras charged that 800 to 2,500 Sandinista
soldiers crossed the border and penetrated up to nine miles into
Honduras before returning to Nicaragua about a week later.
   Since U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29 and the House voted
narrowly on March 3 against a new ``humanitarian'' aid package, the
Contras have fallen back toward border areas to defend supply
caches, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said. That means
``they cannot use normal guerrilla tactics to disperse and escape
superior Sandinista firepower and manpower being brought to bear on
them,'' he said.
   Wright said he did not know the extent of any Sandinista
preparations, but said he has ``earnestly implored'' the Managua
government to act in good faith. He said his message for the
Sandinistas was: ``You are in a position of strength. Do not abuse
that strength.''
   Democratic House leaders said they had offered to revive the $30
million ``humanitarian'' aid proposal they had offered on March 3,
but got no immediate response from White House officials. They said
if they were to revive the package, it would be only with the
guaranteed backing of GOP members who opposed it the last time
around.
   But Wright appeared unwilling to budge on the central issue of
whether any aid package would include the right for the president,
under certain conditions, to ask for and get a quick, guaranteed
congressional vote on additional military aid for the rebels.
   ``The bottom line is ... members are not willing to vote for
another expedited procedure,'' as the guaranteed vote is called, he
said.

   Sen. Paul Simon cashed in on home-state
loyalties in the Illinois Democratic presidential primary and won
support even from voters who doubt he can win the nomination or the
presidency, exit polls said Tuesday.
   Jesse Jackson, another Illinois resident, again won overwhelming
support from black voters, and increased his share of the white
vote to about 8 percent, three percentage points better than he did
in Illinois in 1984, polls said.
   ``The way I'm looking at the numbers, hometown boys do good,''
said Doug Muzzio, an ABC News poll analyst.
   Among Republicans, Vice President George Bush defeated Sen. Bob
Dole among virtually all ideological and demographic groups. Dole
kept pace with Bush only among independents who voted in the GOP
primary.
   Bush once again defeated former television evangelist Pat
Robertson even among his most likely supporters, born-again
Christians and those concerned with moral values, ABC, NBC News and
CBS News-New York Times polls said.
   Overwhelmingly, supporters of Jackson and of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis said their candidate had the best chance to win in
November, ABC said. But only 40 percent of Simon's supporters gave
him the best chance, and 35 percent named Dukakis even though they
voted for Simon.
   ``Simon's voters don't think he has the best chance in November
but they're voting for him anyway,'' said Muzzio. ``His vote seems
to be a home-state favorite vote.''
   Similarly, NBC News found that 80 percent of Dukakis' supporters
and 60 percent of Jackson's thought their man would win the
nomination, while only 35 percent of Simon's voters thought he
would be nominated. More Simon voters _ 39 percent _ thought
Dukakis eventually would win the nomination.
   ``Simon is a true favorite-son type candidate,'' said Sheldon
Gawiser, an NBC poll analyst. ``He has a 67 percent favorable
opinion rating. They think he's doing a good job as senator.''
   Though Dukakis finished third in the voting, ABC said a
plurality of Democrats, 35 percent, thought he was the Democrat
most likely to win the general election in November. Next was
Jackson with 27 percent; Simon had 18 percent and 12 percent
selected Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who is not a candidate but
has refused to rule out a convention draft.
   About a quarter of the electorate was black, and Jackson won 91
percent of the black vote, 20 points better than in 1984, ABC said.
   Jackson improved his showing among whites, but less so, winning
8 percent compared to 5 percent in 1984, Muzzio said. The racial
division was so dramatic, said Gawiser, ``There are two
electorates: black and white.''
   The groups had somewhat different concerns. The CBS News-New
York Times poll found that 53 percent of blacks cited unemployment
as one of their two greatest concerns and 45 percent cited poverty.
Unemployment also led among white concerns, at 39 percent;
protecting Social Security was second, cited by 29 percent.
   In the Republican vote, the CBS-Times poll said 70 percent of
the voters had selected their candidate before Super Tuesday, when
Bush won 16 of 17 states. The polls again indicated that good will
toward President Reagan had translated into support for the vice
president.
   NBC said 27 percent of the Republican voters said they were
born-again Protestants, and 54 percent voted for Bush, to 27
percent for Dole and 17 percent for Robertson. ABC said 17 percent
were white born-again Christians; Bush got 37 percent, Dole 35,
Robertson 26 percent.
   ``Robertson is not doing well among his core constituency, and
he's not moving beyond it,'' Muzzio said.
   The CBS-Times poll said 21 percent of the Republican voters
cited traditional moral values as one of their chief concerns, and
Bush won that group with 43 percent, to 29 percent for Robertson
and 25 percent for Dole.
   ``It's a very broad Bush victory,'' said Gawiser. ``He's solid
across the board.''
   The surveys were conducted by interviewing a random sample of
voters as they left their polling places. The margin of sampling
error for the results was about 5 points.

   A radio journalist was suspended Tuesday
for breaking broadcast laws by interviewing a sympathizer of the
Irish Republican Army, considered a ``subversive group.''
   Ireland's state-run RTE broadcasting network took Jenny McGeever
off the air by after the broadcast of her interview with Martin
McGuinness.
   McGuinness, a vice president of the IRA's political arm Sinn
Fein, commented on the return of the bodies of three IRA members
killed in Gibraltar while on an alleged bombing mission.
   Her suspension followed an Irish government request for an
investigation of the broadcast.
   The Irish Broadcasting Act prohibits interviews with or comments
from subversive groups.
   These include the IRA and its splinter group, the Irish National
Liberation Army, which are both outlawed; Sinn Fein, which is
legal, and Northern Ireland paramilitary groups.

<TEXT>
   Aiming for a third straight victory as the
1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race neared its end, Susan
Butcher left this Eskimo village Tuesday with Martin Buser just two
hours behind her.
   On the trail to Koyuk, Butcher and her 11-dog team overcame a
one-hour deficit, passing Buser and building a lead of five hours
by the time she reached this village, 171 miles from the finish
line in Nome. Butcher rested and fed her weary dogs for more than
five hours, leaving at 7:43 a.m.
   Buser, of Big Lake, made up time by cutting his stay in Koyuk
short. With 12 of his 20 original dogs still in harness, he
followed Butcher out at 9:55 a.m.
   Subzero temperatures and biting winds still hindered the
leaders, and forecasters said the wind chill factor could sink to
minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles into Nome.
   The winner is expected to cross the finish line at midmorning
Wednesday.
   Butcher, of Manley, has won the last two Iditarods, each time
proving the strength and endurance of her team in the final,
windswept miles along the barren Bering Sea coast. She set a course
record with each victory, last year burning up the trail in 11
days, 2 hours.
   Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion Rick
Swenson, who waged a neck-and-neck race with Butcher until his dogs
staged a sit-down strike just 22 miles from the finish.
   This year, Swenson, of Two Rivers, about six hours behind
Butcher at last report, leaving Koyuk at 2 p.m. in third place.
Running in fourth was Joe Garnie of Teller, who arrived in Koyuk at
11:49 a.m.
   Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref was fifth. Seventy-year-old Joe
Redington of Knik, credited with organizing the race but never a
winner, was running sixth. He had captured an early-race lead and
held onto it for more than 400 miles before falling back.
   The 16th annual race started March 5 in Anchorage. The first
musher to Nome will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next
19 finishers will split the rest. Finishers have to have at least
five dogs in harness at the end of the race in order to qualify.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

   Nicaraguan troops launched a major
offensive Tuesday against U.S.-supported rebel forces in northern
Nicaragua, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
   Leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, claimed Sandinista
troops entered Honduran territory. The Sandinistas denied the claim
and a Honduran military spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, said he had received no reports of incursions into his
country's territory.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said ``the army has undertaken major offensive
operations ... reports that the army has penetrated Honduras are
not true.''
   ``The army is developing a major military offensive at this
moment. We will inform you in due time,'' he added.
   Contra spokesmen in Washington and Miami claimed that Sandinista
troops had crossed into neighboring Honduran territory in pursuit
of rebel forces, who have secret base camps across the border.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a spokesman for the Honduran armed
forces, said he had no reports of Sandinista incursions.
   ``Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able to report on
the situation (along the border),'' he said
   A Honduran government source, who spoke with the condition he
not be identified, said President Jose Azcona Hoyo was watching the
situation closely and a government team ``is monitoring reports on
the subject.''
   In a speech to celebrate Women's Day, President Daniel Ortega
said on March 8 that ``the Sandinista army is on combat alert'' but
gave no details at the time.
   Ortega at the time said the combat alert was in response to the
Contras' refusal to join the Sandinistas in cease-fire talks they
had planned beginning March 9 in the small southern Nicaraguan town
of Sapoa.
   Ortega said his government had information the rebels were
planning to attack the Sandinista army ``at border points on the
Honduran frontier.''
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez confirmed to reporters Monday that
the Sandinista army was engaged ``in actions of a certain size'' in
different points in the country, but did not specify what locations
were involved.
   The Contras' clandestine Liberation Radio claimed Tuesday there
was heavy fighting for the past week in the northern 5th Military
Region that includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and Zelaya
South provinces.
   Sandinista military sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said about 6,000 government troops were involved in what
they called ``an important anti-insurgent operation.''
   Contra radio claimed the Sandinista army was carrying out
``genocidal bombardments'' in Chontales province, dropping 500- and
1,000-pound bombs from helicopters.
   ``Many peasants had to flee for fear of being torn to pieces,''
the radio said.
   Sandinista military sources in Juigalpa, capital of Chontales
province, told The Associated Press on Tuesday the Sandinista army
was using ``various military means, including helicopters'' to
dislodge Contra rebels who had been dominating the region for
months.
   Sandinista and Contra leaders had agreed to hold cease-fire
talks, for the first time inside Nicaraguan territory, at Sapoa
March 21-23. The offensive appeared to be an effort by the
Sandinista regime to start negotiating from a position of strength.
   Other military sources in Managua, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the Sandinista army ``unleashed a great
offensive in the northern part of the country,'' but the Defense
Ministry issued no reports.
   Up until Tuesday afternoon, the ministry and military sources
limited themselves to issuing ``routine'' news bulletins and other
reports to keep the offensive a secret, the sources said.
   In Washington, Contra leaders said Nicaraguan forces were
knocking the Contras back.
   ``They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said Ernesto
Palazio, director of the Contras' Washington office.
   Sandinista sources said the army sent reinforcements to
Chontales province, where fighting appeared to be heaviest, and
government troops were using helicopters and heavy artillery
against the rebels.
   Defense Ministry reports Tuesday said two rebels were killed
Monday near Rio Blanco, a town in northern Matagalpa province,
where a civilian was also killed by the Contras. They said two
other rebels were shot dead near the town of Pancasan.
   An additional 31 Contras were killed in scattered fighting in
Chontales, Rio San Juan and the southeastern province of Zelaya
South since Friday, the reports said. They said a rebel ambush
killed seven Sandinista soldiers and wounded eight near the Zelaya
South town of Nueva Guinea.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Senate Approves Revised Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By a wide margin, the Massachusetts Senate on
Tuesday approved a revised version of a universal health care bill
championed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to launch the state on an
experiment in ``health care for all.''
   Dukakis has touted the proposal in his Democratic presidential
campaign as a model for the nation.
   The Senate endorsed the measure 23-11, sending the bill to a
House-Senate conference committee to iron out differences with a
House version that would exempt many small businesses and shower
favors on certain hospitals.
   Sen. Patricia McGovern, the Senate Ways and Means chairwoman and
the chief architect of the Senate bill, said she was confident a
compromise could be worked out swiftly.
   There are an estimated 600,000 uninsured residents in the state,
more than half of them working people whose employers don't provide
health benefits. Among other things, the bill would provide
incentives for businesses to offer their own health insurance.
   Senate supporters fought off repeated challenges throughout the
day. In a key test, a Republican effort to strip the huge health
care bill of provisions guaranteeing health care protection to all
Massachusetts residents by 1992 was defeated by a 27-9 vote.
   Senate Minority Leader John Parker, who championed the
amendment, tried again later, offering an amendment to match the
House language and exempt all businesses with nine or fewer
employees. That amendment fell short on a vote of 17-19.
   The exemption, included in the House measure, has been
criticized as leaving the entire program open to a challenge on the
grounds that it makes the benefits mandatory for some employees and
not others.
   The universal health care proposal has been tied to a bill
renewing the state's hospital financing law, providing nearly $1
billion in revenue increases for the state's 106 acute-care
hospitals over the next four years.
   The House passed the health care bill two weeks ago, with a
maximum price tag for the state of about $1 billion over four years
to provide insurance coverage for uninsured and incentives to
business to offer the benefit to employees.
   The Senate has estimated the state's cost at about $540 million
over the same period.

<HEAD>Aquino Says She Is Ready For New Talks With Moslem Insurgents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said
Wednesday she was prepared for new talks with Moslem insurgents as
her government sought to head off a bid by the rebels for
international Islamic support.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she was willing to talk with the Moro
National Liberation Front and ``all Moslem leaders of Mindanao,''
the country's second largest island and stronghold of the 5-million
member Moslem community.
   On Tuesday, Zain Jali, a religious adviser to the liberation
front, told reporters that his group would resume peace talks but
threatened to establish a government-in-exile if the Aquino
administration did not agree to negotiations by next week.
   The front, largest of three Moslem rebel groups, is expected to
seek full membership in the Organization of Islamic Conference when
ministers of the worldwide Moslem group meet next week in Amman,
Jordan.
   Filipino officials have said the move would be tantamount to
recognition of the front as a ``state within a state'' and full
membership could lead to civil war.
   The front has been waging a campaign for 16 years for self-rule,
but the rebellion has been largely limited to small-scale ambushes
and raids. The revolt peaked in the mid-1970s after claiming more
than 50,000 lives.
   Before Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Mrs. Aquino said she had
received no formal request from the front for new talks.
Negotiations broke down last May because of differences over the
conditions and scope of self-rule.
   A former front official, Zacaria Candao, left Tuesday for Saudi
Arabia for talks with other rebel leaders. Candao, governor of
Maguindanao province, said he would seek a meeting with
Secretary-General Shariffudin Pirzada of the Islamic organization
to discourage full front membership in the organization.
   Meanwhile, a rival Moslem rebel group announced it also was
seeking full membership in the Islamic group. Officials of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front told reporters in Mindanao that their
organization was more stable than the Moro National Liberation
Front.
   Last April, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front organized a series
of attacks across central Mindanao to protest the decision of the
government to hold talks only with the Moro National Liberation
Front.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis tried to put the best face on a
third-place finish in the Illinois Democratic primary Tuesday
night, saying ``it's not a setback because we ran against two
favorite sons.''
   After numerous questions about whether his showing in Illinois
was a disappointment, the Massachusetts governor was making no
predictions about the next big contest, the Michigan Democratic
caucuses on March 26.
   ``I don't believe we have any front-runners, I don't think we're
going to have a front-runner until the convention,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he didn't think the Illinois results increased the
chances of a brokered convention.
   ``I've been making a number of calls around the country to key
Democrats, and there is an overwhelming sentiment that we should
get behind a nominee,'' he said.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson took first and second
respectively in the Illinois primary, leaving Dukakis third in the
popular vote.
   ``It's not a setback, because we ran against two favorite sons
who started off with a lead and stayed there,'' Dukakis said. ``We
did what I can characterize was a respectable third.''
   The seven days between Super Tuesday and the Illinois primary
left Dukakis too little time to attract strong support in Illinois,
the Massachusetts governor said at a news conference at a local
television station. Dukakis spent $246,000 in media advertising in
Illinois.
   During the Illinois campaign, Dukakis had said a vote for Simon
would increase the chances of a brokered Democratic National
Convention, something he said would be a ``disaster.''
   But Tuesday night, Dukakis said he had spent the days on the
telephone with congressmen, senators and other leading Democrats,
and most told him they favored a decision by the voters, not by
convention negotiators.
   Dukakis' demeanor was in marked contrast to his gala celebration
the night of Super Tuesday, when he won the most delegates and the
most states.
   Smiling tightly, Dukakis said with apparent relief: ``Now, we
move on to Michigan, where there are no favorite sons. The field is
wide open.''

   The Reagan administration is looking at ways
that Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega might be allowed
to leave Panama for a third country without having to face
extradition to the United States on drug charges.
   Some officials see that as a key to encouraging a quick
departure by Noriega, whom the United States is trying to force out
of Panama.
   There were a number of signs Monday that the administration was
reassessing its position but it was not clear whether the
withdrawal of federal drug smuggling indictments against Noriega
was among the options.

   America's urban schools are in deep trouble,
beset by problems ranging from low morale and high dropout rates to
dilapidated facilities and crippling bureaucratic regulations, the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said today.
   The foundation called for a ``crusade on behalf of urban
education'' including greater financial support for inner-city
schools and more freedom and accountability for teachers and
principals.
   In a 38-page report called, ``An Imperiled Generation: Saving
Urban Schools,'' the Carnegie trustees said: ``Many people have
simply written off city schools as little more than human

   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk wants to head
off a bruising battle for the party's presidential nomination and
would mediate efforts to close ranks behind a probable nominee if
nobody finishes the primaries with enough delegates to win.
   ``When you get to a point when there is someone who is somewhat
shy of a mathematical majority, I think the opportunity exists to
try to strengthen that person and not weaken him as you come into
the convention,'' Kirk said Monday.
   The delegates who could tip the balance for such a candidate are
the 645 so-called ``super delegates,'' the party leaders, members
of Congress and governors of states and territories who
automatically will be convention delegates because of the offices
they hold. Four years ago, 568 convention seats were used for this
purpose.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev named March 15 as the date a
peace package should be signed by Soviet-backed Afghanistan and
Pakistan, which represents Afghan guerrilla groups, if Moscow was

   Both sides have hinted they do not consider the date a binding

Bob Dole insisted there was a turning point out there, a state
where voters would say, ``Wait a minute, we don't want George
Bush.'' But Dole's campaign was hard-pressed to identify that
turnaround state.
   It wasn't likely to happen in Connecticut, one of the states
Bush calls home. And the Republican presidential polls don't look
promising for Dole in Wisconsin, New York or Pennsylvania.

the atmosphere and burn up if it weren't recaptured in time.
   The new schedule makes no change in the date of the much-delayed
first post-Challenger flight, now set for Aug. 4. There have been

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987 as America
fell deeper into debt to the rest of the world, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
   The deficit in the U.S. current account was 13.7 percent higher
than the 1986 deficit of $141.4 billion and marked the fifth
consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record.
   The Reagan administration has sought to downplay the
significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend
that the rapid buildup of foreign debt could eventually topple the
country into another recession, triggered by a plunge in the value
of the dollar.

<HEAD>Getting the Down Payment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Once a young couple obtains the down payment for
a house, the cost of operating it may be no more than might be
needed for rent and maintenance of an apartment.
   Moreover, the benefits of homeownership are great.
   Owners become member of the elite tax-privileged class, since
mortgage interest and real estate taxes are deductions on federal
income tax returns. They build equity. And their house is a good
hedge against inflation.
   It is for such reasons, and several more, that suggestions are
now pouring into Congress on ways to help young folks get a
financial foot in the door of their own house. What they seek, in
effect, is government sponsorship.
   This wouldn't be the first time that government provided such
assistance, of course, but in recent years it has indicated a
desire to reduce, not add to, its programs. But, say proponents of
aid, there are special factors today.
   Indeed there are.
   First on the list is the down payment. Housing prices have risen
sharply in recent years, far outperforming the after-tax paychecks
of young workers. As a consequence, ownership is down.
   Between World War II and 1980 the ownership rate rose without
significant interruption, reaching 65.6 percent in 1980. But then
it began receding again, settling at 63.8 percent in 1986.
   Even more disturbing, according to the National Association of
Realtors, the rate for people under age 25 and for those in the
prime homebuying ages of 25 to 43, fell more steeply. For the
former, the rate dropped to 21.6 percent from 26.4 percent; for the
latter, the drop was to 45.4 percent from 55 percent.
   These figures have become the cue for proponents of government
assistance, and the Realtors are among the most insistent, as
witness the statement by Nestor Weigand Jr., Realtor president,
that ``it is time for the federal government to recognize that
homeownerhip is beneficial to everyone.''
   ``Everyone'' includes lumber suppliers, plumbers, carpenters,
roofers, appliance and carpet manufacturers, real estate agents,
lawyers and many other folks besides the young couples seeking a
home of their own.
   Their efforts, especially when coordinated, can mean formidable
pressure for another housing program, even in the face of
opposition from those, such as the White House, that would like
government out of private-sector matters.
   Out of this self-interest _ which isn't to deny an element of
true public concern _ some creative, though not especially new,
proposals have emerged, such as these from the Realtors:
   _A program to enable first-time homebuyers to withdraw without
penalty a certain amount from their Individual Retirement Accounts
or other tax-deferred savings to be used only for a down payment.
   _Establishment of an Individual Housing Account, the money from
which would mean eligibility for an income tax credit if used as a
down payment.
   _Creation of a National Employee Homeownership Program to allow
employers to provide down payment assistance to employees, with tax
advantages to both.
   But just as creative is a strictly private-sector plan that also
might be considered. It is simple, informal, responsible, familial
and probably beneficial not just to the individuals involved but
for all society, too.
   Proponents of this plan observe that many homeowner parents have
built up tremendous equity, in part because of the sharp rise in
prices that denies their children the opportunity for a home of
their own.
   Many of these parents are at peak earning power, simultaneous
with a reduction in their expenses. Couldn't they tap some of that
equity in order to lend a down payment to their children? Don't
they owe it to their offspring?
   A main feature of the plan, say its proponents, is its
non-bureaucratic nature. The only way Uncle Sam gets into the act
is to allow a tax deduction to the parents who borrow the money.

<HEAD>Unusual Religious Alliance Formed On Middle East Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an explosive time about a tense issue _
Israel's dealings with Palestinians _ a highly unusual American
religious alliance has been formed to press for solutions to the
crisis.
   Moslem, Jewish and Christian leaders are included in the new
U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in the Middle East.
   What made possible the unlikely combination on the keenly
divisive problem was that ``it was an idea whose time had come,''
says Ronald J. Young, executive director of the organization.
   It couldn't have happened, he adds, ``unless the time was ripe
for it.''
   In any case, prominent U.S. Jews and Moslems, who have been on
opposing sides in Middle East conflict, along with top Protestant
and Roman Catholic officials, are extensively involved in the
common effort.
   About 600 religious leaders are initial backers, with other
being enlisted, to work for a ``moral climate'' that would spur
politicians to take initiatives regarded necessary for Middle
Eastern peace.
   Seeking to set forth a middle ground in the conflict, which has
particularly divided Jews and Moslems, the committee's joint
statement affirms these principles:
   _ Support of Israel's right to secure borders, and also of U.N.
resolution 242 calling for Israel's withdrawal from the now
violence-racked West Bank and Gaza taken in the 1967 war, and
security of all states in the region.
   _ The Palestinian people's right to self-determination and to
choose their own leadership.
   _ The urgency of an international conference for peace involving
all parties in the conflict, as well as members of the U.N.
security council, including the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   ``The Reagan administration has been reluctant about taking
these positions,'' Young said in an interview. ``It has given a
higher priority to keeping the Russians out, and this has not been
helpful.''
   He also said that the U.S. administration also has not
explicitly supported the Palestinians' right to self-determination,
although such a right ``has a history that started in this
country.''
   Young said discussions about a joint approach by American
Christians, Jews and Moslems started last June, before the outbreak
of riots in Gaza and the West Bank, but events there gave the cause
increased urgency.
   They ``dramatically demonstrate that the current situation is
disastrous for the Palestinians and, in the long run, will be
disastrous for Israel as well,'' he said.
   He said local units of the new organization have formed in St.
Louis, Kansas City, Portland, Ore., and Syracuse, N. Y., and are
being planned in 11 other cities _ Atlanta, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, New York and Washington, D.C.
   He said the aim is to build up a national mood of Jews, Moslems
and Christians that would encourage political leaders to act on the
problem.
   ``In dealing with the Middle East, we are dealing not just with
the complexities of the particular situation, but with the whole
history of prejudice against Jews and also against Arabs and
Moslems,'' Young said.
   As a result, he said, ``they have a strong fear against trusting
anyone else with the welfare of their people. There also is a great
deal of insensitivity among Christians about how deep those fears
are.''
   The alliance maintains it is urgent that the U.S. make Middle
Eastern peace a priority of foreign policy.
   Among backers listed of the new effort:
   Moslem _ Dawud Assad, president of the Council of Mosques, and
Fahd M. Al-Nassar, president of the Moslem World League, both of
New York; Iman W. Deen Muhammad of Chicago, and Cherif Sedky, an
American-Arab attorney of Washington, D.C.
   Jewish _ Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations; its senior vice president, Albert
Vorspan; Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, executive of the Rabbinical Assembly;
Rabbi Eugene Lipman, present of the Central Conference of American
Rabbis, and Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Freedom of
Conscience Foundation.
   Christian _ Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angles; the Rev.
Theodore M. Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame; Eugene
Fisher, head of the U.S. Catholic bishops' committee on
Catholic-Jewish relations; Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos;
Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmund L. Browning; the Rev. Avery Post,
president of the United Church of Christ; the Rev. John Humbert,
president of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and United
Methodist Bishop George Bashore of Boston.
   Young, a quaker, formerly director of peace programs for the
American Friends Service Committe, said Jews and Moslems have
differed on Mid-East issues, but ``see effort for peace as not
contradicting their consistency.''
   He said:
   ``We are committed to challenging historic and persistent
prejudices against the Jewish people, Moslems and Arabs _
prejudices that inhibit the kind of cooperation for justice and
peace that clearly is a moral imperative of our common Abrahamic
faith.''

<HEAD>Renting, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic: Teens Using Videos for Homework</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   Fourteen-year-old Tiffany Salzer got an ``A'' on her book report
without opening the book. She watched the movie instead.
   ``It only took me three hours to watch the movie and it would
have taken me 12 hours to read the book,'' said the ninth-grader
from Ventura, Calif.
   Her father, Jim, owner of Salzer's Video Store and a board
member of the Video Softwares Dealers Association, is familiar with
the situation.
   ``It's a problem,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``A kid
essentially can rent a classic movie and do a book report from it.
Kids are taking shortcuts.''
   Videotape retailers across the nation say many teen-agers,
children of the television generation, are taking study guides that
summarize literature one step further and turning to videotapes for
help with homework, renting rather than reading.
   Tiffany said her teachers sometimes show movies in class, but
only after students presumably have read the corresponding
literature. She said she watched ``Clan of the Cave Bear'' the
night before a report on the book was due.
   ``The teachers say the movie is different. Sometimes it is, but
students don't really care,'' she said. ``It's better to get a `C'
than an `F.'''
   At parents' requests, Art Marra pulled ``To Kill A Mockingbird''
from the shelves at his HTO Video store in suburban Pittsburgh
after students were assigned to read the book.
   Since then, Marra periodically has refused to rent certain
videotapes to youths because he learned the corresponding books
were homework assignments.
   ``We're a community-oriented shop. We try to give the community
any cooperation we can,'' Marra said.
   Mike Petraglia noticed young people make sporadic runs on
certain films at his Video-O-Video store in Pittsburgh. He said a
popular videotape among teens is ``Dirty Dancing,'' but when
assignments dictate, he can't find enough copies of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' ``Treasure Island,'' ``Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Billy
Budd.''
   ```Gone With the Wind' has been picking up a little bit. I think
it's book-related,'' he said.
   Students always have searched for the easier way, and the video
scholar is just a variation of the Cliff Notes customer, said Scott
Treibitz, spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers, based
in Washington, D.C.
   For 29 years, students have used Cliff Notes to provide
summaries and analysis of books, and sales of the study guides
still are growing, said Doug Lincoln, spokesman for Cliff Notes
Inc. of Lincoln, Neb.
   ``The problem now is with the access of video cassette recorders
and with the access of video stores,'' Treibitz said.
   Lincoln said Cliff Notes may produce its own videotapes, but he
declined to discuss details.
   ``The generation that is in elementary school now, they're
certainly in the video age,'' Lincoln said. ``I would have to say
the (use) of video will probably only increase.''
   Teachers are increasingly using videotapes in the classroom, and
as a supplement the tapes are helpful, said Judi Boren, spokeswoman
for the North Allegheny County School District in suburban
Pittsburgh.
   ``You can't use the video as a Cliff Note kind of crutch,'' Ms.
Boren said. ``There's a saying, `I read the book. I don't need to
see the movie.' If you make some comparisons, maybe you need to do
both.''
   ``A teacher can give a lecture on the Grand Canyon, Niagara
Falls, space exploration,'' Treibitz said. ``A video not only gives
that same material, but shows the visuals to reinforce that
material.
   ``It can't replace reading, it can't replace writing and there
are times it can't replace the lecture,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: White House Creating New Group For Stock Market Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House plans to create a new group
that will make final, unified Reagan administration recommendations
on how to prevent another stock market collapse, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Tuesday editions that the
White House, whose Brady Commission task force already has made
such recommendations, is creating a new interagency committee to
develop a consolidated administration position in the next 60 to 90
days.
   The committee, which would be headed by Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III, would include top officials of the Federal Reserve,
Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the newspaper stated, quoting unidentified White House
aides.
   It was hoped the new committee, details of which still are being
worked out, would be able to smooth over conflicts among the
various regulatory agencies over how best to prevent another market
crash, the newspaper stated.
   Since the Brady Commission came out with its recommendations in
early January, federal regulators have been engaged in often-public
sniping over what regulatory changes should be made to prevent a
repeat of the Oct. 19 market debacle.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, for example, has indicated he
believed his agency should be chief regulator of stock index
futures traded in the commodity markets, a position vehemently
opposed by the CFTC.
   Congressional aides suggested that the White House might view
such divisiveness as weakening its influence over any legislative
response to the October crash.
   The Brady Commission, headed by former New Jersey senator
Nicholas Brady, essentially recommended a coordinated, intermarket
system of ``circuit breakers'' to prevent wild price swings; higher
margin requirements on stock index futures; unified clearing and
settlement operations in the stock and futures markets; and giving
the Fed superagency authority over key issues affecting the stock
and futures markets.
   The Times said details of the interagency committee were
contained in letters sent Friday by Senate Banking Committee
Chairman William Proxmire to White House chief of staff Howard H.
Baker Jr., and the chairmen of the Fed, SEC and CFTC. In those
letters, Proxmire referred to a conversation with Baker regarding
the committee.
   Proxmire indicated he was pleased with the idea, but also stated
that 90 days might be too long for Congress to wait for the new
group's recommendations, given that the agencies involved already
had conducted their own studies of the crash and made
recommendations.
   Proxmire also stated he planned to ask the Fed, SEC and CFTC top
submit their legislative proposals in time for a March 31 hearing
on the issue.

   The Commerce Department said Monday that inventories increased
by $3 billion in January, pushing the total of unsold items on
store shelves and backlots to a seasonally adjusted $705.85 billion.
   Analysts said the slowdown in the rate of increase was an

   Stock prices were little changed today in light,
lackluster trading.
   Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range as both
institutional and retail investors remained on the sidelines while
awaiting fresh economic news due out later in the week.
   The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise
trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first ``triple
witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock
indexes will expire simultaneously.
   While concern over the two events dampened activity in the
previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants
may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the
witching hour might have.
   Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade
figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the
past couple of witching hours have been rather uneventful with the
adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of
last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.

   Textile industry analysts say the bidding may
not be over for J.P. Stevens & Co., even though the company has
accepted a nearly $1 billion cash buyout offer from an investment
group.
   A group led by Odyssey Partners of New York announced Monday it
agreed to pay $61.50 in cash for each of Stevens' 15.5 million
shares outstanding, or about $953.24 million.
   The offer is subject to a majority of the shares being tendered
and the necessary financing being obtained.
   Analysts called Odyssey's bid fair, although some said they
thought the bidding could continue.
   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens' stock
jumped $5.37{ a share to close at $61.12{.
   Over the past few weeks, Stevens has fielded rival offers from
Atlanta-based West Point-Pepperell Inc. and a group led by its own
senior management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth
generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   The management group offered $55 a share in cash and securities
in a leveraged buyout about two weeks ago, up from its initial
offer of $43 a share. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired
largely with borrowed money repaid with a target company's profits
or the sales of assets.
   West Point-Pepperell, a major household fabrics maker with
brands that include Arrow, Martex and Lady Pepperell, offered to
buy Stevens for $56 a share in cash, or about $867 million. The
company confirmed Monday it had considered raising its offer to
$62.50 a share, but had not made a formal bid at the higher price.
   West Point-Pepperell refused to comment on what, if any, further
action it might take.
   ``The arbitragers think there could be more bidding,'' said
Edward Johnson, a textile analyst with Johnson Redbook, a division
of Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. ``A deal is never done until all
the stock is signed over.''
   George O. Zimmerman, an analyst with Gruntal & Co., said a
higher offer could torpedo the deal with Odyssey. ``I think they'll
have to take the highest bid,'' he said.
   Odyssey is a private investment company. Its deals have included
the purchase of a controlling interest in Lucky Stores Inc.'s Eagle
Food Stores, located in the Midwest, and a leveraged buyout of
Research Cottrell Inc., a pollution control, engineering and
construction company.
   Odyssey said it would finance the deal with a $600 million loan
from Citibank, $570 million from the sale subordinated debt and
preferred stock and $100 million in equity investment.
   Should the deal go through, Johnson predicted, Odyssey likely
could sell parts of Stevens to pay off its debt.
   Stevens already undertook a major restructuring about five years
ago, selling off some of its finished fabrics divisions to
concentrate more on home furnishings.
   New York-based Stevens, one of the nation's biggest textile
makers with 23,000 employees, produces home fashion textiles such
as sheets, towels and carpets under the brand names Ralph Lauren,
Laura Ashley and Pierre Cardin. The company also makes automotive
products and industrial products.
   The company had an after-tax profit of $56 million on sales of
$1.6 billion in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31.

<HEAD>Honda Motor Lacks Punch At Home, But Analysts See Good Potential
For Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Its victories in overseas markets have brought
Honda Motor Co. worldwide recognition, but the company still is
waging an uphill battle to become a dominant automaker in its own
backyard.
   In sharp contrast with Honda's success abroad _ it holds about
3.5 percent of the world auto market _ the company has had trouble
penetrating the Japanese market dominated by the ``Big Two'' of
Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., which together control
nearly a 50 percent share.
   In recent years, Honda's domestic sales have been growing, often
faster than the rate of Japan's overall motor-vehicle market
expansion.
   To boost growth further, the company will add new cars and
models to its product line and increase the number of Honda dealers
and salesmen each year into the 1990s, says Honda President Takashi
Kume.
   By 1991, Honda expects its domestic network to grow about 25
percent from now to 3,000 dealers and more than double the number
of salesmen to 18,000.
   New products will allow Honda to sell 800,000 cars and
mini-vehicles a year at home by 1991 and 1 million by the
mid-1990s, Kume says. These projections compare with last year's
sales of 546,979 units and this year's forecast of 620,000 vehicles.
   Honda's domestic market share rose to 9.1 percent in 1987 from
7.0 percent in 1986.
   But in a market where overall demand for cars, trucks and buses,
exceeded 6 million units for the first time last year, Honda still
lags far behind Toyota and Nissan.
   Analysts say Japanese culture and Honda's own history have
contributed to its domestic struggle.
   Honda _ originally a motorcycle manufacturer _ had a late start
in the auto business, entering the four-wheeled vehicle market in
1963 some 30 years after the Big Two. Analysts say this still
haunts the company: Honda's sales network of 2,400 dealers and
8,200 salespeople is dwarfed, for example, by Toyota's 4,000
dealers and 41,000 salespeople.
   Takamori Matsuda, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities
(Japan) Ltd., says Japan's ``unspoken dealer loyalty'' is a major
obstacle to Honda's expansion in the domestic market.
   ``Unlike the U.S. market, where car retailers are mostly
independent (from manufacturers) and often switch makers or brands
they handle, there is virtually no betrayal on the part of dealers
in this country,'' Matsuda said.
   Japanese automakers generally maintain high capital
participation in their dealers and thus enjoy more control over
them. That condition makes a switch, say, from Toyota to Honda,
virtually impossible, Matsuda said.
   Tetsuo Sakiya, author of the book ``Honda Motor: the Men, the
Management, the Machines'' and professor of international relations
at Musashino Womens College in Tokyo, contends Honda could have
closed the gap with the Big Two if company founder Shoichiro Honda
and his senior officials in the late 1960s had more foresight.
   Honda early on had decided to rely on an air-cooled engine and
missed out on the first full-fledged wave of Japanese motorization
in the late 1960s and the early 1970s because it did not have the
``right product,'' a car with a quieter and cleaner water-cooled
engine, Sakiya said.
   ``If Honda hadn't chosen an air-cooled engine, its standing
would've been a lot better against Toyota and Nissan today,''
Sakiya said.
   Honda introduced its 1300 model, a sedan powered by an
air-cooled engine, in 1969 but replaced it two years later with a
lightweight car, the Honda Life, with a much-acclaimed water-cooled
CVCC engine.
   A more conspicuous cause of Honda's weakness at home, and in
overseas markets to some extent, has been its lack of a full
product line and diversity in the styling and size of its cars,
according to analysts. Not until October 1985 did Honda, a thriving
maker of economical subcompacts, decide to pursue affluent
consumers with the Legend, a 2.7 liter-engine luxury car.
   Because of its relatively limited lineup of models in the over 2
liter engine class, Honda will not benefit as much as the Big Two
from the boom in the market for bigger, more powerful and more
expensive cars, analysts say.
   To expand its lineup further, Honda also recently re-entered the
minicar market and is scheduled to launch Japanese sales of a
version of the Accord series assembled at its facilities in
Marysville, Ohio. It is also widely rumored to be planning to
introduce a sports car powered by a six-cylinder or eight-cylinder
engine next year.
   Honda also is believed to be planning a line of luxury models by
the 1990s featuring a flagship sedan with a V-8 or V-12 engine.
   Matsuda says to compete domestically Honda also must deal with
Japanese upbringing that fosters more conformity and harmony among
individuals, compared with the U.S. system that stresses
individuality.
   ``It's easier to sell to Americans who aren't afraid of making
their own decisions and accepting the unknown, compared with
Japanese consumers who are often oversensitive to impressions they
make on others through the purchase of a product,'' Matsuda said.
``The upshot of this (Japanese) attitude is that people are driving
cars, often white, from the same familiar makers.''
   But analysts think Honda's potential for sustained growth at
home is strong. They concur that Honda is pulling ahead to emerge
as the definite winner in a three-way battle for the slot of
Japan's third biggest automaker with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
Mazda Motor Co.

   R.H Macy & Co. has raised the stakes in its
battle to acquire Federated Department Stores Inc., boosting its
proposed payout and locking up the option to purchase two prize
Federated divisions regardless of who wins control of the retailing
company.
   Macy on Monday sweetened its merger agreement with Federated by
$200 million in cash, raising the value of the offer to $6.3
billion and topping a rival, hostile $6.2 billion proposal by
Campeau Corp.
   Separately, a federal judge indicated he would not rule before
Wednesday in suits filed by Macy and Campeau in connection with
their war over Federated, but effectively extended Campeau's buyout
offer into next week.
   Macy _ whose own offer expires April 4 _ had sought to delay
expiration of Campeau's offer by 20 days to lessen the pressure on
Federated shareholders to accept the hostile bid.
   Toronto-based Campeau extended its offer through Friday from
today's original expiration, but stated Monday it had no immediate
intention to revise its bid in response to the sweetened offer from
Macy.
   Under terms of the amended merger agreement unanimously approved
by the Federated board, Macy will offer $77.35 a share in cash for
80 percent of Federated's stock, up from $74.50 per share in its
original offer.
   Macy plans to swap shares in the merged company and issue
convertible debt securities for the remaining 20 percent of
Federated shares.
   Federated stock closed unchanged at $66 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Federated also granted Macy the option to purchase its
Bullock's-Bullock's Wilshire and I. Magnin retail divisions if the
merger fell through. Such ``lockup'' options frequently are used to
discourage hostile suitors.
   Federated said the divisions would sell for at least $800
million and $150 million, respectively, although Campeau has valued
those divisions at a total of about $1.25 billion.
   Macy also granted Federated's board sole discretion over whether
to maintain its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan. Under its
previous agreement, Cincinnati-based Federated would have rescinded
the plan in a merger with Macy.
   Federated recommended its shareholders tender their stock to
Macy, calling the new offer ``substantially more favorable to
Federated stockholders than Macy's previous offer and the coercive
Campeau two-tier offer.''
   Campeau is offering to pay $75 cash a share for 70.5 million of
Federated's common shares outstanding, or 80 percent, through
Friday.
   The remaining 20 percent of Federated stock would be acquired
later for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the
deal an aggregate value of $68 per share.
   Shortly after Campeau extended its offer, Federated urged its
shareholders to hold onto their stock, reversing the unusual
recommendation it made Sunday for stockholders to tender their
shares to the hostile bidder.
   Federated is opposed to merging with Campeau, but the retailer
had intended to prevent its shareholders from having to accept the
lower, $44 price under the ``back end'' of Campeau's two-tier bid.
   At Monday night's hearing, U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand
indicated he would not rule before Wednesday either on Macy's
request to force Campeau to extend its tender offer past Friday or
on Campeau's challenge to Federated's ``poison pill'' takeover
defense.
   Sand said he was seeking an opinion from the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Macy's contention that Campeau's latest
tender offer, which was revised from a previous lower bid,
constituted a brand-new offer. If the judge sides with Macy,
Campeau would have to delay its offer _ and the date when it could
acquire tendered shares _ to give shareholders time to consider the
new bid.
   The judge said he would not get the SEC opinion before Wednesday
and would not rule on either issue before then.
   However, Sand stated both buyout offers would have to remain in
effect for at least three business days after he ruled on the
poison pill issue, effectively extending Campeau's offer through
next week.

<HEAD>Stock Has Jumped Since $5.7 Billion Damage Request In Kodak Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buoyed by prospects of a billion-dollar court
settlement in a 12-year-old patent infringement case and by
takeover speculation, Polaroid Corp.'s stock has soared on Wall
Street in recent weeks.
   The instant photography pioneer is seeking $5.7 billion in
damages from Eastman Kodak Co., which was found guilty in 1985 of
violating seven of 150 Polaroid patents when it entered the instant
camera business in 1976.
   After reviewing papers filed in U.S. District Court here last
month, analysts increased their estimates for a possible settlement
to above $1 billion from their initial $300 million to $500 million
range.
   ``After reading the documents, a number of people said that
Polaroid's case is stronger than we had expected,'' said Eugene
Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The companies are to meet Friday with Judge Rya Zobel and may
discuss setting a trial date on the damages issue.
   Analysts said the possibility of a large award has attracted
investors and also invited speculation that a corporate raider
might bid for the company in hopes of realizing a windfall on a big
settlement.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, was trading in the low $20s a
share until the damage request was disclosed Feb. 19. Since then
Polaroid has climbed, topping $36 a share at one point. Polaroid
rose 25 cents to $34 a share Monday in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   Purchasing patterns have been in small blocks, however, and no
individual buyer has notified the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it holds as much as 5 percent of the stock.
   Polaroid won't comment on stock activity, takeover rumors or a
settlement.
   ``We have indicated from the very beginning 12 years ago that we
were always open to an out-of-court settlement,'' spokesman Harry
Johnson said. ``Talking about such matters in the media has a
chilling effect on that possibility.''
   In court documents, Polaroid argues it is entitled to $3.2
billion in lost camera and film sales. The company is seeking $2.5
billion more for lost opportunities to develop and market new
products.
   Kodak, which was ordered out if its $200 million a year instant
camera business in January 1986, has dismissed the claim as
``ludicrous and ridiculously inflated.'' The Rochester, N.Y.-based
photo giant argues Polaroid is entitled to a reasonable royalty,
not lost profits.
   If Zobel finds Kodak guilty of willfully infringing on
Polaroid's patents, pre-tax damages can be tripled under federal
law, raising the potential maximum award to $11 billion.
   No one expects the settlement to be that large, but a $1 billion
award _ equal to about $10 a share _ would allow Polaroid to
diversify into fields such as information retrieval or conventional
photography.
   Along with the Polaroid brand name, the possibility that the
company could run better under new management is keeping takeover
interest high, analysts said.
   ``It has the characteristics of the type of company that could
be run to generate greater cash flow,'' Glazer said.
   Polaroid founder Edwin H. Land invented instant photography in
1947 and first marketed it in 1948. Polaroid held a monopoly for
almost 30 years until Kodak entered the field.
   Polaroid camera sales peaked at 7.5 million units in 1978 before
sinking to 3.4 million in 1984. Sales jumped to 4.4 million in 1986
after the company introduced the Spectra camera, with quality
closer to that of 35 millimeter prints, but fell by 16 percent last
year.
   Polaroid had entered the 1970s with high expectations due to
technology for its SX-70 camera, which produced fast, dry color
prints. But Polaroid never was able to bring the cost of film down
enough, which hurt instant photography sales.
   Analysts said Polaroid could get a boost next month with the
introduction of the Spectra 600, priced at $40 to $60, and the
Image, which promises better quality for $60 to $80.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies in Narrow Range; Gold Mixed</HEAD>

   The dollar gained against most major currencies in
early European trading today.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the dollar was trading quietly in a narrow range as
market participants awaited Thursday's report of the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit for January.
   The British pound, which soared 10 cents against the dollar in a
month, slipped back ahead of the presentation to Parliament this
afternoon of the Conservative government's annual spring budget.
   Dealers in Europe said they were waiting to see whether the
budget delivered expected tax cuts and led to lower interest rates.
An interest rate cut would rein in the pound.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in Europe, the
dollar rose 0.02 yen to a closing 127.25. Later in London, the
dollar was quoted at 127.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6660 West German marks, up from 1.6645; 1.3760
Swiss francs, up from 1.3693; 5.6585 French francs, up from 5.6375;
1.8717 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8645; 1,232.70 Italian lire, up
from 1,227.87; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2577.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8510, compared
with $1.8575 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $440.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $441.00. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$442.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $442.25, up from $441.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.54 to close at a bid $443.27.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $6.22.

   Stock prices rebounded today, while the dollar
remained nearly unchanged against the Japanese yen as traders in
Tokyo awaited figures on the U.S. trade deficit for January.
   The dollar dipped at one point to 126.80 yen, but closed at
127.25 yen, up 0.02 yen from Monday's close. Its high for the day
was 127.30 yen.
   On the previous two trading days, the dollar lost a total of
0.97 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which dropped by 110.22 points on Monday,
continued to fall during today's morning session, but rebounded and
closed the day at 25,475.67 points, up 42.16 points, or 0.16
percent, from Monday's close. Volume was estimated at 1.7 billion
shares in the first section.
   ``Trading was active, but there weren't any real factors worth
commenting on,'' said an analyst with a major brokerage. ``The
market is gradually progressing toward its precrash levels and we
are seeing a general consolidation,'' said the analyst, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Traders said steels and heavy industrials led the afternoon
surge.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, also
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Tokyo market ``seems
to remain relatively calm'' until the release on Thursday of U.S.
trade figures for January.
   At a meeting of the House of Councillor's Budget Committee
today, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa predicted: ``The dollar
will appreciate against the yen in the future, rather than
stabilize.''

   Stock prices moved higher Tuesday morning on
optimism about Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget
statement for fiscal 1989, due later in the day.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 19.2
points, or 1 percent, at 1,838.7 at midday.
   Volume was a moderate 241.3 million shares at midday, up from
176.3 million shares at the same time a day earlier.
   Prices advanced gradually through the morning because of
optimism about the contents of Lawson's budget statement, dealers
said.
   In addition to tax rate cuts, investors were expecting Lawson to
outline financial targets which might provide a further boost for
the pound, dealers said. That might force the government to cut
British base lending rates in order to stabilize the currency, they
added.
   But some analysts discounted the idea because of concern that an
interest rate cut would boost inflation.
   ``The idea of a base rate cut seems to be gaining credibility in
the market,'' said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg
Securities. ``But we still don't think it's very likely.''

<HEAD>Firestone Board Seeking Alternatives To Pirelli; Bridgestone Deal
Shaky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. says the Pirelli
Group's unsolicited $1.8 billion takeover offer will likely force
it to abandon a previous agreement to sell most of its tire
operations to Bridgestone Corp. of Japan.
   But Firestone said its board of directors has authorized
management to explore alternatives to the Pirelli bid that possibly
could include a new deal with Bridgestone.
   Firestone said Monday that its board met to consider Pirelli's
$58-a-share tender offer but took no action.
   The company said that in light of Pirelli's offer it was
unlikely to consummate the joint venture agreement it announced
with the Japanese tiremaker on Feb. 16. Under that agreement,
Bridgestone would pay about $1.25 billion to buy 75 percent of
Firestone's tire operations.
   Pirelli's offer is contingent on Firestone dropping its plans to
enter the joint venture with Bridgestone.
   Firestone said that in seeking alternatives to the Pirelli
offer, its advisers had begun discussions with Bridgestone. The
board indicated it would meet again this week to complete its
review of Pirelli's offer.
   The board also reiterated its stance that shareholders should
not tender their shares until it issued its recommendation.
Firestone had stated previously the board would make its
recommendation by Friday.
   Firestone stock dipped 87{ cents to $61.62{ a share in active
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Earlier, a federal court in Cleveland heard arguments over
Pirelli's lawsuit attempting to declare Ohio's anti-takeover law
unconstitutional.
   Pirelli is seeking a temporary restraining order to keep the
Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act from affecting its bid for
Firestone. The act requires a hostile bidder to wait up to 50 days
for shareholders to vote before he can acquire tendered shares.
   A lawsuit challenging the law was filed last week by Veere Inc.,
a holding company owned by Pirelli that is incorporated in Delaware.
   Dennis Orr, an attorney for Veere, said the law is a burden on
interstate commerce and could hurt shareholders by giving Firestone
time to defeat Pirelli's tender offer, launched a week ago.
   Firestone attorney Patrick F. McCartan countered Orr's argument
by saying, ``Control is one of the most valuable assets a
shareholder can possess. It is a collective asset and should be
(given up) in a collective manner.''
   U.S. District Judge Alice Batchelder did not issue a ruling on
the temporary restraining order Monday.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. lost $164
million, more than previously estimated.
   Prudential Insurance Co. of America, the securities firm's
parent, said Monday its own profit from operations, before
dividends and federal income tax, rose to $2.65 billion from $2.55
billion. Prudential did not announce a net income figure.
   Prudential, the nation's largest insurer, did not detail the
reasons for the loss at Prudential-Bache except to say it included
a charge of $47 million from the closing of an international trade
unit.
   Prudential-Bache told its employees in January it had taken an
unspecified charge related to litigation involving the alleged
attempt by the Hunt brothers of Texas to corner the silver market
in early 1980.
   The securities subsidiary also said it had taken substantial
charges hiring investment bankers and had losses in the October
stock market crash and its aftermath.

   Atari Corp. of Sunnyvale has charged
Micron Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho, with illegally exploiting a
shortage of computer memory chips.
   The computer and video company on Monday filed suit in U.S.
District Court, seeking an order to make the Idaho semiconductor
manufacturer pay the California company an unspecified amount of
damages. The suit charges breach of contract, bad faith and
violation of federal antitrust law.
   There was no immediate response from Micron Technology.
   Micron Technology is one of only two U.S.-based companies that
make the most common kind of computer memory chip, known as dynamic
random access memory chips, or D-RAMs. The other is Texas
Instruments Inc. of Dallas.
   The shortage of the chips has been caused by strong sales of
personal computers, the changeover to a new generation of chips,
and a 1986 accord between the United States and Japan aimed at
ending Japanese ``dumping'' of the chips at unfairly low prices.

   South Korea plans to sharply cut its
tariffs on imports during the next five years as part of its
efforts to boost foreign sales here, government officials said
Tuesday.
   Officials at the Ministry of Finance said a plan under study
calls for the country's average import tariffs of 16.9 percent to
be cut by half by 1993.
   Details of the plan would be completed by June, the officials
said.
   The plan, they added, is aimed at stimulating imports, thereby
cutting South Korea's growing current account surplus, which
reached $10 billion last year. The imbalance has led to complaints
from trading partners.

   The stock market was little changed today in
early, quiet trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.16 point to
2,050.23 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 678 up, 380 down and
499 unchanged just before 10 a.m.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19,050,000 million shares.
   Analysts said the market continued to fluctuate in a narrow
range absent of any major news. ``There is a theme here that the
economy is okay,'' said Larry Wachtel, first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Co.
   He predicted continued but restrained gains ahead of the
government's report Thursday on the nation's trade balance for
January.
   This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly
``triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.
   Firestone rose | to 62\. The company said it doesn't expect to
complete the sale of its tire operations to Bridgestone because of
an unsolicited tender offer from Pirelli of Italy.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
unchanged at 150.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 0.35 at 297.29.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.09 to
2,050.07.
   Takeover news and speculation and a late flurry of buying in
blue chips provided the highlights of an otherwise uninspired
session.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 737 up, 794 down and 445 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 131.89 million shares, down from 200.02
million in the previous session, and the lightest total since a
111.58 million-share day Dec. 29.

<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. foreign trade surged
13.7 percent last year to a record $160.7 billion, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the current account deficit grew
from the previous record of $141.4 billion in 1986 even though the
deficit for the final three months of the year narrowed slightly.
   The current account covers not only the flow of merchandise
across the U.S. border but also the flow of services, primarily
investment earnings between countries.
   While the United States has run deficits in merchandise trade
for 16 of the past 17 years, the current account was in surplus as
recently as 1981 as Americans' earnings on overseas investments
were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.
   On Monday the Commerce Department reported a 0.4 percent rise in
January business inventories, less than half the December increase,
reflecting a rebound in car sales that reduced backlogs of unsold
vehicles.
   Analysts said the slower growth suggested the economy may not
weaken or lapse into recession in the first half of this year, as
had been widely feared following the stock market crash in October.
   Higher business inventories and sluggish consumer spending are
considered a negative trend because they eventually collide to
cause production cutbacks and layoffs.
   The news was ignored by Wall Street, where stocks showed no
clear trend in the quietest trading this year. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 15.09 points to 2,050.07, in a session
influenced largely by takeover news and speculation.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 131.89 million
shares, the lightest since a 111.58 million-share day on Dec. 29.
   Prices barely budged in the bond market, a sensitive barometer
of interest rates and the economy. The Treasury's closely watched
30-year bond declined [ point, or about $1.25 for every $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, edged up to
8.51 percent from 8.50 percent late Friday.
   Traders were reluctant to buy or sell aggressively, largely
because of uncertainty about the January trade deficit numbers to
be released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.
   The markets have been fixated on the trade deficit for months
because the economy's unprecedented reliance on imports is
considered one of the most visible symbols of economic weakness and
declining competitiveness.
   But the deficit narrowed in November and December, suggesting
the protracted decline of the dollar over the past two years was
helping U.S. manufacturers reclaim foreign and domestic markets
from overseas competition.

<HEAD>Toymaker's Losses Lead to Restructuring Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which is
expected to miss an April 1 interest payment on its debentures,
says that unless it can restructure its finances it may have to
seek bankruptcy court protection.
   The toymaker announced Monday it lost $98.8 million in the final
quarter of 1987 and $105.4 million for the whole year.
   And Chairman Arnold C. Greenberg said Coleco has a $19 million
interest payment due on debentures April 1, but will not make that
payment.
   Coleco and other major toy manufacturers were hit hard by
declining sales last year. The losses announced by Coleco Monday
follow deficits of $110.6 in fourth-quarter 1986 and $111.2 million
for all of that year.
   The toymaker reported sales of $69 million in the last quarter
of 1987, compared with $73.7 million for the same period a year
earlier. Its 1987 sales totaled $504.5 million, up slightly from
$500.7 million in 1986.
   Coleco said it planned to announce a restructuring plan by the
end of this week. However, if all parties to the restructuring do
not agree to the plan, ``the company could find itself in
reorganization,'' said Morton E. Handel, Coleco's executive vice
president for corporate development.
   The company's short-term bank debt increased from $90.7 million
in 1986 to $142.1 million in 1987. Overall, Coleco paid $59.6
million in interest during 1987, compared with $42.7 million in
1986.
   Nearly $40 million of the 1987 interest was due to the $300
million in subordinated debentures Coleco has outstanding. Handel
said the company will propose to replace those debentures with a
combination of common stock, new debentures and debentures
convertible into stock.
   If the owners of the debentures accept the proposed exchange, it
would reduce some of Coleco's interest expenses and convert some
debt into positive ownership interest in the company.
   ``The company needs to get out from underneath its significant
debt load to obtain profitibility. The company needs to take steps
to ensure its survival,'' said Gary Jacobson, an analyst with
Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York City.
   Coleco has laid off more than 300 workers and taken other steps
to cut costs.

   Seat belts in the station wagons' optional rear-facing auxiliary
seats will be inspected and replaced, if necessary, Ford said in a
news release Monday. The belts might fit too loosely or retract
slowly if retractors were found to be installed on the wrong side
of the seats, the statement said.
   The spring seats on the Continentals are meant to prevent the
spring from touching the rear tire if the spring breaks while in
service, it said.
   Of the 9,300 Continentals being recalled, about 5,000 will be
inspected to see whether inboard attachments of the driver's and
right front seat belt assemblies were properly secured, the
statement said. Belts not properly secured to the anchor attachment
could loosen or pull free in a collision, it said.
   Inspections and necessary modifications will be made by Ford or
Lincoln-Mercury dealers at no cost to owners, the statement said.
There were no reports of accidents or injuries involving any of the
components involved with the recalls, the company said.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
postponed a decision on whether to approve a $110 million merger
that would make the regional Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. a
part of the giant Union Pacific Corp.
   ICC Chairman Heather J. Gradison canceled a scheduled vote,
saying that Commissioner J.J. Simmons III had failed to give his
fellow commission members adequate time to review his proposed
conditions for the merger.
   Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments
the day before a planned vote. Simmons did not outline his
proposals at today's brief session and, under commission rules,
amendments are not made public until they are discussed at a
meeting.
   No new meeting to consider the merger was scheduled immediately,
and Al Brown, an ICC spokesman, said it was unlikely that another
vote will be set before next week.
   The railroads contend that consolidating operations would
provide improved service at lower costs and ensure reliable
long-term transportation, especially for Midwestern grain shippers
relying on the 3,100-mile MKT system known as the ``Katy.''
   Other railroads have questioned whether the proposed merger will
reduce competition, because the Katy's lines generally parallel
some Union Pacific routes from Kansas and Missouri to southern
Texas and the Gulf Coast. The Union Pacific is a 21,500-mile
network formed by a rail merger six years ago.
   To address those concerns, Union Pacific has offered competing
railroads the rights to use some trackage on proposed merger routes.
   Without the merger, the ICC has been told, the financially
ailing Katy could face problems surviving against bigger
competitors. Operating income for the Katy declined from $37
million in 1981 to $5 million in 1986.
   The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the West to Chicago and New
Orleans. The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the
Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from Omaha to the Gulf Coast in Texas. A separate east-west
route extends between Kansas City and St. Louis.
   Union Pacific, which filed an application in November 1986
seeking government approval of the Katy acquisition, says the
merger would produce operating savings of $61 million a year.
Company officials say grain shippers would benefit through a
shorter, more direct single-line route to export markets in Texas
Gulf ports.
   However, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closings of rail yards and repair shops. Union Pacific
also plans to abandon 405 miles of track, mostly operated by Katy,
if the merger is approved.
   Union Pacific has taken steps to ease objections to the merger.
For example, the company has agreed to pay $1 million to the
southeast Kansas community of Parson in exchange for not opposing
the merger. The city would lose about 300 Katy jobs, with an
estimated $8 million payroll, under the merger.

   United Artists Communications Inc., an
entertainment conglomerate with cable television systems and the
nation's No. 1 theater chain, has announced the creation of New
York-based Corsair Pictures.
   The subsidiary firm will develop films that cost between $3
million and $10 million, an amount considered modest by Hollywood
standards.
   Stewart D. Blair, president and chief executive officer of
United Artists, announced Monday that Corsair Picture's first
production would be ``The Miss Firecracker Contest,'' a comedy
written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Beth Henley. Actress
Holly Hunter, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role as a
newscast producer in ``Broadcast News,'' has been signed to star in
the film.
   Blair said the venture was a ``low-key experiment.''
   ``We think there is a window for modestly priced,
high-demographic films,'' Blair said.
   ``We're looking for class. Not art films, but not slash and gash
movies either. We're not into teen exploitation films.''
   Frank Perry, who was nominated for an Oscar as best director for
the movie ``David and Lisa'' has been named to head Corsair. Perry
had directed for Pyramid Films, also a subsidiary of United
Artists. Corsair replaces Pyramid Films.
   Blair expects to produce three or four films a year, he said.
   ``Frank (Perry) has done 17 movies and he's only been over
budget once, and that was only be two percent,'' he said.
   Most of the firm's movies will be for theater distribution,
followed by sale to pay television or the video market. Finally
they will be sold to cable, he said.
   United Artists owns 2,000 movie screens, making it the largest
chain in the country.
   ``Certainly having that number of screens gives you a leg up,''
Blair said. ``But a movie has to be released across the board to
the most screens for it to generally make sense.''

   The stock market was unchanged in the early
going today as reluctance by traders to take positions ahead of the
government's upcoming release of trade data continued to dampen
activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was unchanged at
2,050.07 at 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 673 up, 568 down and
525 unchanged in the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 46,070,000 million shares.
   Analysts said the market fluctuated in a narrow range in the
absence of any major news.
   ``There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make
commitments'' prior to the release of January merchandise trade
figures on Thursday, said Lew Smith, a technical analyst at Bear
Stearns & Co. That sentiment that also dominated activity in the
previous session.
   ``The last two (market) responses to the trade numbers took
place in a half hour'' of trading, said Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   While analysts noted that the market may be overplaying the
impact the figure is likely to have on Wall Street, this week's
trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly ``triple witching
hour'' involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in a
very narrow range this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders said there was no fresh news overnight to influence the
market and little follow-through from Monday's strong performance.
   Prices were higher across the board on Monday mainly because of
a private forcast that farmers will be planting fewer acres of
soybeans this season than had previously been thought.
   The estimate pegged soybean acreage at 57.5 million acres, only
slightly higher than the 57.4 million acres planted last year.
   On the opening, wheat was unchanged to { cent lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.07 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to \ cent higher with March at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to { cent higher with March at $1.90\ a bushel; and soybeans were {

   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .15 cent higher with the
April contract at 73.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent
lower to .33 cent higher with March at 82.85 cents a pound; live
hogs were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 45.15

<HEAD>New Jersey Company Makes Spray Cans For Ketchup</HEAD>

   Imagine spraying ketchup on a hamburger or
spritzing mustard on a hotdog with an aerosol-like can.
   A Hoboken-based company wants just such containers to become
commonplace in kitchens across America.
   Enviro-Spray Systems Inc. also hopes its packaging technology,
already popular in Europe, will help transform the 8-year-old
research and development company into a profitable manufacturing
and marketing firm.
   The company, which went public last year, hopes to have lines of
sprayable ketchup, tomato sauces and mustard in U.S. stores by June.
   Mayonnaise, chocolate and apple sauce are waiting in the wings,
said company President Gordon L. Banks.
   ``It's the beginning of something very, very important,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   The patented spray process was introduced successfully in
Europe, where it is used to dispense a popular form of shave gel as
well as condiments, hand cleaners and pharmaceuticals.
   For its push into the United States, Enviro-Spray will focus on
food products, said Pat Black, assistant to the president. And for
the first time, the company will get involved in selling the
products as well as the process.
   The ketchup, mustard and tomato sauce to be marketed here is
made by the French concern CCRF under the Claude Vetillard label,
Ms. Black said.
   Essentially, the cans resemble aerosol sprayers but do not mix
other substances with the product to be dispensed. Inside the can
is a pouch with sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, which is
activated by a button on the can.
   When the can is activated, the two chemicals react inside the
pouch, creating pressure that forces the product out.
   And presto, a thin stripe of ketchup is applied to your waiting
hot dog.
   The ``GrowPak'' pouches are tamper proof and the food needs no
refrigeration, has a longer shelf life and is more convenient to
dispense, Banks said.
   Since no propellants are needed to make the cans work, no
fluorocarbons, identified as harmful to the protective ozone layer
in the atmosphere, are introduced into the environment.
   Banks said he hopes such advantages will convince consumers and
restaurants to buy GrowPak products and help make the company
profitable.
   Enviro-Spray had a net loss of $448,000 on sales of $455,000 in
the second quarter ended Dec. 31. That compared with a $1 million
loss on sales of $191,000 in the same period a year earlier.
   Ms. Black attributed the losses to the heavy start-up costs
associated with the development of the equipment that manufactures
the pouches. Banks sees the company entering the black by 1989.
   ``When people get their hands on these cans, they really love
(them,)'' he said.
   Whether they will be willing to spend two to three times more
for them _ $2.50 to $3 for a 9-ounce can, as Banks described their
cost _ is another question.
   ``I doubt people would be willing to pay that price,'' said Beth
Adams, spokeswoman for Pittsburgh, Pa.-based H.J. Heinz Co., a
leading U.S. ketchup producer. Ms. Adams said she had never heard
of the process.
   ``It just seems like a strange idea,'' she said, adding that
consumers may have a difficult time accepting a food product in a
type of container that usually dispenses hairspray, carpet cleaner
or disinfectant.
   About 30 percent to 40 percent of the ketchup market is
contained in plastic squirt bottles, a development of only the last
decade, she said.
   Enviro-Spray also sells its system to drug, cosmetic, pet and
plant care companies, Banks said.
   Last year, 10 million pouches with the system were sold in
Europe and 15 million are expected to be sold this year. Banks
hopes to sell 10 million in the United States in 1988.
   Company officials believe their business will grow as the
products in the cans catch on.
   ``The more cans of Vetillard's ketchup we sell, the more pouches
we sell to them,'' said Ms. Black.

   Angora goats partial to the thorny brush and arid
West Texas terrain are clothing the world's fashionable and
cornering the nation's mohair industry for ranchers of the Edwards
Plateau.
   Texas' 3,000 mohair producers generate more than $150 million in
annual mohair and goat sales _ a figure dwarfed by cotton or wool
standards but enough to give a boost to an economy battered by the
oil slump.
   Texas mohair accounts for 96 percent of U.S. production and
ranks second worldwide behind South Africa. The ranchers of Edwards
Plateau, a ranching region covering 23 million acres, have
withstood 50 years of swings in fashion to establish a firm
foothold in the world market.
   Brian J. May, executive director of the Mohair Council of
America, says Texas ranchers export 98 percent of their crop and
take pride in their small contribution toward improving the
nation's balance of trade.
   Based in San Angelo, the council has a $500,000 annual budget,
four staff members and a hefty mission promoting a tiny industry
around the world, May said, ``but we get after it.''
   ``It's the best-kept secret for Texas,'' May said. ``It's kind
of ironic these rural ranchers are producing something shown at
fashion shows in Milan, London, Paris and New York.''
   The economic contributions of the mohair industry have gained
prominence now that falling oil prices have cut into the royalties
Texas ranchers can earn from drilling and exploration on their land.
   Texans will shear 17 million to 18 million pounds this year from
their Angora goat herds, making their crop worth about $50 million,
and the sale of the animals pumps another $100 million into the
state economy, May said.
   South Africa, meanwhile, produced 28.3 million pounds in 1987,
compared with U.S. production of 15.5 million pounds.
   That compares with a nationwide 1987 cotton crop worth an
estimated $4.5 billion, according to the National Cotton Council in
Memphis, Tenn. Texas' share was worth about $1.5 billion, said
council spokesman Fred Johnson.
   Mohair comes exclusively from Angora goats _ not to be mistaken
with the Angora fiber that comes from rabbits _ and the animals
thrive in a 15-county region in Texas as equidistant from the
equator as South Africa, May said.
   ``Both (areas) are arid, and have the same brushy type of ranch
land,'' he said. ``They need browse or brush, they don't do very
well in tall grass. Here we have a lot of cactus and rocks and
mesquite trees and live-oak trees.''
   Being a speciality fabric, mohair is especially vulnerable to
the fancy of fashion designers. Prices have swung in recent years
from a low of 30 cents a pound in 1971 to a high of $5.10 in 1979.
The current price is about $2.40, May said.
   When mohair slips below $2 a pound, ranchers are eligible for
federal farm subsidies, May said. The funds come from a tariff on
imported wool and mohair and not taxpayers.
   ``It's a very fluctuating market because it's a luxury fiber,''
May said. ``It's been paying off really well since 1976 ... but now
it's starting to slow down.''
   Mohair weaves into a brushy-type fabric, while the look now is
smooth and sleek, May said.
   But the Mohair Council won't be daunted by the whims of fashion,
and May says it plans promotions in Europe, England, Italy, Germany
and the Far East. Japan, Taiwan and Korea buy about 25 percent of
Texas mohair and use it in men's suits.
   ``We're going to China this spring and Russia next fall to
develop a new market,'' May said.
   The council will also spend more than a tenth of its budget _
$55,000 _ for a 30-minute fashion show at Dallas Apparel Market
this weekend.
   The Mohair Council announced in early February it had appointed
its first national spokeswoman, former Miss USA Kim Dutton of
Texas. The 1977 pageant winner and her husband, Cody Dutton, raise
Angora goats in Boerne.
   In addition to promoting ranching, Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower wants to make sure the state gets its share of the mohair
processing business. A financial marketing analyst for the
commissioner, Angelo Piccirillo, said millions of dollars are being
lost because raw mohair leaves the state to be spun and woven
elsewhere.
   The two wool and mohair cleaning plants in Texas can handle
about 2 million pounds a year _ a fraction of total production,
Piccirillo said.
   The department is working with a group in El Paso interested in
setting up a third cleaning plant, he said, and is coordinating a
study with Texas Tech University on the potential of processing
mohair and turning it into a finished product.

<HEAD>Oslo's Price Explosion A Sign of Wider Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High prices have always made it tough for
visitors to Oslo, but now even well-paid Norwegians are finding it
hard to cope.
   Fashion clothing shops, often used as barometers of consumer
spending, rarely see customers, and newspapers are carrying
going-out-of-business ads from well-known furriers. Only a few
years ago, they shared the bonanza of Norway's oil boom.
   Kaupang's Bokhandel, a leading Oslo bookstore for more than 60
years, closed its doors after Christmas, one of several
family-owned shops that apparently succumbed to sharply rising
rents.
   The price explosion in this seaside capital is a sign of
nationwide problems.
   Until recently, Norwegians were cushioned by high wage increases
and easy credit. They emptied their savings accounts, which were
taxed, took tax-deductible loans and spent freely, while the
government used its North Sea oil revenues to cover the public's
debt from overspending.
   Norwegians also benefit from a welfare state, which provides
free hospitalization and other social services, making savings less
important. Education also is free, but high school books can cost
200 kroner _ about $31 _ each.
   They barely noticed that their capital had become one of the
most expensive cities in Europe, which is how it ranked in a survey
of 103 countries by Business International published in December.
   Taking New York City as a standard of 100, Oslo was rated 139,
the highest in Europe and eighth in the world.
   ``We have been living like some big oil country in the Middle
East,'' said Egil Bakke, director of the Price Control Agency.
   But now the spending spree is over. The government has declared
war on an inflation rate that reached 8.7 percent last year, more
than twice the European average.
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labor government
introduced a stiff wage regulation bill this month limiting pay
hikes over the next year to one krone per hour, or about 15 cents.
   The bill was the most severe economic package since a
15-month-long wage-price freeze was imposed 10 years ago.
   Mrs. Brundtland heads a minority Labor government against an
array of non-socialist opposition parties that criticize her
interventionist policies and blame her for creating the problem by
letting government spending get out of hand.
   But everyone agrees urgent action is required, and the bill is
likely to sail through with little opposition.
   ``There is a need for a breathing space to steady the
situation,'' former Conservative Prime Minister Kaare Willoch told
the Associated Press.
   Norway's problems would make most other countries envious. The
country has virtually no unemployment, and despite falling oil
income, it is expected to have a budget surplus of 9.3 billion
kroner _ $1.45 billion _ this year.
   But wealth brought complacency. Wages and prices rose swiftly
for two years, until Norway found it had priced itself out of some
European markets.
   In 1987, a year when the normal work week was reduced from 40 to
37 1@2 hours, wage costs per unit produced rose by more than 13
percent in Norway, compared with a 5 percent average in Norway's
trading partners, according to the Finance Ministry.
   Poor management became endemic. The state-owned oil company,
Statoil, is now overrunning its budget for a new refinery by 100
percent. The scandal caused the resignation of company president
Arve Johnsen, who built Statoil into a world leader.
   Even more embarrassing, the cost overruns were almost as high
for the new headquarters of the central bank, Norges Bank.
   A major step toward recovery came on Feb. 26, when the main
trade union federation reached an agreement with employers for a 5
percent ceiling on wage increases.
   Mrs. Brundtland moved swiftly to declare a freeze on further
negotiations, imposing the wage package on the rest of the economy,
until a wage regulation bill could be legislated.
   The measures are coming late for Oslo, a city of 450,000 that
curls around the tip of a clear-watered, 60-mile-long fjord.
Traveling businessmen know it as a pleasant place to stop _ as long
as the company is paying.
   A double room at a major international hotel costs 1,505 kroner,
or $237, and a beer at the bar costs 35 kroner, or $5.50. A short
cab ride can run about $11.
   Norwegians themselves find living costs outstrip their salaries.
A double-meat hamburger at a fast-food restaurant costs more than
$4, and a pair of jeans is close to $80. A kilogram of pure ground
beef at the supermarket costs the equivalent of $10.65 per pound.
   ``I always have to shop around and look for the daily
specials,'' said housewife Randi Hoel, who says she patronizes as
many as 10 different food stores in a week to look for bargains.
   Like other Scandinavian countries, Norway has put a high tax on
alcohol to discourage drinking.Sales for home use are made only
through the state-owned liquor monopoly, where a liter of average
quality scotch whisky is a whopping 290 kroner, or $46.

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has
withdrawn a key objection to New Hampshire's emergency evacuation
plans for the $5.3 billion Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Seabrook opponents, citing the removal of a key critic of the
plans from a FEMA review board, charged that the agency caved in to
pressure from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the plant's
owners. A Seabrook spokesman today called that charge ``a
smokescreen.'' A FEMA spokesman would not comment.
   The agency said in testimony to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission on Monday that shelters are not needed and evacuation
alone offers enough protection for people that crowd beaches near
the seacoast reactor on hot summer days.
   Last summer, the agency would not approve the plans, citing 55
deficiencies observed in a February 1986 drill. A major objection
was that there aren't enough airtight buildings to protect people
from dangerous radiation that could be released in an accident.
   Now the state has considered sheltering and determined that ``in
most cases evacuation would be a preferred option and would provide
ample time to move the beach population from the area safely,
before there would be any radioactive release,'' Seabrook spokesman
David Scanzoni said today.
   FEMA's new testimony concludes: ``The requirement for a range of
protective measures has been satisfied, even though the state of
New Hampshire has chosen not to shelter the summer beach population
except in very limited circumstances. With respect to the summer
beach population, (federal standards) have been met.''
   FEMA officials acknowledged in their testimony that they were
deferring to the NRC staff's argument that evacuation offers better
protection than sheltering.
   The NRC staff and other four other federal agencies out of eight
involved in an interagency review of the plan had been trying to
persuade FEMA to change its position, according to testimony during
hearings on the New Hampshire plans. The other four were the
Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental
Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Seabrook is completed but unlicensed until it can gain NRC
approval for evacuation plans for a 10-mile zone around it. An NRC
licensing board resumes hearings next month on the New Hampshire
plans.
   Massachusetts officials won't cooperate in planning for six
Massachusetts communities within the 10-mile zone. Seabrook has
submitted its own plans for Massachusetts. No hearings have been
set.
   The new FEMA testimony stopped short of endorsing the New
Hampshire plans, but it clears a major obstacle.
   Robert Backus, lawyer for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League,
said, ``I view it as a total agency collapse.'' He noted that
Edward Thomas, a top FEMA official in its Northeast regional office
who had written the earlier criticism of Seabrook's plans, was not
involved in the new testimony.
   ``I suspect that there was a fight for the soul of the agency
here and the guys who are no longer the witnesses are not the guys
who won the fight,'' Backus said.
   ``FEMA has capitulated to those who want Seabrook licensed
regardless of the fact that minimum safety requirements cannot be
met,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda today declined to comment on the new
testimony and on charges that the agency succombed to pressure to
change its opinion.
   Scanzoni denied that Seabrook officials pressured FEMA.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Rising Foreign Investment in US `Is a Plus'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress today that foreign investment in the United States
``is a plus,'' even at current record levels.
   ``It is a highly desirable international trend,'' Greenspan told
the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee.
   He said he was less worried about the fact that more and more
U.S. assets are being aquired by Japanese and other foreign
investors than he would be if they were simply amassing U.S.
dollars.
   Despite the recent increase in foreign holdings in the United
States, ``we still have a $50 billion greater balance in investment
abroad,'' Greenspan said.
   The Fed chief also said that chances were ``relatively good''
for maintaining the current economic recovery, now in its sixth
year and a record for peacetime expansions, ``through another
year.''
   But, he added, ``although the near-term prospects thus look
reasonably encouraging, major uncertainties remain and we should
not be complacent about the nation's economic future.''
   ``To a considerable extent, we are still sailing in uncharterted
waters,'' he said. He reiterated earlier testimony that reducing
the government's $150 billion annual budget deficit should be
government's No. 1 priority.
   He hailed recent data showing that unemployment in February had
dipped to 5.7 percent, its lowest level since May 1979. He said
that, while theoretically there was a point at which lower
unemployment rates could trigger a new burst of wage-driven
inflation, ``I don't think we're there yet.''
   Greenspan was asked by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., whether he
was troubled by the extent of the growing foreign investment in the
United States.
   ``Japan is buying America and leasing it back to us,'' D'Amato
said.
   But Greenspan responded, ``I am very little concerned about the
issue of foreign investment in the United States. On the contrary,
integration of world economies is a desirable trend.''
   ``We will find that foreign investment in the United States will
be a plus,'' Greenspan said. He said that companies in the United
States that have been bought by foreign concerns have become ``good
corporate citizens.''
   He said it was difficult to tell the exact extent of foreign
holdings in the United States. In terms of U.S. Treasury securities
alone, foreign investors held 16.4 percent of the total at the end
of last year, Greenspan said.
   In other testimony, Greenspan called upon newly industrialized
countries in Asia, and particularly Taiwan, to do more to bring
their economic and monetary polices into equilibrium with the
United States and other major trading partners.
   He also praised the recent stance by the government of British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for not favoring intervention by
the Bank of England in support of the pound against the German mark
and other key currencies.

   The stock market moved modestly lower today as
investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the government's
upcoming release of trade data and the year's first ``triple
witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.15 points to
2,045.92 at noon on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 619 down and
526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 66,680,000 million shares.
   Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range in the
absence of any major news.
   ``There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make
commitments'' prior to the government's release of January
merchandise trade figures on Thursday, said Lew Smith, a technical
analyst at Bear Stearns & Co. That sentiment also dominated
activity in the previous session.
   ``The last two (market) responses to the trade numbers took
place in a half hour'' of trading, said Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   While analysts noted that the market may be overplaying the
impact the figure is likely to have on Wall Street, this week's
trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly triple witching
hour involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.
   The transportation sector was the only arena to post a clear
trend. Airline stocks were up across the board amid reports that a

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade surged to a record $160.7 billion in 1987 with the
additional red ink pushing the country further into the hole as the
world's largest debtor nation, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the current account deficit
last year was 13.7 percent higher than the previous record of
$141.4 billion set in 1986 despite the fact that the deficit for
the final three months of the year narrowed slightly.
   The current account covers not only the flow of merchandise
across the U.S. border but also the flow of services, primarily
investment earnings, between countries.
   While the United States has run deficits in merchandise trade
for 16 of the past 17 years, the current account was in surplus as
recently as 1981 as Americans' earnings on overseas investments
were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.
   But since that time Americans have handed over billions of
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods. With all of
that wealth now in foreign hands, the perennial advantage the
United States has had in investments has shifted and America has
become the world's largest debtor country.
   Being a net debtor means that foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments than Americans hold in foreign investments. America was
last a net debtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a
foreign debt of $111.9 billion. That debt grew to $263.6 billion at
the end of 1986.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the
House-Senate Joint Economic Committee today that foreign investment
in the United States ``is a highly desirable international trend.''
   He said he was less worried about the fact that that more and
more U.S. assets are being acquired by Japanese and other foreign
investors than he would be if they were simply amassing U.S.
dollars.
   Economists said with today's new figures the total debt has
probably surpassed $400 billion, although the government's official
accounting will not be made until June.
   Today's report showed that the bulk of the 1987 trade deficit
came from a $159.2 billion imbalance in merchandise trade, a figure
which was first reported last month. Adding to that deficit were
payments of $13.5 billion in foreign aid and other government
transfer payments such as Social Security paid to retirees living
overseas.
   That figure was reduced slightly by a surplus of $12 billion in
the services category. While foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments, the payments still showed a slight positive because
many of the older U.S. investments are earning a higher rate of
return.
   However, the services surplus was down from $18.6 billion in
1986 and has been dwindling steadily.
   Economists expect the services surplus to be wiped out
altogether in future years as more and more American dollars are
paid to foreigners to meet interest payments on the U.S. debt.
   For the fourth quarter, the current account deficit shrank
slightly to $39 billion, down from $43.4 billion in the third
quarter. This improvement reflected a slightly smaller merchandise
trade deficit and a resumption of surpluses in the services
category. In the third quarter, the United States had run a deficit
with the rest of the world in investment earnings for the first
time in 29 years.
   Democratic presidential candidates have been attacking the
administration, charging that the country's new status as the
world's biggest debtor is directly attributable to the failure of
the administration to come to grips with huge federal budget
deficits.
   The Democrats argue that the federal government's need to borrow
billions of dollars each year to cover the shortfall between
revenues and spending attracted large sums of foreign investment to
this country.
   While the administration agrees that deficit reduction is needed
to reduce the country's dependence on foreign investment,
administration officials contend that the change in the country's
investment position has been over-dramatized.
   The annual Economic Report of the President said the
transformation of the country to debtor status was ``no cause for
alarm'' because the amount in interest payments to foreigners
needed to service that debt is tiny in terms of the overall U.S.
economy.
   The report estimated interest payments to foreigners would total
less than one-half of 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product.
   But many private economists warn that the country's debtor
status is a threat to the United States and will ultimately result
in a lower standard of living as more and more money is transferred
into foreign hands.
   ``The most profound and enduring legacy of the Reagan period is
its conversion of the United States from the largest creditor
country in the world to the largest debtor,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
``The trade deficit and its financial consequences hang like a
sword of Damocles over the U.S. economy.''
   Bergsten argues that the U.S. need to attract large sums of
foreign investment to meet its debt obligations makes American
economic and foreign policy ``exceedingly vulnerable to decisions
made abroad for the indefinite future.''
   He estimated that the U.S. debt to the rest of the world would
likely approach $1 trillion before beginning to level off at the
end of 1995.
   This rise in debt assumes modest improvements in the current
account balance.

<HEAD>General Mills Reports Sharp Third-Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. said its earnings jumped
25.5 percent in the third quarter of its fiscal year, prompted
largely by growth in its consumers foods division.
   Earnings in the 3 months ended Feb. 28 totaled $71.4 million, or
83 cents per share, compared with $56.9 million, or 64 cents per
share a year ago.
   Revenues increased 10 percent, to $1.44 billion from $1.31
billion in the same period last year, the company said in a
statement.
   For the first three quarters, earnings totaled $228.2 million,
or $2.60 per share, on sales of $4.33 billion, compared with $185.9
million, or $2.09 per share, on $3.84 billion in the 1986 period.
   Both periods benefited from an accounting change that resulted
in a $5.8 million gain in the third quarter and a $17.3 million
gain for the nine-month period, the company said.
   Chairman Bruce Atwater said good volume growth in consumer
foods, strong performance by key restaurant concepts and
significant productivity gains led to a 15 percent cumulative gain
in operating profits.
   Year-to-date results also benefited from the effective tax rate
declining to 40.3 percent from 48.4 percent last year, primarily
reflecting the effect of Federal Tax Reform, he said.
   Consumer Foods achieved a 2 percent increase in domestic package
food volume in the third quarter, leading to sales and operating
profit gains of 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, Atwater said.
   Restaurant results in the third quarter showed gains in sales
and operating profits of 14 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
   ``These results reflect strong performance by Red Lobster
seafood restaurants, where efforts to increase lunch business
helped boost customer traffic over 5 percent above last year's
comparable quarter and the successful expansion of The Olive Garden
Italian restaurants,'' Atwater said.

<HEAD>3M To Pay Lion's Share of $8 Million Settlement In Fatal Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. has
paid $7 million of an $8 million settlement to the families of
three men who died in an industrial accident in 1984, lawyers for
the parties said today.
   The remaining $1 million of the settlement was paid by the
McDowell-Davis Co., a Milan, Ill., contracting firm 3M had hired to
clean out a large chemical holding tank at its plant in Cordova,
the lawyers said.
   The three men, McDowell-Davis owner Carl McDowell, 37, of Milan;
and his employees Daniel Walker, 27, of East Moline; and Scott
Syverson, 27, of Davenport, Iowa, were overcome by nitrogen gas
when they entered the 10,000-gallon tank on April 5, 1984,
according to both attorneys.
   The tank had held magnetic oxide, a chemical used to coat
recording tapes, and was supposed to be empty, said Mary Minella, a
Chicago attorney who represented the victims' families.
   But Chicago attorney Fred Schulz, who represented 3M in the
case, said the men had not checked for danger before entering the
tank.
   ``The workers who went in didn't do anything to check whether it
was safe or not,'' Schulz said. ``They just popped right in the
tank and unfortunately died.''
   The families received the checks on Friday, one week after the
settlement was entered into before U.S. District Court Judge
Nicholas J. Bua, Ms. Minella said.

   Quaker State Corp. is trying to sell its
100 Arctic Circle restaurants in nine Western states, including
Utah, a company spokesman says.
   ``I will confirm talks are going on ... But I'm just not going
to get into it any further,'' said Benton H. Faulkner. ``It (Arctic
Circle) just didn't fit our mainstream, marketing automotive oil
and other automotive after-market products and services.''
   Faulkner said Monday that Quaker is planning to keep the
Minit-Lube chain, which was originally affiliated with Arctic
Circle Inc. Most of the Minit-Lube centers are in the western
United States.
   Gary Roberts, an Arctic Circle official at the company's Salt
Lake City headquarters, said Arctic Circle Restaurants are in Utah,
California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Montana and
Nebraska.
   Quaker State purchased Arctic Circle and its 90-service-center
Minit-Lube chain in November 1985 from J.R. Edwards, son of Arctic
Circle founder Don Carlos Edwards, and five other partners.
   The number of Arctic Circle restaurants have remained at about
100 since 1985, said Faulkner.
   Minit-Lube outlets recently numbered 261, up from 98 at the end
of 1985, he added.
   Quaker State markets consumer automotive products and produces
lubricants, fuels and automotive lighting equipment.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 150 complaints of sudden acceleration
have prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
open an investigation of the Honda Acura Legend and Austin Rover
Sterling.
   The agency said Monday the investigation covers 62,500 1986-1988
Acura Legends and Austin Rover Sterlings with automatic shifts. The
Austin Rover Sterling uses the same mechanical components as the
Legend.
   The new investigation brings to seven the number of sudden
acceleration probes being conducted by NHTSA. Five of the
investigations involve imported vehicles.
   American Honda, through spokesman Bob Butorac in Gardena,
Calif., declined to comment specifically on the NHTSA
investigation, saying it would be inappropriate ``because we simply
haven't heard anything yet.''
   ``We've checked every vehicle in which that incident (sudden
acceleration) was reported, (and) never found any mechanical or
electrical defect that could have caused it,'' Butorac said.
   He declined to say what could have brought on the sudden
acceleration incidents in the absence of a mechanical or electrical
cause.
   NHTSA has received 147 complaints of sudden acceleration in the
cars, resulting in 82 accidents, 11 injuries and no fatalities.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based public-issues
group, had petitioned NHTSA to open an engineering analysis of the
alleged throttle problems.
   Typically, Acura Legend owners report their cars idle normally
in park, but race out of control when shifted into either drive or
reverse, said the center, a private organization often at odds with
the auto industry and its regulators.
   NHTSA has conducted three investigations into another Honda
model, the Accord, without ordering a recall, the center said.
   The center said it has reports of at least 120 Accord sudden
acceleration accidents resulting in three deaths.
   Honda recalled 4,500 of its 1988 Civics in November because of
speed fluctuation when the cars were idling, the center said.

   The stock market held at modestly lower levels
today in dull, quiet trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 3.82 points to
2,046.25 at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in the overall tally

511 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93,580,000 million shares.
   Analysts said trading was lackluster, with institutional
investors showing little interest in the market.
   Traders have cited Thursday's release of merchandise trade
figures for January and the year's first ``triple witching hour''
as reasons for staying on the sidelines, but some analysts are
skeptical of the strategy.
   ``There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make
commitments'' prior to the two events, a sentiment that also
dampened activity in the previous session, said Lew Smith, a
technical analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.
   While activity also slowed ahead of the release of the trade
figures in the previous two months, Smith said that ``when
something becomes the thing to do, it loses its relevance.''
   The market needed only half an hour to respond to the trade
figures in recent months, said Larry Wachtel, first vice president
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who said investors are using
the numbers as an excuse to ``sit on their rear ends.''
   While analysts indicated the market may be overplaying the
impact the figures are likely to have on Wall Street, this week's
trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly triple witching
hour involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.

   Demand for higher-priced California premium
wines surged as the four-year boom in wine coolers deflated in
1987, dragging down the overall U.S. wine market, an industry
observer says.
   Some California wineries even had to go to Washington State for
their chardonnays because the growing demand for premium table
wines coincided with a short crop, according to a year-end industry
report by Jon Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, the
nation's leading wine business consultants. The report was released
this week.
   The premium segment of the industry was worth $740 million in
sales last year, up 21 percent from 1986. Fredrikson pointed out
that the premiums represented only 20 percent of all California
table wine gallonage but 45 percent of table wine revenues.
   Burdened by a weak dollar that forced importers to raise prices,
sales of foreign wines plummeted 21 percent last year, on top of a
25 percent decline the year before.
   Ironically, one of the few bright spots in the import picture
was Italy's Riunite, scoring a 110 percent improvement on its
cooler-type peach drink.
   At the same time, California's jug wines _ a $4 billion-plus
segment with more than 80 percent of California wine sales _
continued downward for the fifth straight year as the U.S. trend
toward better wines continued to rise.
   Fredrikson, who a couple of years ago could see no halt to the
cooler phenomenon, described last year as a ``meltdown.''
   From a few gallons in 1981, shipments of the fizzy blends of
white wine, watgger and fruit juices rose to 8 million gallons in
1983, 34 million in 1984, 88 million in 1985, and 120 million in
1986, but then added only 2 million more last year.
   But for all their fiscal flatness, coolers accounted for more
than 21 percent of the 423.8 million gallons California vintners
sold last year.
   The ``cooler wars,'' as Fredrikson put it, saw the lead change
from the originator, California Cooler, to Gallo's Bartles &
Jaymes, and now to Seagrams with 31 percent of the market.
   There were two major growth areas in the champagne category,
despite a 6 percent overall dip in sales.
   After its 48 percent surge in 1986, Guild's Cook's Champagne
posted a 17 percent improvement last year with 1.3 million cases.
Korbel continued the market leader with another record year, up 16
percent on shipments of more than 1.3 million cases.
   The showing also reflected the increasing popularity of the
expensive ``methode champenoise'' way of making champagne _
fermentation in the individual bottles rather than bulk in
stainless steel vats.
   The top five California wine companies start with Gallo, the
world's largest wine producer with 39.9 percent of California's
total wine sales, followed by Heublein, 10.2 percent; Vintners
International, 9.1 percent; California Cooler, 5 percent, and
Guild, 4 percent.
   Prices were mostly up last year in the heavily consumed chablis
category. The top average price paid for the popular 1.5-liter case
was $14.27, while the favorite bar item _ the 18-liter box _ went
for $15.25 each. At $1.50 to $2.50 a glass, the bar makes up to
1,400 percent profit on each box.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Uproar Over Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury chief Nigel Lawson announced Britain's
first budget surplus in nearly 20 years today and was shouted down
by opposition legislators in one of the unruliest annual budget
presentations in parliamentary history.
   The deputy speaker twice suspended the proceedings during
Lawson's speech, and opposition socialist Laborites chanted
``Shame, Shame'' as he announced huge tax cuts for the rich.
   Lawson said he was slashing the top tax bracket from 60 percent
to 40 percent.
   A Scottish legislator, Alec Salmond, was expelled after calling
the budget an ``obscenity,'' with tax cuts instead of extra
spending on health and welfare services. Lawson's speech was halted
while legislators voted overwhelmingly to expel Salmond.
   Lawson reduced the basic rate of tax from 27 percent to 25
percent, and cut Britain's six tax brackets to just two _ 25
percent and 40 percent. The 40 percent top tax rate _ down from a
60 percent top bracket _ will be payable on income over 19,300
pounds ($35,700) a year.
   The measures were the most sweeping changes since Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher came to power on a platform of cutting taxes,
encouraging private enterprise and curbing inflation and state
spending.
   Lawson announced last autumn the size of the $290 billion budget
for the fiscal year ending in 1989. Today, armed with the battered
leather budget box, the chancellor disclosed how the government
will raise the money.
   Lawson, declaring Conservative government has transformed the
British economy, announced a surplus of 3 billion pounds ($5.5
billion) in the budget.
   ``Tax breaks for the rich, poll tax (a new property tax) for the
poor and nothing in it for the health service _ it's an absolute
and utter obscenity,''' shouted Salmond, of the Scottish National
Party.
   His expulsion went ahead after a vote that delayed Lawson's
speech for 12 minutes. The two other Scottish nationalists in the
650-member Commons walked out in sympathy.
   As the session resumed, Laborites murmured restively as Lawson
continued to list tax cuts. The opposition broke into a new uproar,
amid shouts of ``rich man's budget.'' Conservative legislators,
opposite the Laborites from the facing green leather benches,
yelled ``Quiet'' and ``Sit Down.''
   The proceedings then were suspended a second time.
   Parliamentary officials hustled four uniformed nurses out of the
public gallery after they shouted slogans in defense of
state-funded health care. ``The National Health Service is not safe
in your hands. Thanks a lot Thatcher,'' one shouted.
   Despite buoyant revenues and economic growth, today's budget was
clouded by a split between Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson on how to
handle the soaring British pound.
   Even with eve-of-budget hesitancy in currency markets, the pound
finished at $1.85 on Monday, up 8 cents in a week, and at 3.08 West
German marks, well above the 3-mark level central to Lawson's
strategy of keeping a rein on sterling. A high pound hurts British
exports.
   Mrs. Thatcher last week ruled out such intervention as immediate
pound sales by the Bank of England and lower interest rates to
depress sterling on the grounds that the moves would fuel inflation.
   A budget focusing on tax reform rather than huge giveaways would
likely be another boost for the pound.
   The budget surplus is due partly to higher-than-anticipated
revenues from increased wages and company profits. In line with a
string of trim, low deficit budgets since Mrs. Thatcher won power
in 1979, Lawson originally predicted a $7.4 billion deficit in
1988-89, and revised that to $1.85 billion last autumn.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   It was a sluggish session with little price movement in either
direction.
   ``This is the reflection of the indecisiveness of the market

move prices either way.
   ``Prices were under pressure most of the day,'' he said. ``There
was a little buying near the close and that lifted prices a little,
but there was no big feature today.

<HEAD>Company Showing Device That Defibrillates Hearts Over Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A device that can jolt a fibrillating heart back
to normal over the telephone is scheduled for a demonstration in
New York on Wednesday, three months after it won government
approval.
   The MDphone System is aimed at heart patients who are at risk of
cardiac fibrillation, in which the heart twitches uselessly because
its electrical system has gone haywire.
   About 450,000 Americans die of heart attacks annually before
ever reaching a hospital, and immediate defibrillation could revive
some of the victims, says the maker of the MDphone System, Medphone
Corp. of Paramus, N.J.
   The system consists of a $7,000 home unit and a $30,000 base
station installed at a nearby hospital. When a patient goes into
defibrillation, someone else at home is supposed to open the
MDphone case and put a pair of chest pads on the victim.
   The rest of the work is handled over the phone by the hospital,
including monitoring of the heart and, if necessary, triggering of
the defibrillator.
   Medphone is still negotiating to make its first sales of the
device, which was cleared for marketing last December by the Food
and Drug Administration. The company says it is in active talks
with a number of hospitals.
   Medphone said hospitals could charge patients $250 to $300 per
month, which would cover the lease or rental of the equipment and
the round-the-clock response service. It says hospitals could
charge additional fees for interpretation of electrocardiograms
and, if necessary, defibrillation.
   The main competition for the MDphone System would be implantable
defibrillators, which are about the size of a pack of cigarettes,
cost roughly $14,000 and have been on the market for about 2{ years.

   The stock market drifted modestly lower in late
trading today amid very light activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.28 to
2,038.79 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers were about even with gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 707 up, 725 down and 510
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110,260,000 million shares with
an hour to go.
   Analysts said trading was lackluster, with institutional
investors showing little interest in the market.
   ``The key thing people are watching is volume,'' said Ron Doran,
head of institutional trading at First Albany Corp. ``Right now
volume is telling us nobody really cares.''
   Traders have cited Thursday's release of merchandise trade
figures for January and the year's first ``triple witching hour''
as reasons for staying on the sidelines, but some analysts are
skeptical of the strategy.
   ``There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make
commitments'' prior to the two events, a sentiment that also
dampened activity in the previous session, said Lew Smith, a
technical analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.
   While activity also slowed ahead of the release of the trade
figures in the previous two months, Smith said that ``when
something becomes the thing to do, it loses its relevance.''
   The market needed only half an hour to respond to the trade
figures in recent months, said Larry Wachtel, first vice president
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who said investors are using
the numbers as an excuse to ``sit on their rear ends.''
   While analysts indicated the market may be overplaying the
impact the figures are likely to have on Wall Street, this week's
trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly triple witching
hour involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The past couple of witching hours have been relatively
uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread
out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program
traders.
   The transportation sector managed to post a clear, positive
trend. Airline stocks were up across the board amid reports that a
number of carriers plan to tighten restrictions on discount fares.
Allegis rose 1] to 79|, AMR rose 1 to 42, Delta was up } to 47, and
NWA Inc. was up { to 43].
   First RepublicBank fell | to 1[. Texas' largest bank holding
company said it might seek a federal bailout.
   Traders complained that the technology sector failed to help
establish a positive trend for the day. IBM was down 1~ to 113|,
which worked to drag the Dow Jones industrial average down. Digital
Equipment fell 2~ to 115~.
   Auto stocks were mostly lower. Chrysler was down ] to 24, Ford
was down ] to 43~ and General Motors fell ] to 71]. The major
automakers reported mostly mixed results for the early March sales
period.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.64 to 149.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 0.70 at 296.24.

   General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services Inc. will provide
worldwide marketing, business development, mission analysis and

``The establishment of General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services
further reinforces this commitment.''
   Jack Isabel, a General Dynamics spokesman, said the company's
main competitors in commercial-satellite launching would be
McDonnell Douglas Corp., Martin Marietta Corp. and Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the European Space Agency.
   He said China and Japan also had entered the market.
   Dennis R. Dunbar, formerly director of commercial launch
services at the company's space systems division, has been named
vice president and managing director of the new wholly owned
subsidary.

<HEAD>Investors Sue CBOE on Stock Index Options October Crash
Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment partnership has filed a
class action lawsuit against the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
alleging it was responsible for millions of dollars of losses
during the October market crash.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
also names the Options Clearing Corp., which processes all
securities options trades in the nation.
   The investment partnership, M&M, sued on behalf of the more than
1,000 customers it said traded in excess of $40 million worth of a
November series of stock options on the Standard & Poor's 100 stock
index.
   The investors contend the exchange violated its rules by not
halting trade in stock index options in a more timely fashion.
   It said the exchange operated a ``fraud and deceit upon the
plaintiffs'' by failing to maintain a fair and equitable market.
   Exchange spokesman Warren Moulds said it ``won't comment on
pending litigation.''
   George Hender, executive vice president of the clearing
corporation, said he couldn't comment because he had not seen the
lawsuit.
   The lawsuit contends that on the morning of Oct. 20, the day
after the crash, M&M put in an order to buy November put options.
   A put option gives the buyer the right to sell stock index
contracts at a set price before the expiration date.
   The system in use at the exchange requires that opening trades
be rotated among the various contracts, and that free trading
begins only when the rotation is completed, the lawsuit said.
   The average length of the opening rotation is 12 to 15 minutes,
it said, but in the hectic aftermath of Black Monday, opening
rotation took 2 hours and 30 minutes.
   By the time M&M's contracts were executed, prices ``were
arbitrarily high and grossly inflated,'' the lawsuit contends.
   ``Once they placed that order, they couldn't withdraw it,'' said
attorney Leigh R. Lasky, who represents M&M. ``They were locked
in.''
   The lawsuit contends that for the investors to have broken even,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have had to plunge an
additional 50 percent by Nov. 20, the expiration date of the
options.
   M&M invested $23,400 and lost 90 percent of it, Lasky said
Tuesday. The class of investors, which had put up more than $40
million, probably lost close to 90 percent, too, he said.
   The lawsuit asks that the investors be reimbursed.

   Stock prices were little changed today in light,
lackluster trading.
   Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range as both
institutional and retail investors remained on the sidelines while
awaiting fresh economic news due out later in the week.
   The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise
trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first ``triple
witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock
indexes will expire simultaneously.
   While concern over the two events dampened activity in the
previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants
may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the
witching hour might have.
   Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade
figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the

   First RepublicBank Corp., buffeted by bad loans
and wary customers, announced Tuesday it will turn to federal
regulators for help in restructuring and rebuilding its ailing
financial reserves.
   Bank analysts said the move could bode a buyout or merger for
Dallas-based First RepublicBank, the largest bank holding company
in the Southwest and the 13th-largest in the nation.
   The announcement came as Houston-based First City Bancorporation
of Texas Inc. struggled against a Tuesday deadline for debt holders
to submit their securities in a rescue plan that represents the
second-largest bank bailout in U.S. history.
   The two Texas banks have been plagued by the state's economic
downturn sparked by the sharp fall in oil prices in recent years
and its ensuing fallout on Texas' lifeblood industies of oil and
real estate.
   First RepublicBank officials said they are holding preliminary
discussions with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to restructure
and recapitalize the company.
   ``The decision to approach the FDIC is, in our judgment,
important to providing a stable environment for First
RepublicBank's customers,'' said Gerald W. Fronterhouse, the
company's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``Naturally, we had hoped to work our way out of the current
difficulties without assistance from the FDIC,'' he said.
``However, we are now announcing this changed course of action to
help clear away any concerns our customers may have.''
   First RepublicBank spokesman Joseph C. Bowles said the loss of
about $600 million in deposits over a five-day period last month
prompted the need to seek federal help.
   ``Certainly two or three weeks ago we didn't believe this would
be necessary,'' he said.
   First RepublicBank officials tried last month to combat rumors
that the bak was considering merging with another financial
institution, taking the unusual step of buying full-page newspaper
ads to assure customers their deposits were safe.
   Bowles said he didn't believe the latest development would lead
more depositors to withdraw their money because ``we expect our
customers will understand that their money is protected.''
   The bank is discussing whether to pursue open-bank assistance
from the FDIC. Generally, that aid comes only if the FDIC
determines that keeping a bank open would be less costly to the
government than letting the bank fail.
   An FDIC bailout of that kind would require regulators to
determine that the bank would fail without help.
   But Frank Anderson, an independent bank consultant from Dallas,
said, ``Most people feel like there will be a buyer.''
   Sandy Flannigan, an analyst and vice president of PaineWebber
Inc., said the decision by First RepublicBank to seek federal aid
will renew confidence in Texas banking.
   ``It should lend further stability to the banking system in the
state,'' she said. ``There has been a great deal of negative press,
and the fact that they are seeking some kind of FDIC assistance
should create some additional confidence in the system.''
   Anderson said that if it takes an infusion of federal money to
get the bank on its feet, ``that's the way it's going to have to
be.'

<HEAD>Lilly Says Trust Fund For Anti-Arthritis Drug Users Is
`Unnecessary'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly & Co. rejected on Tuesday a demand
by British lawmakers that the pharmaceutical giant set up a trust
fund for victims of a discontinued anti-arthritis medication.
   The demand was made Monday by 100 British lawmakers who signed a
letter to Richard D. Wood, Lilly chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Hundreds of former users of the anti-arthritis drug Oraflex,
sold in Britain under the name Opren, sued the Indianapolis-based
Lilly in the mid-1980s, claiming the drug caused severe side
effects, including liver and kidney disorders. The drug also was
linked to several deaths.
   Lilly withdrew the drug from the market in 1982.
   Most of the U.S. lawsuits have been settled and, earlier this
year, the company reached out-of-court settlements with 1,320
British claimants.
   Last month, consumer activist Ralph Nader called for an
international boycott of Lilly to protest the British settlements,
which he said averaged $3,000.
   ``It's just inconceivable in this day and age that after 5{
years of litigation Lilly could settle for so little money,'' Nader
said in February.
   The British lawmakers asked Lilly to set up the trust fund to
bring the British compensation in line with the settlements in the
United States.
   The company has never divulged the amount of the settlements
reached in the U.S. cases, but one Georgia man won a $6 million
judgment against the company.
   ``Suggestions that one U.S. verdict against Lilly is the
standard of settlement of all other U.S. cases are false and
misleading,'' the company said Tuesday in a prepared release.
   ``For third parties now to call for a trust fund for Opren
claimants over and above the recently negotiated settlement is
contrary to the spirit of the entire process,'' the company said.
   ``The concept of a trust fund is unnecessary. The settlement,
which has been endorsed by 98 percent of the claimants, is
appropriate.''
   Richard A. Bailey, managing director of Lilly's United Kingdom
affiliate, said last month that 98 percent of the claimants have
accepted settlement offers, and that the amount of the Opren
settlement was proposed by the claimants' lawyers, and not by the
company.
   Ed West, a spokesman for Lilly, said Tuesday the company had not
received a copy of the lawmakers' letter.

   Unisys Corp., AT&T and NCR Corp. unveiled
computers Tuesday and IBM said it was making a version of the
popular Unix operating system available on its largest mainframes.
   The announcement by International Business Machines Corp. was
another acknowledgment of the growing popularity of Unix, a kind of
internal traffic cop for computers that was invented by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   IBM's version of Unix is called AIX and is now available on
computers ranging from the top of its personal computer line all
the way up to its mainframes. Each computer also has its own
operating system.
   Unisys announced additions to its 1100 family of mainframe
computers. It said the 2200-400 family was a group of mid-range
mainframes offering a four-fold improvement in the amount of
performance for the price along with 70 percent less space, power
and cooling needs.
   The Unisys computers, including some data storage and other
extras, will range in price from $178,000 to $953,000 and will be
available between the end of this year and the second half of 1989.
   NCR introduced the System 10000, which it called a family of
mid-range, multi-user computers ranging in price from $31,000 to
$227,000. All will be available this year. The computers are
intended to have terminals hooked up to them.
   AT&T announced a new personal computer, the 6300 WorkGroup
System, that runs Microsoft Corp.'s DOS operating system. It said
the computer ranges in price from $1,400 to $2,100 and is available
now. AT&T also sells more powerful personal computers ranging in
price up to $10,400.

<HEAD>Executives Seek Faster Registration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business executives testified Tuesday in favor
of proposed revisions in U.S. trademark law that would allow them
to apply for trademark registration before new products are
marketed, as foreign companies are allowed to do.
   Debra Fields, president of Mrs. Fields Inc. of Park City, Utah,
which owns Mrs. Fields Cookies, praised the bill for proposed
elimination of an ``expensive and time-consuming'' requirement that
a trademark be used in interstate commerce before an application
for registration can be filed.
   ``The new law will eliminate expensive business risks which
small businesses can least afford to take,'' she said.
   She noted that small businesses risk losing thousands of dollars
in wasted effort by designing and labeling a trademark for token
marketing of an experimental new product in another state, only to
discover that the trademark already was registered by another
company.
   The bill would allow U.S. citizens to apply for registration of
their trademarks before product plans have been completed.
   ``It's disturbing that U.S. law currently gives foreign
trademark owners an advantage that U.S. businesses do not have,''
DeConcini said.
   The statutory revisions also were endorsed by Ronald R. Kranzow,
vice president of Frito-Lay Inc. of Plano, Texas; C. DeForrest
Trexler, deputy general counsel of Mack Trucks Inc. of Allentown,
Pa., and Herbert A. Hedden, assistant director of the International
Franchise Association.
   The corporate witnesses also supported the bill's provisions for
removing old trademarks that already are being used, and for
prohibiting ``dilution'' of famous trademarks by non-competing
manufacturers.
   As an example of dilution, Trexler cited an instance when a
manufacturer of men's undershorts tried to used the Mack Trucks
bulldog trademark on its products. Such practices are forbidden by
23 states but not under federal law.
   DeConcini said U.S. corporations and business organizations,
including the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, PepsiCo
Inc., Amoco Corp. and Hasbro Inc., also had expressed support for
the first major revisions in trademark law since 1946 to remove
``cumbersome and uneconomical filing procedures.''

<HEAD>Times Mirror, Partnership Plan Cable TV Swap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Co. said it has agreed with a
partnership of United Artists Communications Inc. and
Tele-Communications Inc. to swap cable televison systems in several
states.
   Neither Times Mirror nor the partnership put a value on the deal
Tuesday, but analysts estimated it would be worth about $740
million, based on an average price of $2,000 per subscriber.
   The companies had announced tentative plans for the exchange in
early October, but the details weren't worked out until now, Times
Mirror said.
   Times Mirror will turn over to the partnership cable systems
serving about 185,000 customers in the Arizona communities of
Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, Paradise Valley, Fountain Hills,
Nogales, Bullhead City, Casa Grande and Lake Havasu.
   In exchange, Times Mirror will receive systems with a similar
number of subscribers in Taunton and North Attleboro, Mass.;
Brookhaven, N.Y.; Decatur, Ill.; Zanesville, Ohio; Reno and Carson
City, Nev.; and South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
   Times Mirror also agreed that it will acquire the Rock Island,
Ill., cable system of Tele-Communications for an undisclosed price.
That also was part of the October tentative agreement.
   The systems being received by the partnership are in areas of
projected high growth, while the systems being received by Times
Mirror largely are in areas whose subscribership is expected to
remain relatively stable but whose cash flow exceeds the industry
average.
   Tele-Communications and United Artists, both based in Denver,
are the nation's largest and third-largest cable TV operators, with
5.5 million and 2.3 million subscribers, respectively.
   Times Mirror, based in Los Angeles, is a media conglomerate
whose flagship is the Los Angeles Times newspaper. It has about
870,000 cable subscribers.

<TEXT>
   The Conservative government unveiled on Tuesday a
sweeping reform of the British tax system, slashing rates for
higher income groups in a move that provoked an uproar from the
parliamentary opposition.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government also announced a
$5.55 billion budget surplus, the country's first in almost 20
years.
   ``Shame, shame!'' and ``Rich man's budget!'' opposition members
shouted as Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presented the
annual spring budget statement to Parliament.
   A Scottish legislator, Alec Salmond, was expelled after he
called the budget an ``obscenity'' with tax cuts instead of extra
spending on health and welfare services.
   The budget served notice that in her third consecutive term as
prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher's faith in her 9-year-old capitalist
revolution is undimmed, and that the socialist opposition can
expect few concessions.
   Lawson said the government would abolish four income tax
brackets, leaving just two, of 25 percent and 40 percent, in the
fiscal year beginning April 1.
   Tax rates currently range from 27 percent to 60 percent.
   Lawson's statement was repeatedly disrupted by opposition
lawmakers, especially when he announced a huge tax cut to 40
percent for top earners.
   ``Tax breaks for the rich, poll tax (a new property tax) for the
poor and nothing in it for the health service _ it's an absolute
and utter obscenity!'' shouted Salmond, of the Scottish National
Party.
   A few minutes later, the deputy speaker of the House of Commons
was forced to suspend proceedings as shouting continued. Four
uniformed nurses were ousted from the public gallery for yelling at
Lawson.
   Custom dictates a respectful hearing of budget statements, but
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock described Lawson's budget as a
``tragedy.''
   ``This is puny, marginal and negligible for the average people
in our society,'' he said.
   He claimed the surplus came from Britain's North Sea oil sales,
taxes on a ``massive expansion'' of household credit debt, and
``the once-and-for-all sell-off of national assets'' _ a reference
to the sale of state-owned industries to the private sector.
   But Lawson said: ``This major reform will leave us with one of
the simplest systems of income tax in the world.''
   The proposed tax changes are part of Mrs. Thatcher's long-term
overhaul of the tax system and resemble recent reforms in the
United States and Canada.
   Mrs. Thatcher's goals have been to reduce and simplify taxes and
transfer the tax burden from income to spending.
   Financial markets were buoyed by the statement with the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closing up 20.4
points at 1,839.9.
   The pound moved hiher, but its advance was checkedby reported
intervention by the Bank of England, dealers said.
   The spring Budget Day is when the government announces how it
will raise its revenue. The government last autumn announced its
planned expenditures of $290 billion for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1989.
   The budget proposals must be approved by Parliament, where the
Tories' 102-seat majority in the 650-seat House of Commons
guarantees their passage.
   Lawson told the House that the public service borrowing
requirement, the most commonly used measure of Britain's budget
deficit, would be in surplus of $5.55 billion in the year ending
March 31, when the government spent $273 billion.
   It was only the second surplus since the early 1950s. The last,
in 1968-69, was about $1.1 billion.
   The government most recently had forecast a deficit for the
current year of $1.85 billion, down from an original forecast of
$7.4 billion.
   Lawson also said he plans for a similar surplus in the new
fiscal year.
   ``Having achieved it, I intend to stick to it,'' he said.
   The focus of the statement was on tax reform, however, with
Lawson saying he planned ultimately to lower the 25-percent tax
rate to 20 percent.
   Under the new system, the higher 40 percent rate will apply to
income above $35,705. Currently the 27-percent rate applies to
income up to $33,115, and the top rate of 60 percent is on income
above $76,220.
   In her first budget, in June 1979, Mrs. Thatcher cut the top
rate from 83 percent to 60 percent. The lowest rate stood at 33
percent in 1979.

   The dollar gained against most major currencies
Tuesday in reaction to weakness in the British pound. Gold prices
also rose.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $446 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $441.90 an ounce late Monday.
   The British pound rose sharply during a budget announcement by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who announced Britain's
first budget surplus in nearly 20 years and a sweeping tax reform.
   Later, though, the pound fell back as investors cashed in on
paper profits and word that the Bank of England was selling
sterling to stem its rise.
   As sterling fell, the dollar benefited, said Frank Conte, vice
president for foreign exchange in the New York office of Barclays
Bank PLC.
   Gold and silver strengthened in a speculative run-up. Traders
said the peg for gold's rise was word of increased tension between
the United States and Panama.
   In late London trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.8570,
down from $1.8575 Monday. Later, in New York, the pound was quoted
at $1.8455, down from $1.8540.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in Europe, the
dollar rose 0.02 yen to a closing 127.25. Later in London, the
dollar was quoted at 127.10 yen. At the end of the trading day in
New York, the dollar rose to 127.38 yen from 126.78 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates late Tuesday in New York, compared with late
Monday, included: 1.6699 West German marks, up from 1.6629; 1.3805
Swiss francs, up from 1.3718; 1.2539 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2572; 5.6660 French francs, up from 5.6395; and 1,237.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,231.25.
   Other dollar rates late Tuesday in Europe, compared with late
Monday, included: 1.6650 West German marks, up from 1.6645; 1.3760
Swiss francs, up from 1.3693; 5.6605 French francs, up from 5.6375;
1.8705 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8645; 1,232.40 Italian lire, up
from 1,227.87; and 1.2564 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2577.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $443.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $441.00. In Zurich, the late bid price
was $442.50, up from $441.50 late Monday. On the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at $446.30,
up from $441.90 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.54 to close at a bid of
$443.27 an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London Tuesday at a bid price of $6.25 a
troy ounce, up from Monday's $6.22. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery was bid at $6.365 an ounce, up from
$6.24 late Monday.

<HEAD>Domestic Car and Truck Sales Up 6.3 Percent in Early March From
1987</HEAD>

   Led by a generous jump in purchases of Ford Motor
Co. vehicles, sales of domestic cars and light trucks rose 6.3
percent in early March from a year ago, automakers reported Tuesday.
   Industry-leader General Motors Corp., however, did not share the
strong sales increases enjoyed by No. 2 Ford and incentive-heavy
Chrysler Corp.
   ``I'm surprised how strong sales were considering that some
consumers had moved their (March) purchases into February in
expectation of sales incentives expiring,'' said industry analyst
Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Ford's combined domestic car and light truck sales were the
highest for early March since 1979, Ford said.
   Ford's domestic car sales jumped 21.4 percent to 68,859 in early
March from 50,407 a year ago. Ford held 32.5 percent of the
domestic car market, up from 27.7 percent a year ago.
   Ford's light truck sales rose 18.1 percent to 46,073 in early
March from 34,685 a year ago. Ford's share of that market improved
to 39.5 percent from 37.4 percent a year ago.
   Despite its incentives, GM's domestic car sales fell 13 percent
from early March a year ago and its light truck sales dropped 1.5
percent, GM reported.
   Glantz and other analysts blamed the end-of-February expiration
date of most of GM's incentive programs for its strong February
showing and ensuing weakness in early March.
   GM later extended the buyer lures into the spring, but only
after many consumers had hurried to take advantage of the discounts
before they ended. At the same time, Ford sweetened its incentives
in early March, helping its sales.
   The eight companies that build cars and trucks in the United
States sold 328,437 in the nine selling days from March 1-10, up
from 274,626 in eight days a year ago.
   Sales have improved in each of the seven sales period so far in
1988 compared with the first quarter of 1987, when showrooms were
empty because buyers made their pre-tax reform purchases at the end
of 1986.
   The percentage that sales fell or increased is a comparison of
average daily sales during the period, not of the straight numbers
of vehicles sold in early March this year and last year.
   Automakers sold 211,772 domestic cars in early March, up 3.5
percent from 181,820 a year ago, and 116,665 light trucks, up 11.7
percent from 92,806 a year ago.
   Despite the addition of new mid-size models, GM's domestic car
sales fell to 95,372 from 97,487 a year ago. GM's light truck sales
fell slightly to 42,489, or 4,721 a day, from 38,327, or 4,790 a
day, in early March 1987.
   GM's share of the domestic car market fell nearly 9 percentage
points in early March to 45 percent from 53.6 percent a year ago.
GM lost nearly 5 points of share in the light truck market at 36.4
percent, down from 41.3 percent ago year ago.
   Sales of Chrysler domestic cars rose 18.3 percent to 34,667 from
26,046 a year ago. Sales of Chrysler domestic light trucks jumped
24.1 percent to 25,287 from 18,108 a year ago.
   The No. 3 automaker held 16.4 percent of the domestic car
market, up from 14.3 percent a year ago, and 21.7 percent of the
light truck market, up from 19.5 percent a year ago.
   Together, the Big Three held 93.9 percent of the domestic car
market, down from 95.7 percent a year ago, and 97.6 percent of the
light truck market, down from 98.2 percent in early March 1987.
   Among the remaining companies, leader Honda Motor Co. reported a
71.9 percent jump in sales of cars built at its Marysville, Ohio,
factory. Toyota Motor Corp. domestic car sales rose 97.3 percent.
   Nissan Motor Corp. domestic car sales fell 19.7 percent from a
year ago but its domestic truck sales rose 48.5 percent. Volkswagen
of America's domestic car sales dropped 18.6 percent.

   Stock prices showed little enthusiasm in either
direction Tuesday as the market drifted in a quiet, lackluster
session.
   Analysts said investors bided time while awaiting economic news
due later in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2.66 points
to 2,047.41.
   But advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 789 up, 718 down and 477 unchanged.
   Big Board volume was 133.17 million shares, up slightly from
131.89 million shares in the previous session, which marked the
lightest total since Dec. 29.
   Analysts said market watchers were taking note of the light
volume. ``Right now it's telling us nobody cares,'' said Ronald B.
Doran, head of institutional trading at First Albany Corp.
   He said there was a ``boycott'' by both institutional and retail
investors who are ``waiting for some flow of economic news to get
cranked up.''
   The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise
trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first ``triple
witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock
indexes will expire simultaneously.
   While concern over the two events dampened activity in the
previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants
may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the
witching hour might have.
   Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade
figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the
past couple of witching hours have been rather uneventful with the
adoption of new procedures designed to spread the impact of
last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.
   The transportation sector managed to post a clear, positive
trend. Airline stocks rose across the board amid reports that a
number of carriers plan to tighten restrictions on discount fares.
Allegis rose 1\ to 79{, AMR rose ~ to 41~, Delta was up 1[ to 47],
and NWA Inc. was up | to 43{.
   First RepublicBank fell \ to 1{. Texas' largest bank holding
company said it might seek a federal bailout.
   Traders complained that the technology sector failed to help
establish a positive trend for the day. IBM fell 1{ to 114 and
Digital Equipment fell 2{ to 116\.
   Auto stocks were off slightly. Chrysler was down [ to 24\, Ford
was down \ to 44 and General Motors was unchanged. The major
automakers reported mixed results for the early March sales period.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market decreased $834 million, or 0.03
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 157.59 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.07 to 149.99.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.66 to 308.55,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.24 to 266.13.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.19
to 296.75. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 376.55, off 0.12.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures moved higher Tuesday, with gold prices
approaching recent highs.
   While there was little on the world financial or political scene
to account for the strength, the move put gold in a position to
break out of its trading range, analysts said.
   On other markets, pork belly futures took a nosedive, grains and
soybeans were mixed and crude oil was a little higher.
   ``The price action of gold was very good, but it came out of
left field,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``There wasn't any real news; no action
in the other markets that would warrant it.''
   However, he noted that the gold contract for delivery in April
reached a high of $448.30 an ounce at the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   ``This is very close to the highs that were made during a recent
consolidation phase were it traded between $440 and $450,'' he
said. Prices had dropped into the mid $420s last month.
   Sloane said prices are not likely to break beyond $450 on
Wednesday, one day ahead of the release of the January balance of
trade data.
   ``But whenever it gets this close to the top of the range, you
have to treat it with some respect,'' he said.
   ``Metals have made a nice recovery from the lows of a few weeks
ago,'' said Sloane. ``They're well positioned to make a nice move.
If we do get favorable trade data, prices have almost no where to
go but to break out.''
   Gold settled $4.40 to $5.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in April at $447.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 12.5
cents higher with March at $6.365 a troy ounce.
   Pork belly futures retreated sharply at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange under data indicating there may be burdensome supplies in
the summer.
   ``Bellies collapsed late in the day following a report of a big
movement into storage,'' said Philip Stanley, an anlayst in Chicago
with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   He said 3.7 million pounds of pork bellies were stored during
the week ended March 12.
   ``This was at the top end of expectations,'' said Stanley.
   Prices could rebound if the market comes to believe there's
going to be a need for a lot of bellies, he said, but right now
it's concerned about the ramifications for an oversupply later this
summer.
   Cattle futures were weakened by profit taking, said Stanley.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with the
April contract at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent
lower to .32 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live
hogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower with April at 45.20 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.32 cents lower
with March at 52.62 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   It was a sluggish session with little price movement in either
direction.
   ``This is the reflection of the indecisiveness of the market
today in these slow conditions,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``There was no news overnight to
move prices either way.
   Wheat was \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for
delivery in March settling at $2.95 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower
to } cent higher with March at $1.98 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 3\ cents lower with March at $1.88{ a bushel; and soybeans were
1 cent lower to { cent higher with March at $6.13} a bushel.
   Crude oil futures moved a little higher, but the market remained
confused and cautious, said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York
with Elders Futures Inc.
   ``People are waiting for OPEC to say `We've got a problem,' and
deal with it, or for prices to simply go lower,'' he said.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil was 9 cents higher with the April contract at $15.68 a
barrel; heating oil was .06 cent lower to .13 cent higher with
April at 43.47 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent
lower to .02 cent higher with April at 44.38 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Desert Partners Mounts Proxy Fight for Directors' Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners L.P. has begun a
soliciting proxies from shareholders for the election of
directorships of USG Corp., which recently spurned an unsolicited
$1.9 billion buyout offer from the investor group.
   Desert Partners, the company's largest shareholder with 9.8
percent of the stock, is fielding a rival slate for the six seats
at stake in the upcoming election. USG has 15 directors.
   Earlier this month, USG rejected Desert Partners' $42-a-share
buyout offer and said it was considering defense strategies that
might include the sale of a major block of USG stock to a third
party to block an unfriendly takeover.
   The proxy battle by Desert Partners, which is headed by Texas
oilmen Jack E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr., will climax May 11 at
USG's annual meeting in its headquarters city of Chicago.
   USG's stock closed at $35.87{ a share, down 25 cents in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Desert Partners said in its proxy statement that even if it wins
all six seats, it still would not control the building materials
company.
   ``However, a vote in favor of the election of the Desert
Partners nominees should indicate your support for the offer,'' the
proxy statement read.
   Shareholders will receive two proxy statements, one from the
company and the other from Desert Partners.
