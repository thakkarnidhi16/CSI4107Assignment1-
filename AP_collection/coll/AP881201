<HEAD>Blood Bank Held Responsible for Transfusion-Related AIDS Case</HEAD>

   A jury found a blood bank negligent Thursday
for improperly screening its blood in the case of a 5{-year-old boy
who contracted AIDS through a transfusion, a verdict believed to be
the first of its kind, lawyers said.
   ``We just feel this is a great moral victory. I think the blood
industry, particularly in high-risk areas like San Francisco, has
got to shape up,'' said Mary Osborn, whose son, Michael, was the
plaintiff in the case.
   Michael, who has a brain tumor and lymphoma, was diagnosed with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in September 1987. He has only a
few months to live, said the Osborns' lawyer, Michael Moriarty.
   ``At least Michael will be around in some way in the future. At
least his name will not be forgotten,'' added Mrs. Osborn.
   The jury found Irwin Memorial Blood Bank of San Francisco, which
supplies blood to about 40 hospitals, to be negligent in failing to
screen the blood adequately, although some AIDS screening was done
at the facility at the time.
   In addition, the jury ruled that the blood bank erred in not
allowing family members to target their blood donations for Michael.
   Moriarty said the blood bank had rejected requests by the boy's
family and friends to donate blood for the transfusion, saying they
had no policy to accommodate such requests when in fact they did.
   The blood bank's attorney, Duncan Barr, denied that the blood
bank acted negligently and said the decision will be appealed.
   The jury awarded the Sacramento family $550,000 in compensatory
damages. The child, suffering from a congenital heart defect,
received the transfusion Feb. 24, 1983, when he was three weeks old.
The boy's parents were awarded $200,000 to pay for past and future
medical bills but were denied any damages for pain and suffering.
   The jury voted unanimously to award the damages and split 9-3 on
the question of liability, said Moriarty.
   Defending Irwin's decisions in the case, Barr said in 1983 the
blood bank had a policy of allowing so-called directed donors only
for medical reasons, such as blood donations from organ donors.
   Barr and Dr. Thomas Asher, founder and chairman of HemaCare
Corp., a private blood bank in Sherman Oaks, said the case was the
first time a blood bank was found responsible for a
transfusion-related AIDS case.
   A Denver jury in June cleared a blood bank of liability in the
case of a woman who contracted AIDS through a transfusion. A similar
case in California in 1986 ended in a settlement before the trial
ended.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Opposition Paper Says Ortega Wants To Meet With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega wants to meet
with Mikhail Gorbachev during the Soviet Union leader's visit to
U.N. headquarters in New York, the opposition daily La Prensa
reported Wednesday.
   Ortega asked the U.S. Embassy for more than 20 visas for his
entourage, La Prensa said in its afternoon edition.
   Nicaraguan government sources told The Associated Press they were
unable to confirm the visa request because Ortega has been in Mexico
since Sunday. He is in Mexico to attend the inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Thursday.
   La Prensa said that Ortega plans to leave for the United States
next weekend, shortly after returning from Mexico.
   ``It is not known if Gorbachev's tight schedule in New York
includes a visit with Ortega,'' La Prensa said.
   Gorbachev plans to meet with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush on Dec. 5.
   ``Political observers and diplomats'' said Ortega's trip
indicated ``Sandinista concern about possible negotiation between
the two powers regarding Soviet presence in Nicaragua,'' La Prensa
said.
   In a separate editorial, La Prensa said that ``for Gorbachev to
develop his perestroika ... he must seek better relations with the
United States.''
   ``Here is where Nicaragua enters the picture,'' the paper said.
``The Sandinistas with their politics of alignment toward the Soviet
Union have put Nicaragua into the field of the East-West fight,
making a place for itself in the agenda for any dialogue between the
superpowers.... Ortega's potential trip to New York confirms that.''
   The paper also said, ``Ortega runs to the United Nations,
undoubtedly to seek concessions from the Soviet delegation.''
   Perestroika, Russian for restructuring, refers to Gorbachev's
program for reforming Soviet economy and society for efficiency.

<HEAD>Human Ancestors Used Fire Up to 1.5 Million Years Ago, Study
Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they have found the
earliest direct evidence for use of fire by ape-men or early humans,
bone fragments that were burned as long as 1.5 million years ago.
   Fires were apparently a regular event in the South African cave
where the fragments were found, although it is unclear whether they
were for cooking, warmth or scaring predators, scientists said.
   ``We're not absolutely certain those bones were there (in fire)
because they were food remains,'' said researcher Andrew Sillen.
``They could have been thrown into the fire as kind of a refuse
heap.''
   Sillen, of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and C.K.
Brain of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria, South Africa, describe
their analysis in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The fires may have been set by ancestors of humans called Homo
erectus, or by ape-men called Australopithecus robustus, which are
not direct human ancestors, they wrote.
   In an interview, Sillen said the bone fragments could be 1
million to 1.5 million years old, but most likely they are 1.2
million years old.
   Previous research suggests fire was being used in Kenya a bit
more recently than 1.4 million years ago, a date many experts accept
but with some hesitancy, said Eric Delson, professor of anthropology
at Lehman College of the City University of New York.
   That research is supported by indirect evidence, magnetic
irregularities in the ground thought caused by ancient fire on the
surface, he said in a telephone interview.
   The evidence from the new study is ``certainly the strongest to
date in favor of early human-controlled fire,'' Delson said.
   Other research suggests fire was used slightly less than 500,000
years ago in Hungary, France and China, and certainly less than
150,000 years ago in Africa and Europe, he said.
   In the new work, researchers used bones recovered from South
Africa's Swartkrans cave, well-known for providing remains of Homo
erectus and the ape-man robustus.
   To make sure they could identify signs of ancient burning,
researchers took a fresh leg bone from a South African antelope
called a hartebeest, and heated bone slices to different
temperatures.
   Then they used the chemical and microscopic characteristics found
in the heated slices to analyze the fossils. They concluded that 270
fossil fragments had been burnt, with most identifiable ones from
antelope.
   Fragments from zebra, warthog, baboon and a finger bone of
robustus were also identified. The robustus bone does not
necessarily mean an ape-man was eaten, since the purpose of the
fires is unknown, Sillen said.
   The fragments' color and structure showed they had been heated to
a range of temperatures similar to that recorded in experimental
campfires set by Brain. The experimental fires used what was
probably the most common wood in the vicinity in ancient days,
Sillen said.
   In the interview, Sillen said no burnt bones were found in older
sections of the cave even though the conditions for deposition of
fossils were identical. That suggests the burnt fragments mark the
beginning of the use of fire, he said.
   Delson said the idea that the fragments burned in natural fires
rather than deliberate blazes cannot be ruled out. But Randall
Susman, a researcher at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook who has studied the ancient inhabitants of the Swartkrans
cave, said he believes the fires were deliberate.
   ``It's highly unlikely that these bones would have been burned in
a naturally occuring situation,'' he said. Range fires would not
have reached the campfire-like temperatures identified for the bone
fragments, he said.
   In addition, Homo erectus was known to use fire elsewhere, he
said.
   Homo erectus appeared about 1.6 million years ago and evolved
into a more advanced form by about 250,000 years ago. Robustus
appeared about 2.5 million years ago and survived until at least 1
million years ago before extinction.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Eddie Murphy has bought Cher's
four-acre Moroccan-style canyon estate for about $6 million.
   The Benedict Canyon home has six bedrooms, 7{ bathrooms, two
maids quarters, 10 fireplaces, a granite kitchen, pool, spa, gym and
atrium with electronic skylight, according to the listing with the
Alvarez, Hyland & Young real estate firm.
   ``He has purchased it,'' confirmed Murphy publicist Terry
Williams, who said Wednesday she couldn't provide any details on the
sale.
   Cher's publicist, Lisa Kasteler, also said the house was sold to
Murphy, but wouldn't elaborate.
   Ms. Williams said Murphy wanted homes on both coasts. The
actor-comedian has a home in New Jersey, and usually stays at the
L'Ermitage Hotel in Beverly Hills when in the Los Angeles area, she
said.
   The two-story Santa Monica Mountains home, 20 miles northwest of
downtown, was listed for $6.5 million and reportedly sold for about
$6 million.
   A few miles away in Holmby Hills, the home owned by actor Burt
Reynolds was re-listed with Elaine Young of Alvarez, Hyland & Young.
Reynolds and wife Loni Anderson have moved to Florida and he's
``anxious to sell,'' she said.
   The $6 million asking price includes a 15,000-square-foot,
three-bedroom Mediterranean-style main house with four bars, a
tennis court and two spacious guest houses, said Ms. Young.
   Reynolds bought the home from Dan Rowan, who bought it from
George Harrison, said Ms. Young. She described the walled estate as
``the perfect bachelor or couple house in the country's most
exclusive neighborhood.''
   Neighbors include Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.

<HEAD>Mercury Astronaut Says U.S. Lags in Space Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wally M. Schirra, one of the first seven
Mercury astronauts, says the United States no longer leads the world
in space technology and should renew its commitment to space
exploration.
   In an address at the U.S. Naval Academy Tuesday night, the former
Navy captain called on the Bush administration to make building a
space station the top priority of America's space program.
   Such a station could serve as a port for manned and unmanned
exploratory missions to other planets and their moons, said Schirra,
65.
   Schirra, a 1946 academy graduate who is now a business executive,
wore a ``Beat Army'' pin _ the same message he carried on a placard
during a 1965 Gemini mission. The annual Army-Navy football game is
this weekend.
   Schirra said the Skylab project marked the beginning of the
decline of the U.S. space program. Budget cuts forced the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to allow Skylab to break up in
orbit and no serious financial commitment has been made since, he
said.
   The former astronaut, speaking on the eve of the launching of the
secret military shuttle Atlantis, said space shuttle missions have
had ``no place to go. ...They were just supposed to go into outer
space and come home. We did that 25 years ago.''
   Schirra praised the Soviet Union's space program for its
long-range goals. The Soviets have done extensive research on how
weightlessness affects humans and have worked to develop ships that
can stay in orbit for years, but the United States has attempted
neither, he said.
   Schirra was selected as a Mercury astronaut in April 1959. In
1962, he became the fifth astronaut to fly in space.

<TEXT>
   Tehran is a city full of contrasts, showing the
effects of war, tradition and modern lifestyles. An Associated Press
correspondent accompanied West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on a recent visit, and here is his report:

<TEXT>
   In the bustle of Tehran's main bazaar, young
women wearing blue jeans under their traditional Islamic chador
robes stroll past crippled war veterans hobbling on rickety wooden
crutches between merchant stalls.
   A few blocks away, curious children and young people flock to
gaze at the magnificent former residence of the late Shah of Iran.
   Some people on the streets of Tehran openly indicated their
displeasure with Iran's revolutionary government, which toppled the
shah in 1979.
   A book vendor asked for an up-to-date city guidebook told a
Western reporter, ``There has been nothing like that since the
revolution.''
   The merchant then held up a tattered guidebook dating back before
the Islamic revolution. She pointed to a photograph in the book of
the shah's family. The picture had been crossed out with thick black
censorship marks.
   ``It really is a shame,'' the book vendor said angrily.
   Journalists accompanying West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher to Tehran were not allowed to tour the city
freely or take pictures during the three-day state visit that ended
Tuesday.
   But the glimpses they were allowed showed Tehran is a city full
of contrasts. The Westerners witnessed clear evidence of Moslem
fundamentalism, but also signs of modernism.
   Iran has been making efforts to increase its contacts with some
Western nations, such as West Germany, as it tries to recover from
its crippling eight-year war with Iraq after a cease-fire.
   But West German businessmen who accompanied Genscher to Tehran
said it is still not certain whether Iran's commitment to
conservative Moslem principles will hinder efforts to build up the
country.
   ``Whoever plans to invest here must carefully weigh each step,''
said Rochus-Ernst Freiherr von Luettwitz, a West German involved in
business discussions with Iran.
   There are signs everywhere that a fundamentalist Islamic
philosophy that has governed life in Iran since the shah's ouster
still holds sway.
   Iranian Revolutionary Guards carrying automatic rifles were
plainly visible on Tehran's streets, watching the Western
journalists to make sure they did not violate any of the
restrictions under which their presence was permitted.
   The Iranian government's disdain for the late shah, who was
friendly with the United States, becomes bitterly clear with a visit
to the grand palace where he and his family had lived.
   Pictures of the shah have been turned upside-down inside the
rooms of the palace, now a museum. Photographs showing poverty and
squalor during the shah's rule have been placed near tables
exhibiting valuables once owned by the former ruler.
   Plaques tell visitors the purpose of rooms in the palace during
the shah's reign, but in a belittling fashion.
   ``Former Working Room of the Shah Who Fled,'' reads one plaque.
   But along with such clear evidence of Moslem fundamentalism,
there are also signs Tehran's people do not totally reject Western
ways.
   Many of Tehran's young women wear blue jeans or short skirts
under their traditional black chador robes, the fabric pushed back
just enough on their foreheads to reveal a lock or two of hair.
   Several young women were also wearing high-heeled shoes.
   Tehran residents on the streets did not stare at the Western
visitors but actually seemed to welcome them.
   There were also signs of the devastating war with Iraq. Crippled
young men hobbled along the streets and the Westerners saw empty
lots where they were told bombed-out homes once stood.
   There are also signs of stymied progress within Tehran.
   Just behind the Hotel Esteghlal, called the Royal Tehran Hilton
before the 1979 revolution, chickens raced among building materials
at the site of an uncompleted structure. Rusty steel girders were
scattered on the ground, giving the impression the structure had not
been worked on for some time.
   Inside the hotel itself, the climate-control system was able to
churn out only humid blasts of air.
   Genscher and his entourage were greeted with open arms by Iranian
officials.
   But Western journalists were told through the West German Embassy
that while in Iran they would be permitted to write only about
Genscher's meetings and that their visas were valid only for the
duration of the official visit.
   In addition, it was made clear to Western photographers that the
Iranians would not allow pictures to be taken of life on Tehran's
streets.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Wednesday it
will not be a scapegoat for what it calls politically motivated
opposition in the Philippines to a nuclear power plant it built
under former President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino says the $2.3 billion plant
60 miles northwest of Manila in Bataan province is unsafe in part
because of its design and its location on an earthquake fault near a
volcano.
   Her government has said it plans to sue Westinghouse for damages
and breach of contract regarding the plant, which never went into
operation because of alleged safety defects.
   Her legal adviser, Adolfo Azcuna, said in late October that a
lawsuit was ready and likely would be filed within a month in the
United States. An agreement barring either the government or the
company from taking legal action was due to expire Thursday.
   Formal announcement of the lawsuit was scheduled Thursday in
Manila for 2:30 p.m. (1:30 a.m. EST) at the presidential palace.
   ``What we're finding here are the results of a political policy
that came to life when they were running for office,'' said
Nathaniel D. Woodson, general manager of the Westinghouse nuclear
fuels unit. ``They now feel they have a political albatross around
their neck and they're trying to blame us.''
   The reactor's opponents also allege that bribes were paid over
the awarding of the prime contract. ``We won fairly and squarly,''
Woodson said in an interview.
   Woodson and Deputy General Counsel Louis J. Briskman said that
Philippines officials have acknowledged during private talks that no
matter how safe the plant is, they don't intend to allow nuclear
power production in the country.
   ``Safety has nothing to do with it,'' Woodson said.
   With all but $20 million to $30 million still due from Manila for
the power plant, Westinghouse could walk away from the 10-year-old
controversy, said Woodson. The bigger risk perhaps is damage to the
company's international standing as a designer and builder of
nuclear power plants.
   ``All over the world we have built plants, and we haven't had
this problem. If they don't want to operate this plant, that's
they're decision, but don't make Westinghouse a scapegoat,'' he
said. ``Westinghouse will not be a scapegoat.''
   The company cited investigations by the U.S. Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission that produced no evidence
warranting charges.
   Further, a safety study commissioned by the Aquino government
concluded that the plant is safe, Westinghouse said. A trade journal
published a draft of that report. The government says the final
report concludes otherwise, but officials have refused to release
the document.
   The 620-megawatt plant, powered by a Westinghouse-pressurized
water reactor, was completed three years ago.
   In its early stages, the project was shaken by allegations of
kickbacks to officials of the Marcos regime and by safety concerns.
   Communist rebels have bombed transmission towers leading from the
plant, and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap. The
plant's corps of operators has largely disbanded, and Westinghouse
has only a handful of employees still in the Philippines, Woodson
said.
   Yet the cost of the plant continues rising, Westinghouse said.
Interest on the loans the Philippines took to build cost an
estimated $300,000 per day.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright on Wednesday called
for George Bush to quickly present Congress with an ``honest and
responsible'' budget, saying the president-elect has a duty to spell
out in detail his plan for attacking the country's deficit problems.
   Wright joined a chorus of witnesses before the National Economic
Commission who urged quick and decisive action on the part of the
new administration and Congress to break the seven-year deadlock
over huge budget deficits.
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who also testified,
said that failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence by
foreigners in the value of the dollar, sparking higher interest
rates and possibly a severe recession in this country.
   ``We are, entirely unnecessarily in my view, undercutting the
economic foundation of United States world leadership,'' Volcker
said.
   Wright said Bush should submit his own spending blueprint no
later than mid-February and this should be followed by the
recommendations of the economic commission by March 1.
   ``We do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule,'' Wright
said. ``The problems won't wait indefinitely while people try to
read our lips or read our minds.''
   Wright and other Democrats want to force Bush to be specific on
how he would cut the deficit without raising taxes while still
keeping his other campaign promises to boost spending in such areas
as education, day care and environmental cleanup.
   They fear that unless the president-elect is forced to spell out
how his spending cuts would work, Bush will try later to blame
Congress for boosting taxes while ignoring his ``flexible freeze''
approach.
   Bush said last week he intends to appoint people to begin deficit
negotiations with Congress on his first day in office, but he has
not said whether he will submit his own spending plan or simply use
President Reagan's final budget as the starting point for
discussions.
   Wright said if Bush did not want to submit a separate budget then
Reagan should consider allowing Bush to incorporate his own
recommendations into the administration's 1990 budget, which Reagan
will submit on Jan. 9.
   ``This would be an act of smooth transition and the kind of
resolute leadership which could inspire greater confidence both from
the public and from financial markets at home and abroad,'' Wright
said.
   Volcker, in his testimony, sounded many of the same warnings as
his successor at the Fed, Alan Greenspan. In testimomy before the
commission two weeks ago, Greenspan said the deficit had begun to
``eat away at the foundations of our economic strength, and the need
to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent.''
   Volcker said since the current economic recovery began in late
1982 the country has been on a consumption binge, fueled by the huge
budget deficits and large flows of foreign capital into the country.
   To keep foreigners from losing confidence in the U.S. economy,
Volcker said the government needed to launch a credible deficit
reduction program that would bring the deficit down by between $30
billion to $40 billion each year until the budget reaches surplus.
The deficit in the last fiscal year was $155.1 billion.
   Volcker said he would favor using a gasoline tax to raise extra
revenues, saying each 1-cent-per-gallon boost in the tax raises $1
billion annually in new revenues. This tax would promote
conservation, Volcker said, thus reducing U.S. dependence on foreign
oil and helping to trim America's huge trade deficits.
   The Council on Competitiveness, composed of 157 chief executives
from business, organized labor and higher education, presented the
commission with a list of proposals to trim the deficit by $120
billion by 1993 with a combination of spending cuts and $48 billion
in higher taxes.
   Among the taxes the council suggested were a boost in excise
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, which would raise $8 billion
annually; a 20-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, which
would raise $20 billion annually; and higher income tax rates for
families earning more than $220,350 a year, which could bring in $7
billion in additional revenues, the council said.
   Former Rep. Robert Giaimo, D-Conn., and co-chairman of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said a nationwide series
of town meetings had shown him that Americans support balancing the
budget, even it means tax increases and a freeze in cost-of-living
hikes for Social Security.
   Charles Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, presented
the commission with a GAO transition report which came to the
conclusion that Bush's flexible freeze would not be enough to
eliminate the deficit and consideration would have to be given to
increasing taxes.
   ``When the long-term health of our nation's economy is at stake,
everything must be negotiable, including defense spending,
entitlements and taxes,'' Bowsher said.
   Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen has
registered his objections to proposals by the White House's Office
of Management and Budget to cut Medicaid payments to states next
year and to reduce the growth in spending on AIDS.
   In a letter Bowen wrote to OMB Director Joseph R. Wright Jr.,
reported in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post, the
secretary called the Medicaid proposal ``unrealistic.''
   OMB wants to slash federal Medicaid payments to states by $1.1
billion, and to allow AIDS spending to grow from $1.3 billion to
$1.6 billion. Bowen wants the government to spend $1.9 billion on
AIDS.

   A soldier went berserk after a quarrel
with his girlfriend, firing a rifle at neighbors and villagers and
killing seven people, the military said today.
   The killer surrendered after the rampage, in which nine people
were injured, the military said.
   The report said Jesus Negro, a constable at the Special Action
Force, went on the killing spree after he left his girlfriend's home
Wednesday in Tiber, a village in Cebu province 360 miles southeast
of Manila.
   The military said the violence was triggered by a ``love
problem'' between Negro and the woman, who was not identified.
   After Negro left his girlfriend's home, he began firing his
semiautomatic rifle at neighbors in the coastal village. Five people
were killed and five others injured, the report said.
   Negro then hitched a ride in a jeep to nearby Talisay town. While
en route, he opened fire on a group of men in Lawaan village,
killing two and wounding four, the report added.
   He surrendered later and was undergoing interrogation, the report
said.

<HEAD>General Assembly Deplores U.S. For Denying Arafat A Visa</HEAD>

   The General Assembly voted 151-2 to condemn
the United States for not letting Yasser Arafat enter the country
and gave it until today to reverse the decision. U.S. officials said
they would not budge.
   If Arafat, the PLO chairman, is not granted a U.S. visa, Arab
nations will offer a resolution to reconvene the General Assembly in
Geneva so Arafat can address it. Diplomats said passage was assured.
   The United States and Israel opposed Wednesday's condemnation.
Britain abstained because it said the criticism was too harsh, but
all other U.S. allies supported the denunciation.
   The vote was conducted in a rare and dramatic roll call,
requested by Jordan.
   In a departure from the standard electronic voting, delegates
voted in the official U.N. languages: Arabic, English, Chinese,
French, Russian and Spanish. They called out ``Na'm,'' ``Yes,''
``Zan Cheng,'' ``0ui,'' ``Da,'' ``Si,'' and in the case of Israel
and the United States, ``No.''
   Absent from the roll call were Dominica, Grenada, Paraguay, St.
Kitts, Nevis, and South Africa.
   The resolution asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to inform the General Assembly by tonight of the U.S.
response. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the United States
would not change its mind.
   The State Department denied Arafat a visa on security grounds,
saying he condones and encourages terrorism perpetrated by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Arafat had said he wanted to explain to the General Assembly the
position taken by the Palestine National Council in its recent
meeting in Algiers. The council _ the PLO's parliament in exile _
implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist, accepting key U.N.
resolutions on the Middle East calling for negotiations with states
in the region.
   Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani said if Arafat does not receive a
visa, ``it will constitute a grievous blow to the process of peace
in the Middle East.''
   ``I feel very pained to see that the United States is the odd
couple with Israel in the United Nations,'' said Clovis Maksoud,
ambassador of the Arab League, which sponsored the resolution.
   ``We are hopeful the international outcry against the U.S.
position will jolt the subsequent U.S. administration into a
reassessment of its policies of bias toward Israel,'' he said.
   Arab diplomats said they would quickly introduce a resolution to
shift the General Assembly to Geneva in mid-December. The second
resolution would likely be voted on by early next week, and the
diplomats said they had the votes to pass it.
   The United States says it does not oppose a move to Geneva and
would participate in debate there.
   Undersecretary-General Joseph Verner Reed said plans were already
under way to move the assembly to Geneva, the European headquarters
of the world body. It would be the first time the assembly has moved
as an act of protest.
   The PLO has had a U.N. mission in New York since 1975 and holds
non-voting observer status. It is considered the sole, legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people and is invited to speak on
all debates concerning Palestinians and the Middle East.
   Under the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, the United
States is required to grant visas to U.N. diplomats and invitees on
U.N. business.
   In debate Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun reiterated
the State Department's assertion that the Headquarters Agreement
allows the United States to protect its security interests.
   The General Assembly debate on the Palestinian issue originally
was scheduled today, Friday and Dec. 6 but has been postponed.
   Diplomatic sources said the week of Dec. 12-16 would be the most
likely time for the session in Geneva.
   The resolution on moving must first be heard by a 16-member
budgetary advisory committee because it has financial implications.
   It then would go to the General Assembly's finance committee,
formally called the Fifth Committee, which would vote on it and send
it to the General Assembly for action.
   The cost of the move to Geneva was not known, but U.N. sources
have said it would be relatively modest, perhaps $150,000, covering
the travel of a small number of U.N. personnel. Most nations would
send their Geneva ambassadors to the session.

<TEXT>
   Buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
won the free-for-all takeover war for RJR Nabisco Inc. late
Wednesday with a record $24.53 billion offer for the
cigarette-and-food giant.
   The $109-a-share offer shattered a rival effort by an RJR
management group and came in a day of frantic maneuvering that at
times left the unprecedented auction for the company in utter
confusion.
   Kohlberg's offer of $81 in cash, $18 in stock and additional
securities worth $10 beat out a last-minute offer valued at $112, or
$25.2 billion, by the management group that instigated the takeover
struggle last month at a price that was $8.3 billion cheaper.
   The value of Kohlberg's offer was nearly double that of the
previous record, a $13.4 billion takeover of Gulf Corp. by Chevron
Corp. in March 1984.
   Although the management offer looked higher in face value, RJR
said in a statement that its board of directors concluded the
Kohlberg offer was worth substantially the same.
   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of all
directors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the best
interest of the company and its shareholders,'' RJR said.
   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in the business of buying
companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts,
issued a statement that it was pleased with the decision that capped
the biggest takeover in history.
   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so
that the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and the
communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return
to normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's two
principals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in the
statement.
   Kohlberg's victory caps a struggle that broke all previous
takeover records and raised major questions about the frenzy of
leveraged buyouts and other debt-financed restructurings
transforming much of corporate America.
   The end of the RJR battle also signaled a spectacular defeat by
its chief executive F. Ross Johnson, who began the takeover struggle
last month with a $75 a share offer that he later raised four times.
   Johnson, known as a scrappy adversary unafraid of taking risks,
had no immediate comment on Kohlberg's victory. It wasn't
immediately clear whether he would take another tack in what has
been an unpredictable battle.
   Earlier in the day, Johnson's group made an 11th-hour effort to
raise its bid from $101 a share to $108 a share after a
company-decreed deadline for all offers had expired. The move
temporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billion offer from
Kohlberg Kravis that was about to be approved, sources said.
   That development made the already unwieldy auction even more
chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were
receiving equal treatment. It also sent RJR's stock roaring higher,
partly in anticipation that the unprecedented auction might be
prolonged yet again.
   Sources familiar with the bidding also said the offer of a third
contender, First Boston Corp. was rejected as too tentative,
although the bidder valued it as high as $115 a share or $25.87
billion.
   A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash each
bidder intended to pay, because the value of the securities segment
is difficult to determine. These securities often are worth less
than their face amount.
   RJR stock surged on the New York Stock Exchange and the Big Board
briefly halted trading when buy orders overwhelmed sell orders on
Wednesday. The stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up
$2.25 to $93 on volume exceeding 6.7 million shares.
   RJR stock was trading at less than $56 a share when the battle
began in late October.
   Johnson's group incited the battle when he proposed to take the
nation's 19th-largest industrial company private via a leveraged
buyout.
   RJR's board of directors then put the company up for sale to
attract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction Nov.
18-20. They decided to prolong it because the offers received were
too vague and inadequate.
   RJR is one of the largest consumer products companies, with more
than 120,000 employees. It makes well-known brands that range from
Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal to Life Savers candy.

   The following is the official
English-language text of the U.N. Arab-sponsored resolution
deploring the U.S. denial of a visa for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
and urging the United States to reverse its decision.
   The General Assembly,
   Recalling Article 105 of the Charter of the United Nations and
the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of
America regarding the headquarters of the United Nations, dated 26
June 1947,
   Recalling also its resolution 3237 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974, in

designate the members of their delegation to participate in the
sessions and the work of the General Assembly,
   Having been apprised that the Palestine Liberation Organization,
in conformity with the usual practice, had requested through the
Secretary-General an entry visa for Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of
the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in
order to participate in the forty-third session of the General
Assembly,

<HEAD>Pentagon Severs Military Computer Network From Academic Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, citing technical difficulties, has
cut links for several days between an unclassified military computer
network and a nationwide academic and corporate computer network,
The New York Times reported Thursday.
   Several computer security experts said Wednesday that they had
been told by Pentagon officials that the network connection was
severed after an unknown intruder illegally gained entry recently to
several computers operated by the military and defense contractors,
according to the Times.
   The computer specialists said they thought the Pentagon broke the
connection, which permits military and academic researchers to
exchange information, while it tried to eliminate a security flaw in
the computers in the military network, the newspaper reported.
   An unidentified spokesman for the Defense Communication Agency
told the Times in a statement that the links between the two
networks were cut at 10 p.m. Monday and were expected to be restored
Thursday.
   The Department of Defense apparently acted after a computer at
the Mitre Corp., a Bedford, Mass., company with several military
contracts, was illegally entered several times during the past
month, according to the Times.
   Officials at several universities in the United States and Canada
said their computers had been used by the intruder to reach the
Mitre computer.
   Marcia Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mitre, told the Times Wednesday
that one of the company's computers had been entered. But she said
no classified or sensitive information had been handled by the
computers involved and the problem was fixed within hours of being
detected.
   The military computer network, known as Milnet, is linked through
seven gateways to another larger computer network, Arpanet, which
was jammed last month by a rogue program introduced by a Cornell
University graduate student.
   The decision to disconnect the military computers upset a number
of computer users around the country.
   John Rochlis, assistant network manager at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said that a computer user complained
Tuesday night that ``he could not send mail.''
   ``Initially we were given the run around, but eventually they
unofficially confirmed to us that the shutoff was security
related,'' he added.

<HEAD>Authorities Investigating Alleged Scheme To Ship Nerve Gas To Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities are investigating an alleged
scheme to illegally ship a chemical used to make nerve gas to Iran
from the United States, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
   Documents filed in U.S. District Court in St. Louis say a company
in Baltimore attempted to ship thiodiglycol, a chemical precursor of
mustard gas, to Iran via Singapore and Pakistan, the Post-Dispatch
said in its Thursday editions.
   The documents were filed in an application for a search warrant
which sought telexes, computer printouts and records of messages
between Alcolac International Inc. of Baltimore, maker of the
chemical, and two companies in West Germany and Singapore.
   In the 8-year war between Iran and Iraq, both sides _ but
particularly Iraq _ were accused of using chemical weapons. Both
sides denied using the weapons, which are outlawed under the Geneva
Convention.
   Thiodiglycol has permissible applications in the textile
industry, but its export is restricted under U.S. export laws ``to
prevent diversion to Iran, Iraq and Syria for use in chemical
warfare,'' the affidavit says.
   The U.S. Customs Service outlined the scheme in a 14-page
affidavit file in their application for the search warrant.
   The affidavit says Alcolac began shipping thiodiglycol in
February 1987 for Colimex GmbH, a West German company now called
Chemco GmbH & Co. KG.
   Alcolac's shipping documents referred to the cargo by its trade
name, Kromfax, rather by its chemical name. The documents had been
manipulated to make it possible to divert the cargo to Karachi,
Pakistan, in violation of U.S. Export Administration Regulations,
the affidavit says.
   The cargo began its journey by barge from Baltimore to Norfolk,
where customs agents intercepted it and switched the Kromfax drums
with drums of water.
   Customs agents then monitored the cargo's route to Singapore and
its transshipment to Karachi.
   In late June, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration
learned from customs officials in Karachi that the shipment had been
transferred to an Iranian flagship named ``SS Iran Ekram.''
   The cargo then made its way to the Iranian port at Bandar Abbas.
It was set to be delivered ultimately to a company in Tehran, the
capital of Iran.
   The affidavit says an undated telex from Walaschek to Alcolac
indicates ``that he intended to cause the shipment of thiodiglycol
to be transshipped from Singapore to Pakistan, and ultimately Iran,
and that Alcolac knew that Singapore was not the ultimate
destination for the shipment.''
   Alcolac International was incorporated in Baltimore in 1955. Paul
Jones, vice president and general manager of the performance
chemicals division, said the company manufactured ``specialty
chemicals'' like those in shampoos. Thiodiglycol is a solvent, he
said.

<HEAD>Chicken, Fresh Veggies Will be Best Food Buys in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicken, rather than beef and pork, and fresh
vegetables rather than canned or frozen ones are likely to be the
best bargains for consumers in 1989, according to a top Agriculture
Department food economist.
   Prices for eggs are likely to shoot upward as much as 20 percent,
and substantial price increases for fresh fruits, cereals and bakery
products also can be expected, department economist Ralph Parlett
says in a 1989 outlook report issued Wednesday.
   Overall, consumer food prices should rise about 3 to 5 percent
next year, Parlett said, roughly equaling this year's 4 percent
increase. This year's rise means food prices have about kept pace
with price increases in the rest of the economy, although consumers
may notice their food bills more because of more frequent trips to
the grocery store, he said.
   A variety of factors influence food costs, including the amount
farmers make for the raw commodities, the costs of packaging
materials, and charges for processing and distribution. In 1988,
packaging cost increases were the main contributor to a 5 percent
increase in processing and distribution expense, while farmers
averaged 3.5 percent more for their raw products.
   For 1989, Parlett said increases in egg prices will be the
sharpest in the marketbasket, 15 to 20 percent, in part because of a
squeeze produced by increased use of eggs in processing and a
decline in production because of higher feed costs and poor returns
to producers.
   Other steep increases are likely in fresh fruits, which may go up
6 to 9 percent because of strong consumer demand both domestically
and in the export market. Orange prices are likely to remain strong
because of growing purchases by Japan, and a smaller apple crop will
lead to higher prices there.
   Continued effects of the 1988 drought will be felt in the area of
cereals and bakery products, Parlett said. Prices are expected to
rise 4 to 7 percent next year due to a combination of grain price
increases and strengthened demand from health-conscious consumers
who see cereals as a good and easy-to-prepare nutrition source.
   The biggest bargain for shoppers, compared to current prices,
will be in poultry, Parlett said. Growing supplies will bring prices
down by at least 4 percent and possibly as much as 7 percent, he
said. Beef production next year is likely to drop by 6 to 8 percent,
leading to a moderate 1 to 3 percent price increase, similar to that
expected for pork.
   Prices for fresh vegetables, which climbed this year because of
the drought, will show little change next year because of expanding
production, the economist forecast. Parlett said he expects an
increase in the range of 0 to 3 percent, compared to a 4 to 7
percent increase for processed vegetables.

   Prices farmers received for raw products in
November declined slightly from a month earlier but remained nearly
8 percent above their level of a year ago, the Agriculture
Department says.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report Wednesday that lower prices for hogs, corn,
grapefruit and soybeans were partly offset by higher prices for
tomatoes, potatoes, milk and sweet corn, resulting in an overall
drop of nearly 1 percent for the month.
   In part driven by the summer's drought, prices received by
farmers had been rising throughout most of 1988 until September,
when the increase leveled off. November's decline was the first drop
in the price index since February.
   Despite the decline of the overall price index, some commodities
continued higher in November. Wheat, for example, rose an additional
6 cents per bushel to a U.S. farm price average of $3.90 per bushel,
the most since it was $3.95 in May 1981.
   Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were off
just less than 1 percent from October. Hog prices, at $36 per
hundredweight, were the lowest since June 1980, while beef cattle
prices were unchanged at $67.10. Dairy products and eggs were
higher, while broiler prices declined. Compared with November 1987,
the index was up 5.6 percent.
   The department's all-crops price index for November, although
unchanged from October, was up 11 percent from a year earlier.
Prices of feed grain and hay as a group declined 3.7 percent from
last month and averaged 49 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Prices of commercial vegetables were up 22 percent from October
but off 30 percent from November 1987. Tomatoes led the price
increases, while carrot prices decreased slightly.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55
billion to $60 billion this year, compared with the record level of
$57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Preliminary figures show that food prices for 1988 will average a
4 percent increase, about the same as last year's increase. For
1989, department economists are projecting food cost hikes in the
same range, about 3 to 5 percent.

<HEAD>Quayle May Preside More In Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle may spend more
time than his predecessors presiding over the Senate, a move that
could spell conflict between the Democratic-controlled chamber and
the administration.
   In an interview, Quayle on Wednesday also made his strongest
public rejection of the notion that he will act as the link between
the administration and the Republican Party's far right.
   He also said his verbal gaffes during the campaign gave him some
hard lessons about his own tendency to talk too much. Being besieged
with questions and jokes about his qualifications was painful but
educational, he said.
   ``I know myself better now. I'm a stronger person,'' he said.
   Quayle said his focus now is on the task ahead _ picking his vice
presidential staff during the transition period and working with
President-elect George Bush.
   Since the election, conservatives have beaten a path to Quayle's
transition office seeking his ear. Quayle himself is an ardent
conservative who has largely supported Reagan administration
positions during his eight years in the Senate.
   ``I've worked with a number of conservatives in the past; a lot
of good friends are conservatives, but I'm not the point man for the
conservatives in this administration. ... You won't see me being the
so-called spear carrier for all the so-called conservative issues,''
Quayle said.
   Quayle also hinted that he may take a more active role in his
official capacity as president of the Senate, presiding over the
Democratic-controlled chamber more frequently.
   ``It's certainly an option. ... There have been suggestions to me
by many that I consider spending more time in the Senate than my
predecessors have. I have not made a decision on that,'' he said.
   The presiding officer has substantial discretion as to which
senator to recognize for the purpose of offering amendments, bills
and motions. Normally the chair is occupied by a member of the
majority party. A Republican in charge could touch off partisan
parliamentary warfare.
   The vice president may take the presiding chair at any time, and
the presiding officer's decision to recognize a senator is not
subject to a point of order or appeal under Senate rules.
   Bush has said he wants to work with Congress, and Quayle said if
he did decide to preside more often, it would not be done ``in a
contentious manner.''
   ``I would be fair and objective and do what the president of the
Senate should do to protect senators' rights, all senators'
rights,'' he said.
   During the interview, Quayle was relaxed and friendly, but
clearly weighing his words. He has not generally spoken to the press
in depth since the election. He confessed to being ``far more
careful of what I say today than six months ago.''
   ``I also try to discipline myself when I get into a situation ...
instead of being verbose, which is a tendency that I have, to be
concise. Because verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things.''
   Also on Wednesday, Quayle met with retiring Indiana Gov. Robert
D. Orr, a Republican who will appoint Quayle's replacement in the
Senate. Quayle will resign effective Jan. 2 so his replacement can
have seniority over other incoming senators.
   Orr has not said whom he will appoint, and Quayle said he made no
recommendation. But he did not reject a reporter's suggestion that
he favors Rep. Dan Coats, who was Quayle's district representative
in Fort Wayne, Ind., while Quayle was in the House from 1976 to
1980. Coats now represents Quayle's old congressional district.
   ``Obviously I think a lot of Dan Coats. He worked for me for four
years. He's been a very good congressman from my old congressional
district. He took my seat. We've had a long and strong personal and
professional relationship,'' Quayle said.
   On another subject, Quayle said the vice presidential mansion in
the District of Columbia may need alterations before his family can

   The war on drugs is overwhelming a criminal
justice system whose greatest problem is lack of resources, not
legal protections afforded criminal suspects, a two-year American
Bar Association study concludes.
   ``The entire system is starved: police, prosecution, criminal
defense, courts and corrections,'' says the report by an ABA
committee. ``As currently funded, the criminal justice system cannot
provide the quality of justice that the public legitimately expects
and that the people working within the system wish to deliver.''
   Less than 3 percent of all government spending in the United
States went to support civil and criminal justice activities in
fiscal 1985, a previously released federal study has shown.
   Those already thin resources are being overwhelmed by a massive _
but largely unsuccessful _ battle against illegal drugs, the ABA
panel concluded.
   It said that while courts are increasingly clogged, the drug
problem ``is growing worse, and ... law enforcement has been unable
to control'' it.
   The ABA study noted political disputes about the Miranda decision
but found relatively few problems in the field related to it. That
decision, issued in 1966 by the Supreme Court, said police must warn
suspects of their right to remain silent and to consult with a
lawyer before any questioning takes place.
   While the Miranda decision ``has sparked heated controversy on a
political level, the restrictions itsaid.
   Eighty-seven percent of prosecutors surveyed for the study said
no more than 5 percent of their cases were dismissed because of
problems involving the Miranda requirements.
   The exclusionary rule _ under which evidence obtained illegally
by police may not be used in court _ also has caused few major
problems, the study concluded. Some police officials, in fact, told
the panel that the demands of the exclusionary rule have promoted
professionalism in the nation's police departments.
   Most prosecutors put the number of cases dismissed because of the
exclusionary rule at 5 percent or less, while three-quarters of the
judges and defense lawyers polled said suppression motions succeed
just 10 percent or less of the time.
   The study was based on testimony from the legal community and a
national telephone survey of police, prosecutors, defense attorneys
and judges. It was compiled by a panel chaired by Samuel Dash,
former chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee and a
Georgetown University law professor.
   The study said efforts to bring the nation's drug problem under
control are swamping the criminal justice system.
   ``Police, prosecutors and judges told the committee that they
have been unsuccessful in making a significant impact on the
importation, sale and use of illegal drugs, despite devoting much of
their resources to the arrest, prosecution and trial of drug
offenders,'' the panel reported.
   ``These extraordinary efforts have instead distorted and
overwhelmed the criminal justice system, crowding dockets and jails,
and diluting law enforcement and judicial efforts to deal with other
major criminal cases.''
   The panel recommended that the ABA set up a special commission to
study and re-evaluate national, state and local strategies in
dealing with the drug problem and to educate the public and
lawmakers as well as government policymakers.

   Texans in Congress will have a tough time
persuading their colleagues to spend the billions of dollars needed
to build the super collider, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen says.
   ``I'll be working very hard to get it funded,'' Bentsen said.
``It's going to be exceedingly difficult to get.''
   Even when seven states were candidates for the potentially
lucrative physics project, Congress was adamant about financing the
super collider. It voted earlier this year to give the project $100
million _ less than one-third of President Reagan's request for $363
million _ and decreed none of the money could be spent on
construction.
   ``It's going to be uphill and tough, and particularly now because
it's just one state,'' Bentsen, chairman of the influential Senate
Finance Committee, told a group of Texas reporters in Washington on
Wednesday. ``We had seven states working on it before.''
   Now that a site in Ellis County has been chosen by the Energy
Department for the super collider, at least one member of Congress
from a state that lost its bid to host the project is questioning
the feasibility of finding enough construction money. The super
collider is expected to cost $4.4 billion, and to create thousands
of construction and scientific jobs.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said last week that the
superconducting super collider was in trouble and would likely be
doomed by budget constraints and opposition from others in the
scientific community.
   ``And quite honestly, the way the program has been set up, the
consequences are that there's really very limited support outside of
one particular state,'' said Dingell, chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee. ``I haven't said it's going to go down the
drain, but it's in serious difficulty.''
   He said it stood a chance of one or two in 10 of ever being built.

   A 20-year-old Alabama resident wrote a top
federal health official that the public reaction to disclosing he
tested positive for the AIDS virus would end his life ``sooner than
AIDS will probably take it.''
   The letter from ``D'' _ his identity is known to Public Health
Service officials _ was among eight from people with AIDS being read
today during a World AIDS Day ceremony at the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   ``I live in the Bible Belt of our country,'' began the letter to
Dr. Robert E. Windom, the No. 2 physician in the federal health
department. ``I have lived most of my life in a small town in
Alabama. I attend a large university in Alabama and will soon be
finishing my junior year.
   ``I can't tell you my name because my short life of only 20 years
would be over very quickly. It would be over sooner than AIDS will
probably take it. I'm HIV positive and have been so diagnosed since
spring of 1987.
   ``I sit in classrooms and hear people discuss AIDS and what they
think they know is right. Why can't I speak up and tell them they
can't get it from just being in the same room? Why can't I tell them
the truth?
   ``I'm so afraid of what will happen if I openly admit to being
HIV positive. Would I get kicked out of school? I was so afraid of
what people would think, I didn't even talk to my parents about it
for six months. I was hurting so bad. I was lonely.
   ``Now, my father has never even said the word AIDS and my mother
only makes sure I'm in good health and eating right and taking
vitamins.''
   Windom, the assistant secretary for health, arranged the program,
including an opening minute of silence for the people who have died
of AIDS.
   As of Nov. 7, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 77,994 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 43,888, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>NRC Chief Cites Improved Safety And Efficiency At Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's nuclear power plants have become
safer and more efficient over the last four years, according to the
head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The remarks by Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. came at ceremonies
Wednesday to dedicate an 18-story headquarters building for the NRC
in suburban Rockville, Md.
   ``I am pleased to report that we are seeing evidence that overall
performance is improving,'' Zech told the gathering.
   Spokesmen for anti-nuclear groups challenged Zech's upbeat
assessment, with one contending that the situation with power
reactors amounted to a ``mixed bag'' of improvements and problem
areas.
   ``From 1984 until now, there has been a clear and definite
improvement,'' Zech said, noting that the NRC began an analysis in
that year of safety indicators. Zech said there had been reductions
in ``significant operating events'' at power reactors, unplanned
automatic shutdowns, safety system activations, ``precursor events''
signaling the possibility of a major accident as well as exposure of
workers to radiation.
   ``Along with this improvement in critical safety performance
indicators, we have seen improvements in plant reliability and
availability,'' Zech said. ``Recent data shows an increase in the
average capacity factors for U.S. reactors from about 59 percent in
1986 to almost 67 percent in 1988.''
   The capacity factor is the actual output of a plant compared with
what it would generate if it operated at full power all the time.
   NRC spokesman John Kopeck later provided the following specific
figures for the performance indicators cited by Zech:
   _``Significant operating events,'' or major problems: 2.4 per
operating reactor in 1985; 1.6 in 1986; and 0.8 in 1987.
   _Unplanned automatic shutdowns: 5.24 per reactor in 1984; 5.04 in
1985; 3.96 in 1986; and 3.24 in 1987.
   _Safety system activations: 2.76 per reactor in 1984; 2.6 in
1985; 2.04 in 1986; and 1.68 in 1987.
   _Precursor events: a nationwide total of 17 in 1984; 10 in 1985;
and 6 in 1986.
   _Radiation exposure: 714 man-rem in 1984; 574 man-rem in 1985;
431 in 1986; and 425 in 1987.
   Man-rem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of
people. For example, when 100 people receive an average exposure of
0.01 rem, that would result in a figure of 1 man-rem.
   Spokesmen for anti-nuclear groups said they had questions about
Zech's assessment of overall plant performance.
   Kenneth Bossong of Public Citizen, a Washington-based public
interest group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said:
``It's a mixed bag. There are some positives and there are some
negatives. It's not fair or accurate for Zech to say everything is
looking better because it's not.''
   For example, Bossong said: ``On the radiation issue, what he said
is true as far as it went, but it's not complete. The average dose
per worker at nuclear power plants has decreased since 1984, but the
number of workers exposed, on the other hand, has increased.''
   He said the number of workers exposed has increased from 93,000
in 1985 to slightly more than 100,000 in 1986 and 104,000 workers in
1987.
   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, another Washington-based public interest group,
said: ``There may be a slightly improving track record. However,
there's no reason to be smug about it. ... It seems like every time
they think something has been solved, they find a new problem.''
   The new 286,000-square-foot NRC headquarters building, purchased
by the government for $47.5 million, provides space for about 1,400
NRC employees. It marks an effort to consolidate operations of the
agency, which previously were dispersed among 10 separate buildings.
   A second structure is to be built at the same Rockville site by
1991 to accommodate the rest of the agency's Washington area
employees.

   Solidarity backers declared Lech Walesa the
winner of an unprecedented TV debate in which he dueled with his
official counterpart and urged the government to legalize the banned
labor movement.
   ``This is a fantastic day, beautiful, which will be noted in the
history of our country as a great victory for Solidarity,'' said
film director Andrzej Wajda after Wednesday night's showdown between
the Solidarity chairman and Alfred Miodowicz, head of the
government's official trade unions.
   ``He was perfect, just perfect,'' a grinning Adam Michnik, a
senior Solidarity adviser, said of Walesa.
   It was the first time in five years that Walesa had a chance to
defend his federation on state-controlled television and his longest
appearance ever on Polish TV.
   The exchange was broadcast live and uncensored. A clock was even
placed in the background of the set to demonstrate that no deletions
were made.
   In the 43-minute debate, an animated Walesa spoke rapidly,
challenging authorities to legalize Solidarity. He urged the
official unions to join Solidarity in ``creating freedom.''
   He also said Miodowicz, as a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo and as leader of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions,
should press for the legalization of the outlawed labor movement.
   ``If you can make a man's decision that there is a place for
Solidarity, we will immediately roll up our sleeves and we will
begin working hard for Poland, because time is running out,'' Walesa
told the 59-year-old former steelworker.
   Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent union federation,
was crushed under martial law in 1981 and banned in 1982.
Miodowicz's group, known by its Polish initials OPZZ, was created by
the government in 1982 to replace it.
   The official unions say they have 7 million members, including
4.5 million former Solidarity members.
   Solidarity was founded during a turbulent series of strikes in
1980. In its heyday, it said it had 10 million members.
   In the debate, Walesa said proposed talks between the opposition
and government could begin when officials acknowledge Solidarity's
right to exist.
   After the broadcast, Walesa told reporters he suffered from a
severe case of flu that hampered his performance and made him ``too
impulsive.''
   Miodowicz, interviewed as he left the debate set, said only: ``I
have fulfilled my task. I am pleased that Mr. Walesa accepted my
invitation.''
   The state-run PAP news agency said that although the two debaters
disagreed, ``the very fact of the meeting is a good prognosis for
overcoming barriers in reaching ... dialogue and national
agreement.''
   The debate brought thousands of rapt Poles to television sets. In
Warsaw's Central Station, Grzegorz Streszynski missed his train to
western Poland to watch. ``Walesa made great remarks. I waited seven
years to hear them,'' he said afterward.
   Walesa said during the debate that all socialist countries were
in difficult straits and blamed their problems on a lack of
``pluralism,'' independent groups and ideas in public life.
   In a reference to changes under way in the Soviet Union, he said
conditions had never been better for reform but that Poland
nevertheless was merely ``toddling in place.''
   Miodowicz said said each enterprise should have only one trade
union to avoid dividing the workforce. He said some Solidarity
backers have shouted anti-state slogans like ``Down with the
Commune,'' which he called ``terrifying.''
   ``Our society must have peace, at least social peace, at least
security for society,'' he said.
   He urged Solidarity supporters to enlist in his trade unions.
   But Walesa, a 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said: ``You want me
to come on my knees to your union. I don't want to. I want to be
myself.''
   Dressed in a gray suit and wearing a Solidarity badge and an
image of the madonna on his lapel, Walesa, 45, looked relaxed as sat
next to his debate opponent, both in leather lounge chairs.
   As the debate progressed, Walesa took the offensive, gesturing
broadly with his hands. The Solidarity leader did most of the
talking overall.
   Miodowicz proposed the debate Nov. 14 during an interview with
the official Communist Party daily newspaper Trybuna Ludu.
   The last time Walesa defended Solidarity on Polish television was
in 1983, when he responded to a speech given by then-Deputy Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who now serves as prime minister.

<TEXT>
   Even before George Bush was elected president,
his personnel chief was closeted with President Reagan's, going over
hundreds of sheets of paper that will help shape the staffing of the
new administration.
   It was part of a project initiated by the Office of Presidential
Personnel designed in part to provide the incoming president with an
unprecedented amount of information about the nature and
requirements of the jobs he must fill.
   Bradley H. Patterson, a White House staffer in three past
Republican administrations, discussed the project in his new book,
``Ring of Power,'' saying, ``Such interpresidential foresightedness
shows the modern White House at its best.''
   ``A catalogue of all the full-time and part-time presidentially
appointed jobs in the Executive Branch - their titles, terms, pay
levels, and in brief their current duties - is being saved for the
recruiters who, serving the next president, will occupy the
Presidential Personnel Office chairs,'' Patterson said.
   ``The catalogues may even be available to the candidates
following the conventions,'' he wrote.
   It didn't turn out quite that way, though. Although Bush's people
were poring over the documents before Nov. 8, aides to Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis never even got a peek.
   ``We never heard from the Dukakis people,'' Robert H. Tuttle,
director of presidential personnel, said in an interview. ``They
never called.'' He conceded he didn't call them, either, but said:
``They knew where I was. They knew my number.''
   He said the information was shared with the Bush staff ``in
anticipation of Bush's victory.''
   Tuttle said he met with Chase Untermeyer, Bush's transition
personnel director, ``just about the time of the election - I think
we did some before and some after.''
   Untermeyer, briefing reporters Wednesday, said, ``The people whom
we are hiring right now to go to work on ... recommending the jobs
to be filled on behalf of the president-elect have as much material
preparation as has ever been the case before.''
   ``One of the resources available to me that, frankly, wasn't
available to my counterpart on the Dukakis campaign, was being able
to spend 12 different sessions in the White House with Bob Tuttle
and his people, going over just what is the current presidential
personnel system,'' Untermeyer said.
   Too often in the past, said Untermeyer, the system used was one
known by the acronym BOGSAT, which he said stands for ``bunch of
guys sitting around a table.''
   Tuttle said there are 551 Executive Branch positions, not
counting 135 ambassadors, filled by presidential appointment subject
to Senate confirmation.
   ``We went through each one in detail with my associate director
and so we probably spent 20 or 30 hours with Chase Untermeyer going
through these,'' he said.
   Tuttle also said that at the request of both Reagan and Bush his
office called all presidential appointees and asked them: ``Do you
want to continue in your present job? And are there other jobs you
are interested in?''
   He said he met with Untermeyer last week and went over the
responses, in which ``a great percentage'' said they either wanted
to keep their present job or take a new job in the administration.
   Untermeyer said he is following up on this by speaking to the
incumbent Cabinet secretaries and asking them for ``their very
candid appraisal of each of those individuals: Who are the ones
whose resignations we should accept and let return to the private
sector? Who are those who are doing such a good job or have such
unique skills that they should stay in their present job?''
   The latter, he added, ``will be, as Mr. Bush has said, the
exception rather than the rule.''

<TEXT>
   John Tower, the former senator and leading
candidate to be Secretary of Defense in the next administration, is
registered as a lobbyist for five large defense companies, according
to a Tower associate and congressional records.
   Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is
the chief candidate to take over the top Pentagon spot, but
President-elect George Bush hasn't yet made a final decision,
according to sources speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
   Some Bush aides oppose Tower because they fear he wouldn't push
hard enough to reform the Pentagon's problem-plagued system for
buying weapons, the sources said.
   Bush sidestepped the question Wednesday. Asked by reporters about
reports of staff dissension over Tower, Bush said only, ``stay
tuned,'' repeating his favorite refrain on administration
nominations. He said ``all is tranquil'' within his staff.
   Representatives of Bush and Tower are negotiating over who might
be named to high-level Defense Department jobs, the sources said.
   Tower, 63, retired from Congress in 1985 after a 24-year career
in the Senate, capped by his chairmanship of the Senate Armed
Services Committee during President Reagan's first term.
   After he retired, Tower was named by Reagan as a member of the
U.S. team negotiating with the Soviets for deep cuts in the
U.S.-Soviet arsenals of long-range weapons. He quit after 14 months
in that post and set up a consulting firm, Tower & Associates.
   Early this year, the White House asked Tower to help lobby his
former Senate colleagues to ratify the treaty ridding Europe and the
Soviet Union of medium-range nuclear weapons, said Richard Billmire,
a Tower associate.
   Tower did not return telephone calls. But Billmire said the
company registered Feb. 2 as a lobbyist because Tower didn't want
any conflict-of-interest questions raised about his work on the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, as the agreement is known.
   Tower & Associates is registered as a lobbyist for
Martin-Marietta, Textron, LTV Aerospace and Defense Co., British
Aerospace and Rockwell International.
   Tower is a consultant to the five firms, Billmire said, and as
such would not be required to register as a lobbyist unless he
lobbied Congress on their behalf.
   ``We registered because the White House asked for our help on the
INF treaty and we were working as consultants for these companies at
the same time,'' said Billmire.
   ``The companies make some components which go into systems that
are used for weapons affected by the treaty,'' he explained. ``Tower
wanted to be absolutely clear and up front about his connections
with the companies and he didn't want anybody saying that the reason
Tower was saying this or that about the treaty was because it would
have helped one of his clients.''
   Billmire declined to say what the firm was paid by the five
companies. But Tower might be expected to have received more than
$50,000 annually from each, according to a defense contractor who
spoke Wednesday on condition he not be named.
   Tower is also a member of the board of directors of the U.S.
subsidiary of British Aerospace. That subsidiary is based in
Delaware.

   Political eccentric Lyndon LaRouche's
``security'' fund was used to pay for items including a piano,
haircuts, flowers, shoes and cufflinks, according to testimony in
his tax fraud trial.
   LaRouche financial officer Kathy Magraw acknowledged on Wednesday
that the movement's security account paid for items which _
according to prosecutors _ should have been declared as taxable
income.
   LaRouche's trial continues today in U.S. District Court, where he
is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
A grand jury accused LaRouche of failing to declare as income the
personal and household expenses financed by his organizations, and
of refusing to file federal tax returns since 1979.
   By calling Ms. Magraw to the stand, prosecutors continued using a
strategy of compelling LaRouche aides to testify about the
movement's finances under grants of limited immunity from
prosecution.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson said Ms. Magraw's testimony
would not only support the tax count, but charges that LaRouche and
six co-defendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not
repaying their loans to his organizations.
   The personal expenditures cited by Ms. Magraw were made while the
LaRouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was
available to repay some $25 million of the more than $30 million
lent to the movement. About $5 million was repaid, according to
earlier testimony.
   Trying to rebut the personal expense testimony, defense lawyers
attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for LaRouche
was for legitimate security and research purposes _ not for his
personal benefit.
   The defense effort was cut short, however, by U.S. District Judge
Albert V Bryan Jr. He refused to allow any defense questioning of
Ms. Magraw on the movement's need for consultants, who were paid
weekly, monthly, daily, and flat payments. Defense lawyers described
the consultants as national security experts.
   The defense struck out, too, when it tried to question the
witness about payments for security protection for two Latin
American members of LaRouche's organization. The defense contended
they were threatened by drug dealers, and were given refuge with
their families in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate.
   The government, on the other hand, was permitted to introduce a
memo prepared by Ms. Magraw, in which she said listing consultant
payments under ``legal investigations, services rendered for
personal research'' was ``not a particularly defensible position
under IRS scrutiny.''
   Ms. Magraw testified that she really didn't know if the expenses
were listed improperly under IRS regulations.
   Robinson, the prosecutor, had Ms. Magraw read for jurors some of
the expenses from LaRouche's ``security'' fund, which was designed
for the personal security of LaRouche, his aides and his guests.
   Among the items was a $7,000 piano and furniture for LaRouche's
Leesburg estate; cufflinks, for LaRouche; shoes for LaRouche's wife,
Helga; film; clothes for LaRouche; flowers; luggage costing $415.96;
a hairdresser appointment for Mrs. LaRouche and a $10 haircut for
LaRouche; a $25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person,
and reimbursement for a wine purchase.
   Ms. Magraw said the furniture and piano were for a building where
the LaRouche organization scheduled political and cultural events.
   LaRouche's political movement embraces a number of unorthodox
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving such
figures as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the queen
of England.
   Another LaRouche finance officer, Richard Welsh, testified
Wednesday that he thought Kissinger might be responsible for the
movement's financial problems.
   Welsh said he based his theory, in part, on a letter from
Kissinger to the FBI in 1982, which the LaRouche organization
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Kissinger wrote, ``Because these people have been getting
increasingly obnoxious, I have taken the liberty of asking my
lawyer, Bill Rogers, to get in touch with you to ask your advice,
especially with respect to security.''
   Welsh testified that he sent a memo to LaRouche about Kissinger
in October 1984, in the midst of LaRouche's second of three
presidential campaigns.
   ``You stated in the memo that Kissinger was behind the actions''
to hurt the LaRouche organization financially, asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Kent Robinson.
   ``It was the primary but not the only suggestion I made,'' Welsh
testified.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.
   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.
   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser, William Wertz;
his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   A probe into last summer's disappearance of a
young Marine during training maneuvers in California is being
reopened and three officers involved in the mystery face
court-martial, the Marine Corps says.
   The commandant of the corps, Gen. Alfred M. Gray, on Wednesday
ordered a reopening of the investigation into the disappearance of
Lance Corporal Jason J. Rother of Minneapolis.
   The Marines also announced that Rother's squad leader, platoon
sergeant and a third officer would face court-martial on various
charges in trials expected to begin in about two weeks.
   Rother, 19, was helping direct vehicles at Twentynine Palms,
Calif., a Marine base, during combat maneuvers the night of last
Aug. 30. The infantryman, who had been stationed at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., was reported missing two days later and has not been seen
since.
   Hundreds of Marines using dogs searched the base and the
surrounding area for several days and found nothing but a pack and
some rocks positioned into the shape of an arrow.
   A second search, conducted several weeks later, also found
nothing.
   The new investigation into Rother's disappearance is expected to
last one month, said Marine spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Kerstens.
   The Marines said that Rother's squad leader, Sgt. Thomas B.
Turnell, will be tried on charges of dereliction of duty and
unauthorized absence. Sgt. Christopher P. Clyde, Rother's platoon
sergeant, was also charged with dereliction of duty.
   And 1st Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who oversaw the placing the road
guides that night, has been charged with dereliction of duty and
willful disobedience of an order for allegedly not posting guides in
pairs, as he had been told to do.
   In addition, a platoon leader and company commander have been
relieved of their commands and reprimanded. Kerstens said the names
of the two officers were not being released.
   Kerstens said she could provide no further details on the alleged
actions by the accused officers that resulted in the charges.
   The three courts-martial will be conducted at Camp Lejeune.

<TEXT>
   A man who said he was dominated by
two of his 10 personalities was sentenced to death Wednesday for
shooting his teen-age daughter and throwing her nude body down an
embankment near the Great Dismal Swamp.
   Thomas Lee Bonney, 45, of Chesapeake, Va., was sentenced to die
Feb. 3, but the sentence is automatically appealed to the North
Carolina Supreme Court. He was transported to Central Prison in
Raleigh after sentencing.
   Superior Court Judge Paul M. Wright also denied defense motions
for a mistrial and a reversal of the jury's decision.
   On Friday, a jury convicted Bonney of first-degree murder in the
slaying of Kathy Carole Bonney, 19, a year ago in November. Jurors
deliberated almost seven hours Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday
morning before recommending the death sentence.
   Jurors said defense testimony of videotapes showing Bonney under
hypnosis by clinical psychologist Paul F. Dell of Norfolk, Va., were
not convincing.
   The defense used the tapes to show Bonney's alleged multiple
personalities. But jurors said they believed Dell used leading
questions.
   Bonney joins more than 80 inmates on North Carolina's death row.
The last person to be executed in North Carolina was John Rook of
Raleigh on Sept. 18, 1986.

   Miss America 1987 Kaye Lani Rae Rafko says
she is engaged to a 26-year-old computer analyst she met five years
ago in a strawberry patch.
   The 25-year-old nurse, whose reign ended in September, said
Monday she plans to marry Chuck Wilson next August and settle
somewhere between Ann Arbor and Monroe, Rafko's hometown 25 miles
south of Detroit.
   ``He's my best friend in the whole world,'' said Rafko. ``He
treats me like a lady.''
   The Monroe man met his bride-to-be in 1983 while she was picking
strawberries at a farm where he worked. For Wilson, it was love at
first sight, although he waited until Nov. 21 of this year to pop
the question.
   Rafko said she was equally smitten but needed a little prodding
from her mother.
   ``She said, `Why don't you go over and talk to him?''' Rafko
recalled. ``I ended up going back three times that day to pick
strawberries and I gave him my phone number. He was just real
special.''

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and estranged
actress wife, Robin Givens, slugging it out in divorce courts, were
sued by a furrier who claims they owe him more than $92,000 for a
sable coat for Givens' mother.
   Jack-Paul Waltzer Inc. on Wednesday sued Tyson, Givens and Tyson
Enterprises for the cost of a natural Russian golden sable coat they
allegedly bought for Ruth Roper, Givens' mother.
   According to court papers, Paul Waltzer took a sampling of coats
to Tyson's Bernardsville, N.J., estate on Sept. 30 so the boxer and
Givens could pick one as ``a surprise birthday gift'' for Roper.
   The $85,000 sable coat came to $92,012.50 with tax, but when
Waltzer said he wasn't equipped to take a credit card, the couple
offered to pay by check the next day.
   However, on the day Waltzer said he showed up, the couple made an
appearence on ABC's ``20-20'' in which Givens called Tyson a
manic-depressive with ``an extremely volatile temper.'' The boxer
later reportedly flew into a rage, and the couple sued each other
for divorce in October.
   Waltzer said he still is waiting for the check and wants payment,
with interest, plus court costs and legal fees.
   Efforts to reach Tyson for comment were unsuccessful. Calls to
his home went unanswered.

   Santa will get a little help from rock 'n'
roller Jerry Lee Lewis when this town about 20 miles south of
Memphis, Tenn., stages its Christmas parade Saturday.
   Lewis, who has owned a rural residence near this town of about
3,000 residents since 1972, will serve as the parade's grand
marshal, Donna Greer, director of the chamber of commerce, said
recently.
   The 53-year-old performer, his sixth wife, Kerrie, 25, and their
11-month-old son, Jerry Lee III, are scheduled to lead the parade in
a red Corvette convertible.
   A security guard will follow in another vehicle. Santa will come
later on a float.
   Mrs. Lewis said she wanted to participate in the parade to let
people in the area know she and her husband want to be good
neighbors.
   ``Now, hopefully they won't think we're snobs anymore,'' Mrs.
Lewis said. ``Actually we're probably more boring than anybody
else.''

   Mayor Sophie Masloff hasn't formally announced
she is running for election next year, but she told actor Ed Asner
anyway.
   Asner, in Pittsburgh to perform in the Broadway-bound comedy
``Born Yesterday,'' visited the mayor Tuesday in her office.
   ``I'm running for re-election next year. The (primary) election's
in May,'' Masloff told the actor.
   Then, apparently catching herself, the mayor added, ``I'm not
allowed to say that. One of these days, I'm going to tell the
world.''
   The 70-year-old Democrat became mayor after Richard S. Caliguiri
died in May. She recently scheduled, then canceled, formal
announcement of her candidacy.
   Asner, who plays a rough-talking scrap dealer in ``Born
Yesterday,'' went into character when he met the mayor.
   ``You're the broad?'' he said good-naturedly. ``You're a lot
classier broad than I thought. I think we can do business.''
   ``You want a cut?'' the mayor responded. ``We don't do business
that way in Pittsburgh. We're strictly honest, clean, squeaky
clean.''

   Country music star George Strait could add
another prize to his collection after bagging a whitetail deer with
unusually large antlers.
   ``This is not just something you throw out in the garage for 20
years then you throw out with the trash. This is a trophy, it will
be like a family heirloom someday,'' LaSalle County Sheriff Darwin
Avant said Wednesday.
   Strait shot a buck with 14-point antlers on Thanksgiving Day. The
rack measured 18 inches across, officials said.
   The animal was measured in LaSalle County, about 60 miles
southwest of San Antonio, for the Los Casadores Trophy Whitetail
Deer Contest, which continues through the end of the year.
   ``In my estimation, this will probably be the deer with the
biggest rack that's killed in Texas this year,'' Avant said.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached On New Contract for Guild-Covered Staff at AP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and the Wire Service Guild
agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement covering 1,400
employees, including the news service's domestic reporting and
editing staff.
   The two-year accord came minutes before midnight Wednesday, when
the preceding pact was to expire. The Guild's negotiating committee
voted to recommend the agreement for approval by its membership.
   The new contract provides the AP news staff with a top-minimum
salary of $720 per week, after increases of $27 a week in the first
year and $25 a week in the second year. In addition, the agreement
provided significant increases for AP's non-news personnel.
   Among fringe benefit improvements, the contract provides for
extension of dental health coverage to cover part of the cost of
orthodontic treatment, and a doubling of the eye-care reimbursement
benefit to $100 annually.
   New benefits were creation of a non-matching 401K retirement
savings plan and establishment of an account to provide tax deferred
benefits to staffers making arrangements for child care or other
dependent care.
   AP also established a 100 percent reimbursement for certain
preventive cancer screening tests.
   Aside from the general increase, the agreement also provides for
improvements in the economic differential received by AP news
staffers in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and
San Francisco. Staffers in New York and Washington received
increases of $10 in the first year and $12 in the second year,
providing a total differential of $87.
   In Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco, the increase
was $5 in the first year and $7 in the second year, providing a
total differential of $45.
   The contract agreement also resolved a unit clarification
petition filed by the AP and a companion petition filed by the
Guild. The petitions asked the National Labor Relations Board to
clarify the supervisory status of AP News editors and
correspondents, a subject that had been considered but not
definitively resolved by the NLRB in 1982.
   The Guild and the AP agreed that all news editors and
correspondents supervising three or more employes would be exempt
from Guild jurisdiction and thus become members of AP management.
Correspondents who supervise smaller AP operations would remain in
Guild jurisdiction, the parties agreed.
   NLRB hearings, set to begin in December, will be canceled as a
result of the agreement, in which the AP said news editors or
correspondents who wished to maintain their place in the Guild
bargaining unit could relinquish their supervisory duties and
transfer to regular staff positions.
   The parties also resolved several significant pension issues,
striking a mandatory contribution clause that required the AP to
contribute $2,881 per week to a pension trust that was already fully
funded. The parties further agreed that funds held in the AP account
in The Newspaper Guild Commingled Fund could be used for payments of
pension benefits and expenses, retroactive through 1988.
   Bargaining on the contract began in October. The guild was
represented by AP news staffers from around the nation who are
members of the union.

   The dollar declined marginally against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Thursday, and prices fell slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 37.44 points
or 0.13 percent, closing at 29,541.46. On Wednesday, the index
closed at a record high of 29,578.90.
   The dollar finished the day at 121.57 yen, down 0.28 yen from
Wednesday's closing. The U.S. currency stayed within a range of
121.28-121.60 yen after opening lower at 121.28 yen.
   In New York Wednesday, the dollar fell after a big sell order
from the Bank of England, which was attempting to keep the British
pound from rising against the West German mark, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, many market participants remained on the sidelines
awaiting the release of the U.S. unemployment rate for November,
said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. The U.S. Labor Department is
scheduled to announce the jobless rate on Friday.
   ``The dollar rose slightly after some trading companies bought
the currency, but the dollar-yen rate did not move very much,'' said
the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, share prices fell mainly due to
profit-taking following the index's gain earlier in the week, said
an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   ``In addition, participants were reluctant to buy issues because
of the approaching release of the U.S. jobless rate,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

   NASA's first black shuttle commander
and nine space rookies are among the astronauts chosen to fly on
four missions in 1989 and early 1990.
   Frederick D. Gregory, an Air Force colonel who piloted Challenger
on a flight in April 1985, will command a Department of Defense
mission on Discovery set to launch Aug. 10, 1989. The 47-year-old
Gregory will be the space agency's first black shuttle commander,
NASA announced Wednesday.
   The four other crew members assigned to the mission are pilot S.
David Griggs, and mission specialists F. Story Musgrave, Kathryn C.
Thornton and Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr. It will be the first
flight for Ms. Thornton and Carter.
   Commanding a mission scheduled to fly Oct. 12, 1989, will be Navy
Capt. Donald E. Williams, who flew one previous mission as a pilot
aboard Discovery in 1985. The five-person crew plans to deploy the
planetary probe Galileo, which will make its way to Jupiter.
   Michael J. McCulley, a Navy commander, will make his first flight
on Atlantis as the pilot. Shannon W. Lucid, Frankling Chang-Diaz and
space rookie Ellen S. Baker were named mission specialists.
   Navy Capt. Daniel C. Brandenstein, the current chief of the
astronaut office at NASA's Johnson Space Center, will command
Columbia on a flight planned for Nov. 13, 1989. The five-person crew
will deploy a satellite and retrieve the Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   The other crew members will be Navy Lt. Cmdr. James D. Wetherbee,
the pilot, and mission specialists Bonnie J. Dunbar, G. David Low
and Marsha S. Ivins. It will be the first shuttle flight for
Wetherbee, Low and Ms. Ivins.
   Navy Capt. Jon A. McBride will command Columbia on another flight
set to launch March 1, 1990. Air Force Col. Guy S. Gardner, assigned
to the current Atlantis flight, will be McBride's pilot.
   Space veterans John M. Lounge, Jeffrey A. Hoffman and Robert A.R.
Parker will be mission specialists on the flight. Lounge has flown
on two previous flights, including the first post-Challenger mission
aboard Discovery, which launched in late September.
   The payload specialists assigned to the mission, which will
feature use of the ASTRO-1 ultraviolet astronomy telescope, are
rookies Ronald A. Parise and Samuel T. Durrance.

   Security at the Kennedy Space Center
was increased to protect the shuttle Atlantis and its military
secrets from terrorists, spies and even American journalists.
   ``Security is additive to Department of Defense flights,'' Gary
Wistrand, deputy director for security services, said Wednesday.
``We always have security for any shuttle flight as a national
resource. For a DOD launch, people can't access areas where they
would see classified data.''
   Information about the launch _ the third entirely military
shuttle mission _ was sharply restricted, with none of the usual
pre-flight briefings and news conferences. The precise liftoff time
was to be kept secret until nine minutes before launch.
   German shepherds trained to sniff out bombs checked the bags of
some journalists and other workers arriving before the launch.
   News media organizations setting up remote unmanned cameras to
photograph the Atlantis liftoff had to sign Defense Department
releases Wednesday giving up their film in case of an accident that
could allow photographs of the payload _ believed to be a $500
million spy satellite. The Associated Press and The New York Times
refused to sign the release and weren't allow to place their cameras.
   ``We are trying to make it as hard as possible for potential
adversaries to find out,'' said Air Force Lt. Ron Rand. ``We do what
we do because it serves the best interests of the U.S.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration security force
boosts the number of personnel on duty for a military launch by
about 25 percent, Wistrand said, with the Department of Defense
paying for the extra guard. He said more than 100 security
personnel, from gate guards to plainsclothes investigators, were
assigned to the Atlantis launch.
   The gate guards carry revolvers and Special Weapons and Tactics
teams have automatic weapons. Wistrand said he doesn't recall any
major security problems during a shuttle mission, although guards
arrested 186 protesters two years ago for trespassing on government
property in a protest against the Trident 2 missile launch at the
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
   Guarding against terrorism is always a consideration, Wistrand
said, although the shuttle isn't considered a vulnerable target.
   ``I think that anytime you have a piece of hardware that is
valued the amount of the shuttle is, that is a potential target, but
we don't have any intelligence to that effect,'' Wistrand said.
   ``I do think it presents a rather difficult target,'' he said.
   In addition to the manned patrols, the mostly wild and swampy
140,000-acre space center terrain has its own natural guard force.
   ``We have about 7,000 alligators, some rattlesnakes, and some
wild hogs,'' Wistrand said.

   The Vietnamese government has released a
Roman Catholic archbishop after 13 years in prison without trial,
the Vatican Radio said.
   The radio said Wednesday that Archbishop Francesco Saverio Nguyen
Van Thuan, 60, was released by police around mid-November.
   Van Thuan was promoted to the position of archbishop-coadjutor in
Ho Chi Minh City in April of 1975 and was arrested several months
later, the report said.
   In the early 1970s, Nguyen Van Thuan was assigned by the
Vietnamese bishop's conference to help victims of the Vietnam War
and was considered ``anti-revolutionary'' by the communist
authorities, the report said.
   The report said that during the 13 years, Nguyen Van Thuan was
held in prison, re-education camps, and under house arrest.
   The news of Nguyen Van Thuan's release reached the Vatican
through Cardinal Trinh Van Can, archbishop of Hanoi, the report said.

   Third-grader Victoria Kennedy told her
classmates in a hushed voice how her grandmother looked at wedding
pictures and could not remember the names of her own family members.
   Matthew Ouelette, another Westport Elementary School pupil,
recalled how his neighbor, an elderly woman, ``forgot how to
drive,'' and ``forgot how to cook.''
   Like practically everyone in their coastal town of 1,850
residents, the pupils were talking about Alzheimer's disease as part
of a day-long series of events Wednesday put together by educators,
doctors and a drug company.
   ``This is a test to see how much you can educate an entire town
in one day,'' said William Connolly of New Jersey-based Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals Corp.
   The program used coloring books, a mascot dog and movies to show
how the debilitating ailment can be battled. For a few hours, the
students put aside their reading, writing and arithmetic to look at
a disease that may not afflict them for 60 years, if at all.
   The children wanted to know how Alzheimer's disease gets started
and, as it happens, that was one question that could not be answered
definitively.
   The purpose of the effort was not so much to understand how the
disease works but to show how the loved ones of an Alzheimer's
sufferer can, with patience, helpful advice and love, minimize the
worst of the disease's effects.
   Westport, which is in the third year of a federal Health and
Human Services grant intended to promote community programs,
developed the Alzheimer's effort in meetings between school
officials and Connolly, who spends summers here. Sandoz manufactures
Hydergine, a drug that can ease some symptoms of Alzheimer's in
milder cases.
   For adults, Wednesday's program included discussions on
``positive approaches to aging,'' a film titled ``There Were Times
Dear,'' dramatizing a family coping with Alzheimer's, and a lecture
by Dr. William Gershell, a specialist in geriatrics at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York City.
   Alzheimer's afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly
Americans. Efforts are expanding to help them cope. Until recently,
the focus was on patients, not their families.
   Westport is changing that emphasis because of mounting evidence
that children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline
of a loved one.
   A coloring book titled ``Helping Grandma,'' by Westport High
School art teacher Betsey MacDonald, told the story of a grandmother
who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss.
   ``Children are often kept in the dark about aging,'' said
MacDonald. ``They automatically think that `old' means `sick.' But
children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when
spoken to directly on the subject.''
   The point of the coloring book, geared toward elementary school
children, is to ``teach them understanding and to teach them that
what she needs is support.''
   Connolly said a key problem with the disease is the failure to
recognize that it is a problem.
   ``The feeling is that to be old is to be sick and to be old is to
be confused,'' Connolly said. Children ask what is wrong with an
elderly relative and ``parents say, `Well, Grandma's getting old.'
That's not true.''
   One of the first things relatives can do for those showing signs
of memory loss or other dementia is encourage them to go to a doctor.
   Also, mature, well-behaved dogs from an animal shelter can
provide some stability and love for an Alzheimer's sufferer,
Connolly said. Jeff, a black and white mongrel from a Rhode Island
animal shelter, has become the national poster dog for the so-called
human-animal bonding campaign, and he travels with Connolly to
events on the subject.
   The Alzheimer's event in this southern Massachusetts community
was the second of its kind. Connolly, MacDonald and Jeff tried out
the program earlier this fall in Bloomington, Ind.

<HEAD>Slain Girl Had Been Kidnapped in Similar Incident in 1987, Officers
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A five-year-old girl who was kidnapped
from her home for the second time in two years was found dead of
strangulation and massive head injuries beside a road, authorities
say.
   The body of Lottie Margaret Rhodes, a kindergarten student, was
found hours after she was kidnapped from her bedroom Wednesday,
Arlington police said. She had been left beside an isolated road
three miles away in neighboring Grand Prairie.
   Police said the girl had also been kidnapped from her home in
1987 by an unknown assailant and released.
   The girl's mother, Toni Rhodes, 23, told police that someone
broke into the apartment through the child's bedroom window sometime
between 2 a.m. Wednesday, when a live-in baby-sitter checked on the
girl, and 8 a.m., when Ms. Rhodes discovered her daughter missing.
   Ms. Rhodes told authorities that the kidnapper had placed some
stuffed animals under the covers on the girl's bed in an apparent
attempt to make it appear that the girl was still in the bed.
   A baby-sitter, Joe Martinez, 18, had been caring for the girl and
her three-year-old brother while the mother worked at an Arlington
diner.
   Neighbors told authorities they did not hear anything unusual
during the night, although one said his dog started barking at 2
a.m. But he said he did not see anything unusual when he checked the
area by looking through a window.
   The Dallas County medical examiner's office ruled the death a
homicide, saying that an autopsy determined that the girl died of
asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, and ``crush force'' injuries to the
head.
   Arlington police spokesman Dee Anderson said evidence also
indicated the girl had been run over by a vehicle.
   Police said they had no leads and no suspects in the case and
could not say whether the homicide was related to the 1987 incident,
in which the girl was found on June 22 wandering about five miles
from her home.
   Then four, the child told police that a thin, black-haired man
about 19 years old, driving a small brown car, had kidnapped her
about 9:30 a.m. outside her apartment. The man released her an hour
later, Anderson said.
   Medical evidence indicated the girl may have been sexually
assaulted in the earlier kidnapping, he said. Police never
apprehended the abductor, Anderson said.
   Police said they had no information on the girl's father, who
neighbors said did not live with the family.

<TEXT>
   The major issues between the United States and
Mexico that President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari will face as
he begins his term:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FOREIGN DEBT _ Mexico owes foreign creditors about $102 billion;
about one-third of that is owed to U.S. banks and the U.S.
government. Mexico paid out about $13 billion in interest and
principal to service the debt this year, money that is needed to
revive economic growth and quiet demands for a better standard of
living. Salinas hopes to negotiate reduced payments and expects a
sympathetic ear from President-elect George Bush.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MIGRATION _ Mexico resents the way the United States treats the
vast flow of migrants that enter the United States in search of
jobs. Salinas believes that continued migration should be recognized
and legalized for better control. The problem will not be solved
until the Mexican economy starts growing strongly enough to provide
jobs and keep workers at home.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DRUG TRAFFICKING _ The United States has accused Mexico of
failing to try hard enough to stop drug trafficking. Mexico believes
the United States has failed to recognize the root of the problem _
tremendous U.S. demand. Salinas has promised to increase enforcement
efforts and fight corruption; the United States is paying more
attention to controlling demand.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TRADE _ Mexico badly needs access to U.S. markets to boost
industrial exports and further reduce its dependence on oil revenue.
Salinas fears protectionist sentiment in the United States will hurt
that effort.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CENTRAL AMERICA _ Mexico believes the United States has followed
an arrogant policy and should consult more with Central American
nations. The Reagan administration accused Mexico of doing
everything it could to obstruct U.S. policy, especially on
Nicaragua, where U.S.-backed guerrillas have been trying to topple
the government. The issue is likely to be less of an irritant under
Bush and Salinas, both less committed to previous policies.

<TEXT>
   The City Council has voted 6-3 to approve a
measure that would allow authorities to destroy pit bulls that
aren't registered, licensed and tattooed.
   The measure, passed Wednesday and headed to Mayor Coleman Young
for approval, would set top penalties of 90 days in jail and a $200
fine for pit bull owners who don't comply with the ordinance.
Violations would be a misdemeanor.
   An ordinance that would have banned the fierce breed was defeated
5-3 in October. It was proposed after a series of pit bull attacks
on people, including a 2-year-old hospitalized for about two weeks
after suffering neck, back and chest bites.
   Young has 30 days to act on the measure.

   A gas explosion ripped through a coal mine in
northeast China, killing 45 workers and injuring 23, an official
Chinese report said today.
   The domestic China News Service, in a report appearing in the
Chinese-language New Evening Post newspaper, said the explosion
occurred Saturday afternoon in Jixi city, about 840 miles northeast
of Beijing.
   The report said the cause of the explosion was under
investigation and that top provincial officials went to the site to
help with the probe.
   No other details were provided in the brief report. The news
service did not say why the accident was not reported earlier.
   There have been several other fatal mine explosions in China this
year. More than 50 people died in a mine blast near Guiyang in
southern China's Guizhou province in May.
   A few weeks later, 49 people were killed in a coal mine explosion
in northern Shanxi province. In August, 44 miners died when a gas
explosion devastated a coal mine in western China's Gansu province.

   Help has come nun-too-soon for the sisters
at a small, Catholic women's college stuck with 94,000 cookbooks and
a printer's bill for $400,000 from a fund-raising project that went
awry.
   ``I call it `felix culpa.' It's a Latin expression meaning `happy
fault,''' said Sister Judith O'Connell, assistant development
director for Our Lady of the Elms College, on Wednesday.
   Since the sisters' plight was reported in mid-November, Sister
Judith said she has received hundreds of mail orders daily for the
350-recipe book, ``In Good Taste.''
   ``If it keeps up, we could sell all the cookbooks,'' she said.
``We really do believe in miracles.''
   Although too swamped to take an exact tally, she said more than
5,000 orders already have been filled and some companies have
approached the sisters about distributing the book.
   One man sent a check for $500 for 25 books.
   ``He said that he had been educated by one of the sisters that is
now working at the college,'' Sister Judith said.
   The Sisters of St. Joseph, who run the 750-student college, had
hoped to raise $1 million for scholarships through sales of the
cookbook at $10 a copy. But they only sold 6,000 copies in 12
months, and Sister Mary Dooley, college president, acknowledged the
100,000-book printing may have been ``over optimistic.''

   A small helium balloon launched by
elementary school students carried a birthday greeting 1,500 miles
in two days, landing eventually in Saskatchewan, Canada, officials
said.
   ``The students were shocked that it would go that far,'' said Ed
Little, principal of the Martin Luther King Elementary School.
``They thought that it would go as far as Eastern Washington. But to
have it go to Saskatchewan, Canada, was quite a thrill for them.''
   Each of the school's 450 students released a helium balloon Nov.
10 bearing the school's blue and yellow colors to mark Veterans Day
and the start of the state centennial, Little said.
   Inside the balloons was the message: ``Happy 100th birthday
Washington State from the students and staff of Martin Luther King
Elementary School.''
   One of the balloons reached the farm of Donna Forrester, who sent
the school a letter that said her daughter found the balloon while
riding a horse on Nov. 12.
   ``She was very pleased, to say the least, and we were all amazed
that it had come this far,'' Forrester wrote. ``We estimated it
traveled about 1,500 miles.''
   Forrester enclosed a map of Saskatchewan indicating that her farm
is about 8 miles north of the U.S.-Canada border along North Dakota.
   The students now are getting a lesson in geography and
international relations _ two teachers used the map for a lesson in
Canadian geography and the students were assigned to send a note
back to Saskatchewan.

<HEAD>Researcher Recommends Hats and Sunglasses To Prevent Cataracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who wear hats and sunglasses to protect
their eyes from strong sunshine could substantially reduce the risk
of cataracts, says the author of a study published today.
   The research, conducted on fishermen, found that frequent
exposure to intense sun tripled the risk of a common form of
cataracts, strengthening the widely held suspicion that too much sun
is bad for the eyes, just as it is for the skin.
   ``If there is enough sunshine for you to get sunburned, then you
should be protecting your eyes,'' said Dr. Hugh R. Taylor of Johns
Hopkins University.
   He noted that many people have gotten used to smearing sunblock
on their faces to prevent skin cancer. But they leave their eyes
exposed to damaging ultraviolet light, the invisible portion of the
sunbeam that burns the skin and slowly clouds the lens of the eyes.
   Taylor said the easiest way to protect the eyes is to put on a
hat with a brim.
   ``That will cut UV exposure to the eye by 50 percent. And if you
get sunglasses, you can eliminate all ocular UV exposure or cut it
down by 80 percent to 90 percent,'' he said in an interview.
   Cataracts are a common health problem, resulting in more than 1
million operations in the United States each year.
   Taylor and colleagues estimated the annual ultraviolet exposures
of 838 Chesapeake Bay watermen, who work on boats. These varied,
depending on how much they fished, the time of year they were on the
water and whether they wore hats and glasses, among other factors.
   Doctors found no association between sunlight and cataracts of
the nucleus of the lens. However, they found that it was strongly
associated with cataracts of the surrounding cortex of the lens.
   Cortical and nuclear cataracts each account for about one-third
of all cases that require surgery. Not enough fishermen in the study
had a third variety of eye damage, known as posterior subcapsular
cataracts, to determine whether they also are caused by sunlight.
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
found that the higher the men's exposure to ultraviolet light, the
greater their risk of cortical cataracts.
   The researchers divided the watermen into four groups, depending
on the intensity of their exposure. The quarter with the highest
annual exposure had three times the risk of those in the group with
the lowest exposure.
   The research showed that people who got cortical cataracts
received, on average, 21 percent more ultraviolet light than those
who did not. Doubling the annual ultraviolet exposure increased the
cataract risk by 60 percent.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Sidney Lerman of New York
Medical College wrote that prevention of light damage to the eye
``is the best and simplest approach to the problem.''
   Taylor said that all glasses, including ordinary reading glasses,
cut exposure significantly, although they vary in effectiveness. The
best are plastic lenses specifically designed to block ultraviolet
rays. These can stop virtually all of these rays from reaching the
eyes.
   He said that ordinary, untinted glass spectacles stop about 80
percent of ultraviolet radiation, while similar plastic lenses keep
out 90 percent. Run-of-the-mill cheap sunglasses block about 95
percent.

<HEAD>Dismissed Dental Student Files Suit over AIDS Exposure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A student who was dismissed from the Washington
University dental school for treating patients after testing
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus has sued the school for $3
million in damages.
   The student, whose name is listed in the suit as John Doe, claims
the school improperly barred him from its dental program last
summer. Attorney Norman London contends his client is handicapped
and cannot be discriminated against.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in St. Louis Circuit Court, also names
Washington University chancellor William Danforth and David A.
Bensinger, dean of the dental school. The suit does not seek to have
the student reinstated, but asks for $3 million in damages,
contending the use of rubber gloves and other protective devices
makes the risk of transmitting the virus negligible.
   School officials said the student treated 27 patients at the
dental school for about a year after contracting the disease.
   Bensinger said the student tested positive for antibodies to the
human immunodefiency syndrome _ HIV _ in late March or early April.
The student was dismissed from the school in August and was not
allowed to enroll for the current school year.
   Students and instructional faculty members provide dental care at
the school's clinic.
   University officials refused to comment on the suit. Peter Ruger,
the university's general counsel, said that the dental school was
well within its rights in barring the student from treating patients
and pursuing his education.

   A man officials contended was once the acting
boss of the Brooklyn-based Colombo crime family has been missing for
more than two weeks and is believed to have been murdered, according
to a newspaper report today.
   James Angellino, 52, was seen Nov. 15 leaving his office at the
Greater Blouse, Skirt and Undergarment Association Inc. in
Manhattan's garment district. He was accompanied by another man in
his 40s.
   Angellino's girlfriend reported him missing Nov. 18, the Daily
News reported. The two had been living together in Brooklyn since
his release from federal prison May 5.
   Angellino's car was found recently in a Manhattan garage but
police and FBI agents did not find any trace of the missing man. The
investigation is continuing.
   ``We haven't found a body but we believe he's gone forever,'' an
unidentified Justice Department official told the News.
   Angellino and reputed Colombo captain Joseph Tomasello were
convicted in 1986 of conspiring to buy supposedly stolen
videocassette recorders in an FBI sting, for which both men served
approximately 10 months in jail.
   ``During the prosecution we contended that for a period of time
Angellino was the acting boss of the family'' in place of imprisoned
boss Carmine Persico, said Edward McDonald, chief of the Brooklyn
Organized Crime Strike Force, which prosecuted the two.
   According to court records, the Greater Blouse association, a
trade association of about 700 ladies' garment manufacturers, is
jointly controlled by the Gambino, Genovese and Colombo crime
families. The records identify Angellino as the Colombo
representative, the News said.
   Neither McDonald nor Angellino's lawyer, Frank Lopez, would
comment about the disappearance, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says
constitutional and electoral reforms are ``a kind of oxygen'' to
revive the body politic, but it is unlikely they alone can make his
society any more democratic.
   Since the proposed reforms appeared on Oct. 22-23, Soviet society
has been engaged in a remarkable debate over an overhaul of the
electoral system and the structure of the government that Gorbachev
says is the first big step toward making Soviet society into one
governed by law rather than dictate.
   The 1,500 members of the Supreme Soviet parliament today
overwhelmingly approved the package, the amended version of which
still has not been published in the official press.
   Gorbachev's promise is a weighty one in a society now reopening
the emotional and physical scars of Josef Stalin's purges and still
suffering from a much more recent history of systematic jailing or
exile of dissidents and overbearing bureaucracy.
   But political reforms do not guarantee change.
   Political repression has been imposed in a Soviet system that on
paper guaranteed citizens' rights. The Communist Party has shown no
interest in sharing power.
   And operating in the current system, critics have used
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness, to force
some changes in his proposals.
   ``Political reform is a kind of oxygen needed by the public
organism,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday, the first
day of a special session to consider the reform package.
   ``If we do not carry out political reform to back up the
processes that are now under way in the economy, the social
transformation of society and the recuperation in the cultural
field, and fail to radically update the activities of the governing
councils and our personnel, the drive for restructuring will
inevitably begin to skid,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said his solution is ``our own socialist system of
`checks and balances' ... designed to protect society against any
violations of socialist legality at the highest state level.''
   He called for the formation of a Congress of People's Deputies, a
new 2,250-member legislative body formed not only in elections from
geographic districts and ethnic territories, but from organizations
such as the Communist Party and trade unions.
   Draft legislation gave the presidency, which Gorbachev assumed
Oct. 1, considerably more power, and appeared as well to strengthen
Moscow's hand with the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union.
   The proposals loosened an avalanche of more than 300,000
suggestions from across the Soviet Union, and protests from at least
a third of the republics that some of the reforms fostered the
opposite of Gorbachev's proclaimed intention to give local
authorities more power.
   In the spirit of ``glasnost,'' Soviet leaders got an earful of
criticism that led them to amend about half of the almost 120
articles before introducing them to the Supreme Soviet on Monday. In
two days of rare debate, deputies of the Supreme Soviet offered many
more.
   ``The discussion itself, I'll tell you frankly, is
unprecedented,'' Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov told a news
conference.
   The tiny Baltic republic of Estonia, where Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness already encouraged a grassroots political movement
to demand greater autonomy, has declared itself ``sovereign'' in
internal affairs and proclaiming the right to pass judgment on new
Soviet laws.
   Similar organizations in the other Baltic republics of Latvia and
Lithuania were close behind but could not push the legislation
through their parliaments.
   The Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet declared Estonia's
action unconstitutional.
   Gorbachev also must rein in the Communist Party and government
bureaucracies that are stubbornly resistant to change.
   The president told the Supreme Soviet that many initiatives from
working people ``are being lost in bureaucratic mazes, or are even
encountering resistance.''
   He won approval at the June party conference for a plan to get
the party out of day-to-day management of government and economic
affairs, concentrating instead on setting policy. He has called for
taking power from the Moscow and giving it to local economic
managers along with the responsibility of ensuring they make enough
money to pay for their operations.
   But the Soviet leader regularly expresses frustration with both
the party and government bureaucracy's slow pace of change.

   A rotten holiday season awaits anyone who
steals an evergreen tree planted at parks in Hutchinson.
   Workers this week will begin spraying evergreens throughout the
park system with a chemical retardant that puts off an odor similar
to rotten eggs when exposed to temperatures above 50 degrees.
   The non-toxic spray, primarily designed to ward off hungry
rabbits and deer, has become an effective tool for the city in its
battle to prevent evergreen tree thefts during the Christmas
holiday, said city parks superintendent Tom Heintzman.
   ``If the tree happens to be cut down and taken into a home, at
temperatures of 50 degrees it gives off a very noxious odor,''
Heintzman said.
   Hutchinson, a town of about 40,000 residents 50 miles northwest
of Wichita, started the spraying program in 1986 after thieves cut
down six evergreen trees in city parks, Heintzman said.

   Police said today they arrested 180
youths in street fights between ultra-rightists and opponents in
central Stockholm.
   Sixteen policemen were hospitalized for injuries from smoke bombs
in Wednesday night's riot, the national news agency TT said. No
injuries were reported among the rioters.
   Police Superintendent Evert Karlen said the clash centered on a
park where the nationalist Swedish Socialist Workers Party had
gathered to honor Karl XII, an 18th century ruler known as the
``King of Wars.''
   He said about 100 members of the ultra-rightist party and 250
opponents of the group threw stones and snowballs at each other
after the annual gathering.
   The Swedish king was slain in a battle in Norway in 1718, after a
life of warring in Russia and Poland. For the Socialist Workers
Party, supported by bands of ``skinheads,'' Karl XII is a symbol of
national power.
   A group of 50 youths, wearing green jackets and close-cropped
hair, later stormed into the central subway station and smashed up
one car before police surrounded them, Karlen said.
   ``Most of these youths, on both sides, have no idea why they
fight,'' Karlen said. ``And they haven't got the slightest idea who
Karl XII is.''

   Anyone can die; living is the tough part,
according to exercise guru Jack Lalanne.
   LaLanne, 73, and his 62-year-old wife, Elaine, say they feel like
spring chickens and want others to feel that way, too.
   ``Habits, habits, habits. That's what it's all about is habits,''
said LaLanne during a recent telephone interview from his Southern
California home.
   ``If you're sick, tired, unattractive, whose fault is it? God's?
The devil's? There's only one person that can account for you and
that's you,'' said LaLanne, an exercise and diet evangelist for more
than 50 years.
   A staple in his pep-talk routine is to pump up non-exercisers
with words of encouragement.
   ``Pride and discipline. That's the key. When you lose pride in
life, you lose everything. Have you ever watched the birds, the
animals. How clean they are? They have that pride in what they can
do,'' said LaLanne, who is scheduled to give a lecture here Monday.
   Lalanne, who has lent his name to health and fitness centers, as
well as television workout programs, has developed his own program
of walking in combination with other exercises, but he said the key
is getting off the couch and sticking to a nutritious diet.
   ``Anything is good if you do it consistently,'' LaLanne said.
``You'd be surprised what can happen in 30 days if you just do
something about it.''

   A 26-year-old baker has been charged with
raping a mentally retarded woman who became an acquaintance through
conversations on a telephone ``party line,'' police reported.
   Timothy Moals of Columbia was charged with second-degree rape in
the Nov. 21 incident outside the victim's mobile home, said Sgt.
Joseph H. Bisesi, a spokesman for Anne Arundel County police.
   Moals was charged with second-degree rape ``because she is
mentally handicapped and therefore incapable of consent to the
act,'' court records said.
   Bisesi said that before the attack, Moals and the woman had
spoken three or four times on ``The Party Line,'' a Baltimore-based
telephone introduction service that enables up to eight people to
carry on a conversation at once.
   Moals subsequently telephoned the woman directly and invited
himself to her house, Bisesi said. The 20-year-old victim later told
her mother she had been raped in front of a storage shed, and the
mother notified police, he said.
   Moals was arrested at his home late Tuesday. District Court Judge
Lawrence R. Rushworth on Wednesday set bail at $10,000 and ordered
Moals to submit to a psychological examination to determine his
competence to stand trial.
   Web Chamberlin, a spokesman for the Chesapeake & Potomac
Telephone Co., said ``The Party Line'' is sponsored by a New York
resident, Brendan Corrigan.
   Chamberlin said that although telephone introduction services
have come under increasing scrutiny lately, he had never heard of a
crime being committed as a result of the relationships forged
through them.

<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg's former live-in lover rehearsed
her prosecution testimony, anticipating the most dramatic
confrontation in his trial on charges he beat his 6-year-old
illegally adopted daughter to death.
   Hedda Nussbaum, who has not faced Steinberg in more than a year,
was expected to testify today that he beat Lisa Steinberg to death.
   ``That confrontation will be electrifying,'' New York University
law professor Stephen Gillers said Wednesday. ``That experience
could free her. Telling her story could be cleansing.''
   ``She is the key, crucial witness,'' state judge Harold Rothwax
said during pretrial hearings.
   Nussbaum, 46, spent about 10 minutes Wednesday with a detective,
prosecutors and her lawyers in the Manhattan courtroom where the
trial is being held and spent eight hours with prosecutors outside
the courtroom, according to several reports. There were no
proceedings in the case Wednesday.
   Steinberg has denied he hit Lisa. He says she fell unconscious
after choking on food the night of Nov. 1, 1987, and that he caused
the bruises on her chest and back while trying futilely to revive
her.
   Lisa, described as a bright, outgoing first-grader, was removed
bruised, unconscious and barely breathing early the next morning
from the Greenwich Village apartment Steinberg and Nussbaum shared.
The girl was pronounced dead at a hospital three days later.
   Police also found a 16-month-old boy the couple raised in the
apartment.
   Steinberg's attorneys have suggested during the trial that
Nussbaum struck the blow that killed Lisa.
   ``She's nervous,'' Nussbaum's attorney, Barry Scheck, said
Wednesday.
   In the weeks following Steinberg's arrest last year, ``Hedda felt
protective about Joel,'' Scheck said.
   ``Despite the almost total destruction of her personality by
Joel, her feelings have changed,'' he continued. ``She's come to
have a lot greater insight into her relationship with Joel.''
   Nussbaum has spent the past year recovering from the
psychological and physical injuries which Scheck blamed on
Steinberg. She has had several operations, faces more, and has been
living at a nursing facility.
   In a $3.6 million lawsuit filed against Steinberg this week,
Nussbaum charged he beat her, brainwashed her, plied her with drugs
and made her beg for food. She said Steinberg forced her to take ice
water baths if he caught her eating without permission.
   The jury hearing the murder trial saw a police videotape showing
serious wounds and bruises over Nussbaum's body which Scheck says
were inflicted by Steinberg.
   Steinberg, 47, is a disbarred lawyer who illegally obtained Lisa
at birth from a Long Island teen-ager. The child's natural mother,
Michele Launders, now 27, watches the trial daily from a front row
seat.

<HEAD>Justice Training Council Approves Police Cadet Training Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEEDHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state council on police training
approved reforms, including minimum physical fitness standards for
cadets and certification for instructors, in the wake of a
25-year-old cadet's death.
   The Criminal Justice Training Council voted overwhelmingly for
the new measures in this Boston suburb Wednesday as a coroner's
inquest into the death of Cadet Timothy Shepard continued in
Springfield.
   The council reiterated its abolition of ``modified stress
training,'' which combined constant exercise with unexpected
situations and conflicting orders.
   Such methods were partly blamed for the dehydration suffered by
cadets at the Agawam training academy near Springfield in September.
   Shepard collapsed on the first day of training Sept. 19 at the
academy after a day of rigorous training with few breaks for water.
He died six weeks later of complications from heat stroke, a coroner
has ruled.
   Fifteen other cadets were hospitalized the first week of training.
   The measures approved Wednesday are part of a 120-day ``action
plan'' which will go into effect with the start of new training
classes in January, according to Peter W. Agnes Jr., the council's
interim executive director.
   The plan is intended to become part of a permanent, comprehensive
program for teaching police recruits.
   ``We will have made a clean break with the past,'' Agnes told
council members and a panel that included Attorney General James
Shannon. ``We will set the agenda for the future by laying the
groundwork now.''
   Among other rules adopted Wednesday:
   _ Injuries to student officers must be documented and recorded;
   _ Physical or academic punishment to teach, enforce or maintain
discipline is prohibited;
   _ Establishment of a new discipline policy, including a
merit-demerit system;
   _ Pre-admission drug screening and physicals by qualified
physicians;
   _ More rigorous rules for academic performance, including
standardization of all written tests;
   _ Creation of new qualifications and certification for all
academy directors and instructors;
   _ All academy directors and instructors must read the attorney
general's report of what happened during training this year;
   _ Pre-admission orientation on physical and academic aspects of
police training.
   The council also accepted the resignation of Assistant Director
James Canty and authorized the dismissals of Judith Crossen,
director of training; Martin Michaelman, pre-screening coordinator
and Earl Harrington, former zone manager for western Massachusetts.
Brian Daley, director of standards, will be reassigned to new
duties, the council said.

   A bandit was ``remorseful, crying and
upset'' that he stole an Impressionist painting worth more than $1
million from a museum, but not sorry enough to turn himself in,
police said.
   Suffolk County Detective Sgt. Gene Gross said the tearful thief
called police Wednesday morning to tell them Edouard Manet's
``Bouquet of Peonies,'' taken Sunday from the Heckscher Museum in
Huntington, could be found at an apartment complex in the New York
City borough of Queens.
   The thief told police the painting could be found in the basement
laundry room, but it was not there when police arrived shortly
before noon, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Daniel
Guido.
   The building's superintendent had found it, Guido said, and put
it in a storage room. The superintendent had thought about hanging
it in his apartment but decided against it because he didn't think
it was attractive.
   Guido said the superintendent was ``quite shocked'' to learn the
value of the painting.
   Heckscher museum Registrar William Titus said the recovered
painting was authentic and undamaged.
   The painting, in its gold frame, measures about 16{ by 21{ inches
and could have been smuggled out of the Long Island museum under a
coat, said police spokesman Lt. William Kiley.
   Police said the thief apparently took the painting from the wall,
walked out a basement door and escaped. Two uniformed guards were
patrolling the five-room exhibition area at the time.
   Investigators are trying to uncover the identity of a blond man
who witnesses said they saw putting a painting into the trunk of a
silver car outside the museum, Guido said.
   But he said police will not use laser equipment to try to
retrieve fingerprints from the painting because it would be a
``cultural felony'' to risk damaging the work.
   Guido said it was ``clearly a miracle that we have recovered the
painting. It is amazing we got it back.''
   The 1880 Manet is a still life of red and pink flowers in a glass
vase. It had been lent to the Heckscher by its owner, who has
remained anonymous.
   The full value of the painting was not made public, but police
and museum officials said it was more than $1 million.

<TEXT>
   Olympic medalist Bruce Kimball, who already
faces drunken-driving manslaughter charges in the deaths of two
teen-agers, has pleaded guilty to throwing an object at a policeman
after a college football game.
   Kimball was seen throwing apples and a plastic, juice-filled
lemon at police officers during a wild celebration at Michigan
Stadium after the University of Michigan Wolverines clinched a trip
to the Rose Bowl with a 38-9 victory over Illinois Nov. 12,
according to police in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Kimball, 25, pleaded guilty Monday in Ann Arbor and is scheduled
to be sentenced Dec. 13 on the misdemeanor charge, which carries a
maximum penalty of 90 days in jail or a maximum fine of $100.
   Kimball, a Michigan alumnus who was a silver medalist in diving
at the 1984 Olympics, faces manslaughter charges stemming from a car
accident in suburban Brandon Aug. 1 that killed two youths and left
four seriously injured.
   Frank Quesada, one of the attorneys defending Kimball on the
manslaughter charges, said the Michigan incident was nothing more
than celebrating at a football game.
   ``He was never on the field and never throwing apples,'' Quesada
said. ``He was among a group of 15 to 18 who were given citations
for throwing rolls of toilet paper. ... It's a common thing, and he
didn't know it was an infraction.''
   Ann Arbor Police Capt. Richard DeGrand said misdemeanors like the
one for which Kimball was cited are not unusual on football
Saturdays.
   Also Wednesday, Tampa Judge Harry Lee Coe III moved the date for
Kimball's manslaughter trial from Dec. 12 to Jan. 9.

   James R. Neely, a high school dropout who
went on to develop heart research procedures used around the world,
died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 52.
   Neely was the senior research scientist at Geisinger Medical
Center's Sigfried and Janet Weis Center for Research. In 1967, he
developed a technique for keeping the hearts of laboratory rats
alive outside the body.
   The procedure allowed researchers to study the effects of heart
attacks in relation to oxygen and other nutrients in the heart,
according to Dr. Howard Morgan, director of the Weis Center.
   Neely's published work on the technique was classified as a
``citation classic'' by the Philadelphia-based Institute for
Scientific Information, which monitors published works on research.
The term means other scientists referred to Neely's work at least
500 times in published articles.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to play
tourist between official functions during his visit next week to
address the United Nations and meet one last time with President
Reagan.
   Gorbachev is due to arrive Tuesday afternoon. The next day he is
scheduled to chat with United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar and Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who is
president of the General Assembly, before addressing the assembly
itself.
   Then comes lunch on Governors Island with President Reagan and
President-elect Bush, according to the tentative itinerary released
by the Soviet U.N. Mission. Coast Guard security plans include
closing the 375-foot Buttermilk Channel, which separates the island
from Brooklyn.
   The Soviet and American first ladies, outgoing and incoming, will
attend a luncheon hosted by Perez de Cuellar's wife.
   In the afternoon, Gorbachev is to visit the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, then it's off to Trump Tower, a glittery monument to venture
capitalism, where developer Donald Trump hopes to show the Communist
leader a swimming pool inside a $19 million apartment and Raisa
Gorbachev the exclusive shops in the peach-colored marble atrium.
   A function at the United Nations, hosted in Gorbachev's honor by
Perez de Cuellar and his wife, is likely that evening.
   On Dec. 8, Gorbachev heads for the inauguration of the National
Exposition of U.S.S.R. Exports. Then it's off for a whirlwind
two-hour tour of Manhattan, including the World Trade Center,
Central Park and Broadway.
   A chat with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., precedes an evening
reception at the Soviet Mission.
   The Gorbachevs are scheduled to leave New York the morning of
Dec. 9.
   The itinerary doesn't mention a proposed visit to the New York
Stock Exchange, but should Gorbachev find the time, the market is
waiting with a warm welcome.
   Richard Torrenzano, a senior vice president of the exchange, said
if Gorbachev stops by, he would be offered a chance to ring the
exchange's bell, provided he's there for the market's 9:30 a.m.
opening or 4 p.m. close.

<HEAD>Jackson Sees `Qualitative Change' Between Bush And Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who once said George Bush was
morally unfit to be president, said today he expects a ``qualitative
change'' on civil rights when Bush takes over from President Reagan.
   Jackson said Bush indicated to him during a White House meeting
Wednesday that he would strengthen the Civil Rights Commission,
engage in a comprehensive anti-drug battle and be more open to
advice on social issues.
   ``I suppose just having lines of communications open is a step
towards being kinder and gentler,'' the former Democratic
presidential candidate said, referring to a pledge Bush made when he
accepted the Republican nomination. Jackson said Reagan has been
``unkind and harsh'' in some of his actions.
   Interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Jackson said
Reagan closed the door against the congressional Black Caucus and
others concerned about civil rights and added, ``I think there will
be a qualitative change'' under Bush.
   He said Bush was ``awfully mum'' during the Reagan years but
added, ``I suppose there's a certain presidential loyalty that goes
along with being vice president.''
   Jackson said he had been encouraged by past meetings with Bush
over Haitian refugees, the extension of voters' rights and the
condition of blacks in South Africa.
   ``I'm concerned that President-elect Bush will now put forth the
initiative to set a new moral tone for our country,'' he said. ``No
one can set a moral tone better than the president can.'' He
described Bush as ``quite positive and quite upbeat'' during their
90-minute discussion.
   ``I am ... persuaded that his commitment to have a credible Civil
Rights Commission is going to make some difference in race relations
in this country,'' he said.
   Jackson said he was also encouraged by Bush's willingness to meet
with hard-pressed farmers.
   ``That kind of openness and access and willingness to expand and
to hear other people certainly is the highest and most effective use
of the pulpit called the White House,'' he said.
   Jackson said Bush did not indicate whom he would pick to lead the
war on drugs, but he said both men agreed it must be someone who has
the complete confidence of the president and the secretary of state.
   He said an anti-drug war that focuses only on children _ an
apparent reference to first lady Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No''
efforts _ was not enough, with $150 billion being spent on drugs.
``Children are not buying that amount,'' he said.
   ``My impression is he (Bush) really wants to fight a
comprehensive drug war, and I'm willing to help in any way I can.''

   The AIDS virus disappeared from the bloodstreams of
10 patients with AIDS or a related disease when they got monthly
transfusions of blood plasma from otherwise healthy carriers of the
virus, researchers said today.
   The researchers said the treatment apparently kills the virus
without causing serious side effects.
   ``It doesn't mean that they don't have any more virus in their
bodies,'' said Dr. Abraham Karpas of the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology, affiliated with Cambridge University. ``But there is no
more free virus in the blood to infect their cells.''
   The plasma, treated to remove viruses, contains high levels of
antibodies that can kill the AIDS virus, Karpas said.
   AIDS patients lack such antibodies in their blood, said Karpas,
who led the research team. Research details appear in December's
issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a U.S.
scientific journal, he said.
   Karpas called the results of his study ``very encouraging,'' but
other AIDS researchers urged caution in interpreting them.
   Dr Bryan Gazzard of St. Stephen's Hospital in London, where the
tests were conducted, said the findings were interesting but that
larger trials must be done before anyone could say the treatment
offered any clinical benefit.
   Dr. James Chin, an epidemiologist with the Geneva-based World
Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, said, ``If it's for
real, (it) deserves to be further evaluated.''
   However, ``I think that there may be a lot of work between some
experimental results like that and what kind of applicability you
would have in the real world,'' he warned in an interview.
   ``We don't know how effective it would be, how long people would
have to take such a product. It could very well be for life. So a
lot of things have to be worked out before we can really offer
people a real ray of hope,'' he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, breaking down its resistance to infection. No cure has been
discovered. Not everyone infected with the AIDS virus goes on to
develop symptoms.
   In trials over the past nine months on six AIDS patients and four
suffering from an early stage of AIDS known as AIDS-related complex,
the virus in the patients' blood ``immediately disappeared ...
following the transfusion of this hyper-immune plasma,'' Karpas said
in an interview.
   The researchers said nine of the 10 patients are still alive,
reasonably well, and out of hospital nine months later. ``Those
patients have remained virus negative now for nine months,'' Karpas
said.
   Karpas said some of patients in the study with early symptoms of
AIDS began producing their own antibodies when injected with the
antibody-rich plasma.
   ``The explanation could be that the neutralizing antibody stopped
the virus infecting more T-cells,'' he said.
   T-cells, which are destroyed by the AIDS virus, are a type of
blood cell essential to the body's immune defenses.
   Karpas said he believes the method could reverse the course of
AIDS in some patients, or ``at least to keep it at bay.''
   He hopes to conduct further tests, comparing the effectiveness of
his treatment with the drug azidothymidine, or AZT, which has been
shown to prolong the lives of AIDS sufferers.
   AZT's drawback is that it is toxic to bone marrow,and causes
anemia.
   But the experimental method, said Karpas, ``is not a drug. It has
no toxic effect whatsoever. It's human plasma. It's like a
transfusion.''
   Karpas said larger-scale tests need to be done, but he said he
saw no reason why the treatment couldn't be made available
immediately.

   Co-speakers, co-chairmen, cooperation. That's
the plan for the restructured Indiana House, its leaders say.
   The House, split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, elected
co-speakers for the first time Wednesday and adopted a special
agreement that redistributes many of the speaker's powers to the
chamber's members.
   Democrat Michael K. Phillips and Republican Paul S. Mannweiler
were named co-speakers by unanimous voice votes in the House, which
went from a 52-48 GOP majority to an even split after the Democrats
picked up two seats in the Nov. 8 election.
   The two men, who negotiated the power-sharing agreement over 2{
days last week, jointly clutched the House gavel and raised it aloft
as the membership stood cheering and applauding.
   ``This is a historic occasion, one in which we all can take a
great deal of pride,'' said Mannweiler, who presided alone as House
speaker the last two years.
   The two men will preside over the chamber on alternate days.
Phillips went first, wielding the gavel after the speaker election.
Mannweiler will get his turn when the House reconvenes Jan. 4.
   The House minority leader for the last 12 years, Phillips quoted
poet Robert Frost in a speech urging ``conciliation, not
confrontation'' during the 1989 session.
   ``We're taking the road less traveled by, and that will make all
the difference,'' he said. ``I'm convinced the system will work.''
   The co-speaker arrangement and a series of rules changes were
negotiated after the House tried unsuccessfully last week to elect a
speaker.
   Under the agreement, each committee will have Republican and
Democratic co-chairmen and equal membership from each party.
   The GOP speaker will appoint committee members from his party and
assign Republican-authored bills to committee. The Democratic
speaker will do the same for his party.
   If a co-chairman does not want to hold a hearing on a bill, his
counterpart from the other party can draw on his allotment of ``wild
cards'' to keep the bill moving.
   A tie vote in a committee will send a bill to the floor without
recommendation. Previously, a bill died if it did not win a majority
vote in committee.
   Once a bill reaches the House floor, the author can control when
it is called down for amendment and a final vote. Formerly, the
speaker controlled the House calendar of bills and exercised his
greatest power by killing bills through refusing to call them for
votes.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Qian arriving in Moscow.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China arrived today
for the first foreign-ministry level talks between the two communist
powers on Soviet soil in 31 years.
   ``China and the Soviet Union, as two great neighboring countries,
must live in peace and good-neighborly relations,'' Qian said in a
statement distributed by the Soviet news agency Tass. ``We are glad
that in recent years Chinese-Soviet relations gradually are
improving. I sincerely hope this visit will end with the expecte
results.''
   Qian was greeted at Moscow's Sheremetyevo 2 airport by Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, with whom he will conduct two days
of talks that will include laying the groundwork for a
Chinese-Soviet summit meeting next year.
   The Chinese foreign minister also said he expects to meet with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Before leaving Beijing, Qian said the focus of his talks will be
the war in Cambodia, the major stumbling block to restoring normal
Chinese-Soviet ties.
   China, the main backer of anti-Vietnamese resistance forces in
Cambodia, insists that Moscow exert pressure on its ally Vietnam to
end its 10-year military occupation of that Southeast Asian country.
   The last Chinese foreign minister to visit Moscow was Chou En-lai
in 1957. No Soviet foreign minister has made an official visit to
Beijing since Andrei Gromyko accompanied then Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev in 1959.
   In 1960, China and the Soviet Union split after Mao Tse-tung
accused Khrushchev of ``revisionism'' and compromising with the
capitalist West. The Soviet Union responded by withdrawing Soviet
engineers and technology from hundreds of joint projects, dealing a
painful blow to China's fragile industrial base.
   Relations reached a low in 1969 when the two sides fought a short
war along their disputed border. Mao called on the nation to prepare
for all-out war, and each side stationed at least 1 million troops
along the border.
   The countries began normalization talks in 1982, opening the way
for a general easing of tensions and a gradual increase in trade,
scientific and cultural exchanges.
   Qian noted that the two sides held vice foreign minister-level
talks in Beijing last August on Cambodia and that he had discussed
the issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in a
meeting at the United Nations in September.
   Both sides, Qian said, ``have indicated their willingness to make
an effort to bring about an early settlement to the Kampuchean
(Cambodian) question on a just and reasonable basis, including the
Vietnam troop withdrawal.''
   Qian also indicated that the first Chinese-Soviet summit since
Khrushchev met Mao in Beijing in 1959 was a certainty, regardless of
further progress on Cambodia. That summit is scheduled next year in
Beijing.
   Asked if the summit was linked to solving the Cambodian question,
Qian said, ``Now the conditions for the summit meeting in the view
of both sides are getting ready and both sides are making
preparations for his summit.''
   He said his visit and a return visit to Beijing, probably next
month, by Shevardnadze ``will all be part of the preparations.''
   Chinese leaders have said a summit could take place in the first
half of 1989. Gorbachev is expected to come to Beijing because
China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, rarely travels abroad.
   China has continued to insist ``three obstacles'' remain, headed
by Cambodia, that must be solved before full normalization can be
realized.
   Moscow has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by
pulling out of Afghanistan and reducing tension along the border by
withdrawing one army division facing China from Soviet ally Mongolia.
   Qian said he will discuss the estimated 50,000 Soviet troops
still in Mongolia, ``which should be pulled out,'' border disputes
and ``the Soviet military gathering along the Chinese-Soviet
border.''

   A woman who spoke out in favor of
housing desegregation in Yonkers has been charged with fabricating a
death threat after being videotaped vandalizing her own home.
   A complaint filed Wednesday in federal court said a camera
concealed by the FBI taped Laurie Recht, 35, writing a racist,
anti-Semitic death threat on her house Saturday.
   The complaint also charges that Ms. Recht reported receiving
death threats by telephone Aug. 16, although a police tracing device
failed to pick them up.
   Ms. Recht was the only speaker among 50 people at a Yonkers City
Council meeting last January who supported a court-ordered
desegregation plan, and she received extensive media attention.
   She later claimed she had received hundreds of death threats and
that swastikas and racist remarks had been written on the outside
walls of her apartment. After two incidents were reported, the FBI
installed a camera outside her apartment.
   A former legal secretary and a law student at an undisclosed
school, Ms. Recht was charged with a single count of filing a false
statement, a felony which carries up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine upon conviction.
   U.S. Magistrate Joel Tyler arraigned Ms. Recht and released her
on her own recognizance, pending a Dec. 30 court appearance.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Margaret Smith said she had no
objection to Ms. Recht being released because Ms. Recht had lived in
the area all her life, lived in the apartment for eight years and
had no previous criminal record.
   The Yonkers desegregation case stemmed from a 1985 ruling by U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand in which the city was found liable for
40 years of segregated housing and schools.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today blocked the
executions of two Sikhs condemned to death for the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the United News of
India reported.
   The decision came 14 hours before the two men were to hang.
   A panel of three Supreme Court justices granted the request for a
stay of execution filed by the son of Kehar Singh, one of the
condemned men.
   The stay will remain in effect until Tuesday to give the court
time to hear an appeal challenging the president's denial of
clemency.
   Lawyers for Satwant Singh, one of the two guards who shot Mrs.
Gandhi, and Kehar Singh, convicted of conspiracy, filed a variety of
petitions with the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court. They
sought to block the hangings scheduled for Friday morning, but those
petitions were rejected.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman last week turned down an appeal
for clemency by Kehar Singh, a Home Ministry official disclosed
Wedesday. The reason for the denial was not disclosed.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Satwant
Singh, 30, cannot be hanged while that petition was pending for
Kehar Singh, 54.
   The two men are not related, but like all members of Sikh faith
they use the name Singh, which means lion.
   Satwant Singh and another Sikh bodyguard, Beant Singh, shot Mrs.
Gandhi in the garden of her residence on Oct. 31, 1984.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed in apparent retaliation for an army raid
she ordered four months earlier to rout militants from the Golden
Temple in Amritsar, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than 1,200
people died, most of them Sikhs.
   Her murder triggered anti-Sikh riots across northern India by
members of the majority Hindu religion. More than 2,700 people died,
nearly all of them Sikhs.
   Sikh violence since then has escalated, with more than 2,300
people killed this year alone in Punjab.
   Tihar prison, where the two are being held, was under heavy guard
today, with dozens of extra security guards armed with rifles and
yardlong bamboo canes. Sentries watched from sand-bagged bunkers
outside the salmon-colored prison walls. The watchtowers atop the
walls also were sandbagged.
   In Punjab, heavily armed security forces manned checkpoints along
the roads and officials ordered schools and universities closed as a
precaution.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Officials Asked To Testify On Kwangju Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The National Assembly has asked
Washington to send two former officials to Seoul to testify on
charges the United States aided the bloody suppression of a 1980
uprising, officials said today.
   The Foreign Ministery said the request was sent to the State
Department Nov. 24 to have former U.S. Ambassador William Gleysteen
and former U.S. Army Gen. John Wickham appear before a National
Assembly committee investigating the Kwangju uprising.
   Jack Sears, the U.S. Embassy spokesman, said the United States
intends to cooperate with the investigation, but he could not
comment further until the request was evaluated in Washington.
   About 200 people were killed in the southern city of Kwangju when
South Korean soldiers put down an uprising by students and citizens.
The assembly is investigating the incident as part of a probe into
abuses under the authoritarian rule of former President Chun
Doo-hwan.
   Some opposition leaders claim U.S. involvement in the Kwangju
uprising because most South Korean forces are under the command of
the local U.S. military commander. They contend the U.S. command
gave South Korean generals permission to move units to suppress the
uprising.
   Lawmakers say they want to determine if the United States played
any role in Kwangju or condoned the action by not trying to block
deployment of South Korean forces under U.S. command.
   American officials have said that South Korean commanders moved
troops independently and U.S. commanders were not consulted. The
assembly wants to question Wickham and Gleysteen _ the top U.S.
representatives in South Korea in 1980.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing after
the Kwangju incident, went into internal exile last week after
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule. Special
parliamentary committees are investigating the Kwangju incident,
corruption and human rights abuses.
   President Roh Tae-woo and Chun were senior generals in command of
the South Korean military during the 1980 uprising. Roh took office
in February after winning December 1987 presidential elections.
   Wickham commanded U.S. forces based in South Korea under a mutual
defense pact and also was chief of the Combined Forces Command that
oversees U.S. and South Korean forces.
   The United States keeps 42,000 troops in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact against communist North Korea.
   Roh is planning a major shuffle of the government to remove
officials linked to the Chun government. He has promised to release
political prisoners as part of a plan to try and defuse the
nationwide furor over Chun.
   Opposition parties are demanding Chun appear before the National
Assembly probe. The former president has denied any personal
wrongdoing, but some relatives and aides have been convicted or
charged with corruption.
   The Cabinet decided today to accept a plan to remove the powerful
Agency for National Security Planning from any domestic political
role. The agency, once known as the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency, has been used to suppress domestic opposition in the past.
   The Cabinet said it would accept the recommendations of an
advisory group studying ways to reform the agency, except for a
proposal to subject the agency to government auditing and
parliamentary oversight.
   Opposition parties want the intelligence agency's budget made
public and parliamentary power to inquire into its activities.

<TEXT>
   Christmas furloughs for a triple murderer and
other inmates of a maximum security prison may be revoked because of
public outcry, while police sought an escapee from the same prison
in the rape of a 40-year-old woman.
   While the Patuxent Institution review board ponders the furloughs
and may decide the matter today, a warrant has been issued for James
M. Stavarakas, the prime suspect in a rape of a 40-year-old woman in
the Washington, D.C., suburb of Hyattsville. The attack bears a
startling resemblance to the crime that landed Stavarakas in prison
in 1979, authorities said. He escaped Monday from the prison in
Jessup, about 20 miles southwest of Baltimore, where he was serving
a 25-year sentence.
   The victim's general description of the attacker matched that of
Stavarakas, and she noted distinctive tattoos, said Maryland Capital
Park Police spokesman Steve Davis. In addition, the rape occurred
near the same park as Stavarakas' 1978 assault.
   Meanwhile, a Howard County Circuit Court judge on Wednesday
issued a temporary injunction blocking Patuxent officials from
granting additional furloughs to triple murderer Robert Angell for
at least 10 days.
   The order was requested by the Montgomery County Police
Association, which has filed suit to force Angell's transfer to
another prison.
   Angell, 31, was sentenced to three life terms for the murders of
two Montgomery County police officers and a teen-ager.
   Judge Cornelius Sybert said the injunction would expire at
midnight Dec. 9. A police association attorney said he would apply
then for a 10-day extension of the order.
   Lt. Gary Smith, a spokesman for the police association, said he
was pleased with Sybert's ruling.
   ``I don't think we can afford the luxury of gambling on Angell,''
he said. ``He forfeited his right to freedom when he murdered three
people.''
   The association filed the suit after reports that Angell had been
granted 11 furloughs to visit his family since April. The
corrections department put an end to the visits in the ensuing furor
and canceled Angell's planned Thanksgiving leave.
   Patuxent is the only institution in the country which has
independent powers to grant paroles and supervised furloughs, a
power some state officials want to review because of the outcry
caused by the Angell case.

<HEAD>World AIDS Day Opens With Messages From Reagan, Pope, AIDS Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, Pope John Paul II and one of the
longest living AIDS victims sent messages to the World Health
Organization today on the first World AIDS Day.
   The messages called for a stepped-up fight against AIDS and for
compassion for its victims.
   The agency organized World AIDS Day to encourage governments and
communities to talk about the disease, which affects an estimated
300,000 people worldwide. It said 140 countries planned special
television and radio programs and dances, parades and song contests.
   Entertainer Pearl Bailey told officials at WHO headquarters that
she knows a 29-year-old man with AIDS and that she wants to dedicate
her life to the fight against the disease.
   Also present was Richard Rector, a 32-year-old San Francisco man
who has had AIDS for six years. Rector said World AIDS Day should be
``the opening paragraph in a new chapter of our worldwide effort to
stop AIDS.''
   Rector, currently based in Berlin, said he has traveled to three
continents to teach people about AIDS.
   Officially, 142 countries have reported 129,385 cases of AIDS to
the World Health Organization. But the agency estimates that the
true number is more than twice that, and that 5 to 10 million people
may be infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Once a person is
infected with the virus, he or she has a 50 percent chance of
developing AIDS within 10 years.
   There is no known cure for AIDS, which attacks the body's immune
system.
   The agency has emphasized education as a primary means to fight
the spread of the infection, which can be transmitted through blood,
sexual intercourse, and from an infected mother to her unborn or
newborn child. People at high risk of infection include those with
numerous sex partners and intravenous drug users who share needles.
   Dr. James Mason, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, told the opening ceremony that the ``spread of infection
in some high risk groups in the United States is clearly declining.''
   He said this was because ``some infected and non-infected
individuals practicing risky behavior have adopted safe or less
risky lifestyles.''
   Mason noted that the first cases of AIDS were recognized in 1981,
in the United States, and that 78,985 Americans have gotten AIDS and
44,334 have died from it. But he also said: ``AIDS has stimulated an
unprecedented scientific and medical research effort that will have
long-term benefit in combating AIDS and other diseases as well.''
   Reagan called knowledge ``a critical weapon'' in fighting AIDS,
and said knowledge must also lead to individual responsibility.
   ``It is the responsibility of each individual to learn about HIV
and to treat those infected with HIV with respect and compassion.
And it is the responsibility of infected individuals not to infect
others,'' Reagan said in a message read by Miss Bailey.
   The pope's statement urged ``respect for all individuals'' and
said ``the degree of civilization of societies may be judged by how
civilization responds to the suffering of man.'' He said AIDS
victims ``meet with my affection and are the subject of my prayers.''

   Basharat Mirza, an illegal alien from Pakistan,
woke up well before dawn on the final day of an opportunity to keep
his American dream alive.
   Mirza left New York City at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday and drove about
100 miles to a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office
here.
   The 30-year-old Mirza, one of more than 1 million alien farm
workers to apply for a work permit under a nationwide amnesty
program that expired at midnight, said he chose the Lima office
because New York's INS office was crowded with other applicants.
   ``Too much rush there. Too much people there,'' Mirza said. ``Not
so many peoples here.''
   The INS initially estimated that 600,000 farm workers would pay
the $185 fee to apply under the sweeping program mandated by the
1986 immigration act. But by the deadline, 1.1 million to 1.2
million applications were taken, the agency said.
   Aaron Bodin, who heads the amnesty program for the INS, said
today that the agency did not turn away any applicants who were
waiting in line at INS offices at midnight.
   He said the agency believed many of those applying were not farm
workers, but other aliens who missed a May 4 deadline for non-farm
workers to apply for amnesty.
   ``I think it's because the standards of proof were so lenient
that many aliens, feeling increasingly desperate because of employer
sanctions (against hiring illegal aliens), took advantage of that
(farm program) to get legal status,'' Bodin said on ``This Morning''
on CBS.
   ``We really don't know how many people are truly eligible,'' he
said.
   Those aliens whose applications are rejected ``are back where
they were and the service takes no action. It's expected, however,
because of the employer sanctions provisions making it illegal for
employers to hire illegal aliens, these people will eventually be
discouraged and return home of their own volition.''
   Illegal aliens like Mirza came from as far away as Boston to the
INS office in Lima, said Jesse R. Peterson, chief legalization
officer in Philadelphia, 20 miles northeast of here.
   In the weeks before the deadline, some applicants traveled by
taxi from New York City, Peterson said. One arrived in a Mercedes
equipped with a car phone.
   ``I didn't know there was so much money in farm work,'' Peterson
joked.
   Under the first phase of the immigrant legalization program that
ended May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7
million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the United
States since Jan. 1, 1982.
   Under agricultural phase, illegal aliens had to prove they
harvested perishable crops for at least 90 days between May 1, 1985,
and May 1, 1986. Those accepted will receive temporary residency
status and eventually will be able to apply for permanent status.
   Effective today, agricultural employers now face fines up to
$10,000 per illegal alien for hiring undocumented workers.
   Many applicants provided false documentation that cost them up to
$3,000 in a desperate attempt to gain legal status, immigration
officials across the country said.
   Ten applicants were arrested Wednesday at the New Orleans INS
Office when they produced fake documents, and four others were
arrested in connection with an organization that supplied illegal
aliens with phony papers, INS officials said. In Liberal, Kan., five
people were arrested late Tuesday and early Wednesday for selling
fraudulent employment letters to illegal aliens.
   More than half the applications under the program, or about
500,000, have come from California, followed by Florida with about
10 percent and Texas with about 8 percent, officials said.
Significant numbers were filed in the Northwest, Arizona and New
York.
   At the Lima office, applicants from around the globe sat for
hours, clutching paperwork and awaiting a chance to see an INS
officer.
   Many spoke in their native tongues. One man wore a turban, others
sported cowboy or baseball hats.
   By 7:30 p.m., about 125 people had met with INS officers, with
100 more to go before midnight and beyond, Peterson said.
   ``We'll take anyone in line at midnight,'' he said.
   Mirza said he qualified for amnesty by picking grapes and
cherries in California.
   ``Since (I was a) child, I have dream to come to New York. Here,
good money,'' he said. Mirza said he came to New York in 1984 via
Greece, the Caribbean island of Bimini and an illegal boat landing
in Miami.
   Hardev Singh, a 45-year-old man from India, said through an
interpreter that he paid $600 to hide in the back of a truck from
Mexico to Los Angeles to escape political strife and unemployment.
   For Jose Villagomez, a 36-year-old mushroom worker in nearby
Kennett Square, winning residency status and thus keeping his job
was a matter of life and death for his impoverished wife and four
children back in Mexico.
   Villagomez, who speaks only Spanish, said he sends some of the
money he makes to his family.
   ``If I don't they'll die of hunger,'' he said.

   A Pakistani military attache and a
Pakistani Embassy staffer left for home today after the government
accused them of spying and ordered them expelled, news reports and
officials said.
   Brig. Z.I. Abbasi and a senior embassy clerk, Mohammad Ashraf
Khatib, were arrested Wednesday night while accepting a highly
sensitive Indian defense document, External Affairs Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao told Parliament.
   Indian officials refused to describe the nature of the document
but said the two men paid $3,500 to an Indian who handed it to them
in a New Delhi hotel. All three were arrested, but the Pakistanis
were released because of their diplomatic status.
   The United News of India news agency said Abbasi and Khatib left
New Delhi for Islamabad by plane.
   The news agency said Pakistani Ambassador Niaz A. Naik expressed
regret over the incident when he was summoned by Foreign Secretary
K.P.S. Menon.
   A spokesman at the Pakistan Embassy in New Delhi declined to
comment on the matter.
   The Press Trust of India identified the arrested Indian as a
local lawyer, Subhash Chandra Dutt. Dutt appeared before a city
magistrate today and was ordered held in police custody until Dec.
14 pending investigation, the news agency said.
   Under Indian law, people can be held for 90 days without charge.
   Rao told Parliament investigations could be hampered if any
details of the case were released.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947. Both countries have massed tens
of thousands of troops along their 970-mile border.

<HEAD>Fauntroy Denies Violating House Rules In Hiring Colleague's Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia's non-voting House
delegate says he did not violate any of the chamber's rules when he
hired a colleague's son while the son maintained a legal residence
in Chicago and waged an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois state
legislature.
   Thomas John Savage, son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., received
$21,398 while employed on Democrat Walter F. Fauntroy's staff from
September 1987 to June 1988, according to House payroll records. The
younger Savage took six weeks' leave last February and March to
campaign for the Illinois legislature.
   Savage's hiring was reported Wednesday by The Associated Press.
Fauntroy did not return a reporter's repeated phone messages last
week, Monday and Tuesday. The younger Savage also did not return
several phone calls.
   In today's editions of the Washington Post, Fauntroy said Savage
lived with his father in Washington and showed up for work at the
Capitol every day while drawing a congressional salary, with the
exception of the six weeks he took off to challenge Illinois state
Rep. Nelson Rice, a Democrat.
   Rice and other sources, however, told the AP Savage had been in
Chicago during the time he was on Fauntroy's payroll.
   Thomas Savage told the AP he was in Washington full time,
``except for a couple of weekends,'' during the period in question.
   Thomas Savage signed a statement swearing he was a resident of
the Illinois district for the required period of time when he filed
for the legislative contest, according to Illinois election
documents.
   According to an ethics guide for members of Congress prepared by
the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, House staff
employees can be paid only for services performed in Washington or
in the state or district that the member _ in this case, Fauntroy _
represents.
   Fauntroy said the younger Savage ``didn't have to come in'' all
the time.
   ``We had a desk here for him,'' the delegate told the Post.
``Sometimes he worked out of my subcommittee office and at times he
used the full committee phones.''
   According to Fauntroy, Savage was hired as a Midwest regional
coordinator to drum up grass-roots support to pressure members of
Congress to vote for the D.C. statehood bill. Savage had no direct
contact with members of Congress or their staffs, Fauntroy said, nor
did he become involved with D.C.-based statehood activists.
   Arrington Dixon, chairman of the D.C. Statehood Compact
Commission, and Josephine Butler, head of the D.C. Statehood
Commission, said Wednesday they had never heard of or met Savage.

   President-elect George Bush maintains that
``all is tranquil'' among his campaign staff despite reports of
warring opinions on whether to name former Sen. John Tower of Texas
as secretary of defense.
   ``We're not going to do everything in a great rush. We're trying
to be prudent and do the proper work required to back up
appointments at all levels,'' Bush said today.
   ``Any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to
somebody it concerns me no matter who it is. Senator Tower's a
friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while to go
forward.''
   A day earlier, Bush had told reporters ``Stay tuned,'' when asked
about Tower, who still is considered the likely choice for the top
Pentagon job.
   Asked then if there were indeed a raging battle in his staff over
the prudence of naming Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Bush laughed.
   ``No. All is tranquil. There's a thousand and one points of light
out there,'' he said in a play on an obtuse quotation he used often
in his campaign to describe the many facets of society.
   Denying any delay in filling that job, he said, ``I'm going to
stay on my schedule, make these decisions in my own time, thorough
decisions.''
   Sources close to the transition say part of the delay in the
decision on Tower results from an attempt to find a complementary
person to fill the No. 2 Pentagon spot.
   Among others mentioned for defense secretary are Paul O'Neill,
chairman of Alcoa, and Norman Augustine of Martin Marietta.
   In other transition developments:
   _A coalition of some 30 environmental groups met with Bush on
Wednesday and said he asked them for personnel recommendations for
the departments that deal with environmental matters. They gave him
a list of some 40 people.
   _Texas State Rep. Terral Smith, chairman of the state House
Natural Resources Committee, said he was heading to Washington on
Wednesday to talk to Bush about heading the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   Also being talked about for the post is former Michigan Gov.
William Milliken, whose wife, however, said her husband has not
heard from Bush's transition team. Other EPA candidates include Mike
Deland, regional administrator in Boston, and Francis Blake, former
general counsel to the regulatory relief task force and also
formerly EPA's general counsel.
   _Transition sources said former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, wife of Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, is a
contender for United Nations ambassador.
   _To head the Interior Department, former House Minority Leader
John Rhodes of Arizona is being touted by supporters. He is a
longtime friend of Bush and an intense lobbying effort on his behalf
is being led by political consultant Jay Smith, his former press
secretary. Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., is also mentioned as a serious
contender for the top job at Interior.
   Another contender is former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who
headed President Reagan's Commission on Americans Outdoors.
   _For transportation secretary, word is that Samuel K. Skinner, a
longtime Bush supporter in Illinois and now the chairman of the
Regional Transportation Authority in the Chicago area, has emerged
as the leading contender.
   Skinner met in Washington on Tuesday with members of Bush's
transition team, a source said. Newly-elected Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla., said Wednesday that he has recommended Florida's
transportation secretary, Kaye Henderson, to head Bush's
Transportation Department.
   Another possible candidate, Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., said she
really wants to become chairman of the House Republican Conference.
House GOP members will vote on that job Dec. 5.
   _Former Rep. Thomas Loeffler of Texas, one of Bush's top campaign
supporters, is a leading contender for energy secretary. Another
name recently emerging is Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the
California Energy Commission and a big booster of alternate fuels.
Evans also is a contender for this post.

   Police today sought criminal charges against
employees of Boeing Co., Japan Air Lines and the Transport Ministry
after a three-year investigation into the cause of the world's worst
single-plane crash.
   Police said the crash, in which 520 people died, was caused by
the professional negligence of 20 people, including four Boeing
employees, 12 Japan Air Lines workers and four employees of the
ministry of transport.
   The people accused of negligence were responsible for aircraft
repairs, maintenance and inspection.
   It was the first time that criminal charges arising from a plane
crash investigation have been sought against officials of the
Transport Ministry, which is responsible for aviation safety.
   Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer, said in a
statement it believed the accident did not involve a criminal act.
   ``Boeing does not believe that criminal acts were committed by
anyone and hopes that the district prosecutor's office also will
conclude that there was no criminal conduct,'' the company said.
   Gunma Prefectural Police handed results of the probe to the
Maebashi District Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether to
press charges for negligence, which is an offense under Japanese
criminal law.
   The police said they were unable to question the four Boeing
employees.
   But they said documents confiscated from Japan Air Lines provided
enough evidence to substantiate their involvement. The four
reportedly supervised a repair of the aircraft in 1978 that was
performed improperly.
   Boeing sources said that police already have names of people who
performed the repairs, but Boeing employees have rejected repeated
police requests for questioning.
   The Boeing 747 with 524 people aboard crashed into a mountain
during a flight from Tokyo to Osaka on Aug. 12, 1985, killing all
but four on board.
   The police action highlights the different legal customs
regarding air accidents and corporate criminal liability in Japan
and the United States.
   Japan is one of a few countries where criminal charges are sought
against individuals responsible for airplane accidents, said Hiroshi
Itakura, criminal law professor at Nihon University in Tokyo.
   In the United States, individuals involved in an airplane
accident are usually granted criminal immunity in exchange for
cooperating in investigations into the cause of an accident, Itakura
said.
   ``The most important thing in an accident like this is to
pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute
individuals,'' he said. ``But unlike the United States, under
Japanese criminal law corporations cannot be charged for wrongdoing.
   ``In order to disclose causes of accidents, police have to seek
criminal charges against individuals,'' he said.
   Susumu Yamachi, president of Japan Air Lines, said his company
would take the matter seriously and continue its efforts to prevent
the recurrence of such an tragic accident.
   Boeing rejected Japanese allegations that the company had
hindered the investigation, saying that it had cooperated with
Japanese authorities.
   Boeing sources said the company planned to respond to the police
inquiry, but was unlikely to allow Japanese police to question
individual employees.
   The airplane maker has disclosed that repairs it performed on the
rear bulkhead, the metal partition that protects the pressurized
cabin, of the aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 were faulty.
   The aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978
at Osaka International Airport, damaging its tail section, and
underwent major repairs, according to JAL.
   A government report issued in 1987 concluded that improper
repairs had accelerated metal fatigue, which caused the bulkhead to
burst, blowing off part of the plane's tail fin and sending the
jumbo jet out of control.
   The report accused the Boeing, JAL, and Transport Ministry
personnel of faulty repairs and inadequate inspection.
   Police said the accident could have been avoided if Boeing had
performed the repairs properly, if Japan Air Lines had checked the
repairs adequately, and if the Transport Ministry had inspected the
aircraft properly.
   A group of relatives of passengers who died in the crash have
presented signatures of 34,120 people to the Trasnport Ministry
requesting a criminal prosecution against JAL and Boeing.
   JAL said about 70 percent of compensation negotiations have been
settled. The company and Boeing have agreed to share the cost of
compensation to the victims' families and the four survivors of the
crash, according to JAL.

   A Holocaust survivor threw acid in the face of
an Israeli attorney for Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk during a
funeral today for another Demjanjuk lawyer who died in an apparent
suicide.
   The attack on attorney Yoram Sheftel injured one of his eyes,
police and a hospital spokesman said. A woman standing nearby
suffered a minor eye injury from the splashed acid, police said.
   Police said they detained the assailant, a 70-year-old survivor
of the Nazi Holocaust, immediately after the attack, which occurred
at the Sanhedria Cemetery during the funeral for Demjanjuk lawyer
Dov Eitan.
   Reporters who covered the 14-month trial of Demjanjuk said the
assailant, whose name was not released, was a frequent spectator at
the proceedings.
   The assailant was seen being dragged away, covering his face with
his hands. The Itim news agency quoted an unidentified witness as
saying the assailant told Sheftel ``Eitan died because of you.'' The
man then took a bottle out of his pocket and threw the acid.
   Sheftel was rushed to Bikur Holim Hospital, where doctors washed
the eye. His eye had ``slightly blurred vision and was shut,'' said
hospital spokesman Yehuda Kingslinger.
   Eitan, a 53-year-old former judge, died Tuesday in a fall from a
15th floor hotel window in Jerusalem. Police said the death was a
suicide.
   The death has delayed Demjanjuk's appeal of a death sentence to
Israel's Supreme Court for six months. The appeal had been scheduled
to begin Dec. 5.
   Demjanjuk, a 68-year-old retired autoworker from Cleveland, Ohio,
was sentenced in April for committing crimes against humanity and
the Jewish people as an operator of gas chambers at Treblinka Death
Camp in Poland, where 850,000 Jews perished during World War II.
   Sheftel was sent for further treatment to a special eye unit at
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, Kingslinger and officials at Hadassah
said.
   The woman injured in the attack was identified as Edna Shabtai of
Tel Aviv, said Elhanan Pels, spokesman for Shaarei Tzedek Hospital.
Israel radio said she was a writer. Pels said her eye was cleaned
and covered with a patch and that she was discharged from the
hospital.

   The deaths of four women whose bodies
were discovered near highways are related and more bodies may be
found as a search of the area continues today, a district attorney
said.
   The bodies were discovered during the last five months, with the
latest found Tuesday.
   ``I feel pretty confident they are connected somehow. There may
be more than just the four women,'' Bristol County District Attorney
Ronald A. Pina said Wednesday.
   He said the body found Tuesday ``may be No. 5, not No. 4. There
may be another person out there is my concern, if not more.''
   Three of the bodies were discovered along Interstate 195 in this
southeastern Massachusetts town. The fourth was found along a state
road in nearby Freetown. Two of the bodies were discovered in July,
the other two in November. All four women were believed to have been
nude when killed, investigators said.
   Pina said it was possible that the four deaths were connected
with the deaths of two women from Providence, R.I., whose bodies
were found last spring off highways in southeastern Massachusetts.
   None of the four more recently found bodies has been identified.
   Pina said one person may have killed the three women whose bodies
were found here, and that the person was familiar with the area.
   ``The fact that they're all in the same area would lead you to
believe that a person has done more than one killing,'' he said.
``There's no doubt that those people were all murdered and left
there.''
   State Trooper William Delaney said the bodies were left in
similar locations within 15 feet of the tree lines off the highways.
But, he said, there also were dissimilarities in the cases.
   Four women have been listed as missing from nearby New Bedford in
the last several months, but no definite link between them and the
bodies has been made.

   A man trapped in the Never Summer Mountains
for five days walked to safety three days after his snowmobiling
companion died of an apparent heart attack.
   Jim Edson, 38, stumbled onto a logging road Wednesday morning
where he was picked up by a truck driver. He and Ray Owens, 65, had
traveled to the snow-whipped mountains 50 miles northwest of Denver
last Friday on an afternoon snowmobile outing.
   Owens died Sunday, and Edson waited two more days in vain to be
rescued before walking out on his own.
   In recounting the ordeal from a hospital bed in Granby, Edson
said the men's snowmobiles became mired the day they left in a
high-country gulch 16 miles northwest of Grand Lake.
   ``When it became obvious the weather was not going to clear up
and they weren't coming after us, I decided to go out the way we
came,'' Edson said.
   Heavy winds had drifted snow over their tracks, and it took Edson
nearly five hours to walk about two miles through snow up to 2 feet
deep before he came to the logging road.
   Edson's face and hands were black from sitting by a campfire in
subzero weather. On his way out, Edson found snowmobile tracks
indicating searchers had not been more than two miles from his
campfire.
   Tony Winter, the logging truck driver, later led searchers to the
spot where he found Edson, and the searchers followed Edson's tracks
back to his camp and recovered Owens' body.
   Freezing winds sent wind-chill factors to minus 30 degrees
Fahrenheit in the area and blinding white-outs plagued would-be
rescuers during the search.
   They had called off their ground search Tuesday night, after
three days of searching.
   Edson said when they tried to free their machines Friday
afternoon, ``that was when Ray had his first heart attack. He was
feeling pretty poorly so we rested.''
   Although they had brought along trail mix, cheese, crackers and
fruit for their afternoon outing, neither man had any matches.
   Edson said they soaked a piece of cardboard in gasoline from a
snowmobile, and cranked an engine, using a sparkplug to light the
cardboard.
   ``The first night or two, when Ray was still alive, we traded
turns taking care of the fire. After he died, I'd build the fire up
and the smoke would blow in my face and choke me when it was getting
low and I'd wake up again.''
   Before he died Sunday, Owens wanted to try again to get out.
   ``He said, `Let's go real slow,' but we didn't get more than 15
feet from the camp and he decided he wasn't going,'' Edson said.
   Owens collapsed about noon Sunday and died.
   After Owens' death, Edson decided to ``stay where we were at, and
wait to be rescued.'' At one point he heard a plane overhead, but
the weather was too bad for the pilot to see them, even with a smoky
fire.
   ``I'm tired and I'm thirsty but I feel fine,'' Edson said
Wednesday night. ``I'm thankful for all the people who looked for
us, and I'm sorry to have put them to so much trouble.''

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto's selection as prime
minister triumphantly ended an 11-year effort to restore her family
name and Pakistani democracy.
   At 35, she also becomes one of the world's youngest heads of
government and the first woman prime minister to lead a Moslem
nation in modern times.
   Ms. Bhutto, who was educated at Harvard and Oxford, inherits the
political mantle of her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, who was ousted by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in a 1977 coup
and hanged two years later.
   Zia's death in an Aug. 17 plane crash made Ms. Bhutto, who had
pledged to restore democracy, the nation's only nationally
recognized political leader.
   Although a daughter of affluence, Ms. Bhutto's appeal lies mainly
among the poor masses of this country's 107 million people. They are
the strength of her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party, which
captured the most seats in the Nov. 16 National Assembly elections.
   Ms. Bhutto drew massive, adoring crowds during her campaign for
the country's first free elections since her father's death.
   Mindful of Moslem and local custom, she always is clad in
traditional clothes with a scarf draped over her head.
   The poised and articulate leader, who speaks English fluently,
shocked her Western friendsby consenting to an arranged marriage
last December with Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari.
   Ms. Bhutto, who has kept her maiden name, was groomed for
politics by her doting father as the eldest of his four children. He
sent her to study government and politics at Harvard in the United
States then at Oxford.
   It was at the British university that she tasted her first
political success when she was elected president of the prestigious
Oxford Union debating society in 1976.
   The prime minister's post is Ms. Bhutto first paying job. Her
only previous employment began in early 1977 as a non-paid trainee
in the Foreign Ministry.
   It was short-lived, however, as Zia toppled her father's
government a few months later on the pretext that elections that
year were rigged.
   Bhutto was hanged in 1979 after his conviction for helping plot
the murder of a political foe, a charge his family has denied.
   Despite years of detention and foreign exile during Zia's
authoritarian rule, Ms. Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat, kept the
party alive as Zia's disenfranchised opposition.
   Ms. Bhutto's party critics claim she has inherited her father's
domineering ego but has renounced his socialist ideals.
   Her supporters say that with Zia gone, she is Pakistan's only
nationally recognized political leader and a unifying force in the
country's volatile ethnic mosaic.
   Her party commands 105 votes in the 237-seat National Assembly,
and Ms. Bhutto says she has enough support from independents and
minor parties to command a majority.
   Ms. Bhutto espouses prosperity for the poor but has appeased the
business community with promises of a market-oriented economy, and
the military by pledging to continue Zia's staunch backing with the
United States of Moslem anti-communist rebels in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   She started her election campaign in late October, following the
Sept. 21 birth of her first child, a son named Bilawal.
   Ms. Bhutto rarely has appeared with her husband in public and has
not yet allowed public photographs of their baby.

<HEAD>Authorities Seek Clues In Blast That Killed Six Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ammonium nitrate that exploded during an
arson fire and killed six firemen had been mixed with other
compounds that made it far more explosive than usual, police say.
   A reward for information on the arsonists has reached $35,000
with an anonymous donor's offer of $25,000, and donations are
pouring in for the victims' families, city officials said.
   Firefighters from across the nation and Canada are expected at a
memorial service.
   Officials initially thought that only ammonium nitrate,
considered one of the milder and more stable explosives, had been
stored in two trailers that blew up early Tuesday at a highway
construction site.
   But the ammonium nitrate had been mixed with diesel fuel, pink
dye and powdered aluminum to form ``Maynes mix,'' a blasting agent
usually detonated by a small amount of dynamite, police said.
   The mixture explains why the blasts were powerful enough to kill
the firefighters, demolish two firetrucks and create a shock wave
that broke windows up to 10 miles away and was heard up to 40 miles
away.
   ``All it requires is a heat source'' to detonate, said police
Sgt. Gregory Mills.
   Mills said there were no significant developments Wednesday in
the arson investigation.
   Officials announced a $35,000 reward for information on suspects
in the fire. Sandy Berkley, wife of Mayor Richard Berkley who is on
a trade mission in the Far East, said a donor who wishes to remain
anonymous had given $25,000 toward the reward fund. An additional
$5,000 came from the Heavy Equipment Construction Workers and $5,000
from the Arson Hotline.
   Donations also have been pouring into Union Bank in Kansas City,
where a fund has been established to help the victims' families,
bank spokesman Carl Eichenberger said.
   ``Everyone has been so extremely helpful in trying to donate. All
they're concerned about is the families,'' Eichenberger said. He
said the total amount of money donated was not available Wednesday.
   A public memorial service for the six firefighters is scheduled
Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium and firefighters from almost every
state, including New York, California, Texas and Washington, have
called to ask about the ceremony. Even a fire department in Canada
said firefighters plan to attend, said Harold M. Knabe, a Fire
Department spokesman.
   The six firefighters had been warned by a dispatcher there could
be explosives at the scene of a fire that police believe was started
by an arsonist, according to transcripts of conversations with
dispatchers. But fire officials said the six apparently saw no signs
at the site indicating that explosives were stored in the trailers.
   The City Council on Wednesday discussed drafting tougher laws
regarding the regulation of explosives.
   The president of the International Association of Fire Fighters,
Alfred K. Whitehead, called for a congressional investigation into
the construction site explosion and what he called ``a tragic
addition to the growing list of hazardous material accidents.''

   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today said 28
people have been killed in two weeks ofethnic violence in the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Kremlin leaders issued an
urgent appeal for calm.
   Official reports said thousands of people were fleeing the unrest.
   ``We are losing our people,'' Interior Ministry spokesman B.
Mikhailov was quoted as saying in Pravda.
   The situation in the southern region remained tense, with mass
meetings in many towns in Azerbaijan despite the presence of Soviet
troops, tanks and a strict curfew, Azerbaijan Interior Minister A.
Mamedov said.
   Authorities have confiscated homemade pistols, sawed-off rifles
and explosives from young people in Armenia and Azerbaijan,
Mikhailov said.
   He said said the death toll includes Armenians, Azerbaijanis, a
Russian, a Byelorussian and a Ukrainian.
   In Moscow, at the end of a three-day conference of the Supreme
Soviet, the Kremlin leadership announced plans for the parliament's
Presidium, the highest state executive body, to hold a meeting of
party, state and social organizations with national deputies from
Armenia, Azerbaijan and the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   ``The Supreme Soviet appeals to workers of Armenia and Azerbaijan
to display wisdom and restraint,'' said a directive signed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that called for the meeting.
   Azerbaijan and Armenia, two southern Soviet republics, are locked
in a bitter dispute for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The
area is part of Azerbaijan, but its predominantly Armenian
population has been agitating since February for annexation by
Armenia.
   Both Azerbaijan and the Kremlin have rejected annexation.
   Arkady Volsky, the Kremlin's special representative in Armenia
and Azerbaijan, told the Supreme Soviet just before it adjourned
that in Azerbaijan, ``nothing was done to eliminate the tension
right away.''
   ``The situation is boiling in both republics,'' Volsky said. ``We
are appealing to the peoples of Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is time
to stop.''
   In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Pravda correspondents
reported activists wearing red headbands gathered around bonfires on
the streets at night, engaged in heated discussion of the violence.
   Many cities in the region are under military rule and strict
curfews as a result of the unrest between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Official media in Baku and in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, said
thousands of refugees were streaming across the border to their
respective ethnic homelands.
   The official Armenian news agency Armenpress said the latest
round of killings began Nov. 22 and included a Moslem mullah.
   Leon Azruyan, the night editor in charge of Armenpress, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that the Azerbaijani mullah fired into
a meeting of Armenians in the city of Kalinino in northern Armenia
last week, ``but they threw stones at him. One hit him in the head
and killed him.''
   He said other deaths occurred in the cities of Kirovakan,
Krasnoselsk and Spitak in northern Armenia but that there was no
detailed information on how many died in each city or the
circumstances.
   Earlier, four soldiers were killed protecting Armenian residents
of the Azerbaijani city of Kirovabad, and soldiers shot and killed
three civilians there for violating curfew. Violence also was
reported in Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave between Armenia and
the Iranian border.
   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh began in February. Mass
demonstrations broke out, and at the end of February ethnic rioting
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait killed at least 32 people.
   The latest unrest began in mid-November.
   Azerbaijanis accused Armenia of sending settlers into
Nagorno-Karabakh to pad the Armenian majority there, of forcing
Azerbaijanis out of work, and refusing them food and medical
supplies.
   Official Yerevan radio, in a report monitored in London by the
British Broadcasting Corp., said more than 20,000 ethnic Armenian
refugees from Azerbaijan had arrived since Nov. 22. It said many
arrived in Armenia without clothing, money, or documents, and in
need of medical treatment. It said empty houses had been
requisitioned to shelter them.

   The Supreme Soviet voted overwhelmingly today to
adopt Mikhail S. Gorbachev's overhaul of the political structure,
but a handful of ``no'' votes and abstentions showed the reforms
remain controversial.
   Five deputies in the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, voted against
the package of constitutional amendments, which give more power to
President Gorbachev and provide for indirect election of the
president and lawmakers.
   Gorbachev, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party,
told the deputies that a storm of controversy over the reforms _
including 250,000 letters to the Kremlin _ could have been reduced,
and he took the blame.
   ``We did not care about explaining the essence, the meaning'' of
the changes, Gorbachev said. ``The center was just following the old
practice, thinking, well, they would get used to it.''
   ``All of us are now learning our lessons. All of us are in a
school of democracy, and we should be good pupils in that school,''
Gorbachev said.
   In the Soviet of Nationalities, half of the bicameral Supreme
Soviet parliament, the vote was 657 in favor, 3 against and 26
abstentions on amending the constitution to incorporate Gorbachev's
proposals.
   The Soviet of Unions voted 687 in favor, 2 against with one
abstention to approve the same measures. A companion package
providing for multiple-candidate elections was adopted unanimously
by both houses.
   At least three of the negative votes came from Estonians, whose
tiny Baltic republic has declared its sovereignty from Moscow.
   The reforms create a strong presidency in place of the largely
ceremonial role now accorded the head of state. They also establish
a new Congress of People's Deputies to elect the president and a new
Supreme Soviet, which will meet for eight months a year.
   Elections for the new congress were set for March 26, and
Gorbachev said today's session was the last meeting of the current
Supreme Soviet. He said no emergency sessions would be called before
the elections.
   The package was being changed almost up until the final vote to
incorporate objections from lawmakers and the public.
   Many of those who objected to various drafts said it gave too
much power to one person. The most vociferous and widespread
complaints came from independent-minded republics, including
Estonia, which claimed the reforms would prevent them from governing
their own affairs.
   The Supreme Soviet rejected Estonia's last-ditch request to be
allowed to keep a single parliament in the republic, without
creating a new congress.
   The reform provides for the same double-parliament structure in
each of the republics as at the national level.
   The body also voted down an amendment that would effectively have
given the republics veto power in the parliament. The revision was
offered by Jemma Sculme, a delegate from Latvia, another Baltic
republic.
   The final version of the package was not immediately published in
the official media, so it wasn't known how many concessions were
made before the vote.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged the original version was flawed. After
the vote, he gave a short speech praising the debate during the
three-day special parliamentary session and the work of the deputies
who helped make alterations.
   Until recently, the national legislature merely approved actions
already taken by the leadership, without debate or dissent.
   This time, the Supreme Soviet heard 37 of its members criticize
and propose changes in the plan submitted by Gorbachev.
   The 1,500-member body recommended dozens of changes over two days
of debate. On Wednesday, it asked the Presidium _ the nation's
highest executive body _ and two committees to decide which
suggestions to include in the final version.
   The official Tass news agency said the committees met Wednesday
night, but it did not report details.
   Gorbachev's plan includes more than 100 pieces of legislation.
   Several deputies opposed the national Congress idea because of
two main elements _ indirect election of the Supreme Soviet and the
proposal that one-third of the Congress members be chosen by social
and political organizations, such as the Communist Party and trade
unions.
   One of the main critics of the plan was the president of Estonia,
Arnold Ruutel. Estonian leaders declared Nov. 16 their republic is
sovereign in all but defense and foreign affairs and has the right
to veto Soviet laws.
   Ruutel told deputies Wednesday that no political system suits all
parts of this vast nation, ``so we have developed our own.''
   Estonia came under repeated attack by delegates for its actions
last month. The Presidium, which Gorbachev heads, nullified
Estonia's declaration of sovereignty on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of
Pakistan's last freely elected leader, was named prime minister
today and became the first woman to lead a Moslem nation in modern
times.
   The appointment, combined with Wednesday's seating of an elected
National Assembly and four provincial assemblies, returned Pakistan
to democracy after the 11-year rule of Gen. Mohammed Zia and a
caretaker government.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said in a televised address that Ms.
Bhutto, 35, had ``the best qualities of leadership and foresight as
a statesman.''
   He said he was convinced her Pakistan People's Party could
command a majority in the National Assembly following the country's
first free elections in more than a decade.
   Ishaq Khan also announced the end of a state of emergency
declared in August after Zia's death in a plane crash. He did that,
he said, ``so the new prime minister can take up her responsibility
in an environment of complete democracy.''
   He also said he had received the resignations of the post-Zia
caretaker government, effective on Friday when Ms. Bhutto will take
the oath of office.
   ``Ms. Benazir Bhutto is a sound, educated, civilized, cultured
and talented woman,'' said the president, speaking in Pakistan's
official Urdu language.
   ``She has the best qualities of leadership and foresight of a
statesman. She has the country's love in her heart.''
   Ishaq Khan, 73, congratulated her as ``the choice of the people.''
   Ms. Bhutto will lead a nation dominated by the laws of Islam,
which do not allowed women to appear in public without a veil
covering their faces.
   Islamic scholars disagree on whether the Moslem holy book, the
Koran, prohibits women from engaging in public life. But Ishaq Khan
has said Pakistan's Constitution says a woman can become head of
state.
   Ms. Bhutto's party today picked up 12 more seats in the National
Assembly, the lower house of parliament, after Wednesday's voting on
20 seats reserved exclusively for women.
   It meant her Pakistan People's Party commanded 105 votes in the
237-seat legislature. She said she had enough support from
independents and minor parties to command a majority over the
conservative eight-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, which rallied
Zia loyalists.
   It was a triumph for the Bhutto forces who had been in political
exile since Gen. Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless 1977 coup. Bhutto was executed
in 1979 after he was convicted of conspiring to kill a political
rival.
   Ms. Bhutto has pledged to help restore democracy to Pakistan.
Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others were killed in a
Aug. 17 plane crash. An investigation found sabotage as a probable
cause for the crash, but no arrests have been made and the probe is
continuing.

   The liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis
and five military astronauts on a secret spy satellite mission was
postponed today for 24 hours by fierce winds eight miles above the
launch site.
   ``We were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed
due to winds aloft,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   Weather officials reported the wind velocity 41,000 feet up was
104 mph, a condition that could seriously damage the wings of a
shuttle passing through and cause the vehicle to break up.
   Sieck said launch officials had decided to try again on Friday
morning, but that a final decision on whether to proceed would be
made about 9:30 p.m. tonight before the shuttle is fueled.
   ``We're going to take a hard look at the weather again,'' he
said. ``If it is clearly a no-go tomorrow, we don't want to exercise
the launch team, the crew and the systems.''
   The time for a launch Friday would be sometime between 6:32 and
9:32 a.m. EST, the same as for today. The exact moment remained a
secret because the mission is classified, but sources said the
target was about 7 a.m.
   Col. John Madura, an Air Force meteorologist, said the storm
front that brought winds, rain and clouds to the area today would be
offshore in the Atlantic on Friday. But in its wake, he said, there
could be strong ground winds that could affect a launch.
   Madura said that at 8:55 a.m., when the scrub announcement was
made, the low-level clouds, rain and winds had moved away, but the
high altitude winds remained above limits.
   Madura said that if Friday's weather was unacceptable, the
outlook for Saturday was not too good, with continued strong ground
winds. ``Sunday appears to be the best of the three days,'' he said.
   The countdown, blacked out publicly for security reasons, stood
at nine minutes when the scrub was called, sources reported. It had
been held there for more than an hour while officials waited in vain
for a significant break in the weather.
   The astronauts, who had boarded the spacecraft shortly after 4
a.m. in their bulky escape suits, returned to crew quarters seven
miles from the launch pad.
   ``They took it in stride,'' Sieck said of their reaction to the
scrub. ``We had talked about this threat ever since we picked up the
count, so it came as no surprise.''
   The postponement was nothing new for the crew commander, Navy
Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson. As commander of Columbia on the 24th
mission, he had experienced a recordd seven postponements and had to
board the ship six times before finally taking off.
   Technicians promptly began emptying the huge external fuel tank
of the half-million gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen
that had been pumped aboard overnight. The fuel will be reused for
the next attempt at launching.
   The forecast for this morning had been ominous for days, and NASA
knew it was gambling when it decided to load the fuel tank. the
space agency has estimated the costs of a last-minute scrub at about
$250,000.
   The fickle weather at the Florida launch site has been a
persistent problem, forcing numerous delays and postponements of
previous shuttle launches. Weather criteria for launch have been
tightened since the Challenger explosion of January 1986.
   There also was a report of unacceptable weather at the runway
across the Atlantic where the shuttle might have to land if one or
two engines failed early into the flight.
   Favorable weather is especially critical in case Atlantis
develops trouble immediately after liftoff and has to make an
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Safety
considerations call for clouds no lower than 8,000 feet above the
runway, seven miles visibility and surface winds less than 14 mph.
   Rain on liftoff or landing could damage the ship's thermal
protection tiles, and high winds aloft could damage the craft
structurally, especially its wings.
   The go-ahead for fueling came after NASA reported that repairmen
using glue had succeeded in fastening a loose panel back onto
Atlantis' nose.
   Atlantis' flight is the second by a shuttle since missions
resumed after the 1986 Challenger accident. It is the third mission
for Atlantis, the newest ship in the shuttle fleet. There have been
two previous secret Air Force flights _ both in 1985.
   Though neither NASA nor the Air Force will discuss the cargo,
sources said the shuttle was to launch a $500 million spy satellite
called Lacrosse. The sources said the satellite carries a powerful
new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of
military targets in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Lacrosse is
expected to act as the radar ``eye in the sky'' for the new B-2
stealth bomber.
   The quick-fix repair job Wednesday was in response to a problem
with bolts on a cover of a service panel in the orbiter's nose. The
panel is used to fill the fuel tanks of the shuttle's forward
steering rockets.
   When the launch pad crew attempted to replace the cover to the
panel, two of 10 bolts failed. The workers then used glue, heated by
lamps, to secure the edges of the 1{-by-2-foot panel cover.
   As with the previous military flights, Pentagon officials said
the prelaunch secrecy was necessary to foil surveillance efforts by
Soviet satellites and by spy ships off the Florida coast.
   Once Atlantis is in orbit, all space-to-ground communication will
be encoded and there will be only the barest of public
announcements, in contrast with the launch-to-liftoff eavesdropping
that is usual on shuttle missions.
   Gibson's crew members are Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the
pilot, and mission specialists Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col.
Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
Gardner and Shepherd have never flown in space before.
   The flight is expected to last three or four days with a landing
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   Black residents today announced
a consumer boycott of white-owned stores in Boksburg, one of several
towns where right-wing officials have reimposed strict apartheid
measures.
   ``The (Conservative Party) wants to keep its town white. We are
going to grant them their Christmas wish,'' said Buchanan Jantjes,
who heads the management committee in Boksburg's mixed-race township
of Reiger Park. Jantjes also told reporters blacks and people of
mixed-race would stage a sit-in Friday at Boksburg Lake, which
recently was reserved for whites.
   Four South African sporting bodies announced sanctions against
towns attempting to increase race segregation.
   Governing organizations for cricket, golf, cycling and men's
field hockey in separate statements said they have canceled
competitions or will refuse to give funds to towns, schools and
clubs that encourage discrimination.
   Also today, a handcuffed black teen-ager plunged to his death
from the seventh floor of an apartment building while in the custody
of police investigators who alleged he was a guerrilla, the police
commissioner said.
   The Conservative Party, which captured dozens of town councils in
Oct. 26 elections, has touched off a storm of controversy with its
efforts to ban blacks from public facilities integrated in recent
years.
   This week three councils in towns outside Johannesburg _
Boksburg, Brakpan and Carletonville _ have voted to resegregate
parks, town halls and swimming pools and to bar blacks from owning
businesses in town. Other communities announced similar plans.
   The Conservatives view limited race reforms by President P.W.
Botha's National Party as capitulation to the nation's 26-million
black majority.
   Jantjes predicted the boycott ``will be disastrous for
Boksburg,'' whose white businessmen depend heavily on the town's
more than 150,000 blacks and people of mixed-race. Boksburg has
87,000 whites.
   Mayor Beyers de Klerk vowed not to soften his stance.
   ``I am here to fight to survive and I expect all the thunderbolts
in hell to rain down on me,'' he said.
   Meanwhile Botha restated his party policy of segregated
neighborhoods. ``The government maintains its position, namely the
maintenance of own communities for every population group,'' he said
Wednesday night.
   Minister of Constitutional Development Chris Heunis warned town
councils not to ``sabotage'' national policy.
   ``Such ill-considered action by irresponsible people can in one
day destroy attitudes and relationships that have been built up
through years of hard work,'' Heunis said.
   He gave no indication the government planned to change laws
allowing local authorities to discriminate.
   Newspapers accused the government of hypocrisy, noting National
Party-controlled cities maintain segregated facilities ranging from
buses to beaches.
   Regarding the death of the black suspect, Gen. Hennie de Witt
said Amos Khoza, 18, ``managed to throw himself over a wall and
consequently fell to his death.'' De Witt said a high-ranking
officer would investigate the incident.
   De Witt's statement said Khoza was arrested today in Klerksdorp,
a town west of Johannesburg, because police believed he had
``terrorist weapons.''
   Khoza was brought to central Johannesburg to identify an
apartment where he purportedly made contact with a member of the
African National Congress guerrilla movement, de Witt said. De Witt
said Khoza was recruited by the outlawed ANC and was to have
received guerrilla training abroad.
   There have been numerous incidents in recent years where suspects
have died while in the company of police investigators. Police say
some were shot and killed while trying to escape and others leaped
to their deaths from windows.
   Also today, police reported five black men were stabbed to death
in separate attacks in strife-torn townships near southeastern
Pietermaritzburg city. Four men were arrested in the attacks.

<HEAD>Former Police Chief Charged With Nepotism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A misdemeanor charge of nepotism is the only
charge that came out of an investigation of the town's former police
chief, a black man who charged racial bias after he was fired amid
allegations of misconduct.
   The nepotism charge was filed against former chief Charles
Crawford, 45, who had been accused of sexually harassing female
employees.
   Crawford is accused of appointing a sister-in-law as a temporary
police department employee Sept. 7. He was fired Oct. 6, and his
sister-in-law no longer works in the department.
   District Attorney Larry Stuart said Tuesday that state law
prohibits an elected official from appointing or hiring any person
related to him by marriage or blood within the third degree. The
charge carries a fine of between $100 and $1,000 and forfeiture of
office.
   Allegations against Crawford had included sexual involvement with
dispatchers and juveniles, sexual harassment of other female
employees, preferential treatment for some residents and harsh
handling of others. One former dispatcher has filed a paternity suit
against him.
   Crawford said city officials who opposed having a black chief
conspired to oust him, using allegations that he had affairs with
white police dispatchers to raise the ire of the all-white City
Council. The town of 3,000 people has about 150 blacks.
   Stuart issued a statement saying the nearly two-month
investigation by his office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation ``failed to produce substantiated evidence, or victims
who desired to pursue criminal charges.''
   He said matters alleged to have occurred more than three years
ago were not investigated because the statute of limitations had

   Stuart said he expected no other charges against Crawford.
   Crawford and the city have been named in a $4.4 million civil

sexually harassed employees and strong-armed residents to collect

   Strong winds and cloudy skies hampered
helicopter search and rescue operations today in battered coastal
regions and tiny sand bars where more than 500 people were reported
dead after a cyclone.
   The cyclone lashed the Bay of Bengal coast Tuesday night,
churning up 15-foot-high waves that submerged low-lying islands and
pounding the mainland with winds up to 102 mph.
   Dhaka newspapers said at least 500 people died and more than
1,000 were missing in Bangladesh. In neighboring India, police
sources said about 80 people were killed in West Bengal state.
   Cyclones and floods traditionally have ravaged the low-lying
region. In 1970, 300,000 people died in a cyclone. In 1985, the
death toll reached 10,000 when another cyclone pelted the region.
   Official figures in India and Pakistan on the latest storm were
much lower, reflecting bureaucratic delays and the nearly impossible
task of obtaining information from areas where communications are
poor even in good weather.
   The human toll and the difficulty in accurately assessing it were
augmented by the settlement of thousands of peasants and fishermen
on newly emerging islands off the Bangladesh coast.
   Hundreds of these islands, most of them narrow sand bars that are
partially submerged each day even by normal tides, have been created
by silt and sediment dumped into the Bay of Bengal from the rivers
that originate in the Himalayas of India and Nepal.
   In Dhaka, official sources said the death toll in Bangladesh was
350.
   In Calcutta, capital of West Bengal state, a senior police
officer insisted he had only five confirmed death reports for the
entire state, even though other Indian officials said Wednesday
night that 29 people were known to have perished in the storm.
   All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   United News of India put Bangladesh's death toll at 870, saying
this included 500 fishermen caught in the storm.
   The cyclone struck while Bangladesh was still trying to recover
from last summer's floods that killed about 1,500 people and
destroyed the homes of more than one-fifth of the population of 110
million.
   Two Dhaka newspapers _ the government-owned Bangladesh Times and
the independent Ittefaq _ said about 500 people died from
electrocution, drowning, or when houses collapsed on them. The
newspapers said a few thousand were injured.
   Ittefaq said at least 412 people were killed in the southwestern
districts of coastal Khulna and inland Jessore, with most of the
other deaths reported in a swath of districts along the coast.
   Up to 900 fishermen were missing at Dublar Char, a half-mile-wide
strip of land in the bay off the Sunderban forest, Ittefaq said. The
Bengali-language newspaper said about 275 more fishermen were
missing off the island of Kutubdia.
   In the Indian area adjacent to the Sunderban forest, the storm
razed hundreds of mud huts used by fishermen.
   ``Our home kept rattling and shaking,'' said Ashim Kumar Dey in
India's Diamond Harbor area. Dey said three of his cows died when
his house collapsed.
   The cyclone also took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and
palm-thatch dwellings used by Bangladeshi fishermen and rice
farmers. Some official sources estimated that tens of thousands, and
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people, were left homeless in
Bangladesh.
   Heavy winds and cloudy skies grounded some military helicopters
that were to be used for relief operations, but official sources
said some were able to start ferrying relief materials.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad canceled an inspection tour of
the coast today because of the poor weather.

   Chelsea school officials are close to accepting
Boston University's proposal to manage their beleaguered public
schools, but opponents vow to continue their legal challenges.
   ``I think it presents a new hope for the community,'' John
Zimini, president of the Chelsea Board of Aldermen, said Wednesday,
the day after school committee officials tentatively backed the plan
by a 5-2 vote.
   Officials said they expect to have a contract within the next few
weeks.
   The unprecedented offer has been under negotiation for three
years. Chelsea's 3,400-student district has the highest dropout rate
in the state and has not built a school since 1923.
   But union lawyers say public officials are willing to cede too
much power to the university and they will continue their legal
challenge to the plan despite failing to get an injunction to stop
Tuesday's vote.
   ``It's not over yet,'' said Paul Devlin, president of the
Massachusetts Federation of Teachers.
   The unions are challenging the plan on the grounds it is against
state law to put a tax-funded institution under private management.
   University officials maintain they will not be taking the public
schools private but will simply be managers who have to answer to
the School Committee.
   ``I think that it takes an awful lot of courage on the part of
the city to say, `Hey, look we've tried our best, the money's just
not there,''' Zimini said. ``Unfortunately in our society any kind
of change is always a fear factor.''
   The working-class town on Boston Harbor, with its influx of
Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrants, has been strained
financially by a small tax base, elderly population and a 1980 state
tax-limiting law.
   Zimini said he cannot predict how aldermen will vote but believes
the contract will be approved. The pact also requires enabling
legislation by state lawmakers.
   The university proposes to revamp the curricula, build new
schools, provide mothers and pregnant teen-agers with counseling on
nutrition and child-rearing, tailor learning plans to individual
students and set up after-school programs.

   The left-of-center Labor Party and the
right-wing Likud bloc deadlocked today in rival efforts to form a
coalition government after one of four key religious parties
defected from Likud to Labor.
   The move by the five-member, ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party
gave Labor the support of 60 lawmakers in the 120-member Knesset _
not enough to form a government but enough to block Likud, which has
the backing of 58 legislators.
   The balance of power now is in the hands of the undecided Torah
Flag Party, which has two seats. Party leader Rabbi Avraham Ravitz
said he preferred a broad-based government but didn't ``rule out the
possibility that Labor will form the government.''
   It is the latest turnaround in complicated negotiations since
Nov. 1 elections in which Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud won
40 seats while Labor, led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, won 39.
   At the city's Wailing Wall today, ultra-Orthodox Jews shouted
angrily as 100 feminists carried a Torah and held a 30-minute
all-woman prayer session. They defied Orthodox rules forbidding
women from carrying or reading the book of Jewish literature.
   Men pounded on the fence traditionally dividing them from the
women, some of whom wore prayer shawls and skullcaps traditionally
worn by males.
   ``I protest. In the name of God I protest,'' shouted a
grey-bearded Jews as the women prayed and sang. The prayer session
marked the end of the First International Jewish Feminist Conference
in Jerusalem, attended by women from more than 20 countries. ``They
should realize that prayer isn't only for men,'' said Blu Greenberg
of New York.
   The feminists represented Reform or Conservative branches of
Judaism which do not adhere to some Orthodox rules excluding women
from Jewish rituals.
   On Israel radio today, Shamir said he still is optimistic of
meeting President Chaim Herzog's request that he form a government.
   Earlier this week, Shamir appeared to have firm support of 65
legislators.
   But religious parties started bolting when he asked Labor to join
the government, fearing Likud would break promises to them to
accommodate Labor.
   Political alignments were shaken again when Labor's Executive
Bureau, in an apparent rebellion against its party leadership, voted
Wednesday not to join a Likud-led government.
   The Labor leader said he would try to form a narrow government.
   ``It's difficult when five members can topple the government
whenever they want,'' Peres said in an Israel television interview.
   His chances improved after Agudat Israel agreed to join a Labor
government.
   Agudat Israel leader Rabbi Menachem Porusch said his party was
angered by Likud's advances toward Labor.
   ``Likud was supposed to reach an agreement with us,'' Porusch
said on Israel radio. ``But instead, the Likud ... wanted to reach
an agreement with Labor.''
   He reiterated that his party would join only a coalition
promising to pass legislation giving Orthodox rabbis sole authority
over conversions to Judaism.
   Porusch acknowledged Labor leaders promised only to take the
matter before the party's Central Committee.
   The so-called ``Who is a Jew'' legislation has enraged American
Jews, most of whom belong to Conservative and Reform branches of
Judaism that would be excluded from getting automatic Israeli
citizenship.

<TEXT>
   A man has been acquitted of a charge of
manufacturing and distributing a so-called designer drug known as
``ecstasy'' because the drug's lengthy scientific name was
misspelled in state law.
   David Burling, 19, of Kenesaw, was charged with making and
selling methylenedioxymethamphetamine, more commonly known as MDMA
or ``ecstasy.''
   Designer drugs are formulated to have the effect of an illegal
drug without being specifically outlawed.
   Adams County District Judge Bernard Sprague ruled Tuesday that
Burling did not violate the law since he did not possess the drug
named in the state statute.
   Adams County Attorney James Hatheway argued that the discrepency
was a typographical error and that the intent of the law was to make
MDMA illegal.
   Burling's attorney, Jim Smith of Hastings, said the misspelling
was significant but other factors contributed to Burling's
acquittal. He said Hatheway failed to prove the drug Burling
possessed was illegal.
   Hatheway said he was disappointed in the verdict but does not
plan to appeal. He said he discovered the spelling error in June and
notified the state Legislature.

   Top Soviet chess player Elena Akhmilovskaya and
her new husband, John Donaldson, captain of the U.S. men's chess
team, said today they hope the Soviets will allow Akhmilovskaya's
daughter to join them soon in the United States.
   Speaking on ``CBS This Morning,'' Akhmilovskaya, who received an
immigrant visa Tuesday, said that she hoped the spirit of glasnost,
or openness, would carry over and that the Soviet authorities ``let
her join me very, very soon.''
   The couple secretly wed Friday during the Chess Olympiad in
Greece. Akhmilovskaya's 7-year-old daughter lives in Soviet Georgia.
   Donaldson said he met Akhmilovskaya during a qualification
tournament for the women's world championship in Cuba in 1985.
Donaldson was trainer for the U.S. women's team and Akhmilovskaya
was playing for the Soviets.
   Donaldson said they did not necessarily plan to elope in Greece,
but that ``I think it was something in the back of each of our minds.
   ``We hadn't seen each other since 1986 in Dubai, when they had
the previous chess tournament in the (United Arab) emirates. So we
knew that there was a good chance that it might be our only
opportunity,'' the 31-year-old Donaldson said.
   He said they wrote to each other during their separation but ``we
had to be a little circumspect because it wasn't good to draw
attention to it (the relationship).''
   Akhmilovskaya, who speaks broken English, said she will ``try to
speak with Mr. Gorbachev'' when he visits New York next Tuesday for
a meeting with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Donaldson said he hopes authorities will be sympathetic to their
plight to get his wife and her daughter reunited.
   ``I think that they understand that sometimes these things
happen,'' Donaldson said.
   The couple plans to stay in the New York area until Gorbachev's
visit. They plan to settle eventualy in Seattle, Donaldson's home,
where they will work for Biweekly Chess magazine.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Cut Off Grants to Two Harvard Scientists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have cut off funds to two Harvard
University-affiliated scientists involved in controversial research
at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.
   National Institutes of Health officials told The Boston Globe the
decision to cut off the funds did not indicate wrongdoing by the
scientists. But they said investigators were in Boston on Wednesday
inspecting hospital records to see if patients were hurt or grant
money was misused.
   Officials of the NIH terminated the last two years of funds for a
five-year, $850,000 grant to Sheffer C.G. Tseng, a former Harvard
scientist now at the University of Miami.
   The two scientists have been the focus of growing attention since
October, when Tseng was reported to have tested an experimental eye
drug on hundreds of Massachusetts Eye and Ear patients between 1984
and 1986 while helping to organize, and profiting from, a company
that made the drug, which has proven largely ineffective.
   NIH officials also suspended consideration of a $191,000 grant
application submitted by Tseng's Harvard supervisor, associate
professor Kenneth R. Kenyon, and demanded Kenyon be replaced as
director of an NIH-funded fellowship program at the Eye Research
Institute, a private organization associated with the eye and ear
hospital.

   A top buyout firm won the tumultuous war for RJR
Nabisco with the biggest takeover on record, a $24.53 billion offer
that derailed a rival bid by Nabisco executives who triggered the
bidding frenzy.
   RJR Nabisco Inc. directors approved the $109-a-share offer by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Inc. late Wednesday, capping a day of
frantic, confusing maneuvering in the auction of the
cigarette-and-food giant.
   A member of the competing investment group led by RJR chief
executive officer F. Ross Johnson said their last-minute offer _
$25.42 billion or $112 per share _ had been higher, but suggested
the group had been cheated by an unfair bidding process.
   The value of Kohlberg's offer for America's 19th largest
industrial company was nearly double the old takeover record, $13.4
billion for Gulf Corp. in 1984.
   Although the Johnson group's offer appeared to be higher, RJR
said its board of directors concluded Kohlberg's offer was
substantially equal. Kohlberg's offer per share broke down to $81 in
cash, $18 in stock and additional securities worth $10, RJR said.
   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of all
directors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the best
interest of the company and its shareholders,'' the company said.
RJR did not say exactly why Kohlberg's offer prevailed.
   The breakdown of the Johnson group's bid was not disclosed, but
Shearson Lehman Hutton, the Wall Street firm that was one of its key
financial partners, said, ``From what we know, our bid was the
best.''
   ``We are mystified about the process and the standards that the
board used to reach its decision,'' it said in a statement. ``We are
going to continue to keep our options open. We believe the RJR
shareholders will have a lot of questions as well.''
   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed
money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was happy with
the outcome.
   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so
that the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and the
communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return
to normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's two
principals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in a statement.
   However, the deal raised the prospect that some businesses in one
of America's biggest consumer product companies might be sold to
help Kohlberg pay for its prize.
   Kohlberg gave no indication which of RJR's worldwide operations
might be discarded. There was speculation that candidates could
include some or all of RJR's food businesses. RJR's tobacco business
roots still account for about 40 percent of its sales.
   Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer products
companies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. Its brands
include such well-known products as Camel cigarettes, Shredded Wheat
and Life Savers.
   The deal's size and complexity have raised major questions about
whether the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and debt-financed
restructurings has gone too far in transforming much of corporate
America.
   The deal also signaled a spectacular defeat for Johnson, whose
group began the struggle to take the company private with a
$75-a-share offer on Oct. 20 that was raised five times.
   ``I am proud that we put the best bid on the table the first time
and this time,'' Johnson said in a statement following Kohlberg's
victory.
   It was not clear whether the scrappy, daring executive would try
to reopen the war. His tenure as head of RJR was even less certain.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that Kohlberg would
install RJR's former chairman and chief executive officer, J. Paul
Sticht, in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition.
The newspaper said Kohlberg would move the company's corporate
headquarters back to Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Earlier Wednesday, Johnson's group tried to raise its bid after a
company-decreed deadline for all offers expired. The move
temporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billion Kohlberg Kravis
offer the RJR board was about to approve.
   In heavy New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, RJR stock
shot up $2.25 to $93 a share on the possibility the auction would be
prolonged. In early trading today, RJR was off 75 cents to $92.25 a
share.
   Sources familiar with the bidding who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the offer of a third contender, First Boston Corp.
was rejected as too tentative, although the bidder valued it as high
as $115 a share or $25.87 billion.
   When the battle began in October, RJR stock was trading at less
than $56 a share. For RJR shareholders who held on for the last five
wild weeks, their pretax gain totals nearly 95 percent.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An impostor wearing a lab coat, surgical gloves and
stethoscope wandered through hospital halls for weeks, sat in on
medical school classes and was arrested after asking to examine a
patient, police say.
   Jonathan Ashley Battle, 23, who has no medical degree, spent at
least three weeks at Jackson Memorial Hospital and had acquired 21
keys to doctors offices, Metro-Dade police say.
   ``They were keys even security didn't have access to,'' said
Robert NeeDelman, an officer assigned to the hospital. ``This guy is
really something else.''
   Police were investigating whether Battle, arrested Nov. 20 and
charged with burglary and theft, ever actually examined patients
during his hospital rounds.
   A nurse became suspicious of Battle when he entered a
labor-delivery scrub room wearing gloves from a neighboring
hospital. Questioned about what he was doing, Battle gave the name
of a patient he planned to examine. After the patient's name didn't
show up in hospital records, the nurse called security.
   Battle had created his own University of Miami medical school
photo ID card identifying him as a doctor, NeeDelman said.
   Battle was scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 12 on charges of
burglary, a second-degree felony, and petty theft, a misdemeanor.
   He can't be charged with impersonating a doctor because no
statute exists, said Leslie Rothenberg, assistant state attorney in
the felony screening unit.

   Residents popped champagne corks and
cut a cake as they celebrated the closing of a nearby landfill that
fouled the air and lured thousands of seagulls into the area.
   About 50 residents on Wednesday applauded from across the street
as they watched a city worker close the gate for the final time.
   ``We're celebrating. The seagulls will finally leave,'' said
David E. Gann.
   The 137-acre landfill opened 14 years ago and received about
1,500 tons of garbage daily. Garbage is piled more than 100 feet
high.
   ``It's long overdue. The odor is terrible,'' said Regan Askwith.
   Although the dump is now closed, some residents fear groundwater
filtering through the dump will pollute nearby Greenfield Creek, a
tributary of the St. Johns River.
   The closing of the landfill means that Jacksonville's 3,000 tons
of garbage a day will be trucked to the city's remaining landfill on
the Northside.

   Police killed a suspected poacher in Tsavo
National Park, bringing to four the number killed in the
southeastern Kenya game sanctuary within two weeks, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   He died in a gunbattle Wednesday evening between police and seven
suspected poachers, six of whom escaped, Police Commissioner Philip
Kilonzo told the Daily Nation.
   The shootout in Tsavo National Park, 225 miles southeast of
Nairobi, occurred the day after a court in the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa sentenced two men to three-year prison terms each after
convicting them of poaching and firearms charges.
   Abdi Osman and Hassan Slat, both 20, were charged with killing
elephants, being in possession of 11 elephant tusks, firearms and
ammunition.
   They were arrested Nov. 16 following another shootout between
seven suspected poachers and police in Tsavo. Police killed three
suspects, arrested Osman and Slat. A third suspect escaped.
   Authorities launched a crackdown against poachers in August
following disclosures by the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife that
92 elephants in the country's national parks and game reserves had
been slaughtered within four months for their ivory.

   A 19-year-old East German man escaped
over his homeland's border fortifications into central West Germany,
but his companion was caught by communist guards, West German border
police said Thursday.
   The escape took place Wednesday night near the town of Rotenburg
about 75 miles north of Frankfurt, police said.
   Plice said another man was arrested and taken away by East German
border troops as he tried to clamber over a 10-foot-high steel mesh
fence.
   Border police identifed the escapee as a laborer who said he was
dissatisfied with economic and political conditions in his homeland.
Police did not identify him.
   So far this year, 365 East Germans have escaped into West Germany
or West Berlin over East Germany's border barriers.

   Zambia on Thursday blamed South African
agents for two recent bombings that killed two civilians in the
capital of Lusaka.
   Secretary of State for Defense Alex Shapi said security police
believed the culprits were Zambians in the pay of Pretoria or actual
South African agents.
   A bomb exploded in a car Friday night at a motel on the outskirts
of Lusaka, killing one member of the African National Congress and
injuring another. The car was owned by the ANC, the main
guerrilla-backed movement fighting the white government in South
Africa.
   A second blast, from either a bomb or a land mine, was triggered
Tuesday night in the Lusaka suburb of Makeni. A Zambian who set off
the device with his car was killed and a passenger was injured.
   The explosion occurred near a refugee camp housing South African
blacks.

days, the Culture Ministry said.
   Strikers had protested a change in working hours due to the
opening of a new section of the museum next year.
   Under the agreement, which goes into effect this spring, the
museum will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. four days a week. It will
be open until 9:45 p.m. Wednesday and one another day to be decided,
and closed on Tuesday.
   The new Napoleon Hall, devoted to special exhibits, the museum's

   France is expected to end its visa requirement for
American visitors before the end of the year, Tourism Minister
Olivier Stirn said.
   ``It is a governent decision and not just mine,'' he said on
French radio Tuesday. ``I can tell you that we think, effectively,
that before the end of the year a positive decision will be made.''
   France began requiring visas of foreign visitors previously
exempted following a September 1986 bomb wave in Paris which killed
11 people.
   Only visitors from the European Community remained exempt.
   ``Today, terrorism has been suppressed,'' Stirn said. ``Security
reigns in France.''
   Stirn said the United States envisaged doing away with visas for
French citizens as well as ``a certain number of other Europeans.''
   ``This would be a measure that would go well with the
bicentennial of the French Revolution'' being celebrated in 1989,
the minister said.

   The Los Angeles City Council ignored its own
policy when it voted to display a ``decorated tree'' and an unlit
menorah in the City Hall lobby during the holidays.
   Council members interpreted the Christian and Jewish symbols as
secular rather than religious when they approved the display
Wednesday.
   According to council policy, only displays sponsored by city
offices and which relate to the official function of those offices
are allowed.
   Councilman Hal Bernson warned that allowing the tree and menorah
would open the door to any group seeking to put a display at City
Hall.
   Bernie Evans, a spokesman for City Councilwoman Joan Milke
Flores, said city policy prohibits such displays in the rotunda, but
not in the Main Street lobby where the tree and menorah are to be
set up Friday.
   ``It's the holiday season and it's just pretty ridiculous not to
have anything representing the holiday spirit at City Hall,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Staffers for Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. often
performed household chores at the political maverick's Virginia
estate, where they cooked, put on musical concerts and cleaned the
house, LaRouche's conspiracy trial was told today.
   Pam Cowdery, who left the LaRouche organization in 1986, gave
jurors a glimpse of life at LaRouche's home in Virginia's horse
country.
   Ms. Cowdery said she personally cooked for LaRouche and his wife,
Helga, and for their dogs, who were fed ``very special meals'' _
boned chicken breast mixed with dog food.
   The witness said she also performed in musical concerts as a
singer and violinist, adding that some performances were for guests
while others were just for Lyndon and Helga LaRouche.
   Prosecutors questioned Ms. Cowdery about the lifestyle LaRouche
was leading at a time when people who loaned more than $30 million
to LaRouche's movement were not getting repaid. A federal grand jury
has charged LaRouche and six co-defendants with conspiring to
defraud those who loaned them money.
   Ms. Cowdery said that music and other cultural events virtually
stopped for most LaRouche staffers in 1984 when William Wertz, a
defendant, took over as LaRouche's fund-raising chief.
   Ms. Cowdery said that when staffers complained that the musical
programs were being harmed because performers spent most of their
time on fund-raising, LaRouche replied, ``You have to understand
that everything Will (Wertz) does is under my directions. I make the
policy and Will just carries it out.''
   In earlier testimony, the trial was told that LaRouche's
``security'' fund was used to pay for items including a piano,
haircuts, flowers, shoes and cufflinks, according to testimony in
his tax fraud trial.
   LaRouche financial officer Kathy Magraw acknowledged on Wednesday
that the movement's security account paid for items which _
according to prosecutors _ should have been declared as taxable
income.
   LaRouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service. A grand jury accused him of failing to declare as
income the personal and household expenses financed by his
organizations, and of refusing to file federal tax returns since
1979.
   By calling Ms. Magraw to the stand, prosecutors continued using a
strategy of compelling LaRouche aides to testify about the
movement's finances under grants of limited immunity from
prosecution.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson said Ms. Magraw's testimony
would not only support the tax count, but charges that LaRouche and
six co-defendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not
repaying their loans to his organizations.
   The personal expenditures cited by Ms. Magraw were made while the
LaRouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was
available to repay some $25 million of the more than $30 million
lent to the movement. About $5 million was repaid, according to
earlier testimony.
   Trying to rebut the personal expense testimony, defense lawyers
attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for LaRouche
was for legitimate security and research purposes _ not for his
personal benefit.
   The defense effort was cut short, however, by U.S. District Judge
Albert V Bryan Jr. He refused to allow any defense questioning of
Ms. Magraw on the movement's need for consultants, who were paid
weekly, monthly, daily, and flat payments. Defense lawyers described
the consultants as national security experts.
   The defense struck out, too, when it tried to question the
witness about payments for security protection for two Latin
American members of LaRouche's organization. The defense contended
they were threatened by drug dealers, and were given refuge with
their families in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate.
   The government, on the other hand, was permitted to introduce a
memo prepared by Ms. Magraw, in which she said listing consultant
payments under ``legal investigations, services rendered for
personal research'' was ``not a particularly defensible position
under IRS scrutiny.''
   Ms. Magraw testified that she really didn't know if the expenses
were listed improperly under IRS regulations.
   Robinson, the prosecutor, had Ms. Magraw read for jurors some of
the expenses from LaRouche's ``security'' fund, which was designed
for the personal security of LaRouche, his aides and his guests.
   Among the items was a $7,000 piano and furniture for LaRouche's
Leesburg estate; cufflinks, for LaRouche; shoes for LaRouche's wife,
Helga; film; clothes for LaRouche; flowers; luggage costing $415.96;
a hairdresser appointment for Mrs. LaRouche and a $10 haircut for
LaRouche; a $25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person,
and reimbursement for a wine purchase.
   Ms. Magraw said the furniture and piano were for a building where
the LaRouche organization scheduled political and cultural events.
   LaRouche's political movement embraces a number of unorthodox
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving such
figures as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the queen
of England.

   A strong aftershock in southwest China's
quake-stricken border region destroyed 620 houses and injured 13
people, the official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday.
   The aftershock, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, hit
Wednesday and was centered in the same remote mountain region of
Yunnan province devastated by a Nov. 6 quake in which 730 people
died and more than 4,000 were injured.
   Many of the buildings destroyed in Wednesday's aftershock
suffered damage from the initial quake and were not inhabited,
officials said. Many local residents have been living in tents.
   Xinhua said a lead mine and cement factory in Lancang County,
near the epicenter, suffered new damage in the aftershock and were
forced to close.
   More than 1,000 aftershocks, most far weaker, have hit the region
since the Nov. 6 quake, which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 7.0 or greater is capable of causing
heavy damage in a populated area.
   The Nov. 6 quake was China's most devastating since the 1976
earthquake that leveled the northeastern city of Tangshan, killing
an estimated 242,000 people.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Warning Switch On Delta Jet That Crashed Was Corroded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE PEGO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IRVING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The switch for a takeoff warning system
aboard Delta Flight 1141 was corroded, a veteran Boeing engineer
today told a National Transportation Safety Board panel
investigating the crash of the Boeing 727.
   But engineer Donald R. Ryder told the NTSB board that the F197
throttle switch taken from the plane after it crashed Aug. 31 at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, killing 14 of the 108
people aboard, subsequently passed engineering and circuitry tests.
   The system would have warned the pilots if the jet's wing flaps
were improperly set for takeoff. The flaps provide extra lift during
the slow speeds of takeoff and landing.
   Some of the flaps were found in the incorrect position after the
crash, but it is not known whether they were set that way or whether
they were moved out of position by the impact or by mechanical
failure in the flap controls.
   An exhibit by the NTSB indicated ``the switch exhibited
blue-green corrosion-type substance around the normally open
terminals on the exterior of the housing.'' The exhibit also said
the plunger hole on the switch was enlarged.
   The Air Line Pilots Association said before the public hearing
began Tuesday that its experts believed the plane's takeoff warning
system was inoperative and that the pilots had no idea that the
plane's flaps were improperly set _ some up, some down.
   Ryder said the switch worked perfectly in tests of circuitry
designed to resemble that of the plane.
   But upon questioning, Ryder said the same switch had not worked
in other tests by an NTSB investigator.
   During his test, Ryder said, the button and the plunger of the
switch slipped by each other, meaning they didn't make contact. He
blamed the failure on ``mismanipulation,'' saying the installation
was different from wha one would find on a 727.
   Ryder said any problems with inoperative switches should be found
during routine maintenance and that the switches are virtually
self-cleaning, brushing the contacts clean with each use.
   Witness Robert E. North of Pratt & Whitney said his company's
three engines mounted on Delta Flight 1141 showed no sign of damage
that might have occurred before the crash. The third engine showed
major interior damage, but North said he believed the evidence
indicated the damage must have occurred after the crash.
   On Wednesday, a Boeing aerodynamics supervisor testified that the
plane was traveling fast enough to fly even if its flaps had been
retracted.
   Investigators have been puzzled by the fact the plane's flap
handle was found up, the retracted position, although some of the
plane's flaps and slats were extended.
   NTSB officials say the hearing is only for fact-gathering and
that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public
in six months.
   All three crew members agreed before the board that, to the best
of their recollection, they made all necessary preflight
preparations, including setting the flaps, although they may have
bent several Delta regulations. One of their admitted technical
violations was allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit during a
long delay before takeoff.

<TEXT>
   Miguel de la Madrid left the presidency
Thursday after leading Mexico through six difficult years in which
the measure of his success was avoiding bankruptcy and social
upheaval.
   As he put it in a newspaper interview this week: ``I took a
country with great problems and leave it with problems.''
   Tradition dictates that de la Madrid, at age 53, retire to a
quiet life away from politics, or go to the Mexican Embassy of his
choice if he has a taste for diplomacy.
   He leaves office with a much better image than his predecessor,
Jose Lopez Portillo, whose populist ideology and financial
mismanagement _ combined with the collapse of world oil prices _
almost led to bankruptcy.
   So deep was the crisis in 1982 that even de la Madrid's critics
say avoiding disaster was a major accomplishment.
   De la Madrid takes more personal pride in reforms that opened
Mexico's political system to the opposition at the expense of his
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish initials PRI.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who succeeded him Thursday, won a much
narrower victory than customary for candidates of the PRI, which has
controlled Mexico's government since it was founded in 1929.
   Party faithful were shocked this week when de la Madrid said in
an interview he foresees a time, ``as Mexican society matures, when
the opposition will share in the government.''
   During his six-year term, de la Madrid also attacked some sacred
political and economic cows by reducing protectionism and state
control of the economy. Among other things, he pushed his country
into the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
   A close associate said: ``He had the courage to take unpopular
measures.'' There was a price, for the president and his party. The
opposition took 237 of 500 congressional seats in the July 6
elections and still claims Salinas won the presidency by fraud.
   When de la Madrid took office, the treasury was almost empty and
economic disaster was at hand.
   His term was one of crisis management, negotiations under
pressure with political, labor and business groups at home and with
international banks pressing for payments on a foreign debt reached
$104 billion at one point.
   He resisted urgings to suspend debt payments, choosing instead to
bargain with banks and other creditors for better terms. By the
middle of this year, foreign exchange reserves had reached $16
billion and Mexico was making debt payments of up to $14 billion a
year.
   Among the disasters he could not control were the collapse of oil
prices from $32 a barrel to under $15, an earthquake in 1985 that
killed an estimated 9,000 in Mexico City and Hurricane Gilbert in
September.
   Asked whether he considered himself a bad-luck president, de la
Madrid smiled and said: ``No, just a difficult-times president.''
   Mexico had no economic growth and workers lost nearly half their
real wages because pay was kept low while prices climbed.
   Political opponents claimed his economic policies favored private
business. De la Madrid replied that sacrifices were needed to
maintain a productive source of employment.
   Last year, he enlisted labor and business in the ``Economic
Solidarity Pact'' to fight inflation. The annual rate was 140
percent in 1987, but is expected to be down to 40 percent this year.
   Private business leaders, critics of the government in the past,
praised de la Madrid's sale of state-owned companies, his austerity
measures and his programs to boost exports.
   ``If this continues, the country's economy will grow quickly,''
said Agustin Legorreta, president of the Business Coordinating
Council.

<TEXT>
   Australia said today it will close the
Yugoslav Consulate and expel its staff if authorities there don't
turn over a security guard who shot a teen-age demonstrator.
Yugoslavia rejected the demand.
   The moves were the latest in a diplomatic wrangle over the
wounding of the youth on Sunday and Yugoslavia's refusal to
apologize formally for the shooting at its consulate in Sydney.
   In a statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav government said Australian officials ``failed
to undertake measures to protect our consulate'' from attackers.
   The security guard ``had no choice but shooting into the air to
warn Australian organs...that lives and security of workers in the
consulate and their families were directly imperiled,'' the
statement said.
   The statement was in response to one issued earlier by Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans saying the Australian government had
sufficient evidence to prosecute the security guard who fired the
gun.
   Evans demanded that the guard, identified as Matijas Zoran, be
handed over to police by 6 p.m. Friday or ``the Australian
government will immediately close the consulate-general.''
   About 1,500 people protested at the consulate on Sunday, Yugoslav
National Day. Police said a security guard fired on hundreds of
demonstrators when several Croatian youths began climbing the walls.
   Jospeh Tokic, 16, was shot in the throat and was in stable
condition at a Sydney hospital. Croatians are among several ethnic
groups in Yugoslavia.
   About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in Australia.
   Tanjug said the Yugoslav government referred to the demonstrators
as Ustashas, Croatian fascists who allied with Nazi Germany against
Yugoslav resistance forces during World War II.
   Yugoslav Ambassador Boris Cizelj allowed police to question the
guard after consulting with his government in Belgrade. But he
insisted the interview be conducted inside the consulate and in the
presence of the consul-general.
   He said Zoran would not leave the country until police complete
their investigation.
   The Belgrade government lodged an official protest over what it
called a lack of police protection during the demonstration.

<TEXT>
   The federal government's Fernald
uranium-processing plant will lay off about 350 employees soon
because of decreased demand for the enriched uranium it produces,
officials announced today.
   The layoff, the second since April at the U.S. Energy
Department's Feed Materials Production Center, will include both
management and production-line employees and could begin before
Christmas, said Pete Kelley, a spokesman for the plant's operator,
Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio.
   Workers to be affected will be notified Dec. 9, he said.
   Kelley said the layoffs have nothing to do with a strike by 625
unionized production workers, which has idled the plant since Oct.
7. Westinghouse Materials laid off 70 employees at the government
plant in April because of declining orders for uranium and said then
that another layoff was likely later this year.
   ``They would have occurred anyway, because the production is down
substantially for this fiscal year from last,'' Kelley said.
   The plant's operating budget last year was $145 million but was
cut to $107 million this year, he said.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. said it will provide affected
employees with job counseling, asistance with resume writing,
interview skills training and a placement center.
   The plant now employs about 1,500 people. It has supplied uranium
recently for the Energy Department's Rocky Flats plant in Colorado,
the Hanford reactors in Washington state, the Savannah River plant
in South Carolina and the Oak Ridge, Tenn., nuclear complex. The
Savannah River reactors are shut down because of problems there, and
the Rocky Flats plant reportedly is under consideration for eventual
closure by the Energy Department.
   The Fernald plant, located 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, has
been under heavy criticism in recent years. The Energy Department
recently admitted that the plant has released at least 300,000
pounds of radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere during its 37
years of operation.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the
executions of two Sikhs condemned to death for the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, news reports said.
   A panel of five justices granted a stay of execution for Satwant
Singh, a guard who shot Mrs. Gandhi, and Kehar Singh, convicted of
conspiracy.
   The two were scheduled to hang Friday but the Supreme Court
agreed to stay the execution until Tuesday in order to hear
arguments on a petition filed by Kehar Singh's son.
   They are not related. Members of the Sikh faith use the name
Singh, which means lion.
   The petition challenges President Ramaswamy Venkataraman's
refusal to grant clemency to his father without reviewing the merits
of the case, United News of India and Press Trust of India reported.
   Venkataraman last week said he could not go into the merits of a
case already decided by the Supreme Court. The petition filed by
Rajinder Singh, however, contends the Constitution gives the
president such powers, the news agencies said.
   The judges also stayed Satwant Singh's execution after his lawyer
appealed against another high court decision dismissing his appeals
earlier in the day.
   Two Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot Mrs.
Gandhi in the garden of her residence on Oct. 31, 1984.
   She was apparently killed in retaliation for an army raid she
ordered four months earlier to rout militants from the Golden
Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine. More than 1,200 people died, most
of them Sikhs.
   Beant Singh was killed in a shootout with other security guards
and is revered as a martyr by many militant Sikhs.
   Kehar Singh, Beant's uncle, was arrested a month later and
charged with helping to plot Mrs. Gandhi's murder, which triggered
anti-Sikh riots across northern India by members of the majority
Hindu religion. More than 2,700 people died, nearly all of them
Sikhs.
   Sikh violence since then has escalated. More than 2,300 people
have died this year alone in northern Punjab state, where Sikhs are
fighting for an independent homeland.
   Authorities had ordered increased security in the capital and in
Punjab, fearing the executions could trigger a new outbreak of
communal violence.
   Kehar Singh, 54, and Satwant Singh, 30, have been held at the
maximum-security Tihar Central Jail in New Delhi since their arrests
in 1984.
   Their eight-month trial ended on Jan. 22, 1986. The convictions
and death sentences were subsequently upheld by an appeals court and
by the Supreme Court.

   Police arrested members of the Mafia in
cities throughout Italy today as a similar sweep targeting
drug-trafficking rings took place in the United States.
   The ANSA news agency said authorities involved in operation
``Iron Tower'' began arresting people during the night in Palermo,
Bologna and Florence.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions, in a statement released in Rome
and Washington today, said drug charges have been filed against 75
people in the United States and 133 people in Italy.
   He said the arrests were under way in nine unspecified Italian
cities and in Baltimore; Buffalo, New York; Miami; Newark, New
Jersey; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco; and Rockford, Ill.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the people named in the Italian
arrest warrants were members of the Satola, Gambino and Inzerillo
crime families in Italy and the United States. The state-run RAI-TV
said several top Mafia figures were among those arrested.
   Italian news agencies said the drug raids resulted from an
investigation that stemmed from the ``Pizza Connection''
international drug ring that sold $1.6 billion of heroin, mostly
through pizzerias in the United States.
   A U.S. court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring and
Italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged involvement.
   ANSA and the Italian news agency AGI said the investigation that
led to today's raids was triggered by the arrest of women drug
couriers at airports in Palermo and New York two years ago.
   It said the women were paid about $7,800 for every 2.2 pounds of
heroin they smuggled from Italy to the United States inside money
belts.
   FBI agents used court-authorized wiretaps, physical surveillance
and heroin and cocaine buys to develop the evidence that led to the
arrests in Italy and the United States, Sessions said.
   He said the FBI also discovered cocaine was being sent from South
America to a laboratory 300 miles north of Madrid, Spain, to be
processed and sent to Italy. In Italy, the cocaine was then
exchanged for heroin that was smuggled into the United States. He
said the information led to arrests in Spain.

   NATO defense ministers Thursday urged
U.S. allies to boost defense spending, upgrade military equipment
and play a greater role in maintaining a strong Western alliance.
   The recommendations came in a ``burden-sharing'' report that
responds to criticism from U.S. congressman who argue the United
States is picking up too much of the defense tab.
   Ministers adopted the report at the start of a two-day meeting.
   The report acknowledged ``significant differences between
individual national contributions.''
   But it contended countries such as West Germany bear high social
costs because of 400,000 foreign troops stationed there.
   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said the review on his
country was ``rather positive. I didn't expect it any other way.''
   U.S. critics have suggested the United States withdraw some of
its 326,000 troops stationed in Europe if the Europeans do not pay
more.
   ``As the alliance approaches its 40th anniversary, its strength
and cohesion remain as firm as ever, with continuing major
contributions being made by both the European and North American
pillars,'' the report said.
   But it noted both rich and poor countries have earmarked for
defense less and less as a percentage of total economic activity or
gross domestic product.
   Italy, Luxembourg, Norway and Spain were singled out for
maintaining or increasing slightly their levels of defense spending.
   Allocating money for defense was crucial. ``But making available
people and space, accepting limitations in personal freedom or the
quality of life, braving internal or external tensions, and
different degrees of exposure or vulnerability are by no means less
important elements of the overall burden,'' the report said.
   It estimated the United States tagged an average 5.98 percent of
its economic output to defense from 1983 to 1987. Well ahead was
Greece, which spent 6.52 percent.
   Britain devoted 5.01 percent of its GDP to defense; Turkey
averaged 4 percent, and Germany 3.2 percent.
   Others were: Belgium, 3.26 percent; Canada, 2.17 percent;
Denmark, 2.2 percent; Italy, 2.16 percent; Luxembourg, 1.18 percent;
Netherlands, 3.32 percent; Norway, 2.93 percent; Portugal, 3.22
percent; and Spain, 2.37 percent. Iceland was not included in the
table.
   All NATO's 16 nations except France and Spain are members of the
Defense Planning Committee, which approved the report.
   The report praised the Reagan administration for ``an exceptional
and sustained effort to modernize and upgrade all aspects of its
armed forces.''
   But it said the defense spending surge ``seems to have come to an
end and is likely to be followed by a period of stabilization.''
   European countries, it said, provide 90 percent of the manpower,
80 percent of combat aircraft, 70 percent of tanks and 80 percent of
artillery in the alliance.
   But it urged many European members and Canada to make bigger
contributions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Italian authorities announced today
they have charged more than 200 people, including major figures in
the Sicilian Mafia, in a joint undercover operation targeting
international cocaine and heroin drug-trafficking rings in both
countries.
   Arrests were under way in Baltimore; Buffalo, N.Y.; Miami;
Newark, N.J.: New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco, and Rockford,
Ill. In Italy, arrests were being made in Palermo, Bologna and
Florence.
   Among the 75 people charged in the United States and 133 in Italy
were some of the ``top leaders'' of organized crime, FBI Director
William Sessions said.
   An FBI spokesman, William Carter, said that, by midday, 52 people
had been arrested in the United States and 22 in Italy.
   Sessions said the arrests culminated a ``long-term, undercover
operation'' that he said ``builds strong cases against top leaders''
of organized crime.
   The FBI said it used court-authorized wiretaps, physical
surveillance and heroin and cocaine buys to develop evidence leading
to the arrests here and in Italy.
   The Italian news agency AGI said the two-year investigation that
led to the raids stemmed from the ``Pizza Connection'' international
drug ring that sold $1.6 billion of heroin, mostly through pizzerias
in the United States.
   A U.S. court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring,
and Italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged
involvement. At FBI headquarters in Washington, Carter declined to
comment about any tie-in between the Pizza Connection and the
current probe.
   In a statement, the FBI said the operation developed from what
originally were independent criminal probes in Buffalo, New York and
Philadelphia.
   They grew into a coordinated probe when agents found links
between many of the targets of the separate investigations.
   The Buffalo case was initially designed to concentrate on
drug-trafficking rings in the western New York area and was code
named ``Busico,'' which stands for ``Buffalo Sicilian Connection.''
   It ultimately became tied to a probe in Philadelphia called the
``Iron Tower'' case, eventually requiring the cooperation of six FBI
field offices, three Italian police agencies, other U.S. government
agencies and overseas support of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Undercover FBI agents traveled to Italy to discuss major drug
buys. Italian police inspectors worked with FBI agents on the
investigation in New York and Philadelphia.
   In Italy, the news agency ANSA said police were seeking at least
37 people there who were named in arrest warrants issued by
anti-Mafia magistrate Giovanne Falcone. It said all the people named
in the warrants were members of the Spatola, Gambino and Inzerillo
crime families in Italy and the United States.
   The state-run RAI-TV said Italian authorities, with the help of
U.S. investigators, arrested several top Mafia figures. It said 300
policemen, helped by helicopters and dogs, were reportedly employed
in the sweep.
   As one part of the investigation, the FBI said it developed
information that cocaine was being sent from South America to a
laboratory 300 miles north of Madrid, Spain. There the cocaine was
processed and sent to Italy and exchanged for heroin that was
shipped to the United States. The FBI told Spanish and Italian
authorities about the exchange and arrests were subsequently made in
Spain.
   AGI and ANSA said the probe that led to the raids began after the
arrest of women drug couriers at airports in Palermo and New York
two years ago. It said the women were paid $7,800 for every two
pounds of heroin they smuggled from Italy to the United States
inside money belts.

   A fire burned an oil-soaked pier today,
killing one man and destroying at least 11 boats and two cars,
authorities said. A tower of black smoke hung over the area, and
some people were evacuated.
   The dead man was asleep in his boat when the fire broke out and
spread to his vessel, said Morro Bay Fire Department spokesman Fred
Harpster. At least two other people were injured in the early
morning blaze.
   Authorities ordered the evacuation of an area downwind from the
fire for about a quarter-mile after hearing reports that the pier
was treated with creosote, a carcinogenic substance.
   The waterfront of this town 175 miles northwest of Los Angeles is
lined with restaurants and souvenir shops along a strip known as the
embarcadero. The pier that burned was known as the T Pier because of
its shape.
   Bill Morgan and his wife, Mary Ann, said they saw the fire break
out and after Morgan called the Fire Department they returned to the
pier to knock on boats and awaken the live-aboard occupants.
   Shortly afterward, Morgan said, ``The fire just went whoosh'' and
engulfed the pier off the city's waterfront.
   ``There's a huge cloud of dark, oily smoke,'' said Fred Peterson
of radio station KSLY. ``The pier is an old pier and soaked with oil
from over the years. It's a stubborn fire.''
   The crew of the Coast Guard cutter Point Winslow towed the
burning boats away from the pier. The boats, both fishing and
pleasure craft, were left burning as firefighters turned their
attention to controlling the pier blaze.
   Coast Guard spokesman Fred Smith said the Point Winslow also was
putting water on the fire, and another cutter, the Point Judith, was
en route to the scene.
   Shortly before 8 a.m., the fire appeared to be under control,
witnesses said, with Harbor Patrol and Coast Guard craft maneuvering
to douse hot spots.
   Smith said a Coast Guard Marine Safety crew was en route from San
Francisco to check for pollution in the coastal area of the town.

   ``We are encouraged by this renewed commitment in Pakistan to
constitutional procedures and look forward to continuing our close
relations with Pakistan's new government.''
   In Islamabad, Khan announced that he was appointing Mrs. Bhutto
as prime minister on the basis of her showing in the recent
elections.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phylis Oakley said, ``We
welcome the continued unfolding of the constitutional process in an
orderly way in Pakistan.''
   The nomination of Ms. Bhutto as prime minister is ``an historic
event of which the people of Pakistan can be truly proud,'' she said.

   An accountant who was jailed four years for
criticizing the ruling Communist Party has appealed to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission to intercede on behalf of fellow dissidents
still in prison.
   Ren Wanding also renewed his call first made a decade ago that
the party allow the Chinese people to decide in free elections who
should rule them.
   ``I say what everything thinks,'' Ren said in an interview
Thursday marked by a frankness rarely seen in China's tightly
controlled political atmosphere.
   ``The people are not satisfied. When the time is ready they will
stand up,'' he said. ``I have no plans to organize an uprising. It's
a historical necessity.''
   Ren, 44, helped lead the 1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement, a brief
thaw during which authorities tolerated unprecedented calls for
multiparty democracy. He and dozens of other dissidents were
imprisoned in 1979 as counterrevolutionaries.
   Ren, who said he was never given a trial, was released in 1983
after four years of ``education by labor,'' including two years in
solitary confinement.
   He said he was speaking out after nearly a decade of silence in
order to mark the movement's anniversary and draw attention to
colleagues still in jail.
   ``If the U.N. Human Rights Commission and international society
do not expose the human rights violations of their members ... this
will promote evil and do damage to justice and the lofty purpose of
the United Nations,'' Ren wrote to the United Nations.
   He urged the world community to investigate the conditions of
China's jailed dissidents. Human rights groups, he wrote, should
ask, ``Are they dressed warmly in prison, and are they bothered by
flies in summer?
   ``What is their nutrition and medical treatment like? Are these
people still beaten in prison? Are they required to donate blood
even though they suffer from poor nutrition? Are they still given
meat and canned food that has gone bad? ... Are they still allowed
out just once every month or two months, and given only a minute or
two for a trip to the toilet?''
   ``Having been in prison, I am familiar with the suffering,'' Ren
said in the interview. He said he was held in solitary confinement
for two years, and was allowed books only after the first year.
   Ren also issued a statement this week to the foreign media urging
foreign businesses to demand China improve its human rights policy
before investing.
   The Democracy Wall Movement began with a few pro-democracy
posters plastered on a brick wall in Beijing. Encouraged by
reformist statements by top leader Deng Xiaoping, students and
workers put hundreds more posters on the wall and similar walls in
other cities. Home-printed magazines circulated openly demanding
rule by law, multi-party elections and an end to party privileges.
   Ren, along with more than a dozen friends, edited a journal
called Chinese Human Rights, mimeographing hundreds of copies in
their homes.
   By 1979, however, Deng had consolidated his hold over leftists in
the party and cracked down on the democracy movement.
   More than a dozen of its leaders remain jailed, Ren said. The
best known is Wei Jingsheng, who wrote an impassioned plea for
democracy as a ``fifth modernization'' to go along with the official
program of modernizing agriculture, industry, science and the
military.
   Last year, Amnesty International said it had unconfirmed reports
Wei had died in prison, but China denied it. Ren said he had no
direct information on Wei but believed him to be at a labor camp in
western China's Qinghai province.
   Other activists in the Democracy Wall Movement have remained
silent since. Thousands of students in Beijing and other cities
joined in pro-democracy marches in the winter of 1986-87, but no
nationally renowned leaders emerged and the demonstrations subsided
under a government crackdown.
   Since then, the only dissident who has openly criticized Marxism
and one-party rule is Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist who says his
fame gives him some protection from government retribution. He was
expelled from the Communist Party in 1987 for allegedly having
helped incite the student protests.
   Ren said he also has no plans to form an opposition, but will
continue to speak out.
   ``How can I not speak?'' Ren said. ``I can't be afraid of arrest,
if I am I can't do anything. If they arrest me, they arrest me.''

   The trees are bare and the slanting sunlight
of late autumn does little to ease the chill in Brookdale Cemetery,
but Anthony Scaccia's young friends still congregate at his grave.
   More than a year after Anthony was killed at the age of 13 by a
drunken, hit-and-run driver, his friends still spend hours at his
burial plot, talking, sharing funny stories and gossip, keeping him
company.
   They leave flowers, loose change, pumpkins at Halloween, dolls,
chewing gum, wreaths _ anything they think Anthony would like.
Etched with Anthony's name on his headstone are a dirt bike and a
fishing pole, emblems of his greatest passions.
   It has become a place where the pain of death can be confronted
and, sometimes, eased.
   ``Before Anthony died, if I'd come home late and told my mother I
was at the cemetery she'd have been wary,'' said 14-year-old Billy
Fox. ``But now if I say it she understands why we're there. It's a
place to talk and think about things. It's a peaceful place to talk
to Anthony.''
   ``You don't want anybody to walk by and say, `Oh, it's a typical
grave,''' said Fox, who brings his friend toy soldiers and flags.
``We want people to say, `Wow , that kid must have been real!'''
   ``They all sit around in front of his headstone and talk to
Anthony about what's going on in their lives. They ask how he's
doing up there and what it's like,'' said Anthony's mother, Dianne
Scaccia. ``Billy Fox said sometimes in the summer he lays out and
stretches his arms across the grass and feels Anthony's hand.''
   The outpouring of love and allegiance to her son does not
surprise Mrs. Scaccia, who has four other children.
   ``Anthony was a kind of special kid. He had a great many
friends,'' she said Wednesday. ``He was adventurous and the kids got
into the habit of following him around and depending on him to plan
out what to do. It wasn't unusual for us to wake up at 8 a.m. on
summer mornings and have 16 or 17 kids waiting outside for him.''
   Public Works Commissioner Dominic DiVirgilio, who tends the
cemetery, has watched from a distance as small groups of Anthony's
friends have gathered.
   ``I have never stopped or interfered, mainly because I know what
they are going through,'' DiVirgilio said. ``They've been going down
to more or less deal with losing someone as young as that, to deal
with death and reality. I've never seen it as anything other than
respectful and healthy.''
   Anthony was struck by a car on Oct. 3, 1987, when he and several
friends were crossing a highway.
   Thirty of his friends showed up at the hospital that night to
await word. School officials had to call in extra guidance
counselors from neighboring schools to help students deal with their
grief.
   The man driving the car turned himself in four days later. He was
convicted of motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of
alcohol and was sentenced to five to eight years in prison.
   Mark DeFilippo, 14, said he and his friends find it easier to
wrestle with Anthony's death at graveside.
   ``I think it's a way of keeping him alive,'' he told the Dedham
Daily Transcript recently. ``We go there to keep him with us. But we
also go to talk. Talking helps me and everyone.''
   Teen-agers said they leave sentimental gifts for Anthony, things
that might give him a chuckle or keep him from feeling out of step
with the latest fad.
   ``Everybody knows he's up there. By going down to visit, we're
keeping him from feeling left behind or lonely,'' said Donna Galvin,
a middle school student whose grandmother's grave is next to
Anthony's. ``This way everyone knows he's still there.''
   ``I talk to him and say `What's going on? How ya doin'? What's
going on up there? We all miss you,''' Fox said. ``We start laughing
about something and say `Hey, remember that Anthony.'
   ``And I myself, I think he hears us, and I think he laughs. But
we can't hear him, ya know.''

<HEAD>Parliament Gets Electric Sale Bill: Largest Step in Privatization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday
submitted legislation to sell the electricity monopoly, a sale three
times larger than previous steps in her campaign to dispose of
nationalized industries.
   Financial analysts have said the sale of the power generating and
distribution system in England and Wales, to be completed by
mid-1991, may be worth anywhere from $30 billion to $50 billion. Two
separate companies will be set up in Scotland, while Northern
Ireland is not affected.
   The largest previous sale of shares, in British Gas in 1986,
earned the government $14.2 billion. The electricity sale is apt to
equal the proceeds of all previous sales, including British
Petroleum, Rolls Royce, Jaguar and British Airways.
   Electricity and the privatization of the English and Welsh water
supply are the two main flotations set to go through Parliament in
the coming year.
   ``The proposals in this bill are radical, but they are
evolutionary,'' Energy Minister Cecil Parkinson said at a news
conference introducing the legislation.
   ``They preserve all that is best in the present system,
maintaining security of supply. And they offer the prospect of real
competition, the best guarantee of customers' interests, in an
industry where there has been no competition for 30 years.''
   Competition would be fostered by splitting the Central
Electricity Generating Board into two companies: PowerGen, which
will own 30 percent of CEGB's non-nuclear capacity, and National
Power, which will take over the nuclear plant and remaining
non-nuclear capacity.
   In advance of the bill's introduction, the opposition Labor Party
had charged that privatization would lead to increases of up to 25
percent in electric rates.
   ``Vague waffle about long-term downward pressure on costs is no
consolation for consumers facing immediate and harsh pressure on
their living standards,'' Labor's energy spokesman, Tony Blair, said
Wednesday.
   ``There are no new costs created by privatization. There is no
new levy created by privatization,'' Parkinson asserted Thursday.
   He added: ``The idea that public ownership and the monopoly are
some sort of insurance against price increases is a sick joke.''
   Blair complained the bill introduced Thursday lacked important
details. ``The meat will be in the various licenses, regulations and
contracts to follow,'' he said.
   Parkinson said he hoped that eventually as many as 20 companies
would be competing to generate and sell electricity.
   Power will be sold to a dozen private supply companies, created
from existing regional boards, which would serve homes and industry.
   The transmission facilities owned by CEGB would be transferred to
a new company, the National Grid Co., jointly owned by the 12 supply
companies.
   Parkinson declined to say how much the government might gain from
a sale. ``It is far too early to say,'' Parkinson said. ``We haven't
gotten anywhere near putting a value on the assets.''
   CEGB has assets worth $50 billion and employs 47,000 people. The
regional boards have 81,500 employees.
   Shares will be sold to foreigners as well as British citizens,
Parkinson said. The limit on share ownership has not been decided,
but he said limiting any one stockholder to 15 percent of shares had
worked well in other privatization plans.
   Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, the government has
raised $30.5 billion by selling state-owned companies.
   The latest to go on sale is British Steel, whose deadline for
share applications expires on Friday.

   Carlos Salinas de Gortari was inaugurated as
president of Mexico today despite opposition protests that his
government is illegitimate and won't make promised economic and
political reforms.
   About 150 of the 564 lawmakers walked out just before Salinas was
inaugurated, while members of the National Action Front held up
signs saying ``Fraud.''
   In his inaugural address, the Harvard-educated economist said he
was taking power at a time of conflict and change and promised
``nationalist, democratic and popular'' reforms.
   ``I will be prudent in never risking the destiny of country ...
but firm in maintaining order and the constitution,'' Salinas said.
``I will govern for all Mexicans.''
   A legislator for the opposition Democratic Front, Marcela
Lombardo, was applauded when she told the congress that the front's
candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, had been cheated of victory in the
election by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``This is an ill-fated day, because the right of the people to
select their rulers is being violated,'' said Ms. Lombardo, who
spoke before Salinas' inauguration.
   Salinas took power from President Miguel de la Madrid at a
special session of congress after the opposition speeches. The
opposition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony if that was not
permitted.
   According to official figures Salinas won barely more than 50
percent of the presidential vote, while Cardenas won 31 percent and
the conservative National Action Party candidate, Manuel Clouthier,
had 17 percent.
   ``I want to be the voice of those who, believing in better times,
were once again victims of contempt for their rights,'' said
National Action delegate said Abel Vicencio Tovar.
   The people of Mexico voted ``for another program radically
different from the one applied during the administration that is
ending,'' said Ms. Lombardo, a delegate from Mexico City.
   Salinas is a disciple and exponent of the free market, while
leftist Cardenas called for a bigger government role in the economy
and suspension of payments on the nation's debt.
   On Wednesday night, President Fidel Castro of Cuba, President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and other heads of state attended a
private dinner for Salinas despite protests from Salinas' opponents.
   Cardenas has said the Mexican government invited heads of state
to an inaugural for the first time in an effort to make up for their
lack of support inside Mexico. He said those who came would be
supporting an ``illegitimate government.''
   The Salinas transition team says the invitations are a courtesy
because the Mexican president has been invited to other
inaugurations.
   With Cabinet appointments announced Wednesday, Salinas served
notice that he intends to push ahead with the economic policies he
designed while serving as his predecessor's budget director:
encouraging competition and reducing state involvement in the
economy in an effort to promote growth.
   Several key appointees are young, worked with Salinas under de la
Madrid and, like Salinas, have degrees in economics from top-ranked
U.S. schools.
   Salinas has said his biggest concern is ``to get Mexico to grow
again,'' and to do that the country needs both new investment and
the use of resources that now go abroad as payments on Mexico's $102
billion foreign debt.
   In charge of renegotiating that debt will be Treasury Secretary
Pedro Aspe, 38, who earned a doctorate from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   Salinas inherits a country with a lot of problems: the debt, an
economy that has been stagnant for six years, an inflation rate of
40 percent, and an electoral system that has lost credibility.
   The new president will need a quick success to demonstrate his
command of the job, and he expects help from President-elect George
Bush's incoming administration to win a reduction in debt payments.
   Aside from Castro and Ortega, others in Mexico for the
inauguration were presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Raul
Alfonsin of Argentina, Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador, Jose
Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and
Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel of Belize.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and included Bush's son, John, and his Mexican-American wife
Columba.

   President Reagan will nominate national
security adviser Colin Powell for promotion to four-star rank and
the post of commander-in-chief of the Army's Forces Command, the
White House and Pentagon announced today.
   The promotion would make the 51-year-old Powell, now a lieutenant
general with three stars, the fourth black officer to attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. One of those four is
currently on active duty _ Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph.
   The promotion requires Senate confirmation.
   In the new post, Powell would be in charge of all the Army troops
in the continental United States. The command is headquartered at
Ft. McPherson in Atlanta and has traditionally been a major career
stepping stone for senior Army commanders.
   ``President Reagan has the highest respect and affection for
General Powell and wishes him all success in his Army career,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing the
nomination. He noted that Powell and Reagan ``have had a close
personal relationship.''
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Seucirty Council itself,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
   ``General Powell has been a friend and colleague whose advice and
counsel have been valued by all members of the White House staff. He
is a man of rare quality and distinction,'' the spokesman added.
   The spokesman said that Powell is expected to assume command in
April, 1989, when the current commander, Gen. Joseph T. Palastra
Jr., retires. Palastra has held the post since June 1986 and is
retiring after 35 years of active military service.
   After leaving the White House Powell plans to visit a number of
army units before assuming his command, Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Powell's new job includes preparing soldiers
for world-wide deployment and to defend the U.S. continent.
   The upcoming promotion was first reported Thursday by the Cox
News Service and confirmed a short while later by administration
officials. The Pentagon later released a short statement announcing
President Reagan's intent to nominate Powell for the job.
   Sources at the Pentagon said the FORSCOM position was one of the
few Army four-star posts scheduled to open in the next few months.
   Powell succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as President Reagan's national
security adviser after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring
Caspar W. Weinberger.
   Carlucci was called back to government service by President
Reagan to replace Navy Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in the wake of
the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Carlucci immediately
recruited Powell as his deputy, drawing him away from a major
command in Europe, and Powell moved up to the top White House spot
after Carlucci's move to the Pentagon.
   Powell is a graduate of City University in New York and received
an MBA degree from George Washington University in Washington.
   Commissioned in the infantry, he was wounded during both of his
two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened
bamboo sticks, impaling a foot.
   In 1977 Powell was assigned to the Pentagon as an assistant to
the deputy assistant secretary of defense. While later serving as an
assistant to Carlucci in the National Security Council, Powell
received his first star. He went on to become military assistant to
Weinberger before a stint as commander of the Army's Fifth Corps in
Europe.
   Powell's decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

   Former Soviet prisoner Natan Sharansky's wife,
Avital, has given birth to the couple's second daugher since they
were reunited almost three years ago, Sharansky said Thursday.
   ``They are both fine. We still haven't named her, that we will do
in synagogue on Saturday,'' Sharansky told a reporter, smiling, as
he shook hands with well-wishers at a World Conference on Soviet
Jewry in Jerusalem.
   He said the birth occurred Wednesday at Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital. The baby weighed 6 pounds, 8 ounces.
   Sharansky's eldest daughter, Rachel, is 2.
   Sharansky was released from Soviet prison as part of an East-West
spy swap in February 1986, after spending nine years of a 13-year
sentence on charges of anti-Soviet espionage.

   Sinatra, who performed at the Fox before the building began
crumbling in the late 1950s, brought his national tour to a crowded
house at the 1930s theater Wednesday night.
   ``Wonderful old theater,'' he said during the opening act of what
new owner Mike Ilitch billed as ``The Ultimate Event'' featuring
Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis Jr.
   Ilitch, owner of the Little Caesars pizza chain and the Detroit

   Welterweight boxing champion Lloyd Honeyghan said
Thursday he is getting married a few days before his Feb. 4 world
welterweight title defense against Marlon Starling.
   Now he has to tell his future wife.
   ``Something big is going to happen. I'm getting married,'' the
28-year-old Briton told reporters as he boarded a flight to Miami.
``I'm serious, I'm going to do it a couple of days before the
fight.''
   Honeyghan wouldn't say whether his bride would be Jennifer Green,
mother of his two youngest children. The fighter has five children
by three different women.
   In fact, he said, the lady of his choice was not even aware she
was going to a wedding.
   ``The only thing is, my girl doesn't know anything about it yet.
I haven't told her,'' Honeyghan said. ``You'll have to work it out.''

   Martyn Burke, a writer who says the hit movie
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' was based on his 1980 book ``Laughing
War,'' has filed a $30 million lawsuit against Walt Disney
Productions and its Touchstone Pictures company.
   Burke, who filed suit Wednesday, says he spoke with Jeffrey
Katzenberg, then president of Walt Disney Productions, and a
representative for actor Robin Williams in 1982 about developing a
movie from his book, said Burke's attorney, Gregory James Owen.
Williams starred in the movie.
   Katzenberg and Williams' representative, Larry Brezner, declined
to purchase the rights, the lawsuit said.
   Disney officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   The plot of `Good Morning, Vietnam,'' a film about Armed Forces
Radio broadcaster Adrian Cronauer, is based on Burke's book, the
Superior Court lawsuit claims.
   ``Defendants used the purported life story (of Cronauer) as a
subterfuge to conceal the substantial misappropriation of `Laughing
War,''' the lawsuit said.

   Former astronaut Sally Ride, a Stanford
University physicist since 1987, says she might quit the institution
over a dispute involving the school's Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
   Ride, who works on arms control and space policy, said Tuesday
through a colleague that she was ``seriously looking around for
other things'' because of the resignation last week of noted arms
control expert and physicist Sidney Drell and concerns about
university hiring procedure.
   Drell, a government adviser on arms control since the 1960s,
accused the university of dragging its feet over attempts to create
a more permanent center staff for the study of technical, political
and economic aspects of arms control. Since the center is not a
formal department, it has no power to offer faculty status and the
hiring is done by the university.
   Theodore Postel, a Stanford nuclear engineer and physicist,
passed along Ride's job-hunting statement and said he too was
looking for another job.
   ``It's serious for the center,'' Stanford President Donald
Kennedy said of Drell's resignation. ``We are going to have to work
hard to try to find other people and other resources to make up for
what is a big loss.''
   The Stanford center is considered among the top such projects in
the world. Last year, the center organized a global conference on
arms issues for leaders in the field.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand
Marcos, charged with conspiring to steal more than $100 million from
his homeland, writes in a journal to be published this month that he
is being unfairly judged.
   Marcos, whose lawyers claim he's too ill to stand trial or even
to travel from his exile home in Hawaii, writes his defense in the
winter issue of Orbis, to be distributed Dec. 28 by the Foreign
Policy Research Institute, a Philadelphia think tank.
   An advance copy of the article was made available to The
Associated Press.
   Marcos insists in the six-page, 2,500-word essay that he didn't
raid the treasury of more than $5 billion during the 21 years he led
the Philippines until his ouster in 1986, and he didn't allow
friends to siphon off huge sums.
   ``The fact is that none of these charges, which are criminal in
character, has been made subject to judicial scrutiny,'' Marcos
wrote.
   ``Many of the so-called Marcos cronies are in the Philippines
today. They are within the reach of the present administration in
Manila. Although presumably possessed of all the evidence necessary
to establish their guilt, the Aquino administration has not
prosecuted any of these putative malefactors.
   ``Private property has been seized; moral declamations have been
broadcast; but not one single case has been brought before a court
of law. With criminals in such abundance, whose guilt is so evident,
one might have expected that at least one of them would have had to
face prosecution by this time.''
   Marcos wrote that he has asked the government in Manila to allow
him to return and ``afford me the opportunity to face my accusers
(but) it has steadfastly refused my demand for a day in court.''
   Marcos' article was in response to one written in the last issue
of Orbis, distributed in September, by Theodore Friend, former
president of Swarthmore College and currently head of Eisenhower
Exchange Fellowships.
   Friend accused Marcos of wrecking the Philippines politically and
economically through corruption and murder..
   Marcos said the ``omnibus charges repeated by Friend (that) I am
personally responsible for the murder of political opponents, and
the massive derogation of human rights in the Philippines merit
little further comment'' because his request to return and be
subject to his country's courts had been rejected.
   ``To date, the authorities in Manila have refused my request,
have failed to indict, and display a singular unwillingness to
prosecute,'' Marcos wrote.
   Friend, in an answer to Marcos in the same Orbis, called him an
astute lawyer ``who shielded himself with legalisms, many of them
contrived.'' He also said 39 civil suits against him in the
Philippines seek a total of $96.17 billion, and that criminal suits
also are pending there.
   ``Marcos used his regime as a means to preserve and enhance his
own political power; as a means to engorge his friends; and as a
means to enrich his family and himself _ not by `peculations' but by
systematic parasitic robbery,'' Friend wrote.
   Marcos, who rejected every suggestion he was guilty of anything,
said U.S. intervention into Philippine affairs that led to his
ouster and the election of Corazon Aquino as president backfired.
   ``The strangest feature of all this is that not only have U.S.
interests now been placed in serious jeopardy, but all the charges
that made my administration a pariah among policy makers in
Washington have recently resurfaced as charges against the present
regime,'' Marcos wrote.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Oct. 21 in New York on
federal criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering
the Philippines' treasury and stashing much of the money in the
United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New York
and was released on $5 million bail.
   Defense lawyers contend Marcos is too frail to make the 10-hour
flight to New York for arraignment or trial. A court-appointed
physician decided in late November that Marcos is healthy enough to
face charges in New York.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush ascended 35 feet aboard a bumpy
hydraulic boom on Thursday and placed the crowning ornament atop the
National Christmas Tree, a Colorado blue spruce just beyond the back
fence of the house she'll move into next month.
   It was the eighth consecutive year the wife of the vice president
has performed that task, and one she apparently doesn't want to give
up when husband George's title is shortened. ``It's the only thing
I've done more than anyone else,'' she told a guest in a reception
line afterwards. ``I love it.''
   To a separate guest she said ``I would be offended if someone
else did it.''
   President Reagan is to light the live national tree for his last
time Dec. 15, after which a pageant featuring 57 trees, each
decorated with ornaments from a different state or territory, will
be opened. More than 700,000 people visited the exhibit last year.
   The tree was transplanted to its spot on the Ellipse, a park
betwen the White House and the Washington Monument, in 1978 after
two earlier trees died before taking root.
   Two classes of Washington first-graders applauded and cheered as
Mrs. Bush had an animated chat with puppet dinosaurs Rex and Rita
Readasaurus and Pageant Director Joe Riley as they rode the boom
basket skyward.
   ``It was a shakey ride,'' said Lynn Hippen who was crouched down
in the boom box with puppet designer Brad Williams, ``but everyone
maintained their balance and poise.''
   The puppets, Williams said, were ``hatched'' at the National Zoo
in May to promote the national Reading is Fundamental program. He
said they and Mrs. Bush talked about the ride and the children
below, who included two of Mrs. Bush's grandchildren, twins Barbara
and Jenna Bush.
   ``Has anyone read `The Grinch Who Stole Christmas?''' Mrs. Bush
asked the youngsters after coming down from the tree.
   ``I saw it on TV,'' one child said.
   ``It's better if you read it,'' Mrs. Bush said.

<TEXT>
   Pressure to reduce deficits can be expected to
be a major factor as the Bush administration searches for new farm
program formulas, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Thursday.
   ``You cannot avoid having the problems of trade deficit and
fiscal deficit intrude heavily on agricultural policy in the new
administration,'' the outgoing Cabinet member told a meeting at the
Agriculture Department.
   As much as $3 billion may have to be cut from farm programs by
lawmakers in 1989 to meet targets under the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law, said Lyng and two economists on a panel with him at
USDA's Annual Agricultural Outlook Conference.
   Lawmakers might be able to negotiate a lesser cut, they said. But
they added that the full $3 billion could be needed if Congress goes
ahead with the across-the-board reductions envisioned by the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   Farm subsidy programs operated by the government's Commodity
Credit Corp. are running at about $13 billion a year, down from $26
billion in fiscal 1986.
   The three panelists at the closing session of the Outlook
Conference suggested Congress might decide to pass a stopgap farm
bill and hold off until at least 1991 on any major revision of the
array of five-year programs expiring in 1990.
   The crystal ball-gazing session was attended largely by
government officials, agribusiness executives and the news media,
and Lyng reiterated that he will not be at the helm of the
department in the new administration. Numerous possible successors
have been mentioned, but thus far no word has come from
President-elect George Bush or his transition team.
   Lyng said current farm programs, approved in 1985 when
agriculture was reeling from plunging crop prices and land values,
have proven highly popular and ``I don't think we would have any
changes in farm programs if it weren't for budget pressures.''
   ``You've got $3 billion to save in some shape or form and it's
going to drive changes, I think, in 1989,'' the secretary said.
   All the same, there is no certainty that the Bush administration
will propose extensive changes in the year ahead, said Lynn Daft, an
agricultural economist and former USDA official.
   ``You don't have to come forward with legislation right away,''
he said. He noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change.
   ``If I were a new administration coming in, I'd say, why rush?''
he said.
   With farmers largely satisfied, Congress could well decide to
extend the 1985 law for a year or so and tackle any major overhaul
later.
   ``Particularly when you've got eight members of the Senate
Agriculture Committee up for reelection'' in 1990, said William
Lesher, a consultant and former Lyng business partner also appearing
on the panel.
   ``My guess, as the secretary says, is that it's at least a 50
percent chance'' that stopgap legislation will be approved, Lesher
said.
   As for reducing farm program spending by $3 billion, Lesher told
the session there are only three ways to do the job.
   He said one would be to lower target prices _ congressionally set
price levels used in calculating income-support payments. Another
would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments;
and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted.

broadcasts beamed into Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and against Voice
of America and West German broadcasts into Afghanistan, although
other services into those countries were now unhindered.
   Engineers had anticipated that that jamming might also end.
   Leinwoll called the shutdown ``a momentous event'' but cautioned
that the Soviets still have jamming devices in place and said the
United States would maintain its anti-jamming equipment.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States had pressed the Soviet Union at recent summit meetings to end
the jamming. ``We are pleased to see that these efforts have borne
fruit,'' he said.
   Word that the more than 2,000 jamming transmitters in the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European allies had ceased spread through
Europe on Wednesday as shortwave radio operators discovered that the
annoying, raspy hum of Soviet interference was no longer heard over
U.S., West German, Israeli or other broadcasts.
   ``The hum is gone,'' announced Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., chairman of
the Board for Overseas Broadcasting, which directs the $200
million-a-year U.S. broadcasting effort based in Europe. ``We think
this is a very significant move by the Soviet Union,'' Forbes said
at a news conference.
   Future programming aimed at the services' estimated 55 million
listeners could now include more music, fewer repeated programs and
such new features as call-in talk shows, officials said.
   Forbes said radio engineers who had developed sophisticated
techniques for overriding the jamming were surprised by the
development, although there had been some subtle signs of change
during a recent visit by U.S. broadcast executives to Moscow in
September.
   He said the action could bring significant savings to the
economically hard-pressed Soviets, who officials estimate spend up
to $1.25 billion a year on jamming.
   The Soviet government has made no announcement acknowledging that
it had sharply trimmed back its jamming activities.
   Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe are run separately from the
Voice of America and broadcast solely to the Soviet bloc. Soviet
jamming of VOA transmissions stopped in 1987 and VOA now has a
bureau in Moscow.
   VOA covers much broader world news and more U.S. affairs than
Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty, which have been steadily jammed
since they were started in the early 1950s.
   Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and the 3-year-old Radio
Afghanistan are funded by Congress. Radio Liberty is a former CIA
operation, but Forbes said all three stations provide accurate and
objective coverage. Their native-language broadcasts have more
listeners than any other stations in areas where jamming stopped
earlier, such as Hungary and Poland, he said.
   Officials said the continued jamming in some countries could
either have been an oversight or another example of the reluctance
of Europe's toughest communist regimes to embrace Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost or openness.
   Charles Z. Wick, director of the U.S. Information Agency, which
runs VOA, said the lifting of jamming apparently was timed to
coincide with the meeting next week of Gorbachev and President
Reagan.
   ``It's another marker in the Soviet march toward trying to be an
acceptable citizen of the world community as against the pariah that
they have been,'' Wick said in a telephone interview.
   The Soviet action came so quickly that radio engineers were only
becoming aware of it as Secretary of State George Shultz said in a
broadcast to Europe Wednesday morning that radio jamming was one
area where progress was still needed with the Soviets.
   ``The cessation of jamming represents a significant step on the
part of the Soviet government toward the free flow of information,''
said Gene Pell, president of Radio Liberty, which is based in
Munich, West Germany.
   ``Reports from the Soviet Union and the Baltic republics confirm
that Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe broadcasts are being heard
loud and clear,'' said Pell.
   Officials said broadcasts now might include more music, which is
so badly mangled by jamming that it is rarely played on the stations.
   Ken Thompson, a broadcast board official in Washington, said he
first got word the jamming had stopped in a message left by Pell
from Munich on his telephone answering machine Tuesday evening.
   In Europe, jubilant engineers were up late into the night
checking the newly cleared broadcasts, verifying that all
transmissions in 12 Soviet bloc languages were getting through for
the first time in history, Thompson said.
   He said a U.S. Embassy official in Moscow told Radio Liberty he
was ``astonished'' to turn on the radio and get its first
unobstructed broadcast Wednesday morning.

   Rescuers searched the ruins of
mud-and-straw huts Thursday for survivors of a cyclone that shrieked
ashore like ``thousands of demons,'' killing at least 596 people and
leaving half a million homeless.
   Unofficial counts put the number of dead at well over 1,000.
   More than 1,000 people still were officially reported missing
Thursday, nearly 48 hours after the storm raged in from the Bay of
Bengal to devastate southern Bangladesh and eastern India.
   Officials said strong winds and cloudy skies hampered helicopter
search-and-rescue operations.
   ``It looked like the end of the world, as if thousands of demons
were out to kill us,'' said Kazi Mansoor, a government official in
Khulna, 55 miles north of the coast.
   Osman Ghani, a messenger at the Khulna newspaper Janabarta, said:
``I thought the entire town would be blown away. ... The storm
felled trees and power supply lines in hundreds and thousands.''
   The cyclone struck Tuesday night, whipping up 15-foot tidal waves
that submerged low-lying coastal islands lashing the flat mainland
with wind gusts of more than 100 mph.
   It struck while Bangladesh still was recovering from summer
floods that took about 1,500 lives and left nearly one-fifth of the
110 million people homeless in this impoverished land, most of which
is a vast river delta.
   Military officials who accompanied President Hussain Ershad on an
inspection tour Thursday said at least 496 people drowned, were
electrocuted or died when their homes collapsed. Police sources in
neighboring India said at least 100 people were killed in West
Bengal state.
   Official tallies in both countries usually are much lower than
independent estimates, reflecting bureaucratic delays and difficulty
in obtaining accurate information from areas where communications
are poor even in normal times.
   Dhaka newspapers said at least 1,000 people were killed in
Bangladesh and Indian news agencies put the count in West Bengal at
200.
   Ershad flew to the region and toured it by car rather than
helicopter because of the rough weather. Flattened houses and trees,
snapped power poles and devastated croplands were everywhere.
   In Taltala, a village of 500 people 40 miles west of Khulna that
lost 13 of its 21 huts, he said: ``Let us brave the cyclone as we
did the recent flooding.''
   Tuesday's storm covered the greatest area of any recent cyclone
in Bangladesh, but the death toll does not approach that from a 1970
storm that killed at least 300,000. A cyclone in 1985 took 10,000
lives.
   The 1970 storm spent most of its energy along the coast but this
one covered the entire southern half of the country.
   Mansoor, a member of the Khulna municipal government, said
400,000 people were homeless in the city of 1.5 million.
   ``There is an acute shortage of food, drinking water and medicine
for the injured,'' he said when reached by telephone from Dhaka, the
capital. ``Pressed rice and molasses were the only food stuff we
could so far distribute among the homeless and affected people.''
   The storm took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and palm-thatch
huts used by fishermen and rice farmers. ``There is no kutcha (mud
and straw) house standing,'' Mansoor said, but he did not have an
estimate of how many had been flattened.
   About 30 of the country's 64 administrative districts were
affected by the cyclone. The worst known damage was along the coast
and in the southwest corner next to India.
   Many of the dead and homeless were farmers and fishermen who
settled on hundreds of new coastal islands created by silt and
sediment dumped into the Bay of Bengal by rivers originating in the
Himalayas of India and Nepal. Most are narrow sandbars that are
partially submerged even by normal tides.
   Hundreds of such islands, usually less than half a mile long,
have been formed since 1985 by the 2 billion tons of silt a year
that courses through the river deltas into the bay, according to the
government's Water Resources Board.

<HEAD>Berlin Marks 50 Years of Nuclear Fission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago, German scientists Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission, a breakthrough that led
to the atom bomb and nuclear energy.
   On Thursday, Berlin held the first of several events marking the
fateful work.
   The discovery by Hahn and Strassmann also was intertwined with
the Nazi era. Albert Speer, a former top aide to Adolf Hitler,
strongly implied that Hahn was one of a group of German scientists
seeking ways to build an atomic bomb before the Americans beat them
to it.
   Hahn, a physicist and chemist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in
chemistry for his discovery, worked closely with a Jewish colleague
forced into exile by the Nazis.
   The December 1938 work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Chemistry in Berlin also represented one of the many feats of the
proud German scientific tradition.
   On Thursday, scientists and officials of the Technical University
of West Berlin outlined the impact of Strassmann's and Hahn's
discovery at an exhibition of models, photographs and scientific
equipment documenting the work.
   ``The development of nuclear physics and its technology has found
interest among the public like no other discovery,'' said Ulrich
Steinmueller, vice president of the Technical University.
   ``The technology carries implicitly in its use _ both in war and
peace _ a threat for mankind,'' Steinmueller said. ``The
well-founded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge
to be aware of their responsibilities to society.''
   West Germans have been sensitive to some of the end results of
Hahn and Strassmann's discovery: the stationing of nuclear rockets
on their soil and the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident in
1986 in the Soviet Union.
   ``That day 50 years ago in Dahlem (the Berlin district where the
discovery took place) must also be remembered along with the day of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the day of Chernobyl,'' Steinmueller told
the news conference at the Technical University.
   Steinmueller added that the peaceful use of nuclear energy
``leaves open more problems than it solves.''
   Hahn and Strassmann found that bombarding the uranium atom with
neutrons leads to its splitting. At first, they were unsure of what
they had discovered.
   From her exile in Sweden, Jewish colleague Lise Meitner and her
partner, Otto Robert Frisch, furnished the theoretical basis showing
such a splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain
reactions.
   The experiments took place in the middle of December, with the
key test starting Dec. 16, 1938.
   In the years before his discovery, Hahn had worked closely with
Meitner, who had been forced to emigrate in 1938 as the Nazis
stepped up their attacks on the Jews.
   ``It was unusual at that time to have a man and woman working
together when they weren't married,'' said Jost Lemmerich, chief
organizer of the exhibition.
   When Hahn won the prize, no mention was made of the work by
Meitner or Strassmann. Hahn died in 1968 in West Germany.
   During Thursday's news conference, Lemmerich was asked why the
exhibition stops in 1939, without covering the Nazis' scientific
research in World War II.
   ``We stopped there because the history is incomplete,'' he
responded. ``We didn't have access to the documents.''
   But he hinted another exhibition is possible to show the darker
sides of Hahn's discovery.
   ``Couldn't we, say in five years, have another exhibition about
Hiroshima?'' he asked rhetorically.
   West Berlin's Tagespiegel newspaper on Nov. 27 said Hahn wrote in
his diary of the Hiroshima attack that he had a clear conscience
``that neither during the discovery nor later did I want to work for
the use of uranium fission as a war weapon.''
   At the time, Hahn and other top German atomic scientists were
being detained in a British camp, according to the newspaper.
   Speer, Hitler's armaments minister and the Third Reich's top
architect, said that in 1942 he had heard of ``a group of scientists
who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate whole
cities, perhaps throw the island of England out of the fight.''
   He continued that two months later he visited with scientists in
Berlin to be briefed on ``atomic research,'' as the Nazi Reich
struggled to find a way to win World War II.
   ``Along with scientists whose names I no longer recall, the
subsequent Nobel Prize winners Otto Hahn and Werner Heisenberg were
present,'' Speer wrote in his memoirs, ``Inside the Third Reich.''
   Heisenberg told Speer that building such a bomb was possible but
it would take at least two years.

   The left-of-center Labor Party on Thursday
secured the backing of half the Israeli Parliament, enough to
prevent a right-wing Likud government from coming to power but not
enough to seat a government of its own.
   With the 120-member Knesset split between the left and right
blocs, it remained unclear a full month after the elections who will
govern for the next four years.
   In the Nov. 1 ballotting, Likud had an small edge over Labor,
with 40 seats to Labor's 39. Each must woo smaller parties to form a
majority, and Likud's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir planned to do so
with the backing of right-wing and Orthodox religious parties.
   But the defection of an ultra-Orthodox Likud ally to Labor's
ranks has thrown a wrench into the works. Now Labor leader Shimon
Peres has the backing of 60 members, limiting the Likud bloc to 58.
   The two-man Torah Flag Party is undecided, possibly holding the
key to forming the next government in its hands. If Torah Flag
throws its support behind Labor, the bloc would have a majority for
a government, albeit a narrow one.
   Labor signed an agreement of mutual support with the Orthodox
Agudat Israel party Thursday, pulling five new seats into its camp.
   ``If (President Chaim) Herzog asks Shimon Peres to form the
government, all the cards will change. Everything will be dealt
anew,'' said Uzi Baram, general secretary of the Labor Party.
   Shamir, initially asked by Herzog to form a government, has a
Monday deadline.
   The deadlock could force rival Labor and Likud into compromising
on another joint government, such as the one that has ruled Israel
for four years. The uneasy coalition was deeply divided on matters
of war and peace and incapable of taking bold steps to revive the
peace process.
   Labor on Wednesday turned down an offer from Shamir to join a
coalition under his leadership. But Labor could go along if Likud
offered equal control of the government and a rotation in prime
ministers, as was the case during the last government.
   The latest developments reflect, in part, the enormous influence
of the international Jewish community. Jewish leaders from America,
Canada and Europe have lobbied Shamir not to go through with a
coalition agreement with ultra-Orthodox parties if it involves
controversial concessions on religious matters.
   Shamir had three of four Orthodox parties on his side until
recently, but their support was contingent on a promise that he back
passage of a law narrowing the definition of a Jew.
   The proposed ``Who is a Jew'' amendment to the Law of Return
would deny automatic immigration to Israel to Jews not converted by
Orthodox rabbis. The majority of Jews in the United States are
Reform and Conservative, and they see the proposed change as a
threat to their legitimacy.
   Labor did not make any clear-cut concessions to Agudat Israel in
the agreement signed Thursday, but Peres said the proposal to amend
the conversion law would be presented to the party's central
committee.
   The religious bloc controls 18 seats in the parliament, with
small leftist, right-wing and Arab parties controlling the others.

   A new survey of high school students has found
that many teen-agers are misinformed about AIDS and more than a few
are at risk themselves for the deadly disease, a federal agency said
Thursday.
   According to the survey, many high school students mistakenly
believe AIDS can be transmitted by mosquito bites, toilets and
giving blood.
   The national Centers for Disease Control and local school
officials surveyed students in ninth through 12th grades last spring
about their knowledge of AIDS and their own personal risks. The
surveys were conducted in eight states as well as in seven big-city
school systems.
   Some of the findings were surprising, said Dr. Laura Kann, a
researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC.
   ``They clearly know the primary sources of HIV (AIDS virus)
transmission, but when it does come to things like blood donations
... mosquitoes and public toilets, there are a whole lot of
misconceptions,'' she said.
   Findings did not differ greatly between locations, and
misinformation was widespread. For example, more than 70 percent of
the students responding in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans and New
York believed _ wrongly _ that someone can be infected with AIDS by
giving blood.
   While some people have been infected through receiving blood
tranfusions, particularly before the advent of testing blood for
exposure to the AIDS virus, contracting AIDS while routinely giving
blood is impossible since other people's blood does not come in
contact with a blood donor.
   In another example, more than half the students responding in Los
Angeles and New Orleans believed _ wrongly _ that AIDS can be
contracted by using a public toilet. And more than 70 percent of
those responding in Los Angeles mistakenly believed that AIDS is
transmitted through insect bites.
   Health officials say toilets and insects are not vehicles of AIDS
transmission.
   On the other hand, at least 84 percent of all the students
responding knew that sharing drug needles can spread AIDS, and at
least 88 percent knew they could get AIDS through sexual intercourse.
   Students in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and the states of
Michigan and California were asked about their personal experiences
with injectable drugs and sexual intercourse.
   Drug use was relatively low, ranging from 3 percent of the
Michigan students to 6 percent of those in Washington.
   Sexual intercourse was much more common, with the percentage of
students who had ever had sex ranging from 29 percent in San
Francisco to 76 percent in Washington. For male Washington students,
91 percent reported they'd had sex.
   The CDC urged education officials to ``implement programs to
correct misperceptions about HIV transmission to reduce behaviors
resulting in HIV infection.''
   The student surveys were not an attempt at a national poll, but
were spot surveys in selected cities and states with high incidence
of AIDS.
   The surveys were conducted in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans,
New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and the
states of California, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington.
   The CDC cautioned that response rates differed between locations,
so direct comparison of the findings from site to site, or attempts
to add them into a general total, could be misleading.
   But in general, the CDC noted, AIDS-related ``beliefs, knowledge
and behaviors among the adolescents surveyed ... are generally
similar.''

   A Malaysian prince married an
American Thursday after she converted to Islam.
   Crown Prince Tengku Idris Shah, 43, of western Selangor state,
married Nurlisa Idris Abdullah in a simple ceremony at Bukit
Kayangan Palace in Shah Alam, 18 miles west of the Malaysian
capital. Both wore white Malay costumes.
   Nurlisa, 28, formerly Lisa Davi, on Monday converted to the
Moslem faith and acquired the Moslem name.
   Selangor state Mufti (Moslem priest) Ishak Baharum led the
wedding ceremony in the presence of 150 guests who included Tengku's
father Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, his mother Tengku Ampuan and other
members of the royal family.
   Nurlisa's mother, Bernice Davi, who arrived from San Francisco
this week, also attended with a friend of her daughter, Elena
Ronald. The Americans' hometowns were not immediately available.
   A dowry of $30 was in the form 80 one-ringgit coins worth 37
cents each, wrapped in laced-fabric in a carved wooden container. A
diamond ring, beetle leaves, scented flower and a make-up set also
were presented in four containers.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and members of royal families
from other Malaysian states were among the 200 people who attended
the wedding feast at the palace Thursday night.
   Tengku Idris met Nurlisa several years ago while in the United
States.
   The marriage is the second for the Tengku Idris, who had two
daughters with Raja Zarina Raja Zainal before they divorced in
January last year.

   Four sailors have pleaded guilty to hiding an
Irish stowaway aboard a destroyer in a trans-Atlantic voyage that
prompted the Navy to tighten security aboard ships.
   An investigation showed Suzanne Twomey of Cork, Ireland, could
not have hidden aboard the USS Conyngham during a 10-day trip to
Virginia without inside help, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a spokesman
for the Atlantic Fleet Surface Force.
   ``The only thing that resulted from the incident was heightened
security awareness for ships that are taking visitors aboard
overseas,'' he said.
   Crewmen have been told to keep an eye on visitors to make sure
they leave, Lloyd said.
   Ms. Twomey, 17, was discovered in a small storage compartment a
day before the ship reached port. She was flown back to Ireland
after the ship docked.
   Seaman Apprentice David G. Peters, who authorities said invited
Ms. Twomey aboard ship and falsified a log to show she had left,
pleaded guilty at a court-martial Monday to hiding an illegal alien
and aiding her entry into the United States, Lloyd said.
   Peters was sentenced to the 70 days he had served in the brig. He
also received a bad-conduct discharge, which was suspended
contingent on his good behavior for 12 months.
   Seaman Apprentice Paul D. Davidson was sentenced on similar
charges to 30 days in the brig and ordered to forfeit two-thirds of
his pay for a month. He served four days before trial and has
returned to the brig to serve his remaining time, Lloyd said.
   Charges against Gunners Mate 3rd Class Donald L. Nichols and
Seaman Anthony M. Drady were reduced to offenses that were heard
before a captain's mast, a form of non-judicial punishment. The
federal Privacy Act bars disclosure of the punishment, Lloyd said.
   Four other sailors implicated in the incident were given
undisclosed punishment at a captain's mast last summer.
   All of the men remain assigned to the ship, Lloyd said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday met with a U.S.
archbishop who had been punished by the Vatican for permitting
homosexual gatherings and for other liberal practices objectionable
to the Holy See.
   Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen came to Rome to fulfill the
requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years and
report on their dioceses.
   The Vatican's official bulletin listed the meeting without
comment. Hunthausen could be not be reached for comment about his
meeting with the pope.
   In 1985, the Vatican removed Hunthausen's authority in several
major areas, after accusing him of being loose in granting marriage
annulments and general absolution for sins as well as of allowing
homosexuals to gather in church facilities.
   His authority was restored in 1987 and a coadjutor archbishop,
Thomas Murphy, was named. While the disciplinary action was in
force, an auxiliary bishop, Donald Wuerl, was assigned to wield the
authority in those areas.
   While under discipline, Hunthausen denounced the split-authority
arrangement as unworkable and humiliating. U.S. bishops, often at
odds with the Vatican on such issues as sexuality, expressed dismay
over the case.
   After Hunthausen's authority was restored, a three-member
commission was appointed to work out remaining problems in the
archdiocese.

<HEAD>Leading Index Inched Upward in October, But Sluggish Economy Seen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department on Thursday said the
Index of Leading Indicators, the government's main gauge of future
economic activity, edged up a slight 0.1 percent in October after
falling the previous month, signaling some sluggishness in growth by
the end of next year.
   But analysts said the moderation, which would be welcomed by
financial markets worried about inflation, isn't evident yet. And
they cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the index
establishes a consistent pattern.
   The index now has declined in five of the past 12 months. It
dropped a revised 0.3 percent in September, a bit more sharply than
the previous estimate of minus 0.1 percent. It also fell in July and
May, but rose in June and August.
   Michael Penzer, senior economist with Bank of America in San
Francisco, said the index since early 1987 has been underestimating
future growth. Nevertheless, he said the economy probably will slow
by next spring.
   Growth, as measured by the gross national product, averaged a 3
percent annual rate through the first nine months of this year, even
though the Federal Reserve Board from late March to early August
pushed up interest rates, hoping to curb GNP expansion to a
non-inflationary 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
   ``The Fed has been tightening in order to slow the rate of growth
down,'' Penzer said. ``Many times in the past they have overshot and
pushed the country into a recession, but this time they'll probably
luck out.''
   That would put the economy well into the middle of its seventh
year of expansion, a peacetime record.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latest
economic figures ``continue to suggest slower but continued economic
growth in the months ahead. ... It looks very good.''
   However, at least for October, the latest month available,
economic statistics portray stronger growth than desired by the Fed.
Unemployment is at a 14-year low, use of factory capacity is at an
8{-year high and personal income posted the biggest gain in a year.
   In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said
construction activity climbed 0.9 percent in October to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion, the fourth consecutive
monthly increase.
   Economists and the markets are now awaiting the release Friday of
the Labor Department's employment survey for an indication about
whether October's vigor continued into November.
   In October, four of nine available leading indicators were
pointing to faster growth, while five were pointing to slower growth.
   The factors pushing the index up, in order of magnitude, were an
increase in building permits, a rise in stock prices, a jump in new
orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial
claims for state unemployment insurance.
   The negative factors, ordered from largest to smallest, were
faster deliveries to companies, a sign of slackening demand; a drop
in the price of industrial materials; a decline in the
inflation-adjusted money supply; a shortening in the length of the
average workweek; and a fall in orders for business equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 193.0 percent of its 1967
base of 100, up only 0.5 percent from October 1987, compared with a
6 percent gain during the previous 12-month period.
   Maury N. Harris, chief economist of PaineWebber Inc., said the
two strongest positive factors _ building permits and stock prices _
likely will turn negative when the government calculates the
November index.
   ``There's nothing there that signals recession, but there's a lot
that signals slower growth,'' he said.
   Economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the
index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly
predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row. It
also has falsely predicted a recession four times.
   Preliminary estimates of the index often are revised
substantially in later months. For instance, declines were reported
initially for five consecutive months _ from September 1987 through
January _ but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops.
   In an attempt to improve the accuracy of the index, the
department said Thursday it was dropping two of the indicators:
changes in business and consumer credit, and changes in
manufacturing and trade inventories.
   Effective with the report for January, it will add a survey of
consumer expectations and changes in unfilled orders to durable
goods manufacturers.

<HEAD>Reagan Rules Out Pre-Trial Pardon for North</HEAD>

   President Reagan today ruled out a pre-trial
pardon for Iran-Contra defendant Oliver L. North, saying such a
pardon would leave his former White House aide ``under a shadow of
guilt.''
   At the same time, Reagan said his decision to suppress certain
evidence in the case was vital to protect ``national security
secrets.''
   The White House said earlier today that documents sought by North
contain intelligence secrets that cannot be divulged. It said it is
``up to the judge'' to decide whether to dismiss the charges against
the Marine lieutenant colonel if the classified material is relevant
to his defense.
   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with
President-elect George Bush and special trade representative Clayton
Yeutter at his side, Reagan was asked to say why he was blocking the
use of certain evidence in North's trial.
   ``The things we're blocking are things that duty requires we
block,'' Reagan replied. ``These are things that are national
security secrets.''
   Asked whether this amounted to an attempt to, in effect, sabotage
North's trial, he said, ``No, this is something that from the very
beginning we knew we would have to do.''
   Asked if he would be upset if the White House move had the effect
of preventing North's prosecution, Reagan said ``the law must take
its course.''
   Reagan, who told reporters last May that he thought both North
and Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter eventually would be found innocent,
was asked if he still believes that.
   ``Well at this stage, I don't think I should comment on guilt or
innocence or anything of this kind,'' he said. ``I think the law has
got to take its course.''
   Reagan then was asked whether he was considering a pardon for
North.
   ``From the very beginning, I have said that to consider a pardon
... even if I did that ... would leave them under a shadow of guilt
for the rest of their lives,'' he said. ``I think we have to let the
judicial process proceed.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the heads of U.S.
intelligence agencies, acting under authority of a law giving them
power to restrict classified material, notified Independent Counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh in July that the material could not be disclosed.
   He said Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci, CIA Director William Webster, national security
adviser Colin L. Powell and the head of the National Security
Agency, Lt. Gen. William Odom, made the unanimous determination.
   Fitzwater said Walsh did not object to the determination and
apparently believes his case can go forward with declassified
information that has been provided him. He said Walsh had been
briefed on the information and had access to it in classified form.
   However, he said, ``these secrets which cannot be disclosed have
been identified ... as material to the defense and it is up to the
judge to determine whether it is relevant.''
   ``If it is, it is up to him to decide what happens to the various
counts of the indictment.''
   Fitzwater said the White House, acting through the independent
counsel, has offered to brief U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell,
but has not received a response.
   He said the information involves ``secrets of the highest order''
involving intelligence ``activities and programs.''
   ``We are talking about much more than the identities of
countries, the identities of foreign leaders, although that
information is also classified in many cases,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said that a week and a half ago, when Gesell made
statements from the bench cautioning the White House that he would
have little control over the flow of information once the trial
began, possibly in late January, White House officials concluded
that the judge was not aware of the actions they had taken in July.
   He said White House Counsel A.B. Culvahouse wrote a letter to
Walsh during the last week and Walsh filed a pleading with the court
outlining the administration's position.
   While Gesell has the power to say whether or not the trial may
proceed on each of the counts against North and the other
defendants, the decision of what material may be used as evidence is
up to the White House.
   The White House position was made known as closed hearings began
on some of the classified documents in the case.
   Gesell conducted the hearing to consider the former presidential
aide's objections to deleting sensitive references from 350
classified documents that Walsh wants to use as evidence.
   North objects to virtually all of the proposed deletions, arguing
the references to countries, foreign officials and U.S. intelligence
agents are necessary to defend charges that he conspired to divert
more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Walsh, who attended Wednesday's hearing with several associate
prosecutors, contends that the former National Security Council aide
is trying to force authorities to scuttle the case rather than
disclose some of the nation's best-kept intelligence secrets.
   Walsh earlier had received permission from the Reagan
administration to use the 350 documents that contain 1,000 to 2,000
pages of classified material provided the sensitive references are
deleted.
   North also wants permission to disclose 40,000 pages of
classified material during the trial.
   Even if Reagan refuses to allow disclosure of secrets Gesell
determines are needed by the defense, North could still be
prosecuted on charges he made false statemnts to Congress and
conspired to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money
for the Contras.
   Those charges are less dependent on classified evidence, which
North wants to use to show he was acting with presidential authority
when he covertly helped the Contras raise money and diverted
proceeds from the arms-for-hostage deals in the Middle East to the
rebels.
   Decisions on classified documents would have a direct impact,
however, on Walsh's ability to prosecute North's co-defendants:
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   They are to be tried separately after North.

   What was believed to be a gathering of
Ku Klux Klan followers over the Thanksgiving holiday was actually a
group of youngsters ``playing Klan,'' police say.
   Landowner Tom Alan told police he saw several truckloads of young
men leave a wooded area Saturday after he was confronted by a gunman.
   Police found a camp decorated with red swastikas and a large
banner reading ``Welcome Klansmen.''
   ``These guys were just playing. It got out of hand. It scared one
of the neighbors and it scared some of the participants,'' said
police Sgt. Steve Weintraub.
   He said police have identified eight people who were in the camp
but could not confirm that anyone had a gun.
   Although the area is posted with no-trespassing signs, it has
been a popular hangout for neighborhood youths for years. No one has
been charged with trespassing, Weintraub said.

   The wrong man spent 11 years in prison for the
murder of a police officer, his former accuser said as he recanted
his testimony in a dramatic real-life epilogue to the documentary
movie ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``I feel like it's my responsibility to step forward _ to be a
man _ and admit my part in it,'' said David Ray Harris, who at age
16 testified in 1977 that Randall Dale Adams killed Dallas police
officer Robert Wood.
   Harris, now a death row inmate in an unrelated killing, was the
first witness to testify Wednesday in a state district court hearing
in which Adams is seeking a new trial.
   Adams was convicted of the Nov. 28, 1976, shooting death of Wood,
and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life in
prison. He has maintained his innocence, and ``The Thin Blue Line,''
a Public Broadcasting Service production released to selected
theaters this summer, questioned his conviction.
   In testimony today, a woman who told the trial judge that it was
Adams she saw at the scene of the killing said she didn't understand
the judge's question. Emily Blocker was questioned by Adams' lawyer
about the discrepancy between her testimony and her statement in the
movie, when she said she failed to pick Adams out of a lineup.
   ``Did you lie to the judge?'' asked defense attorney Randy
Schaffer.
   Ms. Blocker replied, ``I guess I didn't understand the (judge's)
question.''
   But she also testified that filmmaker Errol Morris coached her in
the movie.
   ``This man came into my house and told me he was going to make a
movie about a police shooting in Dallas. I said I don't exactly
remember how everything went down. He said, `What the heck? It's
just a movie. Anything you don't remember, I'll remember for you,'''
Ms. Blocker said.
   Morris, who was in the courtroom, told reporters that Ms. Blocker
was not coached and that she ``has no credibility whatsoever.''
   In his testimony Wednesday, Harris said that he was alone in the
car when the officer was killed, contradicting his original story
that he and Adams were in a car stopped by Wood and Officer Teresa
Turko.
   Although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder,
Harris said his finger was on the trigger of the .22-caliber gun
that killed Wood.
   Judge Larry Baraka said based on the testimony, he would
determine that Harris had admitted to committing the crime.
   ``As far as the court is concerned, he is telling me that he
did,'' Baraka said.
   Baraka could make a recommendation to the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals for a new trial after the hearing, which was expected to
last several days.
   Schaffer quickly got to the heart of the case, however, asking
Harris, ``Did Randall Adams kill Robert Wood?''
   Harris replied, ``No, he did not. Randall Adams knew nothing
about this offense and was not in the car at the time.''
   Dressed in an orange jail suit and wearing handcuffs and
shackles, Harris also denied assertions that he recanted to avoid a
reputation among other inmates as a ``snitch.''
   ``Someone might come up and stab me in the back tomorrow. So be
it,'' Harris said.
   Dallas County prosecutor Leslie McFarlane asked Harris why he
started making stronger statements to reporters in the past two or
three months about Adams' innocence compared to what he said in a
similar hearing for Adams in federal court in 1986.
   ``I felt like I needed to do something to push things forward
because evidently what I told them wasn't enough,'' Harris said.
   Harris testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution when
he implicated Adams at the trial. He said then-prosecutor Doug
Mulder had promised ``to take care of'' other criminal charges
pending against him in return for his testimony.
   After he testified against Adams, Harris said, he was not
prosecuted in those pending cases and did not have to continue
reporting to his probation officer.
   In initial reports, Turko, the policewoman whose partner was
slain, did not give a description of the gunman, but testified
Wednesday that she later described him as having bushy hair. She
acknowledged that she did not know where that description came from,
and she may have gotten it from Mulder.
   Schaffer asked if others in the police department were pushing to
solve Wood's murder.
   ``I wanted to see the man accused of killing my partner
convicted,'' Turko said.
   Among spectators in the packed courtroom Wednesday was Wood's
younger sister, Patricia Willis, who said she wants to see the
matter put to rest. Ms. Willis said she believes Harris has recanted
for attention and to bide time for himself.
   Morris said: ``I'm concerned because I want Randall Adams to get
out of jail. I care deeply about him and his family.''

   Benazir Bhutto became the first woman
to lead a Moslem nation when the president chose her Thursday to be
prime minister, the post her father held when he was deposed and
hanged a decade ago.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said in a televised address that Ms.
Bhutto had ``the best qualities of leadership and foresight as a
statesman.''
   Thousands of supporters celebrated in streets of the nation's
cities after the long-awaited announcement. They danced, beat drums
and chanted ``Long live Benazir!''
   Ms. Bhutto's party gained 12 more seats in the National Assembly
when it voted Wednesday on candidates to fill 20 seats reserved for
women.
   With those her populist Pakistan People's Party won in the Nov.
16 election, it holds 105 of the chamber's 237 seats, and she is
said to have enough support among minor parties and independents for
a majority coalition.
   President Reagan sent a letter of congratulations expressing
``his hope that the recently conducted elections will usher in an
era of democratic rule in Pakistan,'' a close ally of the United
States, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington.
   ``We are encouraged by this renewed commitment in Pakistan to
constitutional procedures and look forward to continuing our close
relations with Pakistan's new government,'' Fitzwater said.
   Zulfikar Ali Bhutto founded the Pakistan People's Party. In 1977,
after a landslide victory in the last previous free election, Gen.
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq ousted him in a coup.
   Bhutto was convicted of complicity in a political murder
conspiracy and hanged in 1979. Zia was killed in plane crash Aug. 17
after the election date had been set.
   An eight-party grouping called the Islamic Democratic Alliance,
which included Zia loyalists, won only 60 seats in the election and
Wednesday's assembly vote.
   Ishaq Khan, the 73-year-old Senate chairman who replaced Zia as
president, said Thursday he was convinced Ms. Bhutto could command a
majority in the National Assembly.
   He also declared the end of a state of emergency imposed after
Zia's death ``so the new prime minister can take up her
responsibility in an environment of complete democracy.''
   The president said he had received the resignations of the
caretaker government effective Friday, when Ms. Bhutto, 35, was to
take the oath of office.
   She was in Rawalpindi, adjacent to the federal capital of
Islamabad, and declined to speak with reporters. Party aides said
she was in her temporary quarters at the government guest house
conferring with political allies and did not watch Ishaq Khan's
address.
   Cars, motorcycles and scooters flying the red, green and black
party flag honked their horns in the crowded streets of Islamabad
and Rawalpindi.
   In Karachi, Ms. Bhutto's home city, tens of thousands of
celebrants jammed the streets of the working-class Lyari
neighborhood Wednesday night.
   An elderly woman who identified herself as Amina Bibi said
``Thank God'' Ms. Bhutto was appointed, and added: ``She went
through the mill.''
   In his television address _ delivered in Urdu, Pakistan's
official language _ Ishaq Khan called the new prime minister ``a
sound, educated, civilized, cultured and talented lady.''
   ``She has the best qualities of leadership and foresight of a
statesman,'' he said. ``She has the country's love in her heart.''
   He congratulated her as ``the choice of the people.''
   Pakistan officially returned to democracy when the National
Assembly and the four provincial legislatures were sworn in
Wednesday.
   Benazir Bhutto vowed during years of detention and living abroad
to force Zia from power. The general ruled for eight years under
martial law and the last three with a civilian government given
limited powers.
   Zia had declared that political parties could not participate in
the November elections, the same rule he applied for an election in
1985, but after his death the Supreme Court overruled him.

<HEAD>Government Sues Over Nuclear Power Plant Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday sued
Westinghouse Electric Corp. to cancel a contract for a nuclear plant
it says is unsafe and built after bribes were paid to an associate
of ex-President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Officials of the U.S. company said the Philippine government is
anti-nuclear and filed the suit for political reasons.
   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez announced the 75-page suit was
filed in the U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., against
Westinghouse, its subsidiary Westinghouse International Projects
Inc., and the contractors, Burns and Roe Enterprises Inc.
   Westinghouse said Thursday that it petitioned the International
Chamber of Commerce in Paris to arbitrate the dispute as provided by
the 1976 contract.
   The $2.3 billion power plant, on the Bataan peninsula about 60
miles west of the capital across Manila Bay, was completed three
years ago in the final months of Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Closing the Bataan plant was one of President Corazon Aquino's
campaign pledges during the 1986 presidential election against
Marcos. She charged the plant was unsafe and built on an earthquake
fault.
   Mrs. Aquino, who ousted Marcos in a civilian-backed military
uprising in February 1986, ordered the 620-megawatt plant closed
before it went into operation.
   In a statement released Thursday, Mrs. Aquino said the government
decided to file suit because the contractors ``were not willing to
agree to a fair commercial settlement.''
   Ordonez said Mrs. Aquino has not decided whether to suspend
interest payments on construction loans pending completion of
litigation. The loans cost the debt-strapped government about
$355,000 a day.
   A copy of the suit received by the Associated Press stated
Westinghouse paid some $17.3 million in ``kickbacks'' or commissions
to two companies owned by Herminio Disini, who is married to a
cousin of Marcos' wife, Imelda.
   It also alleged that sub-contracts for the building of the plant
went to companies owned by Disini. Officials say they suspect some
of the money went to Marcos.
   The suit is aimed at voiding the contract and forcing the giant
American company to return at least part of the money the
Philippines paid for the plant.
   ``The principal objective is to declare that there was bribery in
contracting this project,'' Ordonez said of the lawsuit. ``It is not
a politically motivated move. It is one that is calculated to obtain
release for the Philippines, which has been victimized by an illegal
transaction.''
   The Pittsburg-based Westinghouse has denied impropriety in
payments to Disini, saying the compensation complied with Philippine
regulations.
   Nathaniel D. Woodson, general manager of the Westinghouse nuclear
fuels unit, and Louis J. Briskman, Westinghouse deputy general
counsel, said Philippine officials have acknowledged during private
talks that no matter how safe the plant is, they don't intend to
allow nuclear power production in the country.
   ``It has nothing to do with safety,'' Woodson said. ``What we're
finding here are the results of a political policy that came to life
when they were running for office,'' Woodson said. ``They now feel
they have a political albatross around their neck and they're trying
to blame us.''
   ``Westinghouse will not be a scapegoat,'' he added.
   Sen. Rene Saguisag, who was involved in efforts to seek an
out-of-court settlement, said Marcos was not named in the suit to
avoid complicating cases pending in the Philippines and the United
States against the former president.
   Marcos and his wife, who live in Hawaii, were indicted by a
federal grand jury in October on racketeering charges. Marcos has
been named in 35 civil suits in the Philippines.

   The results of the November television rating
sweeps period indicates that, among the three networks, CBS took the
worst hit from the summer writers' strike.
   ``The strike really hurt CBS,'' said David Poltrack, CBS vice
president for marketing. ``We didn't have any big events to fill
in'' such as ABC's 18-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance.''
   He said CBS also had fewer established half-hour sitcoms than the
competition. Those shows got back into production quicker than hour
dramas.
   ABC was the only one of the three networks to show a rise in
ratings this November compared to last November, when it came in
third in the sweeps. Its ``Roseanne'' was the highest-rated new
series in November.
   CBS and ABC tied for second in terms of regular series
programming, according to CBS' analysis of the A.C. Nielsen Co.
numbers. But ABC had a three-point lead on CBS when it came to
miniseries and movies.
   NBC, with five of the top 10 series and the five top-rated
movies, handily won the sweeps, one of four months a year when
network affiliates' ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating
local advertising rates.
   NBC had an average, prime-time rating of 15.4. ABC had an average
rating of 14.0 and CBS 12.0. Each rating point represents 904,000
households with televisions.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was the highest-rated network show with a
rating of 26.3, down from the 32.3 the show got in November 1987. In
fact, all the top-rated series suffered ratings declines.
   Because of strike-caused production delays on its regular series,
ABC rushed to the air with the first part of its more than 30-hour
``War and Remembrance,'' a sequel to ``The Winds of War.'' Except
for two two-part movies, ``War and Remembrance'' was the only
miniseries of the November sweeps. It ended with a disappointing
18.6 rating and 29 share, but was good enough to save ABC from third
place in the sweeps. ABC will run the remainder of the miniseries
next May, said spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer.
   Sweeps programming brought more viewers to their sets. More
households used television, but 3 percent fewer sets were tuned to
networks. That was an improvement, though, on the season-to-date 6
percent decline in network viewing. And some of the November decline
was attributable to low network viewing on election night.
   One of the most significant numbers was the increase in viewing
of independent stations, which have become more aggressive during
sweeps periods.
   Fox Broadcasting Co., whose affiliates are counted as independent
stations, experienced a dramatic rise in ratings, an average 5.5
compared to 3.7 a year ago. Part of that increase was because Fox
was running new episodes of its most popular programs, ``America's
Most Wanted'' and ``Married ... With Children'' during the summer
when the networks were in repeats. Those shows apparently developed
a following that stuck with them in the fall when the networks were
struggling to get delayed shows on the air.
   But independent stations also did well by taking over what was
previously a network source of programming _ theatrical release
movies. The networks have all but abandoned theatrical movies as a
source of ratings, Poltrack said. Meanwhile, independent stations
are able to garner competitive ratings by running such films as ``48
Hours'' and ``The Godfather.''
   Pay cable also experienced an increase in viewership during the
sweeps. HBO was up to an average rating of 8.3, compared to 6.9 a
year ago. That was the first increase for HBO in the five years
since the networks began analyzing pay cable performance during
sweeps.
   Poltrack predicted that January will be ``critical'' for the
networks, because it will be their first chance in the
strike-delayed season to recoup regular series viewers.
   ``We look to the future, not to the past,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Breaks Link Between Computer Systems After `Hacker'
Invades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department severed the electronic
links between two of its computer networks early this week after an
unknown ``hacker'' illegally gained entry to a contractor's
computer, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data
or information, but the links between the two were ``temporarily
severed ... in order to provide a barrier to protect users,'' the
department said in a statement.
   The connections between the Arpanet network, which links academic
and corporate computer centers and which was attacked by a ``virus''
last month, and the so-called Milnet system, which links thousands
of military computers, were severed Monday.
   The Pentagon said the connection was broken after ``an
unidentified hacker penetrated a VAX computer belonging to a defense
contractor on the night of Nov. 27-28, 1988.''
   ``The hacker used a weakness in the end user's computer software.
The `fix' for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is
available electronically to users of the software,'' the Pentagon
said.
   Amateur computer users who try to make unauthorized entry into
computer systems or networks are known as hackers.
   The Pentagon did not identify the contractor, but a spokeswoman
for the Mitre Corp. in Bedford, Mass., Marcia Cohen, said one of the
company's computers had been entered.
   The connections between Arpanet and Milnet were expected to be
restored Thursday. The two networks are connected at seven
electronic gateways around the country.
   ``The contractor's programmers have taken corrective measures to
prevent any recurrence,'' the Pentagon added.
   Arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that was
crippled last month when someone slipped a ``virus'' into the system
_ an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Syracuse.
   The virus, a self-copying program which can cripple computer
operations by soaking up capacity or destroying data, jammed an
estimated 6,000 computers nationwide. The virus attack caused at
least $97 million in damage because of interrupted work and the need
to cleanse the computers, according to the Computer Virus Industry
Association.
   Authorities believe the virus program was created by Cornell
University graduate student Robert Morris Jr., 23, of Arnold, Md.
   FBI agents in Massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people at
Harvard University, where Morris was a computer science
undergraduate until June. Two Harvard computer experts, graduate
student Paul Graham and computer programmer Andrew H. Suddeth,
appeared before the grand jury Wednesday.
   Suddeth has said Morris called him in a panic for help in getting
out a message to other computer operators after Morris realized what
the virus was doing.
   The third person subpoenaed, Mark Friedell, an associate
professor of computer science, was excused from testifying. He said
he told prosecutors he knew nothing of the allegations of Morris'
involvement with the virus.
   Morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before the panel, his
lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni of Washington, told the Syracuse
Herald-Journal.
   Guidoboni so far has advised Morris not to talk with anyone about
the virus, including FBI agents. But the lawyer said an agreement
may soon be reached in which an interview with agents would be
arranged.

<TEXT>
   Nevada officials have listed former Las
Vegas casino executive Frank ``Lefty'' Rosenthal in the state's
``black book'' of people barred from casinos.
   Rosenthal said he wasn't surprised by the unanimous Nevada Gaming
Commission decision, but said he will fight it.
   Commission Chairman John O'Reilly ended an eight-hour hearing
Wednesday by saying his main concern was Rosenthal's ``notorious and
unsavory'' reputation over the years.
   During the hearing, Rosenthal, 59, said politics rather than his
reputation created problems for him in Nevada during the 1970s. ``I
know people in the gaming industry today who make me look like a
choir boy, frankly,'' he said.
   Rosenthal said another reason for his trouble with authorities
over the years was his reputation as an expert bookmaker _ something
that was viewed as ``less than desirable.''
   Rosenthal was an executive for Argent Corp., which ran four Las
Vegas casinos in the 1970s, before he left Las Vegas after an
attempt on his life in October 1982. He since has lived in
California and Florida.
   The state Gaming Commission ruled in 1976 that he was unsuitable
to work as a key employee with Argent because of alleged organized
crime ties. Rosenthal challenged the ruling all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court, but the high court let the Nevada decision stand.
   The FBI has linked Rosenthal to organized crime figures but he
never was charged with any crime.
   Rosenthal, a one-time Chicago hot dog stand owner, has denied
having ties to organized crime.

   Despite an apparent end to the jamming of most
Western radio broadcasts, the Soviet Union still is not entitled to
have a human rights conference in Moscow, the State Department said
Thursday.
   ``We will be looking for further Soviet movement on other
issues,'' department spokesowman Phyllis Oakley said.
   The jamming of American-financed Radio Liberty and two other
foreign radio stations ceased Wednesday. ``This is a positive
development which, if it becomes permament, will further contribute
to the improvement in East-West relations,'' the State Department
official said.
   But, she said, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria were continuing to jam
Radio Free Europe, which broadcasts to Eastern Europe. ``We urge
those two nations to end this practice, which conflicts with their
international obligations,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The Soviets long have been eager to hold an international human
rights conference in Moscow. One of the U.S. conditions was an end
to jamming Russian-language broadcasts.
   Mrs. Oakley said ``the end to jamming enhances the prospects for
a Moscow meeting.'' But the Soviets must make other improvements in
human rights and also provide ``credible guarantees'' that the
meeting would be open to all Soviet citizens, the U.S. official said.
   The Reagan administration also is demanding that curbs on
emigration be eased further.
   On a related subject, Mrs. Oakley said the State Department was
concerned with developments in the troubled Caucasus region where
the Soviets on Wednesday reported 11 new deaths and there was a
rising flood of refugees from ethnic violence.
   ``We deeply regret the loss of life there,'' she said. ``We hope
and expect that Soviet authorities will continue making every effort
to protect the lives and welfare of people in the region while
seeking a just and peaceful resolution.''

   Construction spending rose 0.9 percent in
October, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, with half of the
gain coming in single-family homes, the government said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said building activity rose $3.7 billion
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion. Strength was
widespread in most categories, but $1.9 billion of the gain came in
single-family homes, which jumped 1.6 percent to $118.5 billion.
   Construction spending, which rose 0.7 percent in September and
0.2 percent in August, recently has bucked what has been a generally
lackluster building trend over the past year.
   Even with the latest string of increases, building activity
advanced only 2.1 percent in the past 12 months. Taking a 1.7
percent rise in construction costs into account, activity advanced a
mere 0.4 percent over the period.
   For October, residential construction was up 1.0 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $198.9 billion. The gain in
single-family home building more than made up for a 1.4 percent
decrease in construction of multifamily units, which has been
sluggish since federal tax laws were changed effective at the start
of last year.
   ``A large portion of the single-family activity is in California
and Florida,'' said John Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group,
a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``It's easy to see why when
you look where people are moving to. California's population is
growing at an annual rate of 400,000, and 300,000 people a year are
moving to Florida.''
   Michael Moran, chief economist of Daiwa Securities America Inc.,
said he expects housing activity to taper off because interest rates
are rising and because much of the pent-up demand from the early
1980s, when interest rates soared, has been filled.
   Non-residential construction rose 0.4 percent in October,
climbing to an annual rate of $91.3 billion. While construction of
shopping centers and other commercial projects was off by 8.0
percent, construction of industrial projects jumped 7.9 percent;
hotels and motels, 6.9 percent; and office buildings, 3.0 percent.
   Construction of factories, despite a booming manufacturing
sector, has held relatively steady over the past year. Manufacturers
have preferred to invest in updated equipment, Moran said.
   ``There is some reluctance to build new factories because of
skepticism about how long the boom will last,'' he said.
   Government construction climbed 2.4 percent to an annual rate of
$80.9 billion, reflecting increased spending for schools, sewers and
roads. Highway construction, the largest government category, was up
7.9 percent in October to $25.9 billion.
   ``We're looking at a public highway system put together 25 to 30
years ago. Spending is going to have to stay strong because the darn
things are falling apart,'' Savacool said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Wins Near Unanimous Approval of Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won nearly unanimous
approval Thursday of a more dynamic political structure from a
parliament that voted its traditionally docile form out of existence.
   In a speech to the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev also
accepted blame for the lack of explanations that led to a remarkable
public debate over the reform he considers crucial to his
restructuring effort.
   Despite criticism from some of the 15 Soviet republics that the
reforms make Moscow too powerful, only five deputies voted against
it. Still, the negative votes were a rarity in the parliament that
for years has unanimously approved Kremlin directives. The first
``no'' votes came just more than a month ago.
   Gorbachev told deputies that except for an emergency, ``this
line-up of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet is having its final session.''
   Elections will be held March 26 for a new 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies that will choose from among its members a
smaller, more active Supreme Soviet.
   ``We are creating a new, very authoritative representative body
of power that will reflect all national, territorial and social
interests of society,'' Gorbachev said.
   The reform also creates a strong presidency in place of the
largely ceremonial post Gorbachev assumed Oct. 1.
   Earlier in the week, he said that without the political reform,
``The drive for perestroika inevitably will begin to skid.''
   He said in a speech Thursday concluding an extraordinary
three-day session on his proposals to restructure the government
that the revised constitution was temporary, and further changes
would respond to demands for expanded power for republic and local
governments.
   But he emphasized the rest of his reforms will be considered by
the new lawmakers.
   Gorbachev also told the deputies that a storm of controversy over
the reform package _ including 250,000 letters to the Kremlin _
could have been reduced, and he took the blame.
   ``We did not care about explaining the essence, the meaning'' of
the changes, Gorbachev said. ``The center was just following the old
practice, thinking, well, they would get used to it.''
   ``That is why I reiterate all of us are now learning our lessons.
All of us are in a school of democracy, and we should be good pupils
in that school,'' Gorbachev said.
   Newspapers first published the draft language of the complex
revisions in 117 articles of the constitution and election law only
five weeks ago. The changes were not explained at the time, nor was
it clear who wrote them.
   ``Many elements were not understood right away,'' Gorbachev
acknowledged.
   The vote on the constitutional changes was 657 in favor, 3
against and 26 abstentions in the Soviet of Nationalities, and 687
in favor, 2 against and 1 abstention in the Soviet of Unions.
   A companion package providing for multiple-candidate elections
was adopted unanimously by both houses.
   At least three of the negative votes on the constitutional
package came from Estonians, who complain that it shifts power from
the republics to Moscow.
   The Baltic republic had been an object of controversy during the
three-day Supreme Soviet session following its ``declaration of
sovereignty'' in internal affairs two weeks ago. That action was
rejected by the Kremlin as unconstitutional.
   It also establishes the Congress of People's Deputies, with
two-thirds of the representatives elected by the public and
one-third by organizations including the Communist Party and trade
unions.
   That provision provoked complaints that citizens who are members
of certain organizations will be able to vote more than once, and
perhaps hold more than one seat in the Congress.
   The congress will elect the president and the Supreme Soviet,
which changes from a part-time body summoned twice a year to ratify
the actions of its Presidium into a working legislature meeting
eight months a year. It will write laws and may veto the decisions
of its presidium and the president.
   A lone attempt at a revision on the floor Thursday was rejected
by a vote of 1,353 to 23. That was an amendment offered by a Latvian
delegate, Jemma Sculme, which effectively would have given the
republics veto power in the parliament.
   The leadership altered the reform package overnight Wednesday to
incorporate some suggestions from lawmakers, but alternate Politburo
member Georgy Razumovsky offered only sketchy information on the
changes before the vote was called. It was not clear if lawmakers
had copies of the final set of constitutional amendments before they
adopted them.
   The official press did not publish the amendments approved by the
Presidium on Saturday on the basis of the five-week public debate,
nor did it print the final amendments approved overnight Wednesday,
leaving many questions about what the final version contained.
   The Baltic republics had complained the original draft eliminated
their right to secede, and it was not clear whether this week's
changes solved that objection.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife pleaded
innocent Thursday to federal bribery and extortion charges stemming
from the Wedtech corruption scandal.
   Garcia, 55, his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, and a lawyer from
Puerto Rico, Ralph Vallone Jr., 41, were indicted last week for an
alleged conspiracy to obtain $185,000 in cash, interest-free loans
and jewelry from the Wedtech Corp.
   The indictment came just a few days after former U.S. Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., and four others were sentenced to prison for their
conviction in a Wedtech-related racketeering trial.
   Wedtech, a now-defunct South Bronx defense contractor, grew from
a small machine shop into a multimillion-dollar business through a
series of no-bid government contracts obtained through a federal
minority business program.
   But federal and state investigations uncovered a web of
corruption involving Wedtech payoffs extending from the Bronx to
Washington.
   The seven-count indictment accused Garcia, a Bronx Democrat, of
using his official position to demand and obtain payoffs from
Wedtech.
   Garcia, a congressman since 1978, is charged with extortion,
conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. His wife
faces similar charges.
   As they entered the courthouse, Garcia told reporters: ``I'm
innocent and when the moment comes, I'll be exonerated.''
   ``We're innocent and we'll prove it,'' his wife added.
   The Garcias and Vallone, who was not present at the arraignment,
face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of extortion.
   Vallone's attorney, Hal Meyerson, said afterward that his client
was in Puerto Rico with ``serious problems involving his throat.''
   U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon entered an innocent plea for Vallone
and released the Garcias without bail.
   ``I'm a congressman and will continue to be a congressman for the
district where I was born and raised,'' Garcia told reporters before
going off with his wife to be fingerprinted and photographed by
federal marshals.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand, who
set a trial date of June 1, 1989. A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for Jan. 3.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groups pushing for greater efforts against AIDS
urged President-elect George Bush on Thursday to help lead the fight
and to champion federal anti-discrimination laws to protect victims
of the deadly disease.
   The National Organization Responding to AIDS, a coalition of
groups, criticized President Reagan, who accepted only some of the
recommendations of his presidential commission on AIDS, refusing in
particular to embrace its call for anti-discrimination legislation.
   ``The silence from the White House and from the executive branch
has been overwhelming, and I think all of us are looking to a
dramatic change in that regard,'' Jeffrey Levi, head of the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force, told a news conference held on World
AIDS day. His group is part of the coalition.
   During the presidential campaign, Bush expressed his support for
legislation ``that would make it a crime to discriminate against
AIDS patients and those infected with the virus.'' He also said AIDS
test results must be kept ``appropriately confidential.''
   The coalition issued recommendations for his incoming
administration, including a call for greater funding of AIDS
research and for reforms in the health care financing system, as
well as anti-discrimination legislation and stronger leadership.
   ``The discussion about AIDS ... must be coming out of the mouth
of the president and out of the voice of the executive office,''
said Jean McGuire, chairman of the coalition.
   Members of the coalition met with the president-elect's
transition team on Wednesday to discuss their report, ``A Call for
Executive Action,'' and spoke briefly with Bush, who was visiting
his transition offices.
   Bush expressed his support for the coalition's efforts, Ms.
McGuire said.
   According to the coalition, the Health and Human Services
Department had proposed $1.9 billion for AIDS research for fiscal
1990 but the Reagan administration has cut the request to $1.6
billion.
   Officials at HHS referred questions about their budget request to
the Office of Management and Budget, where spokeswoman Barbara Clay
said the agency could not confirm any budget figures in the midst of
appeals.
   The coalition ``called on the Bush administration to amend the
budget,'' Levi said.
   ``They (the transition team) made clear that this was not their
budget, but they also did not make any commitments as to whether or
not they would be putting forward an amendment or making any
changes,'' Levi said.
   The coalition also urged the president-elect to support passage
of the Americans With Disabilities Act, a bill that would extend
specific civil rights protections to all people with disabilities,
including those with AIDS and those infected with HIV, the virus
believed to cause AIDS.
   The coalition is comprised of more than 90 groups, including the
American Medical Association, the National AIDS Network, the
American Bar Association, the National Association of Counties and
the Presbyterian Church USA.
   It was formed in 1987 to develop ``comprehensive, humane and
effective federal AIDS policy.''
   As of Nov. 28, AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, had
been diagnosed in 79,389 Americans, of whom more than half, or
44,590, had died since June 1, 1981, according to the Centers for
Disease Control.
   No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

prostate surgery the day before, Heflin's office said.
   A statement from Heflin's office said the 67-year-old senator was
resting comfortably with no complications after undergoing a
transurethral resection of the prostate. That is an operation
similar to the surgery President Reagan had in January 1987.
   Heflin's doctors found no evidence of cancer, the statement said,
and he was expected to be released from the hospital soon.

   Radio Liberty officials on Thursday
rejoiced over an end to 35 years of Kremlin-ordered broadcast
jamming as they examined how to take advantage of the newly cleared
air waves to the Soviet Union.
   ``This is a great challenge for us,'' said S. Enders Wimbush,
director of the U.S.-owned network based in Munich. ``It's caused
tremendous excitement around here, because they (radio employees)
see an opportunity they've long waited for.''
   Robert Redlich, spokesman for Radio Liberty and its sister
station Radio Free Europe, which beams its signal to Eastern
European countries, said news that the jamming stopped was broadcast
to listeners in the Soviet Union.
   ``This was very much in our news. We gave it good play,'' Redlich
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his Munich
office.
   The end of Soviet jamming against Radio Liberty appears to be
part of the glasnost, or ``openness,'' policy of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. The Soviets ceased jamming of the U.S.-operated Voice
of America service more than a year ago, and some East European
countries dropped efforts to block Radio Free Europe broadcasts.
   Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria continue to interrupt RFE service.
   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the end to jamming
of Radio Liberty.
   ``This is a positive development which, if it becomes permanent,
will further contribute to the improvement in East-West relations,''
said Phyllis Oakley, deputy spokeswoman.
   She urged Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria to end their jamming.
   The Helsinki Commission, a U.S. government panel set up in 1976
to monitor Soviet human rights, lauded the end to the jamming of
German and Israeli radio as well as Radio Liberty, whose signal was
distorted since it went on the air in 1953.
   ``This demonstrates a new seriousness on the part of the Soviet
regime in addressing its citizens' right to the freedom of
information,'' said the group, formally known as the Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Western broadcasts have kept Soviets and East Europeans informed
on such important historical events as the failed 1956 Hungarian
revolt, the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1986
Chernobyl disaster.
   Wimbush said a listener from the Soviet Union called the Radio
Liberty offices in Munich on Thursday and expressed astonishment the
programming was coming through without the usual interference.
   ``He had just turned the radio on and could hear us,'' he said.
   Wimbush plans to add more human interest stories to the broadcast.
   ``We're going to be reaching out for a younger audience and
report on topical matters that would interest young people, such as
AIDS, drug problems, relations between men and women _ the kind of
fare that you would likely find on Western radio,'' he said.
   Radio Liberty plans to set up a call-in system to talk with its
Soviet listeners and incorporate more music in its broadcasts.
   The Polish government this summer said that with new press
freedom in parts of the East bloc, Radio Free Europe and Radio
Liberty had no real purpose anymore.
   But network officials flatly reject those kinds of suggestions
and contend their efforts helped pave the way for glasnost.
   ``The Soviet media have made great strides,'' Wimbush said. ``But
they aren't always saying everything, and there are a lot of issues
they don't treat at all.''
   Wimbush also said that only a small minority of urban Soviets see
publications like Moscow News and Ogonyok, which have carried some
of the most surprising and controversial articles in the age of
glasnost.
   ``There is an enormous black hole in the countryside,'' Wimbush
said, noting that Radio Liberty can now reach rural residents.
   The Soviet Union began using radio waves to try to block Radio
Liberty's signals the same day the station opened for business in
March 1953, said Redlich.
   Despite efforts by officials to jam the broadcasts, some Soviet
citizens were able to pick up the service on short wave radios.
Jamming used to be concentrated on major cities, where most Soviet
intellectuals and dissents live.
   The Soviets this week stopped jamming Russian-language broadcasts
by Deutsche Welle, a West German broadcasting network.
   Kohl's spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, commented Thursday that the Bonn
leadership hopes the Soviet end to jamming expresses ``a beginning
of unhindered communication between East and West.''

<TEXT>
   A 32-year-old man who had drug and
weapons charges against him dropped when a prosecutor heard he had
drowned is not dead, and charges against him will be reinstated,
officials said.
   The 9th Circuit Solicitor's office had received word that William
Wilson III drowned in September in a James Island creek.
   Assistant Solicitor Mark C. Moore said charges of possession of
marijuana for distribution and possession of a firearm by a
convicted felon were dismissed Nov. 3 because of the belief that
Wilson had died.
   The confusion arose when a 31-year-old William Wilson of James
Island drowned while shrimping in September.
   Solicitor Charles Condon said the mistake occurred because an
employee in his office said she knew the man and that his name was
listed on court dockets.
   Moore said he asked the employee to confirm that by checking
court files. But the description of both Wilsons was similar in year
of birth, race and size, and both men had been charged with weapons
offenses.
   Moore said the staff believed that William Wilson III was the man
who drowned and the charges were dismissed.
   They learned their mistake when Wilson was stopped by police Nov.
25 and they found three bags of marijuana in his car.
   ``I never had anything like this happen,'' Condon said. ``I'm
grateful it was caught.''
   Condon said he will begin asking defense lawyers to supply death
certificates when their clients die before coming to trial. Moore
said he will attempt to indict Wilson on the April charges.

   The first World AIDS Day was marked Thursday by a concert in
Beijing, a march through the streets of Harare, Zimbabwe, and a
speech by a San Franciscan who has had the deadly disease for six
years and says his life was ``made richer'' because of it.
   The World Health Organization sponsored the event, aimed at
encouraging people to talk about the virus that infects an estimated
5 million to 10 million people worldwide.
   President Reagan, Pope John Paul II and U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar sent messages to the opening ceremony at the
agency's headquarters in Geneva, calling for stepped-up efforts
against the disease.
   ``It is the responsibility of each individual to learn about HIV
(the AIDS virus) and to treat those infected with HIV with respect
and compassion. And it is the responsibility of infected individuals
not to infect others,'' Reagan said in his message, which was read
by singer Pearl Bailey.
   The agency said 140 nations held special AIDS prevention
activities Thursday.
   In Zimbabwe's capital, more than 200 young men and women marched
through the city center with placards saying, ``We have the power to
stop the spread of AIDS.''
   In Lusaka, the capital of neighboring Zambia, hundreds watched
plays and films about the dangers of AIDS.
   China held a nationally televised lecture on AIDS and a concert
in Beijing to benefit an AIDS foundation and the Public Health
Ministry.
   Groups distributed free condoms at Gatwick Airport outside
London. In Stockholm, Sweden, 2,000 scientists called for an end to
discrimination against AIDS victims.
   About 200 posters bearing witness to the suffering of AIDS
victims and their loved ones were displayed on Paris' esplanade of
Human Rights at Trocadero.
   ``Thursday night, we will be there for you with your friends,''
one poster read. ``You fought until the end, we tried to help but we
lost ... My dear, where are you? We hope is it better than here on
Earth ... Love, Your Mama and Papa.''
   In the United States, New York's Times Square zipper flashed news
messages about AIDS prevention and Mayor Edward I. Koch planted the
first bulbs of a ``Hope Garden'' that authorities hope will grow a
flower for each person with the disease.
   A rally was staged in Albuquerque, N.M., a prayer breakfast was
held in Atlanta, and part of a quilt with 8,288 panels _ each
stitched with the name of an AIDS victim _ was displayed in Boston.
   In the Geneva ceremony, another speaker called World AIDS Day
``the opening paragraph in a new chapter of our worldwide effort to
stop AIDS.''
   Richard Rector, 32, said he has had the disease for six years,
during which he says he has traveled to three continents to teach
people about AIDS.
   ``I have gladly had my world turned upside down, and made
richer'' through having the disease, he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring. There is no known cure.
   Officially, 142 countries have reported 129,385 cases of AIDS to
the World Health Organization.
   But the agency estimates that the true number is more than twice
that, and that 5 million to 10 million people may be infected with
the HIV virus. Once infected with the virus, victims have a 50
percent chance of developing AIDS within 10 years.
   The focus of the WHO's AIDS prevention program is education and
information to fight the spread of the virus. It can be transmitted
through blood, sexual intercourse or from an infected mother to her
unborn or newborn child. People at high risk of infection include
those with multiple sex partners and intravenous drug users who
share needles.
   The pope's statement urged ``respect for all individuals'' and
said AIDS victims ``meet with my affection and are the subject of my
prayers.''
   In Washington, eight letters by people with AIDS were read at a
Department of Health and Human Services ceremony.
   ``I can't tell you my name because my short life of only 20 years
would be over very quickly,'' said one letter from an Alabama
college student. ``I sit in classrooms and hear people discuss AIDS
and what they think they know is right. Why can't I speak up and
tell them they can't get it from just being in the same room? Why
can't I tell them the truth?''

<HEAD>Dukakis to Meet With Democratic Leaders, Bentsen Before Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, the defeated Democratic
presidential nominee, will meet with his party's congressional
leaders and running mate Lloyd Bentsen before sitting down Friday
with President-elect George Bush, spokesmen for the Massachusetts
governor said Thursday.
   He also will hold a private meeting with Washington-based
campaign aides to thank them for their work in his unsuccessful
White House bid, Dukakis spokesman James Dorsey said.
   Dukakis was to arrive in Washington Friday morning and meet on
Capitol Hill with House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and new Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, Dorsey said.
   Also on the governor's agenda was a luncheon with Bentsen, the
Texas senator who Dukakis selected as his vice presidential nominee.
   Dukakis likely would ask the Democratic leaders if they had any
concerns they wanted relayed to Bush, Dorsey said.
   The afternoon meeting of the former presidential rivals, which
was requested by Bush, was to be held at the vice president's
residence. It comes a day after the president-elect met with
Mitchell and two days after he had lunch with Jesse Jackson, one of
the men Dukakis bested to win the Democratic nomination.
   Spokesman Steve Crawford said Dukakis planned to talk to Bush
about a number of issues he raised during the campaign.
   ``Education, health care, day care, drugs, housing and other
issues that he felt were important during the campaign and still
feels are important,'' Crawford said when asked to outline Dukakis'
agenda for the Bush meeting.
   Since the election Dukakis also has expressed concern over
reports quoting Bush transition aides as saying Medicare and other
entitlement programs could face spending cuts as part of a
deficit-reduction plan.

   Facts about the Radio Liberty and Radio
Free Europe broadcasting networks:
   _ The Munich-based Radio Free Europe network was founded in 1949.
Radio Liberty, an associated service for listeners in the Soviet
Union, was founded in 1951 and was once operated under the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency. It went on the air in 1953. The two
services were merged in 1976 and are now controlled by the
Washington-based Board for International Broadcasting and funded by
the U.S. government.
   _ Radio Liberty broadcasts news and commentary in Russian,
Byelorussian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kazak,
Uzbek, Kirghiz, Turkmenian, Tadzhik, Tatar-Bashkiri, Pashtu and Dari.
   _ Radio Free Europe broadcasts in Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Bulgarian, Czechoslovakia, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian.
   _ The sprawling, high-security compound encloses separate
newsrooms for each language service, as well as the networks'
reference library on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union used
frequently by American and Western scholars.
   _ The two radio networks employ about 1,700 worldwide.

   A Lithuanian immigrant who the Justice
Department claims helped murder Jews during World War II has agreed
to surrender his U.S. citizenship, but he will not be deported, an
official said.
   Under an agreement signed this week, Jonas Klimavicius, 81, will
provide evidence on other members of the Nazi paramilitary outfit
known as the Lithuanian Shutzmannschaft, Eli Rosenbaum, deputy
director of the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations, said Wednesday.
   That information is being used in two cases in Boston and in the
investigations of dozens of other members of Klimavicius' battalion,
he said.
   In the court agreement, Klimavicius admitted serving in the fall
of 1941 in the battalion, but did not admit taking part in what
Rosenbaum said were the persecutions of thousands of Jews and other
unarmed civilians. He also did not admit misrepresenting or
concealing facts about his past on his citizenship application.
   The Justice Department decided to drop its case because of
Klimavicius' age and the length of time it might take for hearings
and appeals to be conducted, Rosenbaum said.
   The agreement does not preclude Klimavicius' extradition to
another country to stand trial for alleged war crimes.
   U.S. District Judge Gene Carter signed the agreement Monday.
   Carter had earlier stripped Klimavicius of his citizenship
because he refused to testify about his past, but he was overturned
by the U.S. Circuit Court in Boston last July and a second
deportation hearing was ordered. That hearing was scheduled to begin
Dec. 12.
   Klimavicius came to the United States in 1949 via New York City
and became a U.S. citizen five years later. He lived on Long Island,
retiring from his job as a machinist in the early 1970s, and moved
to Maine in 1983.

<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche was
waited upon hand-and-foot by employees who cooked for him, his wife
and his dogs, bought his clothes, cleaned his house and performed
concerts for him, a federal jury heard Thursday.
   Pam Cowdery, a former employee of a LaRouche graphics company,
testified at LaRouche's conspiracy trial that she played the violin
and sang at his Leesburg, Va., estate when he and his wife ``just
wanted to hear some music.''
   She also said she cooked for the LaRouches, helped clean the
house and even prepared ``very special meals'' featuring boned
chicken breasts for the couple's dogs.
   LaRouche's security chief, Richard Magraw, testified that
LaRouche carried no money, and that he would buy suits, underwear,
tobacco and even haircuts for his balding boss.
   Prosecutors contend LaRouche was living this upscale life in
Virginia's horse country while LaRouche-controlled organizations
were failing to repay more than $30 million in loans from
individuals. A federal grand jury has charged LaRouche and six
associates on trial with him in U.S. District Court with conspiring
to defraud the lenders.
   LaRouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by failing to declare as income the household and
personal services he received from his organizations.
   Ms. Cowdery, who stopped working for LaRouche in 1986 but still
supports him politically, said that before 1984 LaRouche staffers
were encouraged to attend and perform in cultural events. But she
said the program suffered during LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign when a defendant in the case, William Wertz, took over
fund-raising operations and made staffers work longer hours.
   Ms. Cowdery said that when performers complained, LaRouche
replied, ``You have to understand that everything that Will does is
under my directions. I make the policy and Will just carries it
out.''
   She said LaRouche also commented that people in his organization
``had become more stupid.''
   Magraw, who is responsible for safety at LaRouche's house and for
his personal security, said he usually acted on his own to make
purchases for LaRouche and did not discuss them beforehand with his
boss.
   Asked how he would know the size of items such as trousers,
Magraw said, ``I took an old pair of trousers hanging in the closet
to the tailor and told him to make it the same length.''
   Under cross-examination from defense lawyers Magraw _ testifying
under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution _ described
LaRouche as a workaholic who never told his security detail to buy
any personal items.
   Magraw, referring to his purchase of suits for LaRouche, said,
``I bought them at odd times when they were on sale.''
   ``You were more concerned with his appearance than he was?''
asked LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson.
   ``Certainly more than he was,'' Magraw said.
   Magraw added that LaRouche spent 80 percent of his time at a
typewriter or computer keyboard and ``when he got working on a
political project he would work for 24 hours straight.''
   Magraw said, ``I don't believe Mr. LaRouche has ever gone on a
vacation'' and never takes days off.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years
in prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.
   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail
fraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.
   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser Wertz; his legal
adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: Michael Billington,
Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   The only source of drinking water in this
eastern Kentucky town ran dry this week, prompting Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson to declare a state of emergency.
   The declaration authorizes the National Guard to ship water in
from other areas.
   Wilkinson's executive order, dated Wednesday, cited the
``considerable hardship and ... health hazard'' that occurred when
the water level inside the source, an old coal mine, dropped during
the weekend.
   The system serves about 1,000 people.
   Additional relief was expected from Anheuser-Busch Co. in
Columbus, Ohio, which donated 50,000 12-ounce cans of pure water,
said Don Armstrong, a spokesman for the state Department of Disaster
and Emergency Services.

   A defense manufacturer is suing ABC News to regain
what the company said were stolen documents used for a story on
reputed parts overcharges for a U.S. Army vehicle.
   ``We don't know how they got the documents,'' said Pat Brozowski,
spokeswomen for FMC Corp., the Chicago-based builder of the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle.
   The ABC World News Tonight segment, which aired Oct. 20 quoting
unidentified former FMC employees, accused the company of
overcharging the government for spare parts on the vehicle, which
resembles a tank.
   ``We have not seen the lawsuit and cannot comment at this time,''
spokeswoman Elise Adde of ABC News said from New York.
   An in-house investigation of the television story ``turned up the
fact that the documents were missing from our files,'' Ms. Brozowski
said.
   The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Cook County Circuit Court.
   FMC also said it has told the government's General Accounting
Office it will cooperate with any investigation of prices charged on
the Bradley parts, according to the statement.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks announced a consumer
boycott and a sit-in Thursday to protest reimposed apartheid
measures in the industrial town of Boksburg, while major businesses
and sports bodies threatened sanctions.
   Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, was the first to resegregate
parks and other amenities since the Conservative Party won control
of dozens of municipalities in elections Oct. 26. Several other
towns now want to bar blacks from facilities opened to all races in
recent years.
   Blacks, who outnumber Boksburg whites by nearly 2-1, plan a
sit-in Friday at Boksburg Lake, a 37-acre park the City Council last
week reserved for whites.
   ``It will be a white Christmas without the snow,'' Buchanan
Jantjes, head of the management committee in Boksburg's mixed-race
Reiger Park township, said when he announced a black boycott of
white-owned businesses.
   Conservative Party spokesman Clive Derby-Lewis said the party
``is simply applying the laws which exist ... The whites generate
this country's economy and the so-called black spending power is
nothing more than the by-product of the white economy.''
   About 300 Boksburg whites and a few blacks packed into a church
hall Thursday night to plan a campaign against the council. Business
and civic leaders distributed petitions denouncing resegregation and
seeking a referendum.
   Several businessmen have signs in their windows that say ``All
Races Welcome.'' The Boksburg council said blacks are welcome to
shop _ they just cannot own businesses there.
   Major department stores announced they will not build where
renewed segregation threatens business, and 27 businesses signed a
petition urging the council to retract.
   The giant clothing chain Edgars Stores said it has withdrawn from
negotiations to build a new store in Boksburg because of the city's
questionable economic future.
   ``The fact that the questionable future in this instance is
directly a consequence of a bad policy decision needs to be
communicated very strongly,''said Fred Haupt, Edgars group general
manager.
   Boksburg Mayor Beyers de Klerk retaliated, ``I'm here to fight to
survive and I expect all the thunderbolts in hell to rain down on
me.''
   Cricket, golf, hockey and cycling federations said they will
cancel tours, prohibit tournaments and withdraw subsidies and
coaching from towns that resegregate.
   It is illegal under South Africa's 29-month state of emergency to
call for boycotts or economic sanctions. But the government has made
no attempt to stop such measures being used against Boksburg.
   The National Party, which has governed for 40 years, introduced
the major apartheid legislation and segregates some facilities in
cities it controls.
   Yet government officials have joined the chorus of condemnation.
They say reimposing stricter apartheid will trigger a black backlash
and give the country a bad name at a time when peace negotiations
and reprieves for condemned black prisoners have boosted the
government's international image.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis defended
apartheid laws Thursday, but said the government would stop the
Conservatives. ``It will not be tolerated that we move backwards,''
he said.
   President P. W. Botha reaffirmed his government's commitment to
``the maintenance of own communities for every population group.''

   NBC won the U.S. television rights to the 1992
Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, with a record bid of $401
million, The Associated Press learned today.
   NBC, which televised the Summer Olympics in Seoul, had been
considered a longshot to get the Barcelona rights. CBS was favored
because it already owns the TV rights to the 1992 Winter Games in
Albertville, France.
   The International Olympic Committee and the Barcelona Olympic
Organizing Committee scheduled a news conference later today for the
announcement.
   The amount of the winning bid was not immediately known, but a
source said NBC's bid was ``substantially higher'' than CBS'.
Olympic officials were seeking a minimum of $350 million.
   The Barcelona fee topped the previous record of $309 million paid
by ABC for the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. The network lost
an estimated $75 million. NBC paid $300 million for the TV rights in
Seoul. Sources said NBC made a ``modest'' profit, but much lower
than expected due to disappointing ratings that forced the netwo49 90.40

<TEXT>
   After three years investigating the worst
single-plane crash in history, police on Thursday sought criminal
charges against employees of the aircraft maker, airline and Japan's
Ministry of Transport.
   Police said the crash that killed 520 people was caused by
professional negligence of 20 people, including four Boeing Co.
employees, Japan Air Lines employees and four from the transport
ministry.
   They were responsible for aircraft repairs, maintenance and
inspection.
   The Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer Thursday rejected the
report and denied Japanese charges it hindered the investigation.
   Gunma Prefectural Police handed results of the probe to the
Maebashi District Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether to
press charges for negligence, a criminal offense in Japan.
   Police said they were unable to question the four Boeing
employees.
   But they said documents confiscated from Japan Air Lines provided
enough evidence to substantiate their involvement. The four
reportedly supervised a faulty repair of the aircraft in 1978 but
have refused repeated police requests for interviews.
   The Boeing 747 plowed into a mountain during a flight from Tokyo
to Osaka on Aug. 12, 1985, killing all but four people aboard.
   Japan is one of a few countries in which criminal charges are
sought against people responsible for airplane accidents, said
Hiroshi Itakura, criminal law professor at Tokyo's Nihon University.
   ``The most important thing in an accident like this is to
pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute
individuals,'' said Itakura. ``But unlike the United States, under
Japanese criminal law corporations cannot be charged for
wrongdoing.''
   Japan Air Lines President Susumu Yamachi said his company is
taking the police report seriously.
   Boeing, however, rejected it.
   ``Boeing does not believe that criminal acts were committed by
anyone and hopes that the district prosecutor's office also will
conclude that there was no criminal conduct,'' the company said in a
statement.
   Company sources said it planned to respond to the police inquiry,
but was unlikely to allow Japanese police to question individual
employees.
   Boeing has disclosed that it performed faulty repairs on the
aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 damaged the rear bulkhead,
the metal partition that protects the pressurized cabin.
   The aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978
at Osaka International Airport and underwent major repairs,
according to JAL.
   A government report in 1987 concluded that improper repairs
accelerated metal fatigue, which caused the bulkhead to burst,
blowing off part of the plane's tail fin and sending the jumbo jet
out of control.
   Police said the accident could have been avoided if Boeing had
performed the repairs properly, if Japan Air Lines had checked
repairs adequately, and if the transport ministry had inspected the
aircraft properly.
   JAL said about 70 percent of compensation claims have been
settled. The company and Boeing agreed to share compensation for
victims' families and the four survivors.

<HEAD>Gannett Chairman Calls for Shultz to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz should
resign for his ``glandular reaction'' in denying a visa for PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat to address the United Nations, Allen H.
Neuharth writes in a column in Friday's editions of USA Today.
   ``Drastic? Sure,'' wrote Neuharth, chairman of Gannett Co. Inc.
and founder of the newspaper. ``But better Shultz have egg on his
face as he rides off into the sunset than Uncle Sam have a black eye
for weeks or months.''
   Neuharth said Shultz should be replaced by James A. Baker III,
whom President-elect George Bush has picked to be his secretary of
state. Baker then should allow Arafat to address the U.N. General
Assembly in New York.
   ``Shultz's glandular reaction in KO-ing the New York City U.N.
appearance of PLO leader Yasser Arafat was unwise and unworldly,''
Neuharth wrote.
   Shultz announced last weekend that he was denying a visa to
Arafat on the ground the chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization supports terrorism.
   In his column, Neuharth wrote that the issue is not terrorism.
Instead, he said, ``It's simply whether the U.N. can invite anyone
it wishes to speak to it. How can the USA, champion of free speech,
be so presumptuous as to interfere?''
   Neuharth tempered his criticism with praise for Shultz's ``years
of faithful and often fruitful service'' with the federal government.

<HEAD>Ag Secretary Unveils 1989 Rice Program With $6.50 Support Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng on
Thursday unveiled the government's 1989 program for rice farmers
with a national average price-support level of $6.50 for each 100
pounds.
   That is down from a national average of $6.63 in 1988.
   Price support loans are paid by the government's Commodity Credit
Corp. to farmers who post their crops as collateral. Because
producers are free to forfeit the crops and keep the cash, the
system puts a floor under prices.
   Farmers must meet program requirements to qualify for federal
subsidies.
   Lyng announced a required acreage reduction of 25 percent. This
represents land that farmers cannot plant and is designed to prevent
surpluses.
   He set the established target price at $10.80 for each 100
pounds, down from $11.15 this year.
   Target prices are used in calculating so-called deficiency
payments that the government provides as income supports to
participants in some programs.
   Other provisions of the rice program:
   _Whole kernel milled rice price support rates were set at $10.81
per hundredweight for long grain and $9.81 for medium and short
grain rice. The broken kernel rate for all rice classes is $5.41.
   _Producers who pledged 1989 crop rice as collateral for price
support loans will not be permitted to purchase marketing
certificates when repaying loans at the marketing loan repayment
rate.
   _The discretionary inventory reduction program will not be
implemented.
   _Farmers may sign up for the program between Dec. 19 and April 14.

   The State Department has expressed concern to
the Honduran government over the detention of Washington Post
correspondent Julia Preston, who was held incommunicado overnight
after arriving in Tegucigalpa, it was disclosed Thursday.
   ``We have requested an official explanation of these actions,''
State Department press officer Ben Justesen said.
   He said Ms. Preston was denied permission to contact the U.S.
Embassy during her detention. She was taken into custody Tuesday
evening and left the country on Wednesday.
   ``We have expressed our concern to government of Honduras over
the denial of Ms. Preston's right to consular access and her
incommunicado detention,'' Justesen added.
   Honduran authorities reportedly were angered by an article Ms.
Preston wrote in which she said military personnel may have engaged
in human rights violations.

<HEAD>US Embassy Monitoring Conditions in Khmer Rouge Camps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy has changed its policy
and now sends staff members to monitor conditions in Cambodian
refugee camps run by the communist Khmer Rouge, a spokesman for the
mission said Thursday.
   U.S. officials had feared previously that an embassy presence in
the camps, where human rights violations are widespread, would be
used for political propaganda, sources reported. The Embassy said
camp visits began in September.
   American policy still is to avoid substantive contact with the
Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia in 1975-78 and killed hundreds of
thousands of people. It now is the largest guerrilla army fighting
Vietnamese occupation forces.
   The Khmer Rouge controls four U.N.-aided camps in Thailand near
the Cambodian border housing tens of thousands of refugees.
Documented abuses include forced military portering, relocation to
dangerous areas, denial of access to medical treatment and at least
two executions this year.
   ``We began these visits solely because of our humanitarian
concern for the populations of these camps,'' embassy spokesman Ross
Petzing said. ``We have made these visits only when representatives
of international organizations are present. Our visits are solely to
monitor conditions in the camps and are conducted by officers of the
embassy's refugee section.''
   Petzing said Embassy representatives had made about five visits.
   Shepard Lowman, director of the State Department's Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos desk until last December, said the U.S. government
``didn't make much of an effort'' before to find out about the camps.
   ``You didn't think about a return to power of the Khmer Rouge
because you were dealing with a stalemate,'' he said in an interview
Thursday. ``As people became more convinced a settlement is possible
... the Khmer Rouge question is very critical.
   ``It is Thailand and Thai sovereignty involved. It's a Thai
decision. We should encourage the Thais, though, to increasingly
press for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are
treated in a humanitarian way.
   ``I think it is in the Thai national interest to avoid a return
to power of the Khmer Rouge.''
   Lowman is president of a Refugees International, a voluntary
agency based in Washington.
   On Nov. 25, the State Department condemned forced relocations of
civilians from the Ta Luan camp.
   International relief officials said about 7,000 refugees were
moved from Ta Luan to Khao Phlu, a heavily mined, malarial jungle
along the frontier, and thousands of others were moved out of O'Trao.
   Relief officials said the guerrillas apparently planned to use
them to populate areas in Cambodia from which Vietnamese troops have
withdrawn.
   The new sites have been shelled this month from inside Cambodia,
forcing 3,000-5,000 people back to Ta Luan. A relief official who
visited the camp recently said many returned on foot, carrying their
belongings in backpacks.
   ``They were all digging shelters at Ta Luan,'' he said. ``They
were afraid Ta Luan also would come under attack.''
   On Tuesday, the Khmer Rouge radio denied relocating anyone by
force and said it had not forced refugees to work as porters. It
broadcast an ``open letter from a group of refugees'' in Khmer Rouge
camps saying they were performing a voluntary patriotic duty to hlp
liberate Cambodia.
   People who escaped say all except elderly people and pregnant
women were forced to fight or walk through mined forests carrying
rice, weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the front lines
inside Cambodia.
   Those who refused were jailed in harsh conditions, sometimes in
underground prisons with little food and their ankles shackled to
posts, they said in recent interviews with visiting reporters.

   Soviet authorities have notified at least 42
Jews who had been denied exit permits on grounds of state secrecy
that the barrier to emigration is being removed, the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry said Thursday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Shifter said he heard of the
barrier being lifted from Jewish sources after several conversations
with Soviet officials. He said he had no official confirmation from
Moscow.
   The move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of
American-financed Russian language broadcasts. Together, the two
steps represent a major improvement in human rights by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev before his meeting next week with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   The Jewish group announced, meanwhile, that 2,334 Soviet Jews had
been granted exit permits in November _ the largest monthly total
this year. Permits this year total 15,640, making the exodus the
biggest since 1980.
   Among the ``refuseniks'' informed of the change was Yuli
Kosharovsky, who has been waiting for more than 17 years for
permission to go to Israel. He had been denied a visa for classified
work he performed as an electronics engineer until 1968.
   Kosharovsky, who lives in Moscow and first applied for a permit
in 1971, was also a strong human rights activist, said Jerry
Strober, public information officer of the National Conference on
Soviet Jewry.
   ``He was told his secrecy ban had been lifted and to submit
papers to leave the country,'' Strober said. ``He expects to hear in
a month.''
   The official of the private group, which has lobbied in behalf of
Soviet Jews since 1971, said OVIR, the Soviet emigration office, had
told ``refusenik circles'' in Moscow that a total of 120 people
would have their secrecy restrictions lifted.
   Shoshana Cardin, chairman of the conference, welcomed ``the
lifting of secrecy imposed for many years on former prisoners of
conscience and long-term refuseniks. We look forward to the speedy
drafting of permission to emigrate to all those whose secrecy has
been lifted.''
   Also among those notified were Vladimir Kislik, a Moscow
physicist who first applied for an exit permit in 1973, and Roald
Zelichonok, a Leningrad electrical engineer who has been trying to
leave the Soviet Union since 1978.
   Kislik was arrested in 1981 on charges of malicious hooliganism
and served a three-year labor sentence. Zelichonok was arrested in
1985 on charges of defaming the state and served eight months.
   Strober said he knew of 42 Soviet Jews who had been notified the
restriction was being lifted.

   willing to die to protect him,'' State Police Superintendent Thomas
Constantine said of the governor Wednesday. ``When something like
this happens, it hurts.''
   Two men arrested on burglary charges in Oneida County were found
with stolen goods that included jewelry and other items from the
mansion.
   State Police are responsible for guarding the mansion, a mission
that for a time on Monday ``was not performed,'' Constantine said.
   Mrs. Cuomo didn't see the intruder, but two or three mansion
employees did before he slipped away, Constantine said.
   ``It would be an understatement to say that I'm extremely upset
about it,'' Constantine said. ``It's the type of thing that
shouldn't happen. It's not in keeping with the tradition of the
State Police being very professional.''
   The incident came a week after Cuomo revealed that he was on the
hit list of prominent people targeted by the Medellin drug cartel
for assassination. Constantine said there's no connection between
the intruder and the Colombian drug dealers.
   Security had been beefed up at the Executive Mansion after an
October 1984 break-in, when silverware, a video recorder and other
items were stolen while Cuomo and his wife slept upstairs.
   Cuomo press secretary Gary Fryer said it was his understanding
that one of the two men arrested this week had been able to get into
the mansion Monday and move about freely by identifying himself as a
repairman.
   Oneida County District Attorney Barry Donalty said he believed
the intruder didn't know he'd entered the governor's home at first.
   Cuomo called the security breach ``disconcerting,'' but said he
has his own personal security system.
   ``I have a 36-inch Louisville Slugger. No license, no nothing,''
Cuomo said, referring to a brand of baseball bat. The governor is a
former minor league baseball player.

<HEAD>Searle Attorneys Seek New Trial In $8 Million IUD Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after the 12th, beginning ``Strain said
Symchych,'' to add plaintiff's lawyer's comment, background on how
jury action came to light.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for G.D. Searle & Co. asked a
judge Thursday for a new trial after a jury awarded $8.15 million to
a woman who said the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused an
infection that left her infertile.
   A new trial should be granted because jurors were prejudiced by
information taken into the jury room by the jury foreman and other
members of the jury, said Paul Strain, attorney for the
Chicago-based pharmaceutical company.
   According to affidavits filed by three jurors, the jury foreman
smuggled a newspaper story about the trial into the jury room and
read it aloud, defying a court order. Jurors also talked about
definitions from a medical dictionary, which also had been forbidden
by Judge Robert Renner.
   ``Never has there been such evidence of extraneous prejudicial
influence in any case,'' Strain said.
   The jury said Searle's negligence in testing and its intentional
misrepresentations in marketing the Copper-7 led to the plaintiff's
sterility. But jurors also determined that Searle was not negligent
in its design or manufacture of the Copper-7.
   During the trial, attorneys for the plaintiff, Esther Kociemba,
sought to establish that Searle knew of potential health risks with
the Copper-7, but did not adequately disclose those risks to doctors
or the public.
   After hearing arguments, the judge took the case under advisement.
   It was the first time a jury awarded punitive damages against
Searle for a Copper-7-related illness and it was the largest award.
   About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986. Searle won 14 of the previous 17
cases to be decided.
   Strain also argued that the jury was coerced into reaching a
complete verdict after returning Sept. 9 with an incomplete jury
form.
   Jurors, who had deliberated almost 10 days, answered only seven
of the 17 questions and U.S. Magistrate Jan Symchych, sitting in for
Renner, instructed them to return to the jury room to complete the
form. The jurors completed the form and returned with the verdict a
short time later.
   Strain said Symchych did not have the legal authority to give
jury instructions and said she coerced the jury into giving a
verdict because she did not offer them the alternative of coming
back as a hung jury.
   Roger Brosnahan, an attorney for the plaintiff, said the jury had
already decided the case but inadvertently neglected to fill in 10
of the 17 answer blanks. He said Symchcych's instructions fell
within the ``administerial'' powers of her role as a replacement for
Renner.
   The alleged jury misconduct came to light after jurors were
questioned by Searle attorneys following the verdict. Three of the
jurors wrote a letter to Renner, saying they were ashamed to be
associated with a verdict that did not represent their true feelings.
   Searle lawyers also disputed arguments that Searle be required to
pay the attorney fees of Mrs. Kociemba, 30, of Elk River, Minn. They
said the fees of about $3 million were ``wildly outreaching.''
   Michael Ciresi, attorney for Mrs. Kociemba, said Searle should be
required to pay the fees under the Minnesota Consumers Protection
Act. He said his Minneapolis law firm took the case partly as a
public service.

<HEAD>Commerce Reports to Reagan on Restricting Oil Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department on Thursday sent to
President Reagan a secret recommendation on whether oil imports
should be restricted.
   Some domestic energy producers organized as the National Energy
Security Committee filed a petition with the department a year ago
requesting an investigation of whether imported oil threatens
national security.
   The report to the president is the outcome of the investigation.
President Reagan has 90 days to decide what to do, which means he
could leave the whole question to President-elect George Bush.
   ``The report is secret until the president makes a decision,''
said department spokeswoman Desiree Tucker.
   Under provisions of a 1962 law, the president may limit imports
of items found to threaten national security.
   The crude oil price collapse of 1986 devastated U.S. producers,
who had gone all-out to find new oil following the price increases
of the 1970s.
   From 48 percent of U.S. consumption in 1977, imported crude and
refined products fell to 32 percent of consumption in 1985, but rose
to 40 percent for all of last year.
   For the first 10 months of 1988, imports were 41 percent of
consumption compared with 39 percent in the same 1987 period.
October's imports were 43 percent vs. 41 percent in October 1987.
   Several government reports have warned that imports could reach
50 percent in the 1990s. ``At this rate we could hit 50 percent by
1990,'' said William C. McCord, chairman of Enserch Corp. and
spokesman for the National Energy Security Committee.

<TEXT>
   The commander of the Marine Corps' Parris
Island, S.C., Recruit Depot, rejecting the advice of his legal
adviser, granted clemency to a female corporal convicted of
homosexual conduct, the corps said Thursday.
   Maj. Gen. Jarvis D. Lynch, in an order signed Wednesday but not
released until late Thursday, ordered the one-year prison term
handed Cpl. Barbara J. Baum reduced to 226 days, said Maj. Robert
McLean, a spokesman.
   He also ordered her dishonorable discharge upgraded to a bad
conduct discharge, the spokesman said, but left untouched the
portions of the sentence that reduced her in rank to private and
required forfeiture of all pay and allowances.
   ``Combined with routine credit for good behavior, this
effectively means she will be released from the brig on December
15,'' McLean added.
   ``I'm obviously extremely happy that Major General Lynch saw fit
to reduce her time so that she'll be out for Christmas,'' said L.
Barrett Boss, one of Baum's defense attorneys.
   ``But this does not change the fact that Barbara Baum has had to
spend more than five months in prison as punishment for her sexual
preferences,'' Boss added.
   Lynch had been urged by his staff judge advocate at Parris Island
to deny a defense bid for clemency, even though Baum claimed to have
been promised leniency by a prosecutor in exchange for her
cooperation with investigators.
   The Marine Corps denied the prosecuting attorney in the case had
ever made a binding promise to the enlisted woman in soliciting her
cooperation with investigators, but promised Lynch would review all
the arguments in the case.
   Baum, 24, of Mishawaka, Ind., was convicted at court martial last
June and sentenced to a year in prison as part of a wide-ranging
investigation of alleged lesbian conduct among Parris Island
instructors.
   She is serving her sentence in a brig at the Quantico, Va.,
Marine Base.
   Last month, in a memorandum dated Nov. 8, the top staff lawyer at
Parris Island recommended Lynch deny Baum any clemency.
   Col. Gerald W. Jones, the staff judge advocate, noted briefly in
his memo that the prosecutor in Baum's case _ Maj. David Beck _ had
recommended a reduction in sentence because of her ``post-trial
cooperation'' and because of ``corroboration'' of claims that she
had been sexually abused as a child.
   Nonetheless, Jones recommended the general ``approve the sentence
as adjudged.''
   The only explanation Jones offered was a single sentence stating:
``No corrective action based upon trial error or the review
procedure is appropriate.''
   McLean said Thursday he could not elaborate on Lynch's reasons
for granting clemency despite that recommendation.
   ``The general took this action after reviewing all the facts and
concluding that this sentence modification was in the best interest
of good order and discipline in the corps and of Corporal Baum,''
McLean said.
   According to Boss, Baum agreed to cooperate with investigators
after her conviction and spent 14 hours in interrogation. While no
written agreement was ever signed, ``she had a clear understanding
that in exchange for her cooperation, she would get clemency,'' Boss
said.
   Boss also argued that over and beyond Baum's decision to
cooperate with investigators, the Marine should be released early
from prison in order to seek psychological treatment.
   Baum has testified she was sexually abused by several men while a
child and now wants to obtain therapy, the defense attorney said.
   ``We do not intend to lay the matter to rest after she gets out
of prison,'' Boss said Thursday. ``We will continue to appeal the
conviction on a variety of grounds.''

   Rockwell International Corp. and the Pentagon
should investigate allegations from Ohio workers who say inferior
parts may have been used in building the B-1 bomber, Rep. John
Kasich and Sen. John Glenn said Thursday.
   Kasich, R-Ohio and Glenn, D-Ohio, asked for the probe in letters
to Rockwell and Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge.
   Four B-1B bombers have crashed in the four years the plane has
been flying, including two in November.
   After the most recent crash, four former employees of Rockwell's
Columbus, Ohio, plant told Columbus station WBNS-TV that substandard
parts that were set aside later disappeared. The workers said they
feared the parts were used to build the bombers and keep production
on schedule.
   ``As members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees,
we are particularly concerned about the potential impact of these
allegations on the morale and safety of B-1 aircrews and the combat
readiness of the B-1 fleet,'' Kasich and Glenn wrote.
   ``We consider these allegations to be extremely serious and
deserving of a thorough and prompt investigation to determine their
validity.''
   Mike Mathews, a spokesman for the Rockwell unit that operates the
Columbus plant, said earlier that Rockwell had investigated similar
claims by two of the workers identified in the television report and
found no bad parts had been used.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday
refused to block the deportation of five Cubans held in Alabama,
clearing the way for the first repatriation of Mariel boat people
since a 1987 agreement with Cuba.
   The detainees are scheduled to leave for Cuba from the Birmingham
airport Friday morning. Announcement of the repatriation agreement
sparked uprisings last year at two federal prisons where the Cubans
were held.
   Two of the five detainees did not oppose deportation, and the
other three lost their legal fight when Supreme Court Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, without comment, denied their emergency
application for a stay of repatriation.
   The three previously were turned down by a federal judge in
Birmingham and by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   The government had planned to fly the five to Cuba on Thursday,
but postponed the flight after Cuba asked for more time to prepare
for their arrival.
   The five left Cuba in the 1980 boatlift from Mariel, Cuba, but
were placed in custody in America pending deportation because of
their criminal records in this country. They have been imprisoned at
Talladega, 60 miles east of Birmingham.
   Some of the 125,000 people in the illegal boatlift were convicts
or mentally ill.
   The Justice Department said deportation of the five would resume
a repatriation program that began in 1984. The five are among 15
Talladega inmates designated for return to Cuba after reviews by
panels the Justice Department set up a year ago.
   U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon said he will decide by Monday
whether to delay the return of the other 10.
   The United States is trying to return to Cuba as many as 2,500
Marielitos as ``excludable aliens,'' or those convicted of serious
crimes in this country. Attorneys for the inmates argue they will be
persecuted if they are sent home.
   The government sent back 201 Cubans several years ago, but Cuban
President Fidel Castro halted the repatriations in 1985 before
agreeing last year to accept 2,746.
   That agreement resulted in riots by Cubans in federal prisons at
Atlanta and Oakdale, La. The detainees later were dispersed, and 114
are at Talladega.
   In asking Clemon not to order a delay, attorneys for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said the 13 had received full
reviews of their cases. The attorneys accused the Cubans of using
delaying tactics.
   The three who sought court intervention are Miguel
Beitia-Socarraz, 28, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary;
Onel Calzado-Garlobo, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual
assault charges involving a 13-year-old girl; and Rene Maurin-Oliva,
25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery.

   A swift-moving fire destroyed an
oil-soaked pier early Thursday, killing one man and burning at least
11 boats and two cars, authorities said.
   Authorities ordered a brief evacuation of a nearby area after
hearing reports the pier was treated with creosote, a carcinogenic
substance.
   One man asleep in his boat when the fire broke out died when his
craft caught fire, said Morro Bay Fire Department spokesman Fred
Harpster. The man was not immediately identified.
   A man and a woman also were taken to Sierra Vista Hospital for
treatment. Their conditions were not immediately available.
   Firefighters were able to save shops and restaurants near the
pier.
   The fire was reported at about 6:15 a.m.
   Firefighters were told by people at the scene that the pier was
treated with creosote, a carcinogen the federal Environmental
Protection Agency has banned from over-the-counter sales as a wood
treatment and from use as a pesticide.
   Authorities ordered an evacuation of businesses and residences
downwind from the fire for about a quarter mile.
   A Coast Guard Marine Safety crew was en route from San Francisco
to check for pollution, said Coast Guard spokesman Fred Smith.

   Soviet officials informed 45 Jewish refuseniks who
have been denied visas on the grounds of state secrecy that barriers
to their leaving the country are being dropped, a refusenik
spokesman said Thursday.
   The notification, made in telephone calls from the OVIR visa
agency Wednesday and Thursday, did not amount to permission to
emigrate, but was a signal that officials probably will let many of
them leave in the near future.
   ``They told several people to expect permission in a month,''
said Vladimir Kislik, a spokesman for Jews denied permission to
leave the Soviet Union.
   Kislik, a physicist who first applied to emigrate in 1973, and
Yuli Kosharovsky, who has been awaiting permission for 17 years,
were among those who received telephone calls. Kosharovsky had been
denied a visa for classified work he performed as an electronics
engineer until 1968.
   No reason was given, but in the past Soviet officials sometimes
let promiment refuseniks go before a major international meeting.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev leaves next week on a trip that will
take him to the United States, Cuba and Britain.
   Thursday's move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of
American-financed Russian language broadcasts. Together, the two
steps were seen as representing a major improvement in human rights
by Gorbachev before his meeting next week with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
   Under Gorbachev's more liberal policies, most prominent
refuseniks were allowed to emigrate in late 1987 and early 1988. The
Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said 13,039 Jews were allowed to
emigrate between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31, 1988.
   Many lesser-known refuseniks remain behind, and they complain
that the Soviet Union arbitrarily has used access to state secrets
as a pretext for keeping them here.
   Kislik said in some cases, refuseniks were told only a month or
two ago that their cases could not be reconsidered before the mid or
late 1990s. ``And now they called, and said the term had been
removed,'' he said.
   In Washington, a congressional commission set up to oversee
implementation of the Helsinki agreement on security and cooperation
in Europe welcomed the news from Moscow.
   ``This development ... signals what we hope will be a trend
toward sustained human rights improvement in the Soviet Union,''
said commission chairman Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., in a statement.
   Jerry Strober, spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, said in Washington that Kosharovsky was a strong human rights
activist.
   ``He was told his secrecy ban had been lifted and to submit
papers to leave the country,'' Strober said. ``He expects to hear in
a month.''
   Strober said OVIR told ``refusenik circles'' in Moscow that 120
people in all would have their secrecy restrictions lifted,
including Leningrad electrical engineer Roald Zelichonok, who has
been trying to leave since 1978.
   The peak of Soviet Jewish emigration was 1979, when 51,330 people
were allowed to leave. The number fell to about 1,000 in the
mid-1980s when U.S.-Soviet relations deteriorated because of the
Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan.
   It began to climb again in 1986 and 1987.
   The United States has 11,000 Soviets on a waiting list for
interviews at the U.S. Embassy to see if they are eligible to enter
the United States, a senior diplomat said in Moscow. Those on the
list already have been granted permission to leave the Soviet Union.
   The embassy has been inundated by applicants, most of them
Armenians.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 66
percent of the 2,400 applications received in October were from
Armenians and 26 percent from Soviet Jews.
   The Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, an agency in
Geneva helping in resettlement of Soviet Jews, said Thursday that
2,284 Jews were allowed to emigrate to the West in November. It said
this year's exodus total of 16,572 is already more than double last
year's 8,011 and that the 1988 outflow is certain to be the highest
since 1980.
   Only 1,314 of this year's arrivals at an ICM transit center in
Vienna have gone to Israel, agency spokeswoman Regina Boucault said
in Geneva.

<HEAD>Snow Falls Around Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to a foot of snow fell Thursday around Lake Erie, with lesser
amounts around the rest of the Great Lakes, and parts of Arkansas
had lowland flooding from recent heavy rain.
   By the midday, snow fell from central New York state and the
northeast two-thirds of Pennsylvania across the lower Great Lakes,
northern Ohio, northern Indiana, northern Illinois, southern
Wisconsin and Michigan.
   On the downwind side of Lake Erie, in western New York state,
about 12 inches of snow fell at Colden, Dunkirk and Springville.
Seven inches fell at Glenfield, with 6 inches at Gowanda and 5 at
Silver Creek.
   Along the southern shore of the lake in Ohio, about 8 inches of
snow covered North Perry, Madison and northern Geauga County by
early afternoon. Lesser amounts over northeastern Ohio included 4
inches at Mentor, Ashtabula and Thompson, 2 inches at Chardon and an
inch at Burton.
   Traverse City, Mich., got 3 inches of snow in the six hours up to
1 p.m. EST.
   Elsewhere, snow was scattered across central Kentucky into
central Tennessee.
   In eastern and northeastern Arkansas, lowland flooding continued
along sections of the lower White, Black, Cache and St. Francis
rivers.
   Flood warnings were posted over the Sulphur River and Cypress
Creek basins of northeastern Texas and the Sabine River basin in
eastern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Faribault, Minn., to 81 at Oceanside and Point Mugu,
Calif. Thursday morning's official low was 9 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn.
   For Friday, rain was forecast over the northern section of the
Pacific Coast.
   Highs only in the 20s were predicted over northern Maine; near 30
over southwestern Pennsylvania; in the 30s and 40s from central
Maine across the Virginias, over the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes,
the upper Mississippi Valley, the Rockies, and from the central
Rockies to much of the northern half of the Pacific Coast; in the
60s to near 70 over the Florida Peninsula; in the 70s across central
Texas and from southern Arizona across southern California; and in
the 50s and 60s over the remainder of the nation.

   The most recent surprise inspections of the
nation's nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food
sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent didn't properly
administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene, the government
reported Thursday.
   In a 75-volume guide for consumers, federal officials released
grades for each of the 15,000 nursing homes on 32 of the
approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once
a year in on-site inspections.
   Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories.
But about 2,400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32
categories.
   The massive report, a compilation of material previously
available only on a piece-meal basis through state regulatory
agencies, amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for
people looking for a nursing home.
   ``I think this is a landmark achievement, not because it an end
to itself but because it will help people pose thoughtful, further
questions in seeking out a nursing home,'' said Dr. William L.
Roper, head of the Health Care Financing Administration that
oversees Medicare and Medicaid.
   But neither the nursing-home industry nor its severest critics
greeted the report with enthusiasm. Elma Holder, director of the
National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, said Roper
``should be embarrassed and ashamed to present these documents so
proudly ... At best they provide a teaser to the consumers to try to
obtain a copy of the full survey report of the facility.''
   Dr. Paul Willging, executive vice president of the 9,000-memember
American Health Care Association, the major nursing home trade
group, called the report unreliable and ``In fact, the guide could
be harmful to consumers who use it as a shortcut to selecting a
nursing home.''
   But the American Association of Retired Persons praised the
report as a ``good start'' toward full disclosure of information
about nursing home quality.
   ``We are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable
information about the quality of nursing home care out of its
computers and made it available to the individuals and families who
need it most,'' said AARP Executive Director Horace Deets.
   Roper acknowledged it should not be viewed as a one-stop guide,
and conceded that a major shortcoming was that the 32 performance
indicators were listed only as having been ``met'' or ``unmet,''
rather than showing the severity of failures.
   For example, a nursing home that needed 30 nurses on staff to
meet patient-nurse ratios and had only 26 would receive the same
``unmet'' citation as if it only had 10 nurses.
   By law, the most recent and full report has to be available for
inspection at each nursing home, giving more detail for what led to
``unmet'' citations.
   ``This document ... is not the ultimate report on nursing homes
across the country but we present national statistics in order to be
helpful in interpreting how a given nursing home compares to other
nursing homes across the country,'' Roper said at a news conference.
   In addition to showing that 42.8 percent of the nursing homes
received an ``unmet'' grade when measured against minimum federal
standards for food storage, preparation and distribution, the report
found these other ``unmet'' percentages:
   _Daily personal hygiene standard for patients, 29.8 percent.
   _Proper and timely administration of prescribed drugs, 29 percent.
   _Isolation techniques to prevent spread of infection, 24.7
percent.
   _Rehabilitative care to promote maximum physicial functioning to
prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move freely, 21.6
percent.
   None of the other 27 categories registered an ``unmet''
percentage above 20 percent.
   At the A-plus end of the scale, the report shows that 99.7
percent meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients;
99.6 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others; 99.5
percent provide emergency medical services as necessary.
   Willging, speaking for the industry, noted the report is based on
the judgments of more than 3,000 inspectors, and that the most
recent inspections included in the document occurred last summer.
Some are 18 months old.
   ``Consumers must not consider the HCFA report a substitute for
visiting nursing homes during the slection process,'' said Willging.
``Visting and asking the right questions are essential.''
   Sheldon L. Goldbert, president of the American Association of
Homes For The Aging, another trade group, said, ``The report renders
high-quality care and substandard care nearly indistinguishable by
its failure to separate serious, ongoing problems from minor,
one-time infractions.''
   But Ms. Holder of the non-profit reform coalition said: ``We
think the national statistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''

   Sixty-one senators and eight senators-elect,
including Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, on Thursday endorsed the
decision by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to deny a visa to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   The 35 Republicans and 34 Democrats told Shultz in a letter that
Arafat was associated with terrorism and has ``no place in the
United States.'' Barring Arafat was entirely justified because
Arafat is chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which,
they said, ``engages in terrorism.''
   ``The U.S. government has convincing evidence that PLO elements
have engaged in terrorism against Americans,'' the lawmakers told
Shultz. ``As you rightfully and lawfully concluded, such an
individual has no place in the United States.''
   The letter-writing effort was organized by Sens. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
   ``We must continue our policy of denying admission to our country
those, including Arafat, who profess terrorism as a tool of foreign
policy,'' DeConcini said.
   Grassley said the PLO under Arafat remains committed to terrorism
and added: ``Shultz's action makes it clear that the U.S. will not
tolerate such activity.''
   Arafat sought a visa to visit the United States in order to
address the United Nations General Assembly.
   Shultz's decision prompted an international uproar and the
General Assembly on Wednesday approved a resolution deploring the
move and declaring it a violation of U.S. responsibilities as the
host nation for the U.N.
   A strong sentiment developed for moving the assembly session to
Geneva in order that Arafat might address it.

   President Reagan said Thursday he is against a
pardon for former aide Oliver L. North, but ``duty requires'' his
administration to block release of secret documents that may be
needed for North's trial on Iran-Contra charges.
   Reagan commented in response to reporters' questions after his
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said disclosure of documents sought by
North's lawyers for use in his defense would reveal ``state secrets
of the highest order.''
   ``We have indicated there are categories of information included
in these documents which cannot be declassified at any point,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Reagan, questioned at the beginning of a meeting on trade issues
in the Oval Office, said, ``The things we are blocking are the
things that duty requires we block.''
   ``These are things that are national security secrets,'' he said.
``This is something that from the very beginning we knew we would
have to do.''
   He denied that the move was an attempt to sabotage North's trial
and said, ``The law must take its course.''
   Asked whether he still believed, as he stated earlier this year,
that North and former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
will ultimately be found innocent, the president said:
   ``At this stage, I don't think I should comment on guilt or
innocence or anything of this kind.''
   When asked whether this meant he would not grant pardons for
North and Poindexter, he replied, ``From the very beginning, I said
that to consider a pardon would leave them under a shadow of guilt
for the rest of their lives. I think we have to let the judicial
process proceed.''
   Last June 27, Reagan responded to a question on the subject by
saying, ``I believe in the innocence of the two men and I would like
to see that established once and for all.``
   Fitzwater said the White House has offered a briefing to U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who is scheduled to preside over
North's trial, but had not received a response.
   He said it was ``up to the judge'' to decide whether the
classified material is relevant to North's defense and, if it is,
whether the indictments against him should be dismissed or he should
be tried.
   ``This information involves sensitive methods and sources and
exceedingly sensitive programs which are state secrets of the
highest order,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Gesell was advised of the administration position last
week when White House counsel A.B. Culvahouse wrote to independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who is prosecuting the case, and Walsh
filed a pleading with the court.
   The secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to
the diversion _ conspiracy and theft of government property.
However, North also could be tried on other charges, including
allegations he made false statements to Congress and conspired to
illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the Contras.
   Fitzwater said the decision not to release the documents was made
in July by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci, CIA Director William Webster, national security
adviser Colin L. Powell and Lt. Gen. William Odom, director of the
National Security Agency.
   The spokesman said the decision was unanimous. It was passed on
to Walsh, who Fitzwater said did not object to it and indicated he
could pursue his case against North on the basis of unclassified
material.
   Later, North's attorneys said they wanted to use some of this
material in his defense.
   Gesell recently cautioned the White House that he would not be
able to control the flow of information once North's trial started,
possibly in late January, and pointed out that the president has
legal and constitutional means by which to do so.
   Fitzwater said he assumed the reference to constitutional means
referred to the possibility of a pardon for North, which he said has
not been considered.
   But he said the administration acted by legal means when the
administration officials, following the Classified Procedures Act,
made their decision in July.
   He said Culvahouse wrote to Walsh after officials concluded, from
what Gesell said, that the judge did not know of the July decision.
   Fitzwater said the decision was not reviewed by Reagan.
   ``These judgments were made by the security agencies involved and
not by the White House and ... are not political in any fashion,''
he said.
   ``These state secrets are essential to the national security of
the United States and cannot be disclosed in any form.''
   Fitzwater said he was referring both to sensitive information
deleted from 350 documents Walsh plans to use as evidence and to the
40,000 pages of material that North contends are needed for his
defense. Walsh earlier received administration approval to use the
350 documents as long as sensitive portions were blacked out or
deleted.
   North is trying to persuade Gesell that the uncensored versions
of the documents should be used in any trial.
   ``There is information in those documents that we know we cannot
declassify,'' he said.
   However, he said, ``these secrets which cannot be discosed have
been identified ... as material to the defense and it is up to the
judge to determine whether it is relevant. If it is, it is up to him
to decide what happens to the various counts of the indictment.''
   Meantime Thursday, Gesell presided for a second day at
closed-door hearings on North's objections to deleting sensitive
references from classified documents that Walsh wants to use as
evidence.
   North argues that the references to countries, foreign officials
and U.S. intelligence agents are necessary to defend charges that he
conspired to divert more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Man Who Claimed He Taped Brawley Advisers Is Indicted For Perjury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who said he recorded conversations of
advisers to Tawana Brawley _ who said she was a victim of a racist
sex attack but refused to cooperate with police _ but then produced
only blank tapes has been indicted.
   Samuel McClease, 26, a self-described surveillance expert from
Newark, N.J., was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The indictment
closely paralleled a criminal complaint filed against him last
summer.
   The action comes a month after a state grand jury concluded that
Ms. Brawley, a black teen-ager from upstate New York, had concocted
her story of abduction and sexual assault by whites.
   McClease, who has been free on $100,000 bond, will be arraigned
Dec. 8, said Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine on each count, if convicted.
   There was no telephone listing for McClease in Newark. His
lawyer, Leonard Joy of the Legal Aid Society, was not in his
Manhattan office when called for comment.
   Ms. Brawley, formerly of Wappingers Falls, touched off a
nationwide controversy after claiming she had been abducted and
sexually assaulted for several days by up to six white men,
including one who flashed a police badge.
   Ms. Brawley and her family, however, refused to cooperate with
state investigators on the advice of lawyers C. Vernon Mason and
Alton H. Maddox Jr. and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
   In June, McClease told federal investigators and television
reporters that he had bugged the conversations of Ms. Brawley's
advisers and could produce tapes that undermined her story.
   McClease claimed Sharpton hired him to bug his home as well as
Mason's home and office.
   Sharpton has vigorously denied McClease's claims.
   According to the indictment, McClease claimed he had 10 audio
tapes of conversations among Mason, Maddox and Sharpton.
   But McClease could produce only blank tapes in reply to a grand
jury subpoena. He signed an affidavit saying he could not produce
the tapes.

<HEAD>Leadership Calls for Calm, Death Toll Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told officials in
Armenia and Azerbaijan on Thursday to restore order in their
neighboring southern republics, where 28 people have been killed in
recent ethnic violence.
   Gorbachev called the Communist Party leaders of the republics,
and deputies to the Supreme Soviet, to a meeting after the national
parliament issued an appeal for calm in the Caucasus at the end of a
three-day session.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said the death toll in the
past two weeks had reached 28, which brings to more than 60 the
number of people killed since trouble began between Armenia and
Azerbaijan in February over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's population is predominantly ethnic Armenian
but the territory does not have a common border with Armenia. It was
assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Armenia and Armenians in the territory want it annexed to
Armenia, but Azerbaijan and the Kremlin have refused.
   In a report on Thursday's meeting, the official news agency Tass
said: ``It was emphasized that inter-ethnic conflicts, strikes on
this basis and anti-social phenomena cause serious damage to the
economy and are objectively directed against the democratic
processes of renewal.''
   Under Gorbachev's leadership, the meeting called for ``the
resolute rejection of the attempts to sow discord and enmity on
national soil, and for the immediate establishment of close working
contacts on settling the situation in the region.''
   In a speech to the Supreme Soviet, the Kremlin representative in
the troubled region said ``the two republics literally boil,'' and
officials are finding it difficult to control the situation.
   ``Recent developments have shown most forcefuly that many levers
are still in the hands of all kinds of clans in Azerbaijan and
Armenia,'' Arkady Volsky said, and the official press in both
republics ``pour oil on the fire.''
   Tass quoted Alexander Katusev, deputy procurator-general, as
saying prosecutors, investigators and other officials were being
sent to Azerbaijan from all parts of the Soviet Union.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman identified as B. Mikhailov gave
Pravda the new death toll and said, without explanation, that it
included ``victims of circumstances not directly related to the
situation.'' He said the deaths were caused by ``provocative
incidents and even shooting.''
   Authorities have confiscated homemade pistols, sawed-off rifles
and explosives from young people in both Armenia and Azerbaijan, he
said.
   Ethnic rioting began in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at the
end of February. At least 32 people were killed _ 26 Armenians and
six Azerbaijanis.

   President David Letterman? No? How about
President Ted Koppel or Commander in Chief Mickey Mouse?
   They all got write-in votes in California. So did Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, actor Clint Eastwood and several other famous
people.
   Los Angeles County election data made public Tuesday showed about
2,000 residents opted not to vote for either Republican George Bush
or Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   In all, 4,081 write-in votes were cast for ineligible
non-candidates for various offices.
   ``We've been getting away from a lot of the Mickey Mouse stuff,''
said Margarite Brown, division chief of election services. ``But the
write-ins were heavier this time.''
   Some of the others receiving write-in votes for president were

   When a horde of husky Santas in full regalia
gathered at a downtown hotel lobby and began ho-ho-ho-ing, the
excitement was just too much for the children, who wept and clutched
their mothers in terror.
   It probably wouldn't have calmed them much to know that behind
those red suits was much of the Wheaton College football team's
offensive and defensive lines.
   ``I really love kids, but I didn't realize they'd be so scared,''
said Chris Davis, 19, of San Diego. ``I reached out to shake one's
hand and she started crying,'' he said Wednesday.
   The bravest youngster on hand was Nadia Sawtarie from Japan.
   The 3-year-old assessed the invaders from behind her mother's
skirts and then gathered the courage to venture out and offer a
tentative wave before scurrying back to safety.
   The fledgling Santas were gathered at the hotel to celebrate
their graduation from Santa school.
   The basics? Know all the reindeers' names. Forgo alcohol, tobacco
and garlic. Don't make any specific promises. And gently hold the
childrens' hands _ it's soothing and keeps him from grabbing the
beard.

   A man who spent five days stranded in the
Never Summer Mountains and watched his friend die in his arms said
Thursday he ``never really panicked,'' but just concentrated on
staying alive.
   ``Wondering what was going to happen next was the biggest
thing,'' said Jim Edson, 38, speaking from his hospital bed at St.
Anthony's Medical Clinic in Granby, where he was listed in good
condition.
   Edson and Ray Owens, 66, last Friday embarked on what they
expected would be a relaxing afternoon snowmobiling in the woods.
   They took a wrong turn and their snowmobiles got bogged down in a
snow-choked gulch 16 miles northwest of Grand Lake, Edson said.
   The exertion of trying to climb out of the gulch caused Owens to
have a heart attack, Edson said. He died Sunday.
   Edson waded out of the heavily wooded, snow-whipped mountains
some 50 miles northwest of Denver on Wednesday, exhausted and with
his face blackened by campfire smoke, but otherwise in surprisingly
good condition.
   ``Once Ray died, I knew that I was on my own,'' he said. ``It's
hard when your best friend dies in your arms. There was nothing I
could do but let him lay where he died.''
   Authorities recovered Owens' body late Wednesday afternoon and
Grand County Coroner Dave Schoenfeld said Thursday his preliminary
examination of Owens' body ``indicates exactly what his partner said
happened to him.'' He said an autopsy would be completed late Friday.
   Edson said Owens suffered his first chest pains Friday, and that
he took him down to the gulch and built a fire and makeshift
shelter. Edson said he used gasoline and a sparkplug from the mired
snowmobiles to light fires since he had no matches.
   ``We couldn't get back up the way we came down,'' Edson said.
``We went down a little further, hoping we'd come out on a trail ...
but we didn't.''
   On Saturday, the men slept a lot and ate the trail mix, salami,
cheese, crackers and fruit they had brought with them, Edson said.
   On Sunday, they heard searchers' snowmobiles and an airplane and
began burning green boughs in an effort to attract rescuers.
   But blinding snow and whiteout conditions made the smoke signal
useless, and Edson said he felt ``frustration that we didn't get
their attention but elation knowing they were looking for us.''
   Edson said the men then decided to strike out on their own but
the exertion proved too much for Owens.
   ``He said, `Let's go real slow,' but we didn't get more than 15
feet from the camp and he decided he wasn't going,'' Edson said.
   ``He's gone, but I have hopes of seeing him again,'' said Edson,
who was an elder with Owens at a Jehovah's Witnesses church in
Federal Heights.
   During Edson's five days in the woods, temperatures were below
zero, and freezing winds sent wind-chill factors to minus 30 degrees.
   The search was called off Tuesday night.
   Edson stayed with his friend's body until Wednesday, hoping
rescuers would find him. He said Owens was the one familiar with the
area, and he was lost once Owens died.
   Edson said he spent his time praying and thinking about the
weather, the rescue effort and whether his contact lenses would hold
out.
   Edson said he began walking about 7 a.m. Wednesday. He ran across
snowmobile tracks indicating searchers had been less than two miles
from his campfire. At about 2 p.m., he ran into logger Tony Winter.
``It felt just grand,'' Edson said.
   Edson said Winter ``must have thought I was a ghost. I couldn't
hardly talk _ I hadn't talked in two or three days. I was trying to
squeak out the words and he just said, `C'mon around and get in the
truck.'''

<HEAD>Top Mafia Leaders Arrested In U.S.-Italian Drug Raids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police carried out raids
Thursday as part of a U.S.-Italian crackdown on a drug ring that
brought cocaine to Italy on banana boats and sold heroin through
American pizza parlors, officials said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the people named in Italian
arrest warrants belonged to the Spatola, Gambino and Inzerillo crime
families in Italy and the United States. State-run RAI-TV said
several top Mafia figures were among those arrested, but gave no
names.
   An FBI statement released Thursday in Rome and Washington said
drug charges were filed against 208 people _ 75 in the United States
and 133 in Italy. The arrests followed a joint investigation of
Italian and U.S. authorities.
   Hundreds of Italian police, some using helicopters and dogs,
began the raids overnight in Milan, Naples, Florence, Bologna,
Cosenza, Trapani, Palermo and the Palermo suburb Torretta.
   They said they 12 people had been arrested by late Thursday, but
U.S. officials in Washington said 22 people had been taken into
custody in Italy.
   Italian news media said the government also asked the United
States to extradite eight reputed Mafia members living in the United
States.
   Italian authorities said the drug traffickers smuggled South
American cocaine aboard banana boats to ports in Belgium, Holland
and West Germany, then overland to Italy. The cocaine, intended for
sale in Europe, was exchanged for heroin that was smuggled into the
United States for sale throug pizzerias, officials said.
   The FBI said it also discovered cocaine was being sent from South
America to a laboratory 300 miles north of Madrid, Spain, to be
processed and sent to Italy.
   U.S. federal agents made arrests in New York; Philadelphia;
Miami; Baltimore; San Francisco; Newark, N.J.; Buffalo, N.Y., and
Rockford, Ill.
   Italian news agencies said the simultaneous drug raids came after
an investigation stemming from the so-called ``Pizza Connection''
international drug ring that sold $1.6 billion in heroin, mostly
through pizzerias in the United States.
   The U.S. part of that case ended in March 1987 with 18
convictions. Italian prosecutors have indicted 28 people for their
alleged involvement.
   FBI officials said Thursday's arrests followed a complex,
international investigation that began as separate inquiries three
years ago in Buffalo, Philadelphia and New York.
   Italian investigators joined the undercover operation two years
ago after the arrest of heroin couriers at airports in Palermo and
New York. The Italian news agency AGI said the women were paid about
$7,800 for every kilogram _ 2.2 pounds _ of heroin they smuggled
from Italy to the United States inside money belts.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa got more than 100 telegrams of
praise for his television debate with the government union chief,
and a banner saying ``Bravo, Lech'' was hung on the Warsaw
University campus Thursday.
   Solidarity supporters felt the founder of the outlawed free union
won Wednesday night's contest with Alfred Miodowicz, head of the
official labor unions, and senior advisers celebrated into the night.
   The 43-minute debate was Walesa's first appearance on Polish
television in five years and his longest ever. He vigorously
defended Solidarity's right to exist and said official unions should
join it in ``creating freedom.''
   Walesa is a shipyard electrician and led a strike in the
turbulent summer of 1980 that gave birth to Solidarity, the first
free union in the Soviet bloc.
   Poland's communist authorities initially recognized Solidarity,
but then suppressed and outlawed it after martial law was declared
in December 1981.
   Walesa complained of a touch of flu during and after debate and
returned home to the Baltic port of Gdansk on the early morning
express train. A crowd of supporters greeted him when it pulled in
at 10 a.m.
   Later in the day, the Solidarity Information Service said more
than 100 telegrams of congratulation had arrived and the ``Bravo,
Lech'' banner flew at the university for most of the day.
   Official media reported the debate prominently Thursday but
avoided comment on who won. Newspapers carried photographs of Walesa
on their front pages for the first time in seven years, standing
next to Miodowicz.
   A commentator on Thursday's evening news said: ``Last night's
television meeting of Miodowicz and Walesa gathered a record
audience. This is a new notion in our political culture. Everybody
(watched), even those who are apathetic.''
   The newspaper Express Wieczorny quoted sociology professor
Andrzej Tymowski as saying: ``The meeting was successful, but there
are no words that can do something in Poland. We need acts. ...
Basing the reform on television talks only will give us nothing.''

   The ex-girlfriend of a lawyer accused of fatally
beating his illegally adopted daughter testified Thursday that she
did not seek emergency help for the 6-year-old because she thought
her lover had healing powers.
   Hedda Nussbaum, fighting back sobs, got her first sight of Joel
Steinberg since the two were arrested in the November 1987 death of
6-year-old Lisa Steinberg. Steinberg, 47, is charged with
second-degree murder. Charges against Nussbaum have been dropped.
   Lisa's death gained national attention when it became known that
teachers and friends of the family had noticed symptoms of abuse but
failed to notify anybody. The state of New York has since passed the
so-called ``Lisa Steinberg laws'' that make it a crime not to report
such abuse.
   Nussbaum testified that she was in the bathroom when Steinberg
handed her the girl's limp body on the night of Nov. 1, 1987, after
Steinberg allegedly beat her.
   ``You knew Lisa was not asleep, didn't you?'' asked Assistant
District Attorney Peter Casolaro.
   ``Yes,'' Nussbaum replied, closing her eyes. Her mouth quivered
and she struggled to maintain her composure.
   Nussbaum, 46, had answered early questions in a steady, husky
voice, but increasingly fought back sobs.
   While on the stand, she twice looked at Steinberg _ once, for a
long moment, when she identified a photograph of Lisa, and again
when she spoke of her agreement to testify against him.
   After Steinberg left their Greenwich Village apartment to go to
dinner, Nussbaum said, ``I looked at the phone and I started
thinking, should I call 911'' or the child's doctor.
   Casolaro asked her why she didn't.
   ``Joel said he would take care of her, he'd get her up when he
got back,'' Nussbaum replied. ``I didn't want to show disloyalty or
distrust for him, so I didn't call.''
   Casolaro asked what she expected Steinberg to do.
   ``I expected him to get Lisa up because I thought he was a
healer,'' Nussbaum testified. The child died three days later.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, is accused of second-degree murder
in the death of Lisa. He has not been charged with beating Nussbaum,
his live-in companion, who was bruised and had a broken nose when
the couple was arrested.
   In earlier testimony about the night of Nov. 1, Nussbaum said
that Steinberg had asked her and the girl whether they had drunk
enough water that day. Nussbaum said she hadn't, and Steinberg,
apparently annoyed, took them into the kitchen.
   ``We went into the kitchen. He took a very hot pepper and cut a
small piece for Lisa and cut off a larger piece and gave it to me,''
she said.
   Asked why he did that, Nussbaum said, ``It made us want to drink
water. It made our mouths hot.'' She said she drank four or five
glasses, as did Lisa.
   A short time later, Nussbaum said, ``Lisa said to me that her
stomach hurt from drinking so much water.''
   The girl then asked if she could go to dinner with Steinberg, and
Nussbaum told her to go into the bedroom and ask Steinberg, she
testified.
   ``The next thing _ it's all hazy _ he came into the bathroom,''
she said. He was carrying the limp body of Lisa.
   Nussbaum, appearing on the brink of weeping, said she asked,
``What happened?''
   According to Nussbaum, Steinberg replied: ``What's the difference
what happened? This is your child. Hasn't this gone far enough?''
   She said she tried various methods to resuscitate the child,
moving her arms and pushing on her chest. Steinberg did nothing to
help, except to say, ``Relax _ go with her. Stay in harmony with
her.''
   Steinberg then left and went to dinner with a friend.
   Steinberg's attorney, Ira London, said after Nussbaum's
testimony: ``I think she was interesting, and parts of her testimony
were moving, but I don't think it was damaging.''
   London added, ``She's not filled in the gaps the district
attorney needs filled in to make a case.''
   Earlier Thursday, State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax said
that Nussbaum would be allowed to testify about alleged brutality at
the hands of Steinberg, but not before she testifies about events
the night Lisa Steinberg was fatally injured.
   Rothwax said a mistrial would result if Nussbaum were to testify
about alleged beatings and so-called ``uncharged crimes'' _ and then
failed to testify about the events of Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, 1987.
   The prosecution compiled a list of 32 incidents of alleged
physical abuse by Steinberg in the past 10 years. The judge said he
would allow the prosecution to ask Nussbaum about five of them.
   The alleged incidents included two eye injuries, a
``life-threatening'' injury in 1981 that required the removal of her
spleen and one attack in which he threw her on the ground. The most
recent occurred within weeks of Lisa's death, when he allegedly beat
her with an exercise bar.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his wife Nancy have been
invited to Japan after they leave the White House, to receive ``a
national welcome'' from the Japanese people, officials said Thursday.
   During a White House visit Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister
Sousuke Uno renewed an invitation to the Reagans to visit Japan
after the president steps down in January. Reagan expressed
appreciation and said he hopes to travel in the future but has no
firm plans, said a U.S. official who demanded anonymity.
   Leaving the White House, Uno quoted Reagan as saying he intends
to maintain the close personal contact he developed in office with
Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita, the previous and current
Japanese prime ministers.
   Uno gave the president a personal letter from Takeshita and told
Reagan and his successor, Vice President George Bush that Takeshita
hopes to visit Washington early in 1989, said Japanese Foreign
Ministry official Yukio Okamoto.
   Reagan expressed interest in Uno's planned Dec. 19-21 meeting in
Tokyo with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, telling the
Japanese minister he should be able to handle Soviet relations well
since he had lived in a Soviet camp for two years, Okamoto said.
   Uno replied that the fact that he was a detention camp internee
at the end of World War II ``does not influence his decisions as a
public official, and as foreign minister he deals with the Soviet
Union on a very fair basis,'' Okamoto said.
   Uno said at the State Department on Wednesday that Japan hopes
the thaw in superpower relations will help Japan get back northern
islands occupied by the Soviet Union after World War II.
   Okamoto said Uno also told the president that Japan would
coordinate policy with the United States at next week's global trade
talks in Montreal.
   Uno told the president that ``from the standpoint of promoting
the free trade system, he would coordinate with the United States in
order to assure success in the round'' of trade talks, Okamoto said.

   An Israeli who was linked to the U.S.
Iran-Contra affair and who briefed Vice President George Bush on
arms deals with Iran apparently died in a plane crash while
traveling under an assumed name, officials said Thursday.
   The man was tentatively identified by a passport found on his
body as Amiram Nir Nisker, a former adviser on counter-terrorism to
two Israeli prime ministers, said a statement from the Michoacan
state attorney general's office.
   Nir's former newspaper colleagues in Israel said Thursday his
name was Nisker before he changed it to Nir. They gave his age as 38.
   The pilot of the Cessna T210 also was killed in the crash
Wednesday in western Michoacan state and two people were badly hurt,
the Mexican statement said. It said engine failure may have been the
cause.
   Officials and sources in Israel, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Nir was in Mexico on a business trip, but would not
disclose its nature.
   Nir was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving sale
of U.S. weapons to Iran, according to testimony heard by U.S.
congressional investigators. Nir's activities included trips to
Tehran, the capital of Iran, and Western Europe.
   Former White House aide Oliver North, who was deeply involved in
the transactions, suggested during congressional testimony that the
Contra link _ diverting funds from U.S. arms sales to Iran to
Nicaraguan rebels _ was Nir's idea. Israel denied it.
   Nir was sought for questioning by Special U.S. Prosecutor
Lawrence E. Walsh. Israel insisted Nir be granted immunity from
prosecution.
   The state attorney general's statement said Nir's passport was
issued in Tel Aviv and contained a Mexican visa issued by the
Mexican Embassy in London on Nov. 25.
   It said the passenger carrying the passport had registered as Pat
Weber for the flight, prompting authorities to pursue their
investigations for a positive identification.
   The plane, belonging to the Aerotaxis of Uruapan line, took off
from Uruapan Wednesday afternoon and crashed on a ranch near Rio del
Salto, near Ciudad Hidalgo, 30 minutes later, the statement said.
   Ciudad Hidalgo lies 110 miles west of Mexico City.
   ``According to preliminary reports, the plane crashed ... because
of an engine failure, obliging the pilot to try an emergency
landing,'' the statement said.
   It identified the dead pilot as Pedro Espinoza Hurtado, 34, and
the injured as Guillermo Joaonde Amezqua, 35, and Ester Areaga, 23.
   Cmdr. Arturo Martinez, an airport official in Uruapan, said the
flight plan showed the Cessna was bound for Mexico City.
   Sources in Israel said Israeli Embassy officials were traveling
from Mexico City to the crash site for positive identification of
Nir.
   Nir was a close associate of Shimon Peres, now foreign minister
of Israel. He rose to prominence after Peres became prime minister
and named him adviser on counter-terrorism in 1985.
   Nir remained on after Shamir succeeded Peres as prime minister in
October 1986, and the Iran-Contra affair exploded that November.
Israeli reports, however, said Shamir deprived him of any tasks.
   According to news reports, Shamir resisted pressure to fire Nir
last year, fearing such a move would be interpreted as an admission
of wrongdoing in the Iran weapons affair.
   Nir resigned this year.
   Israeli leaders admitted selling weapons to Iran but insisted
they acted only in cooperation with the United States. Israel also
denied any knowledge of the Contra connection.
   The Iran-Contra case rocked the Reagan administration.
   One major issue was that officials in the Reagan administration
were secretly selling arms to the revolutionary government of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran while Washington was criticizing
other countries for selling arms to Iran.
   Another issue was the disclosure that funds from the arms sales
were diverted to the Contras despite congressional measures that
barred military aid to the Contras.
   Peres, who was prime minister from 1984-86, assigned Nir in
December 1985 to serve as liaison with North.
   In that capacity, Nir met with North in Israel, Europe and the
United States, discussing U.S. arms sales to Iran through Israel and
the diversion of profits to the Contras.
   Nir also traveled to Tehran in May 1986 with North and former
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to discuss the release of
American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon in
return for the supply of anti-aircraft Hawk missiles.
   Nir briefed Bush on the program involving selling U.S. weapons to
Iran at a meeting the two men had in Jerusalem on July 27, 1986.
Bush has said he does not remember much about the briefing, but his
aide Craig Fuller also attended the meeting and took notes. Fuller,
now co-director of the Bush transition office, was then the chief of
staff for the vice president.
   Nir, who lost an eye in a car crash in his youth, was a
journalist and military commentator before turning to politics and
joining Peres' 1984 campaign. He was married and had two children.
   Nir intervened in the Iran-Contra affair in late 1985, squeezing
out Israeli arms dealers Yakov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer. In January
1986, he met in Washington with North and Adm. John Poindexter, a
national Security adviser, and proposed to renew arms shipments to
Iran.
   According to testimony taken by congressional investigators, Nir
became an important liaison in the arms deals to Iran and passed
himself off on his trips abroad as an American named Miller.
   Until October 1986, Nir controlled most of the U.S. access to the
Iranians through Iranian-born middleman Manucher Ghorbanifar. North
then tried to push Nir to a ``supporting role.'' According to
North's testimony, Nir constantly insisted on overcharging the
Iranians for U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa congratulated
government officials Thursday for a ``courageous'' decision to let
him speak uncensored on television, and said he hoped it bodes well
for future talks.
   Walesa got dozens of phone calls and more than 100 congratulatory
telegrams after his Wednesday night TV debate with the government
union chief, Alfred Miodowicz, Solidarity spokesmen said. A banner
saying ``Bravo, Lech'' was hung on the Warsaw University campus
Thursday.
   Supporters felt Walesa, a founder of the outlawed free trade
union movement, won the unprecedented debate and senior advisers
celebrated into the night.
   Walesa spoke to foreign and official Polish journalists at St.
Brygida's Church in his home city of Gdansk following his triumphant
return.
   ``I don't know who made the decision (to allow his appearance on
state-controlled TV), but I have to admit that this person was
courageous,'' . Walesa said, according to a TV videotape recording
of his remarks by ABC News.
   ``Knowing what I represent, this is a heroic decision and can
give cause for hope (for future talks.).''
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, praised TV producers for
an accurate program.
   ``I can say the television was honest and all right. This time
television behaved as it should be in the world, and I am nicely
surprised,'' said Walesa, wearing a red turtle neck sweater he said
he needed to protect a sore throat.
   He appeared in an ebullient mood and briefly put on a boxing
glove offered him by a Polish reporter.
   The 43-minute debate was Walesa's first appearance on Polish TV
in five years and his longest appearance ever.
   He vigorously defended Solidarity's right to exist and said the
official trade unions should join Solidarity in ``creating freedom.''
   Official mass media on Thursday prominently reported the debate,
but avoided much discussion of its content or any comment on who
won. However, Polish newspapers for apparently the first time in
seven years ran photographs of Walesa on their front pages, standing
next to Miodowicz at the TV studio.
   ``Last night's television meeting of Miodowicz and Walesa
gathered a record audience. ... Everybody came (to watch), even
those who are apathetic,'' said a commentator on the early evening
news.
   ``The meeting was successful, but there are no words that can do
something in Poland. We need acts ... Basing the reform on
television talks only will give us nothing,'' sociology professor
Andrzej Tymowski was quoted as saying by the Express Wieczorny
newspaper in Warsaw.

   Police dogs found a fifth body
Thursday, apparently that of a woman, in a search along two highways
in southeastern Massachusetts that was prompted by the discovery of
four women's bodies.
   The clothed and decomposed remains were found around 3:30 p.m.
near Freetown, off of Route 140, less than three miles from the site
where the first body was discovered in July, said Thomas Gibney of
the Bristol County district attorney's office.
   Gibney said authorities would continue the search. He said the
officer who found the body told him that it was appeared to be a
woman. No other details were available.
   District Attorney Ronald A. Pina has expressed fears that the
deaths are related and linked to the disappearance of several women
from the Weld Square area, known by police as a center for local
drug trading and prostitution.
   ``There are things that are not coincidence, that are in
common,'' Pina said after the fifth body was found.
   Authorities said the bodies of three women were found near the
same Interstate 195 exit in Dartmouth, and a fourth body was
discovered near Freetown, about 10 miles away.
   State Trooper Jose Gonsalves said one of the victims was
strangled and the cause of death in the other four cases is not
known. He and several other authorities discouraged early reports of
a possible serial killer.
   But there were strong similarities in the cases, the county
prosecutor said.
   ``I feel pretty confident they are connected somehow,'' Pina said.
   Two bodies were discovered in July, one in Dartmouth and the
other in Freetown. Last month, a third body was discovered near the
Dartmouth interstate exit.
   A search for more bodies began Monday when Connecticut state
police provided two dogs trained to search for bodies. On Tuesday,
the dogs found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman along the
interstate in Dartmouth. None of the women has been positively
identified.
   On Wednesday, a dog from Massachusetts state police joined the
search.
   Authorities are checking dental records of five women reported
missing in recent months to see if they match any of the bodies.
Three of the missing women were last seen or lived near or
frequented the Weld Square area.
   Jimmy Giammalvo, whose family has run a grocery store on Weld
Square since 1922, said he hadn't seen much change since the first
body was found. ``They (prostitutes) come in and out of here all the
time. It's business as usual,'' he said.
   After three days searching the Dartmouth area, the searchers
moved to along Route 140 in Freetown and Lakeville, near where the
body was found in July.
   Pina said he believes one person may have killed the three women
whose bodies were found in Dartmouth, and that the person was
familiar with the area.
   ``I personally don't believe it could have been someone traveling
through,'' he said. ``It looks like it was someone who was more
local, someone who knew the area, someone who felt confident enough
that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave.''

   Yugoslavia rejected on Thursday an
Australian ultimatum to turn over a consulate guard accused of
shooting and wounding a demonstrator in Sydney, an official report
said.
   The diplomatic wrangle arose after a 16-year-old was shot in the
throat Sunday during a demonstration by about 1,500 Croatians
outside the Yugoslav consulate.
   Consulate officials refused to surrender the guard accused of
shooting the boy.
   Australia said Thursday the consulate will be closed down and its
staff expelled if he was not turned over by Friday evening.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar summoned Australian Charge
d'Affaires Peter Shannon on Thursday and asked Australia to
re-examine its ultimatum, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug said.
   If not, Yugoslavia will react ``with adequate measures,'' Loncar
was quoted as saying. Tanjug did not say what these would be.
   Yugoslavia defended the guard's action, saying he ``had no choice
but, shooting into the air, to warn Australian authorities . ..
lives and security of workers in the consulate and their families
were directly imperiled.''
   Yugoslav officials said Australia failed to protect the consulate
from the protesters, whom they called ``fascist pro-Utasha emigres.''
   The Ustashas were Croatian fascists who teamed with Nazi Germany
in opposing Yugoslav resistance forces during World War II.
   Croatian extremists have been accused of killing at least two
Yugoslav diplomats abroad and wounding others in attacks over the
past 20 years.
   A group of 19 Ustashas, said to have been trained in Australia,
infiltrated Yugoslavia in 1972. Most were killed by Yugoslav
security forces, but 13 troops also died.
   Tanjug said Yugoslavia expects Australian officials ``to identify
and punish terrorist attackers.''
   However, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans says his
government has enough evidence to prosecute the guard.

   A woman who testified against an accused police
killer at his 1977 trial told a judge Thursday that a filmmaker
coached her to make inaccurate statements in a documentary which
questions the man's conviction.
   The filmmaker said the woman has ``no credibility.''
   Emily Blocker testified Thursday in a hearing at which Randall
Dale Adams is asking a judge to recommend a retrial of his murder
case. After hearing evidence, state District Judge Larry Baraka will
tell the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals whether he believes Adams
deserves a new trial.
   Much of the material being presented in the retrial request was
in the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``This man came into my house and told me he was going to make a
movie about a police shooting in Dallas,'' Ms. Blocker said of
filmmaker Errol Morris.
   ``I said I don't exactly remember how everything went down. He
said `What the heck? It's just a movie. Anything you don't remember,
I'll remember for you,''' Ms. Blocker said.
   In the trial following the 1976 murder of policeman Robert Wood,
Ms. Blocker told the judge she identified Adams in a lineup. The
documentary, though, quoting investigators and interviewing Ms.
Blocker, notes that she chose someone else in the lineup.
   ``Did you lie to the judge (during the murder trial)?'' defense
attorney Randy Schaffer asked her Thursday.
   ``I guess I didn't understand the (judge's) question,'' Ms.
Blocker said.
   Morris, during a recess in Thursday's testimony, told reporters
that Ms. Blocker's inability to identify Adams in the police lineup
would throw into doubt her identification of Adams at his trial and
her testimony.
   Morris said Ms. Blocker ``has no credibility whatsoever'' and
said unedited filmed interviews show she was interviewed ``without
coaching and without influence to say anything whatsoever.''
   Ms. Blocker also said she believed a lack of evidence, not any
agreement with attorney Doug Mulder, who prosecuted Adams in the
murder trial, led to dismissal of a robbery charge against her
daughter.
   The charge was dropped five days after Adams was sentenced for
the police shooting, Schaffer said.
   Ms. Blocker said her daughter's case ``has nothing to do with
this case. I don't ask for favors.''
   John Danish, who represented Ms. Blocker's daughter in the
robbery case, acknowledged under questioning from Schaffer that, in
his opinion, there was enough evidence for the robbery case to go to
the jury and that he has seen people sentenced to prison with less
evidence.
   ``I don't believe Emily ... ever came out and told me she had a
quid-pro-quo arrangement with Doug Mulder ... I can say she gave the
impression this case I was working on was nothing to worry about,''
Danish said.
   On Wednesday, the first day of the hearing, prisoner David Ray
Harris recanted his 1977 testimony that Adams killed Wood. Harris
was the only known witness to the slaying.
   Although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder,
Harris said his finger was on the trigger of the .22-caliber gun
that killed Wood.
   Harris, a death row inmate in connection with an unrelated
killing, said Adams ``knew nothing about this offense and was not in
the car at the time (Wood was shot).''

   The state Senate ended a special session
Thursday, ignoring a midnight deadline to enact legislation on an
agreement for the state to buy and dismantle the Shoreham nuclear
power plant.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo has maintained that the Long Island Lighting Co.
plant should not be allowed to open because Long Island couldn't be
safely evacuated in the event of a serious nuclear accident.
   Long Island residents were concerned that their electrical rates
might soar under the state plan.
   State Assembly members headed home before the Senate's
adjournment, apparently convinced that the upper chamber would
refuse to deal with the Shoreham agreement.
   The leader of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Speaker Mel
Miller, said his members wouldn't approve any Shoreham bill that the
Senate hadn't agreed to.
   The Senate wouldn't back a Shoreham measure because nine senators
from Long Island, all Republicans, felt the agreement as written
would be too generous to LILCO and raise rates for the utility's
customers.
   The takeover of the completed power plant was approved by
stockholders of Long Island Lighting, better known as LILCO, and the
utility's board set a deadline for state approval in the middle of
November. When that date passed, it was extended to Dec. 1.
   LILCO spokesman James Lois said the utility's board of directors
had called a meeting for Friday in Hicksville to discuss ``our
future course regarding the settlement.'' He would not speculate
what options LILCO might consider.
   Cuomo had said that if the deal died, Shoreham could get an
operating license from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission as
early as Dec. 12.
   The deal, worked out by LILCO and Cuomo's aides in June, called
for the state to buy the $5.3 billion power plant for $1 and
dismantle it. In return, the utility would get guaranteed rate hikes
over the next decade totaling more than 60 percent.
   Cuomo said LILCO customers would find their rates going up by 100
percent over the next decade if the agreement wasn't approved and
the Shoreham plant went into operation.
   The state, through the New York Power Authority, would build
non-nuclear power plants to provide LILCO with the electricity it
would lose without Shoreham, the deal stipulated.

   The wife of a New Jersey mayor and another
woman were killed Thursday when their one-car tourist train derailed
high in the Andes and tumbled down an embankment, officials said.
   Eight people, including Jersey City, N.J., Mayor Anthony Cucci,
were injured.
   Jersey City Councilman Jaime Vasquez, who initially reported the
derailment to the U.S. Embassy, told reporters he suffered only
minor bruises.
   Police said they were investigating reports that the tracks may
have been sabotaged in connection with a general labor strike that
was affecting the nation Thursday.
   They said steel rods were found near the derailment site and
might have been purposely placed on the tracks to cause an accident.
   The single-car train, a bus outfitted to travel over rails,
derailed about six miles outside Cuzco, a tourist mecca 355 miles
southeast of Lima in the Andes Mountains, police said.
   They said the vehicle derailed, traveled about 30 feet, went off
a cliff and plunged 250 feet before coming to a stop.
   Killed were Anna Cucci, about 60, and Doris Chacon, 58, wife of
Cuzco Mayor Carlos Chacon, local police said.
   Dr. Luis Garcia, director of Cuzco's Regional Hospital, said
Cucci, who is about 65, was in stable condition with multiple
bruises.
   He said Chacon was in serious condition suffering from multiple
fractures and internal bleeding.
   The conditions of the train driver and three policemen aboard
were not immediately known.
   The train had left Cuzco 45 minutes earlier on a special
sightseeing trip to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, about
60 miles northwest of Cuzco, police said.
   Police said some of the passengers apparently were able to escape
from the vehicle before it went over the cliff.
   Garcia said preliminary reports indicated Mrs. Cucci and Mrs.
Chacon died of skull fractures. An autopsy was scheduled for Friday.
   The Cuccis arrived in Cuzco on Thursday morning and planned to
participate in a sister city celebration honoring Jersy City and
Cuzco.
   A larger tourist train with several cars daily carries dozens of
tourists, many from the United States and Europe, between Cuzco and
Machu Picchu.
   This was the first report of a serious accident involving the
route since a bomb exploded on it in June 1986. Eight people were
killed, including an American.

   Thousands of Palestinian
children streamed to West Bank elementary schools Thursday after the
army lifted an order that shut down classes for most of 10 months.
   There were no reports of violence at the 612 private, state and
U.N.-run schools attended by about 230,000 first-through-sixth
graders.
   But elsewhere Thursday, a Palestinian teen-ager was killed and 15
Arabs were wounded when troops opened fire at rock-throwing
demonstrators in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital
officials said.
   Near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Pisgat Zeev, an Israeli
driver was attacked with stones, lost control of his car and crashed
into an electricity pole, Israel radio said. He was reported to
suffer only slight injuries.
   The 17-year-old Palestinian was killed in the West Bank village
of Kifin, north of Jenin, when soldiers searching for protesters
opened fire after they were attacked with stones and a fire bomb, an
army statement said.
   The latest death raised to at least 317 the number of
Palestinians killed since they launched their uprising against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven
Israelis also have died.
   Among the wounded was a 10-year-old boy from Deir Balah refugee
camp south of Gaza City, said the hospital officials, who demanded
anonymity. They said the boy, identified as Hamad Hassan Abu Dan,
was in critical condition with a bullet wound in his chest and was
transferred to Barzilai hospital in Israel for further treatment.
   The army confirmed that four Palestinians were wounded in clashes
in the central market of the West Bank city of Nablus and said it
was checking the other reports of wounded.
   The start of elementary school classes was the first step in the
army's three-stage opening of 1,194 West Bank schools, closed for
all but a few weeks since Feb. 3. Junior high schools will open Dec.
11 and high schools Dec. 18.
   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military
administration, said there was no guarantee the schools would remain
open.
   ``We have made the opening conditional on the schools being used
for learning and not to create demonstrations,'' Erez said on army
radio. ``We have no guarantees that everything will go smoothly.''
   The army closed the schools in February after charging they were
a breeding ground for anti-Israeli demonstrations.
   West Bank universities and colleges are to remain closed
indefinitely.
   The 365 schools attended by 175,000 students in the Gaza Strip
have been open, although there have been sporadic closures.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, nine miles north of Jerusalem,
children greeted one another happily in the schoolyard of the
Quaker-run Friends Boys School as it opened at 7:30 a.m.
   ``They were excited, perhaps more about meeting each other than
about being back in class,'' principal Khalil Mahshi said.
   Most fourth graders in an English class at the Friends School
said they were glad to be back in school.
   ``I missed school because I didn't see my friends. I studied at
home, but it wasn't the same,'' said 9-year-old Eric Kapenga.
   Ahmed Boshnah, also 9, said he had no difficulty getting up for
school Thursday even though classes started half an hour earlier to
compensate for school ending at noon instead of 1 p.m., in
compliance with PLO-issued strike orders.
   ``At home, I played a lot and watched TV. But I don't miss it. It
got boring,'' Boshnah said.
   Sam Awwad, 11, disagreed, glancing disparagingly at his
sixth-grade science text.
   ``I'd rather be throwing rocks at the Jews,'' said Awwad.
   Principal Mahshi said school attendance Thursday was about 150
students, down considerably from last year's 200 elementary pupils.
   ``In the upper grades, the loss will be even greater,'' added
Mahshi. He said this year's class of graduating seniors would number
just seven, compared to 33 before the school closure.
   The sharp drop in enrollment was due to Arab-American students
leaving for schools in the United States and hundreds of West Bank
students enrolling in schools in Jerusalem during the prolonged
closure, Mahshi said.
   Tourism Ministry officials, meanwhile, announced that religious
Christmas celebrations would take place in the West Bank town of
Bethlehem as scheduled.
   The statement came after Palestinian municipal officials said
earlier this week they were canceling city-run Christmas activities
in solidarity with the Palestinian uprising.
   The Palestinian decision means there won't be an annual reception
for Arab and Israeli dignitaries, a Christmas eve Boy Scout parade
or decorations in city streets.
   The Tourism Ministry plans to stage its annual international
choir festival and other events.

<HEAD>Delta Tightens Crew Guidelines; Engineer Says Warning Switch
Corroded</HEAD>

   Delta Air Lines imposed tighter guidelines
for cockpit conduct Thursday and a federal panel probing the crash
of Flight 1141 learned of occasional lapses in communication and
procedure on Delta flight decks.
   Delta officials said they had planned to issue the new guidelines
before the National Transportation Safety Board began its public
hearing this week into the Aug. 31 crash of the flight upon takeoff
from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Fourteen of the 108
people on the plane died.
   Marion Dittman, who led a team that conducted a special safety
audit of the Atlanta-based carrier in 1987, told the panel Thursday
that Delta's policy a year ago was to give pilots ``maximum
discretion'' in control of the cockpit.
   ``We were surprised at some of the things we found,'' Ms. Dittman
said.
   ``There is no evidence Delta's crew are (on the whole) either
unprofessional or purposely negligent,'' the report said. ``Rather,
it was observed that crew members are frequently acting as
individuals rather than as members of smoothly running teams.''
   The report cited some Delta captains' passive leadership, under
which fellow flight officers often ``proceeded on the assumption
that they knew what the captain wanted,'' and led to
misunderstandings, oversights and errors.
   Ms. Dittman also told the board that a followup survey in
November showed Delta was making ``great strides'' in tightening its
regulations.
   The revised regulations will require crew members to call out
items that have been cleared on a checklist.
   Earlier this week at the NTSB hearing, Flight 1141 Capt. Larry
Davis testified he had used hand gestures to signal his progress
through the checklist.
   Ken Adams, a flight instructor, told the panel Thursday that one
major change on crew members' flight checklists will be to look at
the wing flaps twice.
   ``We started deploying them (the flaps) as soon as we go so the
public can see them and say they're down,'' he said.
   The wing flaps have been the focus of much of the panel's
investigation.
   Investigators have been puzzled that the plane's flap handle was
found up, the retracted position, although some of the plane's flaps
and slats were extended.
   A switch for a system that would have warned the pilots of Delta
Air Lines Flight 1141 that the jet's wing flaps were improperly set
for takeoff had corroded, a veteran engineer told federal
investigators Thursday.
   NTSB officials say the hearing is only for fact-gathering and
that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public
in six months.
   All three crew members agreed before the board that, to the best
of their recollection, they made all necessary preflight
preparations, including setting the flaps, although they may have
bent several Delta regulations.
   One of their admitted technical violations was allowing a flight
attendant into the cockpit during a long delay before takeoff.

   FMC Corp., a defense manufacturer, knowingly
shipped defective Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the U.S. Army, which
accepted them even though it was warned about the problems, ABC News
reported Thursday.
   The ``ABC World News Tonight'' report came the day after FMC
filed suit in Chicago against ABC News to regain what the company
said were stolen documents used for an earlier story on alleged
parts overcharges for the Bradley.
   ``FMC has brought suit against ABC charging that we are
wrongfully in possession of FMC documents,'' anchorman Peter
Jennings said Thursday at the beginning of the Bradley segment. ``At
ABC News we say that's not true.''
   In Thursday's report, the network said it had obtained a
government memo in which a Defense Department quality assurance
inspector cited the Chicago-based builder for a faulty mechanism
that was supposed to help the Bradley float.
   According to the memo, the problem was not fixed by FMC and the
vehicle, which resembles a tank, was shipped to the Army, ABC
reported.
   Critics of the Bradley, which has been deployed mostly in Europe,
content the vehicle doesn't work and is unsafe. By last December,
FMC had delivered about 3,100 Bradleys at a cost of $10 billion. ABC
says the cost of the Bradley program has reached $11.3 billion.
   ``There was never a vehicle that left here that didn't have
multiple defects on it,'' Jesse Ringstaff, one of the government
inspectors who worked on the Bradley at the FMC plant in Santa
Clara, Calif., told ABC.
   Ringstaff, asked by ABC if the defects could have been dangerous
to soldiers riding in the vehicle, said, ``Of course, it could.''
   After FMC shipped the Bradleys to the Army, a few were supposed
to be tested. But the Army and FMC were not enthusiastic about
performing the tests, Air Force Col. James Burton, the Pentagon's
key Bradley tester at the time, told ABC.
   ``I had a three-star general tell me that we don't want to test
because we know it may blow up and then that will just cause a stink
and so we really don't want that to happen,'' he said.
   According to an unidentified FMC engineer, workers installed
flawed metal armor on certain Bradleys and in some cases the layered
metal delaminated, the network reported. ``That is an extremely
dangerous condition,'' he said.
   In another memo obtained by ABC News, government inspectors found
FMC had removed parts from Bradleys after they had passed inspection
and then placed those parts on other Bradleys still to be inspected.
   ABC News said FMC declined to discuss the Bradley on camera.
   Although FMC and the Army allegedly were unenthusiastic about
testing the vehicle, eventually it was tested and flaws were
uncovered. Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress they
planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent
``more survivable'' in battle.
   But ABC reports that many flawed vehicles still remain in the
field.
   It also reported that former members of the Army's senior staff
now work for FMC. It said Gen. Edward C. Meyer, the Army chief of
staff at the time the first Bradleys came off the assembly line,
took a position on FMC's board of directors three months after he
retired from the Army in June 1983.
   In 1986, Meyer was paid about $128,000 by FMC, ABC reported. He
declined to talk to the network.
   Col. David Doyle, who oversaw production of the Bradley at the
FMC plant, retired from the Army in 1981 and a few days later he
went to work for the company, ABC reported. He also declined to talk
to the network.
   On Oct. 20, ABC aired the story that quoted unidentified former
FMC employees who accused the company of overcharging the government
for spare parts on the vehicle.
   ``We don't know how they got the documents,'' said Pat Brozowski,
spokeswomen for FMC. An in-house investigation of the television
story ``turned up the fact that the documents were missing from our
files,'' she said.
   FMC also said it has told the government's General Accounting
Office it will cooperate with any investigation of prices charged on
the Bradley parts, according to the statement.

   President Reagan hailed departing Rep. Jack
Kemp on Thursday night as an indispensable conservative ally who
fired ``solid gold bullets'' in Congress on behalf of Reagan's
tax-cut programs.
   In remarks at a testimonial dinner for the New York congressman
who is leaving office in January, Reagan called Kemp ``one of the
deputies'' who helped him institute supply-side economics when he
came to power in 1981.
   He called Kemp an unstinting fighter for conservative values, and
said President-elect George Bush will need only to ``sound the
trumpet'' when he needs support and ``the great army of idealists
and activists we have counted on will be ready to charge.''
   Reagan noted that Kemp was a principal sponsor of the so-called
Kemp-Roth bill to cut marginal tax rates by 30 percent, which was
introduced in Congress in 1977. He also said that ``our ideas were
relegated to the fringe'' in Washington until the landmark
legislation cutting tax rates was passed in 1981.
   ``When you talk about Jack, one word comes to mind: the cause,''
Reagan said. ``Wherever he is, he will fight for that cause, he will
work for that cause, and what unites every single person in this
room is our shared commitment to that cause.''
   ``Jack is fond of saying that this administration gave America
back to its future,'' the president said. ``If I can return the
compliment, Jack, I would just like to say that your ideas helped
fuel us to go further into the future than we ever dreamed
possible.''
   ``He helped to settle a tough frontier _ the Congress _ loading
his six-gun with solid gold bullets,'' Reagan said.
   James Baker III, the former treasury secretary who is now
Secretary of State-designate for the Bush administration, told the
dinner, ``What some of us thought might be `voodoo economics' really
turned out to be `can-do economics.''' Baker was George Bush's
campaign manager in 1980 when Bush charged that the tax cuts favored
by Reagan and Kemp amounted to ``voodoo economics.''
   Kemp will head a newly created Institute for Free Enterprise
Development after he leaves office.

   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived
Thursday as his nation's first high-level envoy to the Soviet
capital in 31 years.
   He will be meeting Soviet officials to seek agreement on the
conflict in Cambodia and prepare for a 1989 summit.
   The summit would be the first since 1959 when Nikita S.
Khrushchev met Chinese leader Mao Tse-Tung in Beijing. Qian's visit
is the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the visit of Chou
En-lai in 1957.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze greeted him at
Moscow's Sheremetyevo 2 Airport. They are to conduct two days of
talks, and the Chinese official said he also expected to meet with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``China and the Soviet Union, as two great neighboring countries,
must live in peace and neighborly relations,'' Qian said in an
arrival statement distributed by the Soviet news agency Tass.
   ``We are glad that in recent years Chinese-Soviet relations
gradually are improving,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Relations between the two communist powers soured in the early
1960s in a struggle over the direction of world communism. They
reached a low point in 1969, when each side sent at least 1 million
soldiers to the border and fought a short frontier war.
   However, Gorbachev has made several recent overtures to China,
ordering a pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, reducing
Soviet troops on the Chinese border, and agreeing to direct talks on
the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia.
   In late October, officials announced that negotiators had reached
agreement settling most Soviet-Chinese differences over the eastern
part of their common boundary.
   China wants the Soviet Union to use its influence to force
Vietnamese soldiers out of Cambodia, where they have been fighting
Chinese-backed rebels for the past decade.
   The dispute has been the main stumbling block to a Soviet-Chinese
summit.
   Tass said Shevardnadze and Qian spent much of their time in their
first meeting Thursday dicussing that dispute.
   Qian indicated the summit was a virtual certainty, regardless of
progress on the Cambodian issue. Gorbachev is expected to go to
Beijing for the summit because China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping
is 84 years old and rarely travels abroad.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters
earlier that Shevardnadze would make a return visit to China.

   Three bombs exploded in Athens early Friday
a few hours before the opening of the European Economic Community
summit this weekend on the Greek island of Rhodes, police reported.
No injures were reported.
   One blast was at the Athens office of the EEC.
   The other two explosions were at the offices of the Greek
Investment Bank in central Athens and at the offices of the Hellenic
Management Institute in the capital's northern suburb of Kifissia.
   All three offices were empty and nobody was hurt in the
explosions, said a police spokesman who was not identified in
keeping with Greek practice.
   No details were immediately available about the extent of damage.
   The spokesman said an anonymous caller telephoned two Athens
left-wing newspapers with a warning 10 minutes before the blasts,
which occurred between 1:15 a.m. and 1:35 a.m.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. But the spokesman
said police believe a group called the Popular Revolutionary
Struggle carried out the bombings.
   ELA, as the leftist group is known, has claimed responsibility
for more than 100 explosions since 1975, many at the premises of
Greek public services.
   Political leaders of the 12 EEC states are gathering in Rhodes in
the southern Aegean Sea about 270 miles southeast of Athens for the
start of the summit meeting Saturday. Greece currently holds the
rotating six-month presidency of the EEC.

<HEAD>Murder Trial For Three Polygamist Clan Members To Begin Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COALVILLE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for three polygamist clan
members charged with killing a state law officer say their case will
center on psychological stress from police floodlights and
loudspeakers.
   An eight-member jury and two alternates were empaneled Thursday
and opening arguments were to begin Friday in the trial of clan
leader Addam Swapp, 27, his brother Jonathan Swapp, 21, and
brother-in-law John Timothy Singer, 22.
   All are charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 28 death of
Corrections Lt. Fred House.
   House was killed during a brief shootout that ended a standoff
between the clan and 100 officers fearful of storming the rural
compound because of the clan's nine children. The impasse had begun
13 days before when Addam Swapp bombed a nearby Mormon chapel.
   Prosecutors contend it was the wheelchair-bound Singer who fired
the fatal shot, but he told officers later that he was aiming at
dogs and never intended to harm anyone.
   Addam Swapp's attorney, John Bucher, said the defense would place
``more of an emphasis on the psychological state'' of the
defendants. During much of the standoff authorities aimed
floodlights and recordings of high-pitched sirens at the 15 clan
members inside the compound.
   Prosecutors are expected to duplicate much of the evidence
presented during a federal trial last spring in which the Swapp
brothers, Singer and his mother, Vickie Singer, were convicted of
bombing and related charges.
   Swapp, an excommunicated Mormon, admitted planting 87 sticks of
dynamite at the Kamas Stake Center. He said he was divinely inspired
to bomb the chapel to signal the impending collapse of church and
state and to trigger the return of Vickie Singer's late husband,
John Singer.
   Before jury selection began, District Judge Michael Murphy issued
a 25-page, 276-question survey asking the 250 potential jurors
whether they were active members of the Mormon Church, if they
attended services at the Marion chapel and whether they associated
with any organized polygamous group.
   On Wednesday, Murphy agreed to allow attorneys to question
prospective jurors about whether they believed in divine revelation.
   The judge said he would not reject members of The Church of
Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints who believe their faith's
president, Ezra Taft Benson, is a prophet who receives divine
revelations.
   The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Jack Kemp, whose name is on the tax cut
that was the heart of Reaganomics, says he's hoping President-elect
George Bush will give him a platform to keep spreading the word.
   In an interview Thursday, Kemp said he would welcome an
appointment to the National Economic Commission, the bipartisan
panel charged with making recommendations for reducing the federal
budget deficit.
   The 53-year-old Republican from New York is leaving the House
after 18 years, having given up his seat when he bid unsuccessfully
for the GOP presidential nomination.
   Kemp says he's looking forward to spending a couple of years
working for a Washington research organization and making $15,000
speeches. Bt, with an eye toward perhaps a future run for the White
House, he also wants to stay active in public policy.
   ``I'm interested in being a trouble shooter for George Bush,''
Kemp said. ``I'd like to make his administration a success.''
   ``I would be interested in helping George Bush prove his case for
a flexible freeze and economic growth'' to reduce the deficit, as an
alternative to tax increases, he said.
   Kemp was being honored Thursday night at a dinner hosted by two
conservative ``think tanks,'' the Heritage Foundation and the
Institute for Free Enterprise Development.
   President Reagan praised Kemp as a conservative torchbearer.
``Wherever he is, he will fight for that cause, he will work for
that cause, and what unites every single person in this room is our
shared commitment to that cause,'' said Reagan.
   But Bush so far isn't saying if he wants Kemp as part of his
team. Asked about an economic commission appointment on Thursday,
Bush brushed the question aside.
   Kemp was an author of the Kemp-Roth income tax cut of 1981, and
his appointment to the commission would underline Bush's ``read my
lips'' pledge of no new taxes.
   But ``When we're busy reading lips these days, we'll do well to
remember that Jack, his lips move first and they move fastest. And
if I know him, they're going to keep on moving,'' said Bush of Kemp
during Thursday night's tribute.
   However, Kemp's appointment to the commission might deepen doubts
in the financial community about Bush's commitment to take strong
action to cut the deficit. Kemp-Roth was based on the theory that
growth would propel the government out of its red ink, but the
budget deficit has risen to record levels since the tax cut was
passed.
   Kemp is seeking appointment to the commission even though he said
earlier this year that the effort should be ``routinely passed into
the dustbin of history.''
   ``I told John Sununu about a week ago that I'd be willing to do
anything they wanted me to do'' to help in the area of trade and
economics, he said. A Cabinet appointment was not necessary, and he
wouldn't take a federal appointment just so he'd still have a title
once his term in Congress ends in January, Kemp said.
   ``I'm not going to be frantic to try to keep some artificial
visibility,'' he said. ``If I were worried, I'd be doing other
things.''
   Kemp said he wouldn't mind being considered for jobs such as
secretary of the treasury, secretary of defense or secretary of
state, but he concedes such positions _ two of which are already
filled _ were not likely. ``I'm not frankly anxious to go into the
Cabinet,'' he said when asked about speculation he was being
considered for secretary of housing and urban development.
   In Congress, Kemp has been out front among Reagan Republicans in
pushing inner-city revitalization, and that makes some consider him
an attractive candidate for the HUD job.
   But others say he's an activist and an advocate, not a bureaucrat.
   ``He's not a detail man at all. He's interested in the big
picture,'' said Michael Evans, a Washington economist.
   Kemp friend Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said, ``The key thing, from my standpoint, is making sure
Jack has an important role as a spokesman and policymaker.''
   Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a conservative ally, said that if Kemp
does not get a Cabinet position the party needs to ``find another
role for him to play so that he continues to provide us leadership.''
   ``He's clearly the leading intellectual House Republican of my
lifetime,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``It's like losing
Theodore Roosevelt. ... He has inspired a whole generation of
younger members.''
   As for an administration appointment, Gingrich said, ``Jack Kemp
is a quarterback. He has to have the ball and run with the ball. If
they're not going to offer him a job that's large enough for his
energy or his drive or his intellect, I think he's better off being
at Heritage.''
   Kemp is joining other Reaganites such as former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III as a distinguished fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, and he has signed on with a Washington speakers' bureau
to book him engagements.
   ``I'm going to continue to speak out, travel and lecture''
whether or not an official appointment comes around, he said.
   Kemp's first career, before entering politics, was as a
professional football quarterback. But he plays down talk that he'd
like to head his career back in that direction and succeed Pete
Rozelle as commissioner of the National Football League.
   Rozelle will probably be around another three or four years, Kemp
says, and besides, ``In 1992, there might be other things doing.''
   ``If I got the opportuity to run again, I'd certainly jump at the
opportunity,'' he said.

   Police tore down barricades of burning tires,
fired tear gas and arrested hundreds of protesters Thursday during
an illegal general strike against government austerity measures,
officials said.
   Police reported arresting 265 people during the daylong strike
that the government had banned.
   Strike leader Valentin Pacho claimed police arrested more than
500 people, most of them when demonstrators tried to march from
surrounding neighborhoods into downtown Lima.
   Authorities said leftist guerrillas seized and burned a city bus.
However, no injuries were reported during the strike.
   It was the fourth general work stoppage this year and the fifth
against the 3-year-old government of President Alan Garcia. The
strike comes during growing unrest caused by Peru's most serious
economic recession this century.
   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva charged the strike was being
manipulated by the Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path to
destabilize and eventually topple the elected government. Labor
leaders denied that.
   At one point, a column of 50 hooded Shining Path guerrillas
marched rapidly across a downtown plaza filled with strikers and
then dispersed in the crowds. Police exploded tear gas canisters and
fired their guns into the air to scatter the protesters.
   Pacho said 80 percent of unionized workers had joined the strike,
but the Labor Ministry claimed 90 percent of Lima's offices,
factories and other businesses were functioning.
   The capital is still reeling from a five-day power outage caused
by leftist guerrillas last week, as well as sporadic water shortages
and growing shortages of basic foods.
   The country has also been hit with a paralyzing mining strike,
that began Oct. 17 and has led to numerous clashes between strikers
and Lima police.
   Labor leaders said the strike was called to protest measures
imposed by the government last week to slow inflation estimated to
reach 2,000 percent this year.
   Gen. Oswaldo Diaz, Lima's top police official, told reporters
``several subversives'' seized and burned a city bus after forcing
passengers out.
   Authorities said 8,000 police maintained order, arresting 78
strikers as they set up roadblocks of burning tires and rubble.
Police quickly tore down the barricades.
   Lima rush hour traffic was lighter than normal with bus
transportation down about 30 percent. Many stores and shops downtown
opened late.
   Pacho said demonstrations were held in Huancayo, Cuzco and
Arequipa. Radio stations reported disturbances in those cities, but
it was unclear how effective the strike was outside Lima.
   Labor is seeking further pay increases following the austerity
measures. The measures raised the minimum monthly wage from 15,000
to 24,000 intis, equivalent to about $50, but more than doubled food
prices and devalued currency 50 percent.

   President-elect George Bush told the new
Democratic leader of the Senate Thursday that he will take the lead
in proposing ways to pare the huge federal budge deficit.
   Faced with calls from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell
and other top Democrats to make the first move on deficit reduction,
Bush said, ``That is exactly what I intend to do'' once he becomes
president.
   ``I am confident that we can work together,'' Bush said as he and
Mitchell faced reporters on the White House driveway after breakfast
together, the latest in a series of culinary goodwill gestures
toward congressional leaders.
   ``I'm not naive about it, nor is he, and there will be different
approaches on some of these major problems facing this country,''
said the vice president. He said he will take the lead on the
deficit ``and then there will be, I'm sure, active discussion ...
negotiation with whoever he designates to try to solve these
problems.''
   Bush also said he won't be rushed into making Cabinet
appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be
troubling to prospects such as John Tower, the former Texas senator
keeping a long vigil for the Pentagon opening.
   ``We're trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to
back up appointments at all levels,'' Bush said.
   Asked about reports of internal strife within his camp over
whether to give the Pentagon post to Tower, a former Senate Armed
Services Committee chairman now a paid consultant to several major
defense contractors, Bush said, ``Any time there seems to be stories
that may be hurtful to somebody it concerns me no matter who it is.
Senator Tower's a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes
a while to go forward.''
   Mitchell said he and Bush did not discuss taxes or any
budget-cutting specifics, but he called the vice president ``keenly
aware of the seriousness of the (deficit) situation.''
   The senator called the discussion ``cordial and productive. ...
He understands that it is his responsibility to proceed first and he
will do so.'' He said Bush deserves time to get his economic team in
place and settle upon a deficit-reduction stratgy.
   The vice president had lunch with President Reagan and joined him
at a meeting with Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter to discuss
next week's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Montreal.
   Bush and Reagan both spoke Thursday night at a testimonial dinner
for retiring Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. In his tribute to Kemp, his
first rival for the GOP nomination, Bush said, ``We're all of us in
your debt and I for one will never forget it.''
   ``When we're busy reading lips these days, we'll do well to
remember that Jack, his lips move first and they move fastest. And
if I know him, they're going to keep on moving,'' Bush said in a
reference to his own campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
   Earlier in the day, Bush brushed aside a question about whether
he would give Kemp the appointment Kemp wants to the National
Economic Commission to fight any proposals to raise taxes. Kemp had
said before the election the panel's work should be ``routinely
passed into the dustbin of history.''
   On Friday, Bush will meet with another former GOP presidential
candidate, Pat Robertson, in the morning before laying out the
welcome mat at his home for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
defeated Democratic presidential nominee, in the afternoon.
   Later Friday, he will receive Argentine President Raul Alfonsin,
whose inauguration he attended five years ago.
   The president-elect said he still has not decided whether he will
send Congress a completely revised version of the fiscal 1990 budget
that Reagan must propose by Jan. 9.
   He said his choice for budget director, Richard Darman, ``has
already begun crunching some of the numbers. As soon as we have our
whole economic team in place ... we'll be in a better position to
answer how I will proceed.''
   But faced with pointed warnings from Mitchell and other top
Democrats that he should not try to lay the burden of
deficit-reduction on them, Bush said he will stick his neck out
first.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said he and Bush also discussed the vice
president's role in next week's meeting in New York with visiting
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. They did not discuss the future
of aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, a constant source of
friction between congressional Democrats and the Reagan
administration.
   ``We all owe to the president-elect the simple courtesy ... to
wait until he has a chance to get his team together and make his
plan,'' Mitchell said.

   The Defense Ministry said a failed
uprising at an army garrison and looting of a Coast Guard arsenal
Thursday reflected military discontent over prosecution of officers
for human rights abuses.
   ``Apparently, by their simultaneity, they were linked,'' defense
spokesman Faustino Altamirano said in a telephone interview. ``It
was not over (low) pay. It was a question of ideology.''
   Fifty-three members of an elite Coast Guard unit tied up three
guards at their base in Olivos, nine miles north of the capital, and
drove off in three trucks. They took with them four machine guns,
200 rifles, 30 handguns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, officials
said.
   Buenos Aires police helicopters searched the main roads, but by
11 p.m. the whereabouts of the raiders still were unknown.
   At the 3rd Infantry Regiment in La Tablada, west of Buenos Aires,
Capt. Jorge Videla, son of imprisoned former President Jorge Videla,
tried to rally soldiers to take over the garrison, Altamirano said.
   The attempt was quelled and Videla arrested.
   A similar incident occurred at an army communications facility in
Citybell, 25 miles south of the capital, and that, too, was put
down, he said.
   President Raul Alfonsin commented earlier Thursday that ``all is
under control'' in Argentina, and ``This is a bunch of rubbish, just
a little problem that took place and is not that important.''
   Alfonsin spoke to The Associated Press in Mexico City. He was
there for the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Altamirano rejected speculation that the motive was low pay.
   In recent months soldiers have been grumbling that their pay
doesn't keep up with 331 percent annual inflation.
   The Coast Guard unit shouted ``Viva Rico!'' as they left their
base in the early hours Thursday, Altamirano said.
   Cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico led short-lived garrison uprisings
against the army command in April 1987 and January 1988 over the
prosecution of military men in civilian courts for human rights
abuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
   ``It doesn't mean he organized it, but it shows they identified
with him,'' Altamirano said.
   At least 9,000 Argentines ``disappeared'' and were presumed
killed during the military's crackdown on suspected leftist
subversives, a commission appointed by Alfonsin reported in 1985.
   Rico is in military prison in Magdalena, 43 miles south of the
capital, as is Videla, the former commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted Videla; former
President Gen. Roberto Viola and three other former junta members
for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder.
   Human rights trials against other officers are resuming after a
lapse of about a year.

<HEAD>Ohio to Announce Fernald Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has agreed to a $1
billion cleanup of a uranium processing plant that has dumped
thousands of pounds of radioactive waste into the environment, state
and federal officials said Thursday.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, state Attorney General Anthony
Celebrezze Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency director Richard
Shank declined to release details of the agreement on the Feed
Materials Production Center in Fernald.
   Formal announcement of the deal was scheduled Friday, the
officials said.
   Gov. Richard Celeste said Wednesday he would not accept any
agreement in which the federal government would not pay the complete
cost of the Fernald cleanup, estimated at $1 billion.
   Steve Wyatt, a DOE spokesman in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said it was
reasonable to assume that the federal government will pay for all of
the cleanup.
   Joe La Grone, manager of Oak Ridge, Tenn., operations, said the
agreement would be a consent decree subject to federal court
approval.
   La Grone said the government will have already spent $355 million
by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and workplace safety efforts
already under way.
   The 37-year-old plant processes and molds uranium for use in the
Energy Department's production of nuclear weapons. which are made at
other locations.
   Production was halted by a strike Oct. 7.
   State and DOE officials had been working toward a cleanup
agreement prior to lawsuits the state filed against the DOE in 1986
and 1987. The talks continued after the lawsuits were filed. Ohio
wants a settlement that would give the state authority to oversee
the cleanup.
   The state blames the DOE for alleged contamination of air and
water at the 1,050-acre plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   The plant sits above the Great Miami River aquifer, a water
source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted the
plant has emitted at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium
dust into the atmosphere during three decades of operation.
   Shank said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from
the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer and create a major
health hazard. Water sampling has not revealed evidence of notable
contamination in regional public water supplies, but monitoring will
continue, Shank told reporters.
   Neighbors have sued the department and its former operator,
National Lead Co. of Ohio, accusing the plant of polluting the
environment with radioactive materials, creating a health hazard and
ruining property values. The lawsuit also is pending in U.S.
District Court.

   A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled
that the Philippine government can sue former President Ferdinand
Marcos and his wife, Imelda for allegedly stealing huge sums from
the country before fleeing.
   The court also maintained a freeze on the couple's suspected
multibillion-dollar worldwide holdings.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Marcos' position as a
former foreign leader did not protect him from lawsuits in U.S.
courts.
   The ``act of state'' doctrine, which prohibits U.S. judicial
review of sovereign acts by another nation, ``is not a promise to
the ruler of any foreign country that his conduct, if challenged by
his own country after his fall, may not become the subject of
scrutiny in our courts,'' said the opinion by Judge John Noonan.
   ``The doctrine is meant to facilitate the foreign relations of
the United States, not to furnish the equivalent of sovereign
immunity to a deposed leader.''
   Noonan said the lawsuit filed by the new Philippine government of
Corazon Aquino has ``a fair chance of succeeding.''
   Marcos, 71, fled Hawaii in February 1986 after a
military-civilian revolt ended his 20-year rule. The couple has been
living in Hawaii since then.
   They were indicted Oct. 21 on criminal racketeering charges
accusing them of plundering the Philippines' treasury and stashing
much of the money in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New York
and was released on $5 million bail. Marcos, who is reportedly in
poor health, has not appeared in court.
   Ronald Olson, a lawyer for the Aquino government, called the
decision to continue a freeze on the Marcoses' holdings ``a
critically important affirmation of the courageous ruling ... which
hopefully has held in place the monies that Marcos has secreted
away.''
   The lawsuit on behalf of the Philippine people contends the
couple used the proceeds of Marcos' alleged looting to invest in
U.S. property, both before and after he was deposed.
   In addition, the lawsuit claims the couple hid other stolen
assets in Swiss banks and elsewhere _ at least $1.5 billion and
perhaps as much as $20 billion, according to a lawyer for the Aquino
government.
   Claiming violations of U.S. racketeering laws, as well as bribes,
theft, extortion, conspiracy and other violations in the
Philippines, the lawsuit seeks return of the property plus $50
billion in punitive damages.
   Lawyers for the Marcoses have contended the civil lawsuit belongs
in Philippine courts. They also argue that the lawsuit raises
essentially political questions requiring a U.S. court to decide the
legality of Marcos' rule, issues beyond the competence of judges.
   Noonan said the lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that a court can
evaluate.
   ``Bribetaking, theft, embezzlement, extortion, fraud and
conspiracy to do these things are all acts susceptible of concrete
proofs that need not involve political questions,'' he said.
   U.S. courts are capable of interpreting Philippine law and ``have
had no difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposed
ruler from his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law,''
the judge said.

   A doctor charged with killing his
terminally ill wife with a drug overdose after she unsuccessfully
tried to commit suicide was cleared of all charges Thursday in a
case sparked by a TV interview.
   Dr. Peter Rosier, who said he wanted to end his wife's suffering
from cancer, was found innocent of first-degree murder, attempted
murder and conspiracy.
   The state charged that Rosier obtained Seconal sedatives for his
wife to commit suicide, administered morphine when the Seconal only
left her comatose, and eventually manipulated her stepfather and
brothers into finishing the job by smothering her.
   Rosier, a Fort Myers pathologist who faced up to life in prison,
jumped to his feet and wept when the verdict was read. Then he
hugged his children.
   Later, he said all he felt was ``relief. The pain of this trial
was over. ... The love of my life was vindicated.''
   Rosier later said, ``If anything good has come out of this it is
perhaps that people in the U.S. will start to look at the terminally
ill and the rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible
tragedy that befell Patricia Rosier and the rest of our family.''
   The charges were brought after Rosier appeared on a television
interview and described administering the drug overdoses to his
wife, Patricia, who was 43 when she died Jan. 15, 1986. Prosecutors
contended he hoped to profit from her death with a book about it.
   The Pinellas County Circuit Court jury deliberated slightly more
than three hours after hearing four weeks of testimony.
   An alternate juror who was excused when deliberations began said
that while he was opposed to mercy killing, he didn't think the
state proved premeditated murder.
   ``I couldn't specifically find him guilty of first-degree murder
myself. Maybe attempted. Maybe conspiracy,'' said Glenn Ford, 29, a
savings and loan security guard. ``From the evidence, I just don't
think he met the key elements in ending the life. I think that's
what the Almighty God is supposed to do.''
   The prosecution charged that Rosier, 47, pained by his wife's
fast-spreading cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to take and
administered morphine injections and suppositories when she didn't
die from the sedatives.
   After she lingered for 12 hours in a comatose state, her
stepfather, Vincent Delman, testified he decided ``enough's
enough,'' went into her bedroom and smothered her while his two sons
watched.
   Delman and his sons Russell and Farrell received immunity from
prosecution in return for their testimony before prosecutors knew of
their role in her death. Prosecutors said they had no choice but to
give them immunity because the body was cremated and there were no
other witnesses.
   Prosecutors maintained that Rosier used his medical expertise to
engineer his wife's death in conspiracy with the Delmans and
manipulated them into committing the final act.
   But the defense portrayed Rosier as a loving husband of 22 years
who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful
end. Neither side disputed that Mrs. Rosier wanted to commit suicide
when she learned cancer had spread from her lungs to her brain and
adrenal glands.
   ``He was a skilled and conscientious pathologist, this man
they're trying to paint as `killer doc,''' defense attorney Stanley
Rosenblatt said in closing arguments Wednesday. ``It's not `killer
doc.' It's a good, decent man who made serious mistakes in his life,
who made self-destructive mistakes.
   ``The state of Florida bought a pig in a poke _ three times,''
said Rosenblatt, who did not call any witnesses. ``The three Delmans
who ended Patricia's life _ they walk _ and a loving husband of 22
years is put on trial for murder.''

   Afghanistan's official radio said
Thursday a Moslem guerrilla group hijacked a U.N. grain convoy and
detained three employees of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   Milton Merino, spokesman for the office of the U.N. Coordinator
for Afghanistan in Geneva, said two relief trucks were stopped about
100 miles north of Kabul, and ``it seems that some of the contents
... were taken.''
   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva said the three
employees _two Afghans and a Canadian named Louis Barbeau _ were
detained by an unknown group and released Monday. He said they were
in a 17-truck convoy delivering grain to areas outside Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
   Merino said the convoy was the first to try delivering food to
outlying areas under the U.N.-sponsored program.
   Kabul radio said members of Gulbaddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami
guerrilla group blocked a road in Parwan province, central
Afghanistan, and looted 10 U.N. trucks.
   The radio consistently blames Hekmatyar's group for events inside
Afghanistan. Shah Mahmood, a spokesman for the Hezb-e-Islami in
Islamabad, denied involvement in the hijacking.
   Mohammad Shoaib of the Jamiat-e-Islami insurgents, who have a
strong force in Parwan province, said, ``We don't know who would
have stopped the convoy.''
   Late last year, there were reports of medicine supplies destined
for Jamiat commander Ahmad Shah Masood being hijacked by Hekmatyar's
guerrillas in northeastern Afghanistan.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. Soviet troops now are withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated
agreement.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Thursday at the organization's
headquarters in New York the convoy's problems had been ``greatly
exaggerated by the press.''
   She said Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. official in charge of
Afghan relief, ``feels it has been blown out of proportion by the
media.''
   ``It was a misunderstanding about the route of the convoy and he
pointed out there are many checkpoints along the way and the signals
were not functioning properly,'' she said, adding: ``The U.N. staff
who were abducted, or whatever, was in constant touch by radio with
headquarters.''
   More than $1 billion in aid is being sought by the United Nations
to assist more than 5 million refugees when they return to
Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran.

   A Holocaust survivor splashed acid in the face
of a lawyer for convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk at a
funeral Thursday for another Demjanjuk attorney who committed
suicide.
   The injured lawyer, Yoram Sheftel, was reported in satisfactory
condition at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital's eye unit, where he was
transferred for treatment after the incident.
   The attorney complained of blurred vision and pain in his left
eye and will be kept under observation for several days, said Ruth
Mekel, a Hadassah spokeswoman.
   A woman standing near Sheftel suffered a minor eye injury from
the acid.
   Police identified the assailant as 70-year-old Yisrael
Yehezkieli, who was detained after the attack at Jerusalem's
Sanhedria Cemetery. He was seen being led away with his hands cupped
over his face.
   The national Itim news agency quoted the assailant as telling
police interrogators that all his family were killed by the Nazis
and that ``these killers are not worthy of defense.''
   Israel Television, which reported the attack, announced it was
canceling the scheduled broadcast of a documentary film on the
Demjanjuk trial.
   Police officials who insisted on anonymity said Yehezkieli lived
in a home for the elderly in the working-class Katamon quarter of
Jerusalem. He was employed as a guard at the Education Ministry,
they said. Divorced and the father of three children, Yehezkieli was
believed to be from Poland, they said.
   Reporters who covered the 14-month Demjanjuk trial said
Yehezkieli was a frequent spectator.
   The police officials said Yehezkieli apparently was upset about
the suicide of Demjanjuk lawyer Dov Eitan, who was buried Thursday.
They quoted him as telling neighbors: ``I wanted to speak to Eitan,
and now I have nobody to talk to.''
   Eitan, a 53-year-old former district judge, died Tuesday after
jumping from a 15th floor hotel window in Jerusalem. Police said the
death was a suicide.
   Itim quoted an unidentified witness as saying the assailant
shouted ``Eitan died because of you!'' before hurling the acid.
   The injured woman, identified as Edna Shabtai, a writer from Tel
Aviv, was released after treatment, hospital officials said.
   Ms. Shabtai said on Israel radio that she heard Yehezkieli shout
``Everything is because of you!'' then felt the acid strike her face.
   Eitan's death has delayed Demjanjuk's Supreme Court appeal of a
death sentence until May 4. The appeal had been scheduled to begin
Monday.
   Demjanjuk, a 68-year-old retired autoworker from suburban
Cleveland, was sentenced to death in April for committing crimes
against humanity and the Jewish people as an operator of gas
chambers at Treblinka death camp in Poland, where 850,000 Jews
perished during World War II.
   He has consistently denied he was ``Ivan the Terrible'' of the
Treblinka camp.
   Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, said in a telephone interview
from Cleveland that the family was saddened by the acid-throwing
incident.
   ``It shows there is very much emotion surrounding this trial,''
he said.
   Nishnic said the attack on Sheftel could hamper the family's
efforts to find an Israeli lawyer to replace Eitan in the case.
   ``This is going to make it even more difficult to find another
attorney,'' he said.

   A school board Thursday postponed a
decision whether to fire a math teacher who refuses to change the
way he dresses after a state official said such action would be
``taking a cannon to shoot down a mosquito.''
   Board members said they will decide Dec. 19 whether to fire
teacher Bill Webb.
   The board went into executive session at 8:45 p.m. for about 50
minutes before postponing the decision to review testimony and
examine evidence.
   Webb had said the special Mason County school board meeting
probably would end his 20-year association with Point Pleasant High,
where his daughter is the student body president. ``I expect to be
fired,'' he said.
   About 80 people crammed into the meeting room before the board
went into executive session.
   The controversy began in August when the board said male
instructors would have to wear ties, a change from contracts
teachers signed last spring. Three teachers followed normal
grievance procedures and lost.
   Webb, a Gallipolis, Ohio, farmer who teaches high-level math at
Point Pleasant High, ignored the order and was suspended three times.
   The board changed its policy again Nov. 21 and allowed male
employees to go tieless, but still prohibits jeans and denim. Webb
is opposed to any change in his contract.
   West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Hechler told the board
Thursday night that a decision to fire Webb would have repercussions.
   ``It will certainly be reversed by the courts, and that will
embarrass the school board. You're taking a cannon to shoot down a
mosquito,'' Hechler said.
   School Superintendent Charles Chambers said ``non-verbal behavior
is much more believable than verbal behavior.'' He said Webb's fight
was disruptive in the classroom and set a bad example for his 122
students.
   ``Teachers are adult role models for their students. The habits
and behavior patterns of students are influenced by what they
observe in their teachers,'' Chambers said.
   Webb's lawyer, Lawrence Kopleman, said the 15 charges that
Chambers cited in his opening address were moot because the board
has changed its policy.
   Kopleman said Webb's refusal was not insubordination but simply
civil disobedience.
   Webb originally was suspended for four days with pay in early
October, then for 11 days without pay later in the month. On
Halloween, Chambers suspended Webb for up to 30 days without pay.
   Webb has an appeal of the 11-day suspension pending with a state
hearing examiner, who must reach a decision by Dec. 15.
   Before Thursday's hearing, Chambers offered Webb a final chance
to give up wearing jeans to class and to drop his state appeal,
which includes an attempt to recover 41 days of pay. Webb rejected
the offer.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took
office Thursday and promised to push for political and economic
modernization, as opponents protested his inauguration in congress
and in the streets.
   Salinas, a 40-year-old economist, succeeds President Miguel de la
Madrid for a six-year term. He inherits an economy threatened by
both recession and inflation, growth squeezed by a $102 billion
foreign debt, and a population impatient after six years of
austerity that reduced earnings about 50 percent.
   ``I take office in a complex hour. ... It is a singular moment in
our history, heavy with risks but rich in opportunity,'' Salinas
said in his inaugural address. He said he would govern ``for all
Mexicans'' and promised ``nationalist, democratic and popular''
reforms.
   He said efforts to reduce Mexico's foreign debt would begin
immediately.
   About 140 delegates from the leftist National Democratic Front
walked out of the Legislative Palace just before Salinas was
inaugurated, and members of the conservative National Action Party
held up signs declaring ``Fraud.''
   ``We are walking out because we don't want to endorse with our
presence the legitimacy of the Salinas de Gortari government,'' said
delegate Jaime Hernandez. The opposition maintains that Salinas'
Institutional Revolutionary Party cheated to win the July 6
presidential election and that Democratic Front nominee Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas was the real victor.
   Outside, thousands of Democratic Front supporters threw rocks at
police. Many in the crowd carried sticks. Several police and
demonstrators were injured.
   Police used tear gas to disperse about 1,500 demonstrators in the
Zocalo, the central square in front of the National Palace where a
post-inauguration parade was held. One woman held up two dead rats
and said they symbolized Salinas.
   Red Cross paramedic Carlos Daniel Ramirez said about 150 people
were injured, including police and soldiers, and treated at the
scene. A police spokeswoman said many arrests were made.
   Scattered demonstrations persisted through the day.
   Salinas invited the opposition to a political dialogue that would
include ``perfecting'' the electoral process, but said political
change is not enough.
   Unless the economic crisis is overcome, he said, ``stagnation
will wilt democracy, political competition will turn into social
conflict and frustrate aims for social justice.''
   Salinas said negotiations will begin at once on Mexico's debt,
aimed at cutting debt payments to a level that will leave the
country with enough money to invest in development and growth.
   ``We will look for new equilibriums with the United States, an
area of opportunities and delicate differences,'' Salinas said.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz had an afternoon meeting
with Salinas and praised his inaugural address. He told reporters
Salinas felt ``good chemistry'' existed between himself and
President-elect George Bush.
   In an unusual arrangement, opposition leaders were permitted to
make televised speeches questioning Salinas' election before the
inauguration. In return, they agreed not to disrupt the actual
ceremony.
   Although the speeches were televised, walkouts and protest signs
were not shown. Cameras also avoided showing the brief violence in
the Zocalo.
   The new president outlined a vision of modern Mexico in keeping
with his free market ideas, in which a paternalistic state would
give way to a partnership of political parties, business, labor,
citizens' groups and the church.
   Democratic Front delegate Marcela Lombardo said in her speech
that Mexicans had actually voted for a ``radically different
program.''
   In his campaign, Cardenas called for increased government control
of the economy and a moratorium on debt payments.
   According to official figures, Salinas won barely more than 50
percent of the vote, Cardenas won 31 percent and National Action
candidate Manuel Clouthier, 17 percent.
   During his speech Salinas introduced heads of government
attending. The biggest rounds of applause went to presidents Fidel
Castro of Cuba and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.
   Also there were presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Raul
Alfonsin of Argentina, Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador, Jose
Azcona Hoyo of Honduras and Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and
Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel of Belize.
   The U.S. delegation included Bush's son, John, and John's
Mexican-American wife, Columba.

   The United States refused a request by the
General Assembly to issue a visa to Yasser Arafat so the PLO
chairman can speak to the world body on the Palestine issue, a U.N.
spokesman said Thursday.
   Arab diplomats said they would introduce a resolution Friday
morning to move the General Assembly from U.N. headquarters in New
York to Geneva to hear Arafat.
   A ranking U.N. official said a vote to move to Geneva could be
taken Monday and approval was certain.
   ``The secretary-general has received from the United States a
reply to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly asking the
United States to review and rescind its decision not to issue a visa
to Mr. Arafat,'' said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   ``This reply from the United States is negative, and will be
contained in a report by the secretary-general to come out tomorrow
morning,'' he added.
   The letter of refusal was ``extremely negative,'' said a
diplomatic source who saw the note.
   Arafat wanted to speak Thursday, the original opening day of the
assembly debate on Palestinian issues. But the State Department
denied the visa last Saturday on grounds the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization was an accessory to terrorism.
   Earlier Thursday, a rally outside U.N. headquarters intended to
welcome Arafat became a protest by about 400 people at which
Palestinians and a few dozen anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews denounced
the refusal of a visa.
   Demostrators waved Palestinian flags and pictures of Arafat,
chanting ``Long Live the PLO!'' Most of the Palestinians wore
checked head scarves, Arafat's trademark.
   Standing among them holding anti-Zionist banners were
ultra-Orthodox Jews, in long black coats and wide brimmed hats, who
belong to the Orthodox Jews Against Zionism (Neturei Karta) group
and oppose the concept of a Jewish state.
   On Wednesday, the General Assembly denounced the United States
for refusing to let Arafat address it, giving Washington until
midnight Thursday to provide a visa. Only the United States and
Israel voted against the resolution, and Britain abstained.
   Arafat wants to address the General Assembly about the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state Nov. 15 and a
political statement that implicitly recognizes Israel by accepting
U.N. resolutions on the Middle East.
   Undersecretary-General Joseph V. Reed said the Secretariat was
making plans to move the General Assembly to Geneva, where the
session is expected to reconvene in mid-December.
   The United States says it does not oppose a move to Geneva and
would participate in the debate there.
   If the meeting goes to Geneva, it would be the first time the
General Assembly has transferred a meeting out of the United States
in protest.
   The resolution authorizing the move must be heard by a 16-member
budgetary advisory committee Friday because of the expense involved,
then would go to the General Assembly's finance committee before
reaching a vote in the assembly itself.
   The PLO has had a U.N. mission since 1975 and holds non-voting
observer status. The U.N. considers it the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people and invites it to speak in
debates concerning Palestinians and the Middle East.

   A suspicious fire destroyed almost an entire
block of an inner city neighborhood Thursday night, but no one was
injured and the blaze was brought under control within an hour,
officials said.
   The fire was set in a vacant building and quickly spread. Nine
buildings were destroyed, but only one was occupied at the time,
said Fire Superintendent William McCrossen.
   One person was in custody for questioning, McCrossen said.
   The Mid-City neighborhood had been the site of several recent

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle may spend more
time than his predecessors presiding over the Senate, a move that
could spell conflict between the Democratic-controlled chamber and
the administration.
   In an interview, Quayle on Wednesday also made his strongest
public rejection of the notion that he will act as the link between
the administration and the Republican Party's far right.
   He also said his verbal gaffes during the campaign gave him some
hard lessons about his own tendency to talk too much. Being besieged
with questions and jokes about his qualifications was painful but
educational, he said.
   ``I know myself better now. I'm a stronger person,'' he said.

   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a disciple and
exponent of the free market who becomes president of Mexico today,
welcomed Latin American leaders and diplomats from around the world
despite protests from his electoral opponents.
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba, President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua and other heads of state attended a private dinner
Wednesday for Salinas at the National Palace.
   Salinas was scheduled to take the reins of power from President
Miguel de la Madrid after his opponents registered their objections
in speeches on national television.
   ``This is a very important advance on the road to democracy,''
said Juan Cardenas Garcia, spokesman for the Popular Socialist
Party. ``We will be able to get our message to the Mexican people
without violence or problems.''

   After 38 years of continuous Soviet jamming of
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, millions of people in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union are now getting ``loud and clear'' news
programming from the West about their own cultures.
   Word that the more than 2,000 jamming transmitters in Russia,
other Soviet states and Afghanistan had shut down spread through
Europe on Wednesday as shortwave radio operators discovered the
annoying, raspy hum of Soviet interference was no longer heard over
U.S., West German, Israeli or other broadcasts.
   ``The hum is gone,'' announced Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., chairman of
the Board for Overseas Broadcasting, which directs the $200
million-a-year U.S. broadcasting effort based in Europe. ``We think
this is a very significant move by the Soviet Union,'' Forbes said
at a news conference.
   Future programming aimed at the services' estimated 55 million
listeners could now include more music, fewer repeated programs and
such new features as call-in talk shows, officials said.

   The wrong man spent 11 years in prison for the
murder of a police officer, his former accuser said as he recanted
his testimony in a dramatic real-life epilogue to the documentary
movie ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``I feel like it's my responsibility to step forward _ to be a
man _ and admit my part in it,'' said David Ray Harris, who at age
16 testified in 1977 that Randall Dale Adams killed Dallas police
officer Robert Wood.
   Harris, now a death row inmate in an unrelated killing, was the
first witness to testify Wednesday in a state district court hearing
in which Adams is seeking a new trial.
   Adams was convicted of the Nov. 28, 1976, shooting death of Wood,
and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life in
prison. He has maintained his innocence, and ``The Thin Blue Line,''
a Public Broadcasting Service production released to selected
theaters this summer, questioned his conviction.

   The most recent surprise inspections of the
nation's nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food
sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent didn't properly
administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene, the government
reported Thursday.
   In a 75-volume guide for consumers, federal officials released
grades for each of the 15,000 nursing homes on 32 of the
approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once
a year in on-site inspections.
   Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories.
But about 2,400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32
categories.
   The massive report, a compilation of material previously
available only on a piece-meal basis through state regulatory
agencies, amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for
people looking for a nursing home.

   In the central highlands of this
island nation, health officials are using DTT, banned in other parts
of the world, to combat a disease that once was under control _
malaria.
   Specially trained teams are spraying the inner walls of thousands
of homes with the powerful insecticide because it is deemed the most
effective and practical way for Madagascar, a nation struggling with
economic problems.
   A resurgence of malaria in the central highlands has already
claimed thousands of lives in the last two years, and a government
report said malaria could claim 100,000 to 250,000 lives in the next
six months if emergency measures were not taken.
   Malaria had largely disappeared from the central highlands, a
strip up to 170 miles wide running nearly 850 miles north to south,
after French colonial authorities used DDT in antimalarial campaigns
and drugs to treat those who got the disease.
   But the spraying stopped after independence in 1960, and in the
economic decline that followed a Socialist revolution in 1975,
antimalarial drugs, which had to be imported, were not available. At
the same time, the highlanders lost the moderate immunity people of
hyperendemic malarious areas usually develop.
   ``When it started coming back, people didn't know what it was,''
said Dr. Daniel Rakotojoelinadrasana, who directs two Lutheran
Church clinics. ``They thought it was a new disease and they named
it `Bemangovitra,' which means the `big chills'.''
   Even if people had recognized it as the old Tazomoka (mosquito
fever) there were virtually no drugs available to combat it. The
country had no foreign exchange to import drugs, and people wouldn't
have been able to afford to buy them in a country where income has
been falling for 20 years and wages average the equivalent of a
dollar a day or less.
   ``The nutritional status had fallen so much it made it much more
severe than in a healthy population,'' said Edmond de Gaiffier of
the World Bank.
   No reliable figures are available on how many people have died of
malaria in recent years, as any fever is usually diagnosed as
malaria. Few facilities are available for blood tests, and many
people have no access to any health care.
   Health Minister Jean-Jacques Seraphin and the World Health
Organization representative, Dr. Cyprian Hakizimana, said published
reports of 100,000 deaths were exaggerated.
   World Bank specialists said the toll was probably more in the
range of 30,000 and Dr. Pierre Coulanges, director of the Pasteur
Institute here, said the toll could be as high as 50,000 and in some
villages 20 percent of the residents had died.
   The plan to combat the malaria threat includes two controversial
elements.
   The first is the use of DDT, banned in developed countries after
it was found to be entering the food chain.
   Hakizimana said the World Health Organization had approved DDT as
a one-time measure because of the grave threat Madagascar faced, and
it will only be used inside houses, not on crops.
   De Gaiffier said DDT has acquired such a bad name that it wasn't
easy to find the 50 to 80 tons needed in Madagascar. It is preferred
because it remains effective for six months or more, through the
rainy season on the 226,658-square-mile island of 11 million people.
   Spraying on the walls will be effective because the malarial
mosquitoes rest on walls after biting their victims, said
Rakotojoelinadrasana.
   The second controversy involves the World Health Organization's
policy of providing drugs for treatment after people are infected
rather than distributing them for prophylaxsis, or prevention.
   Health Minister Seraphin said the government will make drugs
available for prophylaxsis only for children up to age 6 and
pregnant women.
   The World Health Organization recommends against use of drugs for
prophylaxsis in hyperendemic areas because of the cost, fears that
it will facilitate the spread of resistance and concerns about the
side effects.
   ``The WHO recommendation is logical on theoretical grounds,''
Rakotojoelinadrasana said. ``But the problem is that people who get
malaria may die from it. As medical doctors we are hesitating to
advise people to get malaria and then come to us.''
   De Gaiffier said scientists are very worried about the increasing
prevalance of malaria in higher elevations.
   It is ``following economic development up the mountain where
there are new population reservoirs with no immunity,'' he added.
   Farmers are using every piece of land they can find, including
steep hillsides, to grow rice and other crops. Rice is heavily
consumed in Madagascar and rice fields are perfect breeding grounds
for malaria mosquitoes.

   Reports of a spate of witchcraft rituals
troubled one Ohio community so much they became a priority to the
police, and investigators soon turned to a rarely tapped source: the
library.
   In a Louisiana parish, the police chief wanted the names of those
who had checked out library materials on the occult, not because
there was a problem ``but just in case there might be one in the
future.''
   Increasingly librarians resist requests for records of what
books, films or other materials their patrons check out. They say
the borrowings could be misinterpreted, placing innocent people
under false suspicion.
   Further, said Ohio Library Association executive director Bonnie
Beth Mitchell: ``If people really understood what they could get
about other people ... by tapping their library records, we'd be out
of the library business.''
   In this state, where an Open Records law does not exempt library
records from public scrutiny, librarians have proposed legislation
to make the records confidential. Thirty-eight states and the
District of Columbia already have such a statute, requiring a court
order to release the records.
   ``We're not obstructionists,'' said Judith Krug, director of the
American Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom in
Chicago. ``We just want to be sure the police or anybody else just
can't walk in half-cocked for no good reason.''
   Ms. Krug said the organization has fought since 1970 against
releasing records.
   She cited the Louisiana case, calling the police chief's request
``absolutely ridiculous,'' and she recalled a librarian at Bucknell
University in Lewisburg, Pa., who spent 15 days in jail in the early
1970s for refusing federal investigators' demand for the records of
Vietnam war protesters Daniel and Philip Berrigan.
   The case was one of the factors that led to Pennsylvania's
decision to pass a confidentiality law, she said.
   Besides Ohio, the states that do not have library confidentiality
laws are Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Kentucky and Texas, although
attorneys general in the latter two states have issued opinions
favoring confidentiality.
   In the Ohio battle over the Open Records law, law enforcement
lobbyists say library records are a valuable if rarely used
investigative tool they will not relinquish.
   The Ohio Library Association, however, calls public access to the
records a loophole in the law and an assault on the First Amendment.
   The difference of opinion has forced many of Ohio's 250 public
libraries to adopt policies that contradict the law. In 1983, one
librarian nearly landed in jail for his defiance.
   The Ohio Library Association and the Ohio Library Trustees
Association, with 4,100 members between them, drafted legislation
that would make patron records confidential, permitting their
release to police only under a court order.
   The measure cleared the state Senate but has been stalled by
opposition in a House committee _ and now Ms. Mitchell said
amendments have changed the bill so much the library groups no
longer support it.
   The amendments, backed by the Ohio Association of Chiefs of
Police and the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association, would, among
other things, eliminate the court-order requirement.
   The OLA plans to re-introduce its bill next year.
   A survey conducted by the association earlier this year found
that six of 40 libraries questioned had received requests from local
and state police for information about patrons and what they had
borrowed. Eighteen reported that patrons had inquired about fellow
patrons.
   In all of the instances, including the case of the alleged
witchcraft rituals in Defiance County, the requests were rejected
under library policies that forbid release of such information
without a court order.
   The FBI also is interested in the reading habits of library
patrons and has tried to recruit library personnel around the
country to watch their patrons, according to recently released
federal records.
   An FBI agent visited the University of Cincinnati library in 1985
and again in 1986 to check the reading lists of two Soviet citizens,
said the American Library Association. Both times, the agent's
request was rejected by head librarian Dorothy Byers.
   Librarians would prefer that none of the patron-related
information they guard be made public, but realize a need to help
the authorities in legitimate cases, Ms. Mitchell said.
   ``We're not refusing to help. In fact, we want to,'' she said.
``But we will not allow fishing expeditions, and we will not allow
innocent people to be put under suspicion simply because they use a
library.''
   ``We're trying to protect people's rights here,'' she said.
   Librarians also fear they will be held liable if information they
release results in harm to the patron, although an amendment
proposed by law enforcement groups would relieve a librarian of
criminal or civil liability.
   John Gilchrist, a lobbyist for the Ohio Association of Chiefs of
Police, said another amendment was crucial: ``The OLA wants the
police to testify about what they're looking for at a hearing before
they get a court order. That hearing, which would probably be
public, defeats the whole purpose of an investigation. You don't
want the person you're looking for to know you're looking for them.
   ``That could put innocent people in a bad light.''
   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union thinks
even requiring a court order would be insufficient protection.
   ``None of this should be made public,'' said ACLU Executive
Director Ann Zeller. ``Opening these records to the police or the
courts would suddenly and improperly make someone a suspect merely
because they like to read.''
   Steven Hawk, executive librarian of the Akron-Summit County
Public Library, was threatened with jail for refusing to comply with
a subpoena seeking a list of reading material requested by a jail
inmate who was suspected in attacks on several women. The attacker
had quoted French writer Francois Villon.
   Hawk said the subpoena, seeking a list of everything the man
checked out, was too broad. But after prosecutors agreed to rewrite
it to specify release only of information related to Villon's works,
the library complied. The inmate, who had indeed checked out Villon,
was convicted. He had also been identified in a lineup.
   Librarians say their policies protect the confidentiality of more
than patron reading lists.
   Several libraries reported they have refused solitications from
companies asking to buy a list of patrons' names, addresses and
telephone numbers, and from collection agencies looking for
delinquent consumers.
   The American Library Association this year launched an effort to
pass federal confidentiality legislation that would have covered
library records and other services, including video rentals. The FBI
had sought access to library information without a court order in
cases involving national security. The bill died when Congress
adjourned.
   Said Ms. Krug, ``We're going to try again, and probably again.''

   The most irritating thing about Sunday's Hallmark
Hall of Fame presentation on CBS, ``The Tenth Man,'' is how
self-consciously Important it is.
   Based on Graham Greene's intriguing story of a French lawyer
imprisoned by the Nazis (Anthony Hopkins) who trades his wealth for
his life, ``The Tenth Man'' is tedious and overwrought, as
exemplified by the cloyingly romantic music overwhelming almost
every scene. It's composed by Lee Holdridge, who wrote the theme for
``Beauty and the Beast.''
   Hopkins can be effecting in the right role, but here he is merely
irritating, employing varying degrees of one emotion: dumbfounded.
   There is some hope when the flamboyant Derek Jacobi bursts on the
scene late in the drama to add the final plot twist, but by then
it's snoozing time.
   The movie was shot on location in France. Why? Most of the scenes
are interiors.
   Hopkins plays Jean Louis Chavel, a successful attorney with an
estate outside Paris who is accidentally picked up in a Nazi sweep
of innocent citizenry. In prison, he is selected as one of a random
few _ every 10th prisoner _ to be executed in retribution against
the Resistance.
   Chavel tries to buy his life, offering everything he has to any
man who will take his place in front of the firing squad. Michel
Mangeot (Timothy Watkins), a young man with a bad cough, takes him
up on the deal, so he can leave Chavel's wealth to his mother and
sister.
   Three years later, France is liberated, and Chavel returns to his
mansion, now in disrepair, where Michel's mother and sister are
living. He conceals his identity and Michel's attractive sister,
Therese (Kristin Scott Thomas), hires him as a handyman. She spends
most of her spare time imagining how she will kill the hated Chavel.
   The plot begins to thicken when Jacobi arrives, claiming to be
Chavel, but he's mostly lost in the headlong rush to the
inexplicable conclusion.

   Hal (Dabney Coleman) and Julia (Jane Curtin) have a fabulous
life. They live in a beach house, eat exotic foods, drive
his-and-hers sports cars and vacation in romantic, out-of-the-way
places.
   Hal is 57 and has two grown children from a previous marriage. He
is perfectly satisfied to dote part-time on his two grandchildren.
Julia is 39, a career woman who displays little more than mild
anxiety when little ones are around _ until her best friend has a
baby.
   ``Maybe Baby,'' previously titled ``Sooner or Later,'' is a cute,
sophisticated story of a spoiled woman who thinks having a baby will
be as easy as having an Alfa Romeo. It airs Monday on NBC.
   Once Julia convinces herself she needs a baby, she has to
convince Hal, who doesn't want ``one of those noisy, messy little
things'' or to be the only 70-year-old on the sidelines at the
Little League games. But he goes along after his secretary (Florence
Stanley) convinces him a 39-year-old woman who's spent 20 years on
birth control pills is unlikely to get pregnant.
   How does she know about the pills? ``Put any two women in the
same room and they'll talk about birth control,'' she says. ``It's
like men and sports, only infinitely more interesting.''
   Except for a silly scene when Julia finds Hal dining with another
woman, ``Maybe Baby'' is funny and plausible. Coleman and Curtin
make a nice team, and the supporting roles are nicely played. Julia
Duffy (``Newhart'') plays Hal's daughter.
   Janet Kovalcik, who wrote the screenplay, has the confidence to
put this line in Florence Stanley's mouth: ``This is why I don't
watch soap operas. Because the plots are stupid and boring and the
people act like jerks.''
   But of course that's exactly why we watch soap operas, and movies
like ``Maybe Baby.''

for ``Molly'' next April. Emily, uncast, is a former actress who
goes to work for a New York private investigation agency. The

``Perfect Strangers,'' who took a job as a private investigator in
New York while struggling to make it as an actress.

<HEAD>Let's Not Open a Pizza Parlor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a tale of two people who opened a pizza
parlor, and learned to their chagrin that a mandated benefit is
really a tax.
   It is a story related by Professor William O. Dunkelberg, who is
also dean of Temple University's School of Business and Management,
in an effort to make clear that taxes and mandated benefits carry
similar burdens.
   The term ``mandated benefits'' is one of those euphemisms used to
avoid the stigma of the terrible ``T'' word, and that suggests it
could get a workout during an administration pledged to no tax
increases.
   The partners scrape together $20,000 and enough other financing
to get into operation. They employ 20 people the first year and
manage to take home $15,000 each, enough to stay in business rather
than working for someone else.
   Since there are a large number of pizza places, it soon becomes
clear they cannot make much more than $15,000 each because of the
competition. So, each year they settle for $15,000 each.
   Then, suddenly, they are required to provide health insurance for
the 20 workers, most of whom are young and already covered by family
insurance. This costs $500 a year for each employee, or a total of
$10,000 a year.
   At the end of the year, therefore, the two partners have earned
only $10,000 each to support their families. Something must be done;
a conference is held.
   They consider closing shop and working for someone else, but that
would mean firing 20 employees. They could be content with $10,000
each, though they could make $15,000 elsewhere. They could cut
wages. They could raise prices.
   They decide to raise prices. So do their competitors, who are
faced with the same situation. However, it becomes clear that at
higher prices people buy less pizza. They are forced to fire an
employee. Their competitors do likewise.
   As a result, at the end of the year they are nearly able to
restore their $15,000 salaries. In effect, their customers and the
employees who lost their jobs paid for the mandated benefits.
Somebody had to.
   Ultimately, it might have worked out differently. As an
alternative, the market might have reduced the cash pay of all pizza
workers so that the cash, plus the new health benefits, would have
equaled the old wages.
   If that were the eventuality, those receiving the benefits would
have paid directly. But they might have rebelled, especially since
most did not want the coverage. Even worse, those that did, might
have gotten them cheaper elsewhere.
   Now, says Dunkelberg, substitute ``profit tax'' or ``minimum
wage'' or ``mandatory child care'' or any other mandated government
program. You would get the same results as were obtained from the
mandated medical insurance.
   Now, the professor suggests, consider this: Many people receive
so-called benefits they do not want. Many who receive benefits are
not members of the target groups that government is trying to help.
   In such ways, says Dunkelberg, we lay waste our tax money. And
the waste is worsened by the medium of distribution, which is the
small company. Small companies, he observes, are not efficient
administrators of social programs.
   What small companies do well _ and 90 percent of all U.S.
employers have 20 or fewer employees _ is produce goods and
services. When we divert them from what they do well, says
Dunkelberg, the entire economy suffers.
   He says these programs can mean higher prices for poor and rich
alike, maybe lower wages, inefficient distribution of services,
layoffs, and perhaps fewer businesses.
   Many people will be forced to pay for and receive services they
do not want. Even worse, most of the benefits will be received by
consumers who do not belong to the target groups that Congress
desires to help.
   Mandated benefits? ``It's a terrible idea, and it is time we
recognized it as such,'' Dunkelberg said.

<HEAD>Dutch Farmers Told to Keep Cows in Barn to Protect Water Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIERLINGSBEEK, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have ordered an 8
p.m.-6 a.m. curfew from spring to fall for cows in the pastures of
this small Dutch farming community.
   The new measure requires farmers to put their cattle in barns at
night and keep their droppings outdoors from polluting the area's
drinking water.
   The curfew, which takes effect Jan. 1, 1990, has farmers irate.
For as long as anyone can remember they have left their cattle in
the pastures at night during the warm months, saving the expense and
time of moving them in and out of barns every day.
   But environmentalists claim the cows' nights out are causing a
serious pollution threat to the water supplies of tens of thousands
of people in the southeastern Netherlands.
   ``The measure is part of a package to curb the contamination of
our drinking water supplies with nitrates,'' said Henk van Loon, a
spokesman for Noord-Brabant, the southern province that includes
this town of 7,800 people, 70 miles southeast from Amsterdam.
   Earlier this year, the provincial environmental agency
established that in the Vierlingsbeek reservoirs, which supplies
drinking water to 25,000 households in the area, the levels of
nitrates, which are components of animal excrement, were three times
as high as the 200 milligrams per gallon allowed under Dutch law.
   The human body converts nitrates into nitrites, which can damage
the adrenal glands, especially in infants.
   ``It was time to do something drastic,'' Van Loon said.
   Two-thirds of Dutch households get their drinking water from
deposits such as those in Vierlingsbeek.
   Vierlingsbeek's farmers plan a campaign to protest the measure,
which their spokesman, Wil Kuenen, claims will cost them
``fortunes.''
   He explained that herding the cattle to and from pastures every
day _ instead of letting them out and keeping them out from April to
November _ will mean higher labor costs for farmers.
   ``It will take hours to get the animals into the pastures and
back,'' Kuenen said.
   ``We're being singled out while there are many more sources of
nitrate pollution.''
   Dutch Agriculture Ministry figures indicate that the main source
of ground water pollution is the 90,000 tons of manure produced
annually by 5 million cows, 14 million pigs, and 92 million chickens.
   Pigs and chickens are put indoors at night year-round, but their
droppings are often disposed of outdoors.
   ``The only way out was to ban animals from the land for part of
the day,'' said provincial spokesman Van Loon.
   Under the provincial bylaw creating the curfew, cattle breeders
face stiff fines if they let their cattle graze at night.
   The curfew covers 1,771 acres of grazing land covering water
holdings in Vierlingsbeek and neighboring Boxmeer, Van Loon said.
   The measure also strictly limits the nitrate content of
fertilizers used by the area's corn growers, he said.
   Farmers contend they aren't the only culprits.
   The Rhine and the Meuse rivers, which together provide some 30
percent of the drinking water needs of the Netherlands' 11 million
people, are heavily contaminated with pesticides and herbicides
dumped by West German and Swiss chemical companies, according to Jur
Lieffering, a spokesman for the Association of Dutch Water Supply
Companies.
   He noted that Dutch produce growers also were contributing to the
crisis via herbicide and insecticide use.

<HEAD>Chicken Pox Keeps Mick Jones Off the Road</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A case of chicken pox made Mick Jones cancel this
fall's ``Big Audio Dynamite'' tour. But Jones vows to come back.
   ``Tighten Up Vol. 88'' is the band's latest album and ``Just Play
Music,'' the first single, is receiving radio play in the United
States.
   With the group planning to resume touring after the new year,
Jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum.
   ``I think it's a growing thing, a matter of getting people to
listen, changing the way they think. I just want to communicate and
play music,'' said the 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter, who
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown
Manhattan.
   ``I was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable,''
he said, before canceling the tour.
   ``We were ravaged by the critics, but the music wasn't for them.
It was for more _ it was music with a reason, with something to say.
You can put us on page 13 of your paper, but you can't ignore us
because the other stuff is going to whither and die.''
   That touch of drama should be no surprise coming from Jones, who
help lead the British punk movement with the Clash a decade ago.
   Jones was born in London in 1955. A fan of such groups as the
Animals and the Kinks, he considered rock 'n' roll ``the most
exciting thing around.'' But in the 1970s, he and many other fans
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock. Punk groups began to
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of
mainstream rock and society in general.
   Like the Sex Pistols, the Clash were crude, loud, angry and
threatening. In short everything they thought rock 'n' roll should
be. ``It needed to happen,'' said Jones. ``We needed it at that
time.''
   Punk wasn't simply a kind of music, it was an attitude. Jones,
like many who grew up in England in the '60s and '70s, felt that the
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans.
   ``The music's just as much about the fans,'' he said. ``They're
very important. They don't want go to the show and just have their
wallet emptied. They've got T-shirts, but they're not anywhere. You
need to take it to the next place.''
   Jones and bassist Paul Simonon were in the punk group London SS
before forming the Clash in 1976 with singer-guitarist Joe Strummer,
previously a member of the 101ers.
   ``At the time I was just expressing myself the only way I
could,'' Jones said. ``We looked at it as if we had a foot in the
door and we were going to go in that door. There has never been
anything like it since.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some
of the most ferocious music ever recorded. As one reviewer noted, it
was music that ``never stops snarling. It's always threatening to
blow up in your face.''
   Jones, who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected
letter bombs, readily agreed with that assessment.
   ``It was quite a rush,'' he said. ``It sounded beautiful to us.
Music should explode, it shouldn't be contained and well behaved and
do what it's told.''
   Although the Clash went on to record classic albums such as
``Give `Em Enough Rope'' and ``London Calling,'' the members of the
band started feuding and by 1984, the group had broken up.
   ``In the end, we ended up writing our own things and sort of
handing them over. It wasn't as much fun.''
   So Jones decided to start fresh. He wasn't interested in forming
a ``Mick Jones Project''; he wanted prospective bandmates to think
of themselves as equals.
   ```Ideas' was the main word. I wanted to have people with good
ideas and fresh ideas,'' he said. ``I was a good enough musician by
that time. I looked for people who had personality. I didn't want it
to just be me.''
   But Jones couldn't deny who would emerge as the band's leader.
   ``It's a dictatorship,'' he said, smiling, ``but a benevolent
dictatorahip. I wanted to make it a more democratic thing. I try and
listen to the others.''
   Jones pieced together a new group, starting with his friend and
ex-Clash video director Don Letts (credited with ``FX and Vocals'').
He added bassist Leo ``E-Zee Kill'' Williams. Drummer Greg Roberts
was hired through a newspaper ad, and Jones then brought in
keyboardist Dan Donovan who originally came to photograph the band.
   The group was named Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), and drew on a
variety of musical styles, notably reggae. The first record, ``This
Is Big Audio Dynamite,'' was released in 1985, and eventually went
gold in Britain.
   Strummer briefly reunited with Jones to co-write and co-produce
B.A.D.'s next record, ``No. 10 Upping Street,'' with its hit single,
``Badrock City.''

<HEAD>Atlantic City Offers Novelists The Right ``Glitter And Sleaze''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drawn by the bright and dazzling
lights of casinos and the bleak squalor of the urban area beyond the
Boardwalk, Atlantic City has become a popular setting for filmmakers
and novelists crafting tales of organized crime, drugs,
prostitution, gambling and murder.
   ``An ugly mixture of glitter and sleaze,'' is how novelist Ovid
Demaris sees the city in his upcoming work, ``Ricochet.'' In ``Under
the Boardwalk,'' author Bill Kent's characters are portrayed in a
``universe of dazzle and slime.''
   TV viewers got glimpses of Atlantic City recently with a movie
based on Elmore Leonard's 1985 novel, ``Glitz,'' starring Markie
Post and Jimmy Smits. In his book, Leonard talks about the glittery
casinos thriving on bus tours that ``dropped the suckers off for six
hours to lose their paychecks.''
   He also describes the city's Inlet neighborhood as an area that
``looked as though it had been fought over in a war, house to house,
and half the people had packed up and left.''
   All the attention gets mixed reviews from city fathers who take
pride in the allure of their town but worry that it's being typecast.
   ``We do look like a perfect stage set,'' said John Fox, a
spokesman for the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Bureau. ``We
have a beautiful stage set along the beachfront with the giant
casinos ... but the rundown neighborhoods also seem to be an easy
target.''
   Mayor James Usry accuses some writers of ``yellow journalism'''
when it concerns Atlantic City. ``But that's what sells papers and
books,'' he said.
   ``I don't know of any Mafia in Atlantic City. You know, these
authors could say it took place in Mayville, Ill., but what would
that mean to people? Atlantic City is one of the most designated
city names in the country.''
   Louis Malle's critically acclaimed movie, ``Atlantic City,''
starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon, marked the start of
Atlantic City's revival as a setting for moviedom and novels. That
was nine years ago, barely a year after legalized gambling began.
   Now barely a month passes without Atlantic City featured in some
TV show, movie or book.
   Diane Keaton has shot scenes in one casino for a story about
three nightclub entertainers. The comedy-magic team of Penn & Teller
was in the resort last spring to film ``Penn & Teller Get Killed.''
   ``Atlantic City Weekend: A Romantic Adventure,'' was released
this fall. Characters in the book by Helen Mourtos include an
entrepreneur ``on the outside of society,'' a casino dealer and a
mysterious nightclub dancer.
   Previews described the novel as ``offering insiders a view of
life in the world of Atlantic City's casinos ... about the
temptations beneath the casinos' bright lights.''
   Fox doesn't think the visions of a sleazy Atlantic City have
driven away business or visitors.
   ``I can't throw rocks at the movie writers and novelists because
they happen to choose us as their setting,'' he said. ``I don't
think anybody except a travel writer goes out of their way to write
something positive about any particular city.''
   Fox worries more about how trade publications portray the city.
   ``They prefer to look at the business side of things,'' he said.
``They are more important to us, the marketers.''
   Demaris said it was the lure of gambling, the big hotels and
Atlantic City's history as a resort that enticed him to choose it as
the setting for ``Ricochet,'' a novel that promises to take
``readers straight to the heart of a world of greed, political
corruption, organized crime and murder.''
   Could his novel have worked in another city?
   ``No,'' said Demaris, ``because casino gambling is a part of it.
   ``I needed that atmosphere ... and I needed a kind of Mafia
family like you have down there. In New York, the Mafia has gotten
sort of small, it has kind of quieted down.''
   Kent doesn't think that kind of allure is bad for Atlantic City.
   ``What makes Atlantic City interesting to writers is the
incredible clash of extremes. You can actually see the fortunes of
people going up and down,'' he said. ``The city is far more than
multimillion-dollar casinos and run-down neighborhoods. It's
complicated, politically, economically and mostly historically.''

   The best news for fans of animated movies came
with last week's box-office report which showed big grosses for
``The Land Before Time'' and ``Oliver and Company.''
   Revival of animation, the most tedious and expensive kind of
filmmaking, has been predicted every few years. Until recently,
though, economics made animation features risky. But in their first
weekend ``The Land Before Time'' topped all releases with $7.5
million in 1,395 theaters ($5,395 average), and ``Oliver and
Company'' in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no. 4 with $4
million ($4,226 average).
   Those are big numbers, and they're likely to grow through the
holiday season. That's encouraging for the animation trade, which
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but
the nature of the audience.
   ``A large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission
price,'' said Don Bluth, who produced ``The Land before Time.''
   ``If we make a boffo with a picture, it's because we sold more
tickets.'' Bluth, who formerly worked for the Disney Co., cautiously
predicts a renaissance of animation.
   Walt Disney Pictures, which produced ``Oliver and Company,'' has
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional
facility at the Disney-MGM studio tour in Florida. Roy E. Disney,
nephew of Walt, is largely responsible for the revival. Four years
ago when Roy helped create a new management at Disney, the outlook
was dismal.
   ``Animation was dying around here,'' he said in an interview at
his studio office. ``There had been 10 years of a kind of lack of
faith in it, and a lack of direction to it. There were an awful lot
of discouraged artists working here.
   ``We were finishing up `The Black Cauldron,' which had been an
enormous seven-year effort, with the kind of strange idea of doing
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of
what the story was. There were a lot of people who thought we just
weren't going forward with the animation department. There was even
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely.''
   Disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads,
who were trained in live-action films, to the uniqueness of the
animation process.
   ``First of all, it's a matter of time; `Oliver,' for example,
took four years to complete,'' he said. His campaign was aided by
having ``The Great Mouse Detective'' in good story form. When the
movie proved a hit, all doubts were erased.
   ``Oliver and Company'' resulted from a ``Gong Show'' session in
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas.
Most were shot down, but an updated ``Oliver Twist'' survived.
Members of Fagin's gang became dogs, as was the newcomer, Oliver.
But during story development Oliver became a kitten.
   The young animators worked at a fast clip, inspired by the
casting of the voices, including Bette Midler, Billy Joel, Dom
DeLuise and Robert Loggia. Many of the new artists have come from
the Disney-endowed California Institute of the Arts, but Disney
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art.
   The studio won't reveal the cost of ``Oliver and Company,'' but
Disney said it was in the middle range for an animated feature
(estimate: $18 million). Computers will increasingly relieve some of
the tedium of inking and painting, he said, helping to bring down
expenses.
   ``But the animation of a character, hand-drawn in pencil I think
will never change,'' he said.
   Bluth, who produced ``The Land Before Time'' for $12 million,
found a way to reduce animation expense: He moved his entire studio
to Ireland because of the labor cost of animation. The Irish
government offered a 10-year commitment for tax breaks, grants for
Irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans, he said.
   ``It was like Moses leading the children of Israel out of
Egypt,'' said Bluth. ``The artists had to pull up all their stakes;
many of them sold their homes.
   ``Many of them have bought homes there, they all have Irish
accents, some have joined the Catholic church. It's a conversion to
another way of life. I don't think many plan to stay there forever.
But they have embraced the Irish society.''
   Bluth led an earlier exodus of Disney animators during the
studio's low period and produced ``The Secret of NIMH,'' a failure.
Then he combined with Steven Spielberg on ``An American Tail,'' a
rousing success. ``The Land Before Time'' also resulted from a
Spielberg idea.
   ```I can't understand why no one has made a film about
dinosaurs,''' Bluth recalled Spielberg telling him. ```It's a
natural. There is a great interest in dinosaurs. George Lucas and
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times, but we didn't
want to do it with puppets; we tried that and it didn't work.'''
   With Spielberg and Lucas as executive producers, Bluth could
hardly miss. He admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs, but he said
Spielberg told him: ```You can learn.'''
   Bluth and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating
dinosaurs: ``For instance, the brontosaurus with the long neck. It
has a little head, like a ball on a stick. It doesn't have the
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures. It all has to be done
with facial expressions.''
   But how to make the beasts move? Bluth and company reasoned that
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles, and birds evolved from
reptilian forms. So the artists copied moves from films of chickens
and turkeys.
   After the opening of ``The Land Before Time,'' Bluth returned to
the Dublin studio where production is under way on the next feature,
``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' which takes place in the hereafter.

<HEAD>Male Incest Victims Just Beginning to Talk About Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first, Dan's secret was small and shameful.
Then it festered and grew and took on a life of its own, tormenting
its keeper until it controlled his every waking hour.
   One day, Dan's secret became so ugly and overwhelming he could no
longer contain it. It came out at last: how Dan had been sexually
molested by an older brother who climbed into bed with him at age 9
and kept coming back for 10 years.
   But as terrible as it was, Dan's secret was only one piece of a
truth far more horrifying. It was like a pebble tossed in the deep,
silent pool that was his family, causing ever-widening ripples and
revelations.
   ``About 50 of my relatives have been abused. At least, those are
the ones I know about,'' said Dan, 23, who asked that his full name
not be used. ``It gets passed from generation to generation, and
nobody talks about it, and it so it never stops.''
   Dan's oldest brother, who had molested Dan, had himself been
molested by a favorite uncle. A female cousin had been molested by
her father. Dan's mother had been molested by a male relative. Other
cousins had been molested by their siblings, or other relatives.
   Dan was not alone as a male survivor of incest in his own family,
and he is not alone in the United States. A 1985 Los Angeles Times
survey found that one of every 15 adult males reported having been
sexually abused before the age of 18.
   An estimate of 15 million abused men is conservative, said
therapist Mike Lew, who works with male survivors of incest at his
Next Step Counseling and Training Center in Newton, Mass., outside
Boston.
   ``That doesn't include men who don't remember the abuse, that
doesn't include men who at this point aren't able to talk about it
yet, who are feeling too ashamed or too frightened,'' said Lew,
author of ``Victims No Longer,'' a book about recovery for male
incest survivors. ``It's just beginning to be safe enough to talk
about it.''
   Women were the first to talk about incestuous abuse, partly
because it is easier for society to accept the idea of women as
victims, Lew said.
   ``Men aren't supposed to be victims,'' he said. ``Men are
supposed to be able to handle everything, to be strong, to be
dominant. We don't know what to do with a man or boy who's been
victimized. We either define him as something other than a man or
something less than a man, or we deny the reality of the problem.''
   Hank Estrada's personal denial lasted 25 years, until the day he
discovered that the same uncle who had abused him for 12 years also
had tried to molest one of Hank's nephews.
   ``I got this nephew to tell me what had happened,'' said Estrada,
32. ``To do that, I had to share my own experience, which was very
difficult. But I didn't want him to go through what I did.''
   His sister, the boy's mother, reported the uncle to the
authorities, but because the abuse had merely been attempted and
because it was the boy's word against the uncle's, no charges were
filed.
   Estrada told his own story of abuse, which began at age 4 and
lasted until he was 16, but the statute of limitations had run out.
   ``It was a blatant denial by the system to let this man go,''
Estrada said. ``They're just waiting for him to do it again.''
   When Estrada went looking for support services for himself, ``to
show I was not the evil one for bringing all this out,'' he found
none; the only services available were for perpetrators. Two years
ago, he started PLEA _ for Prevention, Leadership, Education and
Assistance _ a Los Angeles-based group that offers support and
information to adult male survivors of abuse who are not abusers
themselves.
   A common misconception is that men who are sexually abused as
children always become perpetrators themselves, Lew said. In fact,
many male incest survivors become protectors of other people. Dan,
for example, works with the retarded.
   ``Many of the men who come for therapy come when they've become
parents or when their children reach the age they were at when they
were abused,'' Lew said. ``They come in determined that this is not
going to happen to their children. They've heard the mythology that
men who have been abused automatically become child abusers, and
they want to make sure they won't abuse children.''
   For many abused men, the idea of victimizing someone else is
horrifying. They know firsthand the terror, guilt and pain of being
a victim. They know how an abuser who is often someone a little boy
mosts trusts and loves _ father, mother, brother or uncle _ can turn
those emotions against the victim, filling him with guilt and
self-loathing.
   Dan tried to commit suicide twice. He used food as an escape; in
his sophomore year of high school, he weighed 310 pounds.
   ``The biggest reason I ate so much was hoping I could become ugly
to turn my brother off so he wouldn't touch me,'' Dan said. ``It
didn't work. It just added to my problems.''
   At 19, the abuse had become too much. ``I couldn't stand the
feeling of guilt, of shame, of hating myself for what was going on.
I knew it had to stop, and I was the only one to stop it,'' Dan
said. ``I got a gun illegally and kept it in my nightstand, and I
swore if he touched me, I would kill him.''
   Dan has since told his parents about what happened and has
confronted his brother, who denies having a problem. Estrada's
uncle, now in his 60s, still lives with his relatives and has access
to dozens of children.
   That makes it imperative for male incest survivors to tell their
stories, Estrada believes. Unless society knows that boys, too, can
be incest victims, it always will be difficult for future victims to
summon the courage to tell anyone about what is happening to them.
Break the silence: break the cycle of abuse.
   ``Most of the men who call and write me say, `I always thought I
was alone.' They're in so much pain themselves, they never thought
about their abuser doing it again, to someone else,'' Estrada said.
``It may have happened to you, and it's in the past. But it doesn't
stop there.''

<HEAD>San Diego Utility Accepts SoCal Edison's $2.5 Billion Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK EVJE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of Southern California Edison Co.
entered ``the crown jewel of service territories'' when San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. accepted its $2.5 billion buyout bid, utility
officials said.
   The stock-swap deal approved Wednesday by SDG&E directors creates
the nation's biggest public utility, and will result in lower
electricity rates for customers and higher dividends for
shareholders, Edison chairman and chief executive Howard Allen said.
   ``We have concluded that there will be savings passed on to
customers, and that this combined institution will be stronger and
better able to serve customer needs,'' said Allen, also chief
executive of Edison's unregulated parent, SCEcorp, which serves most
of Southern California.
   ``We wouldn't be going into this if we didn't think we could
produce better consumer value than each (utility) could on its own.''
   Customers of the surviving utility also will benefit from its
increased financial strength through greater market competitiveness
and more efficient energy transmission, SDG&E chairman and chief
executive Tom Page said.
   SCEcorp also has pledged to file a request for a 10 percent rate
reduction for San Diego customers with the state Public Utilities
Commission within six months of the deal's completion.
   The deal is expected to be consummated in late 1989 or early 1990
pending stockholder ratification and approval by federal and state
regulators, principally the California Public Utilities Commission.
   SCEcorp will trade 1.3 shares of its common stock for each of the
55.8 million shares of SDG&E common stock. That works out to about
$2.4 billion when calculated on SCEcorp's closing price Wednesday of
$33 a share in composite trading.
   Additionally, swaps of several classes of preferred stock would
add about $155 million to the deal, according to Rosemead-based
SCEcorp's reckoning.
   ``What we're banking on ... is that our stock will go up in value
and the dilution of Edison shareholders' (ownership in the merged
company) will be made back by a higher market price-earnings ratio
over time,'' Allen said during a news conference at SDG&E's main
building in downtown San Diego. .
   The deal would boost Edison past San Francisco's Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. as the nation's biggest public utility. It would have
4.8 million customers, a service area of 54,000 square miles
stretching from San Luis Obispo to the Mexican border, and with
$17.7 billion in assets.
   Page will be named vice president of a new San Diego division of
SCEcorp, and he and three others from the San Diego utility will
join the board of SCEcorp.
   Analysts called the offer a good one for stockholders and
customers of the San Diego company, as SCEcorp promises the deal
will boost stock dividends by 24 percent and earnings per share by
29 percent.
   Ed Tirello, who tracks the utility business for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York, estimated the merged company would save
$100 million a year in operating and maintenance costs by cutting
duplication.
   Additionally, because the combined company would use Edison's
excess capacity SDG&E would not have to undertake some $350 million
in construction to meet growing demand, he said.
   Dan Rudakas, a utility analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in
Chicago, cautioned that the benefit to SCEcorp stockholders was
uncertain until state regulators decide how to apportion any cost
savings due to operating efficiency. But San Diego consumers would
be almost certain winners, he said.
   SCEcorp made its first unsolicited bid for the San Diego utility
July 26. The price, raised twice since then, was 1.15 shares of
SCEcorp common stock for each share of SDG&E.
   The San Diego company initially refused to negotiate with its
huge suitor, preferring to pursue a previously announced merger with
Tucson (Ariz.) Electric Power Co. SDG&E later abandoned that merger
plan, however.

   The dollar fell in early European trading today as
the market waited for Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures
for November, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices rose.
   November's unemployment rate is expected to remain at about 5.3
percent.
   ``If it's a slightly better number, the dollar may rise a bit,''
said a dealer at a large Frankfurt bank.
   But a dealer in Milan, Italy, said worse-than-expected figures
would hurt the dollar and would indicate that the U.S. economy is
overheating and that the threat of inflation was strong.
   Dealers said the dollar's weakness is partly due to the strength
of the British pound. One pound cost $1.8542 in London at
midmorning, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.8480.
   ``The (British) government's high-interest-rate policy is
clear,'' the Frankfurt dealer said. ``Demand for the pound is
there.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.28 yen to a closing 121.57. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 121.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7318 West German marks, down from 1.7375; 1.4513
Swiss francs, down from 1.4548; 5.9135 French francs, down from
5.9327; 1.9552 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9590; 1,278.65 Italian
lire, down from 1,284.97; 1.1857 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1872.
   Gold prices rose on the heels of higher platinum prices, bullion
dealers said.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $424.50 a troy ounce, up
from $423.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $425.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $425.00, up from $422.30 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold spurted ahead $2.90 to close at a bid
$425.52.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.18 a troy ounce,
up from Wednesday's $6.14.

   The dollar and stock prices closed lower in cautious
trading in Tokyo today as participants awaited the release of U.S.
unemployment figures, traders said.
   The dollar opened lower at 121.28 yen, then rose slightly during
the day. It finished trading at 121.57 yen, down 0.28 yen from
Wednesday's closing, after ranging between 121.28 and 121.60 yen.
   The U.S. currency's decline in Tokyo followed an overnight drop
in New York, where the Bank of England sold dollars in an attempt to
keep the British pound from rising against the West German mark,
dealers said.
   Many market players in Tokyo remained on the sidelines ahead of
the release of the U.S. jobless rate for November, scheduled for
Friday, dealers said.
   The dollar rose in the afternoon after some trading companies
bought the currency, but was not affected strongly, a trader with
Mitsui Bank said.
   ``Dollar-yen trading is likely to remain inactive in Tokyo until
at least Monday,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Monday is the first day that Tokyo traders will be able to respond
to the U.S. jobless rate.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell back 37.44 points or 0.13 percent to 29,541.46. The index
gained 94.26 points during the morning to end the early session at a
record-high 29,673.16, but reversed direction in the afternoon.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei index closed at a record high of
29,578.90 after gaining 260.60 points.
   ``Share prices began to fall as market players became
increasingly cautious and directionless before the release of the
U.S. jobless rate,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the most immediate concern of investors was whether the
United States would raise interest rates.
   ``Today's directionless market was easily influenced whenever
participants spread rumors, including one that U.S. interest rates
were likely to rise,'' he added.
   Volume on the market's first section was an estimated 1.5 billion
shares.

   The National Economic Commission's
recommendations may come to naught, but it has become the best
sounding board around for people fed up with the seven-year deadlock
over the federal budget deficit.
   A variety of officials representing corporate America, labor
unions and various special interest groups have paraded before the
commission to raise alarms about the deficit and insist that the new
administration and Congress do something.
   Government officials, past and present, also have lent their
voices to the clamor, with many pointing to skittish financial
markets as the best reason for quick action next year.
   On Wednesday, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker echoed
concerns raised two weeks earlier by his successor at the central
bank, Alan Greenspan.
   Volcker said a failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence
by foreigners in U.S. investments which could topple the country
into a severe recession.
   ``We are, entirely unnecessarily in my view, undercutting the
economic foundation of United States world leadership,'' Volcker
said.
   Two weeks ago, Greenspan told the commission that the need to
deal with the deficit is becoming ever more urgent because the huge
tide of red ink has begun to ``eat away at the foundations of our
economic strength.''
   Another government official, Charles Bowsher, head of the General
Accounting Office, told the advisory panel Wednesday that just
holding the growth of spending to the level of inflation, as has
been suggested by President-elect George Bush, would not be enough
to get the deficit under control.
   He said consideration will have to be given to raising taxes,
something Bush has vowed he will not do, to go along with further
cuts in government spending.
   ``There are no painless ways to cut spending or increase
revenues,'' Bowsher said. ``When the long-term health of our
nation's economy is at stake, everything must be negotiable,
including defense spending, entitlements and taxes.''
   Volcker told the panel that he favors boosting the gasoline tax,
saying that even if the tax were raised 50 cents per gallon over the
next several years, Americans would still be paying far less for
fuel than residents of most other countries.
   A boost in the gasoline tax was also proposed Wednesday by the
Council on Competitiveness, composed of 157 chief executives from
business, organized labor and higher education.
   The group said a combination of tax increases and spending cuts
should be used to slash the deficit by $120 billion by 1993. The
deficit in the just-completed fiscal year was $155.1 billion.
   ``The budget deficit is the nation's No. 1 economic problem,''
said John Young, chairman of the council and head of Hewlett-Packard
Co. ``We are concerned that the stability of global financial
markets will continue to be shaken by a belief that the deficit is a
politically intractable problem.''
   The 12-member economic commission is still awaiting word on the
names of the two persons Bush will appoint to the panel. Officials
say those appointments will indicate whether the president-elect
intends to use the advisory group in a serious effort to reduce the
budget deficit.
   Bush has said he will make the appointments some time in December
but he has sidestepped questions about how seriously he will take
any report the panel adopts.
   While the group by law is scheduled to develop a deficit
reduction plan by March 1, Bush has the power to postpone the report
until Sept. 1.
   House Speaker Jim Wright told the panel Wednesday that he hoped
it would be allowed to complete its work by March 1 so that it would
have a major impact on the congressional budget deliberations. He
also urged Bush to submit his own budget plan by mid-February,
incorporating any changes he considers necessary to the document
Reagan will send Congress on Jan. 9.
   ``We do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule,'' Wright
said. ``The problems won't wait indefinitely while people try to
read our lips or read our minds.''

   ``We have enjoyed _ are still enjoying _ an unprecedented period
of economic expansion in peacetime. At the same time, there can be
no dodging the facts of anemic savings, extraordinarily high current
consumption, rapidly growing indebtedness internally and externally,
slack growth in productivity, a depreciating currency and renewed
inflation.
   ``Taken together, those factors undermine prospects for longterm
growth and aggravate more immediate economic risks, but they also
undercut public and congressional support for sustaining our
military strength, maintaining open markets and free flows of
international investment, and for efforts to encourage development
of much poorer nations.''

   HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT: ``If the problem is formidable, so are
our resources. Polls also show that the people are willing to pay as

of the politicians. In tiptoeing around the problem, inventing
creative euphemisms and pretending to believe in pretty illusions,

that will cost at least $200 billion more than the funds that are
likely to be available. On top of that are the cost overruns that we
see looming on the horizon. The simple fact is that our defense
plans do not yet reflect the limits on what is affordable.

   The government should spend $30 billion next
year to close the nation's 100 worst savings institutions and stop
more than $1 billion a month in losses, a top bank regulator says.
   ``We need to close the worst first,'' Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said in a speech Wednesday at the
National Press Club.
   ``Once these 100 or so worst institutions are liquidated, the
other problem institutions can be dealt with over a somewhat longer
period,'' he said, outlining the conclusions of an FDIC study that
will be published within two weeks.
   Seidman joins former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and
Congress' General Accounting Office, in arguing that it will be
cheaper in the long run to spend heavily now to close failing
savings and loan institutions.
   His recommendation is an implicit criticism of the approach taken
so far by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is
technically insolvent and lacks the cash to pay off depositors or
make good on all S&L losses.
   So far this year, FSLIC has ``resolved'' the cases of 147 S&Ls,
most through rescues put together with guarantees and promissory
notes committing money it does not have now but expects to receive
over the next 30 years.
   Seidman, whose agency insures deposits in commercial banks, not
S&Ls, said he does not oppose allowing an institution to remain open
if it is economically viable, but that the losses should be cleaned
up immediately and not allowed to continue.
   ``He's saying that they should have had more money and they
should have closed more institutions,'' said Mark J. Riedy,
president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade
group.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for M. Danny Wall, chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's 3,000
S&Ls, said, ``All we can do is play with the hand we've been dealt
and that hand provides us with certain resources. ... This Congress
and this administration have to determine where we go from here.''
   Seidman did not directly call for a taxpayer bailout, but said
``government resources'' must be used because even the first $30
billion of what is estimated to be a $50 billion to $100 billion
problem is beyond the capacity of the S&L industry to pay.
   However, he said several methods could be used to keep most of
the FSLIC rescue ``off budget,'' providing a large sum quickly but
spreading the fiscal drain over several years. One method involves
selling bonds and having the Treasury pay the interest.
   But James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, the largest industry lobby group, said even if
the bank board received $30 billion next year, it would be difficult
to spend it efficiently.
   ``I have a question as to whether they can move that quickly,''
he said. ``It would be wonderful if they could, but I'm not
convinced.''
   The FDIC also examined the broader issue of deposit insurance.
Both the FDIC and the FSLIC guarantee deposits up to $100,000.
Seidman said deposit insurance is needed because it prevents bank
runs that could bring down the entire financial system.
   Suggestions from academics that deposit insurance be scrapped or
reduced are impractical, Seidman said, but he offered several ideas
to keep the government's liabilities from mounting:
   _Taking deposit insurance agencies out of the federal budget so
they are less subject to political pressure.
   _Giving the insurance funds the power to raise the fee charged to
member institutions after bad years and, eventually, perhaps the
power to charge individual institutions different fees based on
their records.
   _Speeding up the process for revoking an institution's insurance
from two years to six months.
   _Making solvent banks owned by holding companies responsible for
the losses of other banks held by the same parent.
   _Establishing regional committees of regulators and bankers to
evaluate whether institutions are overly exposed to risk in one
region or one sector of the economy, such as oil drilling.

<HEAD>AT&T Long-Distance Rates to Drop, Local to Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local telephone rates are going up today, and
AT&T's long-distance prices are going down, soon to be followed by
those of rivals US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications
Corp.
   This script has been replayed several times in recent years as
part of an effort by federal regulators to shift the costs of the
local phone network to local customers.
   For about half of all customers, long-distance price cuts of 38
percent since 1984 have more than offset the rise in local rates,
according to the Federal Communications Commission. Those in the
other half, however, don't call long-distance enough to benefit.
Instead, their overall bill is higher.
   Beginning today, customers will see another 60 cents added to
their monthly local phone bill, and American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. will drop its basic interstate long-distance rates an average of
3.8 percent.
   US Sprint said it will drop its rates Jan. 1 an average 3.85
percent, about the same for business as for residential customers.
MCI expects to announce details of a price cut next month.
   AT&T is able to make its $697 million annual reduction, and US
Sprint and MCI theirs, because costs of connecting to the local
network are being reduced by the corresponding increase in
customers' monthly bills.
   With today's 60-cent increase, the subscriber line charge has
risen to $3.20. The federal charge, imposed in 1985, is designed to
reduce the subsidy long-distance companies pay to maintain the local
network.
   A customer who makes about $5.20 per month in direct-dialed
long-distance calls saves enough to offset the effects of the line
charge, according to James L. Lande in the FCC's industry analysis
division,
   ``About half the people are at least breaking even,'' he said.
   AT&T will cut its basic long-distance rates for calls traveling
more than 124 miles by 3.8 percent. It will make smaller cuts in
rates for interstate calls of shorter distances, which account for
about one-quarter of AT&T interstate calls.
   The largest among the price cuts will go to large volume users,
both residential and business.
   Rates for Reach Out America, AT&T's long-distance calling plan
for residential customers, will be cut 4.9 percent.
   AT&T WATS rates will drop 4 percent and the company will
restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and
distance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This
price reduction is to take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the
others.
   Rates for AT&T's three PRO WATS calling plans for business
customers will be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates will
drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates will go down 4.5 percent.
   Basic AT&T 800 service prices will go down 3.6 percent, and
Software Defined Network Service rates will see an overall reduction
of 6.2 percent.

<HEAD>Illinois Dealer Argues Jury Was `Hostile' To Odometer Tampering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Illinois auto dealer who turned back the
mileage of used cars he sold was the victim ``of the jury's
hostility toward odometer tampering,'' his lawyer told the U.S.
Supreme Court in arguing that the dealer's mail fraud conviction was
excessive.
   ``The only fraud here was odometer tampering,'' attorney Peter L.
Steinberg told the court Wednesday, saying that dealer Wayne T.
Schmuck of Harvard, Ill., should have been convicted of misdemeanor
rather than felony counts.
   Schmuck, who did business as Big Foot Auto Sales of Harvard,
Ill., was accused in Wisconsin of altering the mileage readings of
the cars to increase their value. The charges stemmed from cars sold
wholesale to Wisconsin auto dealers.
   Courts have held that mail fraud charges can be brought in cases
where the mail is necessary to the success of odometer tampering
schemes.
   Steinberg, who practices in Madison, Wis., also said a federal
district judge in Madison erred by refusing to advise jurors they
could have considered finding Schmuck guilty of a lesser offense.
   Steinberg said his client should have been found guilty of
odometer tampering, a misdemeanor punishable by a $50,000 fine and a
year in prison. Instead he was convicted in December 1983 of 12
counts of mail fraud, a federal felony carrying a maximum penalty of
a $1,000 fine, five years' imprisonment or both, and later was
sentenced to 90 days in jail and four years' probation.
   ``We were the victims of the jury's hostility toward odometer
tampering,'' he said. ``The feeling was: `He's certainly guilty. We
have to convict him of something.'''
   ``We would have been happy to take 12 counts of odometer
tampering,'' Steinberg said. ``It's a misdemeanor. The fine is
$50,000. That's 50 times worse than mail fraud, but it's only a year
in prison.''
   Steinberg said his client did not use the mails, and instead
hand-delivered paperwork making false mileage statements on the cars
he sold to unsuspecting auto dealers.
   Retail customers who bought the cars from the dealerships then
would mail title and registration papers to the Wisconsin Department
of Motor Vehicles, and the lawyer said it was sending those
documents which constituted fraudulent use of the mails.
   ``Is every person who tampers with an odometer going to be guilty
of mail fraud when someone on down the line mails in a
registration?'' he asked.
   ``You have to be able to point out how the mailing contributed to
the success of the scheme,'' Steinberg said. ``Otherwise you open
the flood gate for prosecutions.''
   Attorney Brian J. Martin, an assistant to the U.S. Solicitor
General, argued that Schmuck could not operate a fraudulent business
successfully for two years without using the mails, since his
customers would not buy cars unless they could be registered.
   ``The sale cannot be made without the title being sent to the
state department of transportation,'' Martin said. ``The sale was
made. The dealers came back for more.''
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next
year.

<HEAD>Dual Pipeline Plan For Pumping Canadian Natural Gas To Northeast
Is
OK'd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal official says he approved plans to
build two major pipelines to deliver Canadian natural gas throughout
the Northeast because of ``an urgent and necessary requirement'' for
the additional energy supplies.
   Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administrative law judge at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, also said Wednesday that
timing was critical because the Canadian gas would be lost to other
markets if the projects were delayed.
   The plan calls for the construction of a 369.4-mile pipeline from
the U.S.-Canadian border near Iroquois, Ontario, through New York
and Connecticut, across the Long Island Sound and ending at South
Commack, Long Island, where it will be connected with existing
pipeline from the Long Island Lighting Co.
   Another section of the Iroquois project would be a 53.2-mile
pipeline loop in New York and Massachusetts and a third section near
Carthage, New York.
   The second project, the Champlain pipeline, would be a 339.3-mile
stretch from the Canadian border near Philipsburg, Quebec, through
Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, ending near West Medway,
Mass., outside Boston.
   ``The settlement ... is clearly in the public interest,'' he
wrote ``There is an urgent and necessary requirement for additional
supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of individuals and the
economy in the New England, New York and New Jersey areas at the
earliest possible date.''
   Wagner recommended the full commission approve the plan, which
involves eight companies. Spokeswoman Tamara Young-Allen said the
earliest vote would be Jan. 11.
   Eight companies are involved in the projects. They are Iroquois
Gas Transmission System, Champlain Pipeline Co., CNG Transmission
Corp., TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.,
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., ANR Pipeline Co. and Texas Eastern
Transmission Corp.
   A Connecticut environmental group, the Housatonic Valley
Association, opposed the plan, as did the New England Fuel Institute
and Empoire State Petroleum Association.
   Wagner also approved a third project, a 90.5 mile stretch of new
pipeline from existing lines near Muncie, Ind., and Lebanon, Ohio.

<HEAD>MIT Moves To Commercialize New Superconductors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has won
an early heat in a race to commercialize new superconductors that
many scientists believe will eventually be used to probe the brain,
detect submarines and help find oil.
   But researchers at other university and corporate laboratories
said Wednesday the race, which could bring huge financial gains to
the winner, is far from over.
   MIT received a ``notice of allowability'' from the U.S. Patent
Office last week for the first major U.S. patent in the field of
high-temperature superconductors, materials that conduct electricity
with virtually no resistance.
   MIT officials said the notice is a strong signal that the
institute will receive a patent within a few months for a process
developed by two professors, Gregory J. Yurek and John B. Vander
Sande, to make ceramic superconductors more flexible by mixing them
with metals like gold or silver.
   Researchers around the world have been competing to develop and
apply ceramic superconductors since they were discovered in January
1986 by two scientists at an International Business Machines Inc.
laboratory in Switzerland.
   The IBM scientists, Georg Bednorz and Alexander Mueller, won the
1987 Nobel Prize in physics for their discovery that certain
ceramics become superconductive when cooled with liquid nitrogen to
about 300 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Previous superconductors had operated only at minus 418 degrees
or below, requiring cooling in liquid helium, which is more costly
and difficult to maintain than liquid nitrogen.
   One problem with the ceramics is that they are brittle. MIT says
its process greatly increases flexibility, allowing the materials to
be made into wire and wound into coils for small motors.
   Several other applications for patents related to ceramic
superconductors are pending, but none have been granted, said Oscar
Maston, a spokesman for the Patent Office in Arlington, Va.
   Bell Labs and other companies and universities are working on
processes similar to MIT's, said Paul A. Fleury, director of
physical research at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J.
   ``The MIT technique is significant in that it's one of the
earliest,'' Fleury said, ``but it's still too early to tell which,
if any, of these processes is going to result in a commercial
application.''
   William J. Gallagher, manager of exploratory cryogenics at IBM's
research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said researchers can
easily foresee using the new superconductors in devices to measure
brainwaves, locate submarines deep under the sea, detect oil
reserves and process radar signals.
   But those uses are probably at least five years away, Gallagher
said, and many problems with superconductors will have to be solved
first. Among them, he said, are limits to the amount of current the
new materials can carry.
   MIT said it has licensed exclusive rights to its patent to a
company founded last year by four of the institute's faculty
members. MIT officials refused to disclose the terms of the
licensing agreement with the company, American Superconductor Corp.
of Cambridge.

<HEAD>China Delays Opening of First Futures Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will delay for a year the opening of the
socialist world's first futures market, an official daily said
Thursday.
   The China Daily said a futures market will be launched on a trial
basis in central China's Henan province by the end of next year.
   In May, plans were announced to open a market in the southern
city of Canton by the end of 1988, but the daily said an
investigative group under the State Council, China's cabinet,
decided to put off the starting date.
   Chang Qing, senior researcher in the group, said China wanted
more time to learn from experts in Hong Kong and become better
prepared.
   A futures market, formerly regarded in China as a form of
capitalist speculation, allows traders and producers of raw
materials to negotiate a set price for what they think a commodity
will be worth at a future date.
   The producer is guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent
fluctuations in the market.
   The need for futures markets has arisen with the decontrol of
prices for many commodities that has resulted in sharp price
fluctuations. Produce markets in particular have been plagued by
gluts and shortages caused by farmers' inability to forecast the
market.
   The daily said the market in Henan, a major agriculture center,
will deal in wheat and other grains. About 150 people, mostly from
Henan, recently gathered in Beijing for a 10-day training course in
futures markets, it said.
   The Henan market will only open prices to trading twice a week
because of China's backward telecommunications system, it said.
   If it is a success, markets will be opened in Jilin in the
northeast for corn, Sichuan in the west for pigs and Guangdong and
Hebei in the south and north for raw materials.
   It said the investigative group is studying whether foreign
businessmen will be allowed to participate in China's futures
markets. Initially, only Chinese will be able to take part, it said.

<TEXT>
   The government said today its chief forecasting
gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in
October after falling a month earlier.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators had
previously been estimated as falling only 0.1 percent in September,
but today's report revised that downturn to minus 0.3 percent.
   Economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing
to slower growth, but they have been hard-pressed to find much sign
of it yet.
   Other statistics for October, the latest available, all look very
strong. Unemployment is at a 14-year low, factories are using more
of their capacity than at any time in 8{ years and personal income
posted its steepest increase in a year.
   ``The message is clear that the fourth quarter is starting out
very well. ... There are no particular imbalances ... (and) that
suggests the economy should keep on expanding nicely for another six
to nine months,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist for The Boston Co.
   However, the leading index is ``clearly signaling a slowdown'' in
the second half of next year, he said in advance of today's report.
Over the last 12 months, it's risen only 0.5 percent, compared with
a gain of 6.0 percent for the previous 12-month period. It was the
smallest October-to-October increase since 1979-80, beore the last
recession.
   In October, four of nine available indicators were pointing to
faster growth, while five were pointing to slower growth.
   The factors pushing the index up, in order of magnitude, were an
increase in building permits, a rise in stock prices, a jump in new
orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial
claims for state unemployment insurance.
   The negative factors, ordered from largest to smallest, were
faster deliveries to companies, a sign of slackening demand; a drop
in the price of industrial materials; a decline in the
inflation-adjusted money supply; a shortening in the length of the
average workweek, and a fall in orders for business equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 193.0 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago, said the index's prediction of slower
growth is not necessarily false.
   Some sort of moderation, given the current bouyancy, is not
unlikely in the last half of 1989, he said. ``However, I would not
leap to the conclusion that a recession is coming,'' he said.
   Given current economic conditions, a significant slowdown or
recession won't occur until the Federal Reserve Board pushes
interest rates sharply higher, he said.
   The Fed, fearing that too-strong demand will push prices higher,
has been trying to slow expansion of the gross national product, the
broadest measure of the economy's health, to a non-inflationary 2
percent to 2.5 percent.
   The GNP grew at a moderate 2.6 percent annual pace in the third
quarter, down from a 3.2 percent pace in the first half of 1988.
   However, most analysts were expecting it to pick up again in the
first three months of next year when the negative effects from the
summer drought are no longer acting as a drag. That would put the
economy well into the middle of its seventh year of expansion, a
peacetime record.
   The leading index, before falling in September, rose 0.5 percent
in August and fell 0.8 percent in July. It rose 1.6 percent in June
and dropped 0.7 percent in May.
   Economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the
index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly
predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row.
However, it has also falsely predicted a recession four times.
   Preliminary estimates of the index are often revised
substantially in later months. For instance, declines were initially
reported for five consecutive months _ from September 1987 through
January _ but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops.

   About 530 workers at a Chrysler Canada trim
plant will lose their jobs beginning in January shortly after the
U.S. automaker closes its Kenosha, Wis., factory, a company
spokesman said today.
   ``This is a projection at this point, but that looks like the
number,'' said Walt McCall.
   Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. automaker and the parent company
of Chrysler Canada, has said it will close the plant in Kenosha on
Dec. 23 and lay off more than 5,000 workers.
   The trim plant in Ajax, just east of Toronto, employs about 2,000
people and makes interior components for many of Chrysler's North
American plants. The layoffs will be completed by July.
   ``No one likes to see this, but it's a cyclical business and it
happens,'' McCall said.

<HEAD>Philippine Lawsuit A Smokescreen, Westinghouse Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. says safety
concerns raised by the Aquino government over a nuclear reactor in
the Philippines amount to a smokescreen to disguise political
opposition to the project begun by former President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Westinghouse officials said Wednesday they expected the lawsuit
over the $2.3 billion plant, for which the company has been paid
$680 million as prime contractor. Westinghouse claims it is due
another $20 million to $30 million.
   The government of President Corazon Aquino announced early today
that it had sued Westinghouse in U.S. District Court in Newark,
N.J., to cancel the contract for the 620-megawatt plant, which was
finished three years ago but was never started.
   Westinghouse said today it petitioned the International Chamber
of Commerce in Paris to arbitrate the dispute as provided by the
1976 contract.
   Nathaniel D. Woodson, general manager of the Westinghouse nuclear
fuels unit, and Westinghouse Deputy General Counsel Louis J.
Briskman said Philippine officials have acknowledged during private
talks that no matter how safe the plant is, they don't intend to
allow nuclear power production in the country.
   ``It has nothing to do with safety,'' Woodson said.
   The government says the plant, 60 miles northwest of Manila in
Bataan province, is unsafe partly because of its design and its
location on an earthquake fault and near a volcano.
   The reactor's opponents also allege bribes were paid over the
awarding of the prime contract for the plant.
   ``What we're finding here are the results of a political policy
that came to life when they were running for office,'' Woodson said.
``They now feel they have a political albatross around their neck
and they're trying to blame us.''
   President Aquino's legal adviser, Adolfo Azcuna, said in late
October that the suit was ready and likely would be filed within a
month in the United States. In addition, a standstill agreement
barring either the government or the company from taking legal
action expired today.
   Westinghouse officials said the 10-year-old controversy is an
unfounded attack on the company's international standing as a
designer and builder of nuclear power plants.
   ``All over the world we have built plants, and we haven't had
this problem. If they don't want to operate this plant, that's their
decision, but don't make Westinghouse a scapegoat,'' he said.
``Westinghouse will not be a scapegoat.''
   The company cites investigations by the U.S. Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which produced no
evidence to warrant charges.
   A safety study commissioned by the Aquino government _ a draft of
which was published by a trade journal _ concluded the plant is
safe, Westinghouse said. But the government says the final report
concludes otherwise, although Philippine officials have refused to
release the document.
   Communist rebels have bombed the transmission towers leading from
the plant, and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap,
Woodson said. The plant's corps of operators has largely disbanded,
and Westinghouse has only a handful of employees still in the
Philippines, he said.
   Furthermore, the cost of the plant continues rising, Westinghouse
said. Interest on the loans the Philippine government took to build
the plant cost an estimated $300,000 per day.

   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits
owner Al Copeland today extended the deadline on his offer for
Church's Fried Chicken Inc., saying he did so to get time to put out
a court-ordered statement.
   He also said that, since announcing his buyout plans, he has been
offered 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the 35.97 million
shares outstanding.
   He already owned 3.2 percent of the San Antonio-based company's
stock, so the stock tendered by Nov. 30 would give him nearly 44
percent, said Rob Shepardson, a spokesman for Copeland.
   The previous deadline for the takeover bid had been midnight EST
on Wednesday, but A. Copeland Enterprises Inc. said in a prepared
statement today that it had put off the deadline until midnight EST
on Dec. 16.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz has forbidden Popeyes to buy
Church's stock until 10 working days after it reveals information on
which its buyout offer is made. He also ordered Popeyes on Tuesday
to stop using, at least for now, any confidential Church's
information it may have.
   Church's claims its former chief financial officer took
confidential files with him when he went to work for Copeland.
   Church's announced Tuesday that it was starting preliminary
negotiations with third parties that it did not identify.
   ``We do not understand how you can adequately explore
alternatives available to Church's without allowing us to
participate in such discussions on equal footing with all other
interested parties,'' Copeland wrote the board late Wednesday.
   The letter said that so far, Church's has said it will talk to
Copeland and let him see the documents he wants only if he signs a
standstill agreement. Such agreements bind the potential buyer to a
promise not to pursue the takeover attempt for a specific period,
usually years.
   Such an agreement is unnecessary, Copeland's letter said, because
he is willing to sign a confidentiality agreement requiring that any
further purchases of stock be made pursuant to the tender offer.
   The letter also said Copeland plans to go forward with his offer
after complying with Schwartz' order.
   And he repeated that he is willing to raise his $290 million,
$8-per-share bid, if the nonpublic information he wants justifies a
higher price.

   The RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover war ended in
stunning triumph for buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., whose record $24.53 billion agreement derailed a fatter rival
bid by the management group that triggered the corporate
free-for-all more than a month ago.
   The $109-a-share offer approved by RJR directors late Wednesday
capped a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left the
unprecedented auction for the nation's 19th largest industrial
company in utter confusion.
   RJR said Kohlberg's offer of $81 in cash, $18 in stock and
additional securities worth $10 beat out a last-minute offer valued
at $112 a share, or $25.2 billion, by chief executive F. Ross
Johnson's management group.
   Although the face value of the management offer looked higher,
RJR stated that its board of directors concluded the Kohlberg offer
was worth substantially the same.
   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of all
directors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the best
interest of the company and its shareholders,'' RJR said.
   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed
money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was pleased with
the decision that ended the biggest takeover brawl in history.
   The value of Kohlberg's offer was nearly double that of the
previous record, a $13.4 billion takeover of Gulf Corp. by Chevron
Corp. in March 1984.
   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end so
that the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and the
communities it serves, can be assured that business will now return
to normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's two
principals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in a statement.
   Kohlberg's triumph raised the prospect that at least some
businesses in one of the biggest consumer product companies might be
sold to help the investment firm pay for the acquisition.
   It gave no indication what, if any, of RJR's worldwide operations
might be for sale. But there was speculation that possible
candidates included some or even all of RJR's food segments, which
would return the company to the tobacco business roots that still
account for about 40 percent of its sales.
   Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer products
companies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. It makes
well-known brands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat
cereal to Life Savers candy.
   The size and complexity of the RJR deal has raised major
questions about the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and other
debt-financed restructurings that are transforming much of corporate
America and whether it has gone too far.
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. recently agreed to acquire Kraft Inc. for
$12.6 billion. Still pending are multibillion-dollar battles over
Pillsbury Co., Holly Farms Corp., the nation's third-largest poultry
processor; and textile maker West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   The RJR deal also signaled a spectacular defeat by its chief
executive F. Ross Johnson, whose management group began the takeover
struggle Oct. 20 with a $75 a share offer that was later raised five
times.
   His tenure at the company remained uncertain. However, the
Atlanta Constitution reported today that Kohlberg would install
RJR's former chairman and chief executive officer, J. Paul Sticht,
in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition. The
newspaper said Kohlberg would move the company's corporate
headquarters back to Winston-Salem, N.C.
   It also wasn't clear as of late Wednesday whether Johnson, a
scrappy, daring adversary, would try to reopen what already has
proven to be an extremely unpredictable battle. The New York Times
quoted him in today's editions as saying, ``I am proud of the fact
that we put the best bid on the table the first time and this time.''
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., one of Johnson's key financial
partners, said in a statemet today, ``From what we know, our bid was
the best. We are mystified about the process and the standards that
the board used to reach its decision. We are going to continue to
keep our options open.''
   Earlier in the day Wednesday, Johnson's group made an effort to
raise its bid after a company-decreed deadline for all offers had
expired. The move temporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billion
Kohlberg Kravis offer that the RJR board was about to approve.
   That development made the already unwieldy auction even more
chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were getting
equal treatment. It also sent RJR's stock $2.25 higher Wednesday in
frenzied New York Stock Exchange trading to $93 a share, on the
possibility the auction would be prolonged. In early trading today,
RJR was off 75 cents to $92.25 a share.
   Sources familiar with the bidding said the offer of a third
contender, First Boston Corp. was rejected as too tentative,
although the bidder valued it as high as $115 a share or $25.87
billion.
   A crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash eang homes,
said the report ``is misleading _ it is going to confuse the
public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard.
   But Elma Holder, executive director of the National Citizens'
Coalition on Nursing Home Reform, said: ``We think the national
statistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''

<HEAD>Leading Index Up Slightly In October</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to update with construction spending
report; picks up 2nd graf pvs, ``The Commerce...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending rose 0.9 percent, its heftiest increase in
three months, with widespread gains reported in housing, government
and commercial building, the government reported today.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity rose a tiny 0.1
percent in October after falling a month earlier.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$409.2 billion in October following a 0.7 percent increase in
September and a 0.2 percent rise in August. It was the best showing
since a 1.5 percent jump in July.
   But despite the recent increases, construction activity has been
modest this year, advancing 2.1 percent in the past 12 months.
Taking a 1.7 percent rise in construction costs into account,
activity increased only 0.4 percent over the past 12 months.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators had
previously been estimated as falling only 0.1 percent in September,
but today's report revised that downturn to minus 0.3 percent.
   The leading index, before edging down in September, rose 0.5
percent in August and fell 0.7 percent in July after dropping in May.
   Economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing
to slower growth, but they have been hard-pressed to find much sign
of it lately. Other statistics for October, the latest available,
have been strong, including one showing unemployment at a 14-year
low.
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that personal
income increased 1.8 percent, the biggest rise since October 1987,
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.18 trillion last month.
   The gain followed modest increases of 0.5 percent in September
and 0.4 percent in August.
   The numbers raised some concerns about inflation, but a separate
report to the Federal Reserve Board indicated the economy was
slowing down.
   In a review of the economy based on assessments from the 12
regional Federal Reserve banks, the Fed reported ``an apparently
slower pace'' of growth, moderate wage increases and slightly eased
price pressures in several manufacturing industries.
   Financial markets rallied, interpreting the report as a signal
that Fed members were less worried about inflation than previously
thought, and therefore less likely to boost interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 12.98 to
2,114.51, giving the well-known barometer a gain of nearly 40 points
over the past three sessions.
   The government attributed about half of last month's increase in
income to farm subsidy payments and bonuses to auto workers.
However, excluding those factors, income still would have risen a
hefty 0.9 percent.
   ``This throws cold water on the view the economy slowed down
much,'' said John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``It may have taken a bit of a pause
in August and September, but it came roaring back in October.''
   The concern in financial markets has been that growth is too
strong. High levels of employment will lead to higher wages, and
strong consumer demand will lead to higher prices, they fear.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, was up a robust 0.8 percent to an annual
rate of $3.30 trillion following a weak 0.1 percent rise in
September.
   The biggest spending increase last month was for services, up 1.4
percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase for non-durable goods.
Spending on durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, fell 0.6 percent.
   With income rising faster than spending, Americans saved more
than in any month since October 1987. The personal savings rate _
savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 5.2 percent, up
from 4.2 percent in September.
   Disposable, or after-tax income, was up 1.9 percent last month,
also the largest increase in a year, after rising 0.6 percent a
month earlier.

<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago-based Farley Inc. today extended
for a second time its $1.4 billion tender offer for Georgia-based
West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   The offer was to expire at midnight Wednesday, but a Farley
statement said it was being extended by one week to midnight EST
Dec. 7.
   The company also announced that a preliminary count showed about
11.4 million shares of Pepperell's common stock had been tendered by
stockholders as of the close of business Wednesday. With the shares
Farley already owns, that would give the company about 49 percent of
Pepperell's stock, it said.
   Farley officials have declined to say how much of the Georgia
company's stock they hope to acquire.
   ``We are pleased with the results of the tender offer to date,
and believe they reflect the shareholders' increasing interest and
confidence in our proposal to acquire West Point-Pepperell,'' said
William Farley, chairman of the Chicago-based company. ``We are
confident our offer will succeed, despite the efforts by Pepperell
management to impede it.''
   Pepperell's stock was up $1.12{ a share to $40 on the New York
Stock Exchange Wednesday.
   Farley, the Chicago-based maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear,
originally set Nov. 21 as the deadline for its $48-per-share offer
for the textile company based in West Point. The deadline was
extended to midnight Wednesday as Farley attempted to overcome some
of the anti-takeover obstacles set up by Pepperell.
   Pepperell and Farley have done battle in court over Pepperell's
``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan, designed to thwart hostile
takeovers.
   Last week, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied
Pepperell's motion to reinstate certain key provisions of the plan,
which were thrown out earlier by a U.S. District Court judge.
   The appeals court scheduled a hearing the week of Jan. 9 to
determine the final fate of the ``poison pill'' plan. Farley's offer
is contingent on getting the plan overturned.
   Also being argued in the courts is the constitutionality of
Georgia's anti-takeover statute, which Farley is seeking to
overturn. That issue is now in the hands of U.S. District Judge G.
Ernest Tidwell of Atlanta, who has not set a hearing date. If the
law is upheld, Farley's bid cannot go through.

<TEXT>
   A former Connecticut bank president who earlier was
sentenced to four months in prison for insider trading drew a longer
sentence for trying to block an investigation into his activities.
   Robert C. DiGennaro, who was chief executive of Suffield
Financial Corp., was sentenced to a year and a day in prison
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Boston. The two sentences will
run concurrently.
   Prosecutors say that while his bank was negotiating a 1986 merger
with Coastal Savings Bank of Portland, Maine, DiGennaro tipped off a
number of associates about the pending transaction.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Crossen said that when the
Securities and Exchange Commission looked into the matter,
``DiGennaro lied, convinced others to lie and destroyed documents
that had been subpoenaed.''
   DiGennaro's associates pleaded guilty but were not sent to jail.
   Wednesday, the SEC filed civil complaints in court against two
people who profited from DiGennaro's information and both agreed to
pay fines.
   Arthur Silverman, a former Hartford stockbroker, agreed to pay
back profits of $9,100 and a penalty of $18,000. He was barred from
the securities industry for six month. In June, he agreed to pay a
fine of $10,000 for insider trading.
   Joel Weisman, a Hartford business, agreed to pay back profits of
$33,000. He was not fined because he cooperated with the
government's investigation.

   The ``Miracle on 34th Street'' is more than just
a movie to postal workers who have borrowed the slogan to describe
how thousands of people are helped each year when they write to
Santa.
   ``Over the past years, we've had a number of startling
successes,'' said Postmaster John M. Nolan, noting that families
have been reunited through the letters and one person received an
eye operation. ``Every year, we kind of have a miracle on 34th
Street here.'' New York's main post office is a massive
neo-classical building on Eighth Avenue with its north side on 34th
Street.
   The post office kicked off this year's campaign Wednesday,
although 4,000 of an expected 18,000 letters to Santa from the less
fortunate around the world have already been received.
   Last year, more than 16,000 letters to Santa from about 10
countries, many addressed to the North Pole and bearing a New York
zip code, ended up at the main post office's dead letter unit. Good
Samaritans answered about 14,000 of them, Nolan said.
   New York postal employees, with the public's help, have been
granting Christmas wishes for 60 years.

a letter anyway,'' confessed Mark, who lives in a Manhattan welfare
hotel. ``For Christmas, could you please bring my mother a coat? ...
My teacher gave her one, but it didn't fit.''
   ``My husband is a junkie and he left us with nothing,'' wrote a
mother of three in Brooklyn. ``So I left him and moved in with my
mom and dad. It's embarrassing enough that I can't afford to get my
kids anything.''
   ``I budget for one meal a day,'' said a Bronx woman who is
raising three children and a grandchild on a salary of $2.35 an
hour. ``It drives me crazy sometimes and I feel like the world wants
to come down.''
   ``We don't vouch for the exact accuracy or need,'' said Nolan,
but he feels most of the letters are legitimate.
   About 25 grade-school children, many of them welfare hotel
residents, chatted with Santa during a news conference to launch the
volunteer drive.
   Ellen Hernandez, 9, said she wanted ``a baby girl'' for
Christmas. ``Santa doesn't give baby girls. We can give you a baby
doll, though,'' he replied jovially.
   ``Lose some weight,'' advised Tiffany Rodriguez, 8, but St. Nick
said he couldn't make such a promise.
   Volunteers can get letters to answer by calling, writing or going
to the main post office.
   The 1947 film ``Miracle on 34th Street'' tells the story of a
lawyer who proves the existence of Santa Claus using as evidence the
bags and bags of letters the U.S. Postal Service delivered to him.
The Santa in question worked at Macy's department store, which also
is on 34th Street in Manhattan.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
modestly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade with most of the
selling due to technical factors, analysts said.
   ``The market seems to be pretty fickle right now,'' said Steve
Freed, a grain market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   But some observers also linked the decline to recurring rumors
that the Agriculture Department may delay offering subsidized U.S.
wheat to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have agreed to purchase 9 million metric tons of U.S.
grain, including 4 million tons of wheat, this year and next year
under an agreement signed Monday.
   The Soviets have purchased no wheat for delivery in the current
marketing year and the USDA has not offered them wheat since the
signing of the grain deal, as the agency had been expected to do.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.20 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.60\ a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 2} cents lower with December at $1.94 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 5\ cents lower with January at $7.60 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December
at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent
higher with January at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 40.02 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .40 cent higher with
February at 44.75 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed mostly lower on Wednesday while pork
futures were mostly higher.

   The stock market drifted mostly lower today as
investors awaited the November employment statistics due to be
released Friday for an indication of the strength of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on
Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, was
down 4.27 at 2,110.24 at noon on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 5 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 528 up, 752 down
and 504 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 59.89 million shares at noontime
compared with 60.78 million shares at the same point in Wednesday's

   The market rallied in the previous session on indications that
the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace.
   That presumably would mean that the Federal Reserve policymakers
who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher
interest rates to restrain growth and inflation.
   But the market was looking toward Friday's report on November
employment for confirmation of economic growth trends.
   Charles Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp., said today's
decline in prices reflected ``some precautionary selling on the part
of traders who don't want to be caught long if the employment
figures are negative.''
   He said the consensus estimate calls for payroll growth of about
250,000 and said that a number above 275,000 ``would be
disappointing'' because it would increase pressure on the central
bank to encourage higher interest rates.
   Rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields
on fixed-income investments such as Treasury bills relatively more
attractive compared with the riskier returns on stocks.
   In a new report today, the government said its chief forecasting
gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in
October after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in September.

   Fort Howard Corp. has agreed to pay nearly
$15 million to settle two lawsuits filed by shareholders against the
$3.6 billion management buyout of the company, according to
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Plaintiffs in both lawsuits objected to the $53-a-share bid,
saying the company was worth more money.
   Fort Howard management, backed by Morgan Stanley Group Inc., last
summer submitted the only formal bid to purchase Fort Howard, a
papermaking company that posted sales of $1.4 billion during the
first nine months of this year.
   In one settlement, Fort Howard agreed to pay $13.4 million during
a one-year period to shareholders who filed six separate suits later
combined into one action.
   The suits were filed in the Court of Chancery in New Castle
County, Dela.
   In the second case, filed in Federal Court in New York City, Fort
Howard agreed to make one payment of $1.5 million to the securities
firm of Kaufman, Alsberg & Co. Inc., New York City, according to the
documents filed with the SEC by Fort Howard.
   The settlements will not be finalized until the courts hearing
the cases approve them, the SEC statements said.
   Fees and expenses incurred by the plaintiffs attorneys will be
paid out of the settlements, the documents stated.
   A Fort Howard spokesman said he could not comment on whether the
lawsuits could have blocked the management-led takeover from being
completed Oct. 24.

   More than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to
meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to
meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness,
according to the federal government's first consumer guide to
nursing homes, released today.
   The survey also found that more than one-fourth of the nursing
homes do not administer drugs properly.
   However, Dr. William L. Roper, chief of the Health Care Financing
Administration that compiled and released the statistics, cautioned
against reading more into the figures than is warranted.
   ``This is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around
the country,'' Roper told reporters.
   He said the ``met-unmet'' criteria for each of the 32 categories
included in the state-by-state reports contains no measure of
severity and represented a one-time ``snapshot'' of conditions at
the nursing home's most recent unannounced inspection. To some
degree, he said, it relied on the subjective judgment of the
inspector.
   At the same time, Roper defended release of the report against
industry criticism that it would mislead consumers.
   One complaint was, for example, that a nursing home might be
given an ``unmet'' mark on proper administration of medication if
one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine.
   ``If one person was five minutes late, I'm sure they would not
have been dinged in the survey,'' Roper said. ``What we're looking
at, what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time.
   ``We are not in the business of making arbitrary, bureaucratic
judgments. We are trying to evaluate what is really happening to
people in that nursing home.''
   He added:
   ``What we are looking for ... is not nursing home providers that
barely scrape by. We're looking for people who are good providers,
consistently, over time, 365 days a year. And I have to believe that
if that's where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home,
they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial
point.''
   The 75-volume guide shows how each of the 15,000 nursing homes
fared on 32 health, safety and care standards based on periodic
inspections by state agencies. About 2,400 of the 15,000 received
passing marks in all 32 categories.
   The report had been scheduled for release next week, but copies
were distributed earlier to various state and local agencies, as
well as to consumer groups. When the embargo was broken, HCFA issued
the massive guide immediately.
   Roper said all the information had been available at the state
level if people had ``been willing to work hard enough to get it''
but that HCFA felt it was worthwile to compile it in a single report.
   According to the survey, nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to
meet sanitary standards for food. Almost 30 percent failed to meet
standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness and 29
percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors' orders.
   However, the report also said that only a small percentage of the
nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories.
Overall among skilled homes, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in
only 10 categories.
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health
Care Association, which represents more than 9,000 nursing homes,
said the report ``is misleading _ it is going to confuse the
public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard.
   But Elma Holder, executive director of the National Citizens'
Coalition on Nursing Home Reform, said: ``We think the national
statistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''

<TEXT>
   The British upper-classes got a tart reminder the
other day of how far they've fallen on the ladder of national
priorities.
   It came in a speech by Nicholas Ridley, environment secretary in
the Conservative government, and concerned one of the very pillars
of British aristocracy _ the stately home.
   Addressing the Historic Houses Association on Nov. 22, Ridley
delivered a blunt message on these lines: if you can't afford the
upkeep of your stately home, don't ask the government for help; sell
it to the ``nouveaux riches.''
   The speech, which brought ripples of reproach from the landed
gentry, was another sign of how the old Britain has been transformed.
   The Conservative Party, once topheavy with squires and knights of
the shires, today is peopled with the likes of Ridley, a civil
engineer, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a
chemist and a grocer.
   Things have changed drastically since 1938, when Noel Coward
wrote:
   ``The stately homes of England
   How beautiful they stand
   To prove the upper classes
   Still have the upper hand.''
   The post-World War II Labor Party government, intent on fostering
socialist egalitarianism, imposed massive taxation on inherited
wealth, forcing many owners to turn their stately homes over to the
public.
   The homes became museums, while the owners moved into small
corners of the estate. By one estimate, the number of major stately
homes occupied by one family shrank from 10,000 to 2,000.
   Ridley recalled the days when governments, to preserve historic
mansions for the nation, had to pay ``simply to keep roofs on and
walls standing.''
   But after a decade of Thatcherism, he said, ``Things have
changed. Everywhere we see the new prosperity. Millionaires abound
and there are many more budding ones called yuppies.''
   Yet he was still hearing ``cries from some quarters for more,
rather than less state help.'' That, he said, was out.
   ``There have to be some opportunities for today's nouveaux
riches, so I am not impressed by the case of the anciens pauvres,''
he said.
   Nor was he impressed by noble lineages. ``Many families who pride
themselves on having always lived in a house in fact married into
it, bought it or stole it at some point in their murky history, when
they were robber barons, property speculators or simply won the
pools.''
   Ridley's blunt talk drew some testy responses.
   Right-wing commentator Roger Scruton suggested that as the second
son of noble family, Ridley, 59, suffered from the British
affliction of ``younger son syndrome'' _ a resentment born of
primogeniture, whereby the first-born inherits the title and estate,
while the others must fend for themselves.
   In the conservative Daily Telegraph, James Lees-Milne called
Ridley's remarks ``totally unwarranted,'' arguing that stately
families were doing a service to conservation by staying on their
land.
   Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, author of a guide to British country
houses, says the problem is not with the larger homes, which can
easily be turned into money-spinning public attractions, but the
smaller homes, whose owners are hard-pressed to survive.
   ``The families that are still in their homes have a lot of
influence and do a lot of good,'' he said in an interview.
   They feel greater responsibility for their tenant farmers and
hold unpaid public posts like high sheriff and justice of the peace.
``I wonder whether the nouveaux riches, who use these places as
weekend pads to impress their friends, would be willing to take on
these responsibilities,'' he said.
   Also, he said, the attraction of country homes is their valuable
furnishings, historic collections that risk being broken up and sold
off by new owners lacking a sense of heritage.
   Terence Empson, director of the Historic Houses Association where
Ridley spoke, said homeowners had already proved ingenious at
fending for themselves, turning their estates into conference
centers, safari parks and even ``war games parks'' for adventurous
executives.
   Ridley's exhortations might apply to smaller homes within
commuting distance of the cities, he said in an interview. ``But if
you have a historic home on a palatial scale deep in the
countryside, I don't see millionaire yuppies queuing round the block
to buy it. The market just isn't there.''

   His name is not as familiar as chief
executive F. Ross Johnson or buyout specialist Henry Kravis, but as
the key decisionmaker in history's largest corporate takeover,
Charles E. Hugel held the fate of both dealmakers in his hands.
   The 60-year-old Hugel is chairman and chief executive officer of
his own $3 billion company, Combustion Engineering Inc. of Stamford.
But he also serves as non-executive chairman of the board of RJR
Nabisco Inc. and head of RJR's five-member special directors'
committee.
   In the latter role, he was responsible for choosing a winner in
the nation's biggest and wildest corporate bidding war, which
produced an apparent triumph for Kravis and his buyout firm,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. late Wednesday.
   Kravis's much-revised bid of $24.53 billion for RJR Nabisco was
chosen over a competing offer from a Johnson-led management group.
   In the eye of the hurricane whipped up by the bidding stood the
unassuming Hugel, who is described by those who know him as an
innovative businessman who quietly tackles goals that some will only
talk about.
   For instance, he was one of the first American businessmen to
negotiate a major deal with the Soviet Union.
   In June, Combustion Engineering announced it had reached an
agreement to help build and manage a multibillion-dollar
petrochemical complex in two Western Siberian cities. It was the
company's second deal with the Soviet Union in six months.
   Hugel also has previous experience in the merger and acquisition
wars as a director of Primerica Corp., a Greenwich, Conn.-based
financial services giant sold earlier this year to Commercial Credit
Corp. in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $1.65 billion.
   A former executive vice president of American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. and former president of Ohio Bell Telephone Co., Hugel
was regarded as neutral in the Nabisco battle because he is
``non-executive chairman,'' which means he is not an employee of the
company.
   When he took the Nabisco post, he became the only Fortune 500
company chairman also serving as chief executive officer and
chairman of another major firm.
   The role of his special committee was critical to the future of
the Atlanta-based food and tobacco conglomerate. The committee was
criticized by some on Wall Street for adding to the confusion of the
bidding process by extending the deadline for bids to Nov. 29. And
even then, the deadline proved meaningless, since both principal
bidders upped their offers well after the time limit.
   But for Hugel and the committee it was a finely calculated risk.
By extending the bidding, Hugel hoped to maximize the offers for the
company _ and the return to shareholders.
   While deadlines were abused, the extensions may have spared the
company some future litigation from shareholders complaining they
didn't get the best deal possible.
   Still, the one goal that eluded Hugel was orderliness. The
auction was confused and rife with personality clashes to the end.
   And in a final, cruel twist of fate, Hugel and the committee
decided to spurn their own management team, led by Johnson, in favor
of the outside buyout specialists.
   Raised by a single mother during the Depression, Hugel served a
stint in the Army and started at AT&T as a student engineer. He said
teamwork is a key part of his management philosophy.
   ``I worked at AT&T for 30 years and at AT&T, you learn how to
delegate to good people and how to build teamwork,'' he said in a
recent interview.
   A business associate said he is sure Hugel's experience was an
asset at the negotiating table while the RJR deal was being worked
out.
   ``He is a very practical businessman and a hard worker,'' said
Primerica Chairman Gerald Tsai Jr. ``If he has a goal he gets it.
... Charlie was the first in America with this size contract with
the Soviet Union. He was very persistent and he finally got it.''
   Hugel is ``straightforward,'' Tsai said. ``If he says something,
you can bank on it.''
   Several Wall Street analysts declined to talk about Hugel during
the RJR negotiations. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was
critical of Hugel's management of Combustion Engineering.
   ``He's running CE into the ground,'' the analyst said. ``The
costs are out of sight. He's getting his comeuppance.
   ``I think he ought to stay in CE more,'' he said. ``It's tough
enough to run one company well. ... He's spending his time handling
Nabisco.''
   Combustion Engineering _ which builds and services
power-generating systems for utilities, supplies equipment to
chemical and refining industries and operates waste-to-energy plants
_ recently announced a loss of $62.9 million in its revised
nine-month results.
   The company said the results were due to increases in estimated
costs to complete its waste-to-energy plants, cost overruns and
repair costs.
   Despite those problems, some analysts predict improvement in the
company's fortunes next year. Combustion Engineering is in the
process of selling off $285 million in assets and will be able to
use the cash to reduce its debt and interest expenses.
   With low demand for new power plants, Hugel has steered the
company in the direction of maintenance and service, where revenues
are expected to grow.
   Hugel has been upbeat about his business decisions in the past.
In the 1987 annual report, he told Combustion Engineering
shareholders that the company had ``made considerable progress''
toward becoming a ``new and different'' company.
   Hugel is also a member of the boards of directors of Eaton Corp.
and Pitney Bowes Inc. and chairman of the board of trustees of
Lafayette College, his alma mater.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ When $2 billion from the buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc. hits Winston-Salem, the people who sell jewels, cars
and houses for a living hope to be busy.
   Analysts estimate that 9,000 people in Winston-Salem, former
headquarters of the food and tobacco giant, own $1 billion worth of
stock in the company, and that local trusts, foundations and
retirement plans own another $1 billion.
   The estimates are based on a stock price of $100 a share. The
company was auctioned off Wednesday to buyout specialists Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. in a deal worth about $109 a share to
stockholders in cash and securities.
   When local shareholders receive their share of the proceeds, it
could make for a very merry Christmas for area merchants.
   Thomas Winstead, the general manager of Hanes Mall, said that
unlike retailers in other parts of the country, merchants at his
mall have seen strong sales so far in the Christmas shopping season.
Money from the buyout could only make it better.
   ``The merchants of Hanes Mall, as well as other retailers in this
area, are prepared to serve with whatever the stockholders need,''
Winstead said. ``Do I sound reserved enough?''
   Winstead said the people who have seen their stock climb by $37 a
share over the past six weeks might well wish to make
``celebration-type purchases'' of luxury items when their checks
arrive.
   At Windsor Jewelers in downtown Winston-Salem, Lois Simon said
she has already noticed an influx of customers who don't look like
the usual clientele for expensive jewelry.
   ``These are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be
pricing our emeralds and diamonds,'' Mrs. Simon said. She said she
assumes the prospective customers are scouting out purchases they
could make with the proceeds from the sale of their RJR Nabisco
stock.
   The company moved its headquarters to Atlanta last year but
maintains the core of its tobacco operations here.
   Tim A. Cooper, sales manager at a Mercedes dealership, said he
hasn't yet seen any customers who are eager to put down their RJR
profits on a new Mercedes.
   But he added: ``I hope we do see some increase in traffic due to
that.''
   Two local realtors _ Frank Frye and Bruce Hubbard _ said some RJR
investors may put their proceeds into new homes.
   ``What I see happening is what anyone would see if you have a
rich uncle die,'' Frye said. ``I think a lot of people will take
awhile, but they'll eventually look at upgrading their living
standards.''
   But economists at two local universities said the windfall
probably won't spawn a huge spending spree in Winston-Salem.
   Donald Frey, an economics professor at Wake Forest University,
said many investors _ and especially large institutions _ will
probably just reinvest their money.
   ``Most people aren't going to confuse it with income,'' he said.
``They would say, `These are assets that I worked to create, so I'm
not going to go out and blow it on a vacation.'''
   He said employees of subsidiary R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. who are
worried about the future of their jobs will probably be careful
about how they use the money from the sale of their company.
   ``Not all of that spending will take place immediately, and not
all of it will take place in Winston,'' said G. Donald Jud, a
professor of finance at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro.

   Some of the world's best-known food brands may
ultimately be sold and spending on marketing and new product
development may be cut as a result of the $24.5 billion buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc., analysts said Thursday.
   But the analysts said they cannot predict whether retail prices
will go up or consumers will find it harder to locate their favorite
snacks until it becomes clear who winds up with specific products.
   Many analysts expect the apparent winner in the buyout battle, a
group led by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., will
be forced to sell chunks of the company to meet interest payments on
the huge debt that will be incur in making the purchase.
   ``I've got to assume they will sell a lot of the foods
operations,'' said Neal Kaplan, the food and tobacco analyst for the
investment firm Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C.
   He said Kohlberg Kravis probably would keep the tobacco company
because of the strong cash flow it generated and then sell stock to
the public later to raise money.
   Officials of Kohlberg Kravis could not be reached for comment on
their plans for RJR Nabisco. A spokeswoman speaking on condition
that she not be identified said the firm had said repeatedly it
wanted ``to keep the company as intact as possible'' and avoid
``massive selling of all the food operations.''
   But Kaplan and other analysts said the debt costs would make it
all but certain that the new owners would be forced to sell some key
operations, such as Nabisco's cookie and cracker business, its
candy, cereal and snack foods interests or its Del Monte canned
vegetable and tropical fruits divisions.
   David Goldman, the food and tobacco analyst for Fahnestock & Co.,
estimated the new owners could get $8 billion for either the Nabisco
foods business or the Reynolds tobacco business, $4 billion to $7
billion for Del Monte and $800 million to $1.2 billion for the
Planters nuts and Life Savers candy business.
   The list of buyers who analysts cite as potential buyers of parts
of the Nabisco operations include the biggest names in consumer
products _ Procter & Gamble, Ralston-Purina, Quaker Oats, Pepsico
and Borden.
   John Maxwell, food and tobacco analyst for Wheat First Securities
in Richmond, Va., said Procter & Gamble, for instance, might be
keenly interested in Nabisco's ready-to-eat cookie business.
Nabisco's cookie brands include Oreo, Chips Ahoy and Fig Newton and
it also owns Ritz crackers.
   He said Ralston or Quaker might be interested in adding Nabisco's
Shredded Wheat to their line of cereals, while Pepsico and Borden
might want Planters nuts to expand their own snack food operations.
   Whether or not major assets are sold, Goldman said, the new
owners will have to cut corners to meet debt payments.
   ``You could see some modest reductions in advertising and other
marketing tools such as couponing and consumer promotions,'' he said.
   RJR Nabisco was for fifth largest national advertiser in 1987,
spending nearly $840 million in support of both its food and tobacco
businesses last year, according to the trade journal Advertising Age.
   Goldman expects a sharp decline in new product introductions
because ``you just don't have the latitude for loss that you had as
an ongoing company.''
   Martin Friedman, editor of Gorman's New Product News, said less
than 1 percent of the 11,000 new food and drug products this year
will produce the level of national sales that major companies
generally consider a success.
   Gary Stibel, a partner in the marketing firm New England
Consulting Group in Westport, Conn., said the prospects for any
given line of food products rests entirely with the group that
ultimately ends up owning them.
   Companies that buy a product line to expand their existing share
of markets generally spend heavily to promote them and may raise
prices, he said.
   But companies that buy a product line in hopes of selling it
later for a profit may be more apt to cut promotional spending and
try to live off the line's reputation as long as possible, he said.
   The fallout from the RJR Nabisco buyout would no necessarily be
limited to the food operations, Fahnestock's Goldman said.
   He said the buyout could mean an early end to RJR Nabisco's
two-month test of its smokeless cigarette, Premier, which delivers
nicotine like a cigarette without much of the smoke.
   ``The Premier appeared to be a dead product to begin with.
Consumer aceptanmce of the product has been dismal. Health
authorities have been rallying against it,'' Goldman said.
   He said the new owners might decide to spare themselves the legal
costs that might be needed to defend the product against legal
challenges.
   ``Premier will become the Edsel of 1988,'' he predicted,
referring to the automobile that proved a costly failure.

   The stock market drifted mostly lower today in
subdued trading as investors awaited new evidence on the strength of
the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on
Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, was
down 5.34 at 2,109.17 with one hour left in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 4 to 3 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 613 up, 785 down
and 521 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 103.29 million shares at 3 p.m. on
Wall Street compared with 130.18 million shares at the same point in
Wednesday's session.
   The market rallied in the previous session on indications that
the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace.
   That presumably would mean that the Federal Reserve policymakers
who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher
interest rates to restrain growth and inflation.
   But investors were looking toward Friday's report on November
employment for confirmation of economic growth trends.
   Charles Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp., said today's
decline in prices reflected ``some precautionary selling on the part
of traders who don't want to be caught long if the employment
figures are negative.''
   In a new report today, the government said its chief forecasting
gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 0.1 percent in
October after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in September.
   RJR Nabisco was off 1[ at 91~ and was the most active stock on
the NYSE. The company said late Wednesday it had accepted an offer
of $109 a share in cash and securities from buyout specialist
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., spurning a competing offer from a
management group.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was also active. It was down [

fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses related to getting rid of
outdated telephone equipment.
   General Cinema was up 2\ at 24[. It announced it had tentatively

   As this week's deadline for final bids approached,
RJR Nabisco Inc.'s F. Ross Johnson told a reporter for Time
magazine: ``If I fail, I'm on the hook.''
   That worst-case scenario nows faces the once-confident chief
executive, whose management team launched a bidding war six weeks
ago in hopes of taking the nation's 19th largest industrial company
private.
   Johnson's group apparently lost out to buyout specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. on Wednesday after running up the
price tag for the food and tobacco company to more than $24 billion.
   For Johnson, it was a stunning defeat that contrasts sharply to
his quick rise to the top of the food and tobacco conglomerate.
   Also at stake were immense financial rewards _ under his initial
bid, Johnson stood to make $100 million.
   What's worse, a corporate takeover by outsiders can mean
unemployment for a target company's top management, and a Kohlberg
Kravis buyout of RJR Nabisco makes it unlikely Johnson will stay
there for long.
   But the turmoil that generally accompanies takeovers hasn't
stopped the 56-year-old Johnson before on his path from Canada's
prairies to the riches and celebrity that accompany leadership in
the upper echelons of corporate America.
   As the youngest chairman and chief executive officer ever to head
Standard Brands Inc., Johnson made the packaged-goods company an
enticing target for a 1981 takeover by Nabisco Inc.
   He got the top post at the newly-created company three years
later, when Robert Schaerberle, Nabisco's chief executive officer,
took early retirement. Under Johnson's leadership, an increasingly
profitable Nabisco caught the eye of R.J. Reynolds Inc., which
acquired the food company for $4.9 billion in 1985.
   Again, Johnson did not immediately get the top management job.
But RJR's board presented it to him the following year.
   His willingness to take risks with his own job has contributed to
Johnson's reputation as an aggressive executive with an uncanny
intuition and lightning responses.
   ``He operates from the gut and makes some large decisions from
the gut,'' said Stanley Katz, whose FCB-Leber Katz Partners handles
some RJR advertising.
   Johnson had been RJR Nabisco's chief executive just 15 days when
he announced the company was moving its headquarters from
Winston-Salem, N.C., home for over a century to its central tobacco
division, to Atlanta.
   On Day 16, he announced the sale of RJR's Heublein liquor and
wine business for $1.2 billion. Kentucky Fried Chicken, Canada Dry
and more than two dozen other operations also went on the block
later as Johnson focused the company on packaged food and tobacco.
   Early plans to sell the tobacco division were canceled as it
became clear that cigarettes remained a profitable business. And
Johnson's previously announced plans to reorganize the company
internally to boost its stock price were canceled in mid-October
when Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered nearly $12 billion for Kraft
Inc.
   Johnson's leveraged buyout proposal for RJR Nabisco came soon
after, amid a wave of takeovers aimed at food companies such as his.
   ``When an opportunity hits, you got to hit,'' he once told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, punctuating his remark with a boxer's
jab.
   ``Once he decides to make a move, he makes it,'' said longtime
associate Robert J. Carbonell. ``He likes to speak in terms of
quantum leaps in achieving competitive advantages.''
   Johnson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and earned a degree in
commerce at the University of Manitoba while serving as president of
his fraternity and a member of the basketball team.
   He paid his own way to Toronto after graduation to accept a job
with General Electric of Canada. During his 12 years there, he went
to night school to earn a master's degree in business administration.
   After six years with two other companies, working in retail and
as an executive, he joined Standard Brands in 1971.
   Johnson likes to say, ``If you don't take risks, you can't
compete.'' The fruits of his risk-taking show in his Jaguar; his
corporate jet; his homes in Manhattan, Atlanta and Florida; his golf
games with Bob Hope and Gerald Ford; his friendships with Frank
Gifford and Don Meredith. He steers clear of the social scene, but
appears at company-sponsored benefits.
   ``He has a very strong aversion to two things: bureaucracy and
incompetency,'' Carbonell told the Atlanta newspapers. ``He does not
tolerate incompetency. He's demanding, and you better deliver. You
never want to let Ross down.''

   NBC won the U.S. television rights to the 1992
Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, The Associated Press learned
today.
   NBC, which televised the Summer Olympics in Seoul, had been
considered a longshot to get the Barcelona rights. CBS was favored
because it already owns the TV rights to the 1992 Winter Games in
Albertville, France.

   Stock prices drifted lower today in a lackluster
performance restrained by anticipation of Friday's release of
November employment statistics.
   The market had rallied earlier this week on indications that the
economy may be growing at a more moderate pace.
   That presumably would mean that the Federal Reserve policymakers
who meet in mid-December may not feel compelled to encourage higher
interest rates to restrain growth and inflation.
   But analysts said trading slowed today as investors looked toward
Friday's report on November employment for confirmation of economic
growth trends.
   If the report shows stronger-than-expected job growth, some
market watchers expect the Fed may feel obliged to encourage higher
interest rates.
   Rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields
on fixed-income investments such as Treasury bills relatively more
attractive compared with the risks inherent in owning stocks.

   Assets of the nation's 466 money market mutual
funds fell $1.13 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $280.64 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.4 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.40 billion in the week
ended Nov. 23, 1988
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 230general purpose funds rose $268.6 million to $90.25
billion, assets of 100 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.01 billion to
$117.22 billion, and assets of 136 institutional funds declined
$389.1 million to $73.18 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.75 percent from 7.68 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.65 percent from 7.60 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 35
days, down from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.12 percent as of Wednesday from 6.10 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, rose to 5.13 percent from 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.02
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.93 the
previous week. Yields were 8.27 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.21
percent; 8.42 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.39 percent; and 8.62
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.60 percent.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Thursday
it will post the first annual loss in its 103-year history as a
result of a $6.7 billion pre-tax charge that covers the costs of
scrapping outdated equipment and moving, retiring or laying off
16,000 employees.
   Wall Street saw the giant charge as a sign that AT&T was moving
aggressively to cut costs and install a new digital network to meet
the competition. The stock was fairly stable, falling 50 cents to
$29.37{ a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The charge will not affect AT&T's cash flow, its ability to pay
dividends or the money available for investment.
   ``This reflects the adjustment of going from a regulated
marketplace to a competitive marketplace,'' said Robert Morris III,
a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   AT&T said the charge would reduce its after-tax profits by $3.9
billion. That makes it likely that the company will lose about $1.6
billion in all of 1988 and $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter alone.
   The only larger quarterly losses in U.S. history were AT&T's own
$4.87 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1983, which involved a
charge to prepare for the Bell System breakup, and Texaco Inc.'s
$4.76 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 stemming from its
legal fight with Pennzoil Co.
   Long-distance phone companies have been moving aggressively to
replace their old-fashioned analog equipment with new digital
equipment that provides higher quality and is better suited to
custom services and transmission of computer data.
   The bulk of the charge, $5.0 billion, is to reflect on the books
the lower value of outdated analog network equipment. The remaining
$1.7 billion is for the costs of removing the outdated equipment,
writedowns in the value of related equipment, and reductions in
employment.
   AT&T said it would reduce the number of its network employees by
10,000 and the number of its operators by 6,000 over the next few
years.
   AT&T does not yet know how many of the employees will be given
jobs elsewhere in the company because that depends on the company's
growth, spokeswoman LuAnn Gardner said.
   The Communications Workers of America, the union representing
135,000 AT&T workers, issued a statement saying non-management
employees have suffered the loss of 78,500 jobs since 1984 while
management ranks have risen by 13,600.
   ``This company just has not bitten the bullet _ it has not come
out of its `monopoly cocoon' levels of management,'' the union said.
   AT&T spokesman Burke Stinson responded that the company had to
hire white-collar workers because of its new thrusts into computers
and foreign markets. But he said ``we're not blind to the fact''
that staff jobs need to be cut.
   AT&T has a freeze on hiring over most of the company. That gives
the displaced employees a better chance to find work elsewhere
within the company than if they had to face competition from new
hires.
   Plans to reduce 3,000 of the network jobs and all 6,000 of the
operator service jobs had already been announced to employees, AT&T
said. The company is setting aside $400 million to cover the cost of
redeploying them or giving them payments or incentives related to
separation from the company by retirement or resignation.
   The job cuts are possible because improvements in the network
reduce the need for maintenance, engineering, service, order
processing and call handling. Operators at new stations are able to
handle 25 percent more calls per hour, the company said.
   AT&T has switched over to a digital network far more rapidly than
it had previously planned.
   The company predicted early in 1987 that it would take until the
year 2010 to have an all-digital network. By the end of 1987 it said
it could do the job by 1991. On Thursday, it said it could do the
job by the end of next year.
   MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., the
No. 2 and No. 3 competitors in long distance, have also moved
rapidly to put in digital networks and have taken big charges to
write down the book value of their outdated analog equipment.
   Executives of AT&T had said in October that writedowns in the
fourth quarter could be substantial. By taking the pain of the
writedown all at once, AT&T no longer has to lower its quarterly
profits to reflect the costs of depreciating the older equipment.
   ``We view this as very positive news,'' Ms. Gardner said. ``Our
network will continue to be the best out there.''
   AT&T took a $10 billion pre-tax charge at the end of 1983 to
prepare for the divestiture of its local telephone companies. It
also took pre-tax charges of $200 million in 1985 and $3.2 billion
at the end of 1986.
   AT&T has reduced employment by 64,000 since the breakup of the
Bell System on Jan. 1, 1984. It has about 310,000 employees now, and
that could drop to below 300,000 over the next three to five years,
Ms. Gardner said.
   As large as the job cuts are, securities analysts said they could
be even larger.
   ``They have grossly too many people. At the time of divestiture,
a lot of people were unloaded onto them,'' said James McCabe, an
analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc. He said the cuts
have occurred gradually because ``they're a very humane employer.''
   The Communications Workers of America said AT&T had originally
indicated it had a surplus of 12,000 to 14,000 operators, and that
the union bargained the company down to 6,000.
   Stinson said the thrust of the statement was correct but AT&T
could not confirm the union's numbers.

<TEXT>
   When the managers of RJR Nabisco Inc. aligned
themselves with a competing investment house and put the company in
play, it didn't take long to flush out Henry Kravis, the master of
Wall Street's buyout game.
   Six weeks after jumping into the fray to protect his
``franchise'' on leveraged buyouts, King Henry is still on top.
   At 44, Kravis is the highest profile member of the partnership of
Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts Co., which is credited with making the
leveraged buyout technique a powerful factor in the biggest takeover
binge in American history.
   The partnership's apparent victory in the unprecedented auction
for RJR Nabisco _ with a bid exceeding $24.5 billion _ joins other
crown jewels in Kohlberg Kravis's expanding showcase of corporate
acquisitions.
   Before the food and tobacco gem came Beatrice Cos., for 6.1
billion in 1986; Safeway Stores Inc., for $4.2 billion the same
year; Storer Communications Inc. for $2.5 billion in 1985; and Stop
& Shop Cos., for $1.2 billion in 1988, among others.
   Kohlberg Kravis is the undisputed leader in LBOs, in which it and
other investors put up a small amount of money and borrows the rest,
repaying the debt with the acquired company's earnings, the sale of
assets or both.
   In the past 10 years, Kravis has spent more than $38 billion
acquiring about 35 companies. Investors in the firm's growing LBO
investment fund have earned about 40 percent returns in the process,
and Kohlberg Kravis has become manager of a huge conglomerate.
   The man at the top of the heap of all that debt _ and power _ is
Kravis, an Oklahoma boy who has found a home on Wall Street and the
social circles of Manhattan.
   Married to a glamorous fashion designer, Carolyne Roehm, Kravis
lives a life straight out of Tom Wolfe's novel ``The Bonfire of the
Vanities.'' While he works incessantly, he finds time to dash out to
key dates on the party circuit and entertain guests at his
Connecticut estate, where _ rumor has it _ the smell of fresh-baked
croissants is piped into the guestrooms every morning.
   ``It's a high-voltage existence,'' his wife said in an interview
with Newsweek magazine earlier this year.
   At work, Kravis was the protege of Jerome Kohlberg, who left the
fold last year after a falling out with Kravis and George Roberts,
the other major partner. The principal point of disagreement between
Kohlberg and his partners was the size of deals the firm should
pursue.
   Kravis and Roberts stand ready to scale ever more challenging
heights. Although the RJR Nabisco buyout carries more than $20
billion in debt, Kravis believes the deal is still conservative.
   The amount of equity in the acquired company is estimated at
about $7.4 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In terms
of leveraged buyouts, that is considered low, Kravis said Thursday.
   The deal was an even more critical measure of Kravis's personal
and professional prestige _ which is why he entered the bidding in
such a brazen way in the first place.
   After RJR Nabisco chief executive F. Ross Johnson first announced
his plan to take the company private Oct. 20, Kravis rushed to make
his own proposal. Initially, he tried to call off Johnson's
financial advisers, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., in a meeting in
which Kravis offered to top Johnson's bid to ``protect his
franchise.''
   Kravis's overtures were greeted with a flat rejection from the
management group and the bidding war was on.
   If Kravis succeeds in adding RJR Nabisco's tobacco and food
holdings to his stable, the LBO kingdom will boast revenues of $50
billion or more _ about the same as blue-chip International Business
Machines Corp.
   ``There's a sense of one-upmanship in the financial markets,''
said one stock analyst early on in the battle for RJR Nabisco.
``These people want to say, `We've done the biggest deal ... We're
the best.'''
   For the moment, King Henry is just that.

   The dollar's value was little changed Thursday in

indicating sluggish economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said the Index of Leading Indicators
edged up a slight 0.1 percent in October. Analysts said the number
was within expectations.
   Also Thursday, the nation's largest general retailers said sales
continued at their now-familiar sluggish pace in November.
   Traders said the market was waiting for Friday's scheduled
release of U.S. unemployment figures for November. Market forecasts
anticipate the unemployment rate has stabilized at 5.3 percent.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Slide on Absence of Soviet Wheat Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting disappointment that the new grain deal with the
Soviet Union had not yet produced a wheat transaction, analysts said.
   Other grain futures closed mostly lower and soybeans posted
substantial losses on fears of a wet weekend in the South American
soybean belt.
   On other markets, sugar futures rose sharply; precious metals
declined; energy futures rallied; livestock and meat futures were
higher; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Many wheat traders had expected the Agriculture Department to
offer the Soviet Union a large amount of subsidized U.S. wheat under
the Export Enhancement Program within days of Monday's signing of a
27-month grain agreement.
   The absence of such an offer spawned speculation Thursday that
the superpowers were still haggling over price and that any
purchases would not be immediately forthcoming, said Dale Gustafson,
a grain market analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The trade is beginning to believe that we may not see the wheat
business coming in December, and maybe not until well after that,''
he said.
   The new grain agreement calls for the Soviets to purchase 4
million metric tons of wheat, 4 million tons of corn and 1 million
tons of their choice in both the current year, which began Oct. 1,
and the following year.
   Conflicting forecasts for the weekend weather in Brazil and
Argentina, where soybean planting is under way, prompted a sell-off
in the soybean pit, analysts said.
   If the dry weather that has marked the early part of the planting
period persists into the growing season, South American forecasts
could lend a fair amount of volatility to the U.S. futures market,
Gustafson said.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 10\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.16 a bushel; corn was 4 cents lower to }
cent higher with December at $2.57\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to
5 cents lower with December at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 5{
cents to 8{ cents lower with January at $7.58 a bushel.
   Sugar futures made strong gains on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange in a rally linked to bullish technical signals and
indications that world production may fall short of consumption this
year, leading to a reduction in stockpiles.
   At this point, though, ``there appears to be plenty of physical
sugar available, so it seems to be just a speculative rally,'' said
Erik Dunlaevy, sugar market analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in
New York.
   Sugar settled .31 cent to .49 cent higher with the active March
contract at 11.44 cents a pound, the highest price for March
delivery since July 25.
   Platinum prices dipped amid profit-taking on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following Wednesday's stunning advance of nearly
$25 a troy ounce.
   A strengthening of the dollar also contributed to lower
precious-metals prices, as did jitters prior to Friday's release of
November unemployment figures.
   ``That always makes traders uneasy,'' said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Platinum settled $7.80 to $13.80 lower with January at $600.90 a
troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 90 cents to $1.10
lower with December at $423.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to
5.1 cents lower with December at $6.096 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
technically-inspired trading in the absence of new supply-demand
developments, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10 cents to 29 cents higher
with January at $15.61 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent to .94
cent higher with January at 49.18 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .25 cent lower to .83 cent higher with January at 45.98 cents a
gallon.
   Cattle futures firmed in a rebound from three consecutive days of
lower prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``People know the long-term outlook is bullish,'' said Charles
Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.
   Expectations for a mid-December slowdown in hog slaughters
boosted pork futures, he said.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent to .35 cent higher with December at
72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .73 cent higher
with January at 83.15 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent to .55 cent
higher with December at 40.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent to .55 cent higher with February at 45.07 cents a
pound.
   Stock-index futures finished slightly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 settled .15 point higher at 273.20. Each point
is worth $500.

   Share prices dropped Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange in an edgy session, as players grew nervous about forecasts
of difficult conditions in the British retailing industry.
   The FT-SE 100-share index finished down 13.7 points, or 0.76
percent, at 1,778.7, above its late-afternoon low of 1,771.7.
   Volume was a sparse 343.4 million shares, down sharply from 444.8
million traded Wednesday.
   British fashion retailer Next said recent rises in domestic
interest rates and other economic factors would produce a
``significant'' drop in the company's profit for fiscal 1988.
   The statement sent shares of retailers plunging as analysts'
concerns about difficulties in the retailing industry spilled over
to the broader market.
   Nervousness over the prospects for the planned British Steel
privatization, as well as the general economic outlook, also
provided a gloomy backdrop to the market.
   Traders said a wobbly start on Wall Street added to the mounting
pessimism in the London market.
   The Financial Times index of 30 industrials closed at 1,450.2,
down 7.8.
   The Financial Times 500-share index finished at 1,004.68, down
8.7.

   Stock prices drifted lower Thursday in a sluggish
session marked by worries that interest rates may be headed higher.
   Analysts said many investors appeared to prefer standing aside in
advance of the November employment report due Friday which could
provide some indication of whether the economy is moderating or
overheating.
   ``Right now everybody is sitting back waiting for the employment
figures,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst for the brokerage A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``Nobody has any conviction one
way or the other.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 12.98 points on
Wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, lost
12.63 to close at 2,101.88.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8-to-7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
680 issues up, 805 down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 129.38 million shares,
down from 157.81 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
155.12 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were worried that employment growth in
November would indicate faster-than-expected expansion in the
economy.
   If the economy were found to be expanding too quickly, many
analysts fear that the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to push
interest rates higher to slow it down and restrain inflation.
   Higher rates make short-term fixed-income investments more
competitive with the uncertain returns on stocks. Three-month
Treasury bills, for instance, are yielding about 8.10 percent.
   Goldman said most economists expect payroll growth of between
225,000 and 250,000 in November.
   A number significantly higher than that, he said, ``would mean
the economy is in fact overheating and the Fed is going to have to
step on the monetary brakes more heavily than they have already.''
   But there is considerable uncertainty about how fast the economy
is expanding.
   Stocks rallied earlier this week on indications that the economy
may be growing at a more moderate pace.
   In a new report Thursday, the government said its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish
0.1 percent in October after falling by a revised 0.3 percent in
September.
   RJR Nabisco fell 1\ to 91} and was the most active stock on the
NYSE. The company said late Wednesday it had accepted an offer of
$109 a share in cash and securities from buyout specialist Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., spurning a competing offer from a management
group.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was also active. It fell { to
29] after saying it will take a $6.7 billion charge against its
fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses related to getting rid of
outdated telephone equipment.
   General Cinema climbed 2 to 23~ after announcing its planned to
sell its soft drink bottling business to Pepsico Inc. for $1.5
billion. Pepsico fell 2 to 38~.
   Stocks of some of the major retailing companies slipped after
they reported November sales that analysts called sluggish. Sears
Roebuck lost ] to 39{ and J.C. Penney fell { to 52~ but K mart rose
[ to 35}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $5.91 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.53 to 153.37.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index lost 1.34 to 313.78, and S&P's
500-stock composite index fell 1.21 to 272.49.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.89

   NBC stunned CBS with a record bid of $401 million
Thursday to win the U.S. television rights to the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
   NBC, which televised the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea,
had been considered a longshot to get the Barcelona rights. CBS was
favored because it already owns the TV rights to the 1992 Winter
Games in Albertville, France.
   The Barcelona fee topped the previous Olympic record of $309
million paid by ABC for the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. NBC
paid $300 million for the TV rights in Seoul.
   ``We didn't go into this to lose money,'' NBC President Robert
Wright said at a news conference. ``Our plan was designed to
minimize losses. It's not designed to make a lot of money.''
   Wright also said that as part of the agreement, NBC agreed to
spend $10 million to promote the city of Barcelona.
   Michael Weisman, executive producer of NBC Sports, said he was a
``little bit surprised'' that the network got the Barcelona rights.
   ``The first call after I found out was to Terry Ewert, our
coordinating producer (in Seoul),'' Weisman said. ``I said, `I sure
hope you saved all your notes because I threw mine out.'''
   Bryant Gumbel, who anchored NBC's prime-time telecasts in Seoul,
said: ``I think it's terrific news, especially for the guys who
worked in Seoul. I'm a little surprised, though. I naturally assumed
that CBS had the inside track.''
   Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports, said the record fee
indicated his network might have gotten a bargain when it won the
Albertville rights for $243 million.
   ``Certainly the magnitude of NBC's bid for Barcelona reaffirms
the marketplace value of Albertville,'' he said.
   Dennis Swanson, president of oABC Sports, said, ``We are
disappointed, but we congratulate NBC on the acquisition.''
   It was not immediately known how much CBS and ABC bid, but a
source said NBC's offer was ``substantially higher.'' Olympic
officials were seeking a minimum of $350 million.
   ABC lost an estimated $75 million in Calgary. NBC said it made a
``modest'' profit in Seoul, although it was much lower than expected
due to disappointing ratings that forced the network to give
sponsors free advertising.
   NBC is expected to recoup some of its Barcelona fee by selling
about 75 hours of Olympic programming to a cable network for between
$50 million and $75 million.
   Arthur Watson, the president of NBC Sports, said the network had
``a detailed cable plan,'' but would not elaborate. He also said
events probably would not be shown on cable at the same time NBC was
broadcasting.
   Unlike Seoul, prime-time coverage from Barcelona will be taped
because of the six-hour time difference with New York. But that
drawback may be offset by the earlier starting date of the 1992
Games, which will not have to compete with football and the final
weeks of baseball's pennant races.
   The Seoul Olympics started Sept. 17, while the Barcelona Games
are to begin July 25.
   ``Every Olympics has its own feel and I think Barcelona will have
a totally different look than Seoul,'' Weisman said. ``I think we're
in a very good position having done the Seoul Olympics. We were very
proud of what we did in Seoul, but I would be less than honest if I
said I didn't expect to do this one better.''

<HEAD>Mexico Offers Export Reduction to Firm Up OPEC Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An OPEC team plans to visit Mexico and other
non-OPEC producing nations to discuss mutual reductions in export
quotas, according to a published report Thursday.
   The report followed an offer by Mexico's Energy Department to
negotiate a reduction in Mexico's oil exports in a bid to put some
teeth into the OPEC cartel agreement to restrict production.
   Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart this week repeated an offer,
previously spurned by the 13-member cartel, to reduce Mexico's 1.35
million-barrel daily export platform, provided OPEC members enact
similar reductions.
   Reductions also would be sought from other independent producers,
Hiriart said.
   He said department officials planned informal talks with OPEC and
independent producers on possible quota reductions.
   The Energy Department announced that an OPEC committee plans to
visit Mexico and other independent producers to negotiate reductions
to buttress Monday's OPEC pact, the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada
reported Thursday.
   Department officials could not be reached for comment Thursday, a
national holiday called to mark the inauguration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries calls for a cartel export ceiling of 18.5 million barrels
daily, roughly 4 million barrels below current production.
   A statement issued this week by former President Miguel de la
Madrid praised the agreement and urged immediate consultations
between cartel and independent producers. But he warned much
remained to be done to shore up the weak global market.
   ``Mexico urges all producers _ whether or not they are members of
OPEC _ to act with caution in the next few months,'' the statement
said.
   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, has closely
followed the cartel's pricing and production guidelines.
   Only two weeks ago, Hiriart announced Mexico was abandoning that
policy, because overproduction by OPEC members had rendered its

<HEAD>Walt Disney Co. Forming Third Movie Production Arm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to capitalize on a string of
box office successes, Walt Disney Co. on Thursday announced
formation of a third movie production arm called Hollywood Pictures.
   Disney, presently the nation's top producer of movies through its
Touchstone Films and Disney Films divisions, said the new company
would start up Feb. 1. Within three years, it is to be making 12
movies a year, the company said.
   Hollywood Pictures will make movies similar to those from
Touchstone, which produces mainline fare considerably racier than
Disney's traditional animated features and kids' comedies. Budgets
will be similar to those at Touchstone, which is known in the
business for holding the line on production costs and stars'
salaries.
   All Disney films are distributed through a unit called Buena
Vista, which, according to a ranking by the Hollywood trade paper
Daily Variety, has the biggest share of the nation's box office this
year.
   Up to Nov. 13, Buena Vista movies grabbed 20.5 percent of
domestic movie ticket sales, according to Variety. Disney is
followed on that list by Paramount Studios at 14.1 percent, 20th
Century Fox at 12.3 percent, Warner Bros. at 10.7 percent and MGM-UA
Communications at 9.8 percent.
   Touchstone, formed in 1984, surprised many moviegoers by
departing from the Disney tradition of family-oriented
entertainment, producing some films that earned R ratings.
Touchstone reaped a box office bonanza last year with ``Good
Morning: Vietnam,'' and ``Three Men and a Baby.''
   Touchstone has had three recent non-starters: ``Heartbreak
Hotel,'' ``The Good Mother'' and ``Ernest Saves Christmas.''

<HEAD>Maxwell Agrees To Sell Four Units to KKR for $400 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. said Thursday it will
sell four subsidiaries, including three acquired in its recent
purchase of Macmillan Inc., for $400 million to the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Maxwell Communication, a British company headed by Robert
Maxwell, said in a statement it expected to complete the deal before
the end of the year.
   Proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to reduce the debt
Maxwell assumed in its recent $2.5 billion purchase of Macmillan, a
publishing and information services giant.
   Two of the companies being sold are involved principally in
direct mail operations, Macmillan Book Clubs Inc. and Gryphon
Editions Inc. The other two, Intertec Publishing Corp. and Webb
Publishing Co., publish specialty trade and agricultural magazines.
   All but Webb were obtained in the Macmillan deal.
   William Reilly, president of Macmillan, declined to disclose how
much revenue or earnings the four units produced last year.
   Kohlberg Kravis is an aggressive buyout specialist that had
teamed up with Macmillan management in making a bid for Macmillan
but lost after a marathom struggle to Maxwell.
   Reilly said the sale of the four businesses had nothing to do
with the efforts the Kohlberg Kravis group made to acquire Macmillan.
   On Wednesday, Kohlberg Kravis was declared the apparent winner
with a record bid of $24.5 billion for RJR Nabsico Inc., the food
and tobacco giant.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 21, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,058.0 billion in the week ended Nov. 21, from $3,044.7
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,895.1 billion from $3,881.8 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted average of $785.1 billion from $779.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $614 million in
the week ended Nov. 23 to $55.546 billion, compared with a gain of
$160 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $1.104 billion a day
in the week ended Wednesday, up from $294 million in the previous
week.
   That was the highest level since the week ended Sept. 21 when
borrowings averaged $1.24 billion a day.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $286.1 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$285.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Standard & Poor's Places Four Insurance Companies on Creditwatch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard & Poor's Corp. said Thursday it was
re-evaluating its credit ratings of four insurance companies
following the passage of California's Proposition 103.
   Standard & Poor's said it was placing Allstate Insurance Co.,
Farmers Group Inc., Fireman's Fund and Safeco Insurance Co. on its
``Creditwatch'' list with negative implications. That means Standard
& Poor's might downgrade the ratings of the four insurers.
   The firm lowers credit ratings, which are a factor in determining
how much a company must pay to borrow money in the bond markets,
when it determines the company's ability to raise the money for
repaying its debt has been affected.
   Proposition 103, which California voters approved Nov. 8,
requires that rates for motor vehicle, homeowner and other property
and casualty insurance be rolled back to November 1987 levels and
then reduced 20 percent and frozen until November 1989.
   Insurers can request exemptions, but they are to be granted only
if the companies show a ``substantial threat of insolvency'' would
result from the rate cuts.
   Among the measure's other provisions is a requirement that,
beginning in November 1989, the state insurance commissioner approve
all rate increases. Any increases that are ``excessive, inadequate
or unfairly discriminatory'' will be prohibited.
   A number of insurance companies have filed suit in the California
Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of Proposition 103,
and many insurers have restricted or eliminated their California
coverage.
   The Supreme Court has blocked enforcement of the 20 percent rate
reduction and other provisions while the suit is under consideration.

   Reuters Holdings PLC said Thursday it plans to
discontinue manufacturing operations at its IDR Inc. subsidiary on
Long Island next year, and would take an extraordinary charge of $10
million to $15 million this year.
   The subsidiary has been building subscriber terminals for
Reuters, a provider of news and financial information, since 1974.
   Reuters managing director and chief executive, Glen Renfrew, said
the company felt its future lay with personal computers, and expects
to be able to buy such computers on the open market by the end of
1989 at a more favorable price than from its own subsidiary.
   Despite the charge, Renfrew said Reuters expects to report
revenue and profit growth for all of 1988. The company reported net
income of 108.8 million British pounds in 1987 on revenue of 886.9
million pounds.
   Reuters supplies a range of services to business subscribers and

   Eli Lilly and Co. announced Thursday an

   DVI, a privately-owned company based in Redwood City, Calif.,
manufactures catheter systems that treat cardiovascular disease by

   DVI will join Lilly's Medical Instrument Systems Division as a
wholly-owned subsidiary. The division already markets internal and
external pacemakers, catheters for balloon angioplasty, implantable
and external defibrillators and systems for fluid and drug delivery.
   The agreement is subject to approval by DVI shareholders. Owners
of about 65 percent of DVI's common stock have agreed to vote in
favor of the merger, according to the Lilly announcement.
   A special meeting of DVI shareholders will be held early next

<HEAD>Pepsi Unit Pleads Guilty to Price-Fixing, Fined $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Knoxville soft drink bottler was fined
$1 million Thursday after pleading guilty to price-fixing in a dozen
east Tennessee counties in 1983.
   Robert J. Habig, vice president of Atlantic Soft Drink Co. Inc.,
entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Knoxville on
behalf of the company's board of directors. The $1 million fine, the
maximum, was part of the plea agreement between the company and
prosecutors.
   The company also agreed to cooperate with a continuing
investigation of price-fixing in the soft drink industry, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmie Baxter, who represented the
government.
   Because the investigation is still underway, Baxter said, he
could not comment further on the circumstances of the price-fixing.
   PepsiCo, the giant soft-drink company, bought Atlantic Soft Drink
in June, said corporate spokesman Jim Griffith in New York.
   ``All these incidents occurred when the company was owned by
another company,'' Griffith said, although he said he could not
disclose the identity of the former owners. ``All the individuals
involved in the price-fixing have since left the company, had in
fact already left when we assumed ownership.''
   He said PepsiCo was aware of the price-fixing investigation when
it bought Atlantic Soft Drink.
   Atlantic, based in Columbia, S.C., bottles Pepsi and Seven-Up
products. It employs 1,200 people in five states.
   The charge against Atlantic alleges that the company and others
``engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by
fixing discount prices of soft drink products sold in six-pack,
12-ounce cans'' in the following Tennessee counties: Loudon,
Campbell, Anderson, Knox, Sevier, Blount, Union, Claiborne,
Grainger, Jefferson, Hamblen and Cocke.
   The government charged the company with violating the Sherman
Antitrust Act.
   In exchange for the guilty plea, $1 million fine and continued
cooperation, the government agreed not to bring further criminal
charges against the company or any of its subsidiaries for actions
taken prior to the agreement.

   Buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
has claimed victory in a free-for-all record takeover war for RJR
Nabisco Inc. with a $24.53 billion offer for the tobacco and food
giant.
   The $109-a-share offer accepted late Wednesday by RJR's board of
directors shattered a rival effort by an RJR management group and
came in a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left the
unprecedented auction for the company in utter confusion.
   Kohlberg's offer of $81 in cash, $18 in stock and additional
securities worth $10 beat out a last-minute offer valued at $112, or
$25.2 billion, by the management group that instigated the takeover
struggle last month at a price that was $8.3 billion cheaper.

   Here are key events in the takeover struggle for RJR Nabisco Inc.:
   _Oct. 20, 1988: RJR Nabisco announces that top managers led by
chief executive F. Ross Johnson propose to buy the company for $75 a
share in cash and securities or nearly $17 billion, using mostly
borrowed money to be repaid with the company's earnings, assets or
both, a transaction known as a leveraged buyout. The takeover would
dwarf the previous record $13.4 billion paid for Gulf Corp. by
Chevron Corp. in 1984. It also would come less than four years after
tobacco maker R.J. Reynolds bought Nabisco Brands for nearly $5
billion.
   _Oct. 24: Investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the
leader in leveraged buyouts, offers $20.25 billion or $90 a share in
cash and securities for RJR.
   _Oct. 27: Salomon Brothers Inc. joins Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
as the main backers of Johnson's group. At the same time, Kohlberg
Kravis takes its bid directly to RJR shareholders with a tender
offer for their stock.
   _Nov. 2: Informal talks between the two competing bidders to
undertake a joint takeover collapse, partly because of disputes on
fees to be paid to the investment bankers.
   _Nov. 4: Johnson's group raises its bid to $92 a share or $20.7
billion. Forstmann Little & Co., a buyout specialist that competes
with Kohlberg Kravis, suggests it is interested in possibly bidding
for the company as well.
   _Nov. 7: RJR's committee of outside directors announces it will
entertain bids for the company while pursuing other options,
including a debt-financed restructuring.
   _Nov. 16: ITT Corp.'s insurance subsidiaries, large holders of
RJR corporate bonds, sue RJR and Johnson, claiming the leveraged
buyout contemplated by management hurt the value of those bonds.
   _Nov. 17: Forstmann Little says it won't bid for RJR.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., another big RJR bondholder, files
the second major lawsuit against Johnson and RJR.
   _Nov. 18: The first deadline for submitting bids to the special
RJR committee passes, and proposals are received from Johnson's
group, Kohlberg Kravis and a late contender, First Boston Corp.
   _Nov. 20: RJR special committee extends the auction until Nov.
29, saying the offers received were inadequate. It said Johnson
offered $100 a share or $22.7 billion; Kohlberg Kravis offered $94 a
share or $21.3 billion; and First Boston offerd a vague plan it
valued as high as $118 a share or $26.8 billion.
   _Nov. 28 _ In an interview published in Time magazine, his first
public statement since the the takeover fight began, Johnson denies
he undertook the leveraged buyout for personal enrichment, although
he could make $100 million.
   _Nov. 29 _ The second deadline for bids expires and all three
bidders submit new offers worth at least $100 a share each. Late
that night, the company announces a definitive merger agreement with
Kohlberg Kravis at $109 a share, or $24.53 billion.
