   A woman who force-fed her 4-year-old daughter a
fatal dose of salt as punishment was convicted of second-degree
murder Tuesday, but a charge against the father was dismissed.
   ``This child died of salt poisoning,'' Commonwealth's Attorney
Skip Burkart said. ``We're talking about a massive amount of salt
this child was forced to eat.''
   Roanoke County Circuit Judge Kenneth Trabue found Beth Michelle
Riggs, 36, guilty in the May 17 death of her daughter, Heather,
after accepting a plea agreement. Mrs. Riggs had agreed to plead no
contest to the murder charge and guilty to involuntary manslaughter
with the understanding she would be convicted on only one of the
charges.
   The judge found her guilty of the murder charge but threw out
charges of murder and willful child neglect against the father, Jack
Francis Riggs, 39, after finding there was no evidence he
participated in the fatal punishment.
   Mrs. Riggs, who wept at times throughout the day-long hearing,
embraced her husband briefly before deputies led her to jail.
   Trabue set sentencing for February. She faces up to 20 years in
prison.
   The prosecutor said the couple routinely kept Heather, a
Colombian child they had adopted, locked in her room while they were
gone during the day to keep her from eating sweets.
   On May 16, one of the girl's four brothers told his mother that
Heather had eaten sugar, Burkart said. Mrs. Riggs took the bowl,
dumped salt in it and force-fed her daughter up to 20 spoonfuls of
salt as punishment, he said.
   After the girl began vomiting, Mrs. Riggs ordered her to clean up
the mess, the prosecutor said.
   The girl was taken to a hospital in a coma and died the next day.
Burkhart said Mrs. Riggs failed to tell doctors how much salt the
girl had ingested, and doctors testified they did not treat the case
as a poisoning.
   Defense attorney James Swanson argued for an involuntary
manslaughter conviction, which would have carried up to 10 years in
prison, by saying Mrs. Riggs never intended to harm her daughter.
   ``We're dealing with table salt,'' he said. ``We're dealing with
a substance available on every table in this country. She had no
idea of the lethal effect.''
   The prosecutor said Riggs probably will regain custody of the
couple's four sons, who have been living with their grandparents.
Authorities got their initial clues about the salt-poisoning from
statements the boys made to their schoolteachers.

   Two boys, ages 10 and 13, were free on $200 bail
Tuesday after they were accused of operating a sidewalk drugstore
peddling crack, authorities said.
   The youngsters, whose names were withheld because of their ages,
were charged in Dorchester District Court with juvenile delinquency.
   Their parents bailed them out Monday after the boys appeared
before Judge James Dolan, said David Rodman, a spokesman for the
Suffolk County district attorney.
   The youths were arrested Friday night when a police surveillance
team allegedly caught them on a street selling vials of crack to
customers in cars. Police seized 27 vials of the cocaine-baking soda
mix and $56 in cash from the younger boy, who turns 11 on Sunday.
   The youngsters told police they were forced to sell drugs by an
older man, said Boston police spokesman James Jordan. The
neighborhood is the site of frequent drug arrests, he said.
   Officer Dan Linskey said the pair were tough street kids. But he
said the younger one broke down after he was placed in a darkened
cell.
   ``He was afraid of the dark,'' Linskey said. ``He wasn't afraid
of hanging out on the corner. He was afraid of the dark. The kid's
crying because he needed a night light.''
   Rodman said if the youngsters are found guilty, they could be
sent to a Department of Youth Services facility.

<HEAD>Cafritz Will Asks That Home Be Used For Secretary of State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Gwendolyn Cafritz, philanthropist and
famed Washington party-giver, reportedly has asked in her will that
her landmark home become the secretary of state's official residence.
   The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions that the
request was confirmed by former Secretary of State William Rogers,
an executor of Mrs. Cafritz's will, and by Martin Atlas, executive
vice president of the Morris and Gwendolyn D. Cafritz Foundation.
   Mrs. Cafritz died Nov. 29 at age 78, and her husband died in 1964.
   A December 1987 appropriations bill for the State Department
prohibits the federal agency from acquiring an official residence
for the secretary of state.
   However, Secretary of State George Shultz has said repeatedly
that an official residence should be established for the secretary
of state because of the security requirements for protecting the
secretary as well as foreign guests.
   Shultz has said the government could save money by establishing
an official secretary's house because the department has estimated
it costs $500,000 to make each private house secure for the
secretary.
   The Post reported that Mrs. Cafritz left her 14,608-square-foot
1938 Art Moderne house and its property to the Cafritz Foundation,
which is charged with carrying out her wishes.
   Rogers was quoted as saying that if the house cannot be used for
the secretary of state, Mrs. Cafritz had suggested it could be used
as an annex to Blair House for visiting heads of state or for art
scholars.
   Mrs. Cafritz was known for decades as one of Washington's premier
party-givers, hosting lavish gatherings for guests ranging from the
Duke and Duchess of Windsor to Supreme Court justices.

<HEAD>Singer To Spend Night in Jail As Trial Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused to spare James Brown from jail
and denied a change of venue request from his lawyer as the soul
singer's trial on assault charges began Tuesday.
   ``There will be no change of venue. Not one solitary soul said
they could not give the defendant a fair trial,'' Circuit Judge
Hubert E. Long said after the jury was selected.
   Brown's attorney, Bill Weeks, had argued that heavy media
coverage of the case would make it difficult for his client to
receive a fair trial, but the judge refused his request after
questioning the 12 jurors.
   The 60-year-old singer was arrested Sept. 24 after a chase
through Augusta, Ga., and North Augusta, S.C. He is charged with
attempting to run over two North Augusta public safety officers and
failing to stop for a blue light and siren.
   The half-hour chase ended after police shot out the tires on
Brown's pickup truck. It was one of several scrapes with the law the
singer has had in the past year.
   Brown asked Long that he be allowed to go home Tuesday, but the
judge said state law requires him to be jailed during the course of
the trial.
   ``I volunteered to go to Vietnam to sing,'' Brown said. ``I was
not armed. I ask that you trust me, let me go home and come back.''
   But the judge cited a law requiring a defendant's bond to be
revoked during a trial, adding, ``It's nothing personal, but I have
a job to do.''
   Brown's wife, Adrienne, who has twice claimed earlier this year
that her husband beat her, sat in the audience through the day.

   Italy's hottest anchorwoman hikes her skirt on the
evening news, gets sozzled on champagne from male admirers and,
before signing off, invites men to call her on a special line.
   It happens in a television spoof of television, written and
directed by women, but real life is getting closer. One of the women
news readers now on state television has become the subject of
magazine articles and, according to a survey, highly popular among
male viewers.
   ``When you feel secure, you can poke fun at yourself,'' said
Serena Dandini, one of three authors of the new weekly show, ``TiVu
Delle Ragazze'' (The Girls' Television).
   An increasing number of prime time newscasts feature women, and
Italian women are becoming prominent in many other fields once
closed to them.
   Women drive Rome's orange-colored buses in bumper-to-bumper
traffic ever more frequently directed by female traffic officers.
   Policewomen wave automatic rifles out the windows of squad cars
as they escort ministers and dignitaries. Until 1981, the national
police force assigned women only to cases involving prostitution or
children.
   Sunday afternoon soccer, that ultimate male bastion, now has a
woman as one of the play-by-play radio commentators. The games are
not televised live.
   When the first woman justice was named to the Supreme Court in
September, she was asked what it meant to enter a world previously
reserved for men.
   ``It signifies that women are present, that they're doing their
job,'' Maria Gabriella Luccioli said. She began her judicial career
in 1963, when women were permitted to become magistrates.
   Marisa Occhionero, a Rome University sociologist who has done
studies for the government on the future of women, said the movement
into top positions is increasing and remains merely a ``question of
time.''
   ``Professors at universities ... engineers, businesswomen,
architects,'' she enumerated. ``They're not content to stay in civil
service jobs. The woman is changing. She has changed. It's the man
who hasn't changed.''
   Women in fields ranging from politics to banking echoed her
comment in interviews. They reported tremendous gains at work but
much less success in persuading men to help mind the house and
children.
   A survey of city families with both spouses working found the men
put in an average of 3-5 hours a week at such chores as home repairs
and cleaning the car while women did 33-35 hours of housework.
   Carole Beebe Tarantelli, an American who serves in the
Parliament, said changing sex roles are difficult for an Italian man
``whose mother would respond to every whim.''
   Newly married Italian men often are dismayed to discover that
their wives, working or not, will not iron their underwear like
their mothers did.
   ``The Italian woman's (struggle) is especially hard'' because of
the importance placed on the family and the concept of the mother as
its pillar, Ms. Occhionero said.
   It often is difficult to run an Italian family, given the
structure of Italian society, especially for working mothers.
   Mrs. Tarantelli, a mother, noted that public schools don't have
team sports or other extracurricular activities. That means
babysitters for children who finish classes at 1 p.m., five or six
hours before parents finish work.
   Stores close three hours for lunch and only a few stay open past
8 p.m. In the Tuscan hilltown of Arezzo, complaints by factory
workers that the only day care center shut down before the factory
did prompted the town to open another with more suitable hours.
   Gioia Longo, a cultural anthropologist who founded a hotline for
abused women, said a survey she did of 700 teen-agers in an Adriatic
resort town indicated girls see no limits on possible achievement
but boys are confused about their changing roles.
   Ms. Occhionero said stereotypical Latin males ``are afraid of
these women. They want to protect them but don't understand to what
point, (and) they are threatened.''
   Stefania Zappanico, a journalist in her 20s, says many women
don't help their cause.
   ``Italian women are still different from northern European or
American women,'' said Ms. Zappanico, who has spent time in Britain
and the United States. ``They're not mentally independent. Even
women who work think they have to depend on men. They don't value
independence that much in itself.''
   In a nationwide study of women's lot in the 1870s, the first
years of a unified Italy, an official in Bari said ``an ass, an ox,
a sheep are always worth more than a wife to the peasant, and the
wife obeys her husband like a slave.''
   A simple rendezvous could get a wife convicted of adultery a
brief generation ago but a husband could be prosecuted only if he
brought his lover to live in the house. A 1969 Supreme Court
decision led to adultery being abolished as a crime for either sex.
   Birth control pills were legalized in the early 1970s and
abortion in 1978.
   Children of an Italian man who marries a foreigner always have
qualified for citizenship automatically, but those of a woman in the
same situation did not qualify until 1984.
   Dictator Benito Mussolini thought a woman's place was home making
babies, but some historians feel his policy of getting women out of
the workplace helped them in the long run because many enrolled in
universities when they could not get jobs.
   As more and more Italian women enter politics, their issues are
certain to get more attention. Ms. Occhionero said women are ``ever
more present'' in the field but still scarce ``in proportion to
their effort.''

   The writer, an AP correspondent in Moscow for
four years, visited the shattered town of Spitak and found the
residents had the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute on their minds almost
as much as the devastating earthquake.

<DATELINE>SPITAK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exhausted and grief-stricken, Armenians
who have come to help their brothers in this devastated city are
stirred to passion when talk of their suffering touches on the
conflict with Azerbaijan.
   Despite the earthquake that has killed more than 50,000
Armenians, the simmering ethnic conflict between the neighboring
republics appears unabated.
   Spitak, virtually destroyed by the Dec. 7 quake, was one of the
cities of refuge for Armenians who fled homes in Azerbaijan after
the long-suppressed dispute between Christian Armenians and Moslem
Azerbaijanis burst into violent confrontation in February.
   Destruction of the refugees' homes by the earthquake has fueled
the hatred of some Armenians in this mountainous, backward
heartland, as well as the yearlong campaign for annexation of the
Azerbaijan-governed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Spitak has no means of communicating with the outside world, yet
rumors of Azerbaijani callousness in the wake of the disaster have
spread among the dispirited salvage workers and volunteers.
   ``The Azerbaijanis living in Armenia have been feasting and
celebrating for two days,'' said Edik Boganyan, driving his shovel
deeper into the powdery rubble of former housing with an impassioned
kick. ``They are rejoicing in our suffering.''
   The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict boiled to the surface of
conversation among a dozen Armenian villagers who spoke with a
reporter as they picked away at the piles of concrete and twisted
metal that is all that is left of Spitak. Other Armenians working
within earshot put down their tools and raced to add their own
denunciations.
   ``We have received aid from every corner of the world, but not
from Azerbaijan,'' said Varchik Azaryan. ``The Georgians have been
wonderful, they've done everything possible to help us, but not the
Azerbaijanis. They are jubilant.''
   Armenians in the capital of Yerevan contended Azerbaijanis had
sent leaflets ``congratulating'' Armenia on the occasion of its
worst-ever natural disaster.
   The Armenian claims about the Azerbaijanis could not be
confirmed, but they were spreading and infuriating the
earthquake-stricken populace.
   Yerevan activists over the weekend staged demonstrations pressing
for reunification with Nagorno-Karabakh, resulting in five arrests
and denunciations from top Kremlin officials.
   ``This is a present from (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev on
our day of mourning!'' activist Rafael Popoyan said of the
denunciations, reflecting a growing anti-Kremlin sentiment among
Armenians over Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Mayor Arzumanyan fled to Spitak from the Azerbaijani port of
Sumgait in March after extremists rampaged Feb. 28, killing 26
Armenians in the industrial city.
   ``I brought my family here after the riots because we couldn't
live there anymore,'' Arzumanyan said, standing amid the ruined
apartment he moved into only a month ago.
   ``The Armenians are the friendliest and most peace-loving people
in the world, and better relations with the Azerbaijanis is not up
to us, it's up to them!'' he said. ``I don't expect much to change
because of this tragedy.''
   Such outbursts have angered the Kremlin, which sees continued
attention on the ethnic dispute as unpatriotic single-mindedness
that cannot be tolerated in a time of crisis.
   ``We have to constantly put out fires these people are
starting,'' Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Monday,
denouncing nationalist activity in Yerevan.
   While many Russians and other Soviets likely share the official
view, their reaction illustrates a broad lack of understanding of
what drives the Armenian-Azerbaijani confrontation.
   The battle for Nagorno-Karabakh is not seen by Armenians as a
nationalist action or a divergence from the tenuous unity that holds
the 15 republics and 100 peoples of the Soviet Union together.
Rather, they view reunification as an imperative for ethnic and
social justice.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, enclosed by Azerbaijani territory, was part of
Armenia until 1923, when the Kremlin gave it to Azerbaijan when the
latter became a republic within the Soviet Union.
   Armenians have complained since Josef Stalin's death in 1953 that
Azerbaijani authorities discriminate against the Armenian majority
by closing churches, Armenian-language schools, libraries and
cultural centers.
   The issue has heated up as the influx of Azerbaijani workers to
Nagorno-Karabakh reduced the Armenian majority from 95 percent to
less than 75 percent.
   Growing fears the region would be lost to the Armenian motherland
forever and new opportunities for public activism opened by glasnost
unleashed long-stifled hostilities this year in a broad campaign to
reclaim Nagorno-Karabakh for Armenia.
   The sentiments expressed by those leading protests in Yerevan run
even deeper in distant regions like Spitak, where Armenian refugees
from Azerbaijan had sought and found solidarity.
   Armenians place their tragedies on equal rungs. When speaking of
recovering from the earthquake, Armenians often mention the 1915
Turkish massacre of 1.5 million Armenians and the loss of
Nagorno-Karabakh 65 years ago as examples of their tragic history.
   Recovery from the earthquake will be carried out with stubborn
resolve. Reunification with Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh will
continue to be a goal.
   Some Armenians, like Lev Akopian, take a pragmatic view of the
conflict and call for unity for the sake of survival.
   ``What is this lunacy of killing each other? Don't we have enough
problems?'' the Armenian who makes his home in the Georgian capital
of Tbilisi asked with frustration.
   Yasmina Akupyan, a Yerevan linguist helping foreign rescuers in
Spitak, said some of her countrymen will see the earthquake as a
sign from God that the violence must stop. ``We've been fighting for
nine months. We've had all these problems, and maybe now they will
be resolved with one tragic blow.''
   But the less-educated and more strident Armenians in the
underdeveloped regions of Armenia see continued conflict.
   Artur Tovmasyan blamed the Azerbaijanis for the deaths of
Armenians who sought refuge in Spitak from the ethnic clash.
   ``They were forced out of Azerbaijan! They didn't leave of their
own free will!'' he said, gesturing to piles of concrete where some
refugees were believed to have been buried by the quake. ``Look what
has happened to them! We will never get along with the
Azerbaijanis!''

   Indian fugitive Timothy Jacobs, who has
been sought on 14 kidnapping charges stemming from a newspaper
takeover, was arrested Tuesday in New York after a high-speed chase,
authorities said.
   Jacobs, 20, was being held at a county jail in Wampsville, N.Y.,
25 miles east of Syracuse. He was arraigned as a fugitive Tuesday
night in Lenox, N.Y., officials said.
   North Carolina authorities said they would begin extradition
proceedings, and a lawyer for Jacobs said he would fight the move.
   Sgt. Josephine Townsend of the state police in Oneida said police
tried to stop Jacobs about 4 p.m. for speeding on the New York State
Thruway 10 miles east of Syracuse. Police said Jacobs left the
thruway and drove at high speeds through two villages until his car
crashed into an empty school bus. No one was injured.
   Jacobs was indicted Dec. 6 during a special session the Robeson
County grand jury on state charges stemming from the Feb. 1 takeover
of The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, who was indicted on the same charges, was
arrested on the day the indictments were returned. He has been
released on $25,000 bond.
   A federal jury in October acquitted Hatcher and Jacobs of federal
hostage-taking and firearms charges. During the three-week trial,
the two Tuscarora Indians had argued that they had no other choice
but to take over the newspaper to save their lives.
   The pair said they had evidence linking county officials and law
enforcement officers to drug trafficking, and that evidence had put
their lives in jeopardy.
   Lewis Pitts, the founder of the Christic Institute South, a civil
rights law firm in Carrboro, N.C., that is representing Jacobs, said
Jacobs had found a job and delivering a load of arts and crafts
material when he was stopped by the trooper.
   ``What flashed in front of his eyes ... was the absolute danger
of returning to Robeson County, so he decided to flee,'' Lewis said.
   Authorities in North Carolina said Jacobs will be held in the New
York jail awaiting extradition proceedings. Pitts said Jacobs would
fight extradition to North Carolina rather than face what he called
``blatantly bad-faith prosecution.''

   Also Tuesday, the official newspaper Barricada said a girl was

   Rebels ambushed the Agriculture and Agrarian Reform Ministry

announced.
   The 92-foot-tall pyramid, soaring up between the Louvre's two

restoration facilities, bookstores, restaurants, boutiques as well
as access to subway stations and parking lots.
   Museum officials said Tuesday that a previously closed wing of
the Louvre would also open to the public for the first time,
displaying French painting from the primitive period through the

several languages besides French and a computerized board indicating
which rooms are closed.

dating back as much as 5,000 years, had been expected to sell for up
to $1.4 million, said Christie's spokesman William Hanham.
   Among the outstanding sales Tuesday were an inscribed bronze
vessel from 2000 B.C., which sold for $171,000 and a hollow-barreled
cylinder with royal inscriptions by the Babylonian king,
Nebuchadnezzar, which sold for $131,000, Hanham said.
   The collection had been gathered by the Swiss chemist Hans
Erlenmeyer and his wife Marie-Louise.

   Everglades National Park has welcomed its
one-millionth visitor for 1988, the first time in a decade the park
has attracted so many tourists in a year.
   The National Park Service arrived at the figure through its daily
use reports, with the lucky millionth visitor selected Saturday at
random and given free lodging, tours and canoe rental.
   ``Tourism to South Florida, especially foreign tourism, has been
increasing markedly in the last few years and we're benefiting from
it,'' said Patrick Czarny, marketing director for the Flamingo
Lodge, the only place to rent a room in the 1,300-square-mile park.
   ``We haven't done anything special to promote the park, but I
believe there is much more awareness of the Everglades and the
park's environmental significance,'' Czarny said Monday.
   The last time the park attracted 1 million visitors in a year was
in 1978. Visitation decreased to a 1983 low of 500,000 and has
steadily climbed since.

   Some state lawmakers might think he's been
more naughty than nice, but Gov. William Donald Schaefer told Santa
he's at least tried to be good this year.
   But even if Santa sides with the governor, he'll have a difficult
time getting everything Schaefer wants for Christmas down the
chimney of the governor's mansion.
   ``I have tried to be good in 1988 ... I answered 100,000 letters
from citizens who wrote to tell me they liked _ or didn't like _
what I was doing,'' Schaefer said in his letter to Santa. ``I even
put on 212 silly hats so the newspapers could take pictures of me in
unflattering poses.
   ``Now, Santa, my time has come. Here's what I want from you this
year.''
   Schaefer then ticked off a 17-point wish list that ranged from
better medical care and housing, more resources to help the
disadvantaged, better fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and a
professional football team.
   The governor also said he wouldn't mind winning the Maryland
lottery.
   Typically, Schaefer couldn't resist taking a dig at state
lawmakers, asking Santa to send 188 copies of a nonexistent book,
``Surplus Budgeting Made Easy,'' to ``my friends in the General
Assembly.''
   Schaefer and lawmakers are at odds on whether to spend a
projected surplus.

   Radio sports director Al Hacko thought
he made a safe bet, but it turned out to be a hair-raising
experience.
   On a WCCN radio talk show last week, the former Minnesota
resident flippantly said he would shave his head if the Green Bay
Packers beat the favored Minnesota Vikings in a National Football
League game Sunday.
   Hacko said he was at the game in Green Bay, ending in an 18-6
Packer victory, and ``cried his way home.''
   With plenty of onlookers at a tavern in this central Wisconsin
town, Hacko made good on his bet Monday, but kept his mustache. He

   A college football player from Mississippi learned
the hard way how expensive New York City can be. His teachers were a
limousine driver and a light-fingered pickpocket.
   Wesley Walls, the All-American tight end from the University of
Mississippi, likened himself to Crocodile Dundee, the movie
character who visited New York from Australia.
   ``I went up there and learned a couple of lessons,'' Walls
recalled Monday as he and the other members of The Associated Press
All-America team taped Bob Hope's Christmas Special in Miami.
   He went to New York to be honored last week as one of the
National Football Foundation's scholar-athletes. A limousine driver
charged him $85 for ride to a Manhattan hotel, less than 10 miles
from the airport.
   Then someone took $180 from his pocket at a disco.
   But Walls said his trip wasn't all bad.
   ``I found out the people were more friendly than I thought they'd
be. I was being super-nice and they were being nice back. It was
good hospitality _ not Southern hospitality, but close.''
   Walls wouldn't even mind being drafted by the New York Giants or
New York Jets, who both actually play their games in New Jersey.
   ``I'd come back and be a lot smarter,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   If a country needs enemies to retain its
identity, the United States could be in big trouble.
   Ten years have passed since the United States officially
recognized China, making this an appropriate time to dwell on a
contemporary phenomenon: Americans have fewer people to loathe these
days.
   China has been transformed from the totalitarian, expansionist
``yellow peril'' into a gang of capitalist roaders, a billion
strong, who see nothing wrong with making a buck and cutting deals
with Washington.
   Friendship with China seems so normal these days that people have
forgotten the shock that President Carter caused on Dec. 15, 1978,
when he announced that the United States was dropping Taiwan for the
People's Republic.
   Even more remarkable is the transformation in relations with the
Soviet Union. Five years ago, President Reagan was engaging in his
``evil empire'' rhetoric about the Soviets, and Americans were
pouring Russian vodka down the drain to protest the shooting down of
a Korean Air Lines passenger plane by a Soviet missile.
   Nowadays, President Mikhail Gorbachev gets uniformly high marks
in U.S. public opinion polls and Americans are sending relief
packages to earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia. U.S. government
and private donations as of Monday totaled $3.2 million.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday the
response merely reflects the magnitude of the disaster in Armenia
but it seems improbable that a comparable level of generosity would
have been in evidence if the tragedy had occurred in that vintage
Cold War year, 1983.
   ``Who today are the men we love to hate?'' asked Charles Paul
Freund of the Washington Post.
   He recalled that Georgi Arbatov, Moscow's leading U.S. expert,
once said facetiously that the Soviet show of friendship was really
an anti-American plot.
   ``We'll deprive America of its enemy,'' Arbatov reportedly said,
forcing the United States to focus on internal problems. Heretofore,
American attention had been diverted by the need to contain the
communist menace.
   ``I don't know what we will do,'' former CIA official Graham
Fuller said last week, ``without the Soviet Union as a touchstone
for Third World policy.''
   The Soviet Union and China are not the only nations that have
disappeared from the American pantheon of evildoers. Latin America,
for example, is running low on military dictators, long a favorite
target of Democrats.
   Even Chile's military president, Augusto Pinochet, has quieted
his myriad critics by holding a free and fair election. He even had
the decency to lose it.
   In Africa, Uganda's Idi Amin has been reduced to irrelevant
exile. Libya's Moammar Gadhafi doesn't seem to arouse as much
indignation as he did before the U.S. Air Force bombed him.
   Remember OPEC? Hatred for that group disappeared with the gas
lines.
   The Nicaraguan Contras, America's least favorite anti-communist
guerrilla group, have won a measure of sympathy lately as word has
spread that they have been leading a deprived existence at pathetic
camps along the Honduran border.
   To be sure, there are people abroad against whom Americans can
rally. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini still rules Iran under a ``death
to America'' banner. And his friends in Lebanon who continue to hold
Americans hostage are viewed almost universally by Americans as
perhaps the world's least congenial people.
   Finally, there is Fidel Castro, who in two weeks will celebrate
30 years of non-stop anti-Americanism.
   Speaking before a crowd of half a million last week, Castro said,
the United States ``will never forgive'' Cuba for the revolution it
has carried out.
   ``Not only did it aggravate the pride of the empire,'' Castro
said, ``it also delivered a profound wound to its imperial
interests.''
   Castro is one adversary who won't let down Americans who have a
psychic need for a foreign devil, whether real or imagined. He
hasn't changed in three decades and next month, George Bush will
become the eighth American president with whom Castro has been
unable to get along.

<TEXT>
   Interest rates, which have been rising since
the election, will be headed still higher in the months ahead as the
Federal Reserve steps up its inflation-fighting efforts, many
economists believe.
   These analysts are predicting rising mortgage rates and another
boost in banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark rate for many
consumer and business loans.
   This forecast, if it proves accurate, would likely put the
central bank on a collision course with the Bush administration,
which is counting on strong economic growth and falling interest
rates to help it trim the federal deficit without resorting to new
taxes.
   Many economists believe the Fed has already started tightening
credit conditions and they expect further efforts along that line
when Fed policy-makers meet behind closed doors today and Wednesday
to review the performance of the economy and make revisions to
monetary strategy.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, headed by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, meets eight times a year to set guidelines
for monetary policy consistent with the bank's job of promoting
non-inflationary growth.
   While the economy is now in its seventh year of expansion without
a downturn, Fed officials have expressed concerns that tight labor
markets and high factory operating rates could spur a new
inflationary spiral.
   Recent signs of economic strength, including a strong
unemployment report for November, have many analysts convinced that
Fed policymakers believe the economy may be overheating.
   ``From an economic standpoint the Fed clearly should tighten,''
said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm bearing his
name. ``The economy is strong and all sorts of inflationary signs
are cropping up.''
   Many analysts say they have detected signs that the Fed is
tightening credit behind the scenes. They note that the federal
funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight
loans, has been rising. It averaged 8.59 percent last week, the
highest weekly average in two years and up from 8.44 percent the
week before.
   This rate often serves as an early-warning signal that the Fed is
making moves to restrict the amount of reserves banks have on hand
to make loans.
   ``I think the Fed believes we are at full employment and we can't
tolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit the
brakes,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist of Data
Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   But the Fed's efforts will make Bush's goal of reducing the
budget deficit that much harder because it means economic growth
will be slower and the government's tax take lower and interest
rates on the $2.6 trillion national debt will be higher.
   The Fed is projecting economic growth, as measured by the Gross
National Product, of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, far below the
Reagan administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year.
   But economists detect no signals that the Fed will back off its
view that the economy can't afford to grow at those rates without
rekindling inflation.
   ``If the Fed has its way, the Bush administration will not have
its way and that means government revenues will be lower and the
budget deficit higher,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co.
   Many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to move
up to 11 percent by late January, with similar increases in other
interest rates. Major banks boosted the prime rate by one-half
percentage point just two weeks ago, to 10.5 percent, the highest
since mid-1985.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer, said he expects mortgage rates, now
averaging around 10.46 percent for fixed-rate mortgages, will start
climbing as well.
   ``By early next year, I would look for mortgage rates to be
around 11 percent to 11.25 percent and rising,'' he said. ``Mortgage
borrowers should borrow now instead of waiting.''
   Many economists said they were looking for an increase in the
Fed's discount rate, the interest the central bank charges on loans
to member commercial banks, by the end of January.
   The last increase in the discount rate, the most dramatic signal
the Fed can send of its intention to push interest rates higher,
occurred on Aug. 9, when the rate was increased to 6.5 percent,
capping a series of credit-tightening moves the central bank had
begun in late March.
   The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of members of the
Federal Reserve Board and presidents of its regional banks. It meets
in private every six to eight weeks; decisions are not disclosed
until after the next meeting is held.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major obstacles to an Iran-Contra trial of
Oliver L. North were removed when the judge in the case sharply
restricted the number of classified documents the former White House
aide may use for his defense.
   By deciding to bar as evidence more than 90 percent of the
classified documents North wanted to disclose, U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell greatly increased the chances that the case will
go to trial, possibly late next month.
   Gesell's ruling diminishes the possibility that President
Reagan's refusal to release virtually all the secrets sought by
North would force dismissal of charges on the ground that the former
National Security Council aide couldn't get a fair trial.
   The judge harshly rebuked North for demanding ``disclosure of
masses of classified material which under no conceivable version of
a defense could have any utility whatsoever.''
   ``North, as a tactical matter, has taken an obdurate stand,''
Gesell said in an order issued Monday. ``If this tactic were
permitted, there would be no trial.''
   Gesell rejected a Nov. 14 list of 3,500 documents covering 30,000
pages of secrets that North had proposed as evidence under a
provision of the Classified Information Procedures Act.
   But the judge denied independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's
request to bar North completely from disclosing any secrets, saying
a blanket prohibition would ``too severely restrict the defense.''
   Instead, Gesell gave North until Jan. 3 to pick 300 documents
from the Nov. 14 list that he wants to use as evidence. The
documents will be censored for sensitive references to secret
information by an interagency task force that reviewed Walsh's
exhibits.
   The defense will be required to show the ``relevancy and
materiality of each item and generalities will not be accepted,''
Gesell said.
   Gesell granted Walsh's request to censor some of the 300
documents the independent prosecutor wants to use as evidence to
prove that North conspired to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North had objected to virtually all of the deletions of sensitive
information. But Gesell approved many of the changes, such as
censoring the names of CIA agents, foreign officials and the sources
of U.S. intelligence.
   He also approved Walsh's proposal to remove sensitive information
from the orders by President Reagan approving the arms-for-hostage
initiatives.
   But the judge made clear that he wants public disclosure of as
much evidence as possible, denying requests to delete the names of
Central American countries, Israel and Iran from documents in the
case.
   Gesell noted that an earlier evidence proposal by North, on Aug.
1, also was rejected after a check of some of the documents listed
showed it was ``obviously submitted in bad faith.''
   Since then the court has repeatedly reminded North that he must
provide specific information about how a document would help his
case.
   Despite those warnings, the Nov. 14 notice contains ``ample
evidence of North's attempt to frustrate the prosecution,'' the
judge said.
   ``North's unwillingness to pay token respect to the court's
requirement to provide detail appears to reflect his mistaken view
that he is entitled to use classified materials at trial without
indicating in any way the significance of that material to the
prosecution and the court,'' Gesell said.
   ``This trial does not concern the reaction of various Central
American countries to congressional legislation, the life history of
a potential defector, the precise distribution of Sandinista forces
at a particular time among various villages,'' Gesell said, listing
the type of secrets North proposed to disclose.
   ``This is a case charging fraud and deceit on the United States,
its chief executive and Congress, involving the use of arms profits
in a manner allegedly unauthorized by the president,'' the judge
said. ``It must remain focused on these issues, rather than be
derailed by the myriad unrelated issues'' raised by North.
   North still has until Dec. 19 to submit an additional list of
secrets he wants to disclose in testimony or from other documents
not covered in the Nov. 14 notice.
   But Gesell's order made clear that he would reject a list that
was similar to those previously filed.
   North's lawyers, meanwhile, sought a one-month delay in filing
the next notice and argued that disclosing defense testimony will
violate the former White House aide's right to a fair trial.
   ``Never before in the history of American criminal law has a
court granted the prosecution such a one-sided bonanza of
information about the defense case,'' lawyers Brendan V. Sullivan
Jr. and Barry S. Simon said in the pleading filed Monday.

   Union officials say steelworkers could gain up
to $10 million in back pay as a result of an arbitration board's
ruling against USX Corp.
   The board's ruling, released by the United Steelworkers of
America on Monday, compels USX to reimburse workers at overtime
rates in instances _ totaling as many as 1,100 _ where work was lost
because of outside hiring that violated the steelworkers' contract,
union officials said.
   ``It's an enormous victory for the union that shows that what
we've said about contracting out is true,'' Steelworkers union
president Lynn Williams told reporters.
   The arbitration board examined 24 grievances at the company's
Fairless Works outside Philadelphia. The union and the company
selected those cases because they were said to represent some 1,100
pending complaints by workers.
   The board held that back pay was entitled in all but five of the
24 cases. No award was granted in three, and the remaining two were
returned to the parties for more information before a final decision
is rendered.
   The union studied the back pay awards and found one to be worth
about $700,000.
   ``Another of the 24 test cases involved 900-1,000 hours and
several involved 200-300 hours. If these are typical of the 1,100
pending cases, the company's liability should easily reach $8
million to $10 million,'' union leaders said in a memorandum to
members.
   The document urged workers to ``guard against wheeling and
dealing aimed at selling your jobs to outside contractors or buying
the right to do so.'' The issue of outside hiring had been central
to a six-month walkout by USX workers in 1987.
   In his decision, arbitration board chairman Alfred Dybeck also
said that after one year, a ``cease and desist'' order will be in
effect barring outside hiring for specified types of work.
   Maintenance, repair and service work were all at issue in the
case. USX conceded that it hired from outside, but argued that no
remedy should be imposed because Fairless workers were already fully
employed and many were working overtime.
   The union countered that employees could have worked more
overtime than what was offered.
   Fairless is one of the last plants to use open-hearth
steelmaking, which dominated the industry for years. It is the
oldest steelmaking technology in use in the country.
   ``Our recent contracting out procedures there have been affected
by the severe shortage of skilled labor in the area around the
plant,'' USX spokesman Tom Farrell said in a telephone interview
from Pittsburgh. ``We have encountered some difficulty in hiring
qualified people for certain crafts,'' he said.
   Farrell said the company was still interpreting the ruling and
had no immediate comment on it.

<HEAD>Reagan Meets With Indian Leaders; Can't Remember `Primitive' Remark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

   American Indian leaders say they are generally
pleased with their meeting with President Reagan, but say they hope
White House invitations will be more frequent in the Bush
administration.
   Indian leaders had been seeking a meeting with Reagan for more
than six months, ever since he said U.S. officials might have erred
in allowing Indians to continue to live in their ``primitive ways.''
He made the comment during a question-and-answer session with
students at Moscow State University last May.
   Reagan told reporters Monday, ``I don't recall saying that.''
   The president's spokesman quoted the president as telling the 16
Indian leaders from 11 states: ``Indians should have the right to
choose their own life _ the right to have a say in what happens in
Indian country.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration had trouble
arranging Monday's meeting because of difficulty in deciding which
Indian representatives to invite; there are more than 500 American
Indian tribes.
   But Ivan Sidney, chairman of the Hopi Tribe of Kykotsmovi, Ariz.,
told reporters after the Cabinet Room session that Reagan's comments
in Moscow last May ``indicated that there needed to be a contact by
the native people directly with the White House.''
   Reagan, in Moscow for his summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, had said he was willing to meet ``any time'' with Indians
seeking to air grievances.
   That demand was heightened after he went on to tell his Soviet
audience that the U.S. government may have made a mistake in
allowing Indians to pursue their ``primitive lifestyle'' rather than
becoming citizens ``with the rest of us.''
   Discussing the ``primitive lifestyle'' statement, Reagan told
reporters during a picture-taking session that ``I don't recall
saying that. I tried in response to a question to explain that
theirs was a freedom, as with all the people of America, a freedom
that is quite different'' from the situation in the Soviet Union.
   Edgar L. French Jr. of Anadarko, Okla., president of the Delaware
Tribes of Western Oklahoma, said that he had signed a letter to the
president from Oklahoma tribal leaders ``stating that he was very
wrong.''
   However, said French, ``It's been said, and we've said what we
wanted to say against it, and let it go. We need to look to the
future, not to what's behind us. The number one problem is economic
development on the reservations.''
   Eddie L. Tullis of Atmore, Ala., tribal chairman of the Poarch
Band of Creek Indians, said the president's remarks ``served a very
useful purpose of raising his consciousness of the need for us to
communicate on a government-to-government basis.''
   ``It could serve a very great purpose if the new administration
builds on what has been started here today,'' Tullis said.
   When the president was asked why it took so long to arrange the
meeting, he said, ``Because I was never apprised that a meeting was
being sought.'' Presidential aides, including Fitzwater, met in
California last August with one Indian group seeking an audience
with the president.
   Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel, meeting with reporters
after the meeting, said, ``We want to strengthen the ability of the
tribes to help themselves while maintaining the special
relationship.''
   Ross O. Swimmer, assistant secretary of the interior for Indian
affairs, asked who selected the Indian leaders to be invited, said,
``We shared that responsibility with the White House.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Coats of Indiana will succeed Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle in the Senate, once again following his
mentor into a congressional job.
   A conservative in Quayle's mold, Coats got his start in politics
as an aide to Quayle and went on to win Quayle's old House seat when
the vice president-elect moved up to the Senate in 1980.
   Indiana Gov. Robert D. Orr, announcing the Senate appointment on
Monday, said Coats ``represents values near and dear to the people
of Indiana.''
   Quayle praised the Republican congressman as a dedicated family
man and trusted friend. Coats was known to be Quayle's choice for
the job, but the vice president-elect turned aside suggestions that
Coats was his handpicked successor.
   ``This was a one-man vote. The governor made the decision. ... I
did not make any specific recommendation,'' Quayle said.
   Coats promised to work hard for his Indiana constituents.
   ``I realize I'm not their elected senator. I'm their appointed
senator. I hope over the next two years to work my very hardest to
earn their respect and support,'' he said.
   His selection makes no change in the Democratic-Republican split
in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the new
Congress.
   Coats will serve until a special election is held in 1990 for the
remaining two years of Quayle's term. An election for a full
six-year Senate term will be held in 1992.
   Coats' House seat will be filled through a special election, with
Democratic and Republican caucuses nominating candidates to succeed
him.
   Coats was born in Jackson, Mich., graduated from Wheaton College
and then served in the Army. Like Quayle, he obtained his law degree
from Indiana University.
   He worked in Quayle's congressional office in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
from 1976 to 1980. When Quayle decided to run for the Senate in
1980, Coats won the 4th Congressional District seat.
   In the House, Coats compiled a conservative record that drew an
82 percent approval rating in 1986 from the American Conservative
Union.
   He is a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and to the
Angolan rebels. In 1984, he attempted to attach to an education bill
an amendment to cut off federal aid to schools and states banning
voluntary school prayer. The amendment was defeated.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Coats will represent
Hoosiers in the Senate ``with vigor and commitment to their
heartland values.''
   Quayle has announced he will resign, probably effective Jan. 2,
to allow his successor to gain seniority by being sworn in before
the rest of the Senate on Jan. 3. However, Coats said he expects to
be sworn in with his colleagues.
   Because of rule changes in 1980, a senator sworn in before others
does not necessarily gain a head start in committee assignments or
other advantages. But Coats will have some seniority over most other
new senators because of his eight years' House service.

<HEAD>Despite Drought, Cotton Crop At Seven-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 cotton crop mostly escaped the ravages
of drought and is expected to total a seven-year high of 15.2
million bales, up 3 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent
more than forecast a month ago, the Agriculture Department says.
   Based on field conditions as of Dec. 1, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said Monday, cotton production would
be the largest since 15.6 million bales were harvested in 1981.
   Counting almost 5.8 million bales left over from earlier
harvests, the total U.S. cotton supply in the 1988-89 marketing year
is expected to be about 21 million bales, the most in 20 years,
analysts said in a related supply-and-demand report.
   Exports may require only 6.9 million bales in 1988-89, down from
more than 7.6 million last marketing year, reflecting ``fierce
competition'' in the world cotton trade, the report said.
   The increased 1988 cotton harvest resulted from a larger acreage,
up 16 percent from 1987, while average yields per acre declined from
last year.
   As a result of the cotton outlook, USDA on Oct. 31 announced that
farmers will have to reduce their acreage 25 percent next year to
qualify for the price support program.
   The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year at
19.1 million hundredweight, down 26 percent from last year, and
burley tobacco production at 459 million pounds, up 9 percent from
the 1987 harvest.
   Orange production, at 215 million boxes, is up 9 percent from
last season.
   The report did not include new 1988 production figures for other
major crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans; production totals for
those crops will be released Jan. 13.
   Planting of winter wheat for the 1989 harvest was 95 percent
completed by Nov. 1, about 5 percentage points ahead of average, the
report said. But lack of moisture hampered development in much of
the major growing areas.
   ``Near the end of the month, rain and snow provided needed
moisture in portions of the plains and Pacific Northwest,'' the
report said. ``Greenbugs continued to be a problem in Kansas and
Texas. In Texas, central and southern areas remained dry and showed
little or no growth.''

   Timber harvesting in certain parts of national
forests in Oregon and Washington will be barred in order to broaden
habitat protection for the spotted owl, says the Agriculture
Department.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said Monday that
most of the new habitat areas will range from 1,000 to 2,000 acres
in size, and will serve as protection for nesting owls as well as
providing ``stepping stones'' between larger areas, totaling more
than 1.6 million acres, already protected as owl habitats.
   In the Olympic National Forest, the new habitat areas may be as
large as 3,000 acres each, he said.
   In all, the special habitat areas are expected to reduce the
annual timber harvest on national forests in Oregon and Washington
by about 180 million board feet.
   Each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in the
linkage system. The exact number will not be determined until the
forests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owl
populations will be maintained.
   ``This has been an extremely difficult decision to make, but I
believe it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflicting
goals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timber
supplies that are vital to the economies of Oregon and Washington,''
Robertson said.
   The Forest Service, a USDA agency, has been embroiled in
controversy concerning its management plans for spotted owl
habitats, notably in the Pacific Northwest where some people are
concerned that protection of the birds could adversely affect the
timber industry.
   However, Robertson said the controversy has not been confined to
his agency, noting that a lawsuit against Interior's Bureau of Land
Management has resulted in an injunction prohibiting the bureau from
harvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers in
Oregon.
   Also, the Fish and Wildlife Service is being challenged in court
over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or
endangered species.

   The Agriculture Department has formally adopted
a rule allowing processors to use certain acidic substances to keep
supermarket pork chops looking pink and appetizing.
   The rule takes effect Jan. 11.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, said the agency has permitted use of the
additives since September 1986 but it held off making a final
decision until public comments had been submitted.
   The substances are ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid,
sodium ascorbate and sodium citrate, which are used in fresh cuts of
pork to maintain the meat's color.
   ``The use of these substances in the product does not pose a
health risk,'' Crawford said. ``Fresh pork loses its color long
before it becomes unsafe. The color change makes the product
unappealing.''
   Product labels will identify the added substances and the reason
for their use, he said, for example: ``Sprayed with a solution of
water, ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color.''

   The Federal Communications Commission will
examine on a ``case-by-case basis'' requests to waive its rule
prohibiting direct ownership, operation or control of both a radio
and television station in the same market.
   Although the panel stresses it is retaining the
``one-to-a-market'' rule, Monday's decision drastically relaxes the
restriction on common ownership of commercial television and radio
stations in the same market.
   The one-to-a-market rule prohibits ownership of a radio and VHF
television station or any broadcast operation and a daily newspaper
in the same market. Exceptions to the 1970 rule are considered only
when it involves a UHF television station and radio stations in the
same community.
   ``Although we would retain the current radio-TV cross ownership
rule we would entertain waivers of the rule on a case-by-case-basis
if certain specified criteria were met,'' said FCC staffer Michele
Farquhar, primary author of the proposal.
   The change means the commission will consider exceptions to the
one-to-a market rule in any circumstances where its waiver criteria
are met and the public interest benefits would outweigh the costs of
broadcast combinations, but it focused on the nation's top 25
television markets.
   ``The FCC will look favorably upon the grant of waiver
applications where those applications involve radio and television
stations located in the top 25 markets where at least 30 separately
owned or operated ... `voices' would remain after the proposed
combination,'' the panel said in a statement.
   ``I think we have a moderate approach,'' said Commissioner James
Quello in voting for the proposal. He said the exclusion of several
other broadcast classifications such as cable and satellite and the
insistence on 30 ``voices'' in top markets should ensure the
diversity in programming the commission seeks to maintain.
   The current UHF television and radio waiver evaluation would be
replaced by the new rule.
   Since the FCC decision did not include waivers already granted,
exemptions to the current one-to-a-market rule granted to Capital
Cities-ABC, Inc. and the Taft Broadcasting Co. could be revaluated
following Monday's decision.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick, who voted for the rule change, said
there was overwhelming support for the change among parties offering
comment to the commission.
   Commissioner Patricia Dennis declined to vote, saying the
original proposal had been ``substantially'' changed in negotiations
minutes before the commission meeting.

<TEXT>
   Immigration officials, gearing up for a crush
of Nicaraguans seeking asylum in the United States, are proposing
changes that might make it more difficult for them to work here
legally.
   One change would require that asylum applications be reviewed by
immigration officers before the asylum-seeker is allowed to work in
this country, according to an internal document prepared at the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service and obtained by The
Associated Press.
   Under another change, asylum applicants would have to make a
stronger case for receiving a work permit than they do now,
according to the document.
   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson is to meet this week with Associate
Attorney General Francis Keating to discuss the INS proposals.
   A Justice Department policy adopted in July 1987 by then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III encouraged INS officials to expedite
Nicaraguan applications for work authorizations.
   Since the Meese directive was put in place, any Nicaraguan who
applied for political asylum has almost automatically been granted a
work permit while his application was being processed.
   The 1987 policy was hailed by most Nicaraguans, who said the
action should have been taken earlier.
   The INS hasn't acted on many asylum applications from
Nicaraguans, but that is apparently about to change.
   In the past year and a half, there has been a sharp increase in
the number of asylum applications from Central Americans, most of
whom cross the border illegally in the Harlingen, Texas, area.
   There is a backlog of nearly 12,000 asylum applications from
Nicaraguans who have come here illegally, INS officials have said,
and an estimated 5,000 more Nicaraguans who have come here illegally
and who haven't filed asylum applications.
   One of the internal INS documents is a two-page memo dated Dec. 5
from the office of INS deputy commissioner James Buck and entitled
``Nicaraguan Asylum, Harlingen Situation.'' It says that an INS
staffer had been directed to prepare a document ``which Keating may
use to support the argument for rescission of the Meese memo
regarding Nicaraguans (requested by Keating).'' The memo was sent to
Keating on Dec. 2, according to the document.
   INS commissioner Alan Nelson had earlier favored rescinding the
Meese memo, according to Justice Department sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity. However, said the sources, Nelson has
changed his mind and has decided not to recommend rescinding or
revising the Meese directive, but rather to make other changes to
address the Nicaraguan question, said the sources.
   It could not be determined what Keating's position on the Meese
directive is or why Nelson had changed his mind.
   A separate INS document proposes that a clarification be sent to
INS field offices immediately informing the field that ``the Meese
memorandum of July 2, 1987 does not require automatic granting of
work authorization to asylum applicants whose claims are frivolous.''
   Another proposal is to establish a procedure under which those
who have filed asylum applications most recently would be reviewed
first under what one of the internal documents calls ``last in,
first out adjudications procedures.'' The INS has not acted on many
of the Nicaraguan asylum applications filed in the past year and a
half and the proposal would mean an additional waiting period for
that group.
   INS spokesman Greg Leo declined Thursday night to discuss any of
the proposals and Justice Department spokesman Joseph Krovisky
declined comment.
   The INS is gearing up to address the crush of applications,
according to the INS documents and agency sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Sixteen INS examiners and eight support staff would be detailed
to Harlingen ``to maintain an appropriate asylum processing level
for a 30-day period,'' according to the internal INS documents
detailing the INS proposals.
   Another step being proposed is to press the State Department to
``secure the assistance of Mexico and Central American countries to
slow down the flow of illegal aliens into the United States,'' the
documents said.

<HEAD>Government Ordered To Speed Examination Of Surplus Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has been ordered by a
federal judge to make faster decisions on whether surplus or excess
government property can be used as shelter for the homeless.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch on Monday gave the government
until Dec. 28 to determine if at least half the 350 listed
properties were suitable for sheltering homeless people.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development was given until
Jan. 12 to survey the rest of the property, which covers more than
1,000 buildings. HUD was also required to publish weekly in the
Federal Register a list of all properties deemed suitable to house
homeless people.
   The decision was made in a lawsuit brought by the National
Coalition for the Homeless, which had accused the Reagan
administration of not implementing the McKinney Emergency Homeless
Assistance Act.
   The law, named for the late Rep. Stewart McKinney, R-Conn.,
requires the government to survey surplus federal property to
determine if the facilities may be used for shelters.
   No piece of federal property has been turned over for use as a
homeless shelter since the McKinney law was passed last year,
attorney Jeffrey Pash said at Monday's hearing.
   Gasch also ruled that once a property is classified suitable for
a shelter, it cannot be made available for any other purpose for 30
days while the government reviews applications by homeless groups to
take over the facility.
   Gasch made the ruling after attorneys for the homeless coalition
accused the General Services Administration of selling a property in
Suffolk, Mass., that had been deemed suitable for use as a shelter.
   ``What this means is that the government is now required to
actually make available a very significant amount of property to
people who are on the street and to do so very quickly under a
strict schedule,'' said Maria Foscarinis, Washington counsel.
   HUD was also ordered to canvass federal agencies quarterly to get
an updated list of surplus, excess and under-utilized property. HUD
was also directed to conduct suitability studies of each property in
those categories within two months.
   Gasch also directed the government to give him monthly status
reports on the program.

   A crewman aboard an Indian merchant ship was
killed Monday when the ship was struck by a half-ton practice
missile launched from a Navy jet during a military exercise, the
Navy announced.
   The non-explosive missile was fired at a target hulk ship, but
its guidance system locked onto the merchant vessel Jagvivek which
was not supposed to be within the Navy's Pacific Missile range, the
Navy said.
   The missile hit the topside superstructure of the merchant ship,
fatally injuring the crewmember, the Navy said.
   The accident took place 80 miles north-northwest of the island of
Kauai within an area of several thousand square miles of ocean which
had been closed to merchant vessels by a notice to mariners issued
by the Navy on Thursday, the statement said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Gary E. Shrout, a Navy spokesman, said the ship had
been en route to Singapore but he didn't know what it contained or
where it was heading from.
   There was no report of any other injuries. The identity of the
crewman was not immediately disclosed.
   After the accident, the 250-foot Jagvivek headed under its own
power to Honolulu for further damage assessment and possible
repairs, the Navy said in a statement. The ship was expected to
reach here Tuesday morning.
   The FA-18 Hornet jet that fired the anti-ship missile was from
the USS Constellation. The carrier and its seven-ship battle group
was conducting exercises, en route to a Western Pacific deployment,
the Navy said.
   The Harpoon missile has a range of 65 miles and was launched from
the jet toward the target ship many miles out to sea, the Navy said.
   ``Unfortunately, the exercise missile was fired close enough to
the path of the merchant vessel for the missile's seeker to guide on
it instead of the original target,'' said a statement issued by the
Navy at Pearl Harbor.
   A Navy helicopter took the victim's body to Wilcox Memorial
Hospital on the island of Kauai, according to Kauai police.
   The Harpoon missile is more than 12 feet long, weighs more than
1,000 pounds and flies at supersonic speed, guided by an imaging
infrared seeker that locks onto the target, according to Jane's All
The World's Aircraft.
   The warnings for merchant ships to avoid the Pacific Missile
Range are included in routine advisories transmitted on marine radio
frequencies at set times throughout the day, according to the Coast
Guard.

   A group of entertainers and journalists led by
actors Dudley Moore and Bruce Willis are urging the nation to
remember that nine Americans face another Christmas held hostage in
Lebanon.
   ``Say a prayer, light a candle, send a letter, tie a yellow
ribbon _ do something. Show the hostages that we care,'' Moore,
co-chairman of the Operation Hostage Freedom committee, said in a
statement.
   The committee is the brainchild of Leonard Saffir, president of
the Overseas Press Club of America, and Peggy Say, sister of Terry
Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent who
was captured on March 16, 1985.
   Anderson has been held longer than any other American hostage.
   In Lebanon on Monday, kidnappers holding U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins said in a statement they have sentenced him to
death for alleged spying for Israel. Higgins has been held since
Feb. 17.
   ``It would seem that some Americans care more about whales than
nine of their fellow citizens held hostage,'' Saffir said. ``Let's
save our whales and our hostages, too.''
   The group plans a series of newspaper advertisements and public
service radio announcements to publicize the hostages' plight.
   Other celebrities on the committee include Woody Allen, Phil

<HEAD>Theft Leaves Police On Duck Hunt</HEAD>

   Police are on a duck hunt, but so far have no leads
in the theft of a bronze duckling from a park.
   The duckling was one of eight waddling after their mother in a
sculpture that dramatizes Robert McCloskey's children's tale, ``Make
Way for Ducklings.'' In the story, a family of ducks wanders about
the Beacon Hill neighboorhood before a friendly policeman helps them
find a home in the Public Garden.
   Sculptor Nancy Schon discovered Saturday that the eighth member
of the bronze brood had been swiped. The duckling, about 12 inches
high and weighing 60 pounds, apparently was removed with a blow
torch.
   ``We're aghast that some individual would be so petty as to
destroy the dreams of little children who come from all over
metropolitan Boston to see these little ducklings,'' said Victoria
Williams, assistant commissioner for the Olmsted Administration,
which oversees the Public Garden.
   ``We will replace the duck,'' she said Monday.

   A National Academy of Sciences panel says a
medical system that is not geared towards preventive medicine is
leaving most family doctors inadequately trained to treat illnesses
caused by unhealthy environments.
   The Institute of Medicine, in a report issued Monday, called for
establishment of a clearinghouse for doctors to call ``when
confronted with a patient suspected of having an occupational or
environmental disease.''
   The Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, is forming an advisory committee to draw up more detailed
suggestions for such a clearinghouse.
   ``It should be designed so that a single telephone call satisfies
the practitioner's informational needs,'' the report said. ``It
could be based on an extension of the techniques used by the
nation's poison control centers.''

<HEAD>In a Holiday Season for Comedies, `Twins' Debuts as No. 1 Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The holiday box-office sweepstakes is proving
lucrative for comedies as ``Twins,'' starring Danny DeVito and
Arnold Schwarzenegger as the unlikely brothers, debuted at No. 1 at
the nation's movie theaters.
   ``Twins'' grossed $11.2 million last weekend, topping two other
comedies, according to figures released by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' a send-up of
law enforcement, finished in second with $6.1 million, down sharply
from its strong opening the previous week.
   In third was ``Scrooged,'' Bill Murray's comic reworking of the
Dickens Christmas classic, which collected $4.7 million.
   The moody drama ``Tequila Sunrise,'' starring Mel Gibson and
Michelle Pfeiffer, claimed fourth place with $4 million. Next was
the animated ``Oliver & Company,'' an Oliver Twist-inspired story
about a homeless kitten, which collected $2.5 million.
   ``Oliver & Company'' appears to be winning the season's animation
battle, as its chief animated rival, ``The Land Before Time,'' fell
to sixth place with sales of $2.14 million even though it is playing
on more movie screens than ``Oliver.''
   The newly formed Weintraub Entertainment Group's string of
box-office flops continued with a very lackluster opening for ``My
Stepmother is an Alien.'' On the heels of Weintraub's failed ``Fresh
Horses'' and ``The Big Blue,'' ``My Stepmother is an Alien,''
starring Dan Aykroyd and Kim Basinger, brought in only $2.07 million
in its first week of release.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' in eighth
with $1.5 million, ``Child's Play'' with $1.3 million and ``Cocoon:
The Return,'' with $950,000.
   The holiday movie season continues this week with ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels'' and ``Torch Song Trilogy'' opening Wednesday and ``Rain
Man'' opening Friday.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Twins,'' Universal, $11.2 million, 1,396 screens, $8,005 per
screen, $11.2 million, one week.
   2. ``The Naked Gun,'' Paramount, $6.1 million, 1,576 screens,
$3,883 per screen, $18.3 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Scrooged,'' Paramount, $4.7 million, 1,326 screens, $3,523
per screen, $36 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Tequila Sunrise,'' Warner Bros., $4 million, 1,115 screens,
$3,591 per screen, $12.5 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Oliver & Company,'' Disney, $2.5 million, 952 screens,
$2,634 per screen, $19.3 million, four weeks.
   6. ``The Land Before Time,'' Universal, $2.14 million, 1,384
screens, $1,550 per screen, $26 million, four weeks.
   7. ``My Stepmother is an Alien,'' Weintraub, $2.07 million, 1,106

   8. ``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' Disney, $1.5 million, 1,553

   George Lucas' film company is suing a firm
that sells a computer instructional program called ``Templates of
Doom,'' saying it violates a copyright on his Indiana Jones movies.
   Lucasfilm Inc. filed the suit Friday in U.S. District Court
against Solar Systems Software.
   Jones, a mythical archaeologist and adventurer played by Harrison
Ford, was the central character in Lucas' ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark'' and ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.'' ``Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade'' is due out in May, the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit said Lucasfilm has a trademark for the ``Temple of
Doom'' name and design, and used it to sell products like puzzles,
books, comics and video games.
   The ``Templates of Doom'' package pictures a character resembling
Jones wearing a snap-brim fedora, leather jacket and shoulder bag,
the suit said. The program teaches people how to use financial
spreadsheet programs, said Lucasfilm lawyer Neil Shapiro.
   The suit seeks $50,000 for alleged copyright infringements on
each Lucasfilm trademark product, plus damages equal to three times
the profits from the computer program, and a court order prohibiting
future infringements. It did not list the total number of alleged
infringements.
   Peter Antoniak of San Bruno, identified in the suit as owner of
Solar Systems, did not return a telephone call Monday.

   A model who is suing former New York Jets
defensive end Mark Gastineau for palimony says actress Brigitte
Nielsen, Gastineau's current partner, asked her to drop her claim.
   Jodee Dominici sued Gastineau on Nov. 3, claiming he broke
promises and lied to her during their three-year relationship.
   She said she was talking to the 32-year-old Gastineau on the
telephone earlier this year when Miss Nielsen, the ex-wife of actor
Sylvester Stallone, got on the line and said Ms. Dominici shouldn't
ask for money.
   ``She told me, `I didn't ask for anything from Stallone,''' Ms.
Dominici said.
   The advice attributed to Miss Nielsen would not be out of
character for the Danish actress, who ``did not ask for anything
from Mr. Stallone,'' according to publicist Joel Brokaw of Los
Angeles.
   Ms. Dominici's lawsuit says she gave up a modeling career and her
education for Gastineau, and seeks $480,000 in compensatory damages
and $200,000 in punitive damages. The 23-year-old Phoenix woman says
she met Gastineau in February 1985 and lived with him for three
years until January.

   Rolf Benirschke, former star place-kicker for
football's San Diego Chargers, will replace Pat Sajak as daytime
host of the game show ``Wheel of Fortune,'' NBC has announced.
   Benirschke will begin taping Wednesday pending completion of
contract details, the network said Monday. Benirschke's shows will
premiere Jan. 9.
   Sajak is giving up the daytime program to be host of a late-night
CBS talk show that debuts Jan. 9. He will continue to to be host of
the syndicated nighttime version of ``Wheel.''
   Benirschke, 33, who retired last year as the Chargers all-time
leading scorer, was one of 30 finalists for the ``Wheel'' job, said
officials for Merv Griffin Productions, the show's producer.
   Benirschke, who survived a serious digestive ailment while
playing with the Chargers, said Griffin saw him five months ago on a
Los Angeles talk show discussing his health problem and was
impressed with his demeanor and courage.
   ``I never thought this would happen,'' Benirschke said. ``People
had to convince me that I needed to consider this. It's a brand-new
part of my life and I'm looking forward to it.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 123.06 yen, up 0.14 yen from Monday's close
of 122.92 yen. After opening at 122.90 yen, the dollar ranged
between 122.89 yen and 123.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 121.13-point
loser the previous day, lost another 74.48 points, or 0.25 percent,
and finished trading at 29,597.81.
   Share prices, which inched down shortly after the market opened
following parallel trends on overseas markets, kept sinking toward
the end of the morning session.
   ``The index fell because the domestic interest rates became
higher as the dollar's uptrend began,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   He said a rise in Japanese interest rates affects market players
psychologically and dampens their buying interest. ``It's kind of a
formula in stock trading,'' he noted.
   Other dealers said most institutional investors were sitting on
the sidelines ahead of the release on Wednesday of U.S. trade
figures for October.
   On the foreign-exchange market, participants also were waiting
for the U.S. trade report, which could set the direction of currency
trading.

   Rescue workers in Soviet Armenia, like those
in Mexico City three years ago, are racing against time and the
elements to remove tons of rubble without killing people trapped
below.
   Using sound equipment, dogs, hammers and chisels, rescue crews
searched desperately for survivors for nearly three weeks after the
September 1985 earthquakes in Mexico City.
   After the first week, few were found alive, and they were mostly
babies. But the infants gave hope to a shattered city.
   Fighting infected wounds without water or food, they held out in
the tangled mass of concrete slabs, reinforcing rods and crushed
furniture of the hospitals where they were born.
   One baby, who was found on the ninth day after the Sept. 19
quake, is believed to be the last person rescued alive.
   Five days after the quake, amid fears that demolition of
seriously damaged buildings would begin, then-President Miguel de la
Madrid assured the country rescuers would go slowly.
   ``We have to work with prudence, so as not to put at risk the
volunteers, so the rescue work will not provoke internal cave-ins
that might cost the lives of those we might still be able to find
alive,'' he said.
   The government acknowledged 6,000 deaths, but estimates based on
reports from foreign rescue crews and private Mexican sources put
the toll as high as 30,000.
   Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were trapped alive after
the quake and a strong aftershock the next day that compacted the
rubble even more.
   Trained dogs sniffed for signs of life _ or death. Then rescuers,
demanding silence from waiting relatives and reporters, probed with
sensitive microphones, trying to home in on sounds and determine a
victim's exact location.
   Rescuers tunneled in with everything from drills to jackhammers,
blow torches, shovels and saws.
   Mexico City's mild climate worked in favor of those trapped, with
temperatures in the 70s during the day and the 50s at night.
Although downpours are common in September, it stayed dry in the
days after the quakes.
   For many victims in this city of 18 million, help came too late
anyway. For some, miracles unfolded.
   At what was the 12-story Juarez Hospital, near the bottom of a
100-foot-high pile of wreckage, a young medical intern lay face down
on top of one body and surrounded by others.
   The intern, Jose Juan Hernandez Cruz, heard rescuers reach other
victims and shouted for help and water. He twice heard crew leaders
give their men only half an hour to reach him or abandon the search,
saying many had died and one more didn't matter.
   Four days after the quake, they eased him out of a tunnel barely
big enough for his body.
   Six days after that, rescuers felt a last surge of hope when they
thought they heard sounds in the rubble of another building. They
searched for a week.
   No one was found.

   A man who murdered an immigrant Greek
restaurateur as his wife watched was put to death by injection early
Tuesday in an execution delayed when one of two intravenous needles
sprung a leak.
   Raymond Landry, 39, was pronounced dead at 12:45 a.m., hours
after the U.S. Supreme Court spared a second convicted murderer from
the same fate.
   Landry was the 29th person executed in Texas, more than any other
state, since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
   Prison officials began administering the lethal fluid at 12:21
a.m. Landry was not pronounced dead until 24 minutes later. In
between, a needle sprung a leak, sending the lethal mixture shooting
across the death chamber toward witnesses.
   ``There was something of a delay in the execution because of what
officials called a `blowout,''' said Charles Brown, spokesman for
the Texas Department of Corrections. ``The syringe came out of the
vein and the warden ordered the (execution) team to reinsert the
catheter into the vein.''
   After Landry was brought into the death chamber, he shook his
head briefly when asked by Warden Jack Pursleyif he had something to
say.
   At first, he showed no reaction to the drugs, and his lips
quivered.
   The leak occurred at 12:23 a.m. The needle on the inside of his
right arm leaked, sending the solution about two feet toward the
witnesses.
   Pursley quickly pulled a curtain across the viewing area to block
witnesses' views. For more than 14 minutes, witnesses heard the
sounds of doors opening and closing, some mumbling, and at least one
groan.
   The curtain was then reopened and Landry was motionless and
appeared dead with his eyes half closed.
   Three minutes later, two doctors arrived. They declared him dead
at 12:45 a.m.
   Brown said it was the first time such a problem had occurred in
Texas. In 1985 however, authorities repeatedly jabbed needles into
Stephen Morin when they had trouble finding a usable vein because he
had been a drug abuser.
   Landry was convicted in the death of Kosmas Prittis, who was
robbed and shot in the head while he and his family were closing
their Houston restaurant in 1982.
   Hours earlier, the Supreme Court blocked a second execution in
Texas, that of Samuel Hawkins, who was convicted of the 1976
rape-slaying of a 19-year-old woman. Had he been put to death along
with Landry, it would have been the first time since executions
resumed in 1976 that a state had put two people to death on the same
day.
   Landry's execution brings to 104 the number of men and women put
to death in the United States since 1976. The total includes 11
executions this year, three in Texas counting Landry.
   Thought it granted the stay for Hawkins, nation's high court
voted 7-2 earlier Monday to refuse the appeal filed by lawyers for
Landry. Landry's attorney, Michael Charlton, bypassed lower federal
courts and had appealed directly to the high court, while attorneys
for Hawkins were turned down by a federal appeals court in New
Orleans before going to the Supreme Court.
   U.S. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said the order
sparing Hawkins was entered at 10:25 p.m. Hours earlier, the court
had turned down Landry's appeal in a 7-2 vote.
   Hawkins, 45, was convicted in the death of Abbe Rogers Hamilton
of Borger, who was killed after Hawkins entered her apparently
unlocked home.
   Hawkins also has a second death sentence for the abduction and
slaying of a 12-year-old Amarillo girl. He has been dubbed the
``traveling rapist'' after admitting to some 40 rapes, prosecutors
said.
   Last January, Landry came within three hours of execution before
the Supreme Court issued a stay.
   In appeals for each inmate, defense attorneys cited a case
pending before the Supreme Court involving Texas death row inmate
Johnny Penry. That case challenges the legality of executing
mentally retarded inmates.
   ``This man isn't retarded,'' assistant attorney general Bob Walt
said of Landry. ``I don't think that's going to fly with the Supreme
Court.''
   Landry, an 11th-grade dropout, has a lengthy criminal record,
including arrests for sexual assault and abuse of a juvenile,
assault, family neglect and petty larceny.

   A worldwide outpouring of aid has

about 50 miles away. The sound of honking horns and grinding engines
breaks the mournful silence of stricken villages and cities.
   Foreign aircraft bringing in blood, medical supplies, food,
clothing and rescue equipment wait hours to be unloaded at the
airport in Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia.
   Two relief planes have crashed, killing more than 80 people, and
minor collisions have been reported among the throng of aircraft
that stacked up over the weekend.
   ``It's been unavoidably chaotic, with so many aircraft arriving
at once,'' said Colin Wheeler, an engineer with Air Europe, which
flew 20 tons of medical equipment and food into Yerevan on Monday.
   He said one of the airline's Boeing 707s was clipped by a taxiing
Aeroflot jet on Sunday but was not seriously damaged.
   Ground crews scurry among the mass of parked aircraft with the
few rolling stairways available.
   French and German teams who arrived with search dogs Saturday
said they had to wait an hour to get off their planes and four to
five hours for their donated cargo to be unloaded.
   Crates of supplies flown in by more than 40 foreign aircraft were
stacked around the airport tarmac waiting for trucks, buses and
helicopters to take them to stricken areas.
   Air traffic controllers spoke politely in broken English to
foreign air crews, then broke into heated shouting with fellow
Armenians, all taxed to the breaking point by overwork and personal
tragedy.
   ``Our nation is so undeveloped we can't even receive help
properly,'' lamented an exhausted dispatcher on the verge of tears.
She said she had been working for three days, relieved for only a
few hours to sleep in a nearby office while other exhausted workers
took her place.
   Refugees from the earthquake area cluster 10 deep around the
information desk of Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. The entire city
transport system has been commandeered to convey supplies to the
earthquake zone, and owners of private cars in the capital have been
patrolling the streets offering rides to the homeless packs seeking
refuge.
   At night, an eerie calm is enforced in Yerevan by dozens of army
tanks and armored personnel carriers patrolling areas that have been
the scene of ethnic protests for the past nine months.
   Last Wednesday's earthquake has demanded the attention of most
authorities, but Armenians campaigning for control of the contested
Nagorno-Karabakh region in neighboring Azerbaijan have continued to
demonstrate.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov confirmed at a
Moscow press conference on Monday that activists had been arrested
in Yerevan a day earlier.
   The undeveloped road system linking the capital with the north
and a spate of winter storms have further complicated relief efforts.
   The shorter of the two rutted mountain roads connecting Yerevan
and Spitak, which was nearly destroyed in the quake, was closed
Sunday and Monday by a heavy snowfall and a string of accidents.
   The sole route between Spitak and Leninakan, another city hit
hard, was closed to all but military vehicles to ease traffic jams
caused by the dispatch of heavy equipment and the arrival of fellow
Armenians seeking to help out.
   A cold spell prevented a major outbreak of disease by slowing the
growth of bacteria, but temperatures dropping below zero have
exacerbated hardships.
   Several hundred survivors remain in Spitak, where virtually every
home was destroyed. Forced to camp outside, they are searching for
relatives and trying to salvage belongings.
   As hope evaporates that any survivors will be found, those
standing vigil among the ruins of Spitak will move on to live with
relatives or take refuge in evacuation centers.
   ``What we haven't seen in these days!'' said Yasmina Akupyan, a
German-speaking Yerevan resident who has been shuttling between the
quake scene and the Armenian capital to translate for foreign
volunteers. ``If I had time to sleep, I wouldn't be able to.''

<HEAD>Atlantic City's Old-time Piers Are Fading Fast</HEAD>

   The fabulous piers of Atlantic City
are falling victim to fire, disrepair or commercialization. Gone are
the days when they featured big bands and ballrooms, aquariums,
church concerts and diving horses.
   When Steeplechase Pier burned down Saturday, the resort was left
with only four piers. Only one can be called commercially successful.
   The gaming halls that opened during the past 10 years are now
Atlantic City's main tourist attraction. But back in the late 1800s,
the resort's piers _with the soft, white-sandy beaches and ocean _
were the lure.
   The book ``So Young, So Gay,'' a collection of Atlantic City
historical facts, tells of numerous piers built and rebuilt since
1880, mostly for entertainment purposes such as concerts.
   ``Atlantic City doesn't seem to be a resort for piers anymore,''
said Atlantic County historian Adrian W. Phillips. ``I think the
temperament of Atlantic City has changed, and I just don't see the
piers coming back.''
   Saturday's fire at Steeplechase Pier caused more than $1 million
in damage, but shut down only a fast-food restaurant facing the
Boardwalk and a heliport. The pier, closed to the public in 1986,
was once know as ``the funny place'' for its variety of amusements
and theater acts.
   ``It had a variety of slides, rides and novelty features that
kept everybody entertained,'' Phillips recalled. ``It was famous for
that enormous Chesterfield cigarettes sign with thousands of
lights.''
   If the remnants of the pier are demolished as expected, four will
remain:
   _ Garden Pier holds the city's art and historical museums and a
small outdoor theater area. It is in need of repair, although plans
are under way to refurbish it, said Phillips.
   _ The old part of the famous Steel Pier overhanging the ocean is
being demolished, although owner Donald Trump has said he will
eventually rebuild and widen what remains as an extension of his
massive Taj Mahal casino project.
   _ Central Pier is now used mostly as a lucrative billboard
location and for storage, although souvenirs and arcade machines are
out front near the Boardwalk. A tower that once gave tourists a
bird's-eye view of the city is rapidly deteriorating.
   _ The burned out remains of the old Million Dollar Pier became
the Ocean One Mall in 1983, the only successful pier. It's designed
to look like an ocean liner, and attracts tourists bored with
gambling. It recently opened a small section with indoor amusement
rides.
   ``This is a shopping center where families can come to have a
good time,'' said Ocean One advertising manager Rita Similides.
``We're trying to emulate the old amusement piers as best we can.
Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's not, given the interesting
mix of people that now visit Atlantic City.''
   But Phillips said, ``In no way is Ocean One family entertainment,
nor does it parallel what Steel Pier or Steeplechase Pier used to
be. There's no variety of entertainment.''
   Besides Ocean One, at least one casino has tried to capture the
nostalgic image of the past _ but indoors. TropWorld Casino and
Entertainment Resort recently opened up ``Tivoli Pier,'' an indoor
amusement center with attractions and rides.
   Trump eventually will develop Steel Pier with a ``family
entertainment'' focus, said Stephen Hyde, chief executive of Trump's
casinos.
   ``The problem we would have in making it like the old-time piers
is the cost of maintaining everything just for a short summer
season,'' he said. ``If you bought a Ferris wheel at 1962 prices,
you wouldn't mind leaving it in the salt air, but at 1988 prices, it
doesn't make sense to use it only in the summer months.''

<HEAD>Former Manila Intelligence Chief Acquitted In Coup Plot Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A military court today acquitted the
man who was Manila's security chief under Ferdinand Marcos of
charges he plotted a 1987 coup attempt against President Corazon
Aquino.
   The government contended former Col. Rolando Abadilla sought
through the coup attempt to return Marcos to power. The acquittal
paves the way for him to assume duties as a provincial vice governor.
   Supporters of Abadilla cheered as the chairman of the six-member
court read the verdict, ending the trial that began in September.
   Abadilla had been charged along with several other officers of
mastermining the January 1987 takeover of television station GMA.
The government said the takeover was part of a bid to reinstate
Marcos, who was ousted in February 1986 in a popular uprising and
lives in Hawaiian exile.
   Mutinous troops holding the station surrendered about 60 hours
later, and Abadilla went into hiding. He was arrested in a Manila
suburb in July 1987 and was charged with several other offenses,
including illegal weapons possession.
   But all other charges had been dismissed before today's ruling.
   Abadilla served as security and intelligence chief of the Manila
area under the Marcos administration. Human rights groups have cited
him as a chief human rights offender under Marcos, though he has
never been convicted of any crime.
   In January, Abadilla was elected vice governor of Ilocos Norte,
Marcos' home province, but has remained in detention in Manila
pending the outcome of his legal cases. His wife campaigned for him
during the balloting.
   Last May, 11 people were convicted of mutiny in connection with
the television station takeover and sentenced to 12 years at hard
labor. Ninety-five others were convicted and sentenced to shorter
terms and one was acquitted.
   Several other alleged ringleaders remain at large, including a
former superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy.
   Abadilla also took part in the July 1986 takeover of The Manila
Hotel, in which dissident officers attempted to install former Sen.
Arturo Tolentino as president.
   Tolentino was Marcos' running-mate in the disputed 1986 election
against Mrs. Aquino. The mutineers abandoned the hotel after failing
to win broad support, but they were not seriously punished.
   Abadilla was also charged with mastermining an April 1987 raid on
the stockade at Manila's Fort Bonifacio, a failed bid to free
mutineers jailed in the television station takeover.
   He was also accused of plotting to seize Villamor Air Base, next
to Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as part of a planned
coup attempt in June 1987.
   However, charges in the Fort Bonifacio and Villamor plots were
dropped earlier this year.

   East Germany's ambassador to the United
States came to the Midwest seeking the child's view of peace on
Earth, and that's what he got.
   ``It would feel kind of like a storm on an ocean that's really
rough, and in the morning, it's all peaceful and calm and quiet,''
said 10-year-old Megan Fornelli, one of the 15 youngsters at a
meeting with Ambassador Gerhard Herder. ``A way to be peaceful is to
stop being selfish, because a lot of times wars are started because
one country wanted something and another country wanted something.''
   Herder participated in the conference Monday at the Montessori
Children's House west of St. Louis. He also delivered a letter from
Erich Honecker, the German Democratic Republic's leader, videotapes
created by children in East Germany, and a book about the socialist
country.
   The discussion of peace began with a question from one of the
moderators _ 9-year-old Ben Rondot.
   ``If you have peace inside of you, what does it feel like, look
like and sound like?'' he asked.
   Seven-year-old Ben Oberkfell had an answer.
   ``Peace is like a light that shines like a candle in someone's
heart,'' the youngster said.
   Having peace inside you is like ``floating on a cloud, playing
with friends,'' said Trisha Guenther, 7.
   Herder was struck by the childrens' simple eloquence.
   ``I feel very quiet and relaxed,'' he said. ``I feel happy
because I am in the company of good friends I like so much, and in
this circumstance I feel the importance of peace.''
   Herder's visit and gifts were in response to a letter written to
Honecker by 7-year-old Brett Fornelli, Megan's brother and a
participant in a project called Kids for Peace. The project began
last spring when 170 children from the St. Louis area wrote letters
to leaders around the world. The children wrote to promote world
peace and to request that kids everywhere share video programs to
promote the cause.
   The first set of letters was mailed in May. Since then, the
children have received responses from educators, television stations
and government officials from around the world.
   But the response from East Germany produced the first
face-to-face meeting.
   Herder told the children that a world at peace would mean no more
wars. People would work to understand and help each other.
   ``Everybody would be happy,'' Herder said. ``Everybody would help
each other to maintain a happy life. That would be global peace on
earth. This is what I'm working for.''
   He urged the children to continue working toward peace all their
lives.
   ``Unity and hard work for peace, that is the message I would send
to all children,'' he said. ``Our strength is friendship, our
strength is unity, our strength is cooperation. And you children,
you are our future.''

   Five men rescued after their 150-foot boat caught
fire last week 800 miles northeast of Hawaii have been arrested for
marijuana trafficking, authorities said.
   The five are accused of attempting to scuttle the fishing vessel,
the Iho Maru No. 23, by setting off explosives when the Coast Guard
cutter Jarvis confronted the boat Wednesday, Coast Guard Lt. j.g.
Brad Nelson said Monday.
   The fire, which continued to smolder late Monday, has prevented
authorities from searching the ship's cargo hold, said Coast Guard
spokesman Keith Spangler. A large quanity ot Thai stick marijuana is
believed in the hold, he said.
   The damaged vessel, listing 15 degrees, is under tow by the
Jarvis and is expected to reach Honolulu on Friday or Saturday,
Spangler said.
   Five men from are in custody aboard the Jarvis and will be
arraigned on maritime marijuana trafficking charges when they reach
Honolulu, federal authorities said.
   The fishing vessel's master was identified as Paul Arthur
Greyshock, 35, of Keaau, Hawaii. Crewmembers were identified as Mike
Stewart, 46, and Larry Landis, 45, of Keaau; Scott Davidson, 31, of
Kailua-Kona, and Christopher William Mussell, 38, believed to be
from New Zealand.
   Greyshock has been under investigation for several years,
officials of the FBI, Coast Guard, Customs Service and the U.S.
attorney's office said in a joint statement.
   He came under closer scrutiny after about $50,000 of undeclared
cash was seized from him at the Honolulu International Airport in
August after he arrived from Tahiti, officials said.

<HEAD>Gannett and Two Other Firms Accused of Billboard Price Fixing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Gannett Co. Inc. and two other
outdoor advertising firms conspired to fix prices for Southern
California billboard space, a federal grand jury has charged.
   A spokeswoman for Gannett, which runs North America's largest
outdoor advertising company, said the charges were baseless and
would be ``contested vigorously.''
   The monopoly was run by Gannett Outdoor of Southern California
and former chairman and chief executive officer Hal Brown;
Metromedia Inc. of Secaucus, N.J., and former vice president Michael
F. Tobey; and Foster and Kleiser Corp. of Delaware, said Judy
Whalley, of the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.
   The defendants were charged with suppressing competition in
violation of antitrust laws, Ms. Whalley, acting assistant attorney
general in charge of the department's antitrust division, said
Monday.
   If convicted, the firms could be fined $1 million and the men
could be sentenced to three years in prison and fined $100,000 each.
   ``The charges will be carefully studied, but Gannett believes
they are wrong and are based on a misunderstanding of the facts and
the law,'' spokeswoman Mimi Feller said in a statement.
   ``We believe these charges are without merit,'' said Arnold L.
Wadler, vice president and general counsel for Metromedia Inc., a
privately held telecommunications and technology company of which
Foster and Kleiser is an affliate.
   The allegations focus on a period before Gannett Co. Inc.
acquired Pacific Outdoor Advertising through a merger with Combined
Communications Corp. in 1979, turning it into Gannett Outdoor, Ms.
Feller said.
   The nationwide media company publishes 88 daily newspapers,
including USA Today, the Gannett News Services and USA Weekend
magazine. It also operates 10 TV stations and 16 radio stations, she
said.

   Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a
one-time aide to former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger held
hostage in Lebanon, will make his family and country proud
regardless of his fate, his uncle says.
   ``He loves his country,'' Delbert Eagle of Lancaster said after
Higgins was abducted Feb. 17. ``He is capable of standing up as well
as an ordinary man will under the circumstances. ... I don't think
they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his
country in any way.
   ``I think he would die first.''
   On Monday, Lebanese kidnappers holding the 43-year-old Higgins
said in a statement they have sentenced him to death as a spy for
Israel.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement signed by the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   But the statement did not mention an execution date.
   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher of Louisville, said she had no
knowledge of the threat other than what she has heard from reporters.
   ``I have not been contacted by anyone,'' she said Monday.
   When he was abducted, Higgins headed a 75-member observer group
assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   A Pentagon official said at the time that Higgins was on
temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization's Lebanon Observer Group.
   The group monitors cease-fire violations on the Lebanon-Israel
border. Higgins was the top-ranking American officer assigned to the
group, holding the title of senior U.S. military observer.
   By the time Higgins left for college, he was well on the way to
fulfilling the ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook: ``For
my family to always be proud of me.''
   When he was growing up in southern Jefferson County in the late
1950s and early 1960s, his friends never expected the chunky,
cheerful youngster to make his career in the military.
   ``He was just pretty much an average guy at Southern High
School,'' Rudy Fischer, an old friend, recalled after Higgins'
abduction.
   ``I think people were kind of surprised when he went into the
Marines,'' Fischer added. ``You think of the Marines as being macho
types, and he really wasn't like that.''
   Even so, Higgins won appointment to West Point, but chose instead
to study at Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship.
   He opted for the Marines after suffering seasickness during a
summer cruise to Scandinavia, his brother-in-law, Harold Fischer,
recalled.
   Others who knew Higgins in Louisville remember him as a bright,
well-rounded young man who stood out in school and on the athletic
field.
   Higgins, whose friends knew him as ``Rich'' or ``Pinky,'' earned
mostly A's and B's. He played guard on his high school football team
in 1962 and 1963.
   ``He gave us 100 percent effort,'' said Henderson Wilson, then
the team's line coach.
   Higgins was president of his sophomore class, vice president of
his senior class and won membership in the Beta Club and Key Club,
according to his senior yearbook.
   His fellow seniors and teachers voted him one of the top 10
members of the class of 1963, based on scholarship, leadership,
school spirit and personality, said Assistant Principal Ralph Allen.
   He was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated from
Miami University, and later earned master's degrees in human
resources management at Pepperdine University and political science
at Auburn University.
   Higgins was born in Danville, and lived in Lancaster, Covington
and Louisville. He and his first wife, the former Bonita Spalding of
Louisville, have a 17-year-old daughter, Christine Lynn. He has
another sister, Linda Lee Miller, of Memphis, Tenn.
   Higgins' second wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, works at the
Pentagon.
   Both of his parents have died _ his mother, Mary Ethel Higgins,
in 1979, and his father, William F. Higgins, shortly after his
abduction.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities have fallen to their lowest levels this month.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills on
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.98 percent, down from 8.04
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.21 percent, down from 8.25 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.97
percent on Nov. 21 and six-month bills averaged 8.13 on Nov. 28.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.26 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,798.30, and and 8.69 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,584.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.89
percent last week after averaging 8.75 percent the week before.

<TEXT>
   When retired TWA pilot Dennis Maloney
picked up a newspaper, he thought he might see a reference to a
hijacking that occurred 20 years ago.
   Instead, Monday's headline, ``TWA flight to Miami is hijacked,''
carried him back to Dec. 11, 1968, when he was the captain of
another Miami-bound TWA flight that was hijacked.
   The two piracies took place 20 years apart almost to the hour.
Both planes were Boeing 727s and the flight numbers contained the
same digits, Maloney said. His was Flight 496, Sunday's was Flight
469.
   ``I couldn't believe it. The same date, the same time, the same
type of aircraft,'' said Maloney of suburban Prairie Village, Kan.,
who retired 18 months ago after 23 years with TWA. ``I bet the
chances aren't 10 million to one of that happening.''
   Sunday's hijacking, only the second involving a domestic U.S.
airliner in 2{ years, never made it to Cuba, the intended
destination of the Cuban exile who claimed to have a bomb,
authorities said. The flight instead went to Grand Turk, part of the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas,
where the man was in custody pending extradition proceedings.
   Maloney's flight, which originated in Kansas City and stopped in
St. Louis, left Nashville for Miami when it was hijacked to Havana.
It was the 19th U.S. commercial airliner forced to Cuba in 1968's
wave of hijackings.
   Stories from 20 years ago described Maloney's hijacker as a
supercool gunman with a smiling female companion who appeared to be
about six months pregnant. Among the 32 passengers and crew of seven
were country singer Tex Ritter, father of actor John Ritter, and pro
golfer Mason Rudolph.
   Maloney, 54, recalled there was early speculation the gunman
might have been Eldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther Party activist
who had disappeared in November 1968 to avoid arrest for violating
parole.
   But after being shown pictures of Cleaver, Maloney and others
said he was not the hijacker. The gunman later was identified as a
man named Patterson, a Black Panther who eventually ended up in
Algeria, Maloney said.
   Maloney said the hijacker grabbed a cabin attendant, forced his
way into the cockpit and ordered the crew to fly to Cuba at gunpoint.
   When the plane landed in Havana, between 200 and 300 Cuban
soldiers surrounded the plane, Maloney said. The hijacker and his
companion were taken off, he was disarmed, and they were marched
away, he said.
   A diplomat from the Swiss embassy arrived and interrogated the
crew and passengers, who were taken to a restaurant and fed before
the passengers were taken to another airport and flown back to the
United States.
   Maloney and his crew flew out of Havana to Miami that evening.
   ``We all lived through it,'' Maloney said. ``There was no
problem, other than the delay. The next morning, I kiddingly said to
one of the administrative guys at TWA, `I promised the crew a week
off with pay.' He said, `I hope you've got enough money to pay for
it out of your own pocket.'''
   Later, as the number of hijackings continued to grow, it became a
policy to allow crews paid leave after an incident, Maloney said.

   Much of the East today remained in the icy grip of arctic air
that brought record low temperatures, while chinook winds howled
through the Rockies.
   Temperatures dropped below zero in eastern New York state and
northern New England but the cold was less intense and widespread
than during Sunday night and Monday morning.
   Albany, N.Y., set a record for today's date when the mercury
plunged to 5 below zero, breaking the 1960 record of minus 1.
Shortly before midnight, Baltimore tied its record for Dec. 12 at 10
degrees and Newark, N.J., broke its 1960 record of 9 with a 6-degree
reading.
   The nation's high temperature Monday was 88 degrees at San
Gabriel, Calif.
   Light snow fell ahead of a cold front moving through the Great
Lakes region. Up to 3 inches covered several areas in Wisconsin, and
northern Illinois received an inch or less.
   The snow spread eastward into northeast Indiana, Ohio, and parts
of Kentucky and Michigan. Strong, gusty winds accompanied the snow,
reducing visibilities. The snow was expected to move into western
Pennsylvania this morning.
   A developing area of low pressure off Florida's east coast
produced sleet and snow along coastal areas of North Carolina.
   Windy conditions developed in the northern Rockies ahead of a
cold front moving across the Pacific Northwest. Livingston, Mont.,
recorded a gust of 58 mph Monday evening. A high wind warning
remained in effect this morning for the east slopes of the Rockies
and the upper Yellowstone Valley in Montana.
   The chinooks _ or winds that blow down the eastern slopes of the
Rockies _were expected to spread southward into the central Rockies
today.
   The cold front over the Pacific Northwest produced rain along the
northern Pacific coast and snow in the Cascade mountains. A snow
advisory was in effect today for the Cascades of Washington state.
   Today's forecast called for snowshowers from western New England
and the mid-Atlantic coast to the lower Great Lakes and much of
Michigan; rain from western North Dakota across Montana, and the
northern Pacific coast, with rain becoming snow in the higher
elevations.
   Predicted highs: teens in northern Maine, 20s and 30s from the
rest of New England across the mid-Atlantic coast, the northern
Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the upper
Mississippi Valley and eastern North Dakota; 40s and 50s from North
Carolina across northern Florida, the central Gulf of Mexico states,
the Tennessee Valley, the central Mississippi Valley, the northern
Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies and the northern
Pacific coast; 70s in southern Florida, southern Texas, and from
southern Arizona across Southern California.
   The rest of the nation should generally reach the 60s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8 degrees
below zero at Glens Falls, N.Y., to 73 at Key West, Fla.

   Dozens of homeless people have erected a
subterranean cardboard city in a downtown subway station, using
about 50 old refrigerator cartons to shelter them from the numbing
cold.
   Terry Ryan said he doesn't care that the potted flowers in front
of his box are dead from the cold.
   ``At least I'm warm,'' he said Monday.
   Ryan is one of an estimated 10,000 homeless people in
Philadelphia. About 50 have been sleeping in cardboard refrigerator
boxes in the dank station below the ornate Academy of Music, home of
the Philadelphia Orchestra.
   The structures at the Walnut-Locust Station of the Broad Street
Subway began going up about Thanksgiving. Although homeless people
often congregated in subway stations in previous years, this is the
first year such a vast conglomeration of cardboard shelters has been
erected.
   Ryan, 19, is proud of his particularly large living quarters. He
has used wire and two metal poles to combine several smaller boxes
into a 7-by-14-foot shelter and tacked up plastic sheets to cut down
drafts. With this much room, Ryan invited three other men and one
woman to live with him.
   ``These are my people,'' he said. ``We help out each other.
Everybody down here are protective of each other.''
   Plunging temperatures _ it was just 13 degrees here early today _
have added urgency to the plight of the homeless. In recent days,
the city has sent out teams of social workers, police and former
homeless people to encourage the homeless to enter shelters.
   But one of Ryan's roommates, Miguel Rodriguez, said he feels
safer in his cardboard home.
   Rodriguez, 18, said he had lived in a series of homes and
shelters for 13 years since his family moved to New York City and
abandoned him.
   ``I'd never go back to a shelter,'' he said. ``They steal your
things.'' Clothing is taken most often in the shelters, he said, but
added, ``People will take anything they can.''
   Rodriguez had been living under a bridge until he came
underground to escape the cold several weeks ago. He said he has
been homeless about five months but plans to enter a job program in
January.
   ``I want to learn the culinary arts,'' he said.
   Lisa Culpepper, Rodriguez's 19-year-old girlfriend, also lives in
the box. ``We met awhile back, then met up again down here,''
Rodriguez said.
   Danny, the newest roommmate, had been in a home with Rodriguez as
a child and met up with him again about a week ago.
   Unlike Ryan, who was wearing a trenchcoat, and Rodriguez, who
sported a Notre Dame jacket, Danny had on only a dress shirt and
sweat pants Monday night. The 18-year-old, who declined to give his
last name, said he leaves the box as rarely as possible, ``because
it's cold even down here.''
   The men said they are comfortable with their shelter. ``There's
no rats or anything,'' Rodriguez said, ``And most of the others are
older people so no one bothers us.''
   Even so, the nearest public toilet is four blocks away, he said.
   ``Most of the older people can't make it that far, so they just
go on themselves,'' he said. ``That makes the place stink.''
   One city doctor has been pushing for a portable toilet to be
placed in the station. Dr. Miguel A. Cortes, a contract physician
with the city's Department of Public Health, is one of several
doctors who stop in the station each night to check on the health of
the people staying there.
   ``They desperately need a toilet down here,'' he said. ``They've
already got running water,'' he said, pointing to a spigot against
the wall, ``Now if we can only find someone who'll donate one for
us.''
   Cortes said many of the older people urinate in their pants,
``then they get the chills and pneumonia.''
   Mycoplasma pneumonia and malnutrition are the all-too common
ailments of the subway occupants, he said. ``The chronic lung
infections are from breathing the vapors from the subway vents,'' he
said.
   Ryan said Cortes got penicillin for him when he was sick a few
weeks ago. ``He's trying to help me get into the community
college,'' Ryan said.
   Then he turned to Rodriguez. ``Man, if I get out of here, I'm
going to leave my home to you,'' Ryan said. ``I'm not going to
abandon my friends.''

<TEXT>
   The international stage hit ``Les Miserables''
will be made into a movie, with Alan Parker set to direct, Tri-Star
Pictures announced.
   ``I want to forget the play and start again, yet I'm totally
impressed and inspired by it,'' said Parker, who directed the
current movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' ``The beauty of the musical
score is that it tells the story quite clearly.''
   The play is based on Victor Hugo's classic novel about social
injustice in Revolutionary France.
   ``We're looking to Alan Parker to find a completely cinematic
approach to the material,'' said Cameron Mackintosh, producer of the
stage production. ``What is on stage couldn't possibly put on screen
as it is. I'm sure Alan will reinterpret it, but the basic premise
and music will stay.''
   There are 13 various productions of ``Les Miserables'' worldwide,
with 12 scheduled to open in the next 18 months. Having just debuted
in Florida, the play will open in Toronto in March, followed by
openings in Poland, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Paris, Amsterdam,
Stockholm, Mexico, Spain and Turkey.
   Robert Colesberry, who produced ``Mississippi Burning,'' will
serve as producer on the movie. ``Les Miserables'' is expected to go
before the cameras in early 1991, with filming tentatively set in
Europe. No casting decisions have been made, Parker said.

<HEAD>Iran Reported To Have Received 50 Combat Jets From China</HEAD>

   Iran received the final delivery of 50
fighter jets from China before the Aug. 20 cease-fire in its war
with Iraq, well-informed diplomatic sources reported today.
   The J-6 and F-7 jets, Chinese versions of the Soviet-built MiG-19
and MiG-21, were delivered by ship over three years in knocked-down
form through Iran's Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas, a key naval
and air base, and assembled in Iran, the sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese
jets, along with a large quantity of air-to-air missiles, were
allocated to the Revolutionary Guards' air wing, not the regular air
force.
   Western military officials could not confirm the delivery. But
Don Kerr, an aviation specialist with the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies said the jets had been expected
``for some time''.
   ``The quantity and the timing are certainly right for the
Iranians in their effort to develop weapons systems from other
sources to get around their very serious problems of supply for
their U.S.-built equipment,'' Kerr said in a telephone interview.
   China is Iran's major arms supplier and has provided Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's regime with anti-ship Silkworm missiles and a
squadron of 10 J-6s in 1985 for training purposes.
   Iran's military collapsed in a series of Iraqi victories before
the United Nations-sponsored cease-fire took effect and it is
seeking to rebuild its forces.
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies reported last
year that Iran signed a $1.6 billion deal with Beijing in 1985 for
combat aircraft, tanks and artillery.
   Mednews, a Paris-based newsletter specializing in Middle East
defense issues, reported Nov. 21 that the deal involved what it
identified as 60 F-7 and F-7M jets, each costing more than $6
million, between July 1985 and February 1987.
   However, the diplomatic sources reported that final deliveries
were delayed until earlier this year.
   Mednews, quoting what it said was a copy of the contract between
the Chinese and the Iranians, said Beijing also agreed to supply 500
PL-2 and 2,000 PL-2A air-to-air-missiles, modeled on the U.S.
Sidewinder missile.
   Also in the deal were 1,000 PL-7 air-to-air missiles, copied from
the French R-550 Matra weapon, and 72,500 57mm air-to-ground
rockets, Mednews said.
   The Chinese also contracted to provide spare engines and
technical backup with aircrews and ground crews to train Iranians,
Mednews reported.
   China has denied it sells arms to Iran or Iraq, although the
Institute for Strategic Studies lists J-6 fighters in Iraq's air
force inventory.
   The delivery of the jets virtually doubled the size of Iran's
badly depleted air strength. But none of the Chinese fighters was
ever reported in combat, even when the Iranians were suffering
military defeats between April and July.
   ``It takes three years to get personnel trained and operational
on new aircraft,'' Kerr said. ``So it's not surprising the F-7s were
not committed in the fighting earlier this year, even when the
Iranians had their backs to the wall.
   ``The personnel flying these planes would still have been very
inexperienced.
   The Iranian air force was built around U.S.-supplied F-4
Phantoms, F-5 Tigers and F-14 Tomcats delivered before Khomeini's
Islamic revolution toppled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   Before the Iran-Iraq war erupted in September 1980, the Iranian
air force had 447 combat aircraft.
   But because of a chronic lack of spares, mainly due to a U.S.
arms embargo, and combat losses, Western analysts estimate the
Iranians now only have around 50 operational U.S.-made warplanes,
some without working radars.
   Iraq's air force, equipped mainly with Soviet and French
aircraft, outnumbers the Iranians by at least 6 to 1.

<TEXT>
   A landlord's policy of monthly fees for
things like sitting on the front porch or having a freezer has
angered residents of a low-income housing development.
   The price of lounging on a porch or sitting on a stoop at the
Winter Green Apartments is $25. Three violations are grounds for
eviction. Landlord Eric B. Allen of Greater Hartford Realty says the
policy was implemented earlier this year to reduce drug traffic, and
is working.
   Allen, whose company began managing the apartments in May, also
charges residents a variety of monthly fees, including for having
freezers ($9), clothes dryers ($9), and air conditioners ($12).
   The porch-sitting policy is an apparent violation of federal
housing rules because it has not been approved by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the federally
subsidized apartments, an official said.
   Residents in the 32-building, 160-unit complex are upset about
the policy. A meeting on the topic last month developed into a
shouting match between tenants and property managers.
   ``It's just ridiculous,'' said Albert J. Farmer, who has lived at
Winter Green for 13 years.
   The 73-year-old Farmer, whose left leg is amputated below the
knee, is targeted for eviction because he has not paid the $9 fee
for a freezer.
   ``I respect him, but I have to treat him like anyone else,''
Allen said.
   Farmer plans to fight eviction.
   ``He's acting like a dictator,'' Farmer said. ``He has people
afraid of him. But I'm not going anywhere.''
   Allen said the fines are helping to improve the property: keeping
people off the porches has reduced drug trafficking.
   ``The idea of imposing fines has changed things,'' he said. ``We
don't have the problems we used to have.''
   Allen said he won't consider relaxing the policy.
   ``We haven't won. The dope dealers are standing by waiting for us
to move out.''
   Robert Donovan, housing management director for the HUD in
Hartford, said the porch-sitting policy apparently violates federal
housing rules.
   ``To assess additional charges, they have to ask us for
permission,'' he said. ``They never asked us for authorization for a
fee for loitering on a porch.''
   Donovan said Greater Hartford Realty has received approval from
HUD to levy other monthly charges in addition to rent. Most cover
the electricity used by heavy appliances.

<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker has breached
lower-level security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for
the 11th time in a week, officials said.
   The latest intrusion into the system took place Saturday, the lab
announced Monday.
   So far, the hacker has managed to invade the unclassified
research computer systems at the lab at least 11 times during the
past week.
   There have been no new intrusions since the weekend, Chuck Cole,
chief of the nuclear weapons facility, said through a spokesman.
   The spokesman, Ronald Teunis, said Cole could not comment
directly because he was ``exhausted'' from the hectic weeklong
invasion of the computer systems by the mysterious hacker.
   Cole had issued a public invitation to the hacker or hackers last
Saturday, asking to be contacted directly ``so I can see what he
wants.''
   Teunis said Cole has received several telephone calls from people
offering to help, but none was believed to be the hacker.
   He said the system involved is the UNIX network, which links
research labs and universities around the nation. The network, used
for unclassified scientific research, was the one invaded last month
by a computer virus believed released by a Cornell University
graduate student.
   The Livermore hacker has not invaded the lab's highly secret
nuclear weapons research computers, which are physically and
electronically separated from the unclassified system.
   Teunis said the hacker has not destroyed or altered any
information in the files, although the hacker apparently has the
capability of doing so.
   Cole emphasized earlier that the attacks do not involve a virus,
a program that invades a computer system and can clog its memory
system by overreproduction.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's rulers have since July killed at least 300
opposition activists in the country's largest wave of political
executions since the early 1980s, Amnesty International charged
today.
   Evidence of the mass executions is indisputable and the true
death toll could be in the thousands, the London-based human rights
organization said.
   Opposition activists have been killed secretly in prisons
throughout Iran, including Evin and Gohardasht in Tehran and others
in Tabriz, Mashhad and Shiraz, Amnesty said.
   Iranian authorities initially denied reports of mass hangings and
shootings, but Amnesty said the reports were confirmed in effect by
public statements in recent days by Iranian officials including
President Sayed Ali Khamenei.
   Among those executed were people either kept in prison after
serving their sentences or re-arrested after release, Amnesty said.
It added that many of those executed had been tortured.
   Most victims were leftists, the majority members of the People's
Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, the statement said. It said some
were from Rahe Kargar, the People's Fedayeen Organization, the
communist Tudeh Party or Kurdish opposition groups.
   Both men and women were executed, ranging from students to
doctors and clergymen suspected of supporting Ayatollah Montazeri,
designated successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary patriarch, Amnesty said.
   It cited many sources of evidence, including relatives of
executed prisoners and recent statements by authorities. The
organization said it had information, all of it cross-checked, on
more than 300 executions since July but believed the real number
could be in the thousands.
   ``Nobody really knows how many people have been put to death,
just as nobody knows when the killing will stop or who will be next
to die,'' it said.
   ``Our fears are heightened because thousands of political
prisoners are still held in Iran and because many of those executed
recently had been imprisoned without trial or were serving long
prison sentences imposed after unfair trials.''
   Amnesty said a Tehran woman who gave evidence had searched
secretly for her husband's body in Jadeh Khavaran cemetery in August.
   ``Groups of bodies ... had been buried in unmarked shallow graves
in the section of the cemetery reserved for executed leftist
political prisoners,'' it quoted her as saying.
   Her husband, a Communist imprisoned under the late Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, was arrested again in 1985. Amnesty said he was
tortured over several months and convicted at a summary trial during
which he was barely conscious.
   Khomeini's Islamic revolution overthrew the shah in February 1979.
   The statement said the man's wife arrived at Evin prison in early
August to visit him and was told he had been moved.
   Officials at the cemetery confirmed he had been executed but
would not say where he was buried. The woman had to stop digging
because of patrols by guards but relatives later found the grave,
Amnesty said.
   ``Once I knew where he was I could leave,'' it quoted the woman
as saying. She now is outside Iran but prefers to anonymous for fear
of reprisals against her family, the statement said.
   Other prisoners secretly executed included high school students
arrested in the early 1980s for distributing political leaflets or
disrupting political rallies, Amnesty said. Some of them were kept
in jail after serving six-month sentences, it declared.
   One former student was held without charge or trial since his
arrest in 1982 at age 16, the statement said, and a 17-year-old
arrested in 1981 was sentenced to 11 years for supporting the
People's Mujahedeen.
   Amnesty expressed concern about what it calls lack of provision
for fair trials of Iranian political prisoners and the absence of a
right to appeal death sentences. It opposes the death penalty, which
it considers a violation of the rights to life and freedom from
cruel treatment or punishment.

<TEXT>
   A poll shows fewer Americans admit to
drinking and driving today than three years ago and the National
Safety Council is attributing part of the decrease to a fear of
getting caught.
   From 1985 to 1988, the percentage of Americans who said they
drove after consuming alcohol fell from 37 percent to 28 percent,
according to the poll conducted by the Roper Organization for the
All-Industry Research Advisory Council.
   ``What we're seeing is that the state laws are having some
effect,'' said David Unnewehr, research manager of the council,
based here west of Chicago.
   ``Of those who said they are drinking and driving less, 36
percent said it was because of awareness of tougher laws and
fines.'' Unnewehr said Monday.
   His group was established by the insurance industry to do
research in policy areas affecting risk and insurance.
   Al Lauersdorf, alcohol programs administrator for the National
Safety Council, said: ``The perception is there that their chances
of being caught are greater, and that's contributing to a decrease.''
   As a result, greater numbers of people either do not drink when
they are planning to drive or make other arrangements for
transportation, he said.
   ``The designated driver concept, where one person drinks soda or
coffee or nothing, has taken root across the country, especially
where mass transit is not an option,'' said Lauersdorf.
   ``The increase of the drinking age to 21 throughout the country
has cut a lot of drinking by younger people.''
   Drivers between ages 18 and 34, a group more likely to drink and
drive, were mostly responsible for the decline, Unnewehr said.
   The percentage of people from 18 to 24 drinking and driving
dropped from 48 percent in 1985 to 31 percent in 1988, the poll
showed. Among those 25 to 29 the number went from 53 percent in 1985
to 39 percent this year.
   For those ages 30 to 34, the percentage who said they drink and
drive decreased from 51 percent to 33 percent.
   The poll showed that 37 percent of men and 20 percent of women
said they drove after drinking. In 1985, the figures were 45 percent
for men and 29 percent for women.
   In the Midwest, 33 percent said they drove after drinking
compared with 32 percent in the Northeast, 30 percent in the West
and 21 percent in the South.
   The research council commissioned similar studies in 1985 and
1986. This year's telephone survey of 1,499 people around the
country was conducted from June 4-18 and has an error margin of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.

   A 250-foot Indian merchant ship steamed toward
port for repairs today after being accidentally hit by a supersonic
``Harpoon'' missile fired from a U.S. Navy jet, killing one crewman,
authorities said.
   The body of the merchant seaman was flown by a Navy helicopter to
Wilcox Memorial Hospital on the island of Kauai, nursing supervisor
Lillian Teshima.
   The Indian vessel Jagvivek, bound for Singapore with an unknown
cargo, was in Navy's Pacific Missile Range 200 miles northwest of
Honolulu, even though the area was closed to commercial shipping
because of military operations, the Navy said.
   Navy authorities are investigating the incident.
   In New Delhi, the Indian government declined comment.
   The FA-18 Hornet attack fighter from the aircraft carrier USS
Constellation launched the 12-foot-long, 1,000-pound, unarmed
missile during a training mission toward a target hulk ship many
miles out to sea, the Navy said.
   ``Unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough to
the path of the merchant vessel for the missile's seeker to guide on
it instead of the original target,'' the Navy said in a statement.
   The impact of the nonexplosive missile into the ship's structure
above the main deck killed the crewman and collapsed part of the
structure, the Navy said.
   Two Navy ships were sent to assist the Jagvivek and a Navy doctor
and a medical corpsman went aboard. They pronounced the crewman dead
at the scene, the Navy said.
   Ms. Teshima did not disclose the type of injuries he suffered.
His name was not released.
   The Constellation and seven other ships in its battle group were
conducting training exercises en route to a Western Pacific
deployment, the Navy said.
   The thousands of square miles of ocean that make up the Pacific
Missile Range frequently are closed to civilian craft with
advisories broadcast at set times each day on marine radio
frequencies, according to the Coast Guard.
   Accidents involving civilian vessels in the training area are
rare, but not unprecedented.
   In May 1975, two jets from the aircraft carrier USS Kittyhawk
dropped several 20-pound practice bombs, just missing a 20-foot
cabin cruiser that the pilots apparently mistook for a target craft,
according to newspaper files.
   Navy officials in that case said the boat's skipper had ignored
warnings to stay out of the restricted area.

   When last seen, a wandering wallaby that
escaped from its pen was hopping toward the business district of
this suburban Chicago community.
   ``I almost came to a complete stop as it hopped by my car like he
knew what he was doing,'' said resident John Lyons.
   Apparently it took a detour, since police say the reports on
Sunday were the last they've heard of the wallaby, a kangaroo
relative, that escaped from its owner, Paul Marchetti.
   Marchetti, who keeps four of the marsupials on his farm southwest
of Chicago, said the animal escaped from its pen.
   ``If it was chased it will not find its way back,'' Marchetti
said.
   The errant wallaby, which does not have a name, is female, 3-feet
tall, with brown and white fur.
   Marchetti said the wallaby is not dangerous to those who come
near her, but she may be difficult to catch.
   ``They're not cuddly animals; they're aloof,'' he said. ``It
would not come up to you like a dog would.''
   He said the animal can survive the cold but it might not find
food. He feeds it guinea pig chow.

<HEAD>Mobster Provenzano Dies While Serving Racketeering Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMPOC, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobster Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano,
the man former Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa was on his way to meet
when he vanished, has died of a heart attack while serving a federal
racketeering sentence.
   Provenzano died at Lompoc District Hospital, near the federal
prison where he was serving a 20-year term for two racketeering
conspiracy offenses, prison spokesman Chuck LaRoe said.
   The 71-year-old former New Jersey union boss had been confined to
the hospital in Lompoc, 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles, for
treatment of congestive heart failure.
   ``What he represented and has represented in the past is the
worst of the labor movement,'' said New Jersey State Police
Superintendant Col. Clinton L. Pagano.
   A convicted murderer and extortionist, Provenzano engendered
strong loyalty in Teamsters Local 560 in Union City, N.J. It was the
nation's third-largest local with 13,000 members when he ruled it in
the early 1960s.
   Ousted Local 560 officer Michael Sciarra in court called
Provenzano his ``idol'' and said he would ``pray'' for his return
after Provenzano was sentenced to jail in 1978 for ordering the
murder of a union rival.
   Sciarra was on the union board that U.S. District Judge Harold A.
Ackerman deposed in 1984 after finding in a government suit that the
local had been dominated by the Genovese organized-crime family.
   The union functioned under a trustee for 2{ years before members
last week elected a new leadership of Sciarra proteges, headed by
his brother, Danny. A judge had barred Michael Sciarra from running
because of his ties to the local's old regime.
   In July 1975, Hoffa disappeared while on his way to a Detroit
meeting with Provenzano, then president of his local. Hoffa is
presumed dead, but his body was never found.
   According to an FBI memo, Hoffa and Provenzano had feuded when
both were in federal prison. The FBI speculated Hoffa had hoped to
make peace with Provenzano and forge an alliance that would aid his
drive to regain power.
   ``According to the FBI reconstruction of the Hoffa murder, Tony
Pro called the so-called peace parley with Hoffa and then ordered
him killed,'' according to Carl Sifakis, author of Mafia
Encyclopedia.
   Provenzano was born to Italian immigrant parents on New York
City's Lower East Side and began driving a truck in Hackensack,
N.J., in 1934 at age 17. He became a Local 560 shop steward in 1941,
rose to business agent in 1950 and president eight years later.
   One year later, Provenzano came to head the New Jersey Joint
Teamsters Council, which represented 80,000 truckers. In 1960, he
became one of 13 vice presidents of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
   He ``influenced the Teamsters at the highest level. He was the
epitome of control by intimidation,'' said Pagano. ``They controlled
whether a business would or would not function simply by whether
goods moved in or out.''
   Provenzano went to prison in 1966 for extorting $17,000 from a
truck company in exchange for labor peace. His brothers, Salvatore
and Nunzio, who also have been imprisoned for racketeering and
extortion, maintained control of the local.
   Anthony Provenzano was sentenced to life in prison in 1978 in New
York state for a union rival's murder. He was sentenced in federal
court the following year for racketeering.
   He would have been eligible for release in 1992.

   A 6-month-old girl was fatally mauled by a
pit bull that a witness said was apparently after a cookie the baby
was holding.
   ``It was awful,'' said Helen Douglas, who lives in the apartment
next door to the girl's parents, Greg Vergara and Carrie Haverstock
Vergara.
   ``I was there, I saw it. I saw it every time I closed my eyes
last night,'' Ms. Douglas said Monday.
   The baby, Amber Haverstock, died Sunday night at Akron Children's
Hospital Medical Center, nearly five hours after the attack,
authorities said.
   Fire Department paramedic Tim O'Brien said the baby was badly
mauled. She had been bitten in the face and neck.
   ``There were bites over her entire body, especially the upper
torso,'' said O'Brien.
   Ms. Douglas said she and her brother, Robert Nieb, were in the
apartment next door when they heard the screams of the mother and
child, who were alone in their apartment with the family dog.
   ``We ran next door and ... my brother tried to get the baby and
the dog,'' she said. At least three attempts to rescue the baby were
unsuccessful, she said, and ``finally, he (the dog) just let her
go.''
   Police turned the dog, a 5-year-old male, over to the Stark
County Animal Control Department.
   ``I'll tell you one thing, that dog's never leaving here alive,''
department director Phil Palumbo said when he learned the child had
died.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem factions battled today
with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in south Beirut,
where most of the foreign hostages are believed held. Police said at
least one militiaman was killed.
   The violence came one day after kidnappers holding U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins announced that they had decided to put
him to death for allegedly spying for Israel.
   Police said one combatant was killed and three pedestrians were
wounded in the fighting between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The battles went on for two hours in the streets of the Chiyah
and Hay Madi districts before Syrian troops in charge of security in
Beirut's Moslem sector moved in to stop them.
   Many of the 15 hostages in Lebanon are believed held in Hay Madi,
Hezbollah's main stronghold in south Beirut. Hezbollah is believed
to be an umbrella for pro-Iranian extremists holding the foreigners.
   Amal and Hezbollah have long been vying for dominance of the 1
million Shiites in Lebanon. They clashed in a six-day battle in west
and south Beirut two weeks ago. Police reported 40 people killed and
87 wounded in that confrontation.
   ``There was no way at the time and today (Tuesday) to ascertain
whether the hostages have been affected by the fighting,'' said a
police spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Higgins' kidnappers call themselves the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, which is sponsored publicly by Hezbollah.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' the group said in a statement released in Beirut on
Monday night.
   ``The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing
this just and revolutionary verdict,'' said the 15-line Arabic
statement that was delivered to the Beirut newspaper An-Nahar. It
set no date for Higgins' death.
   A photocopy of a picture of Higgins was pasted to the bottom of
the typewritten statement. Kidnappers often use photographs to
authenticate their statements.
   The picture, the second of Higgins released in 10 months,
resembled an photograph released April 21. It showed the balding man
stoop-shouldered with his eyes downcast away from the camera. He had
a gray stubble and was wearing a dark field jacket.
   ``It has been proven by clearcut evidence that he (Higgins) and
his American team of observers are guilty of providing the Zionist
enemy with accurate and detailed military information about our
resistance fighters,'' the statement said.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped Feb. 17. He headed a
76-man observer team attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was quoted by the
Lebanese media as appealing to Higgins' captors to spare his life.
   Eight other Americans are held in Lebanon. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A man who murdered an immigrant
restaurateur as the man's wife watched was put to death by injection
early today in an execution delayed when a tube from an intravenous
needle sprung a leak.
   Raymond Landry, 39, was pronounced dead at 12:45 a.m., hours
after the U.S. Supreme Court spared a second convicted murderer from
being executed.
   Landry was the 104th person executed in the United States since
the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 and 11th
this year.
   Prison officials began administering the lethal dosage at 12:21
a.m. Landry was not pronounced dead until 24 minutes later. In
between, a tube attached to a needle inside his right arm began
leaking, sending the lethal mixture shooting across the death
chamber toward witnesses.
   ``There was something of a delay in the execution because of what
officials called a `blowout,''' said Charles Brown, spokesman for
the Texas Department of Corrections. ``The syringe came out of the
vein and the warden ordered the (execution) team to reinsert the
catheter into the vein.''
   After Landry was brought into the death chamber, he shook his
head briefly when asked by Warden Jack Pursley if he had something
to say.
   At first, he showed no reaction to the drugs, and his lips
quivered.
   The leak occurred two minutes after the injections began.
   Pursley quickly pulled a curtain across the viewing area to block
witnesses' views. For more than 14 minutes, witnesses heard doors
opening and closing, mumbling, and at least one groan.
   The curtain was then reopened and Landry was motionless and
appeared dead with his eyes half closed.
   Three minutes later, two doctors arrived. They declared him dead
at 12:45 a.m.
   Brown said it was the first time such a problem had occurred in
Texas, which leads the nation with 29 executions since resumption of
capital punishment. In 1985 however, authorities repeatedly jabbed
needles into Stephen Morin when they had trouble finding a usable
vein because he had been a drug abuser.
   Landry was convicted in the death of Kosmas Prittis, a Greek
immigrant who was robbed and shot in the head while he and his
family were closing their Houston restaurant in 1982.
   Landry, an 11th-grade dropout, had a lengthy criminal record,
including arrests for sexual assault and abuse of a juvenile,
assault, family neglect and petty larceny.
   Late Monday, the Supreme Court blocked the execution of Samuel
Hawkins, who was convicted of the 1976 rape-slaying of a 19-year-old
woman. Had he been put to death along with Landry, it would have
been the first time since 1976 that a state had put two people to
death on the same day.
   The high court voted 7-2 earlier Monday to reject Landry's appeal.
   In appeals for each inmate, defense attorneys cited a case
pending before the Supreme Court involving Texas death-row inmate
Johnny Penry. That case challenges the legality of executing
mentally retarded inmates.
   ``This man isn't retarded,'' assistant attorney general Bob Walt
said of Landry. ``I don't think that's going to fly with the Supreme
Court.''
   In January, Landry came within three hours of execution before
the Supreme Court issued a stay.
   Hawkins, 45, was convicted in the death of Abbe Rogers Hamilton
of Borger, who was killed after Hawkins entered her apparently
unlocked home.
   Hawkins also has a second death sentence for the abduction and
slaying of a 12-year-old Amarillo girl. He has been dubbed the
``traveling rapist'' after admitting to some 40 rapes, prosecutors
said.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Once Again To Consider Bids For PTL's Assets</HEAD>

   The trustee overseeing PTL says he
believes a bankruptcy judge is likely to reject a bid for the
television ministry by a Canadian businessman and to sell the
ministry's assets piecemeal.
   Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds was unlikely to extend the sale and probably would reject
the high bid of $36.25 million made Monday by Stephen Mernick, a
Toronto real estate developer.
   ``His (Reynolds') patience has been tested, and I don't think
he'll want to go any further,'' Benton said Monday.
   Reynolds was scheduled to rule on the sale of PTL's assets during
a hearing this afternoon in Columbia.
   PTL's religious leader, Sam Johnson, said Monday he hoped
Reynolds would keep intact the ministry's complex here, called
Heritage USA, and give PTL's contributors more time to secure
financing to buy back the ministry. Johnson is president of Heritage
Ministries, PTL's non-profit arm.
   Benton predicted Reynolds would order the ministry's assets
liquidated. But he said it was possible the judge would open bidding
again on the 2,200 acres of property, which includes a 500-room
hotel, a water park, a television studio and a 2,000-seat church.
   The bidders and Benton compared Monday's auction, in which bids
were raised in increments ranging from $1,000 to about $1 million,
to a card game in which the players withheld their final bet and
gambled that Reynolds would change the the conditions of the sale
today. One condition was that bidding begin at $50 million.
   ``Nobody won this afternoon,'' bidder Cy Bahakel, a former North
Carolina state senator who owns 15 television stations, said Monday.
``It's a new ballgame tomorrow in court.''
   The ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987,
three months after founder Jim Bakker left amid revelations of
luxurious living and hush money paid to Jessica Hahn, a secretary at
a New York church with whom Bakker admitting having a sexual liaison.
   The offers Monday were far below the appraised value of PTL's
assets _ $92 million to $110 million _ and half of that offered in
the initial auction in November.
   A month ago, Mernick said he would pay $115 million, $50 million
of it in cash. But Reynolds rejected the bid, saying there were
inadequate assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65
million.
   The four apparent contenders for the assets _ Mernick, Bahakel,
Johnson's group and a new bidder, Michael Karas, president of First
Canadian Development Co. of Toronto _ all said they were prepared to
bid again today.
   Heritage Ministries did not bid at Monday's auction, which was
closed to the public, but Johnson said he was negotiating with other
bidders on a joint offer.
   Johnson, pastor of the church at Heritage USA, said he held off
bidding because he was unwilling to meet a condition that called for
the downpayment to be forfeited if a bidder was unable to secure
financing.
   Johnson's group held a telethon on PTL's TV show last weekend
that brought its kitty up to $5 million for the downpayment.
   In another PTL development, former PTL officials David and James
Taggart, who face federal tax charges, were sued by New York jeweler
Cartier for $158,925 it says they owe for items they purchased last
year.
   Cartier, in its suit filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court
in Charlotte, N.C., says the debt is the balance the Taggarts owe
for $203,925 they spent at Cartier on May 23, 1987. That was about a
month after PTL officials dismissed David Taggart, once Bakker's top
aide. His brother, James, did interior design work for PTL until
early 1987.
   The Taggarts have declined requests for interviews for the past
18 months and have referred questions to their Washington attorney,
Ben Cotton, who did not return telephone calls Monday.

   City police were ordered to wear
shoulder-harness seat belts after two patrol cars collided, killing
three officers and injuring a fourth on his first day on the job.
   ``It is a terrible loss, three young men in the prime of their
lives. These young men were very eager and very aggressive,'' said
Chief Daryl Gates, who issued the order.
   The officers killed were not wearing seat belts.
   Previously, department policy gave officers the option of wearing
either lap belts or belts with shoulder harnesses. The officer who
survived Monday's 3:25 a.m. crash was wearing a seat belt but it was
not immediately known which type.
   The cruisers collided when the officers were en route to aid
plainclothes detectives who pulled over a car reported stolen. One
of the cruisers was traveling the wrong way down a one-way street.
   Fellow officers wept during their roll calls when told of the
deaths.
   ``It's like a bomb hit them,'' a somber Gates said. ``It's hard
to see grown men cry.'' Flags at all stations were to be flown at
half staff.
   The mood, however, did not soften Gates' criticism of the dead
officers. Both cars appeared to have been traveling in excess of the
35 mph city speed limit, and emergency flashing lights or sirens may
have been in operation. The use of lights or sirens to respond to a
call for backup would have been in violation of department
regulations.
   ``This is a good example of what happens when you do not follow
the rules,'' Gates said. It was not known how fast the cars were
going but Gates said, ``They were moving at a rate of speed you
could call overdrive.''
   Officers may ignore rules of the road only when responding to the
more serious ``officer needs help call.''
   Officer David Hofmeyer, 25, who was driving one cruiser, and his
passenger, Officer Derrick Conner, 28, were dead at the scene. The
other driver, Officer Manuel Gutierrez Jr., 26, died later at
County-USC Medical Center. His cruiser was traveling the wrong way
on the one-way street.
   Gutierrez's partner, Officer Venson Drake, 28, was treated for
cuts and bruises at the hospital and released. Drake graduated last
Friday from the department's training academy.
   Before Monday, the city's worst accident involving police
officers occurred in 1983 when a driver ran a stop light and
broadsided a cruiser, killing two patrolmen. The driver survived the
crash and escaped.

   A man buried by the Armenian earthquake said he bit
the earth and shoveled with his nose to make his way out of the
rubble of his collapsed factory.
   Misha Nuridzhanyan rushed to find his wife and three children,
only to learn they were trapped beneath separate buildings.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda today published an account by
the Leninakan sewing factory inspector who was caught in the Dec. 7
quake that killed up to 60,000 people throughout Armenia and
destroyed much of his city.
   ``At 11:30, we felt faint tremors,'' Nuridzhanyan recalled.
``Everybody jumped up and ran for the stairs. But we succeeded in
running only 10-15 meters, and then everything collapsed. If I had
not grabbed a pillar, I would have been thrown by the shock, 20
meters, not less. I don't remember anything after that.
   ``When I came to, it was dark. I was curled like a fetus, not
flat, but _ how can I explain _ like a rolled bun, with my head
hunched down between my shoulders. Apparently I instinctively shrank
when everything started to fall all around me.
   ``I waited _ would there be another tremor or not? Certainly, if
another quake hit, nothing would be left of me. Around me, I could
hear my friends shouting to each other.
   ```Where are you?'
   ```My leg is squeezed.'
   ```My hand...'
   ```Please talk to me. Don't keep silent.'
   ``It was terrifying, a nightmare.
   ``I tried to move and could not. Everything was squeezed _ my
hands, my legs, my chest. Just my head was free. From the roof, dirt
and sand were pouring onto me. I felt someone's blood flowing over
me. I bit into the dirt with my teeth, and shoveled with my nose.
   ``Then a light appeared. After I crawled out, I don't know why,
but I looked at my watch _ it still ran. I realized that I had spent
an hour and a half in a grave. I just lay down on the top of the
rubble and my mind went blank. Then I was awakened by voices saying,
`Go home, go home.'
   ``I could see that there was no help, no one was helping to dig
through the rubble. Somebody managed to crawl out by himself. He was
in his underwear, because all his clothes had been peeled off by the
stones as he crawled out.
   ``I went barefoot to a hospital. I stayed there until 4 p.m. Then
I was given a lift home. I went there, thinking: with two little
children, nothing can happen _ because my daughter is going to first
grade and the school is just two stories, so it should stand the
shock. My son is in kindergarten, a one-story building. My wife
works at a two-story building. And the youngest is with my
mother-in-law at home, a five-story building.
   ``I was brought to the rubble. Everything had collapsed. There my
beloved ones were lying, and there they remain today.
   ``I stood up and didn't know where to move. I went to the house
of my sister, where she and her husband screamed at me, ``Misha, you
must go to the doctor, your head is bleeding.'' I couldn't care less
about my head, no, I couldn't leave before I found my child. But I
started to feel sick in the night. I was taken to Yerevan by
helicopter.
   ``Now, I know I have 27 stitches in my head and I feel the pain.
But then, I felt nothing.''

<HEAD>NRC Free To Consider License For Shoreham Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has cleared the way for the five-member commission to consider an
operating license for the Long Island Lighting Co.'s long-delayed
Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   The staff on Monday agreed with a September decision by the
Atomic Safety Licensing Board, which found that New York state and
Suffolk County had willfully obstructed the federal government's
attempt to resolve the Shoreham stalemate.
   The $5.3 billion plant, which was completed in 1984, has been
unable to obtain an operating license because the state and local
governments maintain that the surrounding area of densely populated
Long Island could not be evacuated in an emergency.
   If the commission accepts its staff's advice to uphold the
board's recommendation that the local and state governments be
dismissed from the Shoreham proceedings, no issues will remain to
prevent a full-power license for the plant, said Frank Ingram, a
commission spokesman in Washington.
   Ray Golden, a Lilco spokesman, said the utility was ``very
pleased ... and optimistic that the NRC commissioners will act
quickly on approval'' of a license.
   Brad O'Hearn, a spokesman for Suffolk County Executive Patrick
Halpin, said the county ``will pursue vigorously with the full NRC
board our contention that Shoreham should not be operated'' because
of evacuation concerns.
   Lilco has sought a full- or 25 percent-power license for Shoreham
despite a settlement reached between the state and the utility to
close the plant. The utility's directors have said Lilco would abide
by the settlement if the state Legislature approved it before a
license was granted.
   The lawmakers, who objected to the settlement as too generous to
LILCO, left Albany without approving it. The settlement would allow
the utility to increase rates 5 percent annually over 10 years.
   On Dec. 5, a U.S. District Court jury in New York City found that
Lilco and a former executive engaged in a pattern of lies to obtain
rate increases to help pay for the Shoreham plant.
   The jury awarded $7.6 million to Suffolk County. That amount is
tripled to $22.8 million under the racketeering charges brought
against the utility.

<HEAD>Crash May Have Been Caused By Misunderstanding, Pilot Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash of a Yugoslav military
plane bringing earthquake relief to Armenia may have been caused by
a misunderstanding between the pilot and Soviet air traffic
controllers, a Yugoslav pilot was quoted as saying today.
   The Yugoslav Air Force AN-12 plane crashed Monday while trying to
land at Yerevan airport, killing all seven people aboard. Local
reporters said the pilot mistook a well-lit highway for a runway.
   Capt. Ljubomir Pavlovic, who landed another Yugoslav plane at
Yerevan airport hours after the crash, told the state news agency
Tanjug that the Soviet Union has not adopted an International Civil
Airports' Association recommendation on measurement of altitude.
   As a result, he said, there was ``a possibility of a
misunderstanding between the Yugoslav crew and the Soviet flight
control in Yerevan.''
   A common method used at domestic airports in the Soviet Union is
to read altitude in meters, while international practice is to read
the distance of the plane above the ground in feet.
   Pavlovic said Yerevan airport, where dozens of flights are
landing daily as earthquake relief pours into Armenia, is not
equipped to receive international flights.
   ``I assume that the airport has now received technical and staff
assistance from Moscow and Leningrad,'' Pavlovic told Tanjug.
   Pavlovic suggested fatigue also might have played a part in the
crash. He said the crew prepared all day Sunday for takeoff, and
flew for four hours before being forced by bad weather to make an
emergency landing in Ankara, Turkey.
   Tanjug described Pavlovic as an experienced pilot who has flown
to the Soviet Union often. He spoke to Tanjug after returning from
Yerevan.
   The Soviets and the Yugoslavs have formed a joint commission to
investigate the plane crash, Tanjug said.
   The Dec. 7 quake devastated Armenia. A Soviet official today put
the death toll from the quake at 55,000.

<HEAD>Justice Brennan Undergoes Gall Bladder Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan was
reported in satisfactory condition today following surgery to remove
his gall bladder.
   No malignancy was detected in the surgery Monday afternoon, court
spokeswoman Toni House said. ``He is in good condition this morning,
doing very well,'' she added.
   Brennan, 82, was originally diagnosed as having pneumonia when
admiitted to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center last week. He had
been suffering from chills and fever.
   Ms. House said that further tests showed Brennan had a gall
bladder disease, which his doctors said can display similar symptoms.
   Brennan is expected to return to work by the time the court
begins its January session, Ms. House said.
   Last week a court spokeswoman reported that Brennan was
responding to treatment with antibiotics and that he might return to
work early into a four-week recess the court began on Monday.
   Brennan, the court's oldest and most senior member, had
participated in the court's oral arguments last Wednesday and
reportedly has enjoyed good health recently.
   His last hospitalization occurred in August 1987 when he checked
into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for tests on a troublesome
prostate gland. The tests revealed he did not have cancer.
   In 1979 Brennan had a stroke that left his right hand partially
paralyzed, and a year earlier he was treated for a cancerous growth
on a vocal cord.
   Brennan was appointed to the nation's highest court by President
Eisenhower in 1956.

<HEAD>Ireland Refuses to Extradite Suspected IRA Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general announced today he
has rejected a British request to extradite a Roman Catholic priest
with suspected terrorist connections, believing Britain would not
give him a fair trial.
   Attorney General John Murray, who made the decision, said the
Rev. Patrick Ryan might face trial in Ireland on charges of
involvement in Irish Republican Army bombings.
   In concluding Ryan could not be fairly tried, Murray cited
British official and press attacks on Ryan which were ``expressed in
intemperate language and frequently in the form of extravagantly
worded headlines.''
   Britain's seeks Ryan on four warrants alleging conpiracy to
murder and cause explosions, and possessing explosives. Ryan insists
he is innocent and the affair has sparked a diplomatic furor
involving Britain, Ireland and Belgium.
   The Belgian government provoked British anger when, instead of
extraditing Ryan, it sent the 58-year-old priest home to Ireland on
Nov. 25. Ryan, who had been on a three-week hunger strike to protest
extradition, checked into a clinic outside Dublin and dropped from
sight three days later.
   ``It is not enough to sign ringing declarations against
terrorism. What matters is effective action,'' Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said on Dec. 3 at the European Economic Community
summit where she berated Prime Minister Wilfried Martens of Belgium
and Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland.
   Murray, who considered the extradition warrant for two weeks,
said Britain was responsible for his decision.
   ``They (the British) raised the case to a unique status and can
only have intensified the impact and lasting effect on members of
the public of what was being published in the written and
broadcasting media,'' his statement said.
   ``Further, the statements in the House of Commons must, because
of their origin, carry particular weight with potential jurors.''
   The British charges against Ryan should be investigated by a
court, said Murray, who issued a 16-page document supporting his
decision. The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act provides that offenses
committed abroad may be tried in Ireland.
   ``Such a trial may, under Irish law, take place before a court of
three judges without a jury,'' Murray said, adding that he had asked
London for the evidence against Ryan.
   Mrs. Thatcher made no comment on Murray's ruling but aides said
she was ``extremely disappointed.''
   Ian Gow, a lawmaker for her Conservative Party, said: ``I'm
afraid it's very good news for the IRA. It's a good day for them and
a bad day for those who want to defeat terrorism.''
   But Kevin McNamara, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
Irish affairs, said: ``I have sufficient faith in the integrity of
the Irish attorney general to know that he would have made his
decision dispassionately.''
   Ryan was suspended by his Pallottine order in 1974 after he
refused a transfer to a parish church in England.
   Ryan's cousin, Tom Ryan, told the British Broadcasting Corp. that
the priest remained in hiding.
   ``Absolutely and without any reservation I believe that he is
totally innocent,'' Ryan said. He said his cousin's only crime was
to feed and clothe families of dead and jailed Irish nationalists in
Northern Ireland. That might relieve pressure on the IRA's funds, he
said, but ``that kind of guilt is on a whole lot of us here,
thousands of us,'' he said.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to rid Northern
Ireland of British rule and unite the province and its Protestant
majority with the Irish Republic.

   Bob Hope has a suggestion for President Reagan after
he leaves the White House in January.
   ``He should be the secretary of peace,'' said Hope in a serious
moment during a break in weekend rehearsals for his annual Christmas
show, filmed in the Miami area this year.
   ``What a personality,'' he said of Reagan, a former film star
he's known for 45 years. ``Everybody likes him _ (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev, (French President Francois) Mitterrand and
(British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher. He's even tried to make
peace with the Ayatollah Khomeini. I'm so proud of him,'' said Hope,
who has known nine U.S. presidents.
   Hope's theme for this year's NBC yuletide extravaganza, however,
is world-class athletes.
   The one-hour special, to air Dec. 17, includes The Associated
Press All-America football team; Cy Young award-winner Orel
Hershiser, a Los Angeles Dodger pitcher; and Florence ``Flo-Jo''
Griffith Joyner, winner of three gold medals and one silver medal at
the Summer Olympics in Seoul.
   Co-starring with the 84-year-old Hope is country singer Dolly
Parton. Actor Don Johnson of NBC's ``Miami Vice'' also appears in
the show.
   Shooting locations included the new luxury cruise ship Royal
Viking Sun, docked here for its first port of call in the United
States, and Williams Island, a plush residential resort compound.
   Ms. Griffith Joyner and Hershiser have their singing debut,
joining Hope and Ms. Parton in ``It's Not Where You Start ... It's
Where You Finish.'' The two athletes also perform in vignettes with
Hope.
   Ms. Griffith Joyner, world record-holder in the 100- and
200-meter dashes, confirmed her plans to retire from athletic
competition, and said she plans a career in show business.

<HEAD>Nuke Weapon Plant Renovation Expense Put At $50 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Energy Department report estimates it will
cost $50 billion to renovate deteriorating nuclear weapons
facilities and recommends that all production be done in Idaho,
Tennessee and South Carolina, according to sources familiar with the
report.
   The report has been sent to the White House, which was to send it
to the House and Senate Armed Services committees later this week.
But administration source said the committees may not get it until
later.
   Congressional and administrative sources described some
provisions of the ``2010 Report'' _ which looks to the year 2010 _
on condition of anonymity. Accounts of the report appeared over the
weekend and on Monday in The Washington Post and the Los Angeles
Times.
   The plan would organize many weapons activities around the
principal nuclear material involved, eventually concentrating all
plutonium processing at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory
near Idaho Falls, uranium activities at Oak Ridge, Tenn., and
tritium activities at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,
congressional sources said.
   This would mean closing the Rocky Flats plant near Denver, which
makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered by
tritium, and the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald,
Ohio., a uranium foundry, according to the report.
   The Rocky Flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of its
buildings because of accidental contamination of three employees in
October. The Savannah River tritium reactors are temporarily closed
to upgrade safety equipment and procedures.
   Doug Elmets, press secretary for the department, declined to
comment on the report.
   The department's $6.8 billion plan to replace its tritium
reactors, released last summer, called for a new Savannah River
reactor and only one Idaho reactor, though the Idaho reactor was of
a ``modular'' design that could be reproduced easily.
   Both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium,
according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with. To
produce tritium, lithium is added to fuel assemblies.
   Tritium decays fairly rapidly _ 5.5 percent of any starting
amount turns into inert helium in a year _ and must be replenished
in nuclear weapons from time to time. Supply figures are secret. No
such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium components,
which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old ones are
retired.
   One congressional source said the department was faced with a
choice of where to put the plutonium site, Idaho Falls or the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and it chose Idaho
because of growing opposition in the Richland area and the severity
of contamination there.
   An administration source said the Energy Department had not
changed its estimate that $110 billion would be needed over the next
40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories and
laboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weapons
and components.

<HEAD>Witness Says He Lied in Family-Poisoning Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to free a farmworker imprisoned in
the poisoning deaths of his seven children two decades ago may be
gaining momentum after a witness admitted he lied at the man's
trial, the man's lawyers say.
   The last surviving witness to an alleged jailhouse confession
that helped convict James Richardson of one of the 1967 killings
recanted his courtroom story during recent interviews with
investigators. The interviews were ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez to
re-examine the trial.
   ``I didn't hear Richardson say anything while I was in there,''
James Weaver, 67, said in the interviews, according to the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement. ``I ain't never heard the boy say
anything about it. ... I hope Richardson will get out. I want him to
get out.''
   Peter Dunbar, the governor's general counsel, said Weaver's
statement also was contained in an old prosecution file that
Richardson's lawyer, Mark Lane, turned over to Martinez' office two
months ago. Lane said the file had been stolen years earlier by
someone concerned about the case.
   ``There appears to be some foundation to some of the
allegations,'' Dunbar said. ``Now, whether or not that has some
bearing is what we'll have to decide.''
   Richardson, 52, of Arcadia was convicted of one of the killings
and sentenced to life after he was accused of putting the deadly
insecticide parathion in food a baby sitter served his children,
ages 2 to 8.
   Lane and Richardson's other attorney, Ellis Rubin, said Weaver's
admission will help when they petition for a new trial Thursday.
   Rubin and Lane said they will file appeals to the state Supreme
Court and the trial court, charging the state knowingly used
perjured testimony.
   ``I want a jury to hear that he was framed, and to bring out the
perjury on the record,'' Rubin said.
   Martinez will wait until after he has been briefed on the state
investigative report this week to decide whether to call for a
clemency hearing, said Brian Ballard, the governor's director of
operations.
   Some of the most damaging testimony against Richardson at his
1968 trial came from Weaver and another jailed felon, James Dean
Cunningham. Authorities contended that Richardson, a fruit picker,
confessed to both men while awaiting trial.
   A third convict who also allegedly heard Richardson confess died
before trial, but his similar account was read into the record.
Cunningham was shot to death in 1979.
   Weaver's recantation is the latest development that casts doubt
on Richardson's conviction, his lawyers say.
   Earlier this year it was reported that the former baby sitter,
Betsy Reese, now 67, told nurses in a nursing home in 1985 that she
had poisoned the children.
   Last week, Arcadia's former police chief, Richard Barnard, said
he believed that Richardson was framed by then-DeSoto County Sheriff
Frank Cline.
   Weaver and Cunningham ``would have done or said anything that
Frank Cline asked them to do, including making false statements
under oath,'' in return for lenient sentences, Barnard said.
   Cline disputed Barnard's allegation. And prosecutors say the baby
sitter, who is immobile and has lapsed into silence, became confused
over the years after having innocently served a poisoned meal.
   Richardson is eligible for parole in 1993.

   Police searched with tracker dogs and
helicopters but found no clues today to the theft of one of Vincent
van Gogh's ``The Potato Eaters'' and two other works by the Dutch
impressionist master.
   Monday night's burglary at the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum
appears to be Holland's biggest art theft. Also taken were the
19th-century Dutch master's ``Dried Sunflowers'' and ``Weaver's
Interior.''
   Police spokesman Karel van Seventer said the 30-strong task force
this morning abandoned its search of the national park that
surrounds the museum. They have no leads to the thieves' identities
or whereabouts of the oil paintings, he said.
   The burglars smashed an 8-foot square window to get into the
sprawling one-story museum, Seventer said. Two guards on duty in the
museum were not alerted. But the burglars triggered an alarm at Ede
police station, 10 miles away and police surrounded the park near
the West German border within minutes, he said. Nearby border posts
were alerted.
   There was no official estimate of Kroeller-Mueller's ``The Potato
Eaters,'' the second of three versions Van Gogh painted in 1885, and
the other two works, which were finished in 1887. All belong to the
state.
   Experts from Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses in Amsterdam
said the final and most important version of ``The Potato Eaters''
is on display in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh National Museum.
   The series marks one of Van Gogh's harshest expressions of
poverty and famine in the southern Netherlands where he was born.
Done in dark pigments, all three paintings show a peasant family
seated around a table and eating potatoes under a hanging lamp, with
suffering evident on their rough faces.
   Van Gogh is the world's best-selling artist. Five of his
paintings were on the list this month of the top 10 prices paid for
paintings at Christie's and Sotheby's. His painting ``Irises''
attracted the highest recorded price paid for a painting _ $53.9
million in 1987.
   ``What on earth can be the reason why to steal these paintings?''
asked Christie's Amsterdam director, Harts Nijstad. ``The answer can
only be, if you ask me, ransom money. Whether the ransom will be ...
moneywise or political is something the future will tell us.''
   Seventer said he believes the theft was committed by more than
one thief because of the size of the paintings.
   ``Wilted Sunflowers'' measures 40 inches by 24 inches, ``The
Potato Eaters'' is 37 by 29 inches and ``Weaver's Interior'' is 34
by 28 inches, according to the Culture Ministry.
   This morning, police began interviewing the museum management and
guards as well as five game keepers living inside the park grounds,
Seventer said.
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum is named for industrialist and art
lover Mrs. H.E.L.J. Kroeller-Mueller, who bequeathed it to the
nation in 1938. It contains 278 Van Gogh paintings, sketches and
etchings.
   Seventer said the Van Goghs, the centerpiece of the collection,
are housed in a separate wing 60 feet from the smashed window.

   Survivors of the Armenian earthquake are
freezing to death at night because only a fraction of the thousands
of tents sent to the disaster area reach the homeless, a Soviet
newspaper reported today.
   Rescuers struggled to haul heavy equipment into the disaster area
and evacuate victims, despite roads jammed with grieving relatives,
a mountain snowstorm and temperatures that dropped below zero
Fahrenheit.
   The Foreign Ministry today put the official death toll from the
Dec. 7 quake at 55,000 and the number of injured to 13,000.
   Hope dwindled for those trapped in the ruins, and the smell of
decaying corpses filled the air. Rescuers have pulled 18,500 people
from the wreckage in the past four days, but only 5,400 people were
alive, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters today in Moscow.
   Newspaper accounts made it clear that despite the outpouring of
international aid, Armenians were suffering from lack of shelter and
medical care.
   ``In the corridor of a hospital, a man ran about, clutching the
tiny body of a child to his breast, crying, ``Please, help me!''
said the newspaper Socialisticheska Industria, in an article that
also told how doctors were pressed into service building temporary
housing.
   The Communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said 60,000
tents have been sent to the disaster area, but most of the 500,000
homeless are shivering around bonfires in the ruins.
   ``The collapsed villages are suffering especially from the
disaster,'' the newspaper said, citing helicopter Capt. Sergei
Bobylev. In one village 20 children died in the quake and ``now
survivors are dying from cold,'' the newspaper said.
   Only two roads and one railroad are open to the mountainous
disaster area, hindering delivery of cranes and bulldozers. The
labor newspaper Trud reported evacuees cut off by a snowstorm. Many
supplies are arriving by helicopter and parachute.
   ``Our nation is so undeveloped we can't even receive help
properly,'' said one unidentified air traffic controller on the
verge of tears at the airport in Yerevan, the Armenian capital 50
miles to the southeast of the disaster area.
   In hard-hit Leninakan, once a city of 250,000, the remaining
residents were beginning to suffer from the lack of drinking water,
sewage and garbage-hauling facilities, and transport, said
Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   The newspaper said it was understandable that officials
responsible for such services were in a state of shock, ``as
practically everyone lost families,'' but the lack of action could
not continue.
   In some towns, no one was organizing relief efforts because all
the officials died in the quake, Soviet television reported Monday
night.
   Relief efforts were blocked in the first days after the quake by
huge traffic jams, as an ``avalanche'' of worried relatives drove to
the disaster area, Socialisticheskaya Industria said.
   ``The ambulances were flashing their lights in vain,'' the
newspaper said. ``Dead-tired traffic inspectors tried to stop cars
with their chests. But their self-sacrifice couldn't change the
disorganization.''
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov admitted to reporters Monday that
rescue efforts suffered from a lack of organization. But he said he
could not find fault with the enthusiasm of thousands of rescue and
medical workers, or of the 19,000 soldiers keeping order.
   Sverre Kilde, a U.N. disaster relief officer, said no Soviet
troops were visible in Leninakan, although they can be seen hauling
supplies in many photographs of the disaster area.
   ``Here there are 50-60 people shouting in all directions,'' said
Kilde, speaking of a site he visited in Leninakan on Sunday. ``It
would have been much more reasonable to have an army captain or
colonel in charge of it.''
   The Politburo commission overseeing the rescue efforts on Monday
visited some villages near Leninakan and Spitak _ a city of 25,000
that was nearly destroyed by the quake _ and found them in equally
bad condition as the two cities, Ryzhkov said.
   He also said that many people died unnecessarily in the quake due
to ``gross violations'' in planning and building apartment buildings
that collapsed on occupants.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who visited the area during
the weekend, and a government commission also believe there were
``very many violations,'' he said.
   ``If the homes had been of good quality construction, something
like this would not have happened,'' Ryzhkov said. A commission was
formed to review the construction.
   He said the ruined cities will be rebuilt within two years, but
that no new buildings will be taller than three or four stories. The
estimated cost of rebuilding will be at least 5 billion rubles ($8
billion dollars), Ryzhkov said.
   The earthquake destroyed hundreds of new apartment buildings in
Leninakan, Spitak and Kirovakan. Some Leninakan residents have
complained that until 20 years ago, no buildings in the area were
more than two or three stories high.
   A broken concrete slab with the words ``This piece of concrete is
not to be used'' written on it lay in the rubble in Leninakan.

   South Africa, Cuba and Angola pledged
peace in Southwestern Africa today, opening the way for withdrawal
of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola and independence for the
continent's last colony of Namibia.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who led eight
months of intermittent negotiations on three continents, said the
accord is ``a new symbol of peace in the world.''
   It ends years of negotiating over one of Africa's most
intractable disputes.
   Officials of the three countries signed the agreement, to be
finalized in New York on Dec. 22, at a ceremony attended by Crocker,
host President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo and Soviet and United
Nations' representatives.
   ``We want to be accepted by our African brothers. We need each
other,'' South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha declared after he
signed for the white-led country. ``A new era has begun. We are
removing race discrimination,'' he said.
   Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban vice minister for foreign affairs, and
Angolan armed forces chief Gen. Antonio dos Santos Ndalu signed for
their governments.
   Botha earlier told reporters the U.N.-supervised independence
process for South-West Africa, which is better known as Namibia,
will begin April 1. Elections will be held seven months later and
the mineral-rich territory will be independent in about a year, he
said.
   Mediated by the United States and supported by the Soviet Union,
the agreement will free the former German colony from 73 years of
South African control and end 22 years of sporadic bush warfare.
   ``This will bring an end to international conflict in
Southwestern Africa,'' Crocker said. ``It is the end of a sad
chapter in African history.''
   Still unsettled is the civil war in Angola between the pro-Soviet
government and rebels backed by South Africa and the United States.
But the treaty will bar the involvement of South African and Cuban
forces in that arena, scaling down its potential for regional
conflict.
   Under today's agreement, 3,000 Cuban soldiers will leave Angola
before April 1 and the rest will withdraw within 27 months from that
date. Half the Cubans will be out by the time Namibian elections are
held Nov. 1.
   At the same time, remaining Cuban forces will gradually move
north from the Namibian border. By election time, they are all to be
north of the Benguela railroad, at least 350 miles from Namibia.
   The three countries are to establish a joint commission to
resolve disputes about implementing the peace accords and Angola and
Cuba are to reach agreements with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar on means to verify the Cuban pullout.
   Crocker praised the ``close, practical and effective cooperation
with our Soviet counterparts.'' The Soviet Union was not formally
involved but played a significant role in bringing the parties
together.
   To applause from African diplomats and government officials,
Crocker said the agreement was a ``case study of superpower efforts
to support solutions to regional conflicts.''
   South Africa had declared its agreement to a 10-year-old U.N.
independence plan, but was backed by the United States in linking it
to a withdrawal of Cubans. They arrived in 1975 to back the dominant
Marxists against South African and pro-West factions.
   In Namibia's capital, Windhoek, political figures said they
looked forward to April 1 with cautious optimism.
   ``April Fool's Day. I don't trust that date. But we'll accept
it,'' said Andreas Shipanga, the black Namibian who chairs the
Cabinet of the transitional government.
   Shipanga said the South Africans had not given the transitional
government advance warning of the independence date.
   He said he hoped the date ``would not appear and disappear like
so many others. We cannot continue in a state of limbo. It is
destroying the country and the morale of our people.''
   Ben Ulenga, leader of the pro-independence National Union of
Namibian Workers, said Namibians would remain skeptical about
independence until the ``last South African troops leave the
country.''

   Teams of Austrian dogs scouring the rubble
in Armenia for earthquake survivors can no longer go on because
their paws are cut by glass and stone, reports said today.
   Newspapers quoted Austrian rescue workers in Armenia as saying
the dogs had guided rescuers to at least four survivors in ruins in
Leninakan, Armenia's second largest city.
   At present, there are 154 Austrians helping in the search and
rescue effort in Armenia following the Dec. 7 quake. Some are from
the Austrian army and Red Cross and have been working in Leninakan
along with 20 dogs they brought with them, the Vienna daily Der
Standard said.
   Gerhard Lobenschegg, leader of the Red Cross team in Leninakan,
said all dogs there would have to stop working because of the damage
to their paws.
   A 49-man private team with 40 dogs was working in Spitak, a city
virtually destroyed by the quake, Der Standard said. It quoted the
group as saying dogs can be used for a maximum of only a week at a
time before they are exhausted and must be replaced.
   About 150 Austrian soldiers will probably fly to Yerevan this
week, the Defense Ministry said.

<HEAD>Woman Claims To Be Anonymous Plaintiff In Abortion Legalization
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman claiming to be the anonymous plaintiff in
one of two U.S. Supreme Court cases that legalized abortion in 1973
has petitioned a federal court to unseal case records in order to
help reverse the ruling.
   In an interview Monday with The Atlanta Constitution, she said
she wants to be able to prove her identity as the plaintiff to give
her anti-abortion work credibility.
   ``Mary Doe didn't want an abortion. Mary Doe didn't have an
abortion. Mary Doe won't ever have an abortion,'' said the Atlanta
woman, who was not identified by name in the interview.
   In the petition filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta
without the assistance of an attorney, she requested to be ``allowed
to open the envelope with the true identity of Mary Doe, being I am
Mary Doe.''
   The petition said her name at the time of the case was Sandra Kay
Race Bensing, according to the petition. Now 40, she has since
married twice.
   Records containing the identity of the anonymous plaintiff can be
unsealed only by a judge's order.
   Atlanta lawyer Margie Pitts Hames, who represented ``Mary Doe''
before the Supreme Court, was in London on Monday and could not be
reached for comment.
   She said before the petition was filed: ``I'm not prepared to
talk to anybody about Mary Doe's identity. We took great steps to
see that her identity was kept confidential.''
   Ms. Hames said she lost touch with the plaintiff and has been
trying to locate her for six years.
   No hearing has been set on the woman's request to open the file,
which was sealed at Ms. Hames' request.
   The newspaper reported in today's editions that the woman said
participating in the case was the biggest mistake she ever made. She
said she opposes abortion and hopes the Supreme Court ruling can be
reversed.
   ``I decided from the very beginning I would never consent to an
abortion,'' she said. ``I'm not a religious person but I believe in
God. I know he's real. I know we don't take lives.''
   She said that even after the Supreme Court ruling, she continued
her pregnancy and gave up her newborn daughter for adoption.
   The ruling in the Georgia case, Doe vs. Bolton _ referring to
then-state Attorney General Arthur K. Bolton _ was handed down by
the Supreme Court on Jan. 22, 1973.
   The court said Georgia's conditions for abortions were too
restrictive, that medical committees were unnecessary to approve
abortions and that the state could not prohibit abortions outside
accredited hospitals.
   The case was overshadowed by Roe vs. Wade, a Texas case ruled on
the same day. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down Texas'
abortion law as a violation of a woman's right to privacy.

   A gunman shot to death two taxi drivers and
injured a third in a series of robbery attacks in Killeen and a
nearby Army base, police said.
   One of the Yellow Cab drivers was shot to death and another was
bitten on the hand and forehead in this central Texas town, while
the third was shot to death at nearby Fort Hood, police said.
   The incidents began Monday night and continued until early today,
said authorities, who did not immediately release names of the
victims.
   The assailant, who was described to police by the wounded driver,
called a taxi to take him from Killeen to the Army post. Inside the
post, the man robbed the driver and shot him to death.
   The man then called a Yellow Cab to take him from Fort Hood to
Killeen. He again robbed the driver and shot him to death on a
street in the central Texas town.
   A short time later, a third driver said a man attempted to rob
him and shot at him on a Killeen street.
   The driver grabbed the gunman's hand, forcing the bullet to go
out the car window and miss the driver, said a Yellow Cab dispatcher
in Killeen who would not identify himself. The gunman then bit the
driver on the hand and forehead, the dispatcher said.
   The driver was treated at a hospital and released, said James
Kelly, an investigator with the Killeen Police Department.
   Authorities say they do not know how much money was taken in the
robberies.
   State and military officers were investigating the shootings.

   Toe-tingling arctic air lingered over the East today, but a
reprieve was in sight from the season's first big chill, which
contributed to at least six deaths, stalled cars and burst pipes
from the Great Lakes to the South.
   The deep freeze taxed utilities, filled shelters for the homeless
and gave some students a holiday when furnaces quit or buses froze.
Schools were closed today in more than a dozen Kentucky counties
because of snow-slickened roads.
   The subzero cold today set a record for the date in Albany, N.Y.,
where a reading of minus 5 exceeded the minus 1 record set in 1960.
   On Monday, records for the date were set in 25 cities.
   Temperatures were expected to warm into the 30s by Wednesday as a
weather system nudges the arctic air east, said meterologist Brian
Smith at the National Weather Service's Severe Storms Forecast
Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   By this morning, temperatures already had started rising. In
Providence, R.I., it was 24 degrees at 9 a.m. Monday's high
temperature was 20 degrees.
   The warming trend wasn't enough for police in Burrillville, north
of Providence, however. The station's six water pipes froze Monday,
said Chief Wallace F. Lees. One pipe burst, flooding some rooms.
   ``There are still five (pipes) we haven't got thawed out,'' he
said this morning. ``We can't incarcerate any people because of the
cold conditions.''
   Many people took the cold in stride, pausing only to yank on an
extra sweater or dig out a winter cap.
   Elizabeth Vrotkoski and Mary Dobranski worked non-stop Monday
selling cold weather gear at Boscov's department store in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where it dropped to minus 5 degrees. By
midafternoon, the women said they had sold 119 pairs of gloves, 40
scarves and 48 pairs of slippers.
   ``We've always had cold weather here, so it's nothing new to
us,'' said Wilma Kuebler, a receptionist at the Emmet County airport
just north of Pellston in northern Michigan, where the temperature
dropped to minus 16 Monday.
   ``Other than a door freezing shut, it hasn't stopped us,'' she
said.
   In Buffalo, N.Y., where it was a record minus 9 degrees Monday,
William Doss' beard was frozen when he reached his downtown office.
``Take my advice: It's best not to get too worked up about the
temperature this early in the season,'' he said.
   The cold brought the plight of the homeless to the forefront, but
some stayed away from shelters and sought cover in subways, parks or
makeshift structures on city streets.
   ``The worst people stay in those shelters,'' said Eli, a
48-year-old homeless man in New York City who wouldn't give his last
name. ``You're better off to stay in the subway because at least
there's police there.''
   In Philadelphia, dozens of homeless people erected a cardboard
city in a subway station four blocks from City Hall.
   In New York City, two men thought to be homeless have been found
dead since Sunday, one on a street, the other in a park. Police said
the cold may have been a factor in the deaths. And a woman found in
a subway station was believed by police to have died of a
combination of a drug overdose and the cold.
   In Baltimore, a house fire killed a woman in her 60s early
Monday. The house had no electricity, and police said the woman
apparently was using candles for heat and light.
   Officials in Luzerne County, Pa., ruled the death of a woman
found on her porch was hypothermia. And at least two other deaths,
both in traffic accidents, in Pennsylvania were attributed to the
weather.
   An 84-year-old woman who survived 2{ hours in an icy 3-foot deep
creek after falling down a 25-foot cliff while feeding birds in
10-degree weather was in stable condition today in northeast Ohio.
   Jesse Norton of Chardon was pulled to safety Monday by a rescue
crew called by a visiting nurse who checks on the woman.
   Light snow fell today in the Great Lakes region and moved
eastward into Pennsylvania, a welcome sight for ski slope operators,
who already were using snow-making equipment in the subzero cold.
   ``We're making a ton of snow,'' said William Ulinski,
superintendent of the Mount Sunapee ski area in Newbury, N.H.
   And two members of the Iceberg Athletic Club plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean off New York's Coney Island for a seven-minute dip
Monday afternoon.
   ``Feel great,'' said the 73-year-old president, Vick Boff. ``It
just makes you feel wonderful. It's something that you actually have
to experience in order to appreciate it.''

   President-elect Bush won't name any members of
Congress to his Cabinet because he doesn't want to weaken his party
in the House or Senate, both already controlled by the Democrats,
Bush aides said today.
   ``We decided it wasn't fair to deplete our strength in
Congress,'' said Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller.
   Transition spokeswoman Alixe Glen added, ``Many of the vice
president's friends in Congress have indicated a willingness to
serve in his administration. Their appointment would mean a loss of
strong supporters on Capitol Hill.''
   Bush began telephoning and sending notes late Monday to members
of Congress who had been under consideration for various posts,
aides to Bush and several congressmen said.
   Fuller said he expected ``a couple'' of appointments to the new
administration later this week, but he wouldn't specify which
offices would be filled.
   He indicated that background checks are continuing on former Sen.
John Tower of Texas, the leading candidate for defense secretary,
and said the timing of an announcement on Bush's Pentagon chief was
``completely up in the air.''
   Bush, meanwhile, was meeting today with Coretta Scott King, the
widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   The private meeting is one of a series Bush has had with
prominent black leaders, including former Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Hooks of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Bush has yet to appoint a black to a high-level job in his
administration, although he has promised his Cabinet will reflect
the makeup of the American public.
   Bush also was scheduled today to talk with Carlos Andres Perez,
the president-elect of Venezuela. Perez is the sixth foreign leader
_ the third from Latin America _ that Bush has entertained since the
election Nov. 8.
   On Monday, Bush's transition aides interviewed Peter Johnson, a
former head of the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland,
Ore., about the job of energy secretary.
   ``I feel good about it,'' Johnson said of the meeting. But he
said Craig Fuller, the co-director of the transition, and Chase
Untermeyer, the head of personnel, gave him no indication whether he
was a finalist for the job.
   Among others mentioned for the Department of Energy post, former
Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana, is thought to be a leading contender.
   Another name surfaced Monday for the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency: Elizabeth Dole.
   Mrs. Dole, the former transportation secretary and the wife of
Senate Minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was known to have been
interested in the post of ambassador to the United Nations. Bush
picked Thomas Pickering, a career diplomat, for that job, but said
he would like to find something suitable for Mrs. Dole.
   So far, Bush has placed only one woman, Carla Hills, in a high
position. She was nominated to be the U.S. trade representative.
   Another woman, Constance Horner, the head of the Office of
Personnel Management, is considered a strong candidate for labor
secretary. John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation
of Government Employees, says it will not try to block Horner's
appointment if she is willing to speak openly with the unions.
   Another woman candidate for the labor job, Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., appears to be out of the running because of Bush's decision
on not naming members of Congress.
   The big hole in Bush's national security lineup is the defense
secretary. Tower of Texas is still said by sources to be the
favorite for the job, although the FBI has yet to finish checks into
his background.
   Sources close to Tower say the FBI could complete its work this
week, but any announcement might be delayed if Bush decides to name
a full slate at the Defense Department, rather than just the
secretary.
   But the sources also said that transition staff members have told
Tower he will have much to say in choosing his own aides, if he is
awarded the defense secretary's slot.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry has canceled the city's
annual downtown New Year's Eve celebration, citing a drug and crime
epidemic and budget problems.
   ``I think we're in serious times now, with the crime being what
it is and the drug epidemic. It's no time to celebrate, it's a time
to work hard and to pray,'' he said in a radio interview Monday
night.
   Barry had boasted in 1986 that the nation's capital celebration
would surpass New York City's celebration in Times Square and become
a major tourist attraction in the revitalized downtown Pennsylvania
Avenue corridor.
   The city began the street celebration in 1983. But the 1986 event
sparked criticism after the strangled, partially clad body of a high
school student was found in a remote stairwell at the Old Post
Office Pavilion.
   That slaying, along with 15 arrests and reports of fighting and
bottle throwing, led Barry to change the entertainment at the bash,
emphasizing family fare.
   In the past two years, the city moved to ensure safety at the
celebration by limiting alcohol sales, adding police protection and
changing the musical program.
   Last January, officials said more than 100,000 people attended
the party, far short of the estimated 1 million people who crowd
Times Square.
   As of today, 347 homicides had been reported in the District of
Columbia so far this year. Police have estimated 60 percent are
drug-related. The previous high was 287 in 1969.
   Barry has said the city faces a $150 million budget deficit. He
is scheduled to tell the City Council on Wednesday how he plans to
solve the problem.
   In the radio interview on WHUR, Barry said ``we want to emphasize
family values and a number of other things. And people ought to stay
home.... Those who are churchgoing people ought to go to watch
services.''
   D.C. Council member John A. Wilson, whose ward includes downtown,

   Wilson added, ``He doesn't want to be accused of wasting money
right now.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry has canceled the city's
annual downtown New Year's Eve celebration, citing a drug and crime
epidemic and budget problems.
   ``I think we're in serious times now, with the crime being what
it is and the drug epidemic. It's no time to celebrate, it's a time
to work hard and to pray,'' he said in a radio interview Monday
night.
   Barry had boasted in 1986 that the nation's capital celebration
would surpass New York City's celebration in Times Square and become
a major tourist attraction in the revitalized downtown Pennsylvania
Avenue corridor.
   The city began the street celebration in 1983. But the 1986 event
sparked criticism after the strangled, partially clad body of a high
school student was found in a remote stairwell at the Old Post
Office Pavilion.
   That slaying, along with 15 arrests and reports of fighting and
bottle throwing, led Barry to change the entertainment at the bash,
emphasizing family fare.
   In the past two years, the city moved to ensure safety at the
celebration by limiting alcohol sales, adding police protection and
changing the musical program.
   Last January, officials said more than 100,000 people attended
the party, far short of the estimated 1 million people who crowd
Times Square.
   As of today, 347 homicides had been reported in the District of
Columbia so far this year. Police have estimated 60 percent are
drug-related. The previous high was 287 in 1969.
   Barry has said the city faces a $150 million budget deficit. He
is scheduled to tell the City Council on Wednesday how he plans to
solve the problem.
   In the radio interview on WHUR, Barry said ``we want to emphasize
family values and a number of other things. And people ought to stay
home.... Those who are churchgoing people ought to go to watch
services.''
   D.C. Council member John A. Wilson, whose ward includes downtown,
said he areed with Barry.
   ``I think he's also starting to prepare people for the
difficulties we're going to have next year because we're going to
have major financial problems,'' said Wilson, chairman of the
council's finance committee.
   Wilson added, ``He doesn't want to be accused of wasting money
right now.''

<HEAD>Parents' Request to Supervise Own Children Denied by State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of 52 children who state
officials say were systematically beaten at a religious camp must
admit their children were abused before the state will consider
returning them, an official says.
   ``We need to hear from the parents a recognition that the
children have been abused,'' said Bart Wilson, Clackamas branch
manager for the state Children's Services Division. ``Our assessment
is that the parents have not yet recognized that.''
   The division Monday also denied the parents' request to serve as
unpaid state volunteers to be near their sons and daughters until
custody is determined.
   The children were taken into state custody immediately after the
Oct. 14 death of 8-year-old Dayna Lorea Broussard, daughter of
Ecclesia Athletic Association founder Eldridge Broussard Jr.
   Four members of her father's organization are awaiting trial on
manslaughter charges resulting from the girl's death at a rural
house southeast of Portland. Broussard also ran the Watts Christian
Center in Los Angeles.
   The other children said they were forced to watch the Broussard
girl's beating, and some were forced to count the blows. They said
beatings with electrical cords and paddles routinely occurred at the
house.
   One parent, Jewell Benefield of Los Angeles, had said earlier
that the children ``are world-class athletes in training, and they
can do things that normal kids can't do,'' such as thousands of
push-ups daily.
   Benefield's comments echoed similar claims Broussard made about
the children, leading state officials to question the control the
association founder maintains over the parents.
   Wilson said his agency needs the parents to make ``clear
assurances that if the children are returned to their custody that
the abuse would not reoccur.''
   The state Monday also denied a request that Broussard be allowed
to make ministerial visits to the children in state custody. He
claims to have been ordained a minister in the Church of God in
Christ in 1976.
   Broussard, however, will be allowed to continue his visits to his
own four children now in custody, Wilson said. Other parents have
been making hour-long visits each week, he added.
   Eighteen of the children are housed at juvenile facilities and 33
in foster homes, Wilson said. An 18-month-old boy was released to
his parents and grandparents in California for an extended but
temporary visit.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Marcos Will Remain Hospitalized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has
weak heart muscles and will remain hospitalized for further tests,
his doctors say.
   The 71-year-old Marcos was admitted Friday to St. Francis Medical
Center suffering from what aides called congestive heart failure. He
was listed in stable condition today.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, said his spirits were lifted by visits over
the weekend from tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a friend of the couple,
and Ms. Duke's newly adopted daughter, Charlene Gail ``Chandi''
Heffner.
   ``He seems to come alive,'' when Duke visits, said Mrs. Marcos.
``She is a good American Samaritan and has saved my faith in this
country. Doris inspires the president; she is an angel from heaven,
a remarkable woman who places a high value on friendship.''
   Duke, who owns a home here, recently provided $5 million bail for
Mrs. Marcos when the former Philippine first lady was arraigned in
New York on federal racketeering charges.
   Marcos, ousted as Philippine president in February 1986 by
Corazon Aquino, faces the same charges, but he and his lawyers
contend he is too frail to travel to New York for arraignment.
   Marcos has weakened heart muscles and was prone to develop
congestive heart failure, according to a statement released Monday
by Dr. Calvin Wong, a Honolulu cardiologist.
   ``These episodes in the past have been treated in his home as an
outpatient. ... Because of increased stress that he has been under,
doctors felt it prudent for Mr. Marcos to be hospitalized in order
to re-evaluate his cardiac condition and to readjust his
medication,'' Wong's statement said.
   Marcos has responded to treatment and his condition has
stabilized but he would not be released pending neurological tests,
Wong said.
   A St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman who read the statement
refused to elaborate on it.
   A New York physician who examined Marcos here in October said
then that although Marcos suffered various ailments, he was well
enough to travel to New York. Dr. Francis Weld of Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital also concluded that Marcos faked pain during
the court-ordered examination.
   On Monday, Weld said that although Marcos did not have congestive
heart failure at the time of the examination, he could have
developed it since. He said the ailment can be either acute or
chronic.
   Mrs. Marcos dismissed accusations that her husband was faking
illness.
   ``The president would be the first one in New York if he could
travel,'' she said.
   Mrs. Marcos said she was so worried about her husband's safety
that she tasted his hospital food and medicine to make sure it was
not poisoned.
   ``I admit it; I am kind of scared, paranoid,'' she said. ``Are
these not desperate times?''

<TEXT>
   Former Miss America Bess Myerson tried to ``buy
justice'' when she gave a city job to the daughter of the judge
making rulings in her lover's divorce, a federal prosecutor charged
today.
   In closing arguments at U.S. District Court, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Stuart Abrams said Miss Myerson and her millionaire
boyfriend plotted to influence former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel through her daughter.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, it's not a complicated case,'' said
Abrams. ``It's very simple _ it's a very simple scheme.''
   Abrams said Miss Myerson and boyfriend Carl ``Andy'' Capasso
decided ``the way to push (Mrs. Gabel's) buttons, to get out of her
what they wanted was through her daughter.''
   The prosecution, which began its case in early October, was
scheduled to address the jury all day. The case is expected to go to
the jury, which heard 10 weeks of testimony, next Monday.
   Miss Myerson, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is
accused of trying to influence a judge's rulings in the divorce of
her lover by giving a city job to the judge's daughter.
   Miss Myerson, 64, Capasso, 43, and Mrs. Gabel, 75, who made
interim rulings in Capasso's bitter divorce, are charged with
conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges.
   Miss Myerson, who was Miss America 1945, is also charged with
obstruction of justice. She faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in
prison if convicted of all charges.
   Her two co-defendants face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.
   Last week, the prosecution rested its case, which is based on
circumstantial evidence, after calling 34 witnesses. The defense
rested the next day, calling just five witnesses.
   The defendants did not testify.
   Prosecution witnesses testified that Miss Myerson made secret
phone calls to the judge's chambers, sometimes using an assumed
name. Jurors heard how she suddenly became socially close to the
judge and her family after two decades of a distant professional
acquaintance.
   There also was evidence about the hiring of the judge's daughter,
Sukhreet Gabel, in August 1983 a few months after she met Miss
Myerson for the first time, and how Capasso's temporary support
payments to his estranged wife, Nancy, were cut the following month
from $1,850 a week to $850 a week.
   There hasn't been much said about Capasso, a one-time
multimillionaire city contractor.
   The main evidence against him was testimony by his former
housekeeper, Shirley Harrod, who said Miss Myerson and Capasso were
``very upset'' about the payments Capasso had to make to his
estranged wife.
   Mrs. Harrod testified that she later saw Capasso throw down
documents that looked like divorce papers and say to Miss Myerson:
``Isn't there something you can do about this?''
   But on cross-examination, Mrs. Harrod conceded she was not sure
what Capasso and Miss Myerson were discussing and that she only
surmised that what Capasso threw down were his divorce papers.
   Capasso is serving a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion.
   Capasso's lawyer, Jay Goldberg, asked for an acquittal last week,
claiming the government's case was held together ``by nothing more
secure than a rope of sand.'' The judge refused.

<TEXT>
   On the seventh anniversary of the
declaration of martial law and suppression of the Solidarity trade
movement, students chanting ``Solidarity!'' pelted police with
stones today and were answered with tear gas during a protest at
Warsaw University.
   Meanwhile, the official press defended the imposition of martial
law on Dec. 13, 1981, by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   About 2,000 students faced several hundred shield-carrying,
helmeted police today at the gates of Warsaw University along one of
the city's main thouroughfares.
   Students hoisted banners saying ``Solidarity'' and ``There is no
freedom without Solidarity'' and threw stones at the police from
behind the walls of the campus. Police answered with canisters of
tear gas.
   At least three people were detained, according to Zuzanna
Dabrowska, a student activist.
   In a commentary on martial law, the Communist Party daily Trybuna
Ludu said: ``One can remember Dec. 13th for years with a measure of
bitterness and divisions. One can open the healing wounds anew.''
   On that Sunday morning in 1981, Poles awoke to find tanks in the
streets, martial music playing on the radio and thousands of
Solidarity members rounded up and interned.
   The army put an overnight end to the legal operation of
Solidarity, a 10 million-member social movement that had electrified
the country for 15 months. Solidarity was at first suspended, then
legally banned in October 1982.
   Little bloodshed accompanied the imposition of martial law, but
nine coal miners were killed during a strike at the Wujek mine near
Katowice on Dec. 16, 1981. No other casualties were reported.
   ``The anniversary ... cannot be an occasion for celebrations but
can and should be a cause for reflection,'' said Trybuna Ludu.
   A government statement published in most newspapers today said
the decision to impose martial law ``not only helped to prevent
national catastrophe but to defend this (reformatory) process from
those who _ often without being fully aware of it _ were preparing a
tragic conclusion to it.
   ``Dictated by a supreme necessity, the events of Dec. 13, 1981,
did not stop the process of democratization and broad reforms ...
Under conditions of order not anarchy, businesslike discussion not
sterile disputes, the sense of socialist renewal was restored.''
   Alluding to Solidarity and others in the opposition, the
statement said the Communist Party's offer for national
reconciliation has not always been accepted.
   ``Some circles continue to stand aside from talks, distrustfully
or reluctantly viewing a proposal to assume co-responsibility for
state affairs.''
   Solidarity, although still illegal, has been increasingly
tolerated by authorities, who have been hoping to lure its leader,
Lech Walesa, to discussions on Poland's future. But the proposed
talks with the government have stalled, with Walesa insisting he
first wants a signal that authorities are willing to legalize his
union.
   The union demonstrated it has a strong following after leading
two waves of strikes in 1988.
   On Nov. 30, authorities allowed Walesa to participate in a
nationwide TV debate with official union chief Alfred Miodowicz, and
Walesa was widely considered to have won the debate.
   Solidarity plans ceremonies Friday in Gdansk, where the trade
union was born, to honor the victims of Dec. 16, 1970, food riots
along the Baltic Coast and the miners killed resisting martial law.

<TEXT>
   Tests have found no dangerous substances in
the air at the headquarters of USA Today, where 14 workers are said
to have suffered miscarriages in the last 15 months, the paper's
editor says.
   Editor Peter S. Prichard said Monday that the preliminary results
were provided by an outside testing firm that tested newsrooms at
USA Today's Arlington headquarters over the last two weeks.
   He said that additional testing will be done.
   USA Today employees said last week that an informal survey found
that 14 women who work on the 14th and 15th floors of the building
had suffered miscarriages since September 1987. The employees were
concerned that major remodeling which began in April contributed to
several of the miscarriages.
   ``We're continuing to look at it,'' Prichard told The Washington
Post. ``We don't know the cause (of the miscarriages) and we're
continuing to try to find out.''
   Prichard told employees of the preliminary test results at a
meeting Monday. He also said other floors at the newspaper, owned by
Gannett Co. Inc., will be tested and that an epidemiologist has been
hired to study the cluster of miscarriages.
   In a memo summarizing the results, Prichard said the
environmental firm found the air ``is cleaner than the air in most
buildings.''
   A memo last week signed by Madelyn P. Jennings, USA Today's
senior vice president for personnel, said the newspaper will also
test the effects of video display terminals used by employees.

   Roy Orbison's widow has established a
memorial fund in the singer's name for a private arts school
attended by one of his sons.
   ``Roy said often he did not like funerals, and the other thing is
he did not like turning events into a zoo,'' spokeswoman Sarah
McMullen said Monday. ``But we do not want the fans to feel ignored.
We feel this memorial fund will keep alive the generous, humane
qualities of Roy Orbison.''
   The Crossroads School trains students in kindergarten through
grade 12 in the arts and offers scholarships to minority children.
   Orbison's son, Roy Kelton, attends the school and another son,
Alexander, is due to attend next year, according to Barbara Orbison,
the singer's widow. ``The world knows Roy through the gifts of his
voice and his songwriting, but as a private man he was very much a
family man,'' she said.
   At a memorial service Sunday in Gallatin, Tenn., 75 of Orbison's
friends attended a 30-minute tribute where he was eulogized as a
legendary performer with a worldwide following.
   A private memorial service was scheduled today in Los Angeles.
   Meanwhile, the late singer's 1955 Cadillac convertible, featured
in his ``Class of '55'' music video, will be auctioned in Florida by
a classic car auction company.
   David Rupp, a northern Indiana sponsor of the Miami Beach auction
Dec. 30-Jan. 1, said he bought the baby blue Cadillac a few weeks
before Orbison died.
   Orbison's Caddy could bring bids of more than $100,000, twice the
value of an identical restored model with no celebrity connection,
said Mitchell D. Kruse, president of Kruse International, based in
Auburn, Ind.
   Orbison, whose recording career spanned 30 years, died of a heart
attack Dec. 6 at 52.
   He was best known for his 1960s hits and his three-octave voice
which ranged through such songs as ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the
Lonely'' and ``Crying.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorneys general of New York and New Jersey
_ where beaches were littered by medical waste and other pollution
last summer _ have presented an anti-pollution plan they hope will
become a blueprint for a national program.
   Cary Edwards of New Jersey and Robert Abrams of New York said
Monday that the Bush administration will have to lead an aggressive
attack if the nation's oceans and beaches are to be cleaned up.
   ``The president-elect said he was going to do things differently
than the present administration,'' said Abrams. ``He said he was
going to do more vigorous enforcement. We are going to push for this
agenda. Our role is to be the people's advocate.''
   The two officials said attorneys general from around the country
would lobby for the plan, ``A Blueprint to End Ocean Pollution,'' to
be adopted as comprehensive national anti-pollution program. The
plan was issued by the National Association of Attorneys General,
which Abrams heads.
   ``We once felt the oceans were so big we could not destroy them,
but we're now realizing that's not the case,'' said Abrams.
   Added Edwards, ``Anybody who thinks they can stop the dumping of
syringes and they're going to clean up the ocean, they're crazy.''
   Edwards said his investigation into the source of debris that
turned up on the Jersey shore in the summers of 1987 and 1988 found
that ``there was no mad dumper. The mad dumper was the American
lifestyle.
   ``The federal government and the EPA must weigh in on the
problem,'' he added. ``It can't be dealt with alone by any
individual states.''
   The blueprint offers proposals to:
   _Upgrade sewage treatment plants.
   _Remove toxins from industrial waste water.
   _Promote recycling.
   _Control runoff from fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals.
   _Expand research on water quality.
   _Increase Coast Guard surveillance to prevent ocean dumping.
   _Aggressively enforce existing anti-pollution laws.
   Edwards said a top priority was ending sewage overflow, or the
dumping of raw or poorly treated sewage into bodies of water when
sewage treatment plants are overwhelmed by the volume of waste water
during storms.
   Ending the dumping of sewage sludge at sea is another priority,
the two men said.

   A Palestinian grabbed a gun from a Jewish
settler in the West Bank today and killed the settler and another
Israeli before he was shot to death by Israeli soldiers, Israeli
sources said.
   The shootings occurred in the Arab village of Burin near the
settlement of Berakha about the time PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was
speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva.
   Arab sources said the Palestinian was a shepherd identified as
Hamdan Najjar, 25. They said he had been grazing his flock of sheep
near the Jewish settlement. The Arab and Israeli sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   An army spokesman confirmed the settler was killed on his way
home to Berakha when an Arab man seized his gun and shot him. The
spokesman said an army patrol arrived at the scene of the attack and
fatally shot the Palestinian.
   The spokesman declined to elaborate or say whether there were
other casualties.
   Before today, 322 Palestinians and 11 Israelis had died in the
year-old revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Thousands of Arabs have been wounded, among them many
children.
   Arab residents said Jewish settlers entered Burin earlier today
and went into several schools, ordering teachers and students to
leave. One high school principal was beaten, residents said.
   
   A curfew was imposed on the village, Arab journalists said.
   Also today, a Jewish settler today shot and wounded a 26-year-old
Arab after his car was stoned in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, and
troops shot and wounded a 10-year-old boy in the Tulkarem refugee
camp, Arab reports said. An army spokeswoman said she was checking
the reports.
   The army increased its forces in the occupied territories today
and clamped a curfew on the Gaza Strip in an effort to prevent
violence during Arafat's speech.
   Soldiers used loudspeakers to warn the Gaza Strip's 650,000
residents to stay indoors and not violate the curfew, an Arab
reporter said.
   ``We are imposing a curfew ... and we will open fire on anyone
who breaks it,'' the troops announced.
   Despite the heavy military patrols, Gaza City residents used
helium-filled balloons to set aloft a giant Palestinian flag and
burned tires in the streets, according to an Arab journalist in the
city.
   Telephone lines to refugee camps in the Gaza Strip were cut off,
Palestinian sources in Gaza said.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, about 100 Palestinian women held
an illegal march to show support for Arafat. They carried banned
Palestinian flags and banners saying ``My homeland is Palestine.''
   ``No to the occupation _ Long live Palestine,'' they chanted.
   In Bethlehem, Arabs stocked up on batteries for tape recorders
and radios so they could listen to Arafat's speech, shopowners said.
   An Arab reporter said the residents feared Israel might cut off
electricity in the territories during the speech, as authorities did
in November when Arafat addressed the Palestine National Council in
Algiers and declared an independent Palestinian state.
   Hundreds of additional police were deployed in Arab east
Jerusalem and the army added extra patrols to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, anticipating violent demonstrations following Arafat's speech.
   In east Jerusalem, police used tear gas to break up a crowd of
elementary school children who blocked the entrance to their school
with rocks and raised banned Palestinian flags, the national Itim
news agency reported.
   A similar confrontation took place near the walled Old City, Itim
said. The clashes followed several days of increased protests in the
Israeli-annexed sector, which generally has been calm during the
uprising.
   Three Arab schools in the city were ordered closed until Sunday,
affecting over 2,000 students.
   The increased patrols in east Jerusalem were also apparently
linked to a firebombing Monday in which six people, including an
American woman, were injured.
   An assailant hurled a firebomb at an Israeli passenger bus
driving along east Jerusalem's main commercial thoroughfare, causing
it to slam into a wall and a parked car, police said.
   Among the injured was Salwa Kanana, from Wisconsin. Police did
not know her hometown.

<HEAD>Persistence of Deficit Laid to `Iron Triangle'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan charged in a speech summing up
his administration's record on domestic policy today that an ``iron
triangle'' of members of Congress, the news media and special
interest groups have helped perpetuate the budget deficit.
   Reagan received a tumultuous reception, with applause punctuated
by cheers and whistles, from his audiences of government officials
and employees in Constitution Hall.
   ``One of my great disappointments as I leave office is that the
federal budget itself is not yet balanced,'' the president said.
   ``It sometimes seems to many Americans that what might be called
a triangle of institutions, parts of Congress, the media and
interest groups is transforming and placing out of focus our
constitutional balance, particularly in the areas of spending, and
placing out of focus our constitutional balance, particularly in the
areas of spending and foreign policy,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan noted that some had used the term ``iron triangle'' to
describe this complex, and said he would borrow the phrase.
   ``Administrations come and go, but the iron triangle remains,''
he said.
   ``The House of Representatives, he said, ``has become a virtually
permament chamber no longer truly responsive to the people.''
   ``With a 98 per cent rate of re-election, there is less turnover
in the House than in the Supreme Soviet.''
   The president said the ``iron triangle'' also derives from the
power of special interest groups to ``focus debate and overwhelming
resources like campaign money and letter-writing campaigns on issues
that don't command broad and intense national attention.''
   With this pressure, he said, liberal members of Congress ``take
up the banner'' in support of continued spending programs.
   ``You would think the media might act as a check on all this,''
he said. ``But too often it doesn't.''
   While expressing respect for the news media, Reagan said that
``too many members of the media approach issues like federal
spending from a superficial perspective.''
   ``Our positions are reported in caricature,'' he said. ``Special
interest charges are reported uncritically, and the public's
understanding suffers.''
   ``Shouldn't we expect better of those who act in the name of the
public's right to know?'' the president asked.
   His audience cheered the question.

<TEXT>
   Mud around the Battleship Texas was
keeping the historic vessel from taking its first voyage since 1948,
a tow up the Houston Ship Channel to a Galveston dry dock for
restoration, officials said today.
   Five tugboats with a combined 16,000 horsepower rocked the Texas
back and forth this morning to try to dislodge it from its 40-year
berth.
   But four hours later, the 27-ton national landmark remained mired
in the impression it left in the mud at the San Jacinto Battleground
State Park, said naval architect Edwin Phillips.
   ``We've moved about 25 or 30 feet but it hasn't been a great big
bite,'' Phillips said. ``But eventually she'll come.''
   The Texas, the only surviving U.S. combat ship to have served in
both world wars, is scheduled to undergo a $5.1 million restoration.
   The 40-mile trip to the Todd Shipyard in Galveston is expected to
take 10-12 hours, said Sue Moss, the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department project historian for the battleship.
   ``In my judgment we would have very severe long-term problems
with the ship if we didn't repair her now. We have had a history of
leaks in the ship, some in the piping system, but some also in hull
penetration caused by corrosion,'' said Wilson Dolman, director of
parks.
   He said several pumps were placed in the ship in case a leak
erupts during towing.
   The restoration is designed to return the ship to its appearance
during its last commissioned service, in the Pacific Theater during
World War II.
   The Texas is toured by about 200,000 visitors a year.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 800 people turned out for a ceremony
in memory of people killed in drunken driving accidents, including
one that took 27 lives from this community.
   As the names of victims were read out Monday, relatives and
friends stepped to a table, lighted a candle and took a red
carnation.
   Similar services also were held the same day in Louisville and in
Frankfort, where Gov. Wallace Wilkinson promised to ask the
Legislature for tougher penalties for drunken and drugged drivers.
   The vigil in Radcliff, sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk
Drivers, held special meaning this year because of the May 14 church
bus crash that killed 27 people. Authorities have charged the driver
of a pickup truck that crashed into the bus with being drunk. He
also was charged with 27 counts of murder, and is free on bond
awaiting trial.
   ``It means a lot to me that people care enough to share respect
for others who lost their lives,'' said Larry Flowers, 16, of
Radcliff, a survivor of that crash, on Interstate 71 in northern
Kentucky. ``I just wished people realized what damage they do by
drinking and driving.''
   Among those who spoke at the vigil was Christy Pearman, a
survivor of the crash. Her father, John, was driving the bus owned
by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church and was killed.
   Christy Pearman read a poem about her feelings of loss, that said
in part, ``We miss your footsteps on the stairs, we miss the way
that you combed your hair,''
   Dave Everhart, president of the Hardin County chapter of MADD,
said police, courts, the media and other professionals can't wage
the fight against drunken driving alone.
   ``When we reach enough drunk drivers to make them too aware, too
ashamed or just too afraid to get into vehicles after drinking, only
then can we feel hope for a safe future,'' he said.
   Wilkinson said he will advocate a law that would make it illegal
for anyone to operate a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of
0.10 or higher. Current law makes that level a presumption of guilt.
   A related regulation would allow law enforcement officers to
immediately suspend the license of anyone who registered a
blood-alcohol level of .10 or higher. Refusal to take a test to
establish the level would be grounds for seizure of a license.

<HEAD>DNA Test Sought By Murder Defendant Links Him To Slayings,
Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetic test sought by a man who
claimed it would prove he was innocent of killing three teen-agers
has instead linked him to the crime, a prosecutor said.
   The tests show ``the odds of it being someone other than (Ronald
Stephen) Trimboli are one in 55 billion,'' Tarrant County Assistant
District Attorney Bob Gill said.
   Trimboli, who has been jailed since December 1985, has been tried
twice in the 1985 slayings. His first trial ended in a mistrial
because of juror misconduct and his second ended in a mistrial when
jurors could not reach a verdict. No date has been set for a third
trial.
   He sought the test, which analyzes DNA, to prove he was innocent
in the stabbing deaths of Danielle Lemieux, 14, her 12-year-old
sister, Renee Lemieux, and John Paul Bradley, 17, a family friend.
   A medical examiner's report indicated Danielle Lemieux had been
raped. Tests were made on a semen stain found on a sheet, Gill said
Monday.
   Defense attorney Mike Maloney would not comment on the report,
saying he would first have to consult with Trimboli and two other
defense lawyers.
   In October, Trimboli told reporters he he had urged his lawyers
to ask for the tests. Trimboli said he agreed to the tests even
after his lawyers warned him that the results are virtually
foolproof.
   ``They said if I was guilty, it would hang me,'' Trimboli said.
``I'm innocent, so I had no fear. The truth can only help me.''

<HEAD>Hungary Taking Lead in Trimming Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary is taking the Soviet bloc lead
in trimming defense spending, and it could have up to one third of
the 62,000 Soviet troops stationed on its soil withdrawn by 1991, an
official was quoted as saying Tuesday.
   The withdrawals would go ahead under the proposals outlined by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the United Nations last
week. Hungary used the Gorbachev proposal as a cue to slash military
spending by 17 percent next year and pension off aging generals.
   Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Ferenc Karpati on Monday announced
another Soviet bloc move to smooth the path to troop reduction in
Europe, saying in a radio interview that the Warsaw Pact would
publish all data on troop strengths and armaments before new
all-European conventional force reduction talks begin.
   This would remove a major stumbling block that stalled the
15-year-old Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks in Vienna.
   The new negotiations involving the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact
nations are to begin in Vienna possibly as early as February.
   The West has insisted that Warsaw Pact troops outnumber those of
NATO and that the Soviet bloc countries have more troops than they
admit officially.
   Gorbachev announced last week that six tank divisions would be
withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany as part of a
unilateral reduction of Soviet forces by half a million men in the
next two years.
   Prior to Gorbachev's proposal, senior Hungarian officials had
said they would like to be involved in the first stage of any troop
withdrawals.
   Newspapers Tuesday quoted Matyas Szueros, foreign policy expert
of the Hungarian Communist Party, as saying that Hungary ``may play
a role of coordinator and be a testing ground in the disarmament of
conventional weapons.''
   Gorbachev's proposal will mean in the next two years, the Soviet
forces stationed in Hungary ``will be cut by a fourth, or possibly
by a third,'' Szueros said.
   This could mean about 16,000 of the 50,000 troops to be withdrawn
from the three countries would be removed from Hungary. The
Communist Party daily Npeszabadsag reported last week there are
62,000 Soviet troops in Hungary.
   ``Hungary accepted to be a testing ground for the international
inspection of the implementation of disarmament measures, and it
considers conceivable even a unilateral disarmament which fits into
the pan-European process,'' he said.
   Defense spending has become a key issue in Hungary where a $17
billion foreign debt and double digit inflation have led to lower
living standards.
   Parliamentary deputies have called for reductions of defense
spending, saying the money should go toward improving the social
network for pensioners, big families and the unemployed.
   According to independent estimates, 1.5 million of Hungary's 10.6
million population lives below the accepted $80 minimum monthly
subsistence income.
   Karpati announced that more than 50 top army officers, including
10 generals, who are over 60, will be retired as of Jan 1.
   Hungary also plans to cut its own defense spending by 17 percent
in real terms next year.
   Newspapers reported Tuesday that parliament's defense committee
heard a proposal by the government that appropriations for military
defense would be cut by nearly $100 million in 1989, a 17 percent
cut in real terms.
   Karpati would not say how large Hungarian forces are, but said
that estimates by the International Institute of Strategic Studies
estimate of 105,000 was ``reasonable.'' He said an estimate of
190,000 was too big.

<TEXT>
   A presidential advisory commission today
recommended a 50 percent pay increase for members of Congress and
similar boosts for federal judges and other top government officials
_ but only if Congress stops its members from collecting speaking
fees.
   The panel, the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial
Salaries, also recommended that the president's pay, which has been
fixed at $200,000 since 1969, be raised by Congress to about
$350,000.
   The commission chairman, Lloyd Cutler, noted that the
government's top 3,000 or so workers are paid far less than
professional athletes, and cited a list of major league baseball
salaries published in today's New York Times.
   ``More than 500 of them _ down to the .200-hitting utility
infielders _ receive more than a district court judge or a member of
Congress or a deputy secretary of state,'' Cutler said.
   The pay raises are designed to restore purchasing power of top
government workers to its level in 1969, the first year their pay
was set under the commission's advice.
   The congressional increase from $89,500 to $135,000 is also
designed to wean members of Congress from taking honoraria for
speeches to special interest groups and others.
   One commission member, former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo., said
the recommended pay level for lawmakers is ``an ample, full-time
salary, in return for which we expect Congress will outlaw all forms
of honoraria conceivable to man.''
   Cabinet secretaries' pay would go from the current $99,500 to
$155,000. U.S. District Court judges' pay would be the same as
Congress', going from $89,500 to $135,000.
   Cutler noted that federal judges ``are leaving in droves''
because they can make far more in private practice. The average top
executive branch official leaves for the private sector after 18
months. And even members of Congress are deciding not to run for
re-election because they can't afford to put their kids through
college, he said.
   While the pay of most American workers has slightly outpaced
inflation over the last two decades, average top government salaries
have eroded by 35 percent compared to inflation, he told reporters.
   The recommendations attach dollar amounts to broad principles
outlined in a draft report issued by the commission last week, in
which the panel said salaries should generally restore top
government officials' purchasing power to 1969 levels.
   The self-styled citizens lobbying group Common Cause welcomed the
recommended pay raises and in particular the recommended ban on
speaking fees. The group's president, Fred Wertheimer, said it is
important that Congress include in the ban other ways in which
special interests can funnel money to lawmakers. Otherwise, he said,
the problem will only surface in another form.
   But the National Taxpayers Union called on President Reagan to
reject the ``outrageous'' recommendations. ``This scheme was
designed to fool the voters and enrich the Congress,'' charged the
group's executive vice president, David Keating.
   As congressional salaries have been held down by political
forces, honoraria have grown, in effect making up the difference for
lawmakers who often must maintain dual homes in their states and in
Washington. Members of Congress may accept up to $2,000 per speaking
engagement, up to a limit of 40 percent of their salaries for
senators and 30 percent for House members.
   The process lends itself to abuse. Rather than waiting for
speaking invitations, ``some of my colleagues have begun to ask
people for them,'' giving the appearance of shaking down special
interest groups, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   ``Others have begun to broker them. They'll say, `I can get you
an honorarium, breakfast for $1,000,'' Frank said. ``People
understand that it looks bad, and that in some cases it is bad. A
pattern of abuse has begun to show up. It affects 10 percent of the
people, but that's too many.''
   The commission's formal report is due to be delivered to
President Reagan by Thursday. Reagan then can adopt the
recommendation or, as he did two years ago, modify it before
including it in his budget proposal which is sent to Congress on
Jan. 9.
   Under the law, the increase will take effect a month later, on
Feb. 8, unless both the House and Senate vote to scotch it. For 19
of those 30 days Congress will be out of session, leaving only a
limited time for opponents to act.
   During hearings in recent weeks the panel, which by law meets
every four years to review the government's top salary structure,
heard testimony that relatively low pay levels were making it
difficult to recruit and keep talented people in the executive
branch, on the federal bench and in Congress.
   The recommendations concern the pay of all 535 members of the
House and Senate, about 1,100 judges from the Supreme Court through
U.S. district courts, and about 3,000 top executive branch workers,
including Cabinet secretaries.
   On Capitol Hill, supporters of the congressional pay raise were
working behind the scenes to dampen potential opposition and allow
it to take effect automatically in February. But a fight over the
perennially prickly issue appeared almost certain.
   ``I think we're all going to have a chance to face up to it,''
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``Some of the members
are probably home working on their speeches now.''
   Members of Congress always are reluctant to do anything that can
be seen as raising their own salaries, knowing how poorly that sits
with voters for whom the current pay seems like a lot of money.
That's why the law was crafted to let raises take effect without a
vote.
   ``Our goal would be to reaffirm our belief that a vote is a
conflict of interest,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., one of the
few lawmakers willing to lead the charge for a pay increase.
   ``Who else votes on their own salaries? Do teachers, or firemen?
We believe there is a broadly bipartisan group of people prepared to
accept the recommendation,'' Fazio said.
   When the issue last arose two years ago, the commission
recommended an increase to $135,000, which Reagan in his budget cut
to $89,500. The Senate passed a resolution rejecting even the
Reagan-modified increase, but the House delayed its vote until it
was too late to stop it.

   Army doctors were deployed to main
hospitals Tuesday, the second day of a strike by interns, health
authorities said.
   Negotiations between the state-employed interns and health
ministry officials in Harare and Bulawayo failed to reach an
agreement on pay demands and working conditions, according to a
hospital spokesman.
   Army doctors were assisting senior medical staff in four main
hospitals, and clinics were asked to send only seriously ill
patients to the hospitals, said the spokesman, who requested
anonymity. There were no reports of deaths caused by the dispute.
   About 20 army doctors were taken by military vehicles to the
Central Hospital complex in Harare late Tuesday, according to the
Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   On Monday, interns were reporting only for duty at casualty and
maternity facilities. Health authorities have refused to disclose
how many interns are involved in the strike.
   The strikers are demanding better pay and working conditions and
a review of contracts that bind them to state medical institutions
for several years.

   Taxi drivers in a northern Chinese city are in for

said Tuesday.
   Cabbies caught cussing or bilking passengers in the city of
Dalian will be forced to make public apologies in the local media
and pay heavy fines, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   The regulations, which went into effect Nov. 28, have become
popular with customers, the report said.
   In the first 10 months of this year, 200 cases of overcharging
and abuse by taxi drivers were reported in the coastal city, Xinhua
said.
   It cited one incident in which a driver overcharged two Japanese
and one Taiwanese the equivalent of $4.50 and then yelled at them
when they refused to pay.
   The driver later was fined about $143 and charged another $40 to
pay for a public radio apology. The total fine is more than double
the monthly salary of most taxi drivers in China.

   Greek and American negotiators Tuesday
began a new round of talks on U.S. bases aimed at renewing the
agreement before it ends next week.
   Government officials said the latest talks are expected to end
Thursday.
   The negotiations, which began a year ago, broke off in September
when Greece said the Hellenikon base near Athens would have to close
after the five-year accord expires Dec. 21.
   Under the present agreement, the U.S. has 17 months to shut down
the bases if a new accord is not signed.
   Hellenikon Air Force base is one of four U.S.-run bases in
Greece. The other bases are a Navy communications unit near Athens,
a Navy supply base at Souda Bay and an Air Force communications
installation on Crete.

<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three subway buffs happily finished a daylong
underground tour of New York today after passing through every one
of the city's 466 subway stations in what was said to be the longest
subway ride in U.S. history.
   The trip took 29 hours, 47 minutes and 12 seconds.
   ``This is it,'' said a triumphant Rick Temple as he and his two
friends stepped off the No. 7 train at the Main Street-Flushing
station.
   The three emerged unscathed, their trip unspoiled by muggers,
derailments or any of the other problems that have given the New
York City subway system an unsavory reputation.
   But the finish was not trouble free; they had intended to alight
at the Roosevelt Avenue station, but were forced to double back and
go to Main Street-Flushing because of service problems.
   Nor did they complete the trip as swiftly as they had hoped. When
they departed from the Jamaica-Van Wyck station at 6:20 a.m. Monday,
equipped with a camera, tape recorder, hand-warmer, books and orange
juice, they had expected to be on the rails for 27 hours.
   Temple, 28, Phil Vanner, 25, and Tom Murphy, 28, planned their
journey with careful attention to detail, including where to buy
food without passing through a turnstile.
   But they intended to limit their intake of food and drink,
explained Temple's mother, Janice, ``because there aren't too many
bathrooms in the stations, and they don't want to exit.''
   Murphy, who works days as a security guard and attends college at
night, and Temple and Vanner, who are computer analysts, got a
chance to break the record because Sunday the Transit Authority
opened three new stations in Queens, the first such additions in 20
years.
   With 466 stations and 232 miles of track, New York City's subway
system is easily the nation's largest, and by some measures _
including the number of cars and stations _ the world's largest.
   Working with schedules and maps, the three planned a route that
allowed them to pass through every station without ever leaving the
system.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the fastest trip
through the New York system is 21 hours, 8 minutes and 30 seconds,
set by Mayer Wiesen and Charles Emerson on Oct. 8, 1973.
   It is a trip many have taken, albeit when there still were only
463 stations. ``Boy Scout troops have done it to get some kind of
badge,'' reported Bob Slovak, a spokesman for the TA.
   But why, really, would anyone do such a thing? ``They were jerky

   Two additional Air Force cargo planes have been
ordered to prepare for disaster relief missions to the Soviet Union
and a Soviet plane that brought nuclear arms inspectors to the
United States earlier this week is being loaded with emergency
supplies, the Pentagon said today.
   The relief flights were scheduled as American donations to the
Soviet earthquake relief effort reached $3.2 million. President and
Mrs. Reagan say they'll make a contribution of their own.
   The Air Force said a C-141 cargo plane would leave West Germany
today for Pisa, Italy, where it will pick up relief supplies that
include blankets, gloves, hard hats and water tanks.
   That plane will then fly to the scene of the earthquake, at
Yerevan in Soviet Armenia, on Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon
added.
   A second C-141 is being loaded today at Andrews Air Force Base,
Md., outside Washington. It will carry plastic sheeting to be used
for temporary shelters and should arrive in Russia sometime on
Thursday, the Pentagon said.
   In addition to those scheduled flights, ``an IL-76 that brought
INF inspectors into Travis Air Force Base, Calif., yesterday, to
observe ground-launched cruise missile destruction ... will be
loaded with medical supplies and equipment for the return trip,''
said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``This represents a waiver of INF Treaty provisions by allowing
the Soviet aircraft to remain here an extra day to carry the cargo
out. The Red Cross in San Francisco is coordinating supplies.''
   The Soviet inspectors entered the United States at San Francisco
under terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which
requires the United States and Soviet Union to destroy all
intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear missiles in their
inventories.
   The scheduling of airlift missions came as the State Department
announced the the official U.S. contribution had grown to $825,000,
mostly in transportation costs, while private donations totaled $2.4
million, including a $1 million check hand-delivered in Moscow by
Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Hammer has been a frequent visitor to the Soviet Union and has
done business there for decades.
   Nancy Reagan, asked during a press preview of the White House
Christmas decorations whether she and the president had sent money,
replied, ``We're going to.'' She did not reveal the amount.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said worldwide
contributions to the relief effort totaled $26.1 million. A
department list showed 14 countries making donations besides the
United States. Nine of those countries have military ties with
Washington.
   Redman suggested that the American response was simply a
reflection of the magnitude of the disaster in Soviet Armenia, where
tens of thousands were believed killed and half a million made
homeless by last week's temblor.
   ``It really is a tragedy of immense proportions,'' Redman said.
The United States was a major contributor of aid to the Soviet Union
during World War II, but that relationship ended with the onset of
the Cold War.
   The Soviets are giving highest priority to donations of medical
supplies, including antibiotics and diagnostic and other clinical
equipment, Redman said. Lower priority is being given to such items
as blankets, tents and food, he said.
   According to the Pentagon, the first two plane loads of U.S.
government aid _ weighing more than 50 tons _ arrived in Yerevan,
the Armenian capital, on Sunday. On board were rations, water,
winter clothing and surgical supplies.
   Redman said a commercially chartered aircraft also arrived in
Yerevan on Sunday, consisting of, among other things, dogs and dog
handlers to help search for earthquake victims. Also aboard were
U.S. relief experts and representatives of several Armenian groups.
   The Pentagon said Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
training flights may be pressed into service because they can be
used to carry private aid without the State Department having to
reimburse the Defense Department for the costs, as is true for State
Department-ordered flights carrying government aid.

   A sperm whale washed ashore after dying,
apparently from the virus that has killed thousands of seals, news
reports said Tuesday.
   The 15-ton mammal, found beached near the port of Varberg about
340 miles southwest of Stockholm, was the 11th whale found dead in
the North Sea in less than a month, the Svenska Dagbladet daily said.
   Erling Haack of Stockholm's Museum of Natural History said
biologists were examining the 45-foot whale to establish if it died
of distemper, a virus that causes infections of the respiratory and
nervous systems and the digestive tract.
   A distemper epidemic killed more than 10,000 seals in northern
waters during the summer.
   The museum will keep the skeleton and fins of the whale, as well
as the ivory teeth, each worth about $660, Haack said.

<TEXT>
   Paintings done in France before World War II
and American works done after it dominate a major overhaul of 20th
century art at the National Gallery that opened Tuesday and will
stay a major feature of the museum for the next two years.
   The upper level of the gallery's East Building, which is
celebrating its 10th anniversary, starts with a room of paintings by
Pablo Picasso. His huge ``Family of Saltimbanques (Tumblers)'' _
nearly eight feet high _ is the first feature the visitor sees.
   Jack Cowart, curator of 20th century art, said an effort may be
made to use computer enhancement to get at a picture that Picasso
painted first on that canvas and then covered with the current one.
The picture underneath can be seen by X-rays, but present techniques
would not enable the color to be reproduced, he added.
   The upper level of the building is devoted almost entirely to
canvasses painted in France, by Henri Matisse, Andre Derain, Amedeo
Modigliani, Georges Braque, Fernand Leger and others.
   ``The Human Condition,'' by the Belgian artist Rene Magritte, was
acquired by the gallery last year and is being shown for the first
time.
   So are two ``Rock Settees,'' seats made of polished pink and
green granite by American sculptor Scott Burton. They come from
boulders unearthed in Cold Spring, Minn.
   Gallery Director J. Carter Brown also announced the gift to the
gallery of five paintings by the American artist Barnett Newman, who
died in 1970. Just below the street, the gallery's Concourse Level
has a room showing Newman's ``Stations of the Cross.''
   Other separate rooms on this level will be devoted to the
paintings of American artists Mark Rothko, Richard Diebenkorn,
Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Works by Roy
Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol share a room.
   Museum officials said the installation does not try to cover the
whole field of 20th century art.
   ``We're not here to touch every base,'' Brown said.
   He noted that the gallery's older West Building shows a
collection of earlier American paintings, much of it from before
World War II. Nan Rosenthal, also a curator of 20th century art,
pointed out that other museums in Washington specialize in work from
Africa and the Orient.
   The present installation will be kept until the end of 1990, when
the National Gallery begins to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Brown
said changes can be expected then.

   Fire broke out today in a ward at a
state penitentiary, killing 20 prisoners and injuring six, a state
official said.
   Raul Garza, state communications director, said the fire in a
ward at the Nuevo Leon state prison broke out about 3 a.m. when a
candle in a small altar to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron
saint, ignited a curtain.
   ``Yesterday (Monday) was a religious holiday to the Virgin of
Guadalupe so there were an inordinate amount of ... candles in the
dormitory to the virgin,'' Garza said in a telephone interview.
   He said the flames spread to curtains hanging from the four-level
bunk beds in the ward, which houses 116 prisoners.
   ``The mattresses also caught fire and there was a lot of smoke,''
Garza said. ``It was an accident.''
   He said the fire was brought under control about 30 minutes later
afetr it broke out and state authorities were investigating the
incident.
   The Nuevo Leon prison houses about 1,800 prisoners.

<HEAD>Scientists Launching Intense Arctic Ozone Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth's protective ozone is thinning more
than expected in Northern regions of the globe, say scientists who
on Tuesday detailed an intense research effort to try to find out
the reasons why.
   While the so-called ozone hole over the South Pole has attracted
the most media attention, a lesser but still significant thinning
also has been found in the North.
   And that has prompted a $10 million, six-week research effort
starting Jan. 1. Based in Stavanger, Norway, the research will
involve scientists from the United States, United Kingdom, Norway,
West Germany and Denmark.
   Satellite data show an ozone decline of between 2.5 percent and
6.5 percent in the northernmost areas. Scientific theory had
expected a drop of only about 1.5 percent, explained Dr. Dan
Albritton of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``That certainly arches the eyebrows,'' he commented.
   While this isn't in the same ballpark with the 30 percent to 50
percent ozone depletion reported in the Antarctic, the big
difference is that people live in the North, Albritton said.
   And for every 1 percent drop in ozone, levels of skin cancer can
rise as much as 2 percent, explained Dr. Robert Watson of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Watson and Albritton provided details of their planned research
project at a news conference.
   ``Understanding what occurs in the Arctic will be much more
difficult than in the Antarctic,'' Watson said. ``We are looking for
subtle changes in a much more variable atmosphere.''
   Chlorine and bromine compounds released into the atmosphere by
human activities have been blamed for the Antarctic ozone loss.
   Trapped by winds circling the South Pole, those chemicals take
advantage of ice clouds in the stratosphere as a location for
chemical reactions with the ozone. When the South Pole weather warms
in the springtime, the hole disappears, along with the ice clouds.
   The Arctic is not as bitterly cold as the South Pole, and the
high ice clouds form less readily, Albritton said, but these clouds
still form and can help promote the reactions that damage ozone.
   The Montreal Protocol in which many nations have agreed to take
actions to eliminate release of chlorofluorocarbons, which have been
blamed for much ozone damage, was based on a 1.5 percent drop in
Arctic ozone, Albritton noted.
   If the scientists confirm the satellite reports of declines two
to three times higher than 1.5 percent, further steps may be needed,
he said.
   The scientists operating from Stavanger will use an ER-2
long-range, high altitude research plane as well as a DC-8 aircraft
instrumented as a flying laboratory.
   No less than six computers will analyze data collected by the
planes, balloons, satellites and ground-based instruments.
   In addition, the Soviet Union will conduct ozone research in its
Northern regions at the same time, and later the two groups will
share data.

   Joel Steinberg's ex-lover testified today at his
murder trial that she lied to police about bruises on their
illegally adopted daughter because she wanted to protect him even
though she believed he had inflicted the bruises.
   Hedda Nussbaum said she told detectives who interviewed her the
morning that 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg was carried unconscious from
their apartment that the child had been hit in the head by a
playmate a few days earlier. She said she also told them that Lisa
``fell a lot while roller-skating.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, admitted under cross-examination by Steinberg's
lawyer, Ira London, that the statements were either wholly or partly
lies.
   ``I was trying to create a cover story at the time for what Joel
had done,'' Ms. Nussbaum testified.
   London reminded Ms. Nussbaum that she had repeatedly said that
she had not seen Steinberg hit Lisa before the girl lost
consciousness.
   ``The bruises on the body, I assumed Joel had done,'' she replied.
   Ms. Nussbaum had told police that a bruise on the girl's forehead
was the result of a slap from a classmate. She testified that while
Lisa had been slapped by a friend, she had not seen any bruise until
later, when Lisa was taken to the hospital the morning of Nov. 2,
1987. She died three days later of head injuries.
   London concluded his five-day cross-examination of Ms. Nussbaum
with two questions that go to the heart of the defense: ``Isn't it
true that you have placed a sanitary cordon around the events to
protect yourself from a painful memory?'' and ``Isn't it a fact that
you hare willfully forgotten things and events to falsify your own
reality?''
   To both questions, Ms. Nussbaum replied, ``No.''
   Steinberg's lawyers appeared to be trying to bolster their claim
that he was not criminally responsible for Lisa's death.
   London has asked court permission to file an insanity defense,
but Judge Harold Rothwax refused. The lawyer has tried to show that
Steinberg actually believed some of the things he told Ms. Nussbaum.
   London said a psychiatrist who examined Steinberg twice has
prepared an affidavit saying the defendant has a ``delusional
disorder _ paranoid type'' and is willing to testify to that in the
state criminal court trial.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with fatally beating
his illegally adopted daughter, Lisa. Prosecutors also allege he
beat Ms. Nussbaum.
   Interest in the case has become so widespread that much of Ms.
Nussbaum's testimony has been carried live on local television. CNN
carried some of today's and Monday's testimony nationally.
   Ms. Nussbaum's lawyers Monday released copies of hundreds of
support letters they say she has received since taking the stand.
   ``I can't tell you how much my heart has ached for you. ... There
are so many women across America who are cheering you on,'' wrote
one woman from Pennsylvania.
   Another writer called her ``an inspiration to all battered women
and children across the nation.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, who lived with Steinberg for 12 years, testified
Monday that Steinberg's behavior became more erratic and bizarre as
his use of cocaine increased in the two months before Lisa's death.
   ``Joel was verbalizing a lot of peculiar ideas, unusual things,
telling me stories that seem pretty improbable today,'' Ms. Nussbaum
said.
   ``Things that made no sense?'' asked London.
   ``Yes,'' replied Ms. Nussbaum.
   She said Steinberg told her ``a number of people were staring at
him and trying to hypnotize him. He also told me he thought people
had been trying to hypnotize him for years, even back when he was in
the Air Force.''
   She said Steinberg told her she was not her parents' natural
child and that ``my father had made a deal with someone in Europe''
to get her as a baby.
   Ms. Nussbaum also said Steinberg called the Manhattan district
attorney's office anonymously in 1984 to complain ``that I was
involved with a cult.''
   She said the cult supposedly hypnotized people and used them
sexually, and Steinberg thought she was in the group's thrall.
   ``Did you believe you were being manipulated by a cult?'' London
asked.
   ``I believed it,'' she said, adding she now believes Steinberg
used these stories to control her.
   Ms. Nussbaum said Steinberg's unusual behavior was exacerbated by
cocaine and that she and Steinberg often used the drug around the
time Lisa died.
   Previously, she testified that she and Steinberg used cocaine the
night of Nov. 1, 1987, rather than help Lisa, who was lying
unconscious on their bathroom floor. Lisa was removed from
Steinberg's apartment early the next day by authorities.
   Steinberg denies that he hit the girl.
   The couple raised Lisa from birth after acquiring her from an
unwed Long Island teen-ager. They never formally adopted her.

   The fifth of seven bodies found buried
in the yard of a boardinghouse has been identified as that of a
63-year-old transient, authorities said.
   The identification of James Albert Gallop was made with the help
of X-rays, which detected metal sutures in his head from brain
surgery, coroners officials announced Monday.
   Police Capt. Michael O'Kane described Gallop as a transient.
   Coroners investigators said they expected to have the two
remaining bodies identified by the end of the week.
   The seven bodies were unearthed last month in the yard of
Dorothea Montalvo Puente's Victorian rooming house here. Police
believe the victims were tenants killed for their Social Security
checks.
   Puente, 59, has been charged with one count of murder in the
case, and additional counts are expected to be filed in January,
officials said. Puente is being held without bail and faces a Jan.
18 preliminary hearing.
   The victims were believed killed this year, officials said.
   In addition, police believe a man whose body was discovered in a
wooden box along the Sacramento River in Sutter County on New Year's
Day 1986 had been one of Puente's tenants.
   On Saturday, police arrested Ismael Carrasco Florez, 46, a
Sacramento handyman they believe built the box for Puente.
   Florez was released on $3,000 bail after being booked on
suspicion of being an accessory to murder.

   Four high school students linked by

   Officers recovered the stolen cars, stripped of all usable parts,

   A woman was taken to jail in handcuffs
after clashing with a federal judge over whether she could be forced
to be a juror.
   Judy Ann Jones, 39, of Brandon was taken into custody Monday at
her pharmacy after she failed to answer a summons. U.S. District
Judge Tom S. Lee ordered her jailed a short time later for contempt
of court on grounds she had removed her name from voting rolls in
order to avoid jury duty.
   Jones was led in handcuffs to Jackson City Jail and released
after paying a $200 fine. She refused Tuesday to talk about the
incident.
   Lee's office called Jones on Monday when she did not respond to
the jury summons, records show, and the woman informed court
officials that she was not qualified because she had taken her name
off voting rolls earlier that morning.
   Jones said she then asked to speak with the judge.
   When that request was refused because Lee was in court, Jones was
quoted as replying, ``Yes, it's funny just how important some people
think they are. I had no intentions of sitting on a jury. I am no
longer a registered voter in Mississippi and I don't ever intend to
be.''
   When Lee heard of the conversation, he ordered her arrest.
   In court, she told him it was essential for her to be at her
pharmacy.
   The judge told Jones it was not her decision whether to respond
to a jury summons. ``Do you understand that?'' he asked.
   ``I understand there's a federal mandate I have to serve if I'm a
registered voter and you send out a letter so specifying,'' she
said. ``However, I'm no longer a registered voter and I do not
qualify.''
   ``Let me put your mind at ease about that,'' the judge shot back.
``That's not an excuse, after you've had a summons, to between
Friday and this morning, remove your name from the voting roll.''

<HEAD>Bush Transition Officials Have Marshall Islands Connection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's no surprise to see Texas connections as
George Bush, an adopted son of the Lone Star State, puts together
his administration. But a Marshall Islands connection?
   Over at Bush transition headquarters, the Texans have competition
from a network with connections to the sun-drenched, dirt-poor
Marshall Islands, two atoll chains in the Pacific with a total land
mass of 70 square miles and a population of 35,000, the place where
the United States tested nuclear weapons for years.
   In a town where who you know is often as important as what you
know, the Marshalls seem to have friends in high places.
   Wilfred I. Kendall, the little republic's diplomatic
representative, says, ``It's good to know someone higher up. It's
important.'
   The Marshalls network give an example of how connections and
contacts are often the grease that make the city run. Ties are
formed when people in federal agencies, Congress and private busines
are thrown together to work on a single issues.
   Several officials at the Bush transition office are very familiar
with the islands' recent history: They worked on negotiations that
led to independence for the U.S. trust territory in October 1986.
   A key contact for Kendall is Fred M. Zeder, who was chief U.S.
negotiator of the compact with the Marshalls. Zeder and his wife,
Martha, are among the president-elect's best friends. In April,
Zeder accompanied Bush, his friend Nicholas Brady, the secretary of
the treasury; and Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. on a weekend holiday in
Florida.
   Like Bush, Zeder is a wealthy businessman who moved from
Connecticut to Texas. He has also lived in Hawaii and the nation's
capital. In recent years, the Zeders have given substantial sums to
support Bush politically. In 1987, federal records show, they each
gave the maximum permitted, $5,000 to Bush's political action
committee. Additionally, Zeder gave $11,000 this year to the
Republican National Committee.
   Zeder and James Baker III, the Texan designated to be the
secretary of state, are the highest-paid people at transition, with
salaries at an annual rate of about $71,000.
   Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman for the transition, said Zeder is
``mostly working on appointments and personnel,'' especially those
for the Interior Department, where he once worked.
   Zeder's son, Howard, is the Marshalls' maritime commissioner and
part-owner of a company that operates the republic's new
ship-flagging registry. The registry was partly financed with U.S.
development aid.
   Such an operation _ under which ships fly the flag of the
countries in which they are registered even though the vessels may
be owned by citizens of other countries _ can be remunerative. For
example, Liberia's registry, the world's largest, brings in between
$30 million and $40 million a year.
   Another friend of the Marshalls is Peter S. Watson, a New
Zealand-born attorney who represents the republic in his private law
practice. Watson, who became an American citizen less than a year
ago, is lending a hand on ethics and legal issues at the transition.
   Howard Hills, a lawyer at the State Department handling Marshalls
business, is dealing with logistics while on leave at the
transition. Hills, who worked with Zeder when the Reagan
administration was pushing the compact with the Marshalls, recently
spoke at a reception in New York tossed by the ship registry.
   Manase Mansur, a staffer at the House Interior and Insular
Affairs Committee, the panel that supervised legislation on the
Marshalls atoll chain, also has a position in the transition's
administrative office.
   Glen said the men perform different functions at the office, but
don't work on issues affecting the Marshalls. All except Mansur are
listed as paid employees of the transition.
   Zeder was the subject of criticism after the compact with the
Marshalls was ratified.
   What has irked some is an arrangement in which Zeder's son became
the Marshalls' maritime commissioner as well as having a financial
stake in the ship registry. In October, Majestic Shipping Corp.
became the first company to fly the Marshalls' flags.
   The arrangement would have been barred if former Rep. John
Seiberling, D-Ohio, an ex-member of the interior committee, had had
his way.
   Seiberling sought unsuccessfully to insert language in the
compact that would have ensured ``nobody who worked on negotiations
could receive or be part of any contract under which they would
receive funds from the freely associated states.'' The ban also
would have applied to family members of people involved.
   ``We wanted to make clear that nobody was going to profit from
any deals that were made,'' he said in a telephone interview.
Seiberling retired from the House in 1986.
   Neither Howard Zeder nor Watson, who has served as a spokesman
for the Marshalls and for the registry, will reveal the financial
details of the private company that operates the ship registry.
Watson is associated with the law firm of Coudert Bros.
   Howard Zeder sees the registry as a key element of a plan to
develop the impoverished Marshalls. ``This is one of the few
ventures that has real development potential for the islands,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Mandela in `Total Isolation' at Prison Farm, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela is in ``total
isolation'' at his new prison farm house, his attorney said Tuesday
after the African National Congress leader met with his wife, Winnie.
   Mrs. Mandela, her daughter, Zinzi, and three grandchildren made
their first visit to the Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town,
where Mandela was moved to a prison staff house last week.
   The family is allowed unlimited access to Mandela, but Mrs.
Mandela visited for only 80 minutes, saying they won't accept
special privileges from the government until all political prisoners
receive the same treatment.
   Attorney Ismail Ayob, speaking on behalf of Mrs. Mandela, told a
news conference afterward: ``This is not freedom. The move is in
fact a retrogressive step. Mr. Mandela now has no contact at all
with any of his (jailed ANC) colleagues.''
   Mrs. Mandela attended the news conference with Ayob, but did not
speak.
   The Mandela family ``felt saddened and particularly hurt today
when they saw what has happened to Mr. Mandela,'' Ayob said. ``He is
in a house ... surrounded by a great many prison officials. It is a
cruel situation that he is in total isolation.''
   Ayob accompanied Mrs. Mandela to the prison gate, but wasn't
allowed to see Mandela because authorities had not responded to his
request for a visit.
   Mandela's house, complete with a swimming pool, in on a remote
part of the prison complex, closer to a private game reserve full of
zebra and giraffe than the main prison building.
   Some whites have written letters to South African newspapers
expressing outrage that a prisoner is being kept in such
``luxurious'' conditions.
   However, Ayob noted that Mandela had no say over his move. ``I
don't even think he can swim,'' said Ayob.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mandela, 70, contracted tuberculosis in August, but has recovered
following three months in a hospital. The government's decision not
to send him back to prison appears part of phased release designed
to calm the public clamor over his possible freedom.
   By placing Mandela in a special house, however, the government
has underscored Mandela's special stature.
   The government has expressed concern that if Mandela was released
unexpectedly, the move could re-ignite widespread black protest that
has largely been silenced under a 30-month state of emergency. The
government also is worried that freeing Mandela could unleash a
violent backlash by right-wing whites.
   In a related development Tuesday, recently released activist
Zwelakhe Sisulu visited Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town to see his
father, Walter Sisulu, a leading ANC figure and close colleague of
Mandela.
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, editor of the New Nation newspaper, was released
from detention Dec. 2 after being held for two years without charge.
Walter Sisulu was convicted with Mandela at the same trial in 1964
and is serving a life sentence.
   Zwelakhe Sisulu is under severe restrictions that bar him from
working as a journalist, participating in politics, or talking to
the media.

<HEAD>CBS Schedule Shakeup Cancels GTG Shows, Mary Tyler Moore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler
Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS' schedule,
the network announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two
of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment.
   The network, which has ranked last in the ratings so far this
season, said ``Annie McGuire,'' starring Miss Moore, would have its
last broadcast in its Wednesday time period on Dec. 28, suggesting
it might be brought back in the future. But the network said ``The
Van Dyke Show'' and ``Raising Miranda,'' the GTG shows, would have
their final broadcasts this month.
   ``Dirty Dancing,'' a half-hour show based on the hit movie of the
same name will go ``on hiatus'' in January. ``Simon & Simon,'' the
long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last
broadcast in its Saturday time period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door
open to reviving it yet again.
   GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM
Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker
founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore.
   The third GTG show for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,'' an
hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its
low-rated Tuesday time slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and
Van Dyke shows.
   GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV
enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine show ``USA Today: The
Television Show,'' though the company insists it is sticking by that
show for the long haul.
   In the most recent ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie
McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' were the lowest-rated network
shows of the week.
   ``Raising Miranda'' was the third lowest-rated show last week.
   Both ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' had problems
from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore show was
partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative
reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom
performers ever.
   Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in
the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' in the 1970s.
   CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,'' a Vietnam series, will
return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,''
starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will
join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing'' and
``Raising Miranda'' on Saturday night.
   The Smothers Brothers will also return to the schedule for four
shows in January and February.

   Paramedics called to treat an asthmatic 9-year-old
boy left a city housing project when their ambulance was pelted by
eggs and returned with police too late to save the boy, authorities
said today.
   Paramedics were unable to revive Carl Jarnagin, who died a short
time later at a hospital, said Bill Crowley, a Chicago Fire
Department spokesman.
   The two paramedics, first summoned by an emergency call at 4:16
p.m. Monday, were not aware of the seriousness of the boy's health
problem when they arrived at the Chicago Housing Authority building
on the city's South Side, Crowley said.
   Crowley was uncertain when the ambulance first arrived at the
Dearborn Homes project, but said it left at 4:28 p.m.
   ``There were different objects hitting the vehicle, and there was
egg on the windshield. Projectiles, maybe stones, were hitting the
vehicle,'' Crowley said. ``For that reason, it was decided to
leave.''
   He said he did not know where the objects were coming from, or
who was throwing them.
   Some building residents disputed the story, saying the paramedics
initially refused to enter the building though nothing was being
thrown at them.
   Sandra Falls, 26, a secretary for the CHA's Local Advisory
Council at the Dearborn Homes, said residents told her nothing was
thrown at the vehicle, but instead ambulance workers refused to
enter the building for 15 to 20 minutes, even with police there.
   ``There was no one throwing rocks out the window,'' added Randy
Taylor, a building resident. ``There was just, I think, fear of the
black community.''
   Crowley did not immediately know the races of the paramedics.
Building residents are overwhelmingly black.
   Police received a call for help from the Fire Department at 4:21
p.m., said Officer Charles Marschke. Police entered the fifth-floor
apartment, found the boy ``unresponsive'' on the floor in a bedroom,
tried to revive him and put out a call for the paramedics to return.
The police report did not mention whether the ambulance had been
attacked, he said.
   According to Crowley, police arrived at the apartment project at
4:34 p.m., and the ambulance returned at 4:40 p.m. Paramedics worked
to revive the boy for 30 minutes before taking him to Mercy
Hospital, where he died, Crowley said.
   The Fire Department will investigate the incident, he said.
``We'll pull our radio tapes and speak to people and try to get a
blow-by-blow of what happened.''
   Paramedics often are accompanied to CHA buildings by police or a
fire unit, making the trip into some high-crime areas safer, Crowley
said.
   ``Going into the projects alone is a problem,'' he said. With
only two unassisted paramedics at a scene where they are likely to
encounter hostility, he added, ``the possibility certainly exists of
them getting injured.''
   ``It was so frustrating for them that this child passed away,''
Crowley said. ``So many times you go to the scene and it's something
very minor.''

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat today offered a
three-point peace plan calling for negotiations with Israel at an
international peace conference and U.N. supervision of
Israeli-occupied territories.
   In a long-awaited speech to a special session of the U.N. General
Assembly, Arafat referred specifically to Israel several times and
directly appealed to Israeli leaders to join peace talks.
   ``I ask the leaders of Israel to come here, under the sponsorship
of the United Nations, so that, together, we can forge that peace,''
Arafat said.
   He also appealed to the Israeli people. ``Come,'' he said, ``let
us make the peace of the bold, far from the arrogance of power and
the weapons of destruction, far from the occupation and oppression
and humiliation and murder and torture.''
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dismissed Arafat's
initiatives, saying the PLO had not changed its policy of terror. He
called on Washington not to recognize the PLO.
   ``We know what hides behind his (Arafat's) words,'' Shamir told a
news conference. ``We know that as they are spoken acts of terror
continue.'' He cited an incident today in which a Palestinian shot
and killed two Israelis in the occupied West Bank.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Arafat failed to meet conditions for opening a dialogue with the
United States because his speech did not clearly recognize Israel's
right to exist.
   The speech contained some ``interesting and positive
developments,'' Redman said, but ``continued to be ambiguous on key
issues'' _ including recognition of Israel, renunciation of
terrorism and acceptance of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338.
   Arafat's three-point plan called first for ``a serious effort''
to convene an international peace conference in Geneva under U.N.
auspices.
   His second point urged that ``occupied Palestinian land'' be
placed under temporary U.N. supervision, that peacekeeping forces be
deployed and that Israeli troops withdraw. He did not say if he was
referring to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel in
1967.
   Arafat's third point called for ``a comprehensive settlement''
among all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including ``the
state of Palestine, Israel and other neighbors, within the framework
of the international conference.''
   He said the conference should be conducted ``on the basis of
Resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and the
balance of interests, especially our people's rights in freedom,
national independence, and respect for the right to exist in peace
and security for all.'' The U.N. resolutions provide for all
countries in the region to exist within secure borders.
   Immediately afterward, Moshe Raviv of Israel's Foreign Ministry
criticized Arafat's speech as ``evasive rhetoric'' and repeated
Israel's claim that an independent Palestinian state is an obstacle
to peace.
   Yohanan Bein, Israel's U.N. ambassador, said he saw nothing new
in Arafat's remarks.
   ``There was more ambiguity in this speech than in Algiers,'' he
said, referring to Arafat's address last month to the Palestine
National Council. ``I do not see any major departure ... ambiguity
and more ambiguity.''
   Arafat's speech expanded on Palestinian proposals for Middle East
peace and appeared to be a bid to gain U.S. support.
   He said the Palestine National Council at its Algiers meeting in
November had rejected terrorism in all its forms, ``including state
terrorism.''
   Israel said after that meeting that the council had not
recognized Israel explicitly and the declarations did not warrant
opening a dialogue with the PLO, which it views as a terrorist group.
   Arafat, wearing his traditional khaki military uniform and
black-and-white checkered Arab headdress, spoke in Arabic for an
hour and 20 minutes. Delegates in the hall applauded for nearly a
minute afterwards.
   An English text of the speech was distributed by PLO officials
after Arafat spoke.
   Earlier in his speech, Arafat thanked countries that supported
his right to address the world body in Geneva after the United
States denied him a visa, preventing him from speaking at U.N.
headquarters in New York.
   He also thanked the countries of Western Europe and Japan for
their recent stand following the Palestine Liberation Organization's
declaration of independence in Algiers.
   In Israel, radio reports had said that after Arafat's speech, the
United States would announce it accepted the PLO as a partner in
Middle East peace talks.
   The reports on Israeli radio and army radio said the PLO chief's
speech was submitted to American officials and Arafat agreed to
change the language to meet U.S. conditions of recognizing Israeli
and renouncing terrorism.
   Israel criticized the U.N. decision to invite Arafat to speak and
cited 10 terrorist attacks in which he allegedly had ``direct
involvement.''
   Arafat last addressed the General Assembly in 1974 in New York.
   Delegates of at least 92 countries, including the United States,
were due to address the session in Geneva. The delegates included 18
foreign ministers or deputy foreign ministers, mostly from Third
World and Communist countries.
   About 70 countries, mostly Third World and communist, have
recognized the Palestinian state.
   Arafat's cause appears to have been strengthened by persistent
Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 300
Palestinians and a dozen Israelis have been killed in the revolt.
   The Palestine National Council meeting in Algiers implicitly
recognized Israel, and Arafat said in Stockholm last week the PLO
would accept an Arab state and ``a Jewish state, Israel,'' side by
side.
   While some European countries praised the PLO for moderating its
stand, Israeli and U.S. officials said the latest statements did not
meet preconditions for talks with the PLO _ clear recognition of
Israel's right to exist and renunciation of terrorism.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting between rival Shiite Moslem
militias resumed Tuesday in the slums of south Beirut after a
two-week lull, police said.
   A police spokesman said there was no way to confirm whether the
captors of a U.S. Marine colonel had fulfilled their threat to kill
him, and that police had no suspects in the shooting death of a
65-year-old Belgian.
   The Japanese widow of Arthur van Nieuwerburgh, 65, a teacher who
carried Belgian and British passports, returned to Beirut on
Tuesday, the day after her husband was killed near their Beirut
restaurant.
   ``My husband is dead. I don't know what to do,'' Suyun Tsuchida
told reporters after arriving from Ankara, Turkey, where she has
considered opening a Japanese restaurant. She said she did not know
why he was slain.
   Police said one combatant was killed and three civilians were
wounded in fighting between the mainstream Shiite militia Amal,
which is pro-Syrian, and the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah
(Party of God).
   The militias, which are vying for dominance among Lebanon's 1
million Shiites, battled with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades in the Chiyah and Hay Madi slums of south Beirut, police
reported. They said the shooting started soon after daybreak and
lasted about two hours.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sector
moved in to stop the fighting, the first between the factions since
Nov. 22.
   Many of the 15 Western hostages missing in Lebanon are believed
held in Hay Madi, the main south Beirut stronghold of Hezbollah,
which is thought to be an umbrella organization for Shiite
kidnappers.
   Nine of the captives are Americans. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The police spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing
regulations, said there was ``no way ... to ascertain whether the
hostages have been affected by the fighting'' or the threat against
Higgins was carried out.
   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, commander of a U.N. observer group,
was abducted by a group calling itself the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth. The U.S. Marine officer, 43, was seized Feb. 17
near the southern port of Tyre.
   A statement signed with the organizaion's name, released Monday,
said: ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy. The spy has been turned over to those responsible for
executing this just and revolutionary verdict.''
   No date for carrying out the ``sentence'' was given in the
15-line statement, written in Arabic and delivered to the
independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.

<HEAD>Pentagon Expanding Probe That Finds Questionable Consulting Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon auditors will expand a review of top
military contractors that already has found U.S. taxpayers are being
billed for millions of dollars in questionable consulting fees,
officials said Tuesday.
   The first investigation covered a dozen contractors, but the new
review will look at 18 more over the next 10 weeks, said William
Reed, director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
   The review was ordered by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in
the wake of the Justice Department's ongoing investigation of
possible fraud and bribery involving defense contractors.
   That investigation, code-named ``Ill Wind,'' has not yet produced
any indictments. It centers on the use of consultants employed by
defense firms to win Pentagon contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Reed said the review of the dozen firms found that contractors
``were spending considerable sums supplementing virtually every
in-house activity with professional and consultant services.''
   The Pentagon was billed by the dozen firms for $237 million worth
of consultanting fees over the past year, Reed said. Of that total,
investigators found that $57.6 million was questionable and the
contractors are being asked to provide more support for the claims.
   ``Most of these questionable expenditures represent claimed costs
where the contractor could not produce evidence of services
rendered, or, to a lesser degree could not produce written
agreements as to the value of, and type, service being purchased,''
Reed said.
   Normally, contractors pay consultants from their own funds and
then bill the Pentagon for reimbursement.
   Reed did not name the dozen companies and said he was withholding
the information because the cases were still under discussion about
allowable costs.
   Reed made his statements before the Senate Government Affairs
federal service subcommittee, which is chaired by Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark.
   Pryor said consultants do legitimate jobs, but he added that
``the Ill Wind probe suggests that consultants may also be involved
in criminal activities, involving bribery, fraud, collusive bidding
and trafficking in confidential material.''
   One of the biggest problems, Pryor admitted, is coming up with a
definition of a consultant.
   Reed agreed. ``At the onset of our review, we encountered
significant difficulty in isolating `consultant' services and costs
due to the lack of a universally accepted definition of the term.''
   Pryor criticized the administration's policy of having
contractors police themselves. Administration officials have
testified to Congress that defense firms are being asked to do a
better, more thorough job of making sure all their expenses are
justified.
   The Pentagon audit ``suggests that the much ballyhooed theory of
this administration that defense contractors will police themselves
without strict controls is a pipe dream,'' Pryor said.
   Reed said his agency was urging some changes in federal
regulations governing allowable costs.
   In the wake of the public announcement about the Ill Wind
investigation, Carlucci wrote to the top 200 defense contractors,
urging them to tighten their controls on consultants.
   Since the Pentagon's audit of the dozen companies, Carlucci has
written again to the companies to urge them to act, said Eleanor
Spector, deputy assistant secretary of defense for procurement.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saying the PLO
had not changed its terrorist ways, today rejected Yasser Arafat's
peace initiatives and called on the United States to withhold
recognition of the PLO.
   ``We know what hides behind his (Arafat's) words,'' Shamir told a
news conference after Arafat addressed the U.N. General Assemby in
Geneva. ``We know that as they are spoken acts of terror continue.''
   Shortly before he spoke, Israeli officials announced that a
Palestinian in the West Bank had shot to death two Israelis after
seizing a gun from a Jewish settler. The Palestinian also was killed.
   Referring to the incident, Shamir said ``what happened is another
illustration of a decision by the hostile circles in the PLO to
continue their violence.''
   Calling on Washington to withhold recognition of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Shamir said that in his speech Arafat spoke
favorably of a ``war of liberation'' and stopped short of
recognizing Israel.
   ``I hope that as long as these conditions are not met the United
States will not recognize the PLO,'' Shamir said.
   He said he was ready for peace talks with Arab states and
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but not the
PLO.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's political rival in the
coalition government, had no immediate comment on Arafat's speech.
   However, the liberal Citizens Rights movement, which was aligned
with the Labor Party in the recent parliament elections, called on
both the U.S. and Israeli governments to start talks with the PLO.
   ``The Israeli government must now put the PLO to the test and
propose peace negotaitions,'' it said. ``As long as the government
refuses to recognize the significant changes in the PLO position,
then the American administration should recognize the changes, meet
Arafat and advance the cause of peace in our region.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Arafat did not meet conditions for opening a dialogue with the
United States because he did not clearly state PLO recognition of
Israel.
   Israeli radios had reported earlier today that the U.S.
government was expected to announce after Arafat's speech that it
accepted the PLO as a partner in Middle East peace talks.
   However, the radio reports said the U.S. decision was contingent
on Arafat meeting U.S. conditions in his U.N. speech in Geneva.
   To U.S. officials, the three key conditions for opening a
dialogue with the PLO are acceptance of 1967 and 1973 U.N. Security
Council resolutions asserting the right of all Middle Eastern states
to live within secure borders, explicit PLO recognition of Israel
and renunciation of terrorism.
   U.S. officials reportedly proposed some alterations in language
after requesting and receiving the speech in advance. Israel radio
said the United States was told the changes had been accepted.
   Today, several dozen Palestinians, drinking steaming cups of
sweet tea and coffee, listened to Arafat's speech broadcast on the
French-run Monte Carlo radio at the Hakawati theater in east
Jerusalem.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said Arafat had challenged
Israel to join a peace process. ``There are now no more excuses for
Israel not to give a positive response to this message of peace,''
   He said explicit recognition was not possible because it meant
recognizing Israel with specific borders, which should be determined
in negotiations.
   ``Spelling out such specific boundaries could be detrimental to
negotiations. Arafat is leaving the boundaries open to
negotiations,'' said Kuttab.

presented a six-ton bronze ``thank you'' to the city _ a sculpture
commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan
rehabilitation of Europe.
   During dedication ceremonies Monday, De Mita said the work by
modern Italian master Arnaldo Pomodoro was ``a token of my country's

<HEAD>Thatcher Angered as Ireland Refuses Priest's Extradition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Ireland clashed bitterly over the Irish
attorney general's refusal Tuesday to extradite an Irish Catholic
priest wanted on terrorism charges.
   Raising an 18-day-old confrontation over the Rev. Patrick Ryan to
a new pitch, the Irish said the priest would not get a fair trial in
Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called that ``a great
insult to all of the people of this country.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, in an angry response in the House of Commons, said
``we repudiate utterly'' the Irish attorney general's assertion that
Ryan would not be fairly tried before a British jury.
   Attorney General John Murray said British politicians and
newspapers had prejudiced his trial by attacking him ``in
intemperate language and frequently in the form of extravagantly
worded headlines.''
   ``They raised the case to a unique status and can only have
intensified the impact and lasting effect on members of the public
of what was being published,'' he said.
   He added that statements in the British Parliament ``must,
because of their origin, carry particular weight with potential
jurors.''
   Ryan, in a statement read to reporters by family and supporters
in Dundrum, County Tipperary, called Murray's decision ``a victory
for all.''
   Answering parliamentary questions, Mrs. Thatcher said Murray's
decision meant that ``someone accused of very serious crimes will be
at liberty in the Irish Republic.''
   ``We repudiate utterly the assertion that Patrick Ryan would not
receive a fair trial in this country. Of course he would,'' she
said, adding:
   ``To arrest anyone on charges of that nature is inevitably going
to be receiving front-page treatment and it will be a matter for the
courts if there were any prejudice to the trial.''
   But the headlines would have died down long before the case came
to trial, she said.
   The Ryan affair has plunged Britain into confrontation with two
countries: Belgium for failing to extradite him when he was arrested
there, and Ireland for letting him go free after the Belgians flew
him home.
   Ryan, 58, says he is innocent. Britain suspects him of serving
the Irish Republican Army in its war to rid Northern Ireland of
British rule, and wants him on four warrants alleging conpiracy to
murder and cause explosions, and possessing explosives.
   Murray said Ryan might face trial in Ireland on terrorism
charges, and added he had asked the British for the file of evidence
on him. But Mrs. Thatcher said an Irish court would hear only two of
the charges, and ``there will be problems about security of
witnesses.''
   Ryan's statement said that if Ireland tried him, ``they will be
acting on behalf of the British government. I will resist... in the
same way I resisted my extradition.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said the 1987 Anglo-Irish extradition treaty was
``not working satisfactorily'' because Dublin had ``unilaterally''
changed it to make extraditions contingent not upon the courts but
upon the attorney general's approval.
   When Ryan was arrested in his Brussels apartment in June, police
said he had a forged passport and manuals on making bombs. He also
was linked to the purchase in 1975 of a timer that later was used in
a bomb.
   Ryan fasted for three weeks in his cell to protest extradition.
And although the Belgian court ruled against him, the Brussels
government decided the extradition papers were flawed, and flew him
to Ireland on Nov. 25.
   Ryan checked into a clinic outside Dublin, disappeared three days
later, and remains in an undisclosed place of refuge with a
religious order.
   He was suspended by his order in 1974 after he refused a transfer
to a parish church in England and said he would rather work on
behalf of families of Irish nationalists dead or jailed in Northern
Ireland.
   Ryan's cousin, Tom Ryan, insisted to the British Broadcasting
Corp. that the priest's only crime was to feed and clothe families
in Northern Ireland who had lost ``their main breadwinner.''
   Ryan's work might relieve pressure on the IRA's funds, he said,
but ``that kind of guilt is on a whole lot of us here, thousands of
us,'' he said.

   Rescue workers said today they believe all bodies
have been recovered from the wreckage of a three-train crash in
south London that killed 33 people and injured more than 100.
   Railway officials said Monday's accident near Clapham Junction,
one of Europe's busiest rail stations, may have been the result of a
signal mix-up caused by work being done on the line.
   Opposition politicians and consumer groups said lax safety
measures and overcrowded trains were underlying causes of the
morning rush-hour crash.
   A crowded commuter train plowed into the rear of a stationary
passenger train. An empty freight train coming in the opposite
direction on a parallel track then hit wreckage from the first crash.
   More than 110 of the estimated 1,500 passengers on the trains
were hospitalized, 32 suffering serious injuries including multiple
fractures, crushed abdomens and amputations, hospital and ambulance
officials said.
   ``Bodies were cut in half, limbs were thrown around by the
impact,'' physician Robin Winch said.
   The condition of the bodies caused officials to repeatedly change
the official death toll from the crash. On Monday night, officials
said 36 people died. But tonight, Scotland Yard revised the death
toll to 33, saying the discrepancy was caused by the mutilated state
of some of the bodies.
   Rescuers aided by arc lights and cranes worked until dawn today
to clear debris from the crash, Britain's worst rail disaster since
43 people died when a subway train crashed in a London tunnel in
1975.
   A British Rail spokesman who requested anonymity said officials
hoped to have commuter trains running again by tonight's rush hour,
and at least some trains running through the accident area.
   The Duchess of York and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
separately visited the injured at St. George's Hospital.
   Allison Killerby, a 26-year-old clerk who suffered deep gashes
across her nose and forehead, recalled:
   ``I saw people's legs and arms and heard them screaming for help
... In one way I wish I had been unconscious so I wouldn't remember
it all so clearly.''
   Eight of the 20 cars overturned and three were hurled into the
air. Some passengers were trapped up to four hours.
   Ronald Arlette, 52, who was on the stationary train, said:
``There was an almighty bang, like an explosion. The carriage went
up and we flew over and over.
   ``Strangely enough, nobody panicked,'' he said. ``I know it
sounds strange, but we just lay there and we had a laugh and a bit
of a joke with each other. It just seemed the best thing to do to
keep our spirits up.''
   The British Railways Board said preliminary investigations
suggested the crash may have been due to a signal failure associated
with modernization of the line's 40-year-old signaling equipment.
   The Railways Board said it ordered an internal inquiry into the
accident, and Transport Secretary Paul Channon announced an
independent public inquiry.
   ``I don't think the actions of the drivers will be significant in
our inquiry,'' Gordon Pettitt, general manager of British Rail's
southern region, said. ``The fault that we had today was associated
with resignaling work in hand rather than a basic fault in the
signaling system itself.''
   He would not confirm one television report that a signaling
expert had found a loose wire that could have caused random signals
_ green, red or yellow _ to be displayed to approaching trains.
   The resignaling at Clapham Junction is part of a $37 million
project begun a year ago to modernize the equipment on the line.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo said the project was evidence
that neglect did not play a part in the crash.
   ``The investment that is going on into British Rail at the moment
is really at a record level. There's been a huge amount over recent
years. There's an enormous amount planned for years to come,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   ``I see no evidence at all to suggest that any economy measures
have contributed to this accident.''
   Others disagreed.
   ``The system has been creaking at the seams for so long that
something had to give,'' said John Stewart, policy coordinator for
Capital, a public transport pressure group.
   John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party's transport spokesman,
cited a Department of Transport report which he said concluded
deaths and serious injuries on trains had risen 62 percent and
collisions 18 percent since 1982.
   The Railways Board said the state-run British Rail network
accepted full responsibility for the disaster. It said claims for
compensation from relatives of the dead and from those injured would
be dealt with quickly. No amounts were stated.

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's U.N. speech on the
outlook for peace in the Middle East contained some ``interesting
and positive'' elements but failed to meet U.S. conditions for a
dialogue with the Palestinian organization, the State Department
said today.
   ``These issues must be handled squarely and without ambiguity,''
spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. official disclosed that the State Department,
working through unspecified ``third parties,'' attempted to persuade
Arafat before the speech to meet the U.S. conditions for a dialogue.
   Israeli sources disclosed that Secretary of State George P.
Shultz had notified Ambassador Moshe Arad Monday night that if the
conditions were met the United States was prepared to deal with the
PLO.
   Shultz and Charles Hill, a close aide who had served in the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv, both called Arad to inform him of the
diplomatic exchanges, said the sources, who insisted on anonymity.
   U.S. policy prohibits diplomatic contacts with the PLO until it
accepts Israel's right to exist. Redman said the United States was
simply responding to requests from ``third parties`` _ he did not
identify them _ on the ``specifics'' of the American conditions for
a dialogue.
   These are: Explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist,
acceptance of 1967 and 1973 U.N. Security Council resolutions
upholding the right of all states to live within secure borders and
renunciation of terrorism.
   Asked whether his administration would meet with the PLO as a
result of Arafat's U.N. speech, President-elect Bush said, ``No.
we've got to get a much clearer statement of everything.''
   Bush said the three U.S. conditions would have to be met. ``I
would welcome any progress, but it's got to be clear on these three
specific points,'' he told reporters during a picture-taking session
as he met with Carlos Andres Perez, the president-elect of Venezuela.
   Redman said the speech contained ``interesting and positive''
aspects, but there were ``problems with all three'' U.S.
requirements for a substantive dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The spokesman specified as positive the ``overall tone'' of the
speech and ``some movement'' by Arafat on the two resolutions.
Redman did not elaborate.
   ``We listened carefully,'' to the speech, Redman said. ``There
were some interesting and positive developments. But it continued to
be ambiguous.''

<TEXT>
   A former Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
radiation safety officer was placed on probation by a federal judge
Tuesday on a charge that stemmed from a 1986 spill of radioactive
material at the base.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Rice ordered James W. Lewis, 62, of
Enon, to serve two years' probation on a charge of illegally
possessing highly radioactive americium.
   Rice also ordered Lewis to pay $50 to a victims' compensation
fund and to perform 200 hours of community service.
   Rice said he believed Lewis was guilty mainly of a lapse in
judgment.
   ``He is not a criminal,'' said Rice. ``He is a good, decent man.''
   Lewis pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly possessing a
quantity of unsealed radioactive americium that was not authorized
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Prosecutors dropped a charge
of making a false statement to the NRC.
   Lewis could have been sentenced to two years in prison, fined as
much as $250,000, and ordered to pay full restitution.
   According to a statement submitted to the court, Lewis on June
15, 1978, received a drum from Newark jeweler J.C. Haynes that
contained lab waste contaminated with what Lewis thought were trace
amounts of americium. Lewis agreed to accept and transport the drum
to Wright-Patterson, where it was stored with other radioactive
materials at the base.
   No one was injured in the spill of the radioactive powder, but a
radiological safety officer said tests showed that one Air Force
officer inhaled a small quantity of the material. The spill resulted
in a $1 million cleanup.
   The powder initially leaked from an unlabeled barrel at the base
while four workers were taking inventory Sept 18, 1986. The powder
is not considered dangerous to the skin, but can cause cancer if it
is swallowed or inhaled, experts say.
   The workers later washed themselves under a spigot at a Boy Scout
camp at the base. Air Force officials said there was no
contamination there but, as a precaution offered to test hundreds of
Boy Scouts who had camped there.
   A second spill of americium occurred Oct. 6, 1986.
   Revelations of the spill one year after it happened touched off
allegations of a coverup by Air Force officials and prompted a U.S.
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing near the base.

<TEXT>
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the senior
statesman credited with guiding Pakistan back to democracy, became
Pakistan's eighth president Tuesday following a landslide victory
reflecting his broad-based support.
   Chief Justice Abdul Haleem administered the oath of office during
a 15-minute ceremony in the mirrored Hall of the Presidency, a
modern building that sits between the two houses of parliament.
   He was to address a joint session of the legislature Wednesday.
   On Monday, the 73-year-old former Senate chairman captured 78
percent of 446 electoral votes cast by members of the Senate,
National Assembly and the four provincial assemblies. They acted as
an electoral college.
   Ishaq Khan was the only one of four candidates who had the
support of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party and its conservative opposition led by Ishaq Khan's
own Muslim League party.
   Pakistanis of almost all political stripes have credited the
senior statesman with even-handedly guiding the country back to
democracy from 11 years of autocracy and martial law under late
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 military plane crash, Investigators
concluded the plane was sabotaged but did not say by whom.
   Ishaq Khan automatically became head of state, but Monday's vote
confirmed him for a full, five-year term.
   On Monday, Ms. Bhutto's government also sailed through its first
confidence motion in parliament, with 73 percent among members
attending.
   She and Ishaq Khan have expressed mutual admiration but Ms.
Bhutto has called for the repeal of a 1985 constitutional amendment
authored by Zia that gives the president broad discretionary powers.
   Such a repeal would restore the prime ministerial system in
effect during the 1970s when her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was
head of government.
   Zia overthrew Bhutto in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged
two years laters on conviction of plotting to murder a political
opponent.
   Ishaq Khan has not commented publicly on the repeal issue and Ms.
Bhutto, 35, has yet to test support for it in parliament.
   Pakistan's election process began with mid-November national and
local polls.
   It will be completed with by-elections sometime in January to
fill disputed seats, or those from districts where a candidate died
during the campaign.

   A pit bull that fatally mauled a 6-month-old
girl had been owned by the girl's father since it was a puppy and
was resentful of the attention the baby was getting, according to a
neighbor's son.
   ``I think the dog was just jealous,'' said Timothy Douglas, whose
mother lives next door to Amber Haverstock's parents, Greg and
Carrie Haverstock Vergara. ``It was a house dog who never acted like
a pit bull.''
   Amber, the Vergara's only child, died Sunday in Children's
Hospital Medical Center at Akron five hours after being attacked by
the family's 5-year-old, 60-pound American pit bull. Witnesses say
the dog apparently wanted to eat half a cookie the girl had received
from her mother.
   Douglas, 17, said the Vergaras lived in California until moving
into a Canton duplex about a month ago. They were loving parents,
and one of them was always with the baby, Douglas said.
   Summit County Coroner William Cox said the 24-pound baby died of
heart and lung failure caused by injuries stemming from the bites.
   ``I have heard of deaths like this, but I never expected to see
injuries so severe,'' Cox said in a published report. ``It's just
overwhelming to realize that these injuries came from a dog.''
   Private services for the baby will be at 11 a.m. Wednesday.
   City Prosecutor John Poulos said Monday that an investigation
into the incident will be completed after the baby's funeral.
   Canton Health Commissioner Robert Pattison ordered the dog
quarantined at the Stark County Animal Control Center, where it is
being observed for rabies. He said Health Department and animal
control workers will meet with Poulos to determine whether the dog
should be destroyed before the normal quarantine of 10 days elapses.

<HEAD>Overall U.S. Trade Imbalance Falls To Lowest Level in Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade shrank to $30.89 billion from July through September, the
smallest imbalance in three years, the government reported Tuesday.
   While the Reagan administration said the decline was proof that
its efforts to solve the country's trade problems were bearing
fruit, private economists expressed fears that the trade improvement
was in danger of stalling next year.
   The Commerce Department report said America's deficit in its
current account narrowed by 8.4 percent after an 8.6 percent drop in
the second quarter, when the current account deficit was $33.7
billion.
   The current account, also known as the country's balance of
payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures
not only trade in merchandise but also trade in investments and
other services.
   Half of the improvement in the third quarter came from a decline
in the merchandise trade deficit, which dropped to $28.5 billion,
reflecting a record level of U.S. export sales.
   The other half of the improvement came from a swing in the
services category back into surplus. Services, which primarily
reflect investment flows between countries, posted a deficit of $837
million in the second quarter, the first investment deficit in 30
years.
   In the third quarter, services climbed back into the black with a
$757 million surplus, reflecting increased earnings by U.S.
companies on their overseas operations. But economists warned that
the investment category soon will sink back into deficit as America
is forced to service a growing foreign debt burden.
   The third quarter deficit was the smallest imbalance since a
$27.6 billion deficit in the third quarter of 1985.
   For the first nine months of this year, the current account
deficit has been running at an annual rate 12 percent below the
record $153.96 billion imbalance run up in 1987.
   The Reagan administration has credited this improvement with
providing the country with almost half of its overall economic
growth this year, as U.S. manufacturers have hired more workers and
stepped up production to meet a 27 percent jump in export sales.
   But Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association
of Manufacturers, said the big export gains could be ending unless
the new administration aggressively pursues efforts to open foreign
markets to U.S. goods.
   ``The Bush administration is going to have to hit the ground
running on trade policy,'' Jasinowski said. ``Unless policymakers
cooperate, we face the danger of a mid-point stall and a large trade
deficit that will continue to plague us far into the next decade.''
   The government on Wednesday was scheduled to release its estimate
of the monthly merchandise trade deficit for October. In advance of
the report, David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.,
predicted the October merchandise deficit would total $10.5 billion,
the same as the September level. He said the deficits were likely to
be stuck at this level until the dollar declines further.
   Financial markets were braced for any unexpected widening of the
deficit, which at times in the past has sparked a selloff of U.S.
investments by foreign investors and sent the dollar into a tailspin.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, one of the
administration's top trade experts, said predictions that trade
would not show significant improvements next year were too
pessimistic.
   ``The United States is now quite competitive in the world and as
the world's economy keeps growing we will recoup some of the
business that we lost (during the period when the dollar soared to
record levels),'' Ortner said.
   The current account reflects the amount of money that the United
States is transferring into the hands of foreigners to pay for its
trade deficit. In this decade, Americans have handed over billions
of dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods.
   That development has transformed the United States from the
world's largest creditor country, a position now held by Japan, to
the world's largest debtor country.
   Simply put, that means foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments than Americans hold in overseas investments. At the end
of last year, America's net debt had grown to $368.2 billion,
according to Commerce Department figures. The current account
deficits this year are expected to push that debt total to above
$500 billion.
   The country's continuing need to finance its trade deficits with
foreign investment is likely to be the biggest economic problem
facing President-elect Bush.
   The dollar fell sharply in the days following the presidential
election as foreign investors feared that Bush's no-tax pledge and
the larger Democratic majorities insured further deadlock on
resolving the federal budget deficit.
   To reassure jittery markets, Bush has been pledging at every
opportunity that he views tackling the budget deficit as his top
priority.
   For the third quarter, the deficit in merchandise trade declined
to $28.53 billion, its third consecutive quarterly improvement.
Added to this figure was an increase to $3.12 billion in U.S.
foreign aid and pension payments overseas.
   The small $757 million surplus in investments and other services
is subtracted from those deficit figures to arrive at the current
account deficit of $30.89 billion.

   The space shuttle Atlantis today
completed its piggyback ride across the country atop a special
Boeing 747, returning to its Florida launch site a week after
completing its classified military mission.
   The specially modified 747 with the Atlantis on top of it arrived
at the Kennedy Space Center after a three-hop flight across the
country from Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., the shuttle's landing
site.
   The shuttle left Edwards, in the Mojave Desert, on Sunday and
stopped at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz.,
overnight before flying on to Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio
on Monday. It remained there overnight before departing for Florida.
   During the four-day flight, the crew of the Atlantis deployed a
spy satellite, according to sources close to the mission.
   The weather was a concern for the shuttle's trip back to Florida,
with officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
concerned that flying through rain could damage the thousands of
ceramic tiles on the shuttle's belly. The tiles ward off the extreme
heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
   An air-conditioning, heating and filtering unit was flown from
Davis-Monthan and hooked up to the shuttle to maintain its
temperature and filter the air inside the orbiter.
   Atlantis was the second shuttle flight since missions resumed in
September following the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster, which
claimed the lives of seven astronauts.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Dormant Longer Than Thought in Some Infants, Study
Suggests</HEAD>

   The AIDS virus can lie dormant longer than has
been thought in children infected as newborns, implying that a
``large population'' of such children have yet to develop the
disease, a new study asserts.
   Statistical analysis of children infected as newborns suggests
that of those who will develop AIDS by age 10.4, half may remain
healthy until age 4.8, researchers said.
   About 20 percent will develop AIDS within the first year of life
and the rest at about 8 percent a year, the analysis suggested.
   Such incubation periods are longer than those previously reported
in children, and ``strongly suggest there is a large population of
children who are infected but not yet diagnosed'' with AIDS,
researchers wrote in the British journal Nature.
   But they cautioned that their estimates are subject to
substantial error because of lack of solid information about
incubation periods of the AIDS virus.
   One researcher also said it is unclear what fraction of infected
newborns the projections apply to, because nobody knows what
fraction develops AIDS by age 10.4, the cutoff used in the study.
   ``We cannot make any inferences for incubation periods longer
than 10.4 years'' because the disease is too new, said Ivan Auger of
the New York State Department of Health.
   He described the work in last week's Nature with colleagues at
the department, the New York City health department and the Harvard
School of Public Health.
   They developed statistical analyses from the records of 215
children with AIDS who had apparently been infected by their
mothers, which can occur during pregnancy or delivery.
   Currently, most infected newborns who develop AIDS are diagnosed
by age 2, said Margaret Oxtoby of the federal Centers for Disease
Control. Other children have reached ages 7 or 8 before developing
symptoms, she said.
   But the true distribution of incubation periods in children is
not yet known, she said. Current observations underestimate it
because the disease is relatively new, and only children who develop
symptoms soonest after infection are being observed, she said
Tuesday.
   The new study ``just highlights the fact that we haven't seen the
whole epidemic yet,'' she said. ``It's still unfolding in front of
us.''
   While the projections are useful for pointing out that ``there's
more out there than meets the eye ... I would just hesitate in
putting weight on a specific figure,'' she said.
   The analysis suggested that some children may have a brief
incubation period, with half diagnosed within 4.1 months of birth.
But most children appear to have a longer incubation, with half of
them being diagnosed only by about age 6.
   Researchers have no explanation for such a difference, Auger said
Monday.
   Lynne Billard of the University of Georgia in Athens, who has
studied AIDS incubation periods, said she was unaware of any similar
study of children infected by their mothers. The new work is
important for exploring that ground, she said.

   Americans flew the last U.S. cruise
missiles out of Belgium on Tuesday, making it the first Western
nation to be rid of its medium-range nuclear missiles under the
year-old superpower treaty.
   Eight missiles and their launch canisters, sealed in white
containers, were rolled onto a giant C-141 cargo plane at Florennes
Air Base for the flight back to the United States. Florennes is 65
miles south of Brussels.
   ``This marks a very important milestone and a great success for
us,'' said Maynard Glitman, U.S. ambassdor to Belgium and chief
American negotiator in talks leading to the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme said, ``Farewell ceremonies
are very often full of bitterness, even of sadness. Here, however,
in the case of the departure of the last cruise missile based on our
territory, one can speak of hope _ hope for peace.''
   ``Within the Atlantic Alliance ... Belgium is the first country
from which intermediate-range missiles have been withdrawn,'' he
said.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the accord Dec. 8, 1987. It provides for elimination by June 1,
1991, of all U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300
to 3,400 miles.
   ``I'm really proud to take these out of here,'' said Airman 1st
Class Tammy Murray, the loadmaster who flew with the plane from
Travis Air Force Base, Calif.
   Glitman confessed that ``I suppose I should be more emotional.''
But he noted, ``The issues that lie behind the negotiations haven't
gone away either. ... We still have a lot of work to do.''
   Unofficial observers also were moved by the sight of the plane
lifting off.
   ``It's beautiful to see them leave,'' said Paul D'Huyvetter, one
of a small group of demonstrators outside the base.
   D'Huyvetter, who held a small pink carnation to mark the event,
said the missiles' departure ``gives us energy to go on'' and press
for further arms control measures.
   In all, 16 ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares were
kept at Florennes base along with four launchers and eight spares.
   The sleek, ground-hugging weapons arrived in March 1985.
   Col. Calvin Chasteen, commander of the tactical wing, said the
first 12 missiles were removed within the last two weeks.
   Glitman said as far as he knew no other American nuclear devices
remained on the base, which has housed the U.S. Air Force's 485th
Tactical Missile Wing since 1984.
   The missiles are being flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in
Tucson, Ariz., where they will be destroyed.
   The European Repair Facility at Gosslies, 10 miles north of
Florennes, is expected to operate until nearly all missiles covered
by the treaty are removed.
   The 21-foot weapons are jet-propelled, winged missiles with
advanced guidance systems.
   No Soviet inspectors attended the ceremony. They visited the base
earlier this year as part of an unprecedented review process given
each side under the treaty.
   Coeme said the Belgian government was studying options for the
base, which include using it as a storage center for U.S. military
equipment or a training school for test pilots for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

   The Rev. Donald R. Campion, a Jesuit priest,
teacher and journalist who served as editor-in-chief of America
magazine, has died after a long illness. He was 67.
   Campion, who last served as spiritual director for Jesuit
seminarians at Murray-Weigel Hall of Fordham University in the
Bronx, died there on Sunday, the Jesuit Mission Bureau announced.
   The president of Fordham, the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, called
Campion ``one of the great American Jesuits of our time.''
   During the 1960s Campion was Rome correspondent for America, a
Catholic magazine published by the Jesuits, and wrote extensively
about the theological changes of the Second Vatican Council.
   Following a hiatus at Fordham University and the World-Wide
Self-Study of the Society of Jesus, Campion served as
editor-in-chief of America from 1968 to 1975. From 1975 to 1978, he
was director of the press and information office for the Society of
Jesus in Rome.
   Campion then served for six years as secretary for information
and communication of the Jesuit Conference in Washington. In 1984,
ill health forced him to return to Fordham.
   Campion is survived by a sister-in-law, Dolores Campion. Funeral
services will be Wednesday at the Fordham University Church.

<HEAD>Carlucci Orders 3,000 Military Staff Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, resolving
a dispute between his civilian staff and military leaders, has
ordered 3,000 jobs eliminated over the next three years at U.S.
military headquarters around the world.
   The Pentagon, in a brief statement Tuesday, said Carlucci had
sided with civilian manpower officials in ordering the cuts and that
his decision ``is final.''
   The civilian officials had asserted at least 3,000 to 3,500 jobs
could be eliminated from allegedly bloated command staffs, with the
people assigned to more important combat units.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, had countered the reductions
should be limited to no more than 500 positions, or billets.
   ``The secretary of defense has adopted all of the recommendations
that he felt could be accomplished without hurting military
readiness,'' the Pentagon said in response to a query.
   ``With the reduction of 3,000 spaces, the secretary of defense
has determined that he has accomplished his initial review
objectives, which were to reduce manpower levels and overhead costs
by eliminating overlapping responsibilities, duplication of
functions and excessive layering of organization echelons.''
   Carlucci's order had its genesis in an internal study he ordered
last December, shortly after he assumed the post of defense
secretary.
   The study was performed by a 22-member panel chaired by Derek J.
Vander Schaaf, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general. In unusually
blunt terms, it concluded in February the Pentagon could eliminate
7,309 jobs from multiservice military headquarters around the world
_ or 12 percent of the total _ without jeopardizing readiness.
   Such cuts would save more than $300 million a year in operating
costs and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost guarantees
America's military forces will have a hard time fighting any war,
the study concluded.
   The panel found the so-called Unified and Specified Commands
around the world were supported by 59,510 civilian and military
staff, adding: ``The review disclosed significant areas of
overlapping responsibilities, duplication of functions, layering and
opportunities for saving manpower.''
   The panel's conclusion that 7,309 jobs were superfluous
eventually was referred to the Pentagon's manpower office and then
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the six-member body that includes the
nation's highest-ranking admirals and generals.
   The manpower office ``found plenty of room for cutting,'' sources
later disclosed, and urged Carlucci to trim between 3,000 and 3,500
jobs.
   The sources, who asked not to be named, said the Joint Chiefs
``went ballistic, saying that was totally unacceptable.''
   The dispute then went to Carlucci for a final decision.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday the cuts are to be completed by Sept.
30, 1991, and will affect civilian as well as military staff. The
military members will be ``reinvested in validated positions in
combat units or medical units,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``The civilian personnel will be offered other employment
opportunities by the department's Priority Placement Program. We do
not anticipate that many, if any (civilian) personnel will actually
lose their jobs.''
   The Vander Schaff panel had criticized by name several commands
as overstaffed or unnecessary, including the U.S. Forces Caribbean
Command in Key West, Fla.; the Army's Western Command in Hawaii; the
Strategic Air Command, and the separate air and ground defense
command structures for Alaska.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday no final decisions had been made on
whether to close any command headquarters.
   It did disclose, however, the Army and Air Force would bear the
largest percentage of reassignments, 1,123 and 1,168, respectively.
The Navy will be reassigning 654 individuals; the Marine Corps, 41,
and the JCS staff 14.
   The department declined to estimate the dollar savings of the
move.

   Retail sales in November got the crucial
holiday shopping season off to a fast start by posting the second
consecutive strong monthly gain, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said sales jumped 1.1 percent in November
to a seasonally adjusted $138.1 billion. That followed a 1.6 percent
increase in October, revised up from an earlier estimate of 0.9
percent.
   ``It looks like the Christmas season will be better than people
feared and make an important contribution to growth,'' Commerce
Undersecretary Robert Ortner said.
   ``Everybody keeps writing off the consumer sector of the economy,
but consumers don't know they are supposed to stop spending,''
Ortner said. ``Their incomes are growing and they are optimistic.''
   Christmas sales provide general merchandisers with about half of
their annual profits. Many economists had expected sluggish sales,
in part because the Federal Reserve has been nudging interest rates
higher since March.
   The Fed fears that excessive consumer demand could lead to higher
inflation, and make it difficult to stem the flood of foreign
imports and shrink the nation's trade deficit. The Federal Open
Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, was meeting behind
closed doors Tuesday.
   ``The Fed is not going to be pleased with this development in
retail sales,'' said John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa Group,
a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``This is probably another
reason for them to continue to tighten _ and maybe a little more
quickly than they had previously planned.''
   But S.J. Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., said
overall sales gains have been bolstered by auto buying. Excluding
autos, sales have risen at an annual rate of about 7 percent over
the last six months, which is little better than the inflation and
job growth rates.
   ``That's not a startling figure,'' he said.
   Auto sales last month rose 2.0 percent to $30.9 billion after a
4.6 percent increase a month earlier. But even excluding autos,
aggregate sales rose a strong 0.9 percent in November and 0.8
percent in October.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up
1.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $15.8 billion,
following a 2.6 percent rise in October.
   In a separate report earlier this month, major department store
chains reported mostly sluggish sales through much of November and
then a surge over the Thanksgiving weekend as holiday shoppers
flooded the stores.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to last
three or more years, rose 1.8 percent in November after a 2.5
percent October rise. Non-durable goods climbed 0.7 percent
following a 1.1 percent jump.
   Hardware, garden and building supply store sales surged 2.8
percent, while furniture sales increased 1.2 percent.
   Food and grocery stores reported a 0.7 percent increase,
specialty clothing stores a 1.7 percent rise, drug stores a 1.3
percent gain, and restaurants and bars a 1.0 percent increase
   The only category reporting a decline was gasoline service
stations, where sales fell 1.4 percent.

   The United States and China have opened a
research laboratory in Beijing to help find natural enemies of
insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Orville G. Bentley, assistant secretary for science and
education, said the new Sino-American Biological Control
Collaborative Laboratory is located at the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
   Under a five-year agreement with the academy, three USDA
scientists will go to the laboratory next May and conduct research
there for six months each year. They will work in the United States
the remaining six months of the year.
   Richard S. Soper, biocontrol research leader in the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said the Beijing laboratory will be a
quarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrol
organisms between the two countries.
   The targeted U.S. pests include: leafy spurge, a noxious
rangeland weed; two water weeds, hydrilla and watermilfoil; and the
Russian wheat aphid. Soper said the aphid is ``the most worrisome
pest.'' It was first spotted in the United States in 1986 and has
spread rapidly to wheat-growing areas.
   Pests of concern to China are: croftonweed, a weed so toxic to
horses that they can't be kept on certain land; scale insects; and
apple leaf mites.
   Next year the Chinese academy is expected to send scientists to
USDA laboratories in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
   Soper said scientists at four agency laboratories in France,
Italy, South Korea and Argentina are searching overseas to find
biocontrols for U.S. pests. But until now, he said, scientists have
not been able to easily explore kmust of the vast Eurasian land area.
   ``The new lab takes care of much of Asia that we've missed, and
we're hoping we can develop similar arrangements with the Soviets,''
he said.

   Thirteen states have been granted a total of
$2.9 million to help finance mediation efforts between financially
strapped farmers and their creditors, the Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   La Verne Ausman, acting administrator of the Farmers Home
Administration, said the funds _ to be matched by the states _ will
be used to ``resolve differences between other lenders and farmers''
who have loans from the USDA agency.
   The money, he said, ``will help make it possible for a neutral,
third party mediator to cast a fresh eye on the problem. Many
disputes are resolved in this manner.''
   For example, the FmHA and other lenders might agree to write
down, or reduce, a borrower's debt or in some other way work
together to help the farmer meet his obligations.
   The matching grants were authorized in the Agricultural Credit
Act passed by Congress last year.
   States qualifying for the FmHA grants in the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1 are: Alabama, $110,208; Iowa, $305,000; Kansas,
$431,150; Minnesota, $500,000; Mississippi, $75,040; Montana,

   The city violated the constitutional rights
of an abortion protester arrested for not having a parade permit for
a two-person demonstration, a federal court has ruled.
   The U.S. District Court on Monday ordered Jackson to pay $5,000
in damages to Carol Ann Schlissmann, 33.
   Schlissmann said the ruling upholds the right to demonstrate
based on religious beliefs.
   ``If you're a Christian, you don't have to be a doormat,'' she
said following Monday's ruling. ``The Constitution protects all of
us.''
   City officials could not be reached by telephone for comment.
   Schlissmann, who now lives in Michigan, was arrested in May 1987
during a protest at Mississippi Women's Medical Center in Jackson
under a city law that bans public demonstrations without a permit.
She sued the city in July 1987, seeking $1.2 million in damages.
   The city had offered to drop the charge if Schlissmann dropped
her suit, but she declined.
   Attorney Tom Lowe of Jackson, representing Schlissmann,
questioned how the city could arrest Schlissmann and Roy McMillan,
executive director of the Mississippi Abortion Abolition Society,
for demonstrating because the protest involved only two people.
   McMillan and Schlissmann held signs reading, ``Pray to End
Abortion'' and ``Abortion Destroys God's Handiwork.'' The two also
had a small coffin draped with an American flag.
   About 15 minutes after the two began to hand out literature in
front of the clinic, police arrested them for not having a parade
permit, McMillan said.
   The four-man, two-woman jury deliberated 15 minutes before
returning its verdict.

   Space shuttle Atlantis, its right
fuselage in need of repairs, returned to its launch site Tuesday
atop a Boeing 747 jetliner after two overnight stops.
   The 747 touched down at the Kennedy Space Center here at 2:25
p.m. to complete a hopscotch flight that began Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Atlantis landed at Edwards, in the Mojave Desert, a week ago
after completing a four-day classified flight during which the five
military astronauts aboard reportedly deployed a sophisticated
reconnaissance satellite.
   Enroute back here, the jetliner made overnight stops at
Davis-Monthon Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz., and at Kelly Air
Force Base near San Antonio, Tex.
   When Atlantis returned to Earth, NASA found it had suffered
heavier than expected damage to the heat-resistant tiles on its
right fuselage, and the vehicle's processing director, Conrad Nagel,
estimated between 125 and 175 of them will have to be replaced.
   NASA engineers suspect something struck that area of the shuttle
during launch, possibly insulation falling off the external fuel
tank. An agency team has been named to investigate the cause.
   Debris found imbedded in a shuttle tile has been sent to a
laboratory for analysis, and films and photographs of the launch are
being studied for clues.
   Atlantis is covered with about 28,000 tiles designed to protect
it from heat up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit when it leaves orbit and
re-enters Earth's atmosphere.
   Officials said the repair work should not affect preparations for
launching Atlantis on its next flight during which astronauts will
dispatch the Magellan spacecraft to explore the planet Venus. The
launch is scheduled April 28.
   Discovery, which was launched on the first post-Challenger flight
on Sept. 29, is scheduled to be launched again on Feb. 18, with a
communications satellite as its cargo.

<HEAD>Rural Minnesota County Tries To Beef Up Population With
Homesteading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A declining population has led
a northern Minnesota county to try a version of the nation's old
homestead policy: Anyone can claim up to 40 acres of land if they
build a house and live in it for 10 years.
   ``Our real problem up here is that nobody's here anymore,'' said
Lee Hervey, one of the residents of rural Koochiching County who
proposed the homesteading plan.
   The 2 million-acre county along the Canadian border _ three times
as big as Rhode Island _ has about 15,700 residents, only eight
communities and vast stretches where no one lives.
   It also has about 50,000 acres of woods and farmland abandoned to
the county when its owners failed to pay taxes. That's the land the
county wants to give away.
   ``There are people that live in Chicago, New York or the Twin
Cities that might be sick and tired of the rat race, the rush-hour
traffic ... and, believe me, we'll eliminate that from the lifestyle
real quick,'' said Bob Schwiderski, who directs the homestead
program.
   Added Hervey, ``We really don't have a lot to offer up here
besides the land, so we decided that's what we should offer. The
population's dropping and that hurts the schools, the power company,
everything. If we don't get neighbors, we won't be able to live here
either.''
   More than 180 people have inquired about the homesteading
program, and two dozen have formally applied. County officials say
they hope to hand over the first deeds within a week.
   While other rural areas in the country have offered tax breaks
and other financial assistance to lure residents, federal officials
and development experts said they believed this was the first
large-scale land giveaway since the federal homestead program was
eliminated.
   Homesteading was the catalyst that spurred the settlement of the
Plains and the West. The Homestead Act of 1862 offered up to 160
acres of free farmland to settlers willing to develop the property
and live there for at least five years.
   During the first five years of homesteading, settlers rushed into
Minnesota faster than into any other state _ more than 62,000 of
them by 1880.
   In 1976, long after homesteading had ceased, Congress abolished
the act. Only in Alaska does it continue, under a state-directed
program.
   In Koochiching County, officials hope that International Falls
will boom again once Boise Cascade completes a $525 million
expansion of its big paper mill. But the county's other vital signs
aren't good. Since 1980, the population has dropped by about 2,000
residents.
   Koochiching County isn't the only area of Minnesota seeking new
residents. In October, the central Minnesota town of Osakis began
offering $5,000 in cash to anyone willing to build a house and
settle.
   Koochiching officials persuaded state legislators last year to
sponsor a special local law that allowed them to implement the
homestead program, formally called the Bidstead and Economic
Development Program.
   Under the rules, not only must applicants agree to homebuilding,
taxpaying and occupying their new home, they also must ``maintain an
income sufficient'' to live there. And before their application is
approved, they must submit to a credit and criminal-records check.
   ``We want people that are self-sufficient,'' Schwiderski said.
``We're not looking for an opportunity to increase our welfare rolls
up here.''
   ``There's really not any jobs up here as such.'' added Hervey,
42, who is self-employed. ``We expect them to bring their livelihood
with them.''
   If 250 families applied and settled in the county, ``I would
consider the program successful,'' Schwiderski said.
   Among applicants so far are retirees and couples interested in
relocating their small businesses, Schwiderski said.
   One of the applicants, Tom Johnson Jr., said he returned to his
family's Koochiching County home from Florida because the homestead
program would give him a chance he wouldn't otherwise have to make a
living where he grew up.
   Johnson, 23, has his eye on 40 acres next to his father's
property. He plans to build an earth-berm, passive-solar house on
the land, supporting himself by working for his father's logging
operation.
   ``Ten years is a long time, but I'm planning to stay here the
rest of my life if I can,'' he said.

<HEAD>NATO Should Follow Soviet Example With Troop Reductions, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO should respond to announced Soviet troop
cuts by reducing its own military forces and match the Soviet plan
to move to strictly defensive forces, a liberal study group said
Tuesday.
   In addition, European members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization should be prepared to pick up a greater share of the
burden of defending the Western alliance, the Institute for Peace
and International Security said.
   Economist John Kenneth Galbraith and Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a
frequent critic of Reagan administration defense policies, head the
advisory board of the Cambridge, Mass.-based research center.
   Mrs. Schroeder, who released the study at a news conference,
noted the announcement last week by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that the Soviet Union was cutting its armed forces by 10
percent worldwide. Some of the reductions will be in Eastern Europe,
and the Soviet forces also will be restructured to make them
defensive, rather than offensive, Gorbachev said.
   ``As we face the largest budget deficit in our nation's history,
Mr. Gorbachev's initiative gives us the opportunity to cut our
defense budget without endangering our national security,'' Mrs.
Schroeder said.
   ``Our European allies must still face up to new
responsibilities,'' she added.
   ``In the face of a new, positive arms control climate and the
emergence of Western Europe as a unified world trading entity, our
European allies must prepare themselves not only for this new role,
but for roles and responsibilities that come with being a global
power,'' she said.
   The study proposed several responses to Gorbachev's plan,
including:
   _An immediate ``confidence-building withdrawal'' of 5 percent of
the active ground forces in central Europe by both sides, which
would be 20,000 Soviet troops and 10,000 U.S. troops. Gorbachev had
pledged to implement his reductions by 1991.
   _A pause in deployment of new short-range nuclear weapons by NATO
and the Soviet bloc. Medium-range missiles are being eliminated by a
U.S.-Soviet treaty signed a year ago, but the pact doesn't affect
weapons with so-called battlefield range.
   _Movement to dominance by defense, rather than offense, in the
military structure of each side. One example would be a decrease in
heavily armored forces, including tanks and artillery, because those
forces normally are employed in attack.
   A prime focus of arms control efforts should be the withdrawal of
offensive weapons, the study said.
   One of the hurdles to be overcome is the belief by Western
leaders that NATO forces already are at the minimum level, despite
the Warsaw Pact reductions, the study said.
   Another potential problem it cited was the possibility that
``NATO may be reluctant to break its morbid dependence on nuclear
weapons, even if progress in conventional arms negotiations
undermines the present rationale for those weapons.''

<HEAD>US Firm, Soviets Establish Joint Venture To Venture Jointly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington's largest law firm announced Tuesday
a joint venture with a Soviet enterprise aimed at creating a variety
of U.S.-Soviet businesses, ranging from pollution control to caviar
production.
   Speaking at a news conference with a telephone hookup to Moscow,
officials of the 300-lawyer firm of Arnold & Porter said U.S. and
Soviet officials of the new venture would meet with prospective
clients later this week.
   New Soviet economic policies of openness, or ``perestroika,''
offer ``access to a market of 280 million highly educated Soviet
consumers with an enormous need for goods and technology,'' said
James Jones, Arnold & Porter managing partner.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's policies are
``setting an exciting new course for East-West business
relationships.''
   The firm's consulting affiliate, APCO Associates, hopes to double
the number of U.S.-Soviet ventures by the end of next year. Ten
joint U.S.-Soviet business agreements have been concluded to date,
along with about 100 Soviet ventures with businesses from other
countries.
   Soviet law expert Randy Bregman, who will direct APCO's new
Soviet and East European operations, said he looks to the day when a
Soviet citizen can buy borscht made by Campbell Soup Co.
   He said Campbell is not one of the companies now involved, but
this is an example of the kind of enterprise that might result from
the new agreement with INFEKS, a six-month old Soviet consulting
cooperative affiliated with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations.
   Bregman declined to name companies that might deal with the
Soviets through APCO, but he said they include about a dozen
companies involved in food processing, pollution control, medical
equipment, tourism and telecommunications. One U.S. company even
wants to get into caviar production, he said.
   Current Soviet law requires that joint ventures be no more than
49 percent foreign owned, but Bregman said there have been strong
indications this might be liberalized early next year. He said some
contracts already have been written with majority foreign ownership.
   Vladimir Gusinsky, INFEKS president, said from Moscow that the
Soviet enterprise is part of the economic perestroika under way in
the Soviet Union.
   ``We are looking forward to developing economic relations with
U.S. companies,'' Gusinsky said through a translator who also
translated the Washington news conference in Russian over the
telephone hookup.
   APCO President Margery Kraus said the company, which also has set
up joint ventures with Japanese and Iraeli businesses, would open an
office in Moscow early next year.
   She said the company would provide ``one-stop shopping'' for
companies wanting to do business in the Soviet Union, charging fees
for its services. She said there were no plans for APCO to share in
profits of the joint ventures it helps set up.
   Bregman, who has been dealing with Soviet commerce for 25 years,
said the climate for business has changed dramatically under
Gorbachev, with many cooperatives and other enterprises set up with
only partial state involvement. Those run by people with more
initiative are seeking foreign business ties, he said.
   A few years ago, Bregman said, when Moscow citizens saw a man in
a suit, they would approach the individual and say, ``Do you want to
change money?''
   Now, he said, they ask, ``Do you want to do joint ventures?''

<HEAD>Disaster a Lightning Rod for Gripes About Railways</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three-train fatal accident in south London has
become a lightning rod for commuters' grievances over rising fares
and ``sardine express'' service.
   ``We have to stop talking about the profit-and-loss account and
thinking about whether we can go on patching up a 150-year-old
railway system the way British Rail has to,'' said Robert Adley, a
member of Parliament for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party.
   Some of Adley's constituents from Dorset ride British Rail
through busy Clapham Junction, where the accident involving two
commuter trains and a freight train occurred Monday, killing 33
people.
   ``The system has been creaking at the seams for so long that
something had to give,'' said John Stewart, policy coordinator for
Capital, a public transport pressure group.
   British Rail brings 467,000 commuters to London every morning
rush hour, an increase of 19 percent since 1983.
   ``Death on the Sardine Express,'' blared the tabloid Today. Even
the Conservative-leaning Daily Telegraph said Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government ``has yet to reveal the commitment to
public services, transport prominent among them, that it has so
admirably displayed in creating a new spirit within the private
sector.''
   On the morning of the crash, railroad union members dressed as
sardines were handing out leaflets at London's Euston Station
complaining about crowding on trains.
   ``Conditions for many commuters are very, very bad. We need new
trains, more staff and longer platforms,'' Neil Milligan, general
secretary of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and
Firemen, said at the Euston demonstration.
   On a small island crowded with 56 million people, commuters must
choose between roads spread thick with traffic jams and
standing-room-only service on British rail.
   Passenger traffic on Network SouthEast, the British Rail division
which serves London and its suburbs, is up 19 percent since 1983.
Capital investment has also grown rapidly, from $644 million
system-wide in 1983 to $1.15 billion this fiscal year.
   British Rail, meanwhile, has been hard-pressed to fill staff
vacancies, particularly among telecommunications and signal workers,
some of them lured away by higher wages offered by the recently
privatized telephone company, British Telecom.
   Earlier this month, British Rail announced incentives worth $450
to $2,175 a year for workers in southern England. In November, as
part of an effort to fill 200 vacancies for train drivers, British
Rail announced plans to develop 73 low-cost apartments and 15 houses
in London.
   Meanwhile, the 10,000-mile British Rail system has pledged to cut
its government subsidy by 25 percent between 1987 and 1990.
   The burden lifted from the taxpayer has fallen increasingly on
the ticket-buyer. British Rail is raising fares by an average of 9
percent on Jan. 8, compared to an inflation rate around 6 percent,
but fares for long-distance commuters are soaring as much as 21
percent.
   The 155-mile round trip from Swindon to London, for instance,
will go from $3,996 a year to $4,825.
   The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail system's
statutory watchdog, said in its 1988 report that crowding had become
an epidemic in the southeast.
   ``The existing load factor standards, 110 percent for slam-door
stock, 135 percent for (newer) sliding-door trains, were intended as
maximum loadings _ not average targets to be aimed at,'' the report
said.
   Robin Seymour, the chief inspector of railways, acknowledged
concern about overcrowding in his report. However, he said, ``there
is no evidence to suggest that overcrowding per se may be the cause
of train accidents.''
   Seymour reported there were 1,164 accidents on British Rail and
the London subways in 1987, the lowest total in five years. Deaths
went up from 72 in 1986 to 104, largely due to 31 deaths in the
King's Cross subway station fire.
   The Clapham disaster may have been caused by signal improvements,
part of $37 million being spent on some of the lines leading to
London's Waterloo station.

   Leslie Hodge, who conducted orchestras around
the world and was the first resident director of the San Diego
Philharmonic, was killed in a traffic accident. He was 75.
   Hodge, a La Jolla, Calif., resident, was killed last Tuesday when
his car was involved in a collision with a truck stopped on
Interstate 5 in the Sorrento Valley area, 13 miles north of San
Diego.
   He served as resident director of the San Diego Philharmonic,
predecessor to the San Diego Symphony, from 1950 to 1952, and
presented the first series of children's concerts. He also offered
the first winter concerts in San Diego.
   Hodge, a native of Australia, began studying piano at age 4 and
was performing in concert at age 11.
   He was the founding conductor of the Guadalajara Symphony in
Mexico, and was conductor of the Phoenix Symphony from 1952 to 1959.
He spent six years as a guest conductor in West Germany and other
countries.
   Hodge had taught piano for the last 18 years.
   Hodge's survivors include his wife, Barbara, and four
stepdaughters.

   A nuclear power plant built on a
geological fault near the Armenian capital will be shut down in two
years because of the danger, according to Soviet Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov.
   There were many rumors in Armenia and outside the Soviet Union
about damage to the plant after a powerful earthquake shook
northwestern Armenia on Dec. 7. The quake was felt in Yerevan, but
officials said the plant withstood it.
   Local officials have said in recent weeks that a decision had
been made to shut the plant, which Armenian activists have demanded.
But Ryzhkov's statment to reporters at a news conference at the
Armenian Communist Party Central Committee headquarters on Monday
were the highest-level confirmation of that.
   The plant cannot be shut down immediately because it supplies too
much of the republic's electricity, Ryzkhov said.
   ``If it was shut down, life would stop in the republic,'' he said.
   Foreign Ministry officials said after the earthquake the plant
was undamaged and working at full capacity.

   Consumers became more cautious about their
economic futures in November following the presidential election and
the renewed debate over the budget deficit, a business-financed
research group reported Wednesday.
   The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index declined
to 113.1 in November, from a revised 116.9 in October.
   The monthly survey, which covers 5,000 U.S. households, is
conducted for the board by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo,
Ohio.
   The survey indicated that although consumers showed more
confidence in present employment conditions last month than in
October, they turned less confident about the outlook for the next
six months, the report said.
   Of those responding, 30.2 percent indicated jobs were plentiful
in November, compared with 29.8 percent in October. However, only
15.5 percent believed employment conditions would improve over the
next six months, down from 18.6 percent in October.
   Solme 18.5 percent of those polled said they expected business
conditions to improve in the next six months, down from 21.1 percent
who thought so in October. Those expecting conditions to worsen rose
to 8.5 percent from 7.0 percent in October.
   ``Growing uncertainty about the immediate future appears to be
the reason for the latest dip in consumer spirits,'' said Fabian
Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
   ``The budget and trade deficits and other major economic
problems, largely ignored by both candidates during the presidential
campaign, are now emerging as urgent issues,'' he said.
   Consumer buying plans largely were unchanged from October. The
percentage of people planning to buy automobiles and major
appliances in November remained at 7.3 percent and 27 percent
respectively.
   But rising mortgage interest rates pushed the percentage of those
planning to buy homes down to 2.9 from 3.7 percent.

<HEAD>Protests Held to Mark Anniversary of Martial-Law Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students chanting ``Solidarity!'' hurled
stones at riot police Tuesday and were answered with tear gas in a
demonstration at Warsaw University on the seventh anniversary of
Poland's martial-law crackdown.
   Thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in Wroclaw and at
least four other cities, opposition activists said, as the official
press defended the military crackdown ordered Dec. 13, 1981, by
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   A government spokesman said five policemen were injured badly
enough in Warsaw to require hospitalization and five people _
probably students _ were detained.
   About 2,000 students squared off against several hundred
shield-carrying, helmeted police at the gates of Warsaw University.
   Students hoisted banners saying ``Solidarity'' and ``There is no
freedom without Solidarity'' during a rally organized by the
outlawed Polish Socialist Party just off campus at a monument to the
16th century astronomer Copernicus.
   Banners also were raised for other illegal opposition groups,
including the Socialist Party, the Independent Students Association
and the Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   Police chased the students back into the walled campus, dragging
some of them away. Then students began throwing stones from within
the gates and police answered with tear gas, which filled the chilly
air with stinging smoke.
   Students picked up canisters and threw them back at police, and
after about an hour the situation degenerated into a standoff with
students chanting slogans and the police facing them from behind
their shields across the street.
   Several sweeps by phalanxes of police cleared the sidewalks by
late afternoon, and most of the students drifted away through back
entrances of the university to end the protest.
   In the southwestern city of Wroclaw, an opposition spokeswoman
said 15,000 people rallied with banners saying ``Jaruzelski Must
Go,'' and police did not interfere.
   ``The speeches concentrated on what happened on Dec. 13, 1981,
and the fact that it is high time for democracy to be implemented,''
said Maria Pinior, whose husband, Jozef, was one of the leaders of
the protest.
   The demonstration also included one minute of silence for those
killed during the martial law crackdown, she said.
   The Solidarity Information Service in Warsaw reported smaller
rallies in Lodz, Jastrzebie and Lublin. Zygmunt Lenyk, a spokesman
for the Confederation for an Independent Poland in Krakow, said
2,500 people there marched to the site of Solidarity's former
headquarters.
   ``We survived seven years and we are still here,'' Lenyk quoted
Solidarity activist Jerzy Smagowicz as telling the crowd.
   In a commentary, the Communist Party daily newspaper Trybuna Ludu
said ``one can remember Dec. 13 for years with a measure of
bitterness and divisions. One can open the healing wounds anew.''
   ``But would it not be better for Poland ... if the date of the
lesser evil were overshadowed by a joyful day, the day of
eliminating national discord and of common action for Poland?''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said, ``We consider the
imposition of martial law to have been a necessary evil, an evil
that turned out to be effective. Today's progress toward
reconciliation would not have been possible without martial law.''
   On Dec. 13, 1981, Poles woke up to find tanks in the streets,
martial music on the radio and thousands of active members of
Solidarity rounded up and interned.
   The lightning blow by the army under Jaruzelski's command put an
end overnight to the legal operation of the East bloc's first
independent trade union, a 10 million-strong social movement that
had electrified the country for 15 months.
   Solidarity was at first suspended and was banned the following
October.
   The operation took place with little bloodshed. Nine coal miners
were killed during a strike at the Wujek mine near Katowice on Dec.
16, 1981, but otherwise there were no known casualties during
introduction of the officially named ``state of war.'' Martial law
was formally lifted in July 1983.
   Officials argued the Solidarity leadership had been taken over by
elements who threatened the political supremacy of the Polish United
Workers (Communist) Party. If Poles had not acted to restore order,
the Soviet Union and its allies would have been forced to intervene
at a higher cost, they said.
   Solidarity remains illegal but is increasingly tolerated by
authorities.
   The union demonstrated it still has a following after leading two
waves of strikes in 1988, the strongest since the martial-law
crackdown. Walesa ended the second wave of strikes when the
government agreed to talk with him.
   On Nov. 30, authorities allowed him to participate in a
nationwide TV debate with official unions chief Alfred Miodowicz,
which Walesa was widely considered to have won.
   But the proposed talks with the government have stalled, with
Walesa insisting that he first wants a signal that authorities are
willing to legalize his union again.
   Solidarity plans ceremonies Friday in Gdansk to honor the victims
of Dec. 16, 1970, food riots and the miners killed resisting martial
law in 1980.

<TEXT>
   Remains of about 100 Jews killed by the
Nazis during World War II were reburied Tuesday in a ceremony
attended by 15 rabbis from around the world.
   The bones were discovered near the site of the old Jewish Ghetto
in Warsaw last summer during a construction project which since has
been abandoned.
   Historians determined that the site was a mass grave used by the
Nazis for Polish Jews who were shot or died of starvation in the
ghetto. Some non-Jewish Poles also were believed to be buried there.
   In the ceremony carried out during a light snowfall, about 100
wooden boxes of remains were carried by several dozen people from a
temporary storage area to a specially build crypt at the site.
   The rabbis removed the bones from the boxes, wrapped them in
white cloths and lowered them into pre-formed concrete cubicles. The
entire site is to become a monument to the victims of genocide.
   The ceremony, attended by Warsaw Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski and
other dignitarites, was organized by the Polish Veterans
Organization and by the Nissenbaum Foundation, which restores and
preserves Jewish monuments in Poland.
   ``We want to express our appreciation to the Polish government
for its courageous stand in preserving this entire area,'' said
Rabbi Hertz Frankel of New York, speaking at the ceremony.
   ``We participate in sorrow and mourning of our elder brothers,
who gave us the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,''' said Bishop
Henryk Muszczynski of Warsaw, who also took part in the prayers of
mourning led by the rabbis.
   Before World War II, Poland was home to 3.5 million Jews. About 3
million were slaughtered by the Nazis. Most of the rest left Poland
after the war, and today the Jewish population is estimated at about
10,000.

<HEAD>Officials Blame Condemned Man's Drug Use, Muscles For Leaky Lethal
Injection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A condemned inmate's muscular arms and
previous drug use caused a tube carrying a deadly solution into his
arm to spring a leak, prolonging his execution by injection, state
officials said Tuesday.
   Raymond Landry, 39, was declared dead at 12:45 a.m., 24 minutes
after prison officials began administering the lethal dosage.
   Two minutes into the procedure, the tube attached to his right
arm sprang a leak, spraying the solution toward witnesses and
halting the execution. Witnesses heard murmurs and at least one
groan before Landry was pronounced dead.
   ``It was a mechanical and physical problem,'' Ron Dusek, a
spokesman for Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, said Tuesday.
``Landry was very muscular and had `Popeye-type' arms. When the
stuff was flowing, it wouldn't go into the veins and there was more
pressure in the hose than his veins could absorb.''
   Dusek called the prolonged execution an accident.
   ``There's not much you can say about it,'' Dusek said. ``This has
been done 29 times now without any major screw-up or problem. It
couldn't be helped.''
   But Landry's attorney, Mike Charlton, said the state had the
responsibility to carry out executions with dispatch and dignity.
   ``This is somewhat bizarre,'' he said. ``I don't know how you can
describe your feelings about something like that. It had to absolute
hell for Raymond.
   ``To sit there and to have to go through that is an ordeal you
would not wish on anybody. I think it's bad enough to find yourself
in that situation, but to go through a situation like that... If our
society ever gets to the stage where we execute people without
regard to the emotional implications, then we will have reached a
sad day.''
   The Supreme Court Monday denied Landry's request for a reprieve,
but another inmate, Samuel Hawkins, scheduled to die immediately
after Landry, received a stay about 3{ hours before he was to be
executed. Hawkins, 45, faced death for the 1976 rape and slaying of
a 19-year-old woman.
   Landry was convicted in the shooting death of Kosmas Prittis.
Prittis, 33, a Greek immigrant, was robbed and shot in the head on
Aug. 6, 1982, as his wife and children watched.
   Landry was the 104th person executed in the United States since
the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 and 11th
this year.

<HEAD>China Buys 400,000 Tons of Subsidized U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exporters have sold China an additional 400,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for shipment in
January and February, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
four companies: Cargill Inc., 190,000 tons; Central States
Enterprises Inc., 40,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000; and Ferruzzi
USDA Inc., 130,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an
authorized 1 million tons of wheat announced on Dec. 7 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. About 10,000 tons also remained
of an earlier EEP authorization.
   Thus, he said, China has 610,000 tons of wheat remaining under
the EEP arrangement.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $3.94 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $58 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the four exporters for the latest deal
averaged $21.10 per ton of wheat, or about 57 cents per bushel.

<HEAD>President Calls Failure to Tape Deficit a `Great Disappointment'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, looking back on his eight
years in the White House, said Tuesday that one of his ``great
disappointments'' is leaving office without taming the federal
budget deficit.
   Reagan had come into office promising to balance the nation's
red-ink spending by 1984.
   The president, who leaves office in less than six weeks,
contended that a ``Washington colony'' composed of an ``iron
triangle'' of members of Congress, the news media and special
interest groups had helped perpetuate the deficit.
   ``When I came to office, I found the presidency a weakened
institution,'' Reagan told his audience of several hundred
government officials and employees at Constitution Hall.
   ``I found a Congress that was trying to transform our government
into a quasi-parliamentary system. And I found a Washington colony
that _ through the iron triangle _ was attempting to rule the nation
according to its interests and desires more than the nation's.''
   Reagan said some had used the term ``iron triangle'' to describe
the triad of the Congress, news media and special interest groups,
and that he would borrow the phrase.
   ``Administrations come and go, but the iron triangle remains,''
he said.
   Reagan said he believed that he has been able ``to use the
president's ability to frame the broadest outlines of debate to
compensate for some of the weakening of the office.''
   He accused the triad of perpetuating ``their game of tax and
spend,'' and fighting his efforts to balance the budget through
spending cuts and proposals for a balanced-budget amendment to the
Constitution and authority to veto individual items in major
spending bills.
   Reagan received a tumultuous reception, with applause punctuated
by cheers and whistles, from his audiences of government officials
and employees in Constitution Hall.
   ``One of my great disappointments as I leave office is that the
federal budget itself is not yet balanced,'' the president said.
   ``The House of Representatives, he said, ``has become a virtually
permament chamber no longer truly responsive to the people.''
   ``With a 98 percent rate of re-election, there is less turnover
in the House than in the Supreme Soviet,'' he said.
   The president said the ``iron triangle'' also derives from the
power of special interest groups to ``focus debate and overwhelming
resources like campaign money and letter-writing campaigns on issues
that don't command broad and intense national attention.''
   With this pressure, he said, liberal members of Congress ``take
up the banner'' in support of continued spending programs.
   ``You would think the media might act as a check on all this,''
he said. ``But too often it doesn't.''
   While expressing respect for the news media, Reagan said ``too
many members of the media approach issues like federal spending from
a superficial perspective.''
   ``Our positions are reported in caricature,'' he said. ``Special
interest charges are reported uncritically, and the public's
understanding suffers.''
   ``Shouldn't we expect better of those who act in the name of the
public's right to know?'' the president asked.
   His audience cheered the question.
   ``In the long run, the situation we have now isn't good for
anyone _ even the members of the iron triangle,'' Reagan said.
``Fundamentally, the American people know what's up, and they don't
like it. They may re-elect their congressmen, but they trust
Congress itself less and less.''
   ``They may watch or read the media, but they stop believing it,''
he said, ``and they show more and more dislike for special interest
influence. The only question is, when will they say once and for all
that they've had enough.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Asks for Inquiry into Reports AP Correspondent Died in
Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International has called for an
investigation of reports that journalist Salet Gaba, a longtime
local correspondent for The Associated Press in Chad, has died in
prison in the African country.
   The London-based human rights organization said its reports
suggest Gaba died about six months ago, nearly a year after he was
arrested and accused of taking part in an armed rebellion.
   Michael Goldsmith, the AP North Africa correspondent, said he was
unable to confirm rumors of Gaba's death or get any information
about the reporter's fate during several meetings last month with
Chadian officials in the capital, N'Djamena.
   After Gaba's arrest last year, the AP and London-based
International Press Institute called for his release. Amnesty
International urged President Hissene Habre to take steps to ensure
his safety, noting that political detainees had disappeared or been
executed without charge or trial.
   Habre told a news conference a year ago that Gaba ``was captured
in a state of rebellion'' and would be tried for illegal possession
of arms. Previously official Chad Radio had reported that Gaba was
accused of killing two people.
   He was not charged or brought to trial and was allowed no access
to a lawyer or his family, Amnesty said.
   The French-educated journalist is a Chadian national who has been
a reporter for the AP for about 20 years and also worked for the
French Agence France-Presse. He is in his mid-40s.
   Amnesty said Gaba was among more than 50 members of his minority
tribe arrested during June and July 1987.
   ``Amnesty International has received no evidence, however, to
suggest that Salet Gaba was involved in violent activities,'' the
statement said.

<DATELINE>OTTERLO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police hunting burglars who stole
three Vincent van Gogh paintings said Tuesday they are hampered by
the size of the scene of the crime: a museum surrounded by the
country's biggest national park.
   Karel van Seventer said, however, the police's rapid response
apparently stopped the thieves taking a fourth painting by the 19th
century Dutch impressionist master.
   ``Weaver's Interior,'' which Seventer earlier identified as one
of the stolen works, was found lying on the floor of the room from
which the other three had disappeared, he said.
   In probably the biggest art theft in the Netherlands, thieves
Monday night broke into the Kroeller-Mueller museum and stole the
oil paintings ``The Potato Eaters,'' ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and ``The
Loom,'' Seventer said. Earlier, he wrongly identified the flower
painting as ``Dried Sunflowers.''
   Alerted by an alarm when burglars smashed a ground-floor window,
police rushed to the museum within minutes and sealed off the
12,350-acre expanse of forests, shrubs and heath of Hoge Veluwe
park, he said. Guards posted in the sprawling single-story museum
said they did not hear the thieves, he said.
   ``It all happened very fast ... We were acting on the assumption
that they were possibly still on the grounds right after the
alarm,'' Seventer told a news conference.
   ``The trouble was the grounds are 5,000 hectares large and made
up of difficult terrain,'' he said. The park has only three roads
accessible by motor vehicle.
   Two helicopter sweeps of the area, which normally is inhabited
only by five gamekeepers and their families, produced no clues.
Police used tracker dogs, also to no avail.
   No official valuation has been disclosed for the works, which
were not insured by the state because of the astronomical premiums
they would command. However, a Dutch art expert speculated ``The
Potato Eaters'' alone could be worth more than the $39.9 million
paid for van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' at a London auction last year.
   But it would be virtually impossible to sell it on the open
market.
   The spectacular theft was the second in seven months' involving
works by van Gogh and underscored relatively lax security at museums.
   In May, thieves broke into Amsterdam's Municipal Museum and stole
van Gogh's ``Carnations'' and two other impressionist paintings. All
three were recovered undamaged a few weeks later.
   Most officials declined to speculate on why the paintings were
stolen, since it would be virtually impossible to sell them on the
open market.
   However, Dutch Association of Museums spokesman R. Zijp said in a
Dutch TV interview that ``what's most likely is that they'll be held
to ransom, (in) a kind of kidnapping.''
   Van Seventer said no ransom demand had so far been made.
   In another TV interview, Culture Minister Elco Brinkman said
security at the country's national museums was being increased.
   But, ``You can't just go on pouring tens of millions of guilders
into it,'' Brinkman said. ``Some time you'll have to face the
question whether there aren't any better ways of spending that money
on culture.''
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum is named for Mrs. H.E.L.J.
Kroeller-Mueller, the art-loving wife of a prominent industrialist
who bequeathed it to the nation in 1938 with the surrounding park.
   The museum contains 278 van Gogh paintings, sketches and etchings.
   Kroeller-Mueller's ``The Potato Eaters'' is the second in a
series of three, with the final and most important painting on
display at Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh National Museum.
   The 1885 works were painted in van Gogh's native village of
Nuenen and are among his most poignant expressions of famine and
hardship. Done in dark, harsh tones, they show a peasant family
eating potatoes, their faces lined by suffering and deprivation.

<HEAD>USDA Sets Final Allocations for Export Promotion Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Final allocations totaling $90 million have
been made under the Targeted Export Assistance program in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Under TEA, as the program is called, various trade organizations
get funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural
products. The program's goal is to counter the adverse effects of
unfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own funds in carrying out a specific project, although the amounts
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department.
   The level of TEA spending was set by the 1985 farm law at $110
million annually through fiscal 1988 and at $325 million in each of
the following two years. However, the USDA's appropriation act for
1989 reduced the level to $200 million.
   An initial allocation of $110 million was announced on Aug. 17,
and the latest of $90 million completes the program funding for the
1989 fiscal year.
   The largest amount, $8.2 million, was reserved for applicants to
promote the overseas sales of almonds, followed by $8.1 million for
the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Other leading recipients include:
Cotton Council International, $7.1 million; American Plywood
Association, $5.9 million; and National Forest Products Association,
$4.85 million.

<HEAD>Government Settles Suit With Former FBI Agent Who Gambled Away
Agency Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former FBI agent who claimed his gambling
habit was a handicap, not a reason for dismissal, has settled a suit
he filed against the federal government after he was fired for
gambling away $1,800 in FBI funds, officials said Tuesday.
   The Justice Department has agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to
Anthony P. Rezza, 50, a 22-year veteran of the FBI, according to an
unidentified source cited by the Philadelphia Daily News.
   Rezza also will be entitled to a reduced pension as a result of
the settlement and to attorney's fees, the newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   Rezza had sued the Justice Department seeking back pay, his
pension and lawyers' fees.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joan K. Garner, who handled the
negotiations for the Justice Department, would not comment Tuesday
on the terms of the settlement or the reasons the government agreed
to settle.
   Rezza's attorney, Alice W. Ballard, did not immediately return a
phone call seeking comment Tuesday.
   Ms. Ballard had contended that Rezza was a pathological gambler
in July 1985 when he drove to Atlantic City without permission in an
FBI car and played blackjack with money that was to have been used
for an undercover drug buy.
   Agents found Rezza inside the Trump Plaza Casino. Rezza, now a
private investigator, underwent treatment for his gambling and said
in court documents that he has not gambled since. He also made
restitution of the FBI funds he lost.
   Ms. Ballard said pathological gambling is a handicap, which,
under federal law, obligates the FBI to help, not fire, an impaired
employee.
   U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig ruled last month that Rezza
was a pathological gambler when the gambling spree took place.
   Court records showed Rezza had lost as much as $40,000 of his and
his wife's money in the preceding five years through gambling.
   Rezza claimed in his suit that the FBI punished him more severely
than it did other agents who committed worse offenses. In response,
the government had to produce files of secret disciplinary actions
against other agents. FBI officials have declined comment on the
files.
   The cases included:
   _A supervisory agent in Philadelphia who placed bets with a
bookie through an intermediary while his squad was investigating the
same bookie. The agent was demoted, suspended for 45 days and placed
on probation.
   _An agent arrested while entering the United States with
marijuana and drug paraphernalia, suspended for 30 days.
   _An agent who falsified a report from a lie detector test in
1983, suspended for 21 days.
   _An agent who failed to report his arrest for drunken driving,
suspended for 40 days and put on probation.
   No names were included in the files presented in court, and they
were accompanied by little detail.

<HEAD>Fire Ants New Concern For Super Collider</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire ants, infamous for chewing through
underground cables and sparking shortages, have nibbled their way to
the attention of federal scientists evaluating the Texas farmland
designated as the site for the $4.4 billion super collider physics
project.
   The Department of Energy says additional studies may be needed to
evaluate the effect of the venomous fire ant, which has defied
scientists' attempts at eradication for decades, on the giant,
underground facility that researchers hope will give new insights on
the nature of matter.
   Warranting a special look, said the DOE in a 26-pound final
environmental impact statement, are the design of electrical
facilities and other underground components to prohibit fire ant
infestation; construction practices to protect workers from the
ant's painful sting; and an environmentally sound pesticide policy.
   The impact statement, totaling some 10,000 pages, said the Texas
site, near Waxahachie, is in an area infested with fire ants and
that local residents report it has caused numerous problems with the
operation of home and farm equipment.
   ``Fire ants appear to be attracted to electrical equipment and
can cause shorts by chewing through insulation and by crowding into
spaces around electrical contacts,'' the statement said.
   The study noted unsuccessful efforts by utility companies and
highway departments to deal with the ants and the outages they cause.
   A Texas Department of Agriculture representative told the Energy
Department that management programs were only 80 percent effective.
Others who commented said 30 years of study by federal and state
agriculture officials still has not yielded an effective method of
eradicating the ant, only control procedures.
   Fire ants can also pose a potential health risk since their bite
is painful and can sometimes lead to other, more serious reactions
in humans, the study said.
   For most people, a sting results in a postule, accompanied by
pain and itching that lasts a week, the study said. For others,
medical attention may be needed, especially for a few victims so
sensitive to the ants' venom they go into anaphylactic shock.

   Rep. Bill Nichols, a staunch Pentagon supporter
who became a leader in efforts to reform the nation's military
establishment, died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack at his
office, an aide to the Alabama Democrat said. He was 70.
   Nichols, who won his 12th term in Congress last month, died in
the emergency room at Capitol Hill Hospital shortly after 8 a.m.,
hospital spokeswoman Lisa Poulter said.
   He was rushed to the hospital after an aide heard a noise in his
office and found him unconscious, lying face down behind his desk,
said Tom McMahan, a Nichols spokesman.
   Nichols, who lost a leg in World War II, was a strong supporter
of President Reagan's military buildup, but he used his chairmanship
of the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee to keep a
close watch over Pentagon spending.
   After widely publicized hearings into such questionable
expendutures as $400 Navy hammers and $5,000 Air Force coffee pots,
Nichols succeeded in amending a military spending bill to require
the Defense Department to report to Congress on procurement reforms
and to prohibit defense contractors from billing the government for
expenses such as country club dues and lobbying costs.
   The courtly, white-haired legislator also headed the
congressional investigation into the 1983 bombing of the Marine
barracks in Lebanon which killed 241 Americans. That investigation
uncovered problems in the military chain of command which prompted
Nichols to push for a reorganization of the joints chiefs of staff.
   Three years later, Congress enacted legislation co-authored by
Nichols and then-Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., that provided for
the most far-reaching overhaul of the upper levels of the military
services in four decades.
   The legislation, known as the Goldwater-Nichols Defense
Reorganization Act, strengthened the authority of the chairman of
the joint chiefs and the heads of the nation's joint commands while
reducing the power of the individual uniformed service chiefs. It
also made hundreds of changes in military procedures.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., who served with Nichols for nearly 30
years in the Alabama Legislature and the Congress, said Nichols
``took a lot of heat on that legislation from the Pentagon.
   ``But he held the line,'' Bevill said in a statement, ``and in my
judgment, this legislation will prove to be one of the most
important changes made in the armed services in this century.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said in a statement that
Nichols ``was a true friend of the military and a respected member
of the House Armed Services Committee for many years. We will miss
his support, his leadership and his friendship.''
   An aide to Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, a Republican, said the governor
is required under state law to call a special election to replace
Nichols in the 3rd District congressional seat.
   Nichols was born on a farm near Becker, Miss., but grew up in
Sylacauga, Ala. He earned an undergraduate degree in agriculture
from Auburn University in 1939 and a master's degree in 1941. He was
captain of the school's football team.
   During World War II, Nichols was injured in a land mine explosion
while fighting with the Army in Europe in 1944. He underwent 19
operations and eventually lost his left leg from the knee down. He
was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
   Nichols returned to Sylacauga after the war and served as
president of Parker Fertilizer Co. and Parker Gin Co. He was elected
to the Alabama House, where he served until his election to the
Alabama Senate in 1963. He was elected to Congress in 1966.
   He is survived by his wife, the former Carolyn Funderburk; two
daughters, Margaret Vlachou of Athens, Greece, and Memorie Mitchell
of Birmingham, Ala.; a son, Flynt Nichols of Dallas; and three
grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be held Thursday afternoon at the First
United Methodist Church in Sylacauga. The Rev. J. Charles Boling,
Nichols' minister and lifelong friend, will officiate.

<TEXT>
   Videocassettes of a woman's extramarital affair
were sent to her neighbors, business associates and parents until
sympathetic friends staked out a PTA meeting and identified her
jilted lover as the culprit.
   Eric Sanderson, 45, has pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges
of littering, telephone harassment and reckless driving for
allegedly trying to run the woman and her husband off the road. A
trial is scheduled in East Detroit Municipal Court on Jan. 11, court
clerk Bernadine Senske said.
   East Detroit City Attorney Robert Ihrie said Tuesday the woman
broke off her affair with Sanderson in May, and in June received the
first videocassette of herself and Sanderson engaging in sex. Ihrie
said the woman was unaware the videotape had been made.
   Soon after, she and her husband came out of a restaurant and
found the videocassettes taped to the windshields of all the cars in
the parking lot.
   The couple also found obscene cartoons identifying the woman
throughout their neighborhood, and the couple received harassing
calls at their business, sometimes as many as 275 in a day, Ihrie
said.
   Ihrie said the tapes started appearing on the windshields of cars
at meetings the woman attended, at their neighbors' homes, their
business associates' offices and even at the home of the woman's
parents 350 miles away.
   East Detroit Police Lt. Lewis Hunt said about 50 tapes had been
confiscated as evidence.
   ``In my opinion, short of physical violence, this is the most
outrageous human conduct I have seen,'' Ihrie said. ``They are a
hurt couple. They are trying to restore themselves. ... It's been a
nightmarish experience.''
   East Detroit Municipal Judge Benedict Segesta in July ordered
Sanderson to stay away from the couple and released him on $2,000
personal bond.
   But the couple told police the videotapes, cartoons and calls
continued through the summer. Ihrie said he tried to have
Sanderson's bond revoked, but Segesta instead increased it to $5,000
on Oct. 27.
   Eventually, the woman enlisted a group of friends and asked them
to stake out a PTA meeting she was attending. Her friends saw a man
begin taping videotapes to the windshields of cars outside the
meeting place, police said.
   The man later was identified from photos as Sanderson, Ihrie said.
   On Dec. 1, Segesta revoked Sanderson's bond and sentenced him to
30 days in jail for violating his bond.

<HEAD>Driver Left Engine Moments Before Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One driver involved in the fatal triple-train crash
in south London left his engine moments before the accident to call
signal operators from the side of the tracks, British Rail said
Tuesday.
   Scotland Yard revised the death toll to 33, down from 36, saying
the discrepancy was caused by the mutilated and dismembered state of
some of the bodies. The victims included nine women and 24 men, all
but two of whom died at the scene.
   The state-run railroad has said Monday's crash, which injured 113
people, 32 seriously, probably was caused by a signal-related fault
during modernization of 40-year-old equipment.
   Neither British Rail nor driver Alex McClymont would comment on
news stories that he was reporting the signal lights were flickering
between red, green and yellow and confusing drivers.
   ML Engineering of Plymouth, the company responsible for designing
and supplying the new signaling equipment, said ``the difficulty
appears to be in the wiring to that equipment'' which was British
Rail's responsibility.
   Gordon Pettitt, general manager of British Rail's southern
region, said McClymont acted properly in stopping his train to call
signal operators because his train was not equipped with a two-way
radio.
   ``Therefore, the driver, quite correctly being concerned at what
he had seen, we believe, got down and talked to the signalman at the
earliest possible stage,'' Pettitt said. ``He acted absolutely
correctly.''
   Asked in an TV interview whether the accident could have been
averted if the driver had a radio, Pettitt said: ``I think it's
likely that it may have avoided it and it certainly may have avoided
such serious results.''
   As workers removed the last of the mangled metal and retrieved
personal belongings of the estimated 1,500 people, the Duchess of
York and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited the injured, and
Pope John Paul II sent his condolences.
   The stretch of track that had been closed since the disaster
reopened Tuesday night.
   McClymont's train was idling outside the Clapham Junction rail
station, one of Europe's busiest, when a fast-moving passenger train
slammed into it during the morning rush hour, entombing some
passengers in the twisted metal and hurling out others.
   An empty freight train traveling in the opposite direction on the
adjoining track struck the spillover wreckage as well as some
passengers trying to scramble to safety. A fourth train, crowded
with commuters, stopped a few feet short of the wreck, British Rail
said.
   A British Rail spokesman who requested anonymity said McClymont
was still in a state of shock and, like all railroad employees
involved in Monday's accident, did not work Tuesday.
   ``We hope to get his account if he is fit enough to talk to us,''
when the railroad's internal investigation begins Wednesday, the
spokesman said. The driver of the other passenger train, John Rolls,
was killed, he said.
   Transportation Secretary Paul Channon said the lack of radios on
some British Rail trains would be one subject of an independent
inquiry he has ordered into Britain's worst rail accident since 1975.
   McClymont said Monday night he was ``standing at the side of the
track, talking to the signalers on the telephone,'' when he heard a
train approaching.
   ``Then, a split second later, there was a hell of a bang and
everything shot forward,'' he said. ``It was a terrible sight.''
   Pettitt said plans to equip trains with radios might be speeded
up. All new trains are being fitted with radios, but they are being
installed gradually in older trains like the ones involved in the
crash, he said.
   British Rail said it will issue checks for about $3,600 as soon
as possible to families who need financial help for funerals or to
visit hospitalized relatives.

   A candle at an altar to Mexico's patron
saint started a pre-dawn fire Tuesday that engulfed a dormitory at a
state prison, killing 20 inmates and injuring six, authorities said.
   Raul Garza, state communications director, said 19 prisoners died
of smoke inhalation or burns at the prison and another died a few
hours later at University Hospital in Monterrey, the capital of
northern Nuevo Leon state.
   The fire broke out at the state penitentiary when a candle at a
small altar to the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of this
Roman Catholic country, ignited a curtain.
   ``Yesterday was a religious holiday to the Virgin of Guadalupe,
so there were an inordinate amount of altars and candles in the
dormitory,'' said Garza in a telephone interview from Monterrey.
   He said the flames spread to curtains hanging from four-level
bunk beds in a ward housing 116 prisoners.
   ``The mattresses also caught fire, and there was a lot of
smoke,'' Garza said. ``The mattresses were made of a material that
doesn't burn easily, but unfortunately it creates a lot of toxic
smoke.
   ``It was an accident that cannot be attributed to anybody,'' he
said.
   Three prisoners were in University Hospital's intensive care unit
Tuesday, and three others were being treated in the prison hospital,
Garza said.
   The Excelsior news agency quoted an unidentified woman as saying
she was on a conjugal visit with her husband when the fire broke
out. It quoted her as saying the prisoners beat on the doors, but
nobody would let them out.
   Garza denied the report. ``All the prisoners were evacuated
within 10 minutes and moved to other wards,'' he said. The entire
prison houses about 1,800 prisoners.
   The spokesman said the fire was brought under control about half
an hour later and state authorities were investigating.

   Authorities on Tuesday revised to 68 the
official death toll in an explosion and fire that ripped through a
crowded downtown market on Sunday.
   ``There was a lot of initial confusion and a lot of people
killed,'' said Jose Agustin Moreno, the spokesman for the district
attorney's office in Mexico City.
   Moreno said investigators were still trying to determine what set
off tons of illegal fireworks sold by vendors at the market.
   The mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Camacho Solis, announced a
citywide ban on fireworks Monday. Before the explosion, a special
permit was required to sell or use fireworks, but few vendors had
permits.
   The reported death toll has fluctuated since the explosion from
as high as 70 and as low as 62.

   King Birendra of Nepal on Tuesday granted
permission to his younger brother, His Royal Highness Prince
Dhirendra, to renounce the title and its privileges, the royal
palace said.
   Dhirendra, 40, had submitted a petition to the king on Dec. 8
``seeking permission of his own free will to renounce the title,''
the palace said.
   The palace gave no reason for Dhirendra's move, which was the

   Dhirenra was fifth in line of succession to the throne.

   The California Raisins donned red noses and NBC
weatherman Willard Scott played Santa on Tuesday as they helped
Nancy Reagan hold her final White House Christmas party for the
children of the diplomatic corps.
   ``We'll be thinking of you ... we'll both be thinking of you, and
this party, next year,'' Mrs. Reagan told the gathering in the East
Room. ``Best wishes for a Merry Christmas for all the years to
come.''
   The first lady, clad in a signature red dress, sat among the
squirming and giggling crowd of some 370 children, and watched as
dancers, dressed as the giant purple raisins, cavorted to and fro to
the tunes of various Christmas carols set to Motown rhythm.
   Scott, who acted as master of ceremonies, then joined Mrs. Reagan
and the children in the State Dining Room for a round of cookies and
punch.
   The annual party, organized by The Hospitality and Information
Service, has been a White House tradition since 1962, when it was
first hosted by Jacqueline Kennedy.
   The children are invited to attend by the service, which helps
diplomatic families adjust to Washington. This year, the children
ranged in age from 6 to 10 and came from some 73 countries,
according to Jane Taube, a volunteer organizer for THIS.

   Police briefly detained 20 U.S. and European Jews
who were protesting in front of the U.N. building during PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat's speech Tuesday, police said.
   ``They attempted to walk in a silent prayer vigil, wearing prayer
shawls,'' said Howard Jonas, a member of the group. He said police
arrested members of the group without warning and took them away in
vans.
   Jonas said he was not detained because he was walking slightly
behind the group.
   He identified the arrested Americans as Rabbi Avraham Weiss;
David Mann, president of the Board of Jewish Education; Hillel
Jaffee; Bernard Glickman and Glenn Richter, all of New York.
   The 15 Europeans were college students from Switzerland, France
and Italy, he said.
   The 20 were released after several hours, according to a police
officer who refused to identify himself. He said they were detained
for interfering with traffic.
   The Swiss implemented strict security measures for Arafat's
visit, including a ban on demonstrations near the U.N. building.

<HEAD>`Night Court' Tops Rankings in Thursday Reappearance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A repeat of ``Night Court'' visiting its old time
period was the highest-rated prime-time show in the Nielsen ratings
last week as NBC's Thursday comedies held a reunion at the top of
the rankings.
   Some of the shine appeared to be off ABC's ``Moonlighting.'' Its
season premiere ranked 13th, compared to last season's premiere at
fifth. ``thirtysomething'' followed in its season premiere and
ranked 29th.
   NBC's entire Thursday night lineup made the top 10. ``Night
Court,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Cheers'' and ``A Different World''
ranked 1, 2, 3, 4. ``L.A. Law'' was ninth.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,''
ABC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``L.A. Law,''
NBC; and ``Empty Nest,'' NBC.
   NBC has moved ``Night Court'' to Wednesday. ``Dear John,'' a new
show, went into the ``Night Court'' slot on Thursday, but has
frequently failed to make the top 10.
   NBC's network premiere of the theatrical film ``Spies Like Us''
landed in 17th place, besting ``Roots: The Gift'' on ABC on Sunday.
``Roots'' ranked 25th.
   NBC won the week ending Dec. 11, its 25th in a row, with an
average, prime-time rating of 15.1. ABC had a 13.2, and CBS 10.7.
   CBS tried to get a bigger sampling for its new comedy ``Murphy
Brown,'' running it with the season premiere of ``Kate & Allie'' on
Sunday night. The special ``Murphy'' ranked 32nd, only slightly
higher than the regularly scheduled episode on Monday at 37th.
   The news race was a virtual tie with less than half a rating
point separating the three broadcasts. The ``CBS Evening News''
edged the others with an 11.2 rating and 20 share. ``ABC World News
Tonight'' had a 10.9 and 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.8
and 20 share.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ABC's
analysis of President Reagan's news conference, ``Simon & Simon,''
``Murphy's Law,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``TV101,''
``Knightwatch,'' ``Raising Miranda,'' ``The Van Dyke Show'' and
``Annie McGuire.''
   CBS announced Tuesday it was canceling ``Van Dyke'' and ``Raising
Miranda'' and putting ``Dirty Dancing'' on hiatus. Mary Tyler
Moore's ``Annie McGuire'' and ``Simon & Simon'' were also canceled,
but with a possibility of returning in the future. CBS also said it
would move ``TV101'' from Tuesday night to Wednesday night.
   ABC had previously announced it was canceling ``Knightwatch.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday
rejected PLO chief Yasser Arafat's call for peace talks and said
Israel would never accept the PLO as a partner for negotiations.
   Calling the PLO's new image of moderation ``a mirage,'' Shamir
urged the United States not to be duped into thinking the
organization had changed its ways.
   ``We know what hides behind his (Arafat's) words,'' Shamir told a
news conference. ``We know that as they are spoken acts of terror
continue.''
   Arafat's appeal to the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva won praise
from prominent Israeli doves, including the liberal Citizens Rights
Movement, but it failed to sway the center.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's political rival from the
center-left Labor Party, remained silent in apparent agreement with
Shamir. He was expected to react in a parliament speech Wednesday.
   Shamir was uncompromising in his rejection of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Arafat's peace feelers.
   ``We shall not negotiate with the PLO under any conditions nor
recognize it,'' the prime minister said. ``From our point of view,
the PLO is no partner for any peace process.''
   Before Arafat's speech, Israel's state-run radios raised
expectations the U.S. government was poised to recognize the PLO.
They said U.S. officials had received an advance text of Arafat's
speech and had coordinated changes in wording with the PLO.
   In Washington, the State Department relieved some of Israel's
concern by announcing that Arafat's speech fell short of meeting
U.S. conditions for opening a dialogue with the PLO.
   Those conditions are explicit recognition of Israel's right to
exist, unequivocal acceptance of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 as a
basis for negotiations and renunciation of terrorism.
   The U.N. resolutions accord all nations in the region the right
to exist within secure borders and call for the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from territory occupied in 1967.
   About the time Arafat addressed the United Nations, Israeli
officials announced that a Palestinian in the West Bank had shot and
killed two Israelis after seizing a gun from a Jewish settler. The
Palestinian was then killed by Israeli soldiers.
   Referring to the incident, Shamir said, ``what happened is
another illustration of a decision by the hostile circles in the PLO
to continue their violence.''
   Although Arafat condemned terror ``in all its forms,'' Israeli
officials noted he continued to praise the ``struggle for
liberation,'' a reference to the Palestinan uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip in which 13 Israelis have died.
   They also noted the PLO had not clearly recognized Israel's right
to exist.
   The Citizens Rights movement, which was aligned with the Labor
Party in the recent parliament elections, called on both the U.S.
and Israeli governments to start talks with the PLO.
   ``The Israeli government must now put the PLO to the test and
propose peace negotiations,'' it said, calling on U.S. leaders to
exert pressure by meeting with Arafat.
   Similar views were expressed by doves in the Labor Party itself.
   ``One has to be blind not to see that the moderate stream is
becoming the dominant one in the PLO,'' Labor parliament member Lova
Eliav said on Israel television.
   Amiram Goldblum of the Peace Now movement said in an interview
that the PLO's new moderation was having an impact. He said 30 to 35
members of Israel's 120-seat parliament now supported a favorable
response to Arafat's peace initiative.
   Palestinian moderates here welcomed Arafat's speech.
   Daoud Kuttab, a journalist who listened to the speech with
several dozen other Palestinian intellectuals at a theater in Arab
east Jerusalem, said Israel had ``no more excuses'' for avoiding
talks with the PLO.
   He defended Arafat's refusal to extend explicit recognition of
Israel, saying this would mean recognizing Israel with specific
borders.
   ``Spelling out such specific boundaries could be detrimental to
negotiations,'' Kuttab said.

   Earthquake survivors shivered in freezing weather
with little shelter Tuesday, and foreign medical experts said rescue
efforts should focus on the living because it is too late to save
people still trapped.
   Six days after the earthquake razed northern Armenia, the
official death toll climbed to 55,000 and the number of injured
reached 13,000, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
told a news briefing.
   ``One of our most urgent tasks is to rescue those people who are
alive,'' Gerasimov said. About 5,400 people have been pulled from
wrecked buildings since the earthquake, and the number still trapped
is not known.
   But two foreign doctors involved in the relief effort said
resources must be devoted to saving those who are known to have
survived.
   Dr. Bernard Mankikian visited the region around Spitak as part of
a relief team from the French branch of Medecins du Monde (Doctors
without Borders), which returned to Paris on Tuesday.
   Spitak, small town near the epicenter of Wednesday's quake, was
almost totally destroyed.
   ``They (survivors) are almost totally isolated in the cold,'' he
said. ``People are staying close to their homes, without shelter or
access to aid that is available in the bigger towns. They cannot
stay like this and survive,'' he said.
   Relief workers with blankets, warm clothes and tents have yet to
reach survivors in small isolated villages around the mountainous
countryside near Spitak.
   Soviet television Tuesday showed rows of tents set up near the
ruins of the city of Stepanovan to the northeast. The commentator
said, ``There are not enough tents.''
   A commission headed by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov has ordered
Soviet relief workers to ensure that warm clothes, blankets, and
tents reach rural areas, the official news agency Tass reported
Tuesday.
   ``It was pointed out that the state agroindustrial committees of
Armenia and the Soviet Union had displayed perplexity and lack of
organization at first,'' Tass said Tuesday. ``The situation began to
change after resolute measures were taken yesterday.''
   The Soviet Meteorological Center in Moscow forecast continued
freezing weather for the next several days. Trucks struggled to
cross snowy mountain passes to bring in tents flown in by relief
planes to outlying areas.
   The Communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said 60,000
tents have been sent to the disaster area, but many people still
were shivering around bonfires scattered among the ruins.
   ``The collapsed villages are suffering especially from the
disaster,'' the newspaper said, quoting helicopter Capt. Sergei
Bobylev. In one village 20 children died in the quake and ``now
survivors are dying from cold,'' the newspaper said.
   Survivors also have other tasks on their minds besides their own
shelter and safety. They are busy burying their relatives or
searching for loved ones still buried under the rubble.
   In the village of Nalbanb, with a pre-quake population of 4,200,
residents have already buried 2,800 of the dead, Associated Press
photographer Morton Hvaal reported after visiting the village on
Tuesday.
   Dr. Robert Gale, a bone marrow specialist who assisted the
Soviets following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in April 1986, said
the medical effort must now focus on saving those who survived
because it is too late to help those still buried.
   ``We now consider the search and rescue phase as being over
because there is very little hope of finding anyone alive,'' said
Gale, who arrived in Yerevan on Sunday and went straight to Spitak.
   ``In the long run, we'll save more lives in Yerevan by
reinforcing the hospitals there,'' Gale said.
   But one of Mankikian's colleagues, Patrick Aeberhard, said in
Paris that the cold actually could help trapped victims by slowing
their metabolism and allowing them to live longer.
   Citing the experience of other earthquake disasters such as
Mexico City, where people lived for up to two weeks buried in
rubble, Ryzhkov pledged on Monday to keep looking for survivors as
long as it was possible to find anyone.
   In his first public comment since he left the quake area, Health
Minister Yevgeny Chazov described the conditions faced by some of
the 220 medical teams in Armenia.
   The first complex operations, including amputations, were carried
out in the streets under the open air, Tass quoted Chazov as saying.
   ``When we arrived in the quake-stricken area, there was neither
electric light nor communications there. Fires were raging. The
quake destroyed all hospitals. Seventy per cent of the medical
personnel was killed,'' Chazov said.
   Many survivors suffer from compression syndrome. When the body is
crushed, blood cannot flow to the injured parts of the body, toxic
elements accumulate and gangrene sets in, Dr. Alexander Konavalov,
Director of the Institute of Neurosugery, told the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper.
   Gerasimov said at least 17 of the dialysis machines essential to
fight compression syndrome have arrived, but more are needed.
   Soviet officials have begun considering the massive
reconstruction effort needed in areas flattened by the quake.
Ryzhkov said the estimated cost of rebuilding will be at least 5
billion rubles ($8 billion).
   Ryzhkov is heading a commission that will investigate the design
of the buildings which crumbled during the quake.
   At a news conference Monday, Ryzhkov said many people died
unnecesarily in the quake due to ``gross violations'' in planning
and building apartment buildings that collapsed on their occupants.

   A lawyer for confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi on Tuesday asked the court to summon
Syria's president to testify at the trial.
   President Hafez Assad could shed light on the June 1985 hijacking
of the TWA Athens-to-Rome flight that was diverted to Beirut, where
hostages were released and sent to Damascus, the Syrian capital,
said Gabriele Steck-Bromme.
   Mrs. Steck-Bromme also asked the court to summon Nabih Berri,
Lebanon's Justice Minister and leader of the Shiite Amal militia,
who helped negotiate the release of passengers.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger made no immediate ruling on Mrs.
Steck-Bromme's motion.
   During the 17-day ordeal, 39 Americans were held hostage and U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot and killed. Hamadi, a Lebanese
Shiite Moslem who is charged with air piracy and murder, admits he
was one of the hijackers, but denies he shot Stethem.
   Mrs. Steck-Bromme also said U.S. authorities reneged on their
promise not to prosecute the hijackers if the hostages were released
from the seized plane. She said the U.S. officials made the pledge
before the American hostages were handed over to Red Cross officials
and sent to Damascus. The U.S. government has denied that any deals
were made.
   After Mrs. Steck-Bromme's motion, a journalist called by the
court to testify as a Middle East expert said American authorities
made such a promise but did not keep it.
   West Germany last year rejected a U.S. request for Hamadi's
extradition, but much of the prosecution's case against Hamadi is
based on evidence collected by U.S. authorities and on testimony
from American witnesses.
   Adel Elias, 50, a Middle East correspondent for the West German
news magazine Der Spiegel, testified that Berri had told him about
U.S. promises tied to the release of the Americans.
   Elias, a Lebanese-born journalist who is now a West German
citizen, also described the difficult conditions in which poor
Shiite families live in west Beirut, where Hamadi was raised.
   Mrs. Steck-Bromme maintains Berri could testify about the aim of
the hijackers, who had demanded the release of more than 700 Arab
prisoners held in Israel. Shortly after the end of the hijacking,
Israel freed some of the prisoners but said their release was not
linked to the air piracy.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   Two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts reminisced
Tuesday about their mission around the moon 20 years ago this month
_ a feat they said helped lift the nation out of despair at a trying
time in its history.
   ``You have to remember the time span of when Apollo 8 went up,
which was the end of 1968 ... not a very stellar year here in this
country,'' James Lovell, who served as command module pilot,
recalled at the Museum of Science and Industry. The spacecraft's
command module is on loan there from the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington.
   ``Bobby Kennedy was assasinated, Martin Luther King ... the
Vietnam war was going on, the Democrtaic convention in Chicago ...
we had all sorts of riots _ and it was sort of a down year,'' Lovell
added.
   ``It was some sort of project or an achievement that everybody
could look up to ... it was a goal that you could go outside and see
the moon and know that the United States had finally put a
spacecraft around the moon ...
   ``It couldn't have happened at a better time,'' he said.
   Joining Lovell at the museum was Frank Borman, the Apollo 8
commander. The third astronaut on the mission was William Anders.
   Apollo 8 is perhaps best remembered for footage broadcast
internationally of the three astronauts reading passages from the
biblical book of Genesis on Christmas Eve 1968, with a stunning view
of the Earth from 250,000 miles away.
   ``Up to that point it was the largest audience that had ever
listened to a human voice,'' Lovell recalled
   The mission, launched Dec. 21, 1968, hurled the three astronauts
25,000 miles an hour, a speed no human had endured. During the
six-day space flight _ then the longest on record _ the men circled
the moon 10 times, photographing potential sites for future Apollo
landings there.
   The Apollo 11 mission _ the first to put a man on the moon _
landed six months later, on July 20, 1969.
   Borman recalled the Apollo program as generating ``almost a
nationalistic fervor'' that faded as space flights became blase.
   Borman, 60, left the space program in 1970 and took the helm at
Eastern Airlines, where he served as chairman for 11 years until his
resignation in 1986. He currently serves as vice chairman at Texas
Air.
   Lovell, also 60, resigned from the space program in 1973 and
currently serves as executive vice president at Centel Business
Systems in Chicago.
   ``Apollo 8, I think, will always be the single most highlight of
my professional life,'' Borman said.

<HEAD>Congress Expecting Two-Dozen Military Bases To Get Ax</HEAD>

   Congress is expecting a Pentagon commission to
recommend that about 24 military bases be closed, according to House
and Senate aides who were briefed Tuesday on what to do if a base in
their area gets the ax.
   Fifty anxious congressional staff members from Northeast and
Midwest states met for two hours to be briefed by Reagan
administration officials and to swap rumors about which bases might
be declared obsolete.
   The aides were told by officials of the Northeast-Midwest Senate
Coalition and its counterpart group in the House that they likely
will receive the list of recommended base closings on Dec. 30 _ the
Friday kicking off New Year's weekend.
   While the briefing was closed to reporters, participants said the
``working figure'' for the expected number of bases on the list was
24. That estimate was provided at the briefing by Robert Bayer of
the Senate Armed Services Committee staff.
   The Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and
Closure has kept quiet about its deliberations, refusing even a
request by 17 senators to learn whether it would take geographic
considerations into account.
   The commission was created from legislation designed to save the
government up to $5 billion per year by shutting down bases deemed
no longer useful.
   Northeast and Midwest lawmakers have urged the commission to
consider ``regional inequities'' as it draws up its list of unneeded
bases. At the briefing, the Northeast-Midwest Congressional
Coalition distributed charts and tables showing Northeast and
Midwest states getting less than their fair share of defense dollars.
   ``We wish to prevent the further entrenchment of regional
inequities stemming from the location of existing military
facilities,'' said an Oct. 25 letter to the commission from Sens.
John Heinz, R-Pa., Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and 15 other
senators.
   But all the the commission would say in reply was that it has
developed five factors to consider each base's value to the
military, and that environmental and economic factors also would be
weighed.
   House and Senate staffs have focused their attention on large
bases. The Congressional Research Service recently obtained from the
Defense Department a list of all bases employing 100 people or more
to help members prepare for Dec. 30.
   But Bayer said Tuesday the commission also may opt to sell off
some bases' high-value properties while leaving the facility's
overall mission intact _ a move that would come under the heading of
base ``realignment.''
   John Lynch, associate director of the Defense Department's Office
of Economic Adjustment, said communities that lose bases might be
advised to quickly mobilize private sector and government support
rather than trying to contest the decision.
   ``Often, the wrong course may be to fight,'' Lynch said. He said
government grants are available to help communities adjust to losing
a base.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci will have until Jan. 15 to
accept or reject the commission's list.

<HEAD>82-Year-Old Woman Survives 2{ Hours In Icy Creek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARDON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 82-year-old, legally blind woman who said
she spent 2{ hours in an icy creek after falling down a cliff while
feeding birds in 10-degree weather was hospitalized in fair
condition Tuesday.
   Jesse Norton was wearing several layers of clothing, boots and
gloves which helped her survive, Geauga Hospital spokeswoman Sharon
Kilpatrick said.
   Ms. Kilpatrick said Ms. Norton's body temperature was 81.9
degrees when she was admitted to the hospital Monday after being
pulled to safety by a rescue crew.
   Warm intravenous fluids restored Ms. Norton's body temperature
and she was cognizant Tuesday afternoon but in a special care unit
and unble to talk on the telephone, Ms. Kilpatrick said.
   Ms. Norton, of Chardon, apparently was feeding birds when she
fell down a 25-foot cliff into a creek that feeds into the Chagrin
River, said Laura Johnson of Chardon, a home health aide who checks
on Ms. Norton weekly.
   Ms. Johnson said Ms. Norton was legally blind and told her she
had been in the water 2{ hours.
   ``Jesse's a pretty strong woman,'' said Ms. Johnson, 25, who is
employed by the Visiting Nurse Service of Chardon.
   When she went to Ms. Norton's house and realized the woman had
tumbled down the cliff, Ms. Johnson called her supervisor, Laurie
Bender.
   ``Knowing this woman personally, it doesn't surprise me (she
survived),'' Ms. Bender said. ``She is very active.''
   Ms. Johnson said after calling Ms. Bender she grabbed a robe, rug
and blanket to wrap up the woman, and slid back down the hill. She
said she pulled Ms. Norton from the water and waited with her for
help.
   ``We just cuddled up and kept warm,'' said Ms. Johnson, adding
Ms. Norton was in and out of consciousness. She recalled telling Ms.
Norton, ``She was going to be all right and think positive and help
would be here soon. Actually, I was trying to keep her calm.''
   Ms. Johnson began rubbing the woman's body to warm her.
   Ms. Johnson said her family's involvement in emergency services
work helped prepare her. ``All my relatives belong to a fire
department and this is in my blood. (With such experience) you don't
show fear,'' she said.

   President-elect Bush's designated Cabinet
officers are supervising teams of people mapping out strategy for
the new administration, aides said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein was
given the names of transition aides who will be contacting various
government agencies to collect information about their operations.
   The information-gathering and review process at the transition
office will be broken into two parts, transition officials said in a
statement.
   The first phase involves a group of people known as Transition
Office Contacts, or TOCs, who are responsible for departments or
agencies. For example, six people directed by James A. Baker III,
the designated secretary of state, are the contacts for the State
Department.
   The TOCs ``gather and analyze the information provided by the
particular department (in books and briefings) and then prepare the
material to be used in the second phase of the transition process by
the Cabinet officer-designate,'' the statement said.
   The second phase, headed by designated Cabinet officers such as
Baker and Robert Mosbacher, the appointed commerce secretary, are to
continue the information-gathering but also ``facilitate hands-on
administration of the department after the inauguration and Senate
confirmation.''
   The transition has notified the White House and the General
Services Administration, the government's housekeeping agency, of
the process.
   The GSA is handling logistics for the transition, which is
operating on a budget of about $3.5 million.

   U.S. immigration commissioner Alan Nelson on
Tuesday said his agency's proposals to conduct swift reviews of
asylum applications from thousands of Nicaraguans are necessary to
clear up a huge backlog and stem abuses.
   The proposals, if implemented in their entirety, could result in
denials of work permits to many asylum-seekers, detention and
eventual deportation.
   ``The game plan is to devote additional resources to deal with
the asylum backlog'' involving Nicaraguans and other Central
Americans, Nelson, chief of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said in an interview.
   In Harlingen, Texas, nearly 12,000 Nicaraguans crossing the
border illegally have filed applications since June seeking asylum
in the United States, claiming they have been persecuted in their
home country.
   Under a July 1987 directive signed by then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, once Nicaraguans file asylum applications it is virtually
automatic that they are granted work permits in the United States
while their applications are pending.
   Meese's order, hailed by Nicaraguans in the United States, had
the effect of liberalizing political asylum policy for Nicaraguans
who feared persecution if they returned to their homeland.
   A clarification of the Meese order was sent this month to INS
field offices saying the Meese memorandum doesn't require automatic
granting of work authorization to Nicaraguan asylum applicants whose
claims are deemed frivolous.
   Nelson said that in Harlingen, salesmen are offering phony
packets of asylum documents to Nicaraguans and other Central
Americans seeking refuge in the United States.
   ``We have to have an orderly immigration system,'' Nelson said.
``We want those with legitimate claims to immigrate and get them
approved, but we must avoid abuses, and we're seeing evidence of
that in south Texas.''
   INS has devoted few resources to reviewing the Nicaraguans'
asylum applications, but with a current nationwide backlog of 22,000
applicants and increases continuing, INS' approach is about to
change.
   Nelson said half a dozen INS employees were being sent to Texas
to deal with the backlog of asylum applications and that some INS
workers in Los Angeles were being diverted to handle the backlog
there.
   ``After the first of the year, we'll likely add more to these
three areas to cut the backlog,'' Nelson said.
   The most recent asylum applications will be reviewed first and
``we'll work our way back to the older applications,'' on a last-in,
first-out basis, Nelson said. The speeded-up asylum reviews also
would apply to other Central Americans seeking refuge in the United
States.
   Canceling work permits issued to Nicaraguans or not issuing work
permits to new asylum applicants won't stop the influx of
Nicaraguans coming into the United States, said Roberto Arguello,
chairman of the public relations committee of the Nicaraguan
American Bankers Association in Miami.
   ``Nicaraguans would rather work under the worst kind of
conditions imaginable than to face the harsh realities that the
Sandinista government has imposed over them,'' Arguello said.
   Arguello said he anticipates that by the summer over 1,000
Nicaraguans a week will be coming to Miami, with the current level
at more than 400 a week, including people ``from all walks of life.
We have some Nicaraguans coming to Miami who cannot even read
Spanish.''
   The INS steps are ``not going to stop people from coming,''
predicted Maritza Herrera, executive director of the Nicaraguan
American Foundation in Miami. ``They come here and they're going to
stay in the underground economy, underpaid.''
   Internal INS documents obtained by The Associated Press show the
agency is contemplating a series of proposals which, if implemented,
could result in many Nicaraguans being detained promptly and
ultimately deported once their asylum claims are rejected.
   Nelson is to meet this week with Associate Attorney General
Francis Keating to go over various proposals, which the INS
commissioner said have already been discussed with the State
Department. Nelson refused to say specfically whether the proposals
had been discussed with the White House, but he added that ``these
things don't happen in a vacuum.''
   Nelson said the internal documents were draft proposals that were
still in the discussion stage. They include:
   _Having the majority of asylum applicants in Harlingen remain
there while INS makes a determination whether their applications are
frivolous.
   _Applicants denied asylum would immediately be served with court
orders and enter the deportation process.
   _Ensuring ``the effective utilization of all possible detention
capacity'' without adversely affecting the INS's criminal alien
program or detention of Mariel Cuban detainees. INS detention
facilities currently are crowded, and INS spokesman Duke Austin
downplayed the idea that substantial numbers of Nicaraguans would be
placed in detention facilities while awaiting final disposition of
deportation proceedings.
   _Instituting a fee system for asylum requests and work
authorization requests and use the funds to help clear up the asylum
case backlog.

   Three subway buffs completed their version of
what they called the longest subway ride in American history
Tuesday, a 29-hour, 47-minute marathon through each of the city's
466 stations.
   ``We're here, grubby but triumphant,'' said Richard Temple,
expedition leader. ``And all on one token. We never left the
system!''
   For $1, the three young men got a chance to view the sunrise over
Queens, taste pastry under Columbus Circle and enter a squalid
ladies' room in Coney Island.
   Seizing an opportunity afforded by the opening of three new
subway stations _ the first in 20 years _ the trio claimed to be the
first people to ride through every station of the enlarged system.
   Why did they do it?
   ``Because it's there,'' Temple said. ``It's something I've always
wanted to do, being something of a subway junkie.''
   Because of subway delays, the three friends _ Temple, 28, Phil
Vanner, 25, and Tom Murphy, 29 _ finished almost three hours behind
schedule.
   Despite the subway's well-publicized woes, the travelers'
assessment was favorable, beginning with a view of the sun rising
from the elevated J train Monday, and ending Tuesday morning with a
tasty eclair purchased at a shop in Manhattan's Columbus Circle
station. They even found roses awaiting them at the finish, a gift
from some Transit Authority employees.
   They said they went 15 hours before meeting their first
panhandler, and encountered just four in all. Only two cars were
significantly marked by graffiti.
   The riders took turns catnapping, and bought some snacks at shops
in stations. Although they brought along books and a tape player,
``we mostly looked out the window and relaxed,'' Temple said.
   The trio said the low point of their trip came Monday night on
the N line to Coney Island, a one-hour, 45-minute ordeal on an
unheated train that often slowed to a crawl behind a trash
collection train.
   ``We were questioning our sanity.'' recalled Vanner.
   When the trip began at 6:13 a.m. Monday at the Jamaica-Van Wyck
station, the riders expected to be on the rails for 27 hours. But
various mixups _ including a rerouting during rush hour on Tuesday
morning _ forced them to improvise.
   With 466 stations and 232 miles of track, New York City's subway
system is easily the nation's largest, and by some measures _
including the number of cars and stations _ the world's largest.

   A special U.N. General Assembly session in
Geneva to hear PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on the Palestine problem
will cost the world body about $645,500, a U.N. official said
Tuesday.
   The General Assembly voted this month to meet in Geneva to hear
Arafat after the U.S. State Department refused him a visa to speak
at U.N. headquarters in New York. U.S. officials said they took the
action because Arafat was tied to terrorism.
   Arafat spoke on Tuesday and asked Israeli leaders to join peace
talks.
   The move to Geneva represents the first time in the 43-year
history of the United Nations that a session has been moved to
protest a decision by a host country.
   All U.N. member states, including the United States and Israel,
will be assessed for their share of the costs, said Fred Eckhard,
the U.N.'s chief financial spokesman. Israel also opposed granting a
visa to the chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The United States will be asked to pay 25 percent of the special
session's costs, totaling $161,375. Israel will be assessed their
usual 0.2 percent, totaling about $1,420.
   Washington's U.N. Mission sent its permanent representative, Gen.
Vernon A. Walters, two political advisers, and a legal counsel, said
mission spokeswoman Caroline Dulin.
   Most costs of the session come from conference services and
travel, said Bock Cheng Yeo, a spokesman for the assembly's budget
committee.
   The costs of the session include: $390,200 for conference
services, such as overtime for translators and broadcast
specialists; $159,800 for air tickets for the president of the
General Assembly, a U.N. Secretariat officer, a security officer,
one delegate from each of the 40 least developed nations among the
U.N.'s 159 member states; and $67,700 for air tickets for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, seven of his senior staff
and 16 lower-ranking staffers.
   Yeo said an austerity measure taken last year by the General
Assembly made a deep cut in potential travel costs. Until last year,
five delegates from every U.N. member state were entitled to travel
costs for sessions outside New York. But the General Assembly cut
the allowance to one delegate only from the 40 least developed
countries.

<HEAD>Soviet Devaluation Of Ruble Seen As Token Step</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts see the Soviet promise to devalue the
ruble by 50 percent over the next two years as a welcome gesture _
but still just a gesture.
   ``Officially a ruble costs about $1.60, but on the black market _
in Tunisia, say _ you can get four, five, six rubles for a dollar,''
said Murray Feshbach, research professor in demography at Georgetown
University and a specialist in Soviet economics. ``So a 50 percent
devaluation is only a start.''
   The devaluation by January 1990 was announced in the Soviet press
on Friday. In the following year, an entirely new rate is to be
established.
   Under the Soviet decision, the first devaluation will be only for
trade purposes, so foreign visitors in Moscow will not find their
vodka or hotel bills any cheaper in terms of their own currency.
   ``It's very different from making the ruble into a convertible
currency,'' said Christian Paddet, an economist with Chase Manhattan
Bank in New York.
   Soviet officials have been saying that convertibility is their
ultimate aim but it is likely to be many years before that takes
place.
   In the major capitalist countries, currencies are freely
convertible; marks can be freely bought for yen and dollars can be
freely sold for francs, at prices set by international markets.
   This has never been the case with the Soviet ruble.
   Feshbach said the decision had been expected, and is an
indication that the Soviets are more ready to face economic
realities.
   He suggested that the new exchange rate, when it is actually
applied, could help Western businesses that engage in joint ventures
now being encouraged by the Soviets.
   A ruble with a lower value in terms of dollars or marks could be
an advantage to such enterprises if the cheaper ruble enables them
to spend less of their own currency to pay for Soviet labor or goods.
   ``Of course, that depends on the prices the Soviets set,''
Feshbach said.
   ``If they raise the prices at the same time as they devalue, the
advantage would be reduced.''

<HEAD>Mayor Withdraws City Support For New Year's Celebration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. has canceled the city
government's participation in the annual New Year's Eve celebration
because of concerns over crime and cost, but organizers said it will
go on under private sponsorship.
   Officials of the Old Post Office Pavilion, a complex of
restaurants and shops that was focus for the party, said they
learned last month that Barry planned to call off the mass event.
But they said Tuesday they will have their own party with big band
music, dancing and other festivities targeted for the 35-45 age
group.
   ``We feel that it's an important tradition in Washington,'' said
Christine Masterson, Pavilion marketing director.
   Each year that event attracted revelers to downtown Washington,
including an estimated 100,000 poeple last year.
   On Monday, Barry withdrew city support for the celebration,
citing the city's $150 million budget deficit and a drug and crime
wave that has pushed the capital's homicide total to a record 347
this year.
   In a radio interview, Barry said canceling the event will save
little money. But, he said, ``I think we're in serious times now,
with the crime being what it is and the drug epidemic. It's no time
to celebrate, it's a time to work hard and to pray.''
   The cancelation spells the end for Barry's ambitious hopes for
the New Year's celebration, which began in 1983.
   Barry boasted in 1986 that it would surpass New York City's
celebration in Times Square, which attracts about 1 million people,
and become a major tourist attraction in the revitalized
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor between the White House and the Capitol.
   But a slaying during the 1986 celebration, along with 15 arrests
and reports of fighting and bottle throwing by youths, led Barry to
make the entertainment more family-oriented.
   In the past two years, the city moved to ensure safety at the
celebration by limiting alcohol sales, adding police protection and
changing the musical program.

   The State Department blamed the leftist

mayors and two other officials in the past seven months.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said all nine were elected
representatives and that five were killed in November alone.
   ``The communist insurgents apparently view popular support for
democracy not as an opportunity but a threat,'' he said.
   He said the people of El Salvador have embraced representative
government as the best way to achieve their aspirations.
   ``We salute the courage of the mayors of El Salvador who risk
their lives to serve the people of their communities,'' he said.

   A 50 percent pay increase for 2,500 top federal
officials was recommended Tuesday by a presidential commission which
said members of Congress should quit pocketing fees from
special-interest groups in exchange for heftier checks from the
taxpayers.
   ``I think the pressure on Congress to get rid of honoraria is
going to be very strong,'' said Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the
Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries, after
the panel unanimously adopted its recommendations. ``In my view, it
will be irresistible.''
   The commission recommended that members of Congress and federal
district judges, who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000. The
House speaker would go from $115,000 to $175,000, and majority and
minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000. Top executive-branch
officials such as cabinet members would get boosts from their
current $99,500 to $155,000.
   The proposed pay increases officially will be forwarded on
Wednesday to President Reagan, who can then accept or modify the
figures before sending his budget to Congress on Jan. 9.
   Under the law, unless both the House and Senate vote to head off
the pay increases, they automatically will take effect 30 days
later. Congressional supporters of the increases hope to avoid any
votes, although opponents are unlikely to let the clock expire
without a fight.
   The pay commission also said Congress should act to give the
president, whose salary has been fixed at $200,000 since 1969, a
raise to about $350,000. Such an increase could not take effect
until 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising a
president's pay during his term.
   Commission members conceded that the recommended increases will
appear huge to taxpayers. But Cutler noted that baseball players,
even ``.200-hitting utility infielders, receive more than a district
court judge or a member of Congress or a deputy secretary of state.''
   And they said the cost of the increase would be relatively small,
about $128 million overall in fiscal 1990. ``These numbers are
probably no more than what gets spilled at the Pentagon every day,''
said Cutler.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the panel's action ``is
bound to be encouraging to the nation's federal judges. The
commission's salary recommendations would restore to those judges
the cuts in real income which have been caused by inflation over the
last 20 years.
   ``Not only the judges, but everyone interested in attracting to
the bench capable men and women for a lifetime of service will be
well served if the president and Congress follow these
recommendations,'' Rehnquist said.
   Top federal workers' buying power has declined 35 percent on
average since 1969, when the salaries first were adjusted under the
commission's recommendations. Tuesday's proposal was an attempt to
play catch-up with two decades of inflation.
   It also was a way of tempting Congress to wean itself from the
burgeoning practice of seeking speaking fees from interest groups,
and giving lawmakers the political cover they need to accept a pay
raise. The self-styled citizens lobby, Common Cause, noted that
lawmakers had accepted a record $9.8 million in such fees in 1987.
   The pay recommendations directly affect about 2,500 top federal
jobs, and indirectly impact another 10,000 high-level positions
where pay is tied to salaries in the top echelon.
   In its report, the commission cited testimony that top federal
positions are going begging for talented people because of the huge
discrepancy between government salaries and private-sector pay.
   Cutler noted that the average top executive-branch worker now
stays on the job just 18 months. ``They barely get to understand
their jobs before they leave because of inadequate salaries,'' he
said. Cutler added that senior research posts at the National
Institutes of Health have gone unfilled for 10 years because the
government can't attract top talent, he said.
   But ``Of all three branches, the most appealing case is the case
of the judges,'' Cutler said. ``Judges are leaving in droves to
return to far more lucrative law practices ... Soon they'll all be
millionaire Wall Street lawyers. You won't have blacks on the bench,
you won't have women on the bench.''
   The panel made it clear that it intended the raises to go
hand-in-hand with a ban on honoraria _ not only speaking fees, but
other ways in which special-interest groups could funnel money to
lawmakers to buy access and influence.
   ``It is our devout intent that there be this quid pro quo,'' said
commission member and former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo. ``We view
that as an ample full-time salary, in return for which we expect ...
Congress will outlaw all forms of honoraria conceivable to man.''
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader called the pay recommendation ``a
shameless salary grab'' and predicted a public revolt. ``The public
is saying, `You are freezing the minimum wage and asking for a pay
increase.''' Top public officials already make several times the
average working American's salary, he said.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, said he would oppose the pay increase and
called on colleagues to scrap the law that lets such raises take
effect without a vote.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has publicly advocated
doing away with honoraria, will favor whatever salary level Reagan
proposes, said an aide to the speaker.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip, predicted the pay
raise will ultimately take effect. ``The opportunity to beat up on
this thing is great,'' he said, but ``The reality is that people
with college-age kids can no longer be involved in public service.''
   The American Bar Association embraced the commission's
recommendations for the judiciary, saying ``many of the men and
women serving today on the federal bench are making extraordinary
financial sacrifices in order to remain on the bench, and many
others who would aspire to the bench are finding the financial
sacrifices too great.''
   The National Taxpayers Union said Reagan ``should ignore these
outrageous recommendations ... This scheme was designed to fool the
voters and enrich the Congress.''
   Tuesday's recommendations were similar to those proposed by the
commission in 1986. At that time, Reagan reduced the levels before
submitting them to Congress. The Senate voted to reject the pay
raises, but the House allowed the 30-day clock to expire before
voting and the increases took effect.

   A test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome
that takes only five minutes and can be performed without
sophisticated equipment was approved Tuesday by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The new test, called Recombigen HIV-1 Latex Agglutination Test,
uses an engineered protein and microscopic beads to detect
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS.
The test costs about $10 and is designed for use only under
supervision of medical professionals.
   ``This technical advance should help make testing available to
all who want to be tested,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said.
``It will also be particularly useful in remote areas of the world
that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests.''
   The test also may be useful, he said, ``as a preliminary
screening measure in emergency situations in this country.''
   Young said the test is not designed to replace the more accurate
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, now used to screen
donated blood. And both the Recombigen and ELISA require a
confirming test called the Western Blot because of possible false
positive results.
   Recombigen consists of microscopic latex beads coated with an
engineered protein taken from a portion of the outer surface of the
AIDS virus. The protein is produced by inserting a portion of the
AIDS virus genetic material into the genes of a bacteria. The
bacteria then produces the AIDS protein. The protein is refined and
then applied to the surface of the beads.
   To conduct the test, a sample of blood is mixed with the coated
beads. Within five minutes, any AIDS antibodies in the blood sample
will form clumps, a process called agglutination.
   This clumping then can be detected by a medical profssional under
a strong light.
   The test is much faster than ELISA and Western Blot, which take
several hours and require sophisticated laboratory equipment.
   An FDA announcement said false-positive reactions can occur in
the test ``because of interpretation errors, some medical conditions
and problems of sample quality that do not ordinarily affect the
ELISA test.''
   The announcement said a positive result using the new test must
be verified with repeat testing using a fresh blood sample and by
the Western Blot test.
   Recombigen is manufactured by Cambridge Bioscience Corp. of
Worcester, Mass., and distributed by Baxter Health Care Corp.

   Palestinians said Tuesday they saw progress
in Yasser Arafat's speech to the United Nations but expressed doubt
that Israel would accept the PLO peace plan.
   Israeli officials dismissed the appeal, and U.S. officials said
his speech did not meet conditions Washington has set for dealing
with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said: ``We know what
hides behind his words. We know that as they are spoken acts of
terror continue.''
   Abdul-Jawad Saleh, deported mayor of the West Bank town of El
Bireh, said: ``Even if Arafat comes out and writes Shamir a letter
saying `I recognize the state of Israel, I condemn terrorism, I stop
terrorism,' Shamir would say `Go to hell.'''
   Saleh, who lives in Amman, was among many Palestinians who
listened to a live radio broadcast of the PLO chairman's speech
Tuesday to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva.
Television stations in Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar and Abu Dhabi also
carried the address live.
   Arafat urged Israel to join U.N.-sponsored peace talks intended
to produce a peace settlement based on security for all nations of
the region, including Israel and a Palestinian state.
   King Hussein of Jordan, visiting Paris, said on French
television: ``Chairman Arafat has responded to every demand of the
United States. I know what was requested of the PLO as I was
personally involved in the past.''
   The United States has set three conditions for a dialogue with
the PLO: that it clearly recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce
terrorism and accept U.N. resolutions that give all nations of the
region the right to exist within secure borders.
   U.S. officials said Arafat's speech was interesting but did not
meet the conditions.
   In Washington, Swedish Embassy spokesman Lars Romert said his
country served as a ``messenger'' between the U.S. government and
PLO. He said the Palestinians sought clarification of American
conditions for official dealings.
   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, foreign minister of Egypt, followed Arafat to
the podium in Geneva and said: ``I call on Israel ... to respond to
this positive Palestinian proposal to reach a just and lasting
peace.''
   Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, the only Arab
nation to have done so. Jordan and Egypt have been essential
elements in virtually every U.S. peace proposal since Israel was
born in war 40 years ago.
   Rami Khoury, a Jordanian journalist and publisher, said of
Arafat's speech: ``I think its very positive and ... historic. Its
really the first time ... in a practical way that the PLO's
acceptance of coexistence and the two-state solution has been taken
to the next level of a practical series of steps.''
   Khoury said Israel, the United States and some European countries
demanding specific conditions from the PLO ``have so painted
themselves into a corner that when Arafat offers to make peace, they
say, `No, you've got to say the words in this order.'''
   Many Palestinians said they oppose further concessions until the
PLO gets something in return from Israel and the United States.
   ``What more do they want from us?'' asked Khalid Saadi, a
38-year-old Amman businessman. ``Recognition cannot come from one
side. Israel has to recognize the Palestinian state and the
Palestinian people.''
   Mohammed Hamdam, a physician, said: ``We call on the whole world
to understand that what was asked of the PLO was given.''

   Some of Congress' most visible and
controversial perks _ the $1,000 breakfast, the $2,000 lunch and the
$10,000 all-expenses-paid tours of defense plants _ came under fire
Tuesday from a presidential commission.
   The panel, while recommending 50 percent pay increases for top
federal officials, suggested that members of the House and Senate
honor their part of the bargain by dumping their honoraria.
   The commission said members of Congress should be paid $135,000
instead of $89,500, but they should give up the speaking and writing
fees that brought in a record $9.8 million in 1987, up 30 percent
over 1986.
   Unlike bureaucrats and judges, members of Congress are free to
use their positions to collect speaking fees, most often from lobby
groups and trade associations with a stake in a member's votes in
committee or on the floor.
   ``The potential for abuse or the appearance of abuse is obvious
to the public,'' the salary commission said in a report to President
Reagan. ``The only principled argument that can be made for the
practice of accepting honoraria is that official salaries are too
low.''
   This put the commission in line with longtime honoraria critics
like Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the self-styled
citizens lobby.
   ``The growing practice of accepting honoraria from special
interests raises intolerable conflicts of interest and gravely
undermines the integrity of Congress and the public trust in
government,'' Wertheimer said Tuesday.
   There is no limit on how much a member can make through
honoraria. The 1987 Capitol Hill champion, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
the Illinois Democrat who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee, pulled in $245,000.
   There are limits, however, on how much a member can keep. The
Senate has a limit amounting to 40 percent of official salary, or
$35,800. The House's limit is 30 percent of salary, or $26,850.
There is a $2,000 cap on a single honoraria payment.
   To keep within the limit, Rostenkowski gave $219,156 of his 1987
honoraria earnings to various charities, leaving $25,844 for
himself. The Senate's top honoraria earner in 1987, Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., made $106,050 on the speaking circuit, gave
$80,000 to charity and kept $26,050 for himself, neary $10,000 less
than he could have kept.
   Neither man nor any of their colleagues would suffer an earnings
cut under the commission's plan. A senator now keeping honoraria to
the limit would be $9,700 ahead of the current system if the pay
goes to $135,000. A House member at the limit would end up $18,650
ahead.
   According to financial disclosure statements, 87 senators
received $3.1 million in honoraria in 1987, keeping $2.3 million, or
nearly 74 percent. In the House, 390 of the 435 members shared $6.67
million and kept about 78 percent of it _ $5.24 million.
   Rostenkowski, Dole and Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., were the only
lawmakers in the six-figure honoraria league. The average take among
the 87 senators was $36,069, with an average of $9,433 going to
charity. The average House member who accepted speaking fees took in
$17,122, giving $3,686 to charity.
   The money doesn't flow equally to members or have much apparent
relevance to speaking ability.
   Committee and subcommittee chairmen, who play pivotal roles in
shaping legislation, are far more popular than back-benchers when a
trade association is looking for someone to address a luncheon.
   A lawmaker's committee assignments frequently can be divined from
a list of his or her honoraria sources: banks hire members of the
banking committees; defense contractors favor defense committee
members for their speakers.
   The defense industry has also come up with the multi-honorarium
junket. Pentagon contractors get together and fly a group of
lawmakers to California, where they are housed and fed and take
turns touring five plants and making speeches at $2,000 a pop.

   South Africa, Cuba and Angola signed a
U.S.-mediated peace plan Tuesday stipulating that South-West Africa
will become independent and 50,000 Cuban soldiers will leave Angola.
   Western-backed rebels fighting the government of Angola were not
included in the agreement, which would end only foreign fighting
there.
   ``This will bring an end to international conflict in
southwestern Africa,'' said Chester Crocker, the U.S. diplomat who
was the agreement's chief architect. ``It is the end of a sad
chapter in African history.
   Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said
the accord was achieved in large part through U.S.-Soviet
cooperation.
   Crocker's negotiations on South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, were a central element in the Reagan administration's
``constructive engagement'' policy toward South Africa, which
Congress rejected in favor of sanctions.
   Applause by black African diplomats and officials interrupted
Foreign Minister R.F. Botha of South Africa when he declared
Tuesday: ``A new era has begun. My government is removing racial
discrimination. We want to be accepted by our African brothers. We
need each other.''
   South Africa clearly sees the agreement as a chance to improve an
international image marred by its apartheid system of racial
discrimination and end conflict that has cost hundreds of millions
of dollars and killed hundreds of white soldiers.
   Botha signed for South Africa in a ceremony attended by the Congo
president, Denis Sassou-Ngueso, whose government has been host to
several negotiating sessions. Meetings leading to the agreement
began in May.
   Also signing the agreement Tuesday were Angola's military chief
of staff, Antonio dos Santos Franca, and Ricardo Alarcon Quesada,
Cuban deputy foreign minister. Alarcon said it begins ``a new era of
peace.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also hailed
the pact.
   ``We hope that this major diplomatic milestone in southern Africa
will be followed by renewed efforts to settle the internal conflict
in Angola through a process of national reconcilation and peaceful
negotiation among Angolans,'' he said.
   The agreement, to be formalized in a treaty scheduled for signing
Dec. 22 in New York, does not end the civil war in Angola but bars
the involvement of South African and Cuban forces.
   Pro-Western guerrillas of the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA, have fought the Marxist government of Angola since
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Some African leaders have expressed hope the withdrawal of Cuban
and South African troops would lead to negotiations between Angola
and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels, who have been supported by South
Africa and the United States.
   South African military sources reported new fighting Monday
between Angolan soldiers and UNITA.
   Whatever the course of Angola's civil conflict, the agreement, if
carried out successfully, would end 22 years of sporadic bush
warfare in Namibia, a territory rich in minerals that South Africa
has controlled since capturing it from Germany in World War I.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has been
fighting South Africa for control of Namibia from bases inside
Angola, welcomed the pact Tuesday.
   ``We are happy that at long last our people will be able to
exercise their right of self-determination,'' said spokesman Hidipo
Hamutenya.
   He said his group's forces in Namibia will observe an informal
cease-fire and fight only ``if provoked or cornered.''
   The League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate, but the U.N.
General Assembly withdrew it in 1966 and has tried since then to get
the South Africans out.
   Botha said implementation of a U.N. independence plan will begin
April 1 and elections are expected seven months later.
   Speaking to reporters on the flight from Johannesburg to the
Congolese capital, he also said the plan calls for 3,000 Cuban
troops to leave Angola before April 1. All 50,000 are to be out
within 27 months.
   About half the Cubans are expected to be withdrawn by the time
elections are held in South-West Africa about Nov. 1, 1989. Most of
those remaining are to move north, at least 350 miles from the
Namibian frontier.
   Prisoners of war are to be exchanged and a joint commission will
be formed to resolve disputes. Cuba and Angola are to negotiate an
agreement with Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general,
for verification of the Cuban withdrawal.
   Politicians in Windhoek, the territorial capital, reacted with
wary approval.
   Andreas Shipanga, a black Namibian who is Cabinet chairman in the
transitional government, said of the day when the independence plan
is supposed to go into effect: ``April Fool's Day. I don't trust
that date, but we'll accept it.''

   Is Santa Claus a compulsive shopper? Why are his
favorite colors red and green, the colors of rage and envy? And does
he really drink?
   In the decidedly non-Christmas spirit of self-promotion, a Boston
advertising agency Tuesday unveiled an ``expose'' by one Rudolph
R.N. Reindeer that ``lays bare the sad truth behind the ho, ho, ho.''
   One year after taking on Santa as a client in search of a yuppie
image, the firm of Heller Breene shoots down the myth of Kriss
Kringle via a book written by the disgruntled reindeer called ``A
Stocking Full of Lies.''
   Fed up with being No. 2, Rudolph tells a lurid story of a Santa
Claus paranoid over shopping mall imposters, perpetually struggling
with obesity, a man ``who buys everything in sight and gives it all
to total strangers.''
   ``And what exactly happened on Christmas Eve 1927 in Amsterdam?''
the agency writes in a synopsis. ``Rudolph and his fellow reindeer,
accustomed to waiting less than a minute above each chimney, found
themselves hovering for a full hour above this particular one.
   ``Santa maintains he got stuck, but if so, why was he blushing
when he eventually returned to the sleigh?''
   Tacky? Tasteless? Silly?
   ``Well, the truth hurts sometimes, you know,'' said Cheryl
Heller, the agency's chairman and creative director. ``If you think
about it, there have to be some terrific conflicts in a man like
Santa.''
   ``Who knows him better and who has a better ax to grind?'' she
said. ``All those years of playing second fiddle and being
unappreciated.''
   After billing itself as ``New England's hottest and most creative
agency,'' Heller Breene executives were red-faced to learn they
misspelled ``Rudolf'' on the glossy book-jacket ad accompanying a
news release quoting its own executives as well as the reindeer and
a Santa spokesman.
   Heller said the spelling was intentional. ``In becoming an
artiste now he has some creative expression,'' she said. ``It's like
Barbra Streisand.''
   The agency last year took on the Claus account to revitalize his
image and break with 600 years of tradition.
   The Santa biography is aimed at the flurry of kiss-and-tell books
published in 1988.
   ``It was not my intention to destroy Santa,'' Rudolph is quoted
as saying. ``But there are certain things the world has to know.
Beneath that cuddly image lies a disturbed and dangerous man. ...
Someone has to protect the children.''

   The National Commission on Working Women on
Tuesday honored the broadcast industry for making the 1980s ``a
decade of progress for women on television.''
   ``Our report shows progress in the treatment of women (on
television) over the past ten years and because of that, the
networks get a pat on the back,'' said Sally Streenland, who wrote a
study released by the commission entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time:
An Analysis of the Image of Women on Entertainment Television,
1979-1988.''
   The report, citing the expansion and diversification of female
characters in prime-time television, examined the portrayal of women
and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life
women during the decade.
   ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for women on television.
Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part,
more true-to-life,'' the report concluded.
   The commission also presented three new ``Milestone'' awards to
people who ``have made outstanding contributions to advancing the
role of women through the media.'' The recipients were ABC News
senior correspondent Carole Simpson; ``Cagney & Lacey'' TV series
actresses Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly and executive producer Barney
Rosenzweig, and National Public Radio.
   The study's examination of the 25 top Nielsen rated shows from
1979 to the 1988 fall season revealed that as the percentage of
working mothers increased in the workplace, so did their percentage
in TV portrayals.
   The study showed that 60 percent of TV's female characters worked
in 1979. Three-quarters of the TV women were single, 10 percent were
single mothers and 5 percent were married mothers.
   By 1987, 75 percent of the women Americans watched on television
worked; one-fourth were single, 15 percent single mothers and 20
percent married mothers, according to the report.
   Meanwhile, 1987 population statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau
showed 56 percent of all women were in the labor force; 25 percent
have never been married, 30 percent are married working mothers, 10
percent are single mothers and 25 percent are homemakers.
   ``The pat on the back is a somewhat soft one because despite the
growing diversity in these areas, television has been fascinated
with wealth for much of the '80s,'' said Streenland, citing
nighttime soap operas. ``There has not been that diversity
economically.''
   Streenland's study showed TV painting a much rosier picture than
actually existed of the types of employment women had.
   In 1979, more than 40 percent of television's women were employed
in clerical or service jobs with a corresponding percentage in
professional jobs. By 1987, only 23 percent of the women on TV had
the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers.
   The real life portrait was ``almost exactly reversed,'' with 47
percent in clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent
working in professional or managerial jobs. In the real world,
two-thirds of U.S. women earn $15,000 or less; only 1 percent earn
more than $50,000.
   The report also showed the percentage of black women on TV almost
tripled during the period studied. In 1979, there was only one black
female character, representing 8 percent of the women on TV that
year. By 1987, 22 percent of the women on TV were black.
   But only 2 percent of TV's women in 1987 were Hispanic, and there
were no Asian or other minority women depicted. In reality, 77
percent of women in the United States are white; 12.5 percent are
black, 7.5 percent are Hispanic and 3 percent are other minority
women.
   The commission also presented its annual ``Alice'' awards to
actresses, producers and journalists for excellence ``in portraying
working women's issues in radio and television'' at a luncheon
ceremony Tuesday.
   ``Since joining the commission and the broadcast awards program,
I more perfectly understand the importance of portraying real-life
situations,'' said actress Linda Lavin, whose waitress character
gave the commission's award its name. ``I think twice about the
roles I take and the programs I produce.''
   Carole Simpson, who won one of the Milestone awards, said, ``I
would have to say that entertainment has moved along further than
news has. ... It is still astounding to me that at my network there
are 115 correspondents and only 15 of them are women, that there is
no woman anchoring the news on a daily broadcast.''

<HEAD>Tax Lawyer Says He Advised LaRouche Not To File</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tax lawyer testified Tuesday he advised
political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. not to file federal
returns because he had no income, and that he was so uncaring about
his basic needs that he wore baggy suits and worn-out shoes.
   The lawyer, Mayer Morganroth of New York and Southfield, Mich.,
told a federal jury that LaRouche's publishers and political
supporters provided his food, clothing, housing and other
necessities to enable him to conduct research, write articles and
make speeches promoting his various causes.
   Morganroth said he believed the goods and services did not
represent income for LaRouche but were intended to benefit the
publishers and other LaRouche organizations, from whom LaRouche
``didn't get paid anything.''
   The lawyer said he gave his view of LaRouche's tax liability at a
1979 meeting with LaRouche and his chief accountant, Gerald Doherty,
and that his position was endorsed at a December, 1984, meeting with
Harold Dubrowsky, a Detroit lawyer for the prominent accounting firm
of Grant Thornton.
   At the second meeting, which LaRouche reportedly did not attend,
Morganroth quoted Dubrowsky as saying it was ``a totally defensible
position'' to say that LaRouche received no income and need not file
tax returns.
   Morganroth was a key witness called by defense attorneys to
testify on the 13th day of LaRouche's trial in U.S. District Court
on tax and mail fraud conspiracy charges.
   Another defense witness, Thomas Seay of Washington, who conducted
a year-long review of LaRouche financial records for the defense
team, said LaRouche was an employee of all the organizations under
his control but did not receive any taxable income. Seay agreed that
LaRouche and was not required to file any federal income tax returns.
   Under questioning by prosecutors, Seay conceded that he did not
have any access to financial records prior to July 1986 and which
were seized by federal agents who raided LaRouche's Leesburg, Va.,
headquarters in October, 1986.
   Seay also acknowledged under questioning that he did not know for
sure whether LaRouche received a minimum $1,080 in income, which
requires filing tax returns.
   LaRouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by failing to file returns for any tax year since
1978 and having all his personal expenses paid by various
corporations he controls.
   In addition, LaRouche and six associates are charged with mail
fraud and conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in
loans from supporters that they never intended to repay.
   If convicted of all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.
   Morganroth testified he didn't know who was paying LaRouche's
expenses but that ``it was assumed wherever he went he was provided
a roof and security so he could write and do research for his
writings.''
   Said Morganroth: ``His clothes were quite minimal. His shoes were
worn down. The suits he had on were baggy, like someone had thrown
them away. His teeth needed work on them. It was obvious he didn't
care for his daily needs.''
   The witness said he had not received even half of the estimated
$500,000 in legal fees he had charged the LaRouche organization for
his tax advice, and had written off $125,000 as a bad debt.
   Asked if he was a LaRouche supporter, Morganroth replied: ``Far
from it.''
   Another defense witness who testified Tuesday was Richard Morris,
a San Francisco corporate lawyer and former aide to William P. Clark
when Clark was deputy secretary of state, White House national
security adviser and Interior secretary during President Reagan's
first term.
   At the White House in 1982-1983, Morris said, he had numerous
conversations with LaRouche supporters who passed along their
concerns about Reagan's Star Wars plan for a space-based missile
defense system, terrorism in West Germany, Third World debt and
intelligence matters regarding the Soviet Union.
   Morris said he forwarded any credible information from LaRouche
supporters to specialists on the National Security Council staff.
But he heeded orders from U.S. intelligence agencies and refused to
give any information to LaRouche operatives in return.
   Morris said his contacts in the CIA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency warned him that ``LaRouche was a socialist, fascist,
communist, a member of the KGB and even a Democrat.'' But Morris
said that then and now he believed LaRouche supporters ``were acting
in good faith and in the best interests of the United States as they
saw it.''

   A widow has beaten the Louvre and its army of
high-powered art experts in a 20-year legal battle over ownership of
a 17th century painting that she has sold for $1.4 million.
   The Louvre bought ``Olympos and Marsyas,'' the rustic scene by
17th century landscape artist Nicolas Poussin, for $366 in 1968.
   But owner Suzanne Saint-Arroman, 78, won her fight in the French
courts and forced the gallery to take it out of storage and return
it to her.
   ``Olympos and Marsyas'' was sold Monday night at an auction house
off the Champs-Elysees for the equivalent of $1.4 million.
   ``My aunt was delighted, but she was very emotional because her
husband was not there to enjoy the victory,'' said a niece who
accompanied Mrs. Saint-Arroman to the auction.
   The niece said Mrs. Saint-Arroman would not comment because her
doctor advised several days' rest after the excitement. The niece
herself spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A Swiss man is the new owner of the painting. But he bid by
telephone and did not wish to reveal his identity, according to
Jacques Tajan, a spokesman for auctioneers Drouot-Montaigne.
   The Poussin affair began in 1968 when Mrs. Saint-Arroman's
husband, Jean, a mining engineer, decided to sell a family heirloom.
He chose a dark, shadowy painting executed between 1625 and 1628 of
scowling gods making music, surrounded by nymphs and a rosy-cheeked
infant holding up a crown of flowers.
   Saint-Arroman consulted auctioneer Maurice Rheims, who studied
the work with expert Robert Lebel. They attributed it to the
Carracci School, a lesser known group of Bolognese artists.
   The painting brought $366 at auction. But the Louvre _ whose
experts recognized it as a Poussin _ took advantage of its right of
``pre-emption'' under French law to acquire the picture at the last
bid price.
   Shortly after, Le Monde newspaper reported the Louvre had made
``a rare discovery ... akin to a shooting star'' with the purchase
of a Poussin for a scant sum.
   The ``shooting star'' turned out to be Saint-Arroman's painting
and he filed suit against the Louvre, the auctioneer and the expert.
   The case has been in court ever since. In 1972, the auction sale
was annulled by the Tribunal de Paris. The Louvre then took the
painting down and put it in storage, where it has been ever since.
   In 1984, Saint-Arroman died and his widow continued the fight.
   Three years later, after a series of appeals, a Versailles court
handed down a final ruling ordering the Louvre to return the
painting to Mrs. Saint-Arroman.
   In a statement, the French judge said the Louvre did not have the
right to use its vast resources, financed by the public, to cheat a
private citizen.
   ``The Louvre has so many resources _ experts, documents,
high-tech equipment _ which should all be in the service of
individuals and not used to make a profit at their expense,'' Tajan
said in an interview.
   But he said he considered the painting ``hardly a masterpiece.''
   ``It's a lovely, interesting historical document because of its
dark, somber style, which is characteristic of Poussin's early
period in which he was imitating other more popular painters of the
period,'' he said.

   A federal district court in New Orleans has
awarded the fund that insures savings institutions a $35 million
malpractice judgment against a law firm, regulators said Tuesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates federally
insured S&Ls, said the court awarded the judgment to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. against John Mmahat and his firm,
Mmahat and Duffy.
   Based on improper advice from Mmahat's firm, the Gulf Federal
Savings Bank, Metairie, La., repeatedly granted loans in excess of
bank board limits, the agency alleged.
   Mmahat was both chairman and majority shareholder of the bank and
head of the law firm, the bank board said. It said the firm
collected more than $5 million in legal fees from the bank between
1982 and 1985. The institution was placed into receivership in
November 1986.
   The bank board said the federal court award on Friday was one of
the largest malpractice verdicts on record.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government
now says its own warplanes, not Pakistan's, dropped the bombs last
weekend that killed 24 people in Kandahar province, Western
diplomats reported Tuesday.
   The initial Kabul radio report directed suspicion at Pakistan by
saying low-flying aircraft approached the southern province from the
east, but the diplomats said a later report admitted the Afghan air
force dropped the bombs.
   ``In a burst of unexplained candor, Soviet and regime media have
announced the attacks by Afghan aircraft of civilian targets in
Kandahar and ... announced an attempted takeover of the 2nd Corps
headquarters, Nov. 21, by disaffected officers,'' one of the
diplomats said. All spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Official reports of the attempted takeover said several renegade
military officers led 400 ``extremists,'' presumably a reference to
guerrillas, into the corps headquarters but the invaders were
repulsed.
   ``Whether or not these public statements of events, which would
have received much less notice otherwise, are intended to portray
the PDPA and regime as incompetent, they certainly are accomplishing
that end,'' the diplomat said.
   President Najib of Afghanistan is head of Afghanistan's Communist
Party, called the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, or PDPA.
There have been reports the Kremlin is easing him out.
   Diplomats corroborated guerrilla claims that portions of a
strategic highway linking the Afghan capital to Pakistan were closed.
   The road is a major route for food convoys to Kabul and the
eastern city of Jalalabad. Diplomats reported heavy fighting and
said ``many army wounded'' had been taken to Kabul.
   Guerrillas have stopped all vehicle traffic near Sarobi, 30 miles
east of Kabul, and travelers ``must walk for a number of hours
before finding transporation to continue their journey,'' a diplomat
said.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1978, and Soviet military forces entered the country
in December 1979.
   An estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan when a
U.N.-mediated agreement to withdraw them was signed April 14 in
Geneva. About half have been pulled out and all are to be gone by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   At least 3 million Afghan refugees live in towns and refugee
camps just inside the Pakistani border, which the guerrillas use as
bases and supply points. The rebels are supported by Pakistan and
the United States.

   A Palestinian shepherd crushed
a Jewish settler's skull with a rock Tuesday, grabbed his rifle and
fired on an army patrol, killing a soldier before other troopers
killed him, the army reported.
   Two soldiers were wounded, the army spokesman's office said.
   The deaths of the settler and soldier bring to 13 the number of
Israelis killed since a rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5
million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At
least 323 Palestinians have been slain and more than 7,000 wounded.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, Israel's West Bank commander, said the
attack occurred near near Berakha, a hilltop Jewish settlement two
miles south of Nablus. It took place shortly before PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat addressed the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva and
called for peace with Israel.
   Settlers at Berakha said Palestinians from Burin, the nearby
village where the assailant lived, had uprooted trees and planted
their own crops on settlement land.
   Mitzna told reporters the shepherd's family was involved in a
land dispute with the settlement, but whether that prompted the
attack was not clear.
   ``In the afternoon, an Israeli resident of Berakha was brutally
murdered by an Arab shepherd,'' Mitzna said. ``The shepherd crushed
the Israeli's head with a stone, then took his M-16 and ambushed a
military patrol.
   ``This shepherd is known to us. In the past, members of his
family sabotaged some tractors and plows in the settlement.''
   The 70,000 Jews who occupy 131 settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza are allowed to carry weapons for protection.
   Mitzna said the Palestinian killed the driver of a patrol jeep
and wounded an Israeli officer in the leg, and the army spokesman
said another soldier was slightly wounded.
   Soldiers in the jeep returned the fire, killing the shepherd,
Mitzna said. Arab sources said he was Hamdan Najjar, 25, and often
grazed his flock near Berakha.
   The settler, identifed as Yaakov Pereg, 33, was on routine patrol
outside the settlement, Mitzna said. Berakha, founded in 1981, is
home to about 20 religiously observant Jewish families.
   Soldiers put a curfew on Burin and searched the area.
   Mitzna and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, met
with settlement leaders Tuesday night. The settlers demanded that
Palestinian stone-throwers be deported from the occupied territories.
   Villagers said Jewish settlers entered schools in Burin earlier
in the day, ordering teachers and students to leave. A high school
principal was beaten, the residents said.
   Four Palestinians were wounded in confrontations elsewhere in the
West Bank, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the chest and right
arm at the Fara refugee camp near Nablus, hospital officials said.
   Soldiers imposed a curfew on the entire Gaza Strip, shouting
through megaphones they would fire on those who violated the order
confining all 650,000 Palestinians to their homes, residents
reported.
   The round-the-clock curfew was imposed in an effort to prevent
anti-Israeli violence after Arafat's address in Geneva.
   An Associated Press reporter taken on a tour of Gaza by the army
saw smoldering tires and watched patrols weave in and out of narrow
alleys hunting curfew violators. Two outlawed Palestinian flags
attached to helium balloons floated over Gaza City.
   Residents of the city went onto their balconies after Arafat
spoke. They exploded fireworks and emitted the shrieks and
ululations associated with Arab celebrations.
   In Nablus, West Bank Palestinians filled the streets and blared
recordings of the speech taped from Arabic radio stations. Some
burned tires and chanted nationalist songs while masked youths
danced, waving balloons and pictures of the Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman.
   In Jerusalem, police used tear gas to disperse Palestinian
elementary school children who blocked the entrance to their school
with rocks and raised Palestinian flags, Israel's national news
agency Itim reported. It said a similar event occurred near the
walled old city.
   Three Arab schools in the city were ordered closed until Sunday,
affecting over 2,000 students.

   The cold front in the northeast United States took a deadly toll
on New York City's homeless, killing as many as five people who
failed to find shelter, while warm winds in the Great Plains on
Tuesday brought record high temperatures.
   Two days and nights of bitter cold in the Northeast led
authorities to search for homeless on the streets.
   ``I don't recall when we had any numbers (of cold-related deaths)
this high,'' said Ellen Borakove, the spokeswoman for the New York
medical examiner.
   The temperature in New York City plummeted to 5 degrees before
dawn on Monday _ a record for the date _ and as low as 15 the next
night.
   The cold reached down to Florida, where residents in the northern
part of the state scraped frost from their windshields Tuesday
morning as temperatures dipped into the low 20s.
   Snowflakes were reported in portions of the Florida Panhandle.
   A rapidly moving weather system in the Northeast spread light
snow from the Upper Ohio Valley to the northern and middle Atlantic
Coast states. Snowfall was mostly about an inch or less, causing
some slippery driving.
   Another fast moving weather system brought a mixture of snow,
freezing rain and rain to portions of northwestern Minnesota,
northern North Dakota and northeastern Montana.
   The eastern slopes of the Rockies had high winds.
   Winds gusted to 69 mph at Squaw Mountain, Colo.; and also topped
60 mph in such towns as Casper, Wyo., Mines Peak, Colo., Boulder,
Colo.; Livingston, Mont., Cody, Wyo., Sheridan Wyo., Billings,
Mont., and Rollinsville, Wyo.
   The westerly winds along the east slopes of the Rockies resulted
in warm temperatures in the Great Plains states. Temperatures
reached the 60s Tuesday afternoon in western portions of the Great
Plains from Montana to Texas. Rapid City, S.D., with 64 degrees, and
Goodland, Kan., 73 degrees, set record high temperatures for the
date.
   Elsewhere, lowland river flood conditions continued to improve
slowly in Arkansas. A flood warning continued for the Sulphur River
Basin in northeastern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Altoona, Pa., State College Pa., and Limestone, Maine, to
81 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The low in the nation Tuesday morning was 8 degrees below zero at
Houlton, Maine, Glens Falls, N.Y., and Concord, N.H.
   For Wednesday, the National Weather Service forecasts snow or
snow showers in the northern and central Rockies, the northern half
of the Great Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper
Great Lakes. Snow is expected to most widespread over Colorado and
Wyoming. Show showers also are forecast from western New York to
northern New England.
   Highs are expected in the teens and 20s in the northern Rockies,
the northern Great Lakes, northern New England, North Dakota and
northern Minnesota; in the 30s and 40s from southern New England and
the mid-Atlantic states to the southern Great Lakes, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the central Plains, the central Rockies and much
of the intermountain west to the Pacific Northwest; in the 70s in
southern Florida, eastern and southern Texas and the desert
Southwest; and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Vietnam to Start Withdrawal of 18,000 Troops from Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam will start withdrawing
18,000 troops from Cambodia on Thursday in a weeklong transfer along
four land routes and down the Mekong River, army spokesman Lt. Gen.
Nguyen Van Thai announced.
   He told a news conference on Tuesday that the seventh partial
pullout will leave 50,000 Vietnamese troops fighting three Cambodian
guerrilla groups _ the communist Khmer Rouge and two non-communist
groups.
   Communist Vietnam's withdrawal, promised for completion by the
end of 1990, has raised fears that the Khmer Rouge will become the
dominant military force in the country and institute a second reign
of terror.
   But Thai told reporters the pro-Hanoi Cambodian army along with
the remaining Vietnamese troops can ``take care of themselves.''
   Thai said the largest single withdrawing element consists of
6,000 troops and 300 vehicles that will begin a five-day trek across
the length of the country Thursday from Battambang and Sisophon in
northwestern Cambodia to Vietnam's Tay Ninh province in the east.
   One infantry division and an engineer regiment will leave Phnom
Penh, the Cambodian capital, by boat down the Mekong River, which
flows into southern Vietnam, he said.
   Vietnam says it has withdrawn 32,000 troops so far this year and
with this week's 18,000 it will have pulled out the 50,000 it
promised to send home in 1988. Some Western diplomatic sources in
Bangkok said recently that only 15,000 to 20,000 were withdrawn so
far this year.
   But Western analysts, after describing earlier announced pullouts
as ``mere troop rotations,'' say Hanoi appears serious about leaving
most of the fighting to the Phnom Penh government and husbanding its
stretched resources for domestic economic development.
   The analysts and sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hanoi's military presence in Cambodia has seriously fractured its
ties to the Western world, China, Japan and other countries. The
United States has said it will not establish diplomatic ties until
after a total pullout.
   But concern also has arisen that the Khmer Rouge, estimated at
between 30,000 and 40,000, will prove stronger than either the Phnom
Penh army or its own Cambodian allies and make another grab for
power.
   Before being toppled by Vietnam's invasion force in early 1979,
the Khmer Rouge forced Cambodia into a brutal, regimented society.
Hundreds of thousands died in forced labor communes and mass
``killing fields.''
   Western diplomatic sources estimate the Phnom Penh army's
strength at 44,000 regular soldiers, and the combined strength of
the non-communist factions uneasily allied with the Khmer Rouge is
about 27,000.
   Thai said some units returning to Vietnam will be demobilized as
part of a major reduction of the country's massive military strength
over the next few years. The reduction would involve more than
300,000 personnel, Thai said.
   With more than a million regular soldiers under arms, Vietnam
fields the world's fifth largest armed force after the Soviet Union,
China, the United States and India.

   Two gunmen walked into a car
repair workshop Tuesday and shot to death its owner at point-blank
range, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for killing John
Currie, 31, but suspicion fell on the mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting to drive the British out of
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   Published reports said Currie, a Protestant, repaired vehicles
owned by members of the security forces. The IRA repeatedly has
warned civilians against carrying out work for the police or other
security personnel in the province.
   The gunmen singled out Currie from among several of his
colleagues in the workshop in Portadown, 25 miles southwest of
Belfast, said police Inspector Fred Campbell. They escaped in a
hijacked car whose owner was held captive in a disused house in
nearby Lurgan, Campbell said.
   Currie was the 54th civilian to die this year in political and
sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. More than 2,700 people have
been killed in nearly 20 years of violence in the province.

   The wife of confrontational talk-show
host Morton Downey Jr. has filed a countersuit for divorce, claiming
he humiliated her.
   Kim Downey filed a lawsuit Monday in Superior Court in
Hackensack, saying her marriage of 10 years was an emotional ordeal
during which she was forced ``to remain submissive.''
   In an earlier divorce claim, Downey, an Englewood resident who is
host of a syndicated talk show from WWOR-TV in Secaucus, charged his
wife was moody and often burst into jealous rages.
   The lawsuit filed by Mrs. Downey says that Downey has been having
an affair with a woman since spring. Downey on Monday denied having
affairs while living with his wife but acknowledged he has seen
other women since the two split up five months ago.
   ``We're going to go get down to the Tyson-Givens game, are we?''
Downey said, referring to the prominent disputes between heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson and his wife, Robin Givens. ``Well, I'm good at
it.''
   The couple had no children. Downey has three daughters from
previous marriages.

<HEAD>Heiress Ingested Sedative Before She Died, News Agency Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A news agency reported Tuesday
that Greek heiress Christina Onassis took a significant dose of a
sedative before she died last month, but it did not blame her death
on the drug.
   Responding to the report, the friend who was hosting Ms. Onassis
when she died said the drug was for the heiress' housekeeper and
ruled out any possibility of suicide.
   ``I'm surprised, and I can't believe it,'' Mrs. Marina Dodero
said of the report. ``I doubt it, and the forensic results are not
in.''
   The private news agency, Noticias Argentinas, drew no connection
between Ms. Onassis' death and the barbituate, which it identified
as Optalidon. The agency based its report on judicial sources it did
not identify.
   Ms. Onassis, the 37-year-old multimillionaire daughter of the
late Aristotle Onassis, died Nov. 19 at the country home of Mrs.
Dodero.
   Initial reports said she apparently suffered a heart attack, and
a preliminary coroner's statement said the death was caused by a
buildup of fluid in the lungs. Federal Judge Alberto Piotti is
directing an inquiry into what caused the accumulation of fluid to
determine whether the death was from natural causes.
   Piotti's secretary told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview Tuesday that final forensic reports have not been
submitted to the judge. ``We don't have knowledge of that
information'' about the sedative, the secretary said.
   Mrs. Dodero said in an interview with a Buenos Aires television
station that the heiress ``was afraid of taking medicine.''
   She said the Optalidon was for Ms. Onassis' housekeeper, Heleni
Syros.
   Ms. Onassis' family ruled out last month any possibility that Ms.
Onassis committed suicide.
   ``She was completely happy,'' Mrs. Dodero said Tuesday. ``She
would never take an action of that kind because of the enormous love
she had for her daughter,'' 3-year-old Athena.
   The child will inherit most of her mother's wealth, estimated at
$500 million. Christina Onassis' father, who was married to
President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline Kennedy, built his fortune on
shipping and real estate.

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department is reviewing a
request by one of the country's major railroads to eliminate random
tests as part of a drug testing program for railroad workers,
officials said Tuesday.
   CSX Transportation Inc. filed a petition with the Federal
Railroad Administration this week asking that a railroad not be
required to conduct random drug tests if it already has a ``proven''
drug testing program under way.
   The DOT maintains that random testing is an integral part of an
effective drug testing program for transportation workers involved
in safety related jobs.
   But CSX, one of the nation's largest railroad companies, said
random testing ``is at best an untried experiment'' and that there
are other methods to combat drug abuse problem in the railroad
industry.
   FRA Administrator John Riley said the petition ``will be given
full and fair consideration,'' as will any other suggestion for a
modification of the drug testing requirements that were announced
last month.
   Unions representing 200,000 railroad workers sued Tuesday in
federal court in San Francisco, challenging the drug testing program
in the railroad industry.
   The suit contends random drug testing, without suspicion of
current drug use, violates constitutional standards for searches. It
also contends the FRA has no legal authority to order random testing.
   A suit by the unions in the same court resulted in a ruling by
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February prohibiting
post-accident drug testing by railroads without reasonable suspicion
of individual drug use. That case was one of two drug testing cases
argued before the Supreme Court last month; no ruling has been
issued.
   The Transportation Department on Nov. 14 said millions of
transportation workers, including railroad workers, will be subject
to a broad range of drug tests beginning in December 1989.
   The random tests have been strongly opposed by labor, but most
transportation companies have endorsed them as being necessary.
During a series of hearings on drug testing, CSX was the only
railroad that opposed random testing.
   In its petition, CSX said it does not believe the evidence
supports random drug testing as the most effective means of
combating drug abuse in the industry.
   CSX asked that a railroad be exempted from the random testing
requirement if it can show that its existing drug testing program
``works as well or better than the expectations of random drug
testing.''
   ``Random testing in the railroad industry is at best an untried
experiment with many admitted unknowns,'' CSX said in a statement.
``That belief is based not on supposition, but on (the railroad's)
actual experience.''

   A judge on Tuesday ordered the assets of
the troubled PTL television ministry sold to a Toronto real estate
developer for $65 million.
   Stephen Mernick, a 34-year-old Orthodox Jew, bid $36.25 million
on Monday in a session at Heritage USA headquarters near Fort Mill,
but after meeting Tuesday with attorneys for the ministry and for
the creditors, he agreed to increase his bid to $65 million.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds approved the sale at a
hearing in Columbia, just more than a week after PTL founder Jim
Bakker and three former associates were indicted by a federal grand
jury in North Carolina.
   The Heritage USA theme park and accompanying satellite television
operation were left behind by Bakker in March 1987 after it was
revealed he had a sexual liaison with New York church secretary
Jessica Hahn and paid her to keep quiet about it.
   The ministry filed for reoganization under bankruptcy laws in
June 1987, and attempts to sell it had included two auctions before
Tuesday's session. The sessions Monday and in November produced no
acceptable bids.
   Included in the sale were 2,200 acres of property, a 500-room
hotel, a water park, a television studio and a 2,000-seat church.
   Reynolds polled major creditors and nearly all approved the sale
to Mernick, saying they believed it was the best deal they would get.
   Mernick would take over the administration and operations 41 days
after Reynolds approved the sale and closing would be 60 days later.
   ``We're excited,'' Mernick told reporters outside the courthouse.
``We're very excited and happy we won. We look forward to being
here.''
   He would not answer questions about plans for Heritage USA,
including whether Heritage Ministries, the non-profit religious
spinoff, would be able to continue leasing the television ministry
and church at Fort Mill.
   Mernick has said he was buying the property as an investment but
would considering keeping Heritage USA operating as a Christian
theme park.
   ``We are in the middle of ongoing discussions'' with Heritage
Ministries, Mernick said.
   Mernick's family has roots in Toronto real estate that go back 40
years, but he was little known outside the area's Orthodox Jewish
community until March when he purchased the old Firestone Canada
Inc. tire plant in Hamilton, Ontario.
   His holdings include a landfill in the Toronto area, a 50 percent
interest in a local waste disposal and recycling company, and
wholesale and retail travel agencies.
   Had no acceptable bid been submitted, PTL would have been broken
up and sold, court-appointed bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
said after Monday's failed auction.
   Bidders this week also included Michael Karas, president of First
Canadian Development Co. of Toronto; Sam Johnson, president of PTL's
religious operations who is trying to get major contributors to buy
back the ministry; and Cy Bahakel, owner of 15 television and radio
stations.
   Bahakel, a former North Carolina state senator, said his partner
in his attempt to by PTL's assets is George Shinn, majority owner of
the Charlotte Hornets basketball team. Shinn considered buying
Heritage USA last spring, but never made a formal bid.
   Faison Barnes, an attorney for Bahakel, objected to the bidding
procedures.
   ``It appears to us that was a negotiated deal between yesterday's
auction and the appearance in court today,'' Barnes told reporters.
``We're going to very careful consideration to an appeal.''
   Johnson acknowledged that Heritage Ministries was about $1
million behind in lease payments to PTL, but said he remained
confident that contributors would eventually back the effort to buy
back Heritage USA.
   Johnson said Mernick told him, ```We want to work with you. We're
sensitive to your needs.'''
   A month ago, Mernick said he would pay $115 million, $50 million
in cash. But Reynolds rejected the bid, saying there were inadequate
assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65 million.
   The offers Monday were far below the total appraised value of
PTL's assets _ $92 million to $110 million. In an appraisal dated
Aug. 18, Arthur Little & Co. of Atlanta said PTL's assets would be
worth $76 million to $85 million if sold piecemeal.
   The grand jury that indicted Bakker on Dec. 5 is scheduled to
reconvene Jan. 17, a source familiar with the investigation said
Tuesday in Charlotte. The source demanded anonymity.
   The panel has accused Bakker and former top aide Richard Dortch
of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money to support their own
``lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.
   Two other former aides, brothers David and James Taggart, each
were indicted on six tax charges.
   Bakker _ who has avoided reporters since his indictment _ and the
others are to appear in court Thursday.

   Ken Needham hopes Americans' hunger for
Louisiana-style spicy cooking will call for a matching thirst. He's
selling beer with pepper in it.
   Needham has introduced Cajun Beer, a brew that combines the
tastes of cayenne pepper, cane sugar and beer.
   ``Cajun has been here (in America) for 250 years, and it's here
to stay,'' said Needham, 68, of Paw Paw in southwestern Michigan.
   Needham's isn't the only Cajun brew on the market. The
proprietors of Mulate's restaurants, authentic Acadian eateries in
Baton Rouge and Breaux Bridge, La., recently began marketing their
own style of Cajun beer, distributed primarily in Louisiana.
   Needham's beverage is produced at Pabst Brewing Co.'s Milwaukee
facility and is being distributed to bars and restaurants in eight
Midwestern and Plains states. Distribution is to being next month in
several more states, including Louisiana.
   If all goes well, the beer, which sells for $5 per six-pack, will
be available in stores next year.
   Needham hopes the beer is hot but not, well, too hot.
   ``I was looking for a medium-style European beer with seasonings,
but I didn't want you to taste the seasonings in the beer until
after you had swallowed it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Asks 15-Year Sentence For Brezhnev Son-in-Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state prosecutor has asked for a sentence of 15
years in prison at hard labor for the late Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, who is on trial for
corruption, Tass reported on Tuesday.
   The official Soviet news agency said prosecutor Alexander Sboyev
summed up his case on Monday and Tuesday and that defense lawyers
will take the floor ``after a short interval.''
   Churbanov was first deputy interior minister before Brezhnev died
in 1982. He is accused of accepting more than a million dollars in
bribes to protect a criminal network that extended throughout the
southern republic of Uzbekistan.
   The trial of Churbanov and eight other defendants has been the
centerpiece of a recent campaign aginst the Brezhnev era, whose
18-year rule in the Soviet Union is portrayed as a time of
corruption and stagnation.
   Churbanov, now 51, married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971 and
almost at once began rising rapidly to the upper echelons of the
interior police force.
   ``The state prosecutor regarded the bribe as a malicious
instrument of corrupted consciousness, which become simply monstrous
in the hands of law enforcement bodies,'' Tass said.
   ``The defendants held key posts in Soviet law enforcement bodies
whose duty it is to fight against injustice, embezzlement, state
deceit and, of course, bribery in all its forms.''
   Churbanov was accused of accepting $1,133,000 in bribes, but
Sboyev suggested a reduction to $675,000 in the amount of money
Churbanov allegedly took since it could not be proven that he had
accepted the rest of the money.
   Sbobyev also recommended reducing the sum of bribes allegedly
accepted by Khaidar Yakhayev, a co-defendant who also faces 15 years
at hard labor.
   The prosecutor recommended sentences for the seven other
co-defendants ranging from six to 13 years in hard labor camps.
   He asked that all property of the defendants be confiscated.

   Twenty people were convicted Tuesday in
connection with a plot to kidnap Italian actress Laura Antonelli and
other prominent figures.
   The leader of the gang, 39-year-old Croce Simonetta, was
convicted of criminal association with intent to kidnap and
sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison.
   Other defendants received terms ranging from seven years to one
year, eight months.
   The prosecution said Simonetta organized a group to carry out a
series of kidnappings in Tuscany, with Ms. Antonelli and local
industrialists as intended victims.
   When Florence police broke up the ring in 1986, they found the
group had already prepared hideouts to hold their kidnap victims.
   Ms. Antonelli's credits include roles in the 1975 movie ``Divine
Creature'' and Luchino Visconti's 1976 film ``The Innocent.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers investigating the death of
a colleague arrested and beat several civilians on the same day
Haiti's military ruler delivered a speech on human rights, radio
stations said Tuesday.
   The unidentified air force soldiers on Saturday invaded Tiremasse
Street, a poor neighborhood in the capital city of Port-au-Prince,
after hearing of the death of Sgt. Fouille Grand-Champ, the
state-run newspaper L'Union said Tuesday.
   Radio stations and the privately run TeleHaiti said Grand-Champ
killed himself after shooting and wounding his fiancee, Leone
Germain. L'Union said the soldiers heard that Grand-Champ had been
assassinated.
   A number of civilians were released after being beaten and
slapped, news media reported. Haiti-Inter radio said the soldiers
clubbed a schoolgirl as they walked down Tiremasse Street.
   The beatings came on the same day that Haitian ruler Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril spoke on the human rights achievements of his
3-month-old government. Haiti last week ratified five international
human rights conventions.
   ``Soldiers take justice into their own hands ... These are the
signs of the inexistence of justice in this country,'' Arnold
Antonin, co-director of the National Network for the Defense of
Human Rights, told The Associated Press Tuesday.
   Rank-and-file soldiers named Avril as president after ousting
former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a coup on Sept. 17, saying
they were sickened by state-sponsored violence.
   Namphy came to power after former President-for-Life Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986.

   The intruder ate several bologna sandwiches, drank three 16-ounce

   Welsh legislator Brynmor John, who served in the
Labor governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan during an
18-year career in the House of Commons, died Tuesday. He was 54.
   John suffered a heart attack while walking outside the Houses of
Parliament and died at nearby St. Thomas's Hospital, the hospital
said.
   He retained his parliamentary seat in the Labor stronghold of
Pontypridd in south Wales with a huge 17,277 majority in the June
1987 general election. He first won the seat in June 1970.
   John served as an undersecretary in the Ministry of Defense under
Wilson in 1974-76 and as a minister of state at the Home Office
under Callaghan from 1976 to 1979.
   He was Labor's opposition spokesman on Northern Ireland in
1979-80, defense spokesman in 1980-81, social security spokesman in
1981-83 and agriculture spokesman from 1984-87.
   John, a lawyer, is survived by his widow, Ann Pryce, a son and a
daughter.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock called him ``one of the most effective
and decent members of the Labor Party and a valued colleague in
Parliament.''
   Labor's spokesman on Welsh affairs, Barry Jones, said John ``had
the heart of a lion. He was a politician of integrity, respected by
all, and with an unswerving devotion to his constituency.''

   Marxist rebels looted government buildings and
battled police at a river port during a jungle raid that left three
people dead, authorities said Tuesday.
   In the Andes Mountains, Maoist guerrillas killed an army officer,
a mayor, and a policeman in three separate incidents, police also
said.
   Two guerrillas of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a
pro-Cuban group, and a villager were killed Sunday when the
insurgents clashed with police defending Puerto Inca. The town is on
the bank of the Pachitea River 135 miles northeast of Lima.
   About 50 rebels ransacked and looted a government development
office and two state banks before they were driven off, police said.
   The Tupac Amaru group began attacks, mainly in Lima and other
urban centers, in 1984.
   In the Andes, a larger Maoist guerrilla group known as the
Shining Path executed an army captain, police said. He was in
civilian dress, but the rebels checked his identification and
dragged him from an interstate bus Monday near Concepcion, 120 miles
east of Lima, authorities said.
   They said other Shining Path insurgents on Monday executed Mayor
Alfredo Chamorro in the village of Pallanchacra near Concepcion.
   Also Monday, police and rebels from the group were reported to
clash at a mountain pass near Cuzco, 355 miles southeast of Lima. A
policeman was killed and five Shining Path guerrillas were wounded,
police said.
   The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to topple Peru's
elected government. It is not believed to maintain ties with the
Tupac Amaru group.
   The government says more than 12,000 people have died in violence
stemming from the Shining Path insurgency.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
remained hospitalized Tuesday for further medical tests but will
probably get out by the weekend, officials said.
   The 71-year-old Marcos, who was hospitalized last Friday with
chest pains, was listed in stable condition Tuesday at St. Francis
Medical Center.
   Dr. Calvin Wong, a cardiologist, said Tuesday in a statement that
Marcos would be given a general physical examination Wednesday and
was expected to be discharged before the weekend.
   Wong said earlier Marcos had weak heart muscles and was prone to
congestive heart failure but that his heart condition had stabilized.
   Although his heart condition has stabilized, hospital spokeswoman
Norma Kop said Marcos had undergone neurological tests and a ``bone
scan'' and would have more tests Wednesday.
   Marcos faces federal racketeering charges in New York accusing
him of plundering his nation's economy during his 20-year rule and
stashing some of the money in the United States.
   He was to be arraigned in New York, but he and his lawyers
contend he is too frail to make the 10-hour flight. A
court-appointed doctor who examined him before his most recent bout
of hospitalization concluded that he did have medical problems but
not severe enough to prevent him from traveling. That same doctor
also concluded that Marcos faked claims of being in pain during the
medical examination, an allegation that Marcos' spokesmen deny.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, has pleaded innocent to the same charges
and is free on bail. They have lived in exile here since being
ousted from the Philippines in 1986.

<HEAD>Stepdad Driving One of 3 Cars That Hit And Kill Teen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man driving a car on a dark road
hit a bicyclist who turned out to be his stepson, police said. The
boy died after he was then hit by two other cars.
   Larry Dean Kelley, 16, was hit from behind as he pedaled along a
curve just before daybreak Monday.
   ``In the flash of the headlight I saw his black nylon jacket, his
blond hair coming our from under his hat and the black bicycle
frame,'' said his grieving stepfather, Richard Hogenson. ``As I
heard the thud and was bringing the car to a stop, I thought, `Gee,
I hope that's not Larry.'''
   He added, ``I saw him just before impact and I didn't have time
to slow down.''
   Young Kelley was was thrown over the roof of Hogenson's car. A
second car then hit him and a third car dragged him 45 feet along
the road, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The teen-ager was
pronounced dead at the scene.
   Hogenson, who estimated he was driving at about 50 mph, said the
accident was unavoidable from the moment he saw the bicycle at a
distance of about 10 feet.
   Trooper William Bishop said the speed limit on the unlighted road
is 55 mph, and the bicycle had reflectors but no light. The boy's
dark clothing was also a factor in the accident, Bishop said.
   ``It's very coincidental, but we have nothing to say otherwise,''
Bishop said.
   Kelley, a high school sophomore, had moved out a number of times
after conflicts with his parents in the past three years, most
recently Dec. 2, the stepfather said. He was staying with friends.
   ``Larry was a lot like most teen-age kids. He was going through
the typical teen-age upheavals,'' his stepfather said. ``He was a
nice kid. He was very independent. He wanted to do things his own
way.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top leaders of the governing
party and the major opposition party clashed Tuesday night over
charges that an opposition mayor took part in killing an election
official.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, the nominee of the governing Christian
Democrats in the March 1989 presidential election, said that Mayor
Antonio Vasquez of Soyapango was among several people who forced
Francisco Eduardo Bonilla from his car Monday night and shot him.
   He said Eduardo Bonilla was in the process of registering
Soyapango residents to vote at the time of the shooting.
   Alfredo Cristiani, presidential nominee of the right-wing
Nationalist Republican Alliance, said a party investigation turned
up nothing to link Vasquez to the killing. Vasquez is a member of
the Alliance, known as Arena.
   Christiani told a news conference in San Salvador that an Arena
investigation ``has found no evidence that involves (Vasquez) as the
author of the murder.''
   The Arena leader accused the Christian Democrats of using the
incident for political purposes and said, ``It's the judicial
tribunals and not politicians or candidates who can give
conclusions.''
   He said his party would cooperate with official investigations
and that ``if anyone is found to be involved, we would be the first
to say that all the weight of the law should fall against the guilty
one.''
   Christian Democratic officials said Vasquez was among a group
that forced Eduardo Bonilla and several companions to get out of the
car in Soyapango, four miles north of San Salvador, the capital. One
of those who got out was beaten and Eduardo Bonilla was shot when he
tried to intervene, they said.
   There was no official confirmation of the account.
   Elsewhere, a land mine exploded Monday under a train carrying
railroad employees in central El Salvador, killing one person and
injuring five, officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on
Tuesday that they suspected leftist rebels laid the mine on the
track near San Vicente, about 37 miles east of San Salvador.
   A passing railcar triggered the blast, they said. It was carrying
a work crew to repair damages from a recent railway explosion, they
said.
   In Washington on Tuesday, State Department spokesman Charles
Redman blamed leftist guerrillas for the deaths of nine elected
officials in the past seven months and declared:
   ``The communist insurgents apparently view popular support for
democracy not as an opportunity but a threat.''
   Marxist-led guerrillas are pitted in a 9-year-old war against the
U.S.-supported government. More than 65,000 people, most of them
civilians, have been killed.

   A 9-year-old asthmatic boy died after paramedics
refused to enter the public housing project where he lived, and the
boy's mother disputed officials' claim that the ambulance waited for
police protection because it was pelted with eggs.
   ``We'll pull our radio tapes and speak to people and try to get a
blow-by-blow of what happened,'' Fire Department spokesman Bill
Crowley said Tuesday.
   He refused to identify the two paramedics.
   The paramedics, summoned by an emergency call at 4:16 p.m.
Monday, were not aware of the seriousness of the Carl Jarnagin's
health problem when they arrived at the six-story Chicago Housing
Authority building on the South Side, Crowley said.
   And when they arrived, Crowley said, ``there were different
objects hitting the vehicle.''
   He said egg was on the windshield and other objects, possibly
stones, also hit the ambulance. He said the paramedics were not sure
where the objects were coming from or who was throwing them, that
they left and returned with police protection, too late to revive
Carl.
   But the boy's mother, Sharon, said she had been outside the
building trying to flag down a cab to take Carl for help. ``No one
was out there,'' she said. ``My daughter was looking out the window
for the ambulance _ no one was outside.''
   Other residents of the housing project said nothing was being
thrown at the paramedics when they initially refused to enter the
building.
   A secretary for the CHA's Local Advisory Council at the Dearborn
Homes, which include the building where the incident occurred, said
residents told her nothing was thrown.
   The secretary, Sandra Falls, said ambulance workers refused to
enter the building for 15 to 20 minutes, even with police there.
Another Fire Department spokesman, Thomas Sheppard, denied that.
   Under Fire Department policy, paramedics should avoid placing
themselves in danger, even if that means a delay in treatment to a
victim, Sheppard said.
   Paramedics often are accompanied to CHA buildings by police or a
fire unit, making the trip into some high-crime areas safer, Crowley
said. ``Going into the projects alone is a problem.''
   ``There was no one throwing rocks out the window,'' said Randy
Taylor, a resident. ``There was just, I think, fear of the black
community.
   ``I used to have asthma, and this happened to us several times.
My mother used to have to ... scuffle around trying to get me to the
hospital when I was a little boy.''
   The building has 48 apartments, and most residents are black.
   Crowley said he did not know the race of the paramedics. But a
resident who lived a floor above the Jarnagins, 23-year-old Sherry
Teague, said both were white.
   After police arrived, she said, she begged the paramedics to come
to the apartment where the boy was having an asthma attack.
   She said the paramedics complained of having things thrown at
them, and refused to immediately go upstairs.
   ``The lady was saying `We're not going in there,'' Miss Teague
said. ``I'm not going to get my head busted with people throwing
things.'''
   She said she knew of nothing being thrown.
   Crowley was uncertain when paramedics arrived at the building,
but he said they left at 4:28 p.m. Police arrived at 4:34 p.m., and
the ambulance returned six minutes later, he said. Paramedics worked
to revive the boy for 30 minutes before taking him to Mercy
Hospital, where he died, Crowley said.
   An autopsy showed the boy died of bronchial asthma, according to
an intake worker at the Cook County medical examiner's office who
identified himself only by his last name, Morris.
   Morris said he was unsure if the autopsy showed if the boy could
have been saved with quicker treatment. Dr. Margarita Arruza, who
performed the autopsy, was in a meeting and not immediately
available, a secretary said.
   Police received a call for help from the Fire Department at 4:21
p.m., said Officer Charles Marschke. Police entered the fifth-floor
apartment, found the boy ``unresponsive'' and on a floor, tried to
revive him and called for the paramedics to return, he said.
   The police report did not mention whether the ambulance had been
attacked, Marschke said.
   Crowley said the paramedics were upset over Carl's death. ``It
was so frustrating for them that this child passed away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Council Votes To Allow Health Insurance AIDS Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council on Tuesday
passed congressionally mandated laws allowing insurance companies to
test health insurance applicants for the AIDS virus.
   The council enacted the insurance law despite a raucous, angry
protest from about 250 gay advocates who disrupted the council's
proceedings. About 50 were removed from the council's chambers and
five were arrested on disorderly conduct charges, police said.
   The AIDS testing measure repealed a 1986 ban on such testing that
the council had enacted in an effort to head off discrimination
against homosexuals.
   In response to the 1986 ordinance, insurance companies in the
district had simply stopped writing new health care plans, and
Congress had threatened to cut off its $537 million payment to the
city for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 if the law was not
changed.
   The council also replaced its requirement that all city employees
live in the city with a plan that gives preference to city residents
for all city jobs. Congress pushed that system on the city after
reports that the police department and city agencies were having
trouble recruiting workers from the city's applicant pool.
   Under the plan, residents exercising the ``preference'' option on
their applications would be required to live in the city for five
years, at which point they would be free to move to the Maryland or
Virginia suburbs.
   The council also passed a law guaranteeing that city buildings
will be opened to homeless persons if all the city's shelters are
filled on nights when the temperature drops below 25 degrees
Fahrenheit.

<TEXT>
   The captain of an Indian merchant says he was
following a course given by the Navy and was advised he was out of
the danger area 40 minutes before his ship was hit by a U.S. Navy
practice missile, killing a crewman.
   Navy officials said they could not confirm the captain's account
of the accident that occurred in the Navy's Pacific Missile Range 80
miles north-northwest of the island of Kauai at about noon Monday.
   ``The missile range gave us a certain course to steer and (later)
advised us we were clear of the area,'' said Capt. P.M. Mirchandani,
34, who brought the 550-foot Jag Vivek into port here Tuesday for
repairs.
   Lt. Cmdr. Gary Shrout, a spokesman for the Navy at Pearl Harbor,
said the captain's contention and ``everything about this thing will
be investigated. It'll take a while to put all the pieces together.''
   An FA-18 ``Hornet'' attack fighter from the aircraft carrier USS
Constellation fired a 12-foot unarmed Harpoon missile toward a
target hulk ship many miles out to sea, the Navy said.
   ``Unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough to
the path of the merchant vessel for the missile's seeker to guide on
it instead of the original target,'' the Navy said.
   Attorney Leonard Alcantara, representing the ship's owner, said
the Jag Vivek was notified by radio at about 8 a.m. Monday it was in
restricted waters of the Pacific Missile Range.
   The Navy gave the ship a new course to get out of the area, and
two or three hours later ``said the ship was clear and wished it
`Bon Voyage,''' Alcantara said. ``Forty minutes later, the missile
hit.''
   Mirchandani said he believed ``it was the Navy's mistake.''
   When the missile was fired, the jet was about 45 miles from the
freighter, too far away for it to see the ship, Shrout said.
   The supersonic missile tore through the living quarters located
near the top of the pilot house on the stern of the ship that is
carrying 25,600 tons of wheat from Vancouver, B.C., to Bombay,
officials said.
   After exiting the structure, the missile fell into the ocean,
according to the Coast Guard.
   Shrout said the commander of Naval Base Pearl Harbor, Rear Adm.
Stephen Chadwick, went aboard the Jag Vivek just before it reached
Honolulu ``to express the Navy's condolences to the master of the
ship.''
   The Constellation and seven other ships in its battle group were
concluding training exercises en route to a Western Pacific
deployment, the Navy said.
   Several thousand square miles off the Pacific Missile Range
Facility on Kauai's northwest coast are frequently closed to
civilian vessels with advisories broadcast at set times each day on
marine radio frequencies, according to the Coast Guard.
   The missile hit a five-story pilot house on the ship's left side,
below a porthole in the radio room.
   The impact collapsed part of the pilot house and killed radio
operator K.T. Joseph, 36, an Indian citizen, the Navy said. An
autopsy was to be performed Tuesday.
   The Indian government declined comment on the accident.
   The ship would remain here until it was decided whether the U.S.
Navy would pay for repairs, which are expected to take about two
weeks, said Coast Guard spokesman Scott Hartvigsen.
   The ship is owned by the Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd. of New
Delhi. Hawaii Pacific Maritime, its Hawaii marine agent, refused to
release details of the incident pending a prelimininary
investigation.

   The governing party's new chairman said
Tuesday that a national referendum will be held next year to seek
public endorsement of President Roh Tae-woo's administration.
   Park Joon-kyu said a date will be announced in the next two or
three months.
   Park was named chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party
last week, when Roh replaced his Cabinet members and party leaders
to defuse national furor over abuses under the rule of his
predecessor and former ally, Chun Doo-hwan. In another reshuffle
Tuesday, Roh replaced 19 governors and officials at the vice
minister level.
   Park was vague when asked what Roh would do if he lost the
referendum.
   ``If the result is miserable, if defeated, we have no choice,''
he said.
   Democratic Justice leaders have said Roh would not step down,
even if he lost. A simple majority, or more than 50 percent, would
be considered approval of the Roh government, Park said.
   Roh has asked the nation to forgive Chun, who went into rural
exile after apologizing for misdeeds under his rule. But the
opposition accused Roh of failing to take strong action against Chun
and demanded that Chun be forced to testify before National Assembly
committes investigating past wrongdoings.
   Several of Chun's relatives and associates have been charged or
convicted of corruption.

<HEAD>Farm Group Cancels San Francisco Meeting Over Grapes Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Farm Bureau Federation said
Tuesday it will not hold its 1991 annual meeting in San Francisco
after the city's Board of Supervisors voted to support a boycott of
table grapes.
   ``We must interpret the vote as an indication that we are not
welcome,'' said Dean Kleckner, the group's president.
   About 3.7 million farmers belong to the organization, and between
6,000 and 10,000 usually attend the annual meeting, said spokesman
Jack King.
   The supervisors, on a 8-2 vote Monday, endorsed the boycott urged
by the United Farm Workers union, which claims harmful pesticides
are used on table grapes.
   The resolution calls for the city to stop its annual purchase of
about $4,500 in grapes for jail inmates and patients at city
hospitals.
   Eight farm groups, including the farm federation, last week
threatened to cancel conventions if city supervisors backed the
boycott.
   The Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that San Franciso
could lose $60 million in convention-related business.
   In 1982, the farm federation canceled another convention in San
Francisco when the supervisors endorsed a lettuce and banana boycott.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suspension of NATO tactical fighter
training flights after the deadly crash of a U.S. jet will have a
significant impact on the alliance's air defense readiness, a U.S.
official said Tuesday.
   The A-10 Thunderbolt II jet crashed Thursday in a residential
neighborhood in the central city of Remscheid. Six people were
killed, including the American pilot.
   On Monday, defense officials of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization said all tactical training flights over West Germany
would be halted until Jan. 2 in memory of the victims.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson Anderson said of the
suspension: ``There will be significant readiness impact due to the
stand-down and there will be some readiness standards that will not
be met.
   ``Almost half of the U.S. (Air Force's) tactical forces in Europe
are located in the Federal Republic (West Germany),'' Anderson said
at a news conference. ``So it's a substantial amount of force and a
substantial amount of flying on a daily basis.''
   But he said the ``the extent of that impact has yet to be fully
assessed.''
   Anderson is commander of the U.S. Third Air Force, which is
stationed in Mildenhall, England. The pilot of the jet was under his
command.
   Anderson said it was the first time training flights had been
suspended for such an extended period, and he expressed concern that
it set a precedent for suspensions after future accidents.
   The Remscheid accident renewed a public outcry against military
flights over residential areas.
   Before the crash, 12 major accident involving military aircraft
killed 95 people this year alone. They included 70 people people who
died in an air show crash at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein in
August.
   Anderson denied West German published reports that U.S. soldiers
carrying rifles and truncheons roughly prevented residents from
entering their stricken neighborhood.
   ``U.S. personnel were not carrying weapons (rifles) or any kind
of clubs,'' he said.
   He said a squad of U.S. military police officers with pistols
were dispatched to the site after the crash but were pulled out a
few hours later.
   U.S. officials have said security efforts at the scene were
handled largely by West German troops and police.
   Anderson also denied allegations by West German officials that
American authorities mishandled the rescue efforts and delayed
releasing information about the plane and its munitions.
   He said more than $114,000 has been paid in property and other
claims after the accident. Under agreements with West Germany, the
U.S. pays about 80 percent of the claims total.
   Meanwhile, government sources said on condition of anonymity that
the parliamentary undersecretary of defense, Peter Kurt Wuerzbach,
would resign in January.
   Wuerzbach's decision to order a suspension of the West German air
force's low-level training flights immediately after the crash
angered Defense Minister Rupert Scholz, who was in the United States
at the time.

<TEXT>
   Graceful, joyful, young and charming are unusual
words to apply to Pilobolus, the modern dance company once intent on
figuring out how many ways athletic human bodies could fit together
like spoons and other bent and curved implements.
   But they're the words to describe the company of six dancing to
early recordings by Elvis Presley. ``I'm Left, You're Right, She's
Gone'' had its New York premiere on Tuesday's opening night at the
Joyce Theater.
   Between songs, Dale Reeves, sounding a lot like Presley, gave
dating advice to the ``adolescent'' dancers. ``I'm Left'' isn't
predictable enough to be nostalgia; sometimes it's a bit rude; it's
always fun.
   The two women wear strapless, full-skirted dresses for dancing,
chew bubblegum, wear cheerleading boots and knee pads for being
dragged around the floor. They're also occasionally strangled. In
one song they're passive. In another, after the voice admits, ``I
used to be shy,'' Jack Arnold, Jim Blanc, Austin Hartel and Peter
Pucci approach with increasing confidence. Carol Parker judo tosses
them all to the floor.
   To ``Tutti Frutti,'' Jude Sante shook her seat, sending two of
the men into a twitch and the audience into laughter. The final
song, ``Blue Moon,'' was a series of slow lifts but young swiftness
was back for taking showy bows to ``Shake, Rattle and Roll.''
   The six people who danced it and four more are listed as
choreographers.
   The evening began with ``Carmina Burana, Side II,'' using garbage
cans as props and unlike any other dance company's depiction of this
Carl Orff music.
   Dancers stick their rears into the cans and roll around the
floor. They stick their heads into them and dance, only their legs
and feet showing beneath, like dancing cigarette packs in early TV
ads. A man and woman inside cans scoot their cans together, roll
across the floor, then split.
   Sometimes dancers have tiny painted heads riding on their own
heads, making their arms look out of proportion. It's all for fun.
   Five people choreographed ``Bonsai'' in 1979. Four, looking like
primitives, dance to animal and drum sounds. This is of the
pressed-together-like-spoons school. Austin Hartel's brief solo,
``Pseudopodia,'' with backward somersaults and shoulder stands,
dates from 1974 and has choreography by Jonathan Wolken. Wolken and
Moses Pendleton, who studied dance at Dartmouth College and
cofounded the company in 1971, also compopsed the music.
   Pilobolus will alternate three programs at the Joyce Theater
through Jan. 8.

   President-elect Bush has asked U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter to be the new agriculture secretary
and has settled on Samuel Skinner of Illinois for secretary of
transportation, presidential transition sources said Tuesday.
   Yeutter earlier Tuesday declined to discuss reports that he was
still under consideration for the agriculture post after he
initially stated he would rather return to private life. But a
source close to Yeutter said he was considering the offer.
   The 58-year-old trade representative told reporters as he arrived
for a Capitol Hill luncheon that his ``proclivity was to return to
the private sector,'' but he added, ``I've learned never to say
never.''
   For the Transportation Department job, transition sources said
Bush has chosen Skinner, 50, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago who
has headed the Regional Transportation Authority in the Chicago area
since 1984.
   Skinner's wife, Sue, said Tuesday night in a telephone interview
from their home, ``I assume he probably will be (appointed
transportation secretary). But I don't think it's been totally
confirmed with him yet.'' Skinner, whose reputation for toughness
has earned him the nickname ``Sam the Hammer,'' was not at home and
could not be reached immediately, his wife said.
   Announcements on the two Cabinet posts could come Wednesday or
Thursday, one source said.
   Two transition sources said Bush had planned to meet Tuesday
evening with Yeutter, an ex-farmer from Nebraska who formerly served
as chief executive officer of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   But Yeutter's daughter, Kim, said that although her father was
attending a party at Bush's home Tuesday evening, a formal meeting
between the two would not be held until Wednesday.
   The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions that Bush
tried to persuade a reluctant Yeutter to take the agriculture job by
suggesting that he would not be expected to serve a full term.
Citing unidentified transition sources, the newspaper said Bush told
Yeutter that he would be expected to stay only through the first
summit conference of the leaders of the Western industrial
democracies, a meeting which Bush has said he wanted to devote to
agricultural issues.
   Meanwhile, rumors circulated that an announcement on the defense
secretary position was imminent.
   But Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff and co-director of the
transition office, said Tuesday the timing on any such announcement
was still up in the air as the FBI continued background checks on
prospective nominee John Tower, a former senator from Texas.
   Fuller said he expected a Bush to name ``a couple more Cabinet
positions'' this week and that the Cabinet should be filled by
Christmas.
   The field of contenders changed somewhat with Bush's decision
that he'll pick no one from Congress for Cabinet posts.
   Several members of Congress had said they were being considered
for high-level positions in the new administration. But Bush is
putting an end to that, telling them in notes and telephone calls
that it was more important for them to retain their spots in the
Democratic-controlled House and Senate.
   ``The vice president has several friends in the Congress ... who
had expressed an interest in doing something in the departments and
agencies, and he really just decided it wasn't fair to deplete our
strength in Congress by pulling Republicans out,'' said Fuller.
   There was no word Tuesday on the biggest question about an
unfilled position: When, or whether, Bush would name Tower as
secretary of defense.
   Bush, asked about it Tuesday, said, ``The process is still going
forward.'' Fuller said timing of any announcement on the job was
``completely up in the air'' while Tower's background is reviewed.
He noted that Bush still could pick someone else.
   ``We've been working on some of the other agencies,'' he said,
adding that he expects Bush to announce ``a couple more Cabinet
positions'' later this week. He declined to specify which ones.
   Bush spoke briefly to reporters after meeting with
President-elect Carlos Andreas Perez of Venezuela. Responding to
questions, Bush said:
   _He and Perez discussed Latin American debt, Nicaragua and other
subjects, and ``the relationship is off to a very good start.''
   _Bush's administration taking office Jan. 20 could not meet with
the Palestine Liberation Organization based on Yasser Arafat's
speech Tuesday in Geneva. Other officials said Arafat's speech
failed to meet U.S. requirements such as explicit acceptance of
Israel's right to exist and renunciation of terrorism. ``We've got
to get a much clearer statement of everything,'' Bush said.
   As for the Cabinet, Tower is undergoing detailed background
checks covering such matters as his defense industry connections and
allegations made by his ex-wife in their divorce case, various
sources close to the Tower and the transition have said.
   There have also been reports that the Bush team wants to name
Tower's top aides at the Pentagon at the same time the secretary is
chosen, thereby making sure they will be Bush choices.
   Fuller said of Tower, ``There's been the assurance that he would
be involved in the review and evaluation of senior appointments to
the Defense Department should he be chosen as secretary.''
   Sources close to Tower say the FBI could complete its background
work this week. However, checks on other defense appointees could
delay the announcement further.
   For energy secretary, Fuller said Peter Johnson, former head of
Oregon's Bonneville Power Administration, is ``still in the
running'' after being interviewed by transition aides Monday.
   Former Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana also is under consideration.
   Saying ``a lot of work needs to be done'' in the nuclear area,
along with the department's traditional focus on oil and gas
interests, Fuller said, ``We're looking for somebody who has got the
technical, scientific and management background to deal with that
side of the equation.''
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas has been mentioned as a possible
energy secretary because he is an expert in waste cleanup.
   Bush, meanwhile, met Tuesday with Coretta Scott King, widow of
the slain civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. Mrs. King said
the president-elect reiterated that he would name a black to his
Cabinet.
   ``We didn't mention names,'' she said. She gave a positive report
on the meeting, telling reporters, ``The goals of him and his
administration are very close to the goals I would like to see.''
   One black contender for a Cabinet job is Dr. Louis Sullivan,
president of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. Fuller said he
was on ``a short list'' the transition team is looking at for
secretary of health and human services.
   Other people Fuller said are still in contention for various
positions are Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Mrs. Dole, once mentioned as a possible United Nations
ambassador, a post since filled, has been spoken of recently as a
potential head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Kemp was considered a contender for secretary of housing and
urban development, but a transition source said he no longer was
under consideration for the Cabinet.
   Fuller said Constance Horner, head of the Office of Personnel
Management, ``is certainly on short lists for consideration in a
couple of areas,'' including labor secretary.
   Robert Teeter, co-director of the transition office, said there
was ``no basis'' to the rumor that he had turned down an offer to be
deputy White House chief of staff. Teeter, reached at his home in
Ann Arbor, Mich., said he was spending a few days sorting out what
he wanted to do next year.

   Part of a floor on a building under
construction gave way as workers were pouring concrete, injuring
five men in a 40-foot fall into the basement, authorities said.
   Police said a sixth worker avoided falling by hanging onto a
support when only one edge of the floor held.
   ``It gave way almost like a trap door. It swung down,'' said
police officer Richard F. Bates.
   ``When we first arrived, there was some panic that something else
would fall,'' Bates said. ``There were pieces of concrete and pieces
of Styrofoam falling.''
   The men were working on a raised main floor of the Fuller
Laboratories building under construction at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute, school spokesman Michael Dorsey said. They fell from
there to the sub-basement level.
   ``There just wasn't anything underneath (the main floor),''
Dorsey said. ``The main level is about two stories up from the
street.''
   Police said the workers, employed by D and M Concrete Flooring
Co. of Fall River, were taken to the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center.
   The five were identified as Jose Robeiro, 43, of Clinton, Kenneth
Gould, 48, of Worcester, Carlos Sousa, 31, of Hudson, Joao Mello,
33, of Clinton and William Cunningham, 39, of Stoneham.
   None of the workers were believed to have suffered critical
injuries, said a University of Massachusetts nursing supervisor.
Robeiro was admitted in stable condition, while the other four
injured workers were being transferred to another hospital.

   Survivors of the Armenian earthquake are
starting to freeze to death at night and just a fraction of the
thousands of tents sent to the disaster area have reached the
homeless, Pravda said today.
   As hopes dimmed for the living who remained trapped under rubble,
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov blamed shoddy construction for the huge
death toll and acknowledged that rescue efforts had been plagued by
disorganization.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, demanded prosecution of the
``scrap-builders'' who put up apartments that crumbled into
``concrete and metal graves.'' The death toll from Wednesday's quake
in seismically active northwestern Armenia was estimated at up to
60,000 people. Half a million were homeless and 6,000 were
hospitalized, Ryzhkov said.

   Yasser Arafat's chief spokesman says he hopes the
PLO leader's speech today to the U.N. General Assembly will lead to
PLO contacts with Washington, which had barred Arafat from
addressing the body in New York.
   Arafat was expected to seek worldwide backing for the newly
proclaimed Palestinian state. About 2,000 troops were deployed at
the United Nations' European headquarters and at Geneva's airport in
preparation for Arafat's arrival and the General Assembly session _
the first outside New York.
   The three-day meeting was moved to Geneva after the United States
refused Arafat permission to enter the country, saying he condoned
terrorist attacks by his Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Lawmakers who say it's hard to make ends meet
on $89,500 a year are hoping 1989 will bring them a substantial
boost in pay.
   A presidential commission reviewing the government's top pay
levels was poised today to recommend hefty salary increases for
members of Congress, federal judges and senior executive branch
employees. The recommendations will attach firm dollar amounts to
broad principles outlined in a draft report issued by the commission
last week, in which the panel said salaries should generally restore
top government officials' purchasing power to 1969 levels.
   For members of Congress, for example, that would put pay near
$135,000 _ roughly a 50 percent increase. Cabinet members and
Supreme Court justices, who now make $115,000, would presumably be
recommended for similar boosts.

   Major obstacles to an Iran-Contra trial of
Oliver L. North were removed when the judge in the case sharply
restricted the number of classified documents the former White House
aide may use for his defense.
   By deciding to bar as evidence more than 90 percent of the
classified documents North wanted to disclose, U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell greatly increased the chances that the case will
go to trial, possibly late next month.
   Gesell's ruling diminishes the possibility that President
Reagan's refusal to release virtually all the secrets sought by
North would force dismissal of charges on the ground that the former
National Security Council aide couldn't get a fair trial. The judge
harshly rebuked North for demanding ``disclosure of masses of
classified material which under no conceivable version of a defense
could have any utility whatsoever.''

paintings from a country museum.
   Monday night's theft from the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum

   The thieves gained entry by smashing a window in the sprawling,
single-floor building in the midst of a 25-acre national park near
the West German border, police said. No official valuation has been
disclosed for the three works, but ``The Potato Eaters'', a somber

   Arctic wolves live far from humans and have never
been hunted, so they don't know enough to run from someone with a
gun _ or a camera.
   Wildlife photographer Jim Brandenburg and wolf biologist David
Mech took advantage of the wolves' tolerance and occasional
curiosity during two years of observing them from a camp on
Ellesmere Island, Canada, less than 500 miles from the North Pole.
   The result was some rare and amazingly closeup footage of arctic
wolves for Brandenburg's National Geographic Explorer film, ``White
Wolf,'' premiering this Sunday on SuperStation TBS.
   Ellesmere Island is barren, so there was no way to hide from the
wolves. But the scruffy, white-coated critters were merely curious
about Brandenburg and Mech's tents and cameras and four-wheel
motorcycles.
   Their remote location keeps the wolves safe from persecution by
humans who in other areas of North America kill them for attacking
domestic stock and sometimes just for sport.
   Wolves live under something of a monarchy, and the king and queen
are the alpha male and female. At one point, the alpha female,
nicknamed ``Mom,'' came close enough to Mech that he could toss her
bits of his sandwich. She also allowed the men to come within a few
feet of her frisky pups.
   Though the wolves are magnificent to watch, not that much new
information is revealed by the film. Anyone who has read Farley
Mowat's best-selling ``Never Cry Wolf,'' or just seen the Disney
film adaptation, already knows wolves are not the slathering,
indiscriminate killers of lore, but highly intelligent creatures
with a well-developed social structure.
   Mech, we are told, has spent 30 years studying wolves. But when
he and Brandenburg stand over a tape machine listening to a
recording of the pack's howling, Mech remarks not-so-helpfully, ``I
wish I knew what it all meant.'' No doubt so does anyone who might
have supplied him with a research grant.
   But the men did figure out that a half bark was the wolf
equivalent of ``Back off, man!'' So when curious wolves invaded
their camp, they mimicked the bark and sent the pack high-tailing it
back to their den.
   Later, Mech went over a ridge and mimicked a strange wolf howling
in the distance, leaving Brandenburg to observe the pack's reaction.
Brandenburg reported to Mech that, hey, they howled back, then all
jumped around together in such a jumble, he couldn't really sort it
out. Your Aunt Martha could have observed as much.
   The narrative, read by Richard Kiley, is rather ploddingly
written and doesn't do justice to the film footage. Brandenburg is
more articulate with his camera.
   Even documentaries seem to need some kind of plot, so tension
builds as Brandenburg tries to film the pack hunting big game, in
this case, musk-oxen, great furry creatures that look like
overdressed buffalo.
   In one of Brandenburg's attempts to follow them, the wolf pack
crosses a river and leaves him behind. On another outing, he keeps
up with them, but they only sniff around a threesome of musk-oxen,
apparently deciding they are too formidable to take on.
   Finally, late in the film, Brandenburg gets his chance, and the
result is some stunning footage of the wolf pack working together to
bring down a hapless calf whose mother abandons it, giving literal
meaning to the term ``thrown to the wolves.'' As Brandenburg and
Mech note, the wolves they had gotten so familiar with back at the
den had turned into one finely tuned killing machine.
   Almost every aspect of the wolves' life was documented _ except
the five months of winter the humans couldn't endure. When
Brandenburg and Mech returned the following spring, three wolves had
died, probably of starvation or disease, and there was a new alpha
male.
   But ``Mom'' was still there. In an amazing feat of filmmaking,
Brandenburg took pictures of her new pups _ inside the den.
   ``These pictures are courtesy of an arctic wolf,'' says the
narration in a moment of eloquence. ``Can we return its trust?''
   Brandenburg's beautiful film is all most of us need ever see of
them, and with any luck, the sight of humans will become but a
memory to arctic wolves.

<HEAD>Beyond Harvard Yard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You may not ever go to Harvard but Harvard might
come to you, bit by bit, course by course, one professor at a time.
Right into your living room, classroom, conference room or board
room. On videotape.
   It won't be like strolling through Harvard Yard, because the
courses are offered by the Graduate School of Business
Administration, which is across the river in Boston. And many of the
scenes were shot at a dozen different sites.
   But it will be Harvard, as evidenced by the first production,
``Michael Porter on Competitive Strategy.'' Many business people
already know Porter as one of the Business School's brightest
lights, a professor there since 1973.
   In his Harvard videotape debut, Porter will have support from a
cast of top executives in American business, including John Pepper,
the rarely interviewed Procter & Gamble president, and Robert
Crandall, American Airlines chairman.
   The approach conceivably could be even more effective than the
classroom. Says Porter, ``It allows us to illustrate in a visceral,
tangible way how broad theoretical concepts have application in the
real world.''
   Benson Shapiro, professor of business administration, declares
the tapes are more than a lecture. ``They offer strategy in vivo,
dynamics in action, seeing as believing, understanding, and
absorbing.''
   John Nathan of Nathan@Tyler, a production company that joined
with Harvard to produce the tapes, is even more descriptive. He says
the impact is ``analagous to watching a botanist leave the lab, walk
through the rain forest, and turn over a leaf that contains evidence
in support of his theory.''
   Porter already is familiar to executives through his lectures,
his eight books, his articles, his interviews of them, his
first-hand advice to them on competition, and his frequent
professional testimony.
   The most widely acclaimed of his books gives an idea of his
influence. Published in 1980, ``Competitive Strategy: Techniques for
Analyzing Industries and Competitors,'' is in its 32nd printing and
is available in 14 languages.
   The idea for a series of Harvard Business School tapes began at
least four years ago, said Shapiro, who is also serves as the
Business School's senior associate dean for publications.
   The goal, he said, was to produce a series that would capture the
vitality of the Business School experience through development of
sophisticated material. Simple as that might sound, it posed big
technical problems.
   Those difficulties evaporated before the creative powers of
Porter, John Nathan and Sam Tyler. Nathan, an author and translator
as well, had produced several documentary business films for
television. He knew the procedure.
   In 1984, he and Tyler had created a company to produce and
distribute films and videocassette programs for business training
and executive education. They scored from the start: Their first
production was ``In Search of Excellence,'' a 90-minute film based
on the runaway best-selling book by Tom Peters.
   Porter's tape is the first of the Harvard Business School Video
Series jointly produced by the school and Nathan@Tyler. Two others
will follow in the next few months.
   The second in the series, ``Managing Information Technology as a
Competitive Weapon,'' features professors F. Warren McFarlan and
James I. Cash, Jr. The third is yet to be given a title.
   A Harvard education doesn't come for a song.
   Each program, consisting of two videocassettes totaling 2{ hours,
plus a manual, viewer's guide and printed materials, costs $1,000,
including shipping and handling. Add to that a 5 percent
Massachusetts state sales tax. Discounts of 20 percent are available
to degree-granting institutions of higher learning.
   If you still need to be convinced that a Harvard education is
worth your time and money you may obtain a 15-minute preview that
highlights the longer tapes. It costs $50, with the cost applicable
to purchase.
   For information, you can write to Harvard Business School Video
Series, Nathan@Tyler, 535 Boylston St., Boston, Mass. 02116.

   There's a moment in Clint Eastwood's movie,
``Bird,'' when the great jazzman Charlie Parker stands on a
blackened Paris stage after finishing a concert, consuming massive
doses of applause and sniffing a long-stemmed red rose.
   He was something of a god to jazz zealots, but perhaps the
tortured musical genius never really got a chance to wake up and
smell the roses. He mutilated his life with drugs and alcohol, and
died at the age of 34 in 1955.
   Eastwood, who has loved jazz since his childhood and who always
wanted to film a portrait of Parker, attempts to harness the Bird's
creative spirit and all the creative juices of that time _ a time
when bebop came to fore and brought jazz into the modern age. At the
same time, it pokes into the underbelly of the jazz world with its
stark portrayal of drugs, alcohol, debauchery.
   ``His life was obviously filled with many excesses _ sort of a
dichotomy,'' Eastwood says. ``How a person who can be so brilliant
and who spent hours and hours to become as great as he did and have
that kind of discipline could not in any other part of his life.
That was always a wonder to me.
   ``But I wanted a movie where you root for him. ... I just wanted
to explore the fact that he was brilliant and innovative, and the
other just became a part of his life.''
   Eastwood even films ``Bird'' in a dark, brownish hue. ,
   ``Most of the jazz world is nocturnal,'' he says. ``TV
unfortunately has shown a whole generation that flat light is the
only way. I don't like flat light. I like the feel of the movie; I
like to look into a film instead of having it look out at you. I
approached the color of it in terms of black and white.''
   Forest Whitaker (``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Platoon'') is
gentle yet fierce, playful yet obsessed in his role as Parker, for
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the Cannes Film
Festival. It was well deserved for a stunning performance that even
captures the hunched body stances once assumed by the musician as he
performed. As Chan Parker, Diane Venora (``Ironweed,'' ``F-X'')
finds the right balance between free spirit and strong, loving wife
who battles her husband's philandering and personal demons and at
the same time champions his work and well-being.
   
   ``Bird'' followed the success of last year's ``Round Midnight,''
the story of an expatriate sax player in Paris. Tenor saxophone
great Dexter Gordon, who once worked with Parker, received an
Academy Award nomination for his role as the tragic Dale Turner.
Though based loosely on the late jazz musician Bud Powell, Bertrand
Tavernier's movie is a universal story of jazz artists who fled
bigotry and rough times in America for the allure of Paris and
Amsterdam during the 1940s, '50s and '60s.
   ``Paris Blues,'' Martin Ritt's 1961 jazz movie starring Paul
Newman and Sidney Poitier, takes a more romantic, Hollywood
approach. The late Duke Ellington received an Oscar nomination for
his score.
   In ``Bird,'' Lenny Niehaus did the score, which isolates Parker's
original playing of ``Laura,'' ``April in Paris,'' ``Ornithology,''
``Parker's Mood'' and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist Ron Carter,
trumpeter John Faddis, pianists Walter Davis Jr. and Barry Harris.
Jazz purists have been rankled by the soundtrack, which they say is
technically excellent but misses the interplay between Parker and
his sidemen.
   But Eastwood defends his decision: ``If you're going to do a film
and have stereophonic sound, you need to record well. Charlie never
had the opportunity to do stereophonic sound.''
   Charlie Parker was born in Kansas City, and took up first
baritone and then alto sax while still in high school, which he left
at the age of 14 so he could study such greats as Lester Young and
Count Basie in the local clubs. He soon found himself in New York
where a young trumpet player named Dizzy Gillespie was all the rage.
   With Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell on piano, Kenny Clarke on
drums and later a young Miles Davis on trumpet, Parker and Gillespie
helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz _ bebop.
   Parker, whose nickname was Yardbird and shortened to Bird,
stumbled into the lost world of night life. But even with the
debiliation of drugs and alcohol, he never failed to solve musical
problems and invent new directions.
   ``There have been no great harmonic changes in jazz since Charlie
and Dizzy,'' Eastwood says.
   And then he muses, what musical levels would Parker have reached
today had he lived? ``It would be interesting,'' the actor-filmmaker
says.

   A 28-year-old woman in an exclusive

   ``My shotgun is my best protection against car-nappers,'' said

   Walden Carbonell, manager of the Walden-James Guns and Hobby
Shop, says business is booming. He said about 40 customers, most of
them businessmen and professionals, come into his shop every day.
   ``There are more criminals with guns nowadays,'' he told one
customer. ``That's why you need a sophisticated weapon.''
   The customer, lawyer Tomas Lahom, agreed.
   ``I'm buying a semi-automatic shotgun, just for the home,'' he
said.
   ``There has been an increase in the number of individuals wanting
to own firearms,'' said Col. Jose Andaya, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary's firearms and explosives unit. ``But this is normal
because of our peace and order situation.''
   Police report that in 1986, the most recent year for which
complete statistics are available, 21,914 crimes were reported in
metropolitan Manila. Of those, 14,281 were ``index crimes,'' such as
murder, rape, armed robbery and kidnapping.
   The police say they have no later figures that would show whether
the rate is rising or falling, but the general public perceives it
as rising. President Corazon Aquino said in September law and order
was breaking down and that preventing crime was a top government
priority.
   According to a study by private security companies, 764 murders
were reported up to October this yar and only 299 have been solved.
The study also said banks lost 55.3 million pesos ($2.7 million) in
nearly 50 armed holdups in that same period.
   Fascination with firearms has been a traditional feature of
Philippine life. But police acknowledge that the firearm fad is
increasing because of public fears about violent crime and lack of
confidence in law enforcement.
   ``There is a most compelling felt need among a growing number of
Filipinos to arm themselves,'' said the Philippine Daily Inquirer
newspaper. ``The average Filipino does not have enough confidence in
the authorities to defend him from physical harm.''
   Several Manila newspapers have decried the spread of firearms
among the public, maintaining that the increase in weapons will only
make the city more dangerous.
   ``More firearms in the hands of civilians will not combat
criminality,'' said The Manila Chronicle. ``All government has to do
is strictly enforce the ban on carrying of firearms by unauthorized
persons.''
   But in October, the Philippine Congress actually made it easier
for Filipinos without criminal records to obtain weapons. It
approved a bill allowing individuals to own as many as two licensed
firearms and to carry one of them outside a residence.
   Congress itself has imported weapons for the protection of its
members, and carloads of armed security guards trailing limousines
of congressmen, government officials or prosperous businessmen are a
common sight on Manila streets.
   In 1986, Customs intercepted a cargo of firearms, including
Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns, but released the shipment when it
turned out the weapons were imported by the office of Vice President
Salvador Laurel.

<HEAD>Shiites Bring Islamic Fundamentalism to Lebanon's Ancient Baalbek</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scantily dressed dancers are long
gone. The last liquor store was blown up six years ago. This ancient
Roman city now is the capital in Lebanon of Shiite Moslem
fundamentalism.
   Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief
male-female unions called pleasure marriages are condoned.
   On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the
dictates of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic
fundamentalism in Iran, which to Western eyes appears joyless and
forbidding.
   Wearing make-up or jewelery in public is taboo. So is singing and
dancing at mixed gatherings, because as one woman noted, ``it causes
psychological imbalance and tempts men.''
   But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black
robe-like chadors Shiite women have to wear in public are discarded
in favor of shorts and strapless tops, along with make-up and
perfume.
   ``People think we're made of stone just because we cover
ourselves with chadors. But we're not. We're ready to do anything to
please our husbands,'' said Selma, a housewife.
   Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a
cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in
the breathtaking Roman amphitheaters.
   Now the ruins echo to Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists
stage political rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of
``Death to America! Death to Israel!'' The amphitheaters have also
been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's sectarian fighting.
   The Shiites' strict lifestyle has drawn bitter criticism from
many Lebanese, Moslems and Christians alike, who say that the
fundamentalists' ``double standards'' has brought Islam into
disrepute.
   Most Shiites in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which
is believed to be an umbrella for Shiite kidnappers holding most of
the 16 foreigners missing in Lebanon. It's made up of zealots
blindly loyal to Khomeini.
   ``We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we
reject,'' said Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's
``haouzeh,'' or religious center, in Baalbek.
   The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs
frowned on by other Lebanese, especially moderate Shiites and Sunnis.
   In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a
curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited
number of lovers in the name of religion.
   But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are
considered respectable and far from promiscuous.
   The practice is widespread in Iran, where overwhelming majority
of the 54 million population is Shiite.
   Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage,
making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period
which could last ``for an hour, two days, a month, or as long as
they desire.''
   ``It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child
born after the marriage contract expires,'' she explained.
   She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's
economic crisis because ``men cannot afford a regular marriage, and
let's face it, they have physical needs.
   ``If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure
marriage provides the outlet,'' she added. ``It's much better than
doing it illicitly.''
   No cleric is required to perform the cermony. The woman, who
should preferably be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, ``I
give myself to you in pleasure.''
   He responds: ``I accept.'' And that's it.
   Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not
seek it.
   As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit
classical music ``because it does not have any negative
psychological effects,'' Nasser said.
   She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is
bad for ``the nerves and the blood circulation.''
   Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has
collapsed, the Shiites have established their own medical and
welfare systems, amply funded by Iran.
   Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, told The Associated Press:
``Social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of
the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon.
   ``We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here which provides
free medical treatment. There are similar centers in other Shiite
areas.''
   He noted: ``We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small
profit, as well as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000
students in the near future.
   ``We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills
to provide wells in remote villages, especially those we consider
have military or political importance.''
   Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and night
clubs, Mousavi noted: ``We're not imposing Islamic values on people.
No one can say we've raided houses where people gamble or drink.''
   Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded:
``There were incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal
after witnessing aberrant behavior. But Hezbollah is against that.''

<HEAD>Hoffman Studies Huntington Autistic for Role in `Rain Man'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Rain Man, b0446</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To help prepare for his ``Rain Man''
role of Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man whisked from the
institution where he's spent his life, Dustin Hoffman studied an
autistic West Virginia man who lives outside institutional walls,
thanks to support from his mother and hometown.
   Hoffman was ``introduced'' to Joseph Sullivan, a 28-year-old
Huntington man, at the UCLA Behavioral Sciences Media Lab. There he
watched two documentaries that described Sullivan's life, along with
16 hours of outtakes from one of them, the 1986 documentary
``Portrait of an Autistic Young Man.'' ``That's where I met Joe, in
a sense. That was my kickoff. I buried myself there for the first
two months,'' Hoffman said last weekend at a local showing of ``Rain
Man'' to benefit the Autism Services Center, run by Sullivan's
mother, Ruth.
   Hoffman finally met Sullivan face-to-face in Cincinnati while
filming ``Rain Man.''
   ``We just made a film that's going to play for, you know, a month
or two, or whatever, in cities around America and around the world
and be put out on cassette and put on shelves and seen once,''
Hoffman told Huntington residents at the screening.
   ``You people have Joe in your community for the rest of your
lives, and I would take that any day of the week. ... He is a very
special person who shines through this ... magic he has.''
   No one is sure what causes autism, which makes some victims
catatonic, some self-destructive, some uncommunicative. Some
scientists believe it's caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.
   Dr. Daniel Hubert, a UCLA associate clinical professor of
psychiatry and principal writer and producer at the media lab, said
his role is to help victims how to function in society.
   ``What we try to do is control chronic problems ... and teach
them to lead reasonable normal lives,'' Hubert said. ``We try to
help them avoid being institutionalized, self-destructive or being
left vulnerable.''
   Those criteria make Sullivan a success.
   ``I was impressed that this guy wasn't institutionalized,''
Hubert said of Sullivan. ``For a kid who started where he started
from, he was able to do things that weren't expected of him.''
   Sullivan has perfect pitch and excels at math, common traits in
autistics. He can, for example, come up with the square root of a
number such as 4,555 in his head in just a few seconds.
   Sullivan graduated from Huntington High School in 1981. He was
taught through the special education program but took regular math
and science courses.
   Everyone at Huntington High knew Joe Sullivan, but nobody really
knew him, said his teacher, Melanie Butler. Some students remained
abusive toward him and few understood that in many ways he was like
them.
   ``He would go up to girls and say, `I'm going to touch your
breasts.' All he wanted was for them to become hysterical _ like
little boys putting frogs down a girl's dress,'' Butler said.
   ``I told him once, `Go ahead, if you can find them.' He said,
`No.' He was crestfallen, and he never did it again.''
   Sullivan now works at the Cabell County Public Library. Butler
said she would like to see him move on eventually, to experience a
wider slice of life. ``He's still growing and changing,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sullivan, upon learning in 1962 that her 2-year-old son was
autistic, committed her life to learning more about the condition.
She has fought for funding and understanding.
   ``Doors are just becoming open for autistic people,'' she said.
``There's lots of mystery, and what's not mystery is
misinformation.''

<TEXT>
   In Oaxaca the state government created a Department of Religious
Cults to mediate religious conflicts among the Indians. It consists
of one person, Jesus Angel Martinez Oceguera.
   Martinez pulls out a thick folder stuffed with accords he has
negotiated in some of Oaxaca's most isolated Mixe, Mixtec and
Zapotec Indian communities. Many are signed with the thumbprints of
people who cannot read and write.
   In the Mixe village of Chuxnaban, for example, authorities agreed
to stop fining Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to help pay for
religious festivals. The Witnesses agreed to help pay for public
works projects instead.
   In the Zapotec town of San Franciso Yatee, Protestants and
Catholics agreed to end Sunday loudspeaker wars.
   But the Rev. Benjamin Hernandez, spokesman for an alliance of
more than 30 Protestant faiths in Oaxaca, said Catholic officials
have refused to discuss the exile problem with his group.
   At Easter, Archbishop Bartoleme Carrasco of Oaxaca wrote that his
diocese ``has been battered by Protestant sects, principally
fundamentalists and fanatic anti-Catholics.''
   In a recent interview, the diocese spokesman, the Rev. Daniel
Quiroga, called the exile problem a religious war. He accused some
Protestant missionaries of wooing converts with food, clothing and
medical care, a charge Marroquin said was not justified.
   ``These people do not sell their faith for a little money,'' said
Marroquin.
   Converts are often individuals in crisis living in societies in
crisis, Hernandez said.
   ``I was a drunk,'' Francisco Ramirez Nicolas, a Triqui Indian who
belongs to the Cleveland-based Church of God of the New Testament,
said when asked why he converted.
   Other converts wanted a more direct, personal involvement than
their old religion offered. They welcomed the chance to become lay
ministers, relished studying the Bible. It was an intellectual
adventure for many bright people whose horizons had been clouded.
   Abraham Sanchez Bautista, a Triqui, said he converted after
joining a Protestant Bible study group. The Catholic priests in his
village, he said, ``never talked to us. They never taught us.''
   Quiroga claimed that Protestants are a divisive force in Indian
communal life, saying they reject local customs and often preach
foreign, materialistic ideas. Some, he said, exhort their adherents
to reject the Mexican flag and the national anthem.
   ``The Spanish conquest committed great injustices, not just
against property but also against cultural values,'' Quiroga said.
``The indigenous people suffered great abuse. Now, once again, some
sects are trampling on the unity of those communities.''
   Quiroga said the Catholic church does not condone the expulsions,
but it can't stop them. ``The Indians are not as docile as they used
to be,'' he said.
   Lopez Mendez of Chamula said pluralism is the path to extinction.
   ``In Chamula we don't permit other customs,'' he said. ``If we
did, all the old ways would be thrown away.''

<HEAD>Thousands of Acres of Crops Shrivel in Historic Dry Spell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For farmers across America, 1988 was a 3-D year: drought,
destruction and despair.
   The nation suffered through one of the worst dry spells in a
half-century, since the days of the Dust Bowl, as sunny skies
created clouds of doom for thousands of farmers who watched their
crops and hopes shrivel in blistering triple-digit heat.
   It was a year when farmers prayed and Indians danced for rain,
when the mighty Mississippi stopped its easy rolling and crop seeds
started blowing, when the country sizzled while the Fourth of July
fizzled because fireworks celebrations were canceled for fear of
igniting grass fires.
   But the drought brought prosperity, too _ for rail carriers whose
business picked up when barge traffic slowed down, for auction
houses flooded with livestock because ranchers were short on feed,
and for farmers lucky enough to have surpluses or to live in areas
blessed with rain.
   In fact, although losses climbed into the billions of dollars and
thousands of acres of crops were lost, the drought was not the total
disaster some had feared.
   ``Prices were up. We had some of last year's crop in the bin to
sell,'' said Jim Nichols, Minnesota's agriculture commissioner.
``That's what saved us. ... It didn't have to anything to do with
the crop we harvested this year.''
   And with billions of dollars of federal aid and late rains,
``most farmers have fared much better than they would have
otherwise,'' said Jim Vertrees, an Agriculture Department economist.
   But ``that's not to say farmers aren't hurting,'' he added. Corn
production fell by 34 percent from last year's bumper crop, while
soybeans dropped 21 percent and spring wheat 54 percent, Vertrees
said.
   The Council of Economic Advisers has estimated crop losses at
about $13 billion in 1982 prices, Vertrees said.
   Despite those gloomy numbers, the Agriculture Department, citing
higher commodity prices, inventory and only moderate drops in
government subsidies, has predicted net cash income _ the amount of
money farmers have to spend during the year _ to be close to 1987's
record $57.1 billion.
   But many states were hit hard. In sparsely populated North
Dakota, for example, the estimated total loss, including the impact
on non-agricultural business dependent on the farm economy, is a
whopping $2.2 billion, even with federal aid, said Arlen Leholm, a
North Dakota State University extension economist.
   And Leholm noted the drought came at a time when many farmers
were just digging out from the agricultural crisis of the early
1980s. Land prices were climbing slowly. Livestock prices were up.
   ``There was a general feeling of optimism,'' he said. ``They had
feelings of euphoria. (They felt) maybe I can see the light at the
end of the tunnel. Then it turned out to be a train.''
   From May through July _ the critical growing season _
precipitation was at record lows in seven states from Montana to
Mississippi and at its second-lowest levels ever in six other
states, from Georgia to North Dakota.
   Signs of trouble surfaced early. In May, ranchers in the parched
Texas prairies were burning thorns off prickly cactuses to feed to
cattle. From San Francisco to Atlanta, residents were asked to
reduce water consumption.
   ``It reached different people at different times,'' said Neil
Harl, an economics professor at Iowa State University. ``It became
increasingly clear as temperatures started to rise by early June, we
had a serious problem.''
   Heat records fell in city after city, aggravating the bone-dry
conditions. Water levels shrunk. By June, more than a thousand
barges were stranded in the shrunken Mississippi, wind erosion had
damaged millions of acres in the Great Plains, fish were dying in
Wisconsin streams and wells were drained in Nebraska.
   As summer began, anxious farmers fought to keep their animals
from starving and watched their normally knee-high corn stunted at
ankle-level.
   Although rain fell in some spots, hints of relief didn't come
until August, when President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought
aid package that provides disaster payments to those who harvested
less than 65 percent of their normal production.
   It was one of two silver linings. ``We were not anticipating
Congress would be as generous or that crops would be as resilient as
they were,'' Harl said.
   Farmers also benefited from an additional $3 billion in emergency
aid _ feed assistance and crop insurance _ and relaxed standards
that allowed haying or grazing on land normally exempt from such
uses.
   By fall, the Farmers Home Administration also had declared 1,489
counties eligible for emergency disaster loans, including 13 entire
states, Vertrees said.
   Still, it was a bitter harvest for farmers facing another season
with little moisture in the ground and less grain in the bin.
   ``We're in a situation where it's going to take above average
rainfalls to have an average crop,'' said Bruce Bullock, an
agricultural economist at the University of Missouri. ``It's a
little premature to say the drought is totally behind us.''

<HEAD>Summer of Wildfire, About-Face on `Let It Burn' Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAD BARTIMUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relentless sunshine,
smoke-choked days and sleepless nights finally convinced the
stewards of some of America's most precious public land to make a
judgment call last summer that will be debated for years: Fight all
fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   The established wildfire management plan had called for
suppressing forest fires caused by man, but allowing those touched
off by lightning or other natural causes to burn on, as long as they
didn't threaten life, property, or historic sites.
   By mid-July, however, fires were burning in almost every corner
of the park. Worse, the usual summer rains hadn't come and millions
of lodgepole pine trees, killed by bettles, were just waiting for an
airborne spark.
   ``Everybody concluded we were into some unprecedented conditions
and each and every fire had to be fought aggressively,'' said park
spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   Did that decision mean too little and come too late?
   Congressional hearings, internal reviews and public oversight
panels are trying to find out whether bad policy and bureaucratic
mismanagement needlessly allowed almost half of America's first
national park to burn, or whether park officials acted as
aggressively and responsibly as humanly possible in the face of
nature's fury.
   ``By anybody's reckoning these fires are a catastrophe,'' said
Yellowstone Superintendent Bob Barbee, but ``I just despair at this
`They should have known' attitude. There was no way to anticipate
this. It's never happened before.''
   Some Western politicians called for dismissal of the National
Park Service director, William Penn Mott. Their calls went unheeded,
but the rhetoric ignited almost as much heat for park managers as
the fires themselves.
   When heavy winter snows finally smothered the flames in
mid-November, park officials tallied preliminary numbers from
Yellowstone's record-breaking summer of fire (figures that do not
include fire costs in six surrounding national forests):
   _706,278 acres of the 2.2-million-acre park burned.
   _29 buildings destroyed, including 20 at the Old Faithful
complex, an estimated loss of $800,000.
   _25,000 firefighters mustered from around the nation to fight the
dozen blazes, including 5,595 Army and Marine troops.
   _At least $115 million spent on mostly futile firefighting
efforts.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates logistical
support for all wildfires throughout the country, reported that more
than 30,000 firefighters battled 72,000 blazes that charred more
than 5 million acres in the United States this year, including 2.2
million acres in Alaska.
   It was the worst year for wildfires since 1926, when an estimated
28 million acres burned.
   Heroic efforts saved the priceless Old Faithful Inn, the massive
wooden landmark in front of the geyser that still, fire or no fire,
erupts on schedule about every 75 minutes.
   But thousands of acres of the nation's ``mother park'' are black
and dead. The economies of surrounding tourist towns in three states
were severely undercut by the fires, and civic leaders worry
tourists will stay away because of bad publicity. There are also
fears that Yellowstone's famous animals _ the grizzly bears, bison
and elk _ will face serious food shortages.
   Only the scientists so far have found a silver lining: They say
Yellowstone now offers the most important wildfire research
opportunity in history.

<HEAD>1988 Was Beginning of End of U.S. Support for Nicaraguan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seven years, tens of thousands of lost
lives and almost $300 million in spending, the United States is
looking for a way out of President Reagan's Contra policy in
Nicaragua.
   Although President-elect George Bush's policy on the Nicaraguan
rebels remains short on detail, Contra opponents and supporters
alike agree that 1988 probably will be viewed as the beginning of
the end for the anti-Sandinista insurgents.
   ``Nineteen eighty-eight was a year in which the policy ...
essentially ended, because the Contras by the end of the year had
become a non-factor,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who led
the losing fight in the House of Representatives to continue
military aid for the Contras.
   ``Basically, the war has come to a halt,'' said Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., a leader of anti-Contra forces in the House.
   The rebels, who began the year with as many as 16,000 fighters
launching attacks inside Nicaragua, ended it with most of their
forces huddled under makeshift black plastic shelters in camps along
the Honduran border.
   Throughout his presidency, Reagan made the Contras a top
foreign-policy priority.
   Critics said the president's romantic fervor for those he equated
with America's founding fathers, and his fear of Soviet influence in
the region, blinded him to Latin America's larger economic problems
and locked the United States into a no-win policy.
   But Reagan's supporters said military force was the only way to
move the Sandinistas toward fulfilling promises of democratization
made to the Organization of American States after they took power in
1979.
   After years of military aid to the rebels, both covert and overt,
the House voted narrowly Feb. 3 to cut off the flow of weapons,
heeding the call of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez and
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, to ``give peace a chance.''
   The Contras' last military support ran out Feb. 29, and no direct
U.S. weapons aid has flowed since.
   The Democrats, not wanting to be seen as abandoning the rebels
entirely, later approved $75 million in ``humanitarian'' aid for the
Contras _ food, medicine and shelter.
   A shaky cease-fire took effect in 1988 in the Sandinista-Contra
war. Estimates now are that some 10,000 rebel troops, unable to
mount an offensive but unwilling to disband, remain encamped just
inside Honduras, with as many as 30,000 family members.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, a champion of Contra
aid, contends that the withdrawal of U.S. military aid from the
Contras has emboldened the Sandinistas.
   ``There is more repression (in Nicaragua), more subversion in El
Salvador, essentially undiminished Soviet aid levels,'' Abrams said.
He says the only solution is to revive the rebel resistance to the
Nicaraguan government.
   But few of Washington's key actors still share Abrams' hard-line
stance. Bush's designated secretary of state, James Baker, known as
a pragmatist, is unlikely to begin his relationship with Congress
with a surefire confrontation. And the new House elected in November
will be slightly more anti-Contra than the last.
   Something will have to be done by April 1, when the last of the
non-lethal aid to the rebels expires.

<HEAD>Wisdom of Whale Decision Still Debated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE BARTLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe the local food was too good. Or
maybe they were too young to know better. For whatever reason, in
mid-October three malingering whales became trapped in Alaska's
arctic ice _ and caught in the camera eye of the world.
   Roy Ahmaogak was the first to spot the three California gray
whales, ringed by encroachin on Alaska's northern
coast.
   The Eskimo whaling captain could have gone for the easy kill. But
he wanted to help fill Barrow's whale quota with bowheads, larger
animalsg ice off Barrow. He passed the grays by.
   His hunting instincts told him, however, it wasn't right to let
them suffer. He sought advice from his fellow whalers, and they
sought the advice of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Ron Morris, a service biologist, was in Barrow discussing the
matter with the Eskimos when he learned that the key decision had
already been made. Word came from Washington that he should do
everything possible to save the whales.
   The two-week rescue effort that followed captured the world's
imagination, and cost more than $1 million.
   Day after day, rescuers tried untested techniques for freeing the
20,000-pound animals. Finally, the combined efforts of the Eskimos,
U.S. government agenciesdio
warnings, and it gave no indication it was not hostile _ ``so our
grief and despair are tempered by the knowledge we did what we had
to do when we had to do it,'' Rogers said.
   The Navy board of inquiry agreed.
   ``The USS Vincennes did not purposely shoot down an Iranian
commercial airliner. Rather, it engaged an aircraft the commanding
officer ... believed to be hostile and a threat to his ship.''
   The Navy report also said, however, that the ``fog of war,'' the
stress of combat and the unconscious distortion of data by the
Vincennes crew may have played a major role in the incident.
   An investigatory panel of the International Civil Aviation
Organization found the Navy culpable, saying U.S. warships in the
Gulf should have been aware of and monitoring such scheduled
commercial air traffic.
   Little more than a month after the accident, Iran and Iraq would
begin a cease-fire that was still holding months later, ending eight
years of bloody warfare on land and at sea. Oil tankers could
transit the Gulf without any need for U.S. escort.
   Ironically, some American analysts concluded that the loss of
Flight 655 contributed to Iran's acceptance of the truce,
dramatizing to that nation's leaders that they could neither defeat
Iraq nor force the U.S. Navy out of the GUlf, and that civilians
would increasingly bear the consequences.
   Within the Navy, the tragedy produced plans for some changes in
training and minor equipment alterations. The Navy also added
equipment for monitoring civilian air traffic.
   But by refusing to take disciplinary action against Rogers or his
crew, the Pentagon also underscored its willingness to back up any
skipper as long as he didn't make the mistake of the USS Stark
commander in May 1987 and take the first hit.
   ``The orders given to all skippers entering the Persian Gulf made
clear that there should be no repeat'' of the Stark incident, in
which that frigate was hit by two missiles fired by an Iraqi jet,
says Rep. Les Aspen, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee.
   ``We all know that what Captain Rogers did was in error. The
tragedy is that, through the weight of the evidence, a decision to
shoot was logical.''

   Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs to
plant closings and layoffs from 1983 to 1988, the government said.
   Nearly 4.7 million of the 9.7 million laid off during the 5-year
period were ``tenured'' workers, meaning they lost jobs they had
held for three years or more, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   Seven out of ten of those workers had new jobs as of January this

<HEAD>Heating, Crude Oil Rise on Cold Weather</HEAD>

   The abrupt arrival of sub-zero temperatures in
the Northeast gave a boost to heating and crude oil futures.
   ``The cold weather news did give heating oil a good lead,'' Bob
Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
Monday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
wholesale heating oil settled at 50.20 cents a gallon, up 0.70 cent,
after having risen 1.42 cents on Friday.
   The blast of arctic air _ which set low-temperature records in
some areas _ also lent support to crude oil futures, analysts said.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, settled at $16.06 a 42-gallon barrel, up 22
cents from Friday, when it gained 40 cents.
   It was the first time crude prices have closed above $16 since
OPEC members reached a new production agreement late last month.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed a new
agreement in November setting a daily production quota of 18.5
million barrels and a benchmark price of $18 a barrel. The new
agreement, which would lower the cartel's production from more than
22 million barrels, is to go into effect Jan. 1.
   Analysts said volume was thin in one of the quietest sessions in
months.
   ``Prices should hold firm until we get more news, or hear more
from OPEC about how much they're producing or if they're cheating,
and we won't know for another month,'' said Dave Kaplan, manager of
energy options for Elders Futures Inc.
   January unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.53 cents on Friday,
fell 0.26 to 44.20 cents a gallon Monday.
   Analysts said gasoline stocks have risen in the last few weeks
and investors expect to see a bigger increase on Tuesday when the
American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly statistics on
energy supplies.

<HEAD>Investor Group Makes $760 Million Offer For Chemical Company; Stock
Jumps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Securities analysts say a takeover brawl may be
brewing for Pennwalt Corp., a diversified chemical maker that
received a $760 million offer by a pair of financiers who have been
eying the company for months.
   Pennwalt stock surged $14.75 a share to close at $98 in New York
Stock Exchange trading Monday after the investment partnership
Centaur Partners said it would pay $100 a share cash for the 87.3
percent of the company it doesn't own.
   Company officials declined to comment on the tender offer from
Centaur Partners, which came in the midst of a major restructuring
of Pennwalt that was aimed partly at thwarting unwelcome acquirers.
   But Wall Street strategists who follow the Philadelphia-based
company said there was plenty of room for the bidding to go higher,
perhaps attracting rival offers.
   ``I think the company's going to fight it tooth and nail,'' said
Donald A. Pattison, a securities analyst for Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.
in New York. ``This is not going to be over next week.''
   Centaur principals Abbey J. Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin said in a
letter to the company's chairman and chief executive Edwin E. Tuttle
that they had all the financing needed to complete the deal and were
prepared to negotiate all aspects of their offer, including price.
   ``We believe that our offer represents a fair price and is in the
best interest of Pennwalt's shareholders,'' they stated in the
letter.
   But in a signal that the bidders expected a fight, they sued
Pennwalt in Philadelphia federal court to block its so-called poison
pill shareholders rights takeover defense, which Pennwalt and many
other companies have adopted to thwart unwelcome bids.
   Pennwalt manufactures and markets industrial chemicals used in a
range of products, from swimming pool chlorine to the chemical odor
in natural gas that alerts consumers to leaks. It has 9,000
employees and annual sales exceeding $1 billion.
   Pennwalt also is a leading maker of chlorinated plastic, commonly
used in building cable insulation, and has operations in mineral and
petroleum processing and industrial equipment.
   The size of the Pennwalt takeover offer isn't large when measured
against the multi-billion-dollar bidding wars that have shaped 1988
into the year of unprecedented megadeals.
   Nevertheless, Pennwalt's vulnerability to a takeover typifies the
predicament many diversified industrial companies are facing,
because their operations in many cases are worth more individually
than the company is as a whole.
   By some estimates, Pennwalt's so-called ``bustup value'' is
approximately $120 a share, or more than $900 million.
   Speculation about Pennwalt as a possible takeover target has
persisted since July, when Centaur Partners disclosed it had a 6.5
percent stake that it subsequently doubled.
   The company's management responded by undertaking a major
restructuring that so far has resulted in the sale of its
pharmaceutical business, maker of items such as Desenex foot powder
and Allerest allergy medicine.
   The proceeds of the $460 million sale to Fisons PLC of Britain
were used to help repurchase nearly 40 percent of Pennwalt's
outstanding shares.
   Although those moves boosted the price of the remaining stock,
they evidently weren't sufficient for Centaur principals Butler and
Estrin, who have been financial partners for years and have dabbled
in other takeover investments before.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Expecting Grand Met To Sweeten Bid Further</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even though Grand Metropolitan PLC says
it has made its ``last and best'' offer to buy Pillsbury Co.,
officials of the food and restaurant giant are expecting the bid to
be sweetened again.
   But for that to happen, Pillsbury's cornerstone ``poison pill''
defense must be left intact, lawyers for the Minneapolis-based
company said Monday in response to legal attacks against the pill by
Grand Met and dissident Pillsbury shareholders.
   The British liquor, hotel, retailing and gambling conglomerate
challenged the pill for the second time before Justice William Duffy
in the Delaware Chancery Court. Duffy, who earlier ruled in favor of
Pillsbury, a Delaware corporation, took the case under advisement
and did not say when he would make a decision.
   Pillsbury lawyer Steven Rothschild said Duffy's original decision
to uphold the pill benefited Pillsbury shareholders because Grand
Met on Monday raised its all-cash tender offer to $63 a share, or
$5.5 billion, up from $60 a share, or $5.23 billion.
   Pillsbury's board of directors called the sweetened bid
inadequate and recommended shareholders hold on to their stock. The
offer is set to expire Dec. 23.
   Pillsbury stock jumped $3.87{ higher to $62.12{ a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The court respectfully should let things run their course,''
Rothschild said in a courtroom crowded with Wall Street arbitrage
experts and other spectators. ``We're in a very fluid situation.
   ``The pill is serving its function,'' Rothschild said. ``They
know it makes economic sense for them to further increase their
offer.''
   But Robert Rifkind, a lawyer for Grand Met, said he had been told
by the company that $63 a share was its ``last and best'' tender
offer.
   Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard, in weekend meetings with
Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith, offered to buy the company for $65
a share on friendly terms, but the offer was rejected. Stuart Gold,
a lawyer for Grand Met, said the higher offer would only stand for a
friendly deal because it would eliminate costs related to the
takeover fight.
   Grand Met conditioned both tender offers on the removal of the
pill, or shareholders' rights plan, which it has said would make a
takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Grand Met also is seeking to block Pillsbury's proposed spinoff
of its Burger King subsidiary, which Gold said would add as much as
$8 a share in tax expenses to the cost of a takeover.
   Partly because Pillsbury has not offered an alternative to the
$63 tender offer of equal, immediate value, the pill should be
removed to give Grand Met control, Rifkind said.
   ``Shareholders have a fundamental right to sell their shares to
whomever they please, whenever they want,'' Rifkind said. ``If they
(Pillsbury) can merely label it (the offer) as inadequate and that
is allowed to sustain the poison pill, there will be no more tender
offers.''
   ``Shareholders will have lost a fundamental right to sell their
shares to the highest bidder,'' Rifkind said.
   The best Pillsbury has been able to offer shareholders is a vague
recapitalization program that its advisers say could improve the
company's value to the range of $68 to $73 a share, Rifkind and Gold
said.
   And those projections are based on a 5-year plan to spin off
Burger King and have it sold in addition to selling Pillsbury in a
few years, Rifkind said.
   ``They're talking about the distant future at best,'' Rifkind
said. ``What they are not offering shareholders is a trading value
anything like the Grand Met offer.''
   Gold said the valuations of up to $73 a share for Pillsbury are
based on ``super-aggressive projections'' that are ``wildly
optimistic'' about management's ability to turn the faltering
company around.
   ``Their refusal to redeem the pill is sort of the nuclear weapon
in the arsenal of the board,'' said Rifkind, who said there is no
threat to merit its use.
   Grand Met's lawyers repeatedly noted that 87.4 percent of
outstanding Pillsbury shares had been tendered to Grand Met and not
withdrawn as of Friday.
   But Rothschild said the percentage is high because Grand Met's
offer is ``coercive.'' Shareholders fear they will be left out of
the deal if they do not tender their shares even though Grand Met
has said the offer would be extended to those who don't, Rothschild
said.
   He said there are circumstances under which Grand Met would not
be obligated to pay the offered price to shareholders who don't
tender.
   Rifkind said Duffy should block the Burger King spinoff, which
has a record date of Dec. 19, for the same reason he should
invalidate the pill because the spinoff would amount to a ``poison
tax.''
   Under the proposed spinoff, Pillsbury shareholders would be
issued stock in a newly separate Burger King, which would borrow
money to issue a special dividend.
   Rothschild said Grand Met could prevent the spinoff of Burger
King by offering a fair price for Pillsbury.
   ``If Grand Met doesn't want to step up to the plate with a higher
offer before this date arrives,'' Rothschild said, ``then that's a
business decision they have to make.
   ``Grand Met must recognize and it better recognize that only the
surface of our negotiating skills have been scratched,'' Rothschild
said. ``Let Mr. Sheppard make no mistake about it: He's not going to
buy Pillsbury on the cheap.''

<HEAD>Forecaster Expects 6.1 Percent Ad Spending Growth in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional post-Olympic slump and weakness
in local advertising spending are being blamed as projections for
1989 point to the slowest growth in domestic ad spending in 14 years.
   ``It will be a rather mediocre year,'' Robert J. Coen, senior
vice president and director of forecasting for the advertising
agency McCann-Erickson, said Monday in projecting 6.1 percent ad
spending growth next year.
   He warned that the underlying sluggish trend could ``even become
worse if the economy falters and drifts into a recession.''
   The 6.1 percent growth to $125.6 billion in 1989 would be down
from the 7.9 percent rise Coen expects this year and it would be the
slowest growth since a 4.8 percent rate of increase in 1975.
   A decline in ad spending growth is typical in the year after the
Olympics and a presidential election, both of which are believed to
attract extra money into advertising.
   In post-Olympic years, the dropoff in national ad spending has
sometimes been cushioned by local ad growth. But growth in the local
category is also expected to suffer this time around, Coen said.
   Coen said he expects national ad spending will rise 6.5 percent
next year, while local spending will be up 5.6 percent. National ad
spending rose an estimated 8.9 percent this year, while local ad
spending rose about 6.7 percent.
   He said 1989 will also be the first time since 1975 that ad
spending failed to exceed the expected 6.8 percent growth including
inflation that many economists forecast for the economy next year.
   Meanwhile, foreign ad spending was projected to exceed U.S. ad
spending for the first time this year and is expected to widen its
lead next year.
   Coen said foreign ad spending grew 18 percent to about $121.4
billion in 1988, compared with spending of $118.3 billion in the
United States.
   Next year, he said while U.S. ad spending rises to $125.6
billion, foreign ad spending should rise 12 percent to $136 billion.
   In the U.S. market, Coen blamed the sluggish pace of local ad
spending growth on ``turmoil in retail marketing'' partly to recent
acquisitions and restructuring in the retail business. He said the
activity has left less money available for spending on local
advertising.
   He also said the volume of classified advertising in newspapers
appears to have flattened out after several years of rapid growth.
He cited a decline in real estate activity due to higher mortgage
rates and slower growth in help-wanted advertising.
   He expects local ad spending will reach $55.3 billion next year.
   Coen said he expects 1989 spending on the national broadcast
media will rise 4.5 percent to $21.2 billion, national print
spending will be up 5.8 percent to $10.2 billion and other national
ad spending such as the fast-growing direct mail will be up 7.8
percent to $38.9 billion.
   Spending on network television will be flat because of the
absence of an estimated $1 billion in spending related to the
Olympics, but cable and syndicated television should have
double-digit gains again, Coen said.
   National ad spending in newspapers should be flat, while spending
in magazines may fall back, particularly if automotive and toiletry
sectors scale back the growth in their ad spending.
   Coen was more optimistic about his longer-term outlook for ad
spending.
   ``The correction in over-expanded ad spending of the early 1980s
has been completed and most budgets are back in line with other
operating costs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shamrock Amends Offer for Polaroid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Disney-held company seeking to acquire Polaroid
Corp. has amended its takeover offer to meet a federal court order
that had blocked the $2.6 billion bid from going forward.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. said Monday its hostile $42-a-share bid
for the instant camera pioneer was now contingent on whether a judge
in Delaware invalidates or rescinds Polaroid's controversial
employee stock ownership plan.
   Analysts said the move would not dramatically alter Shamrock's
tender offer, which has been in abeyance pending court action.
   In Delaware, U.S. District Judge Caleb Wright on Monday ordered
Shamrock to modify the language of the offer and issue a news
release on the changes. The Burbank, Calif.-based television
company, wholly-owned by the Roy E. Disney family, met the
conditions immediately.
   Shamrock said it would purchase Polaroid shares under the
$42-a-share offer only if the employee stock plan is invalidated by
the Delaware Chancery Court, where Shamrock is challenging the plan.
   Previously, Shamrock had maintained that the deal could have
proceeded merely if the 10 million shares in the stock plan were
ruled not part of the company's outstanding shares.
   If the $300 million employee stock plan is invalidated, Shamrock
would try to buy 62 million outstanding shares. If not, it would be
faced with acquiring about 72 million shares under an earlier
$40-a-share offer, analysts said.
   Shamrock currently owns 5 million shares of Polaroid.
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said the company had no
comment on the development.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia last month
ordered the district court to issue a preliminary injunction
blocking the takeover bid until Shamrock clarified its position on
the employee stock plan.
   The plan places 14 percent of Polaroid stock in employee hands, a
move Shamrock claims was designed intentionally to defend against
its hostile takeover bid. Under Delaware law, a hostile bidder must
acquire at least 85 percent of a company.
   Polaroid, which introduced instant snapshots in 1948, is based in
Cambridge, Mass., but incorporated in Delaware.
   ``I don't think this implies a change in the approach of Shamrock
to the offer or really any material change in the offer,'' said Alex
Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Arguments in the Chancery Court case are scheduled for Friday.
Shamrock said it would extend its offer for Polaroid past next
Monday's expiration date to wait for a court ruling.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady in Thin European Trading, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was holding steady in lackluster trading
in Europe late this morning, and traders said they expected little
movement before the Wednesday release of U.S. trade figures for
October.
   Gold prices moved up.
   Several traders said that provided the trade report doesn't
contain any major surprises, the U.S. currency is likely to maintain
its stability through the end of the week, and possibly through the
end of the year.
   A widely expected increase in a key West German interest rate on
Thursday and a possible increase in U.S. interest rates also aren't
expected to have a major impact on the dollar.
   ``Most of the banks are done for the year,'' one Rome trader
said. In addition, he said, the market feels that ``there's a
political will to keep the dollar stable.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.14 yen to a closing 123.06 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 123.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7438 West German marks, up from 1.7410; 1.4680
Swiss francs, up from 1.4650; 5.9625 French francs, up from 5.9520;
1.9552 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9635; 1,285.30 Italian lire, up
from 1,282.75; 1.2008 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8300, compared with
$1.8418 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.50 a troy ounce,
down from $419.75 bid late Monday. But at midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of
$420.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.00, up from $419.25 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at a bid
$421.54.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.14 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Monday.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen in thin
trading today as the market awaited new U.S. trade figures. Share
prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 123.06 yen, up 0.14 yen from Monday's close
of 122.92 yen. The currency opened at 122.90 yen and stayed in a
narrow range between 122.89 yen and 123.15 yen.
   Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank said most currency traders were
sitting on the sidelines to await the U.S. Commerce Department's
announcement Wednesday of the nation's trade figures for October.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicated today
he will maintain the central bank's present monetary stance.
   Speaking at a luncheon, Sumita said the current dollar-yen
exchange level is more or less acceptable.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
shed 121.13 points on Monday, fell 74.48 points, or 0.25 percent,
Tuesday, closing at 29,597.81. After the index dropped 18.91 points
shortly after trading began, following a similar trend on overseas
markets, the Tokyo market could not reverse its downtrend.
   ``The index fell because domestic interest rates rose as the
dollar's uptrend began,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage.
   He said rising interest rates generally discourage interest in
buying stocks.
   ``It's kind of a formula in stock trading,'' he added.
   Other dealers said most institutional investors, as well as
individuals, were sitting on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. trade
report.

   Share prices were higher but below their morning
peaks at midday Tuesday, boosted by a growing belief that British
interest rates won't have to be increased further.
   Dealers said prices were marked up in very thin trading, with
many players still cautious ahead of Wednesday's release of U.S.
trade figures for October.
   But property and retailing stocks, hurt recently by fears of yet
higher interest rates, proved especially strong Tuesday as the
interest rate concerns receded.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.9
points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,757.8 at about 12:45 p.m., below the
peak of 15.5 points up.
   Volume was a modest 287.8 million shares, but up from 230.1
million shares at the same time a day earlier.
   The market continued to react to Monday's news that British
retail sales volume dropped 0.5 percent in November from October,
apparently suggesting that recent interest rate increases are
already cutting back consumer spending.
   That suggests the government won't have to boost base lending
rates above the present 13 percent to choke off the consumer boom
and squeeze out inflationary pressures, dealers said.

<HEAD>GM Restores Profit Sharing For First Time Since 1985</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. employees will receive profit
sharing for the first time since 1985, but their payments will be
fractions of those received by their counterparts at the other two
major U.S. automakers.
   GM said Monday that it expected to pay out about $90 million to
its 450,000 hourly and salaried employees who worked all of 1988, or
about $200 per worker. Those working less than a full year could
receive lower payments.
   About 200,000 of the GM workers are employed in Michigan.
   The estimated 1988 payments are based on a new profit-sharing
formula first negotiated between the United Auto Workers union and
Ford Motor Co. in 1984 and now in place at Chrysler Corp. and GM as
well.
   But employees at Ford _ which has fewer employees than GM but is
more profitable _ could expect profit sharing payments of more than
$2,100 each this year, company spokesman Tom Foote said. Ford
workers have received profit sharing each year since 1984, including
an average $3,700 per worker in 1987.
   Chrysler employees could expect profit sharing payments exceeding
the $500 minimum guaranteed under the No.3 automaker's contract with
the UAW, said Anthony St. John, vice president of human resources.
   GM said in a statement that a large capital-expenditure program
left its 1986 and 1987 earnings too low to trigger profit-sharing
provisions. Much of that program, which included the addition of new
equipment, has been completed.
   ``The GM employees have been part of a truly great team effort to
redirect GM to assure its competitive position for the future,''
Chairman Roger B. Smith said. ``We have come a long way, and the
profit-sharing payments are further evidence that General Motors has
turned the corner and is achieving improved results in our U.S.
operations while providing job security for our employees.''
   The payments, to come out of GM's pretax profits from domestic
operations, were made possible by improved sales and quality and
successful cost-control efforts, Smith said.
   ``While the anticipated amount of profit-sharing per worker will
be quite modest, the basic news that GM is making money while our
members enjoy greater job security provided under the national
agreement is welcome indeed,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Donald Ephlin, director of the union's GM department, said
in a joint statement.
   The formula now in place with all Big Three automakers is based
on the ratio of profits to U.S. sales rather than profits exceeding
a defined minimum annual return. GM's expected 1988 payments will
trail those of Ford in part because GM earns a greater share of its
automotive profits overseas.

<HEAD>Mine Workers Set Strike Deadline For Pittston Employees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers is urging other
unions and their supporters to withdraw funds from banks lending
money to Pittston Group as part of a campaign designed to pressure
the coal company into negotiating a contract.
   In addition, the UMW is ``organizing for a possible boycott of
all Pittston subsidiaries, includinference
Monday and set a Jan. 31 strike deadline if Pittston doesn't agree
to a new contract with 2,000 members in three states.
   Pittston President Gene Matthis said a strike would be
``unfortunate'' and severely affect communities in which the company
has coal operations.
   Trumka said the union's campaign against Pittston will ``increase
pressure against the company on all fronts'' to negotiate.
   The campaign has included demonstrations in New York, Washington,
Richmond and Greenwich, Conn., where Pittston is headquartered. The
union also planned an advertising campaign in the Wall Street
Journal and in local newspapers in the coalfields and in Connecticut.
   ``Our campaign is designed to reach out to the company during the
holiday period and shortly after the first of the year and try and
get them back to the bargaining table,'' Trumka said.
   The UMW president said he announced the strike deadline more than
a month in advance because ``we want to give every last
opportunity'' to a negotiated settlement. ``This gives us 47 days to
work out an settlement.''
   ``We want to go the last step, the last mile, to see if an
agreement can be reached,'' Trumka said. ``But this is one union
that has never run from a fight, and we're prepared to fight this
one.''
   ``We think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carry
through with this,'' Matthis said. ``It would create a lot of
hardship in some of these communities.''
   Matthis has said the company will continue to operate if the
union strikes.
   Pittston miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky have been
working without a contract for 11 months, since the 1984 national
coal contract expired last Jan. 31. Trumka said there have been no
negotiations since Nov. 9, when Pittston gave the union ``a
take-it-or-leave-it-offer.''
   ``The `offer' they made would eliminate the eight-hour day,''
Trumka said. ``It would weaken safety rights, force our members to
work on Sundays and substantially increase their out-of-pocket
health care costs. It would allow the company to gain exclusive
control of our pension plan _ including the ability to unilaterally
change or cancel it at any time.''
   Pittston dropped out of the national coal industry bargaining
organization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement,
saying the company's needs were different than those of the rest of
the industry. The union has accused the company of engaging in
``surface bargaining,'' however, and contends Pittston has
demonstrated no interest in reaching an agreement.
   ``We can't discuss their needs because they haven't told us what
their needs are,'' Trumka said. ``They've sent mid-level managers
(to the negotiating table) with no authority to change a word on the
piece of paper.''
   Trumka said he also requested a ``one-on-one meeting'' with
Pittston Chief Executive Officer Paul Douglas, ``but he didn't even
have the courtesy to respond.''
   Matthis said his company's latest offer is better than the
contract the UMW recently signed with A.T. Massey Coal Co., ending a
bitter conflict that began in 1984, and he said he doesn't expect
talks to resume soon.
   According to Trumka, before the 1984 contract expired the UMW
offered Pittston a no-strike agreement in exchange for a promise
that the company would sign the contract negotiated between the UMW
and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   ``When the company refused, the union went a step further and
offered to work under an extension of our existing agreement with
Pittston until we could reach a satisfactory agreement to both
sides. Again, Pittston dismissed the union's offer out of hand,''
Trumka said.
   ``In fact, Pittston's actions went far beyond a mere dismissal of
the union's efforts to negotiate a strike-free agreement. In the
dead of winter, management abruptly cut off all health care benefits
to 1,500 UMWA retirees, widows and disabled miners _ people who had
sacrificed the best part of their lives to make Pittston a very,
very profitable corporation.''

<TEXT>
   A Chrysler Corp. subsidiary says it will lay off
500 workers at Detroit Trim, one of four Acustar Inc. plants that
the United Auto Workers union agreed to allow to close in its
contract with Chrysler.
   The workers' last day will be Dec. 23, which is when production
is scheduled to end, company and union officials said Monday.
   The plant makes seat covers and other soft automotive trim.
   Last March, Chrysler announced the plant would close. Chrysler
Vice President Anthony St. John said Monday the exact closing date
was only recently determined.
   The plant employed 1,064 people when the closing was announced,
and about 800 employees are still working. The workers remaining
after Dec. 23 will be laid off March 3, Chrysler and UAW officials
said.
   All Detroit Trim workers will be eligible for the Chrysler-UAW
job bank and will continue to receive full paychecks and benefits
until they find other jobs within Chrysler.
   ``Most of the people are disturbed about leaving their jobs,''
said Sam Palazzola, president of Local 212. ``I don't know what's in
the future.''
   In addition to Detroit Trim, the UAW contract allowed Chrysler to
sell or close its Amplex Van Wert powdered metal plant in Van Wert,
Ohio; Trenton, Mich., Chemical and Detroit Forge.

<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. is asking West Point-Pepperell Inc. to
call a shareholder meeting to consider a $1.4 billion takeover bid,
but the Georgia-based textile maker first wants to determine who
supports such a gathering.
   Farley, a Chicago-based apparel manufacturer, had received
requests for a meeting from shareholders representing more than 25
percent of Pepperell's shares, Chairman William Farley said Monday.
   ``We can now look forward to hearing that the board of West
Point-Pepperell has set a meeting date so that our offer finally can
be considered,'' Farley said.
   A Pepperell spokeswoman said the company received the request and
asked the Corporation Trust Co. of Wilmington, Del., to review the
solicitations that have been received by Farley.
   A report should be issued by Dec. 19, said the spokeswoman, who
asked that her name not be used.
   Pepperell stock on Monday rose 75 cents to close at 42\.
   Based in West Point, Ga., West Point-Pepperell is the country's
largest publicly held textile manufacturer. It makes Gold Toe socks,
Arrow shirts and Martex towels.
   Farley, maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear and several other
clothing brands, last Wednesday extended its $48-per-share buyout
bid until midnight EST Dec. 14. The company announced on Dec. 2 its
intention to seek the special shareholder meeting.
   ``Our intention from the outset has been to sit down with
Pepperell's board and negotiate a mutually acceptable acquisition of
Pepperell,'' Farley said. ``But the board would not meet with us.''
   At the meeting, Farley would ask shareholders to replace the
board with nominees representing the Chicago company, Farley said.
   The new board would then dismantle defenses Pepperell has
arranged against takeovers.
   Farley is seeking to overturn Pepperell's ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan in court. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has scheduled a hearing on the matter in Atlanta for the
week of Jan. 9.

<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Engineers Inc. says it has formed
a consortium to bid for construction of a $200 million plastic auto
parts plant in the Soviet Union.
   The contract would be to design, equip and start a plant to make
plastic parts for the Vaz 2110, a car the Soviets showed off last
week at a trade show in New York, the Rockford company said Monday.
   Financing has been arranged through Britain's Barclays Bank PLC,
which would pay the consortium for its work, then collect from the
Soviet Union.
   Ingersoll is hopeful this arrangement will give it the edge over
competitors from West Germany, Japan and Italy for the contract.
   ``The Soviets tell us they would like a U.S. company to do it,''
said Donald B. Ewaldz, a senior partner with consulting firm.
   The company is capable of ``filling a gap they don't have,'' said

<HEAD>Judge Clears Way For Popeyes To Begin Buying Church's Stock</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits
could start moving forward again in its hostile takeover of Church's
Fried Chicken following a federal judge's approval of certain
financial disclosures by Popeyes owner Al Copeland.
   Copeland has said he's been offered 14.6 million Church's shares
_ about 40.6 percent of the company's outstanding common stocks _ at
$8 per share. But U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz issued an
order Nov. 28 preventing Copeland from buying the tendered stock
until 10 days after he provided additional financial information
related to the buyout.
   Schwartz approved the disclosures Monday and agreed to lift the
blocking order as soon as Copeland makes some minor court-ordered
changes.
   Popeyes attorney Peter Butler said the New Orleans-based company
was pleased with the ruling and planned to submit the new text by
Wednesday.
   Among other items, the disclosures lay out a tentative plan for
disposing of Church's 1,076 company-owned restaurants. Copeland
wants to keep 83 restaurants under the Church's name, put 303 under
the Popeyes name, and sell 440 for about $160 million. He would also
immediately close 250 Church's restaurants.
   San Antonio-based Church's announced Monday it was closing 120
restaurants in 20 states, effective Saturday. Ernest Renaud,
president and chief executive officer, said the stores lost $7.4
million in the past year.
   ``They should have been closed a year ago, but this is just part
of my plan to make the company profitable again,'' Renaud said.
   Church's board of directors is trying to find other buyers to
fend off Popeyes $290 million buyout offer, which it has said is not
enough.
   But the directors have been sued by a shareholder who says the
Popeyes offer is fair and the board's refusal to accept it could
harm shareholders' financial interests.

<HEAD>EEC To Examine Siemens-GEC Bid For Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community will
examine the joint bid for Plessey Co., a British electronics
company, by rival General Electric Co. and Siemens AG of Germany
following a formal complaint by Plessey, an EEC spokesman said on
Tuesday.
   The spokesman said that Plessey's complaint focused on a breach
of EEC antitrust rules by Siemens and GEC in making the joint 1.7
billion pound bid, which amounts to $3.1 billion.
   The EEC bans industrial agreements which are likely to distort
free competition.
   The Plessey case is the second major takeover battle that the EEC
has been asked to deal with in recent months and shows that its role
in policing mergers in the EEC is growing, the spokesman said.
   In August, the EEC blocked a consortium bid for Irish Distillers
Group and forced the companies in the consortium to bid
independently for the Irish whiskey maker.
   Normally the EEC can intervene in mergers only after they take
place except if the takeover involves a consortium of companies. It
is trying to persuade EEC govermments to adopt rules that will allow
the EEC antitrust authorities to intervene in mergers before they
occur.

<HEAD>Economists: Government Should Stop Raiding Social Security Surplus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 11, The Brookings Institution, with description

<TEXT>
   Keeping Social Security's promises to today's
workers will be a lot easier if the government stops using the
system's trust funds to cover deficits in other federal programs,
three Brookings Institution economists say.
   Using the trust funds as a form of enforced national savings
would spur economic growth and ease the burden of providing pensions
in the 21st century for the Baby Boom generation, the economists
said in a book released Monday.
   The economists gave a qualified ``yes'' to the question they
posed in the title of their book, ``Can America Afford to Grow Old?
Paying for Social Security.''
   But their assessment is contingent upon early, painful action to
wipe out the big deficit in the government's other accounts. One
author, Barry P. Bosworth, said there is no way to do that without
raising taxes.
   ``If you do this, you kind of destroy the argument that you can
solve the deficit on the expenditures side,'' Bosworth said at a
news conference.
   Bosworth and colleagues Henry J. Aaron and Gary Burtless also
suggested that even if Social Security's trust funds are used as a
form of national savings, the payroll tax may still have to be
raised by 6.9 percentage points over the next 75 years to keep
Social Security and Medicare from running deficits.
   The total payroll tax is now 15.02 percent, divided equally
between employee and employer. It is scheduled to peak in 1990 at
15.3 percent, or 7.65 percent for each.
   Social Security is currently rolling up $40 billion annual
surpluses that soon will become $100 billion-a-year surpluses.
   ``The growing surpluses in the Social Security system camouflage
a major deterioration in the budget balance for (non-Social Security
and Medicare) operations,'' said the Brookings experts.
   ``The payroll tax, ostensibly earmarked for retirement,
survivors, disability and hospital insurance, is being used
increasingly to pay for other government expenditures, such as
defense and interest on the public debt,'' they said.
   The Brookings Institution is a Washington think tank. Its
economists' work was paid for in part by the Social Security
Administration.
   While the government reported a $155 billion budget deficit for
fiscal 1988, it was $210 billion in the red if the $55 billion
surpluses in Social Security and Medicare were not counted.
   If the Social Security trust funds were used to buy up the old
national debt, that would add to the national savings rate and spur
growth, the economists said.
   Such a step would ``relieve future generations of workers of all
or most of the burden from the added costs of pension benefits'' in
the next century when the baby boomers reach old age, it said.
   However, the economists said, ``If national saving is not
increased, then these programs will impose significantly greater
burdens on future generations than they do on current generations.''
   If the politicians are unwilling to act to save the trust funds
instead of using them to finance current consumption, the Brookings
experts recommended lowering the payroll tax to prevent a big trust
fund buildup. But such a pay-as-you-go approach would also mean
higher payroll taxes 20 or 30 years from now.
   Social Security under current law is scheduled to build its
reserves to more than $12 trillion _ $2 trillion in today's dollars
_ over the next 40 years, then draw them down over the following
decades.

<HEAD>Atari Challenges Nintendo ``Lockout''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Games Corp. has sued rival computer
giant Nintendo Co. of Japan for $100 million, accusing Nintendo of
monopolizing the home video game market with a system that locks out
competitors' game cartridges.
   The U.S. District Court suit filed Monday said Atari Games of
Milpitas, Calif., has finally developed ``the functional equivalent
of a key that will unlock the lockout system,'' after suffering $30
million to $35 million in damages over several years. The suit seeks
triple damages under antitrust laws.
   Lynn Hvalsoe, general counsel for Nintendo of America Inc. in
Redmond, Wash., Nintendo's U.S. subsidiary, declined comment on the
suit.
   Atari Games was founded in 1985 as a privately held company and
is not affiliated with Atari Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., a publicly
held company.
   Atari Games said Nintendo controls more than 80 percent of the
U.S. market for home video game machines. The suit said Nintendo has
equipped its machines for several years with a computer chip that
allows the machines to accept only video game cartridges that have a
compatible chip.
   ``Using this barrier and its completely dominating position in
the market for home video game machines, Nintendo has forced the
more than 30 companies that have written games that play on Nintendo
machines to have all of their game cartridges manufactured by
Nintendo at prices it dictates,'' the suit said.
   It said Nintendo likely will earn more than $1 billion in revenue
this year from U.S. sales of home video cartridges that play on its
machines. Nintendo's exclusionary practices limit competition and
variety on the market and drive up prices, the suit said.

   The stock market pulled back today, extending the
modest decline of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost nearly 4
points on Monday, was down another 9.07 at 2,130.51 after the first
30 minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of more than 5 to 3
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 291 up, 563
down and 582 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.54 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 18.54 million shares at the same
point in Monday's session.
   Trading was expected to be subdued today as the market looks
ahead to Wednesday's scheduled release of the nation's merchandise
trade deficit for October.
   Most analysts expect the deficit will be little changed from the
$10.46 billion imbalance reported for September.
   But many traders were reluctant to take a position in advance of
the trade number, which could affect the Federal Reserve's credit
stance.
   Federal Reserve policymakers are to begin a private two-day
meeting today at which they were expected to chart a course on money
policy for the next few weeks.
   Some analysts think they may tighten credit before the end of the
year if the economy shows signs of expanding too rapidly.
   In a new report today, the Commerce Department said retail sales
jumped 1.1 percent in November, following a revised 1.6 percent rise
in October.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE was Detroit Edison,
unchanged at 16|. Among the blue-chip issues, Exxon was unchanged at
44|, General Electric was down } at 45\, General Motors was down ~
at 85| and American Telephone & Telegraph was down \ at 29.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.48 at 154.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
index was off 0.66 at 296.01.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 3.91
loss at 2,139.58.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the

   A senior official of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said Tuesday that Japan won't be
able to reduce its trade surplus to the government's target for
calendar 1988.
   The official did not predict how much the surplus would shrink.
He noted, however, that over the past three monthly reports the
trade surplus has risen in comparison to a year earlier, probably
putting the target out of reach.
   The government's target was to cut about $11 billion off Japan's
1987 surplus, which came to $79.8 billion. The surplus in calendar
1987 was narrower than the 1986 surplus of $82.7 billion.
   On Monday, the Finance Ministry said Japan's merchandise trade
surplus soared 38 percent in November to $6.55 billion in comparison
with $4.75 billion in November 1987.

<HEAD>Deficit Smallest in 3 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade narrowed to $30.9 billion from July through September, the
smallest imbalance in three years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said America's deficit in its current
account fell by 8.4 percent from a second quarter level of $33.7
billion as U.S. manufacturers continued to enjoy a boom in export
sales.
   The current account is the most important trade statistic because
it measures not only trade in merchandise but also trade in
investments and other services. The third quarter deficit was the
smallest imbalance since a $27.6 billion deficit in the third
quarter of 1985.
   Half of the improvement in the latest quarter came from a 5.6
percent decline in the merchandise deficit as exports of both
agricultural products and merchandise increased.
   Also showing improvement was the investment and services
category, which had posted an $837 million deficit in the second
quarter, the first deficit in this category in 30 years. For the
third quarter, this had returned to a surplus of $757 million.
   The current account, also known as the country's balance of
payments, hit a record deficit of $153.96 billion in 1987.
   In the first nine months of this year, the current account
deficit has been running at an annual rate of $135.42 billion
deficit. While this is a significant improvement, it still leaves
the current account deficit at a high level.
   This figure is important because it translates into the amount of
money foreigners have to lend or invest in the United States. The
string of deteriorating current account deficits beginning in 1982
has meant the United States has gone from being the world's largest
creditor nation to the largest debtor country as Americans have
handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for
imported goods.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments than
Americans own in overseas investments. The question of the
willingness of foreign investors to continue holding U.S.
investments is likely to be the biggest economic problem facing
President-elect Bush.
   The dollar fell sharply in the days following Bush's election as
investors feared his no-tax pledge and the larger Democratic
majorities in Congress would mean a continuation of the seven-year
budget deadlock. To reassure jittery markets, Bush has taken to
pledging at every opportunity that he views tackling the budget
deficit as his top priority.
   At the end of last year, America's net debt had grown to $368.2
billion and many economists believe the current account's
performance this year will push the net debt level above $500
billion by the end of 1988.
   Some economists have warned that the debt service burden will
eventually lower Americans' standard of living by reducing the
amount of money available in this country for government operations,
business investment and individual consumption.
   The Reagan administration has sought to play down the
significance of the country's net debtor status, saying that the
cost of financing that debt is still a tiny fraction of the
country's $5 trillion economy.
   Economists said, however, that the deficit in the services
category in the second quarter, although small, was an ominous
event. Before 1982, America was able to count on surpluses from its
overseas investment earnings to erase perennial merchandise trade
deficits.
   But with foreigners now holding a bigger share of U.S.
investments, the country will never be able to eliminate its current
account deficit unless it starts running surpluses in the
merchandise category, something that even optimistic forecasters say
will be impossible until well into the next decade.
   For that reason, some economists have forecast that the level of
the country's net debtor position will approach $1 trillion before
it starts to show any improvement.
   For the third quarter, the deficit in merchandise trade declined
to $28.53 billion, its third consecutive quarterly improvement.
Added to this figure was an increase to $3.12 billion in U.S.
foreign aid and pension payments overseas.
   The small $757 million surplus in investments and other services
is subtracted from those deficit figures to arrive at the current
account deficit of $30.89 billion.
   Many economists fear that the improvement in the trade deficit
this year, which has accounted for almost half of the overall growth
in the economy, is in danger of stalling next year without a major
push by the Bush administration to open up foreign markets and
without further declines in the value of the dollar.
   The National Association of Manufacturers issued a report today
calling on the Bush administration to move aggressively to use the
powers in the new trade bill to open foreign markets.
   ``We've made significant advances toward reducing the U.S. trade
deficit, but, unless policymakers cooperate, we face the danger of a
mid-point stall and a large trade deficit that will continue to
plague us far into the next decade,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
executive vice president of the manufacturers' group.

<HEAD>Newspaper Pulls Comic Strip Aimed At RJR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The hometown newspaper of R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. has pulled a comic strip in which a Reynolds
applicant has trouble saying, ``Cigarettes do not cause cancer''
without laughing.
   A one-paragraph statement on The Winston-Salem Journal's Sunday
editorial page said editors pulled the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip
because they ``felt it singled out for an unfair attack the city's
largest company and would be personally offensive to its employees,
their families and a large number of the Journal's readers.''
   Spokesmen for Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes
Doonesbury to 900 newspapers worldwide, said it was the first time
Garry Trudeau's controversial comic strip has been pulled from a
newspaper ``in deference to a corporation.''
   ``It certainly won't be the last time,'' said Lee Salem,
Universal Press's editorial director.
   The comic strip came on the heels of last month's takeover of the
food and tobacco giant by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $24.53
billion, the largest corporate buyout in U.S. history.
   More than 40 Journal reporters and editors sent a memo to
Publisher Joe Doster protesting the withdrawal of the comic strip.
And four people called John Gates, editorial page editor, to
complain.
   ``Virtually to a person, they said they felt they were old enough
to determine whether something was offensive for themselves, and I
have long since given up trying to make the distinction between
censorship and editorial judgment to these people,'' Gates said.
   Doster, who made the final decision, was not available for
comment this morning, his secretary said.
   Gates said Sunday's ``Doonesbury'' was ``hilariously funny.'' But
he added that the comic strip's ``timing was bad,'' coming on the
heels of last month's buyout of RJR-Nabisco Inc., R.J. Reynolds's
corporate parent.
   ``It was sort of like kicking somebody when he was down,'' Gates
said.
   But Salem said: ``When else would one talk about R.J. Reynolds,
except when it's in the news?''
   Maura Payne, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem,
said the comic strip ``misrepresents the company's position on the
subject of smoking and health, and does a disservice to our
employees.''
   Executives of Reynolds and other cigarette companies, when they
address what they call ``the smoking and health controversy,'' say
the link between smoking and disease in humans has not been
scientifically proven.
   Reynolds spokeswoman Betsy Annese said the company considered the
strip ``a terrible affront to the honest, hard-working employees''
of RJR. The Journal's decision to pull the strip was ``a nice
gesture,'' she said.
   Over the years, newspapers across the country have pulled
``Doonesbury'' when it poked fun at various public figures,
including President Reagan, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Sen.
John Warner of Virginia and entertainer Frank Sinatra. Newspapers
also have withdrawn the strip because of statements about the
Vietnam War and other controversial issues.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service said today
it is investigating allegations that Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
defrauded customers who buy its credit information.
   Joseph Clark, the Cincinnati postal inspector handling the
investigation, said he has questioned several Dun & Bradstreet
employees, but declined to give details.
   ``We're in a position where we wouldn't deny it, but I can't
comment further than that on the specifics of the investigation,''
Clark said.
   Clark said the investigation developed from allegations in a suit
filed in U.S. District Court here by a Dun & Bradstreet salesman who
alleged that the company engaged in misrepresentations to induce
customers to buy more credit-reporting services than they needed.
   The company has denied the allegations and said it has begun an
internal investigation.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that the investigation is
focusing on the Cincinnati office of Dun & Bradstreet, one of the
nation's biggest credit-reporting services.
   U.S. Postal Service investigators have requested internal Dun &
Bradstreet documents and the company is complying, said Reid
Gearhart, a spokesman at Dun & Bradstreet's New York City
headquarters.
   ``I believe that's being done right now,'' Gearhart said.
   Dun & Bradstreet salesmen William Lewis and Gary J. Mertz told
the Wall Street Journal that Clark interviewed them and several of
their colleagues.
   Lewis and Mertz told the newspaper that Dun & Bradstreet managers
have for years encouraged salesmen to misrepresent to customers how
much of the credit data they bought was needed. Customers who relied
on those representations would buy more credit information than
needed, Lewis and Mertz told the Journal.
   Dun & Bradstreet has said it settled with 11 Philadelphia-area
customers who claimed they bought more services than needed. Those
customers complained to Dun & Bradstreet after receiving an
anonymous letter, apparently from inside the company, the Wall
Street Journal reported.

   Soybean futures prices fell sharply at the opening
of trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a drop triggered
by continuing showers in the South American soybean belt, analysts
said.
   Grain futures opened slightly lower.
   ``I think it's all pretty much the rain in South America

   The weather has been unusually hot and dry during the ongoing

significant precipitation during the weekend and showers were

soybean-producing region, Balletto said.

   The stock market gave ground today, reflecting
nervousness about interest rates after a stronger-than-expected rise
in November retail sales.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points
on Monday, was down another 5.16 at 2,134.42 at noontime on Wall
Street.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 4 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 458 up, 750 down
and 641 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.73 million shares at noon
compared with 63.67 million shares at the same point in Monday's
session.
   Analysts attributed the decline this morning to deepening worries
that interest rates could be headed higher, making short-term
Treasury issues relatively attractive compared with stocks.
   As Federal Reserve policymakers gathered for a private two-day
meeting at which they are expected to chart a course on credit, the
government reported stronger-than-expected growth in November retail
sales.
   The Commerce Department said November sales rose 1.1 percent,
about twice as big a gain as many analysts had expected. It also
revised upward its estimate of growth in October to 1.6 percent from
the initial report of 0.9 percent.
   The report sent bond prices lower early in the session, and stock
prices followed. Both bonds and stocks later retraced some lost
ground.
   ``It's the old good news is bad news syndrome,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``Anything that smacks of economic vigor does not sit well with
the market,'' he said.
   Trading volume was relatively subdued, however, in advance of
Wednesday's scheduled release of the nation's merchandise trade
deficit for October.
   Most analysts expect the deficit will be little changed from the
$10.46 billion imbalance reported for September.
   But many traders were reluctant to take a position in advance of
the trade number, which could affect the Federal Reserve's credit
stance.
   Some analysts think the Fed may tighten credit before the end of
the year if it determines the economy is expanding too rapidly.
   Texaco rose 1[ to 51~ and was among the most active issues on the
NYSE. A group led by Carl Icahn disclosed it holds a 15.83 percent
stake in the oil company.
   Pillsbury was up { at 62|. On Monday, it rejected as inadequate a
sweetened $63-a-share takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan.
   Among other actively-traded blue-chip issues, General Electric
was off | at 45], Exxon was unchanged at 44| and American Telelphone
& Telegraph was unchanged at 29\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.32 at 155.02. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
index was off 0.76 at 295.91.

   Carl C. Icahn disclosed today he has raised his
stake in Texaco Inc. to 15.8 percent, raising fresh questions about
the takeover strategist's ultimate plans regarding the third-largest
U.S. oil company.
   Icahn said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he purchased 2.6 million shares of Texaco stock
between Dec. 7 and Dec. 12 for $131 million, or an average of about
$50.37{ a share. His filing did not not explain why he bought the
stock.
   But the move vaulted Icahn's stake over the 15 percent threshold,
which under the takeover laws of Delaware, where Texaco is
incorporated, means he must raise his ownership to 85 percent or
wait at least three years before attempting any acquisition effort
that would result in the company's breakup.
   Wall Street has been rife with rumors lately that Icahn _
Texaco's largest shareholder _ might renew his effort to either buy
the company, provoke a takeover attempt by some other investor, or
conduct a second shareholder proxy fight to wrest control of Texaco
from its board of directors.
   His first effort to win control in a shareholder vote was
defeated earlier this year. But Icahn didn't rule out the
possibility of undertaking another fight later.
   Icahn's disclosure today further clouded his intentions, because
it was seen as a possible sign he might want to sell out his
interest in Texaco.
   Texaco stock rose $1.50 a share to $52.25 in heavy early trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting speculation that Icahn's
move might at least provoke another takeover bid.
   Officials at Texaco's White Plains, N.Y. headquarters declined to
comment on Icahn's stock purchase. Icahn did not return telephone
calls to his executive offices in nearby Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
   Icahn is chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., one of his
successful acquisitions, and widely is regarded as a shrewd
financier and takeover investor who has gone after some of the
biggest U.S. corporations, such as USX Corp. and Phillips Petroleum
Co.
   He began building a stake in Texaco as the company was struggling
to emerge from federal bankruptcy court protection between April
1987 and May 1988. Texaco sought protection as a result of Pennzoil
Co.'s record $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco over the disputed
purchase of Getty Oil Co. in 1984.
   Texaco settled with Pennzoil by paying it $3 billion in cash and
emerged from bankruptcy protection by undertaking a major
restructuring to divest billions of dollars in assets. Most of the
proceeds from those sales will go to shareholders and to pay down
debts.

   The number of insolvent savings and loan
associations fell further from July through September, but the
improvement was partially offset by the 22 thrift institutions that
slipped into insolvency, the government said today.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which on Nov. 29 reported on
the industry's loss for the third quarter, said the number of
insolvent institutions fell from 498 as of June 30 to 434 as of
Sept. 30. At the end of last year, there were 520 insolvents.
   However, even as the government resolved or stabilized the cases
of 86 S&Ls during the third quarter, 22 more slipped into insolvency.
   The S&L industry is piling up the biggest loss this year since
the Depression. Losses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion, down
from $3.9 billion in both the first and second quarters.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, declined to say
whether he thought thrift institution performance would improve or
worsen in the fourth quarter, but he warned that rising interest
rates will cut into earnings.
   The relative health of commercial banking stands in stark
contrast to the condition of savings and loan institutions.
   The nation's commercial banks are posting record profits this
year and should have another good year in 1989, unless the Third
World debt problem worsens dramatically, analysts say.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits up to
$100,000 in 13,239 commercial banks, said Monday that the industry
earned $5.9 billion in the July-September period, topping the
previous quarterly record of $5.8 billion set a year ago.
   Earnings totaled $5.0 billion in the first quarter of this year
and $5.5 billion in the second.
   ``I think we can say without much question that this year will be
an all-time high for banking profits,'' FDIC Chairman L. William
Seidman told reporters.
   The agency is predicting profits will top $23 billion in 1988,
surpassing the record $18.1 billion earned in 1985. Last year, the
largest banks took big writedowns on loans to Third World countries,
holding the industry's earnings to $3.6 billion, the weakest since
the Depression.
   Banks did not take further writedowns this year, but ``the LDC
(less developed country) debt does remain a key overhanging issue,''
said James H. Wooden, an analyst with the investment firm Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The FDIC said the fact that Brazil has resumed payments on its
huge foreign debt, following a moratorium, should add $1.5 billion
to the fourth-quarter bank earnings total.
   But, Wooden warned, ``there's some expectation that Argentina is
going to go non-performing. ... And if the government loses the
election in Brazil next November, we could be back to square one
there.''
   Despite the good news for banks, Seidman sounded notes of caution
regarding an increase in bad loans and banks' rising involvement in
leveraged buyouts.
   Bad loans, on which borrowers have stopped making payments,
jumped 4.3 percent from the second quarter to $76.5 billion in the
third, the FDIC said. Much of the increase came in the Southwest,
where the economy has been depressed by troubles in the oil industry.
   However, bad real estate loans in the New England states, New
Jersey and Florida also rose.
   ``We need to keep a careful eye on that,'' Seidman said. ``...
But they are not, I repeat not, at alarming levels and not like the
Southwest.''
   Robert G. Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co., said,
``There's no question that real estate prices bolted up pretty high
in some areas and there are some vulnerabilities there. Fortunately
it doesn't seem to be national in scale.''
   Seidman also said that a substantial, but undetermined, share of
bank income is coming from the boom in corporate buyouts.
   ``Leveraged buyout transactions are becoming a big part of
banking activity and that does increase the risk to some extent,''
he said, but added: ``At this point ... I don't have any evidence
that would indicate that institutions are going to fail because of
leveraged buyouts.''
   The strong 1988 earnings, paradoxically, are coming amid the
worst year for bank failures since the Depression. Through last
week, 213 banks either failed or were saved from failing through
government assistance. That already tops the record of 203 for all
of last year.
   The failures reflect continuing troubles in the Southwest, and to
a lesser extent the fallout from farm problems earlier in the decade
in the Midwest. Of the failures this year, 114 were in Texas, 24 in
Oklahoma, 11 in Louisiana, nine in Colorado, eight each in Minnesota
and Kansas and seven in Iowa.

   McDonald's is the king of the fast-burger business
in Japan, but only at the cost of constant price wars and assaults
by competitors who entice the Japanese palate with recipes including
soy sauce and rice.
   American-style fast food has become a multibillion-dollar annual
business since McDonald's Co. arrived 17 years ago in this nation of
sushi and noodle soup eaters.
   Thousands of outlets are being added at a rate of almost one a
day, and the competition to grab customers has intensified in recent
months.
   McDonald's, which sold 300 million hamburgers and had $1.2
billion in sales here last year, launched a campaign in October
featuring a hamburger, french fries and a cola for 360 yen ($2.95).
   McDonald's spokesman Tatsuki Kubo said the campaign celebrates
the achievement of one trillion yen ($8.1 billion) in sales since
the company began its business in Japan in 1971.
   The new promotion offers a 25-cent discount from last year's
``Sankyu set,'' which triggered a price war. ``Sankyu'' is the
Japanese pronunciation of ``thank you'' and also means ``39'' _ a
reference to the price of 390 yen ($3.20) for the same combination.
   ``We can lower prices by combining a hamburger with fries and a
drink, cost prices of which are very cheap,'' Kubo said.
   Lotteria Co., the No. 2 chain with $496 million in sales in 1987,
said McDonald's campaign is an attempt to win back customers that
Lotteria had grabbed with its ``380-yen trio'' that was launched a
few months after McDonald's ``Sankyu Set.''
   Lotteria first tried to compete by putting a little more meat and
lettuce in sandwiches, said the firm's Tetsuo Uchimoto, but bigger
burgers weren't attracting more customers. So, in the summer of 1987
Lotteria undercut McDonald's price by 10 yen (8 cents) on the
burger-fries-cola combination.
   Now that McDonald's is down to 360 yen, yet another competitor,
Meiji Sante Ole, with 75 outlets in eastern Japan, has knocked 20
yen (16 cents) from three sets on sale at about 10 outlets located
near McDonald's restaurants, said an official of Sante Ole, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Wendy's, a U.S. chain that has 30 outlets mainly in eastern Japan
after eight years in the country, has joined the price war, said
Ryokichi Morishita of the Daiei Corp., Wendy's parent company in
Japan.
   Wendy's ``cannot compete with others on the same level,''
Morishita said, but it has set prices from 280 yen to 390 yen ($2.30
to $3.20) on combinations normally costing 320 yen to 560 yen.
   Cheaper prices may not always increase sales, however. A
27-year-old stockbroker anonymously said, ``I wouldn't buy a 360-yen
set when I only want a hamburger.''
   Yuko Nomura, a 23-year-old office worker, said in a letter
published recently in the Asahi Shimbun daily that she was offended
when a clerk strongly recommended ``a set'' when she had ordered a
hamburger and coffee.
   Meanwhile, Mos Food Service is competing by opening new Mos
Burgers outlets at a break-neck pace and tops the list with 747
followed by McDonald's 644 and Lotteria's 542, though Mos is third
in sales, with $434 million last year.
   Mos Burgers made the largest sales increase of 38.2 percent last
year, followed by McDonald's 10.1 percent and Lotteria's 8.2 percent.
   Its locations, however, are less visible than those of the top
two companies, which are easily found along major highways and at
the center of big cities.
   ``We don't want to spend money on buying expensive pieces of
land,'' Mos spokesman Kazuhiro Kobayashi said, adding, ``instead, we
have tried to build more shops in cheaper areas.''
   Kobayashi said the company plans to open about 150 new outlets a
year, while McDonald's and Lotteria said each will add about 50.
   Mos Burgers' menu, more Japanese than the others, includes
chicken teriyaki sandwiches and rice-burgers _ the latter has meat
flavored with soy sauce in a rice cake instead of a bun. Those two
sandwiches accounted for 20 percent of sales last year, Kobayashi
said.
   Another competitor, Morinaga Love, recently added a ``Healthy
Burger,'' with 20 percent less fat than normal hamburger, according
to the company.
   The First Kitchen, a chain which introduced a ``Beef-salad
Burger'' in October, said, ``It's a pain that McDonald's 360-yen set
may attract many customers who tend to think `the cheaper the
better.'''
   Burger chains said unanimously that their survival strategy is to
offer something new and different, and to create tastes that suit
Japan's food culture.
   And to take on the Big Mac.
   ``I guess taste is the ultimate factor to be successful in any
kind of food business,'' Lotteria's Uchimoto said.
   ``I don't care if kids go to McDonald's for the 20-yen
difference, because we aim at adults,'' he said, ``McDonald's is the
target until we beat it.''

<HEAD>Al Copeland, Popeyes Founder, Has Expansion on His Mind</HEAD>

   If Al Copeland's bid to take over Church's
Fried Chicken falls through, it will cost him, by his own
estimation, about $5 million.
   He can afford it, however.
   ``I'm not interested in losing money. I don't expect to,'' says
Copeland, whose net worth is put at $200 million. ``I think I can
always make more, though. I've always had that kind of faith in
myself. I can always make another million.''
   Not bad for a guy who grew up in a New Orleans housing project,
dropped out of school at 16, and started his working life as a soda
jerk.
   ``I'm having a ball. I really am. My life is like a story about
the American Dream. I always had the desire to make it big and I
always knew I had the ability to make it big,'' said the 44-year-old
founder of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits.
   He owns 96 percent of Popeyes and, although he still puts in
12-hour work days, he finds plenty of time to enjoy everything from
offshore powerboat racing, to his splashy display of Christmas
lights that attracts hundreds of thousands of viewers to his
corporate headquarters every year.
   As a 16-year-old high school dropout with no training and no
special skills, Copeland worked two jobs _ days at a local
supermarket soda counter and nights at his brother's doughnut shop.
   He scraped together enough money to buy his own doughnut shop in
1962. But even then he was thinking chicken.
   ``The chicken business looked pretty attractive to me, but I knew
that I'd have to have a product I considered better than Kentucky
Fried Chicken's if I was going to compete,'' he said.
   In 1972, he opened ``Chicken on the Run'' in New Orleans,
featuring fast service, but a chicken recipe that lacked bite. He
had toned down his own pepper-laden, Cajun style formula at the
behest of friends who said it wouldn't sell.
   In the first year, he said, the store lost almost $13,000.
   He decided to go with his original recipe. He renamed the
business Popeyes and started what became the third largest chicken
chain in the country.
   Popeyes now has 725 outlets and is expected to do about $500
million in business this year.
   ``I set a goal of being a millionaire by the time I was 30,'' he
said. He made it easily.
   After that, Copeland said he set himself a goal of making $100
million. He has now reached that goal.
   ``Now it's a billion dollars. It's not the money anymore. Now
it's just a way of keeping track. You have to have a goal, so that's
mine,'' he said.
   Copeland is not at all shy about using his wealth to do what he
likes.
   His 12-car collection now includes a new Rolls Royce, a
custom-made Porsche, and a $100,000 Lamborghini. He has four racing
boats and has held the U.S. title for a record five years in
offshore power boat racing.
   He owns a helicopter, and a 100-foot yacht.
   His corporate offices, on the fifth floor of Popeyes Plaza in
suburban New Orleans, feature art deco interiors, electronic blinds,
and push buttons that produce hidden televisions, bars, and indirect
lighting. His 26-room mansion in New Orleans has an indoor pool and
a gym where he works out two-hours a day with a personal trainer.
   The kid who once marveled at the Christmas lights along Canal
Street in New Orleans, now sets up a 500,000 light display at his
office that attracts 350,000 sightseers a year. The electric bill
alone runs $50,000 a month.
   He used to have the display set up at his house, but a neighbor,
who was upset because he couldn't drive down his street because of
the traffic, sued to stop the practice.
   Copeland's effort to take over Church's, the second largest
chicken chain in the country, landed him in court again. But a
federal judge this week apparently cleared the way for Copeland's
tender offer to proceed.
   Copeland has said he's been offered 14.6 million Church's shares
_ about 40.6 percent of the company's outstanding common stocks _ at
$8 per share.
   And he's confident the takeover will benefit everyone involved.
   ``Look, they have 1,500 stores, twice as many as we have, but
we'll sell as much this year as they will. That's with half as many
units. We could really be a good thing for them,'' he said.
   If the takeover goes through, Copeland will move into second
place in the chicken business, behind Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   If he doesn't get Church's, Copeland said he'll continue to
expand Popeyes and look for new challenges. He's already broken out
of the fast-food mold with a series of his Copeland's Cajun-American
Cafes _ sit-down restaurants with a menu of spicy offerings.
   ``It's not money now,'' Copeland says as he talks about his
expanding empire. ``I've got that. Now I just want to make my mark.
You know what I mean. I want to have made my mark by the time I'm
done.''

<HEAD>Harry J. Gray Resigns From UTC Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry J. Gray, whose deal-making helped
build and redefine United Technologies Corp. into a defense and
industrial giant, has resigned from the company after 17 years.
   Gray, who was thought to be preparing a takeover of UTC earlier
this year, retired as the company's chairman two years ago but had
continued on the board until Monday.
   Gray would have been forced to retire from the board next
November when he turned 70, the mandatory retirment age for UTC
directors.
   Gray said an in interview Monday that his investment group, Harry
Gray, Mel Klein & Partners, left him little time for UTC.
   Last winter Gray teamed up with Texas businessman Melvyn N. Klein
and Chicago financiers Jay A. Pritzker and Thomas J. Pritzker to
raise investment capital. In January, Gray, known by corporate
insiders as the ``father of the hostile takeover,'' denied rumors
that his investment group was targeting UTC for takeover.
   Gray said Monday that he was uninterested in any hostile
takeover, of UTC or any other company. ``Life's too short,'' he said.
   Gray presided over an eightfold expansion of UTC's annual revenue
and today the company rings up annual sales of $17 billion.
   Gray's partnership was a co-investor in a group that lost in the
feverish bidding for RJR Nabisco Inc. after raising about $550
million in capital.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. won the fierce battle for RJR
Nabisco on Nov. 30 with a $24.53 billion bid.
   ``In thinking over the requirement of times on something like RJR
Nabisco ... I decided that, in all fairness to the partnership and
in all fairness to UTC, we probably were going to get into time
conflicts,'' Gray said.
   UTC's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert F. Daniell,
accepted Gray's resignation on Monday.
   ``United Technologies will miss Harry's advice and counsel,''
said Larry Bingaman, a UTC spokesman, adding that Gray was ``in
large measure responsible for United Technologies becoming the
company it is today.''
   Gray was hired in 1971 as president of Connecticut's largest
company, then known as United Aircraft and known mainly for
aerospace products such as Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Sikorsky
helicopters and Hamilton Standard propellers.
   He soon added the titles chairman and chief executive officer and
changed the company's name to reflect a move into other businesses
such as Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.

<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi Corp., the largest Japanese trading
house, said Tuesday its consolidated profit rose 31.2 percent in the
first half of its fiscal year, reflecting healthy demand for its
steel products and higher prices for nonferrous metals.
   For the six months ended Sept. 30, Mitsubishi's net earnings
totaled 21.0 billion yen, or approximately $171 million, up from
16.0 billion yen a year earlier, the company said. Per share net
rose to 13.34 yen from 10.31 yen.
   Sales, or total trading transactions, rose 11.4 percent to 7.107
trillion yen, or $57.8 billion, from 6.377 trillion yen.
   The first-half results include returns from 100 full-line
consolidated subsidiaries.
   The yen figures were converted into dollars at a rate of 123 yen
to the dollar. The yen was actually somewhat weaker than that during
most of the reporting period.

seesawing throughout the session ahead of a late rally.
   Shares rose briskly in early business in what dealers called a
technical response to recent sharp declines.
   The market then was unnerved in the afternoon by news of
stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. retail sales. But traders
regained their confidence, amid speculation that for the moment
Britain's inflationary picture seems under control.
   The market in early trading was reacting to Monday's news that
British retail sales volume dropped 0.5 percent in November from
October, analysts said. That apparently suggests recent interest
rate increases already are cutting back consumer spending seen as
fueling inflation.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 4.7
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,752.6. The index rose as much as 15.5
points at late morning before falling back in the afternoon.
   Volume totaled 473.9 million shares, compared with Monday's 460.7
million shares.

   Stock prices drifted at lower levels this
afternoon, reflecting nervousness about interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points
on Monday, was down another 8.36 at 2,131.22 with two hours left in
the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 9 to 5 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 465 up, 894 down
and 577 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93.51 million shares at 2 p.m. on
Wall Street compared with 90.21 million shares at the same point in
Monday's session.
   Analysts attributed the decline to deepening worries that
interest rates could be headed higher, making short-term Treasury
issues more attractive in comparison with the uncertain yields on
stocks.
   As Federal Reserve policymakers gathered for a private two-day
meeting at which they are expected to discuss tightening credit
conditions, the government reported stronger-than-expected growth in
November retail sales.
   The Commerce Department said November sales rose 1.1 percent,
about twice as quickly as analysts expected. It also revised upward
its estimate of growth in October to 1.6 percent from the initial
report of 0.9 percent.
   The report sent bond prices lower early in the session, and stock
prices followed. Bonds later recovered some lost ground, however.
   Trading volume was relatively subdued, however, in advance of
Wednesday's scheduled release of the nation's merchandise trade
deficit for October.
   Most analysts expect the deficit will be little changed from the
$10.46 billion imbalance reported for September.
   Detroit Edison led the list of most actively-traded stocks on the
NYSE, rising [ to 16}.
   Texaco was up ~ to 51|. A group led by Carl Icahn disclosed it
holds a 15.83 percent stake in the oil company.
   Pillsbury was up { at 62|. On Monday, it rejected as inadequate a
sweetened $63-a-share takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan.
   Among other actively-traded blue-chip issues, General Electric

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.60 at 154.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
index was off 1.06 at 295.61.

   An investment group seeking to buy TW Services
Inc. for $1.14 billion extended its tender offer Tuesday until Jan.
5 and sent the food-service giant the draft of a takeover agreement
to show its sincerity.
   TW Services officials had no immediate comment on the moves by
Coniston Partners, an investment concern run by three New York
takeover strategists who have been pursuing the company for months.
   Coniston said in a statement that under the $29-a-share tender
offer it began in late October, 85.3 percent of TW's 48.6 million
shares of stock outstanding had been been tendered.
   TW has been fighting the takeover with its so-called poison pill
defense designed to make a hostile bid prohibitively expensive.
Coniston has challenged the defense in court.
   The target company has called Coniston's offer too cheap and
implied the investment group is interested only in selling its 9.3
million shares for a profit or breaking up the company and selling
it piecemeal.
   In response, Coniston said it had given TW's board of directors
copies of a draft merger agreement, to demonstrate that the
investment group is seriously interested in running the company.
   ``We urge you to give the enclosed form of agreement prompt and
serious consideration, and we remain ready to meet with you or your
advisors at any time,'' Coniston said in the letter, which it made
public.
   New York-based TW is the parent company of 1,200 Denny's
restaurants, 400 Hardee's fast-food drive-ins, the food service
concern Canteen Corp., 27 nursing homes and two retirement homes.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies in
Europe Tuesday, but traders said there was little trading ahead of
Wednesday's release of U.S. trade figures for October.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar largely was sidelined by
a drop in the British pound as some investors took profits from
sterling's recent surge. Dealers said most of the drop took place
earlier in Tokyo, but the pound continued drifting lower during the
European day.
   The pound has fallen consistently since last Wednesday. The pound
had risen strongly before then as investors moved to take advantage
of the latest, Nov. 25 increase in British interest rates.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.8280 from $1.8418 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7470 West German marks, up from 1.7410; 1.4705
Swiss francs, up from 1.4650; 5.9775 French francs, up from 5.9520;
1.9715 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9635; 1,286.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,282.75; and 1.1995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.14 Japanese yen to close at 123.06
yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.09 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $420.75 a troy ounce,
compared with $419.75 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to close at
$420.45 compared with a bid of $419.25 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at a bid of
$421.54 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $6.17 a troy ounce, compared with
Monday's $6.14.

   Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola Co. increased their
shares of the U.S. soft drink business this year, outpacing the
industry's 4.5 percent growth, an industry analyst said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola Classic, meanwhile, remained atop the list of the
best-selling soft drinks in the United States, according to Jesse
Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest.
   Meyers estimated industry sales reached $43.2 billion at retail
this year.
   According to Beverage Digest, Coca-Cola's entire line of products
captured 40.5 percent of the U.S. soft drink market this year, up
from 40.3 percent last year. The Pepsi-Cola line was second as its
market share increased to 30.7 percent from 30.2 percent.
   Volume increases at both companies exceeded the 4.5 percent
growth in overall U.S. soft drink sales, Meyers said.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's volume rose between 5 percent and 5.1
percent, while volume at Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers, N.Y., rose
between 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent, according to preliminary
figures from Beverage Digest.
   Dr Pepper's entire line gained market share as it retained its
No. 3 position with 5.6 percent of the market, up from 5.4 percent a
year earlier.
   Fouth-ranked Seven-Up's corporate share of the market fell to 4.9
percent from 5.3 percent a year earlier, while fifth-ranked Royal
Crown Cola Co.'s share fell to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent.
   Meyers said A&W Brands demonstrated it is ``the hot, second-tier
soft drink company'' as it moved up to sixth place from seventh
among the soft drink makers.
   A&W, which has expanded its line beyond its A&W Root Beer base,
increased its corporate share to 2 percent from 1.6 percent share a
year ago.
   Among the individual brands, Coca-Cola Classic remains the
nation's most popular soft drink and continues to gain market share,
Meyers said.
   Coca-Cola Classic boosted its market share from 19.8 percent last
year to 20.1 percent this year, while No. 2 Pepsi's share slipped
from an 18.8 percent share in 1987 to 18.7 percent this year, Meyers
said.
   In 1985, Coca-Cola discontinued the drink in favor of a new
formulation, but quickly brought it back under the name Coca-Cola
Classic in response to what it said was consumer demand.
   ``Everybody should make such mistakes,'' Meyers said in a
telephone interview from Greenwich, Conn., where he publishes
Beverage Digest.
   Other leading brands, as tabulated by Beverage Digest, are: Diet
Coke, 8.2 percent; Diet Pepsi, 5.2 percent; Dr Pepper, 4.5 percent;
Sprite, 3.6 percent; Mountain Dew, 3.2 percent; Seven-Up, 3.1
percent; and Caffeine-free Diet Coke, 2 percent.
   There was a three-way tie for 10th place as RC Cola, reformulated
Coke and Caffeine-free Diet Pepsi each had 1.4 percent of the market.

   Corn futures closed strongly higher Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade on hopes for new export sales while soybean
prices fell and wheat finished mixed.
   Corn's rally was fueled by a late surge of buying on persistent
rumors that the Soviet Union was in the market for up to 1 million
metric tons of U.S. corn and sorghum, analysts said.
   ``They're always talking about exports but it remains to be seen
if anything comes up,'' said Jon Horton, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The soybean market was weak all day on reports of rain in the
South American soybean belt and forecasts for more precipitation in
Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean producer after the United
States. Conditions have been unusually dry during the South American
planting period.
   Wheat's mixed performance reflected disappointment that an
expected offer of up to 3 million metric tons of subsidized U.S.
wheat to the Soviet Union had not materialized, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 4\ cents higher with December at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 1 cent
lower to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.06{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1{ cents to 6 cents lower with January at $7.65{ a bushel.

   Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson, who triggered
the multibillion-dollar buyout battle for RJR Nabisco Inc., last
week sold 60,000 shares of RJR stock for nearly $5.5 million,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday.
   The stock sale came about a week after RJR directors rejected the
buyout bid from a management investor group led by Johnson in favor
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s record $24.53 billion takeover
offer.
   The one-page SEC filing said the 60,000 common shares had
belonged to Johnson's wife, Laurie, but could be considered
beneficially owned by him. They were sold in the open market on Dec.
7 for $91 each, or $5.46 million, the filing said.
   It was not immediately known how many RJR shares Johnson owns or
his profit from the latest sale.
   Before the management group sparked the takeover activity with a
$75 a share buyout proposal in late October, the Atlanta-based
company's stock traded around $56 a share.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes $1.384 Million Fine For Pepperidge Farm Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs further quotes, details.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Health and Safety
Administration Tuesday proposed fining a Pepperidge Farm Inc. plant
nearly $1.4 million for exposing workers to dangerous working
conditions.
   The $1.384 million fine will be imposed if Pepperidge Farm does
not contest it within 15 working days, said Jack Hord, spokesman in
Philadelphia for OSHA, an arm of the U.S. Department of Labor.
   The Norwalk, Conn.-based company said the fine was ``arbitrarily
assigned and totally unjustified'' and said it would contest the
alleged violations.
   There have been eight proposed fines higher than the Pepperidge
Farm proposal, according to Frank Kane, OSHA spokesman in Washington.
   Fifty workers at Pepperidge Farm's plant in Downingtown, Pa.,
developed carpal tunnel syndrome, an inflamation of the sheaths
around nerve endings, in the fingers, wrists and shoulders,
according to Hord. Twenty-six of them required surgery, Hord said.
   The injuries resulted from repeatedly putting together sandwich
cookies, Hord said.
   OSHA's six-month investigation recorded 389 willful violations of
record-keeping rules and safety standards at the 1,500-worker plant,
according to a news release.
   There were gaps and inaccuracies in illness records and although
the plant had a manual on how to prevent the injuries, officials did
not implement the recommendations, according to OSHA.
   ``Management was clearly aware of the need to address ergonomic
hazards at this Pepperidge Farm plant, yet chose to ignore its own
experts and employees while more and more employees suffered
crippling injury,'' said John A. Pendergrass, assistant Secretary of
Labor and OSHA head.
   ``The results were predictable: an increase in injuries, repeated
trauma for previously injured employees, high turnover at the plant
and a call to OSHA for help,'' Pendergrass said.
   In disputing the proposed fine, Pepperidge Farm said the disorder
can occur in all occupations that involve repetitive movements.
   ``We have been singled out and chastised for a phenomenon common
to myriad jobs _ both blue-collar and white-collar _ requiring
repetitive movement of hands and arms,'' Richard A. Shea, Pepperidge
Farm president, said in a prepared statement.
   The company said it has been improving its Downingtown operation
for the past three years by installing automatic case packers and
redesigning the assembly line. The company also has been rotating
workers involved in repetitive motions every 20 to 30 minutes,
Pepperidge Farm said.
   ``We have spent in excess of $275,000 over the past two years to
improve the ergonomics of our cookie operation,'' said Dale Stokes,
manager of the Downingtown plant. ``We are slated to spend an
additional $250,000 over the next year on the ergonomic design of
our cookie assortment line.''
   The company is reviewing its record-keeping of injuries,
according to a press release.
   There are eight U.S. Pepperidge Farm plants, including four that
make cookies, said Karen Sportini, company spokeswoman. The other
cookie factories are in Willard, Ohio; Richmond, Utah, and Lakeland,
Fla., she said.
   After checking within OSHA, Akio Konoshima, an agency spokesman
in Washington, said he was not aware of any investigations at
Pepperidge's other plants.

   The Imperial Valley's winter iceberg
lettuce crop is threatened by insects and bad weather, the same
problems blamed for shortages and high prices a year ago.
   However, experts don't expect prices to soar to last winter's
levels.
   Whiteflies have been a problem in the desert area that stretches
from California's Imperial Valley to Yuma, Arizona and that provides
almost all of the nation's iceberg lettuce each winter.
   ``We have a very similar situation to last year, but what has
made it a little tougher and accentuated the deep problem was the
extreme heat here in October,'' said grower Joe Colace.
   The heat put stress on young lettuce plants and increased the
number of the flies that can stunt formation of lettuce heads or
cause leaves to yellow, he said.
   Desert iceberg lettuce is bringing $10 to $14 for a carton of 24
heads, more than the price received two years ago but well under
last year's prices.
   ``This time last year we were upwards of $20 a box,'' said Colace.
   However, industry experts did not predict prices to equal last
winter, when supermarkets sold iceberg lettuce as high as $1.59 a
head.
   Prices have been kept from soaring as high as in 1987 by late and
heavy harvests that lasted through November in the southern San
Joaquin Valley and the Ventura areas, but Colace expected tight
supplies through the rest of December.
   Any shortage was expected to be less severe because Imperial
Valley growers planted about 35,000 acres to iceberg lettuce this
year, up about 12 percent from 1987.
   ``Last year was a very, very unusual season. I don't think you'll
see another like it,'' said Bob Lee of the Arizona agriculture
department's fruit and vegetable division in Yuma. ``I think people
will give up lettuce before they pay those prices again.''
   Lettuce, California's number one vegetable crop, grossed $598
million for the state growers last year compared with $485 million
in 1986, according to Department of Food and Agriculture statistics.

<HEAD>Economy Better Next Year, Purchasing Managers Predict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy is likely to do better in 1989
than it has this year, because of growth in exports and capital
spending, the nation's purchasing managers said in a report released
Tuesday.
   Fifty-three percent of the purchasing managers surveyed felt
their businesses would be better in 1989 than in 1988, compared with
13 percent who expected it would be worse, the National Association
of Purchasing Management said. The rest thought it would be about
the same.
   The report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more
than 250 industrial companies in all 50 states.
   ``The exceptionally high level of optimism expressed by
purchasing managers about the next 12 months overshadows their
concerns regarding inflation, rising interest rates and the budget
deficit,'' Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's Business
Survey Committee and director of materials management at Pitney
Bowes Inc., said in a written statement.
   ``Overall, they're expecting a continuation of a very healthy
growth throughout all of 1989, perhaps heavier in the first half
than the last half,'' Bretz said in an interview.
   On inflation, 87 percent predicted their companies would be
paying higher prices at the end of 1989 than at the end of 1988, and
of those, the average inflation forecast was 4.2 percent. Seven
percent predicted lower prices, with an average forecast decline of
2.4 percent.
   The association said the combination of answers on inflation
translated into a prediction of a net average price increase of 3.7
percent in 1989. The managers expect a net average price increase of
5 percent for this year.
   Members reported their companies were operating at the highest
percentage of capacity since May 1979. The 76 percent who said 1988
fully measured up to their expectations was the most to say so since
1978.
   The top three concerns mentioned by the purchasing managers were
inflation, cited cited by 22 percent; rising interest rates, 14
percent; and the federal budget deficit, 13 percent.
   On capital expenditures, 42 percent said they expected to spend
more in 1989, while 24 percent said they expected to spend less.
   Asked a broader question about the outlook for the economy in
general, not just their own companies, 48 percent said they were
satisfied or optimistic, the highest reading for a December survey
since December 1983.
   Fifty percent said they were concerned and 2 percent said they
were worried or pessimistic.

<TEXT>
   America West Airlines announced Tuesday that it
had ordered 15 737-300 jetliners and 10 757 commercial jets from
Boeing Co. in a deal worth about $800 million.
   The Phoenix-based carrier also took options for 10 more 737-300s
and 15 757s.
   The airline will receive the initial 25 planes over a three-year
period beginning in 1992.
   The 737-300 is a twin-engine plane that can carry 141 passengers
up to 2,800 miles. It sells for $25 million to $30 million,
depending on configuration.
   The 757 is a larger twin-engine plane, capable of carrying 178 to
197 passengers, with a 4,600-mile range and a price tag of $41
million to $47 million.
   Michael J. Conway, president of America West, said money for the
new planes would come from company earnings, proceeds from selling
currently owned aircraft, and financing.

<HEAD>Postal Service Investigating Dun & Bradstreet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service said Tuesday
it is investigating allegations that Dun & Bradstreet Corp., one of
the nation's largest credit rating companies, defrauded customers
who purchase its credit information.
   Joseph Clark, the Cincinnati postal inspector handling the
investigation, said Tuesday he has questioned several Dun &
Bradstreet employees, but declined to give further details.
   Clark said the investigation developed from allegations in a
lawsuit pending in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.
   The suit was filed by Dun & Bradstreet salesman Joseph M.
Davidoski, who alleged that the company engaged in
misrepresentations to induce customers to purchase more
credit-reporting services than they needed. The company has denied
the allegations and said it has started an internal investigation.
   Davidoski said he sued after he took his complaints to a company
supervisor in June and received no satisfaction.
   U.S. Postal Service investigators have requested internal Dun &
Bradstreet documents, and the company is complying with the request,
said Bill Doescher, a spokesman at Dun & Bradstreet's New York City
headquarters.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the investigation
focuses on Dun & Bradstreet's Cincinnati office.
   Dun & Bradstreet salesmen William Lewis and Gary J. Mertz told
the Journal that Clark interviewed them and several of their
colleagues.
   Lewis and Mertz told the newspaper that Dun & Bradstreet managers
routinely encouraged the company's sales representatives for years
to misrepresent to customers how much of the credit data they were
buying was actually needed. Customers who relied on those
representations would buy more credit information than necessary,
Lewis and Mertz told the newspaper.
   Dun & Bradstreet has said it reached settlements with 11
Philadelphia-area customers who said they were persuaded to buy more
credit-report services than they needed. Those customers complained
to Dun & Bradstreet after receiving an anonymous letter, apparently
from inside the company, the Journal reported.

   A late surge in blue-chip issues left the stock
market narrowly mixed Tuesday amid worries about the course of
interest rates.
   A spurt in the final minutes of trading enabled the market's
best-known indicator to erase exactly the modest loss it recorded a
day earlier. But several broader market gauges finished lower for
the day.
   And analysts said the pace of activity was tempered by
anticipation of the October trade report which is to be released on
Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points
on Monday, made it all back on Tuesday, gaining 3.91 to close at
2,143.49.
   The index had been down nearly 15 points with 30 minutes
remaining in the session and was off nearly 10 points five minutes
before the close.
   ``The blue chips have been leading the market and maybe they are
doing it again,'' said Thomas Czech, first vice president for
research at the brokerage Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee.
   He noted that the dollar has been strong, and said the late
blue-chip buyers may suspect the trade deficit report will help the
market.
   In the broader market, however, declining issues outnumbered
gainers by about 9-to-5 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 541 issues up, 890 down and 570
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 132.34 million shares, up
from 124.16 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
157.30 million shares.
   Analysts attributed the decline in the broader indexes to
deepening worries that interest rates could be headed higher, making
yields on short-term Treasury issues more competitive with the
uncertain returns on stocks.
   The nervousness was heightened because Federal Reserve
policymakers were gathering for a private two-day meeting at which
they are expected to assess the economy's strength and whether
inflation is becoming a problem.
   In the latest indication of the economy's health, the Commerce
Department reported that November retail sales rose 1.1 percent,
about twice as big a gain as many analysts had expected. It also
revised upward its estimate of growth in October to 1.6 percent from
the initial report of 0.9 percent.
   The report sent bond prices lower early in the session, and stock
prices followed.
   ``It's the old good news is bad news syndrome,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``Anything that smacks of economic vigor does not sit well with the
market.''
   Also on Tuesday, a majority of the nation's purchasing managers
who responded to a survey indicated they expect the U.S. economy to
do better next year than it has in 1988.
   But analysts said traders were reluctant to take a position in
advance of Wednesday's report on nation's merchandise trade deficit
for October, which many economists expect will be little changed
from the $10.46 billion imbalance reported for September.
   Texaco was one of the most active issues on the NYSE, rising ~ to
51| on takeover speculation as a group led by Carl Icahn disclosed
it holds a 15.8 percent stake in the oil company.
   Bormans was the biggest percentage gainer on the NYSE, rising 11}
to 24~ after disclosing it was negotiating on a takeover offer at
$27 a share.
   Pillsbury rose } to 62~. On Monday, it rejected as inadequate a
sweetened $63-a-share takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan.
   Among other actively-traded blue-chip issues, American Telephone
& Telegraph rose [ to 29], General Electric fell [ to 45~ and Exxon
rose ~ to 45{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $2.288 billion, or 0.08
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.10 to 155.24.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index slipped 0.01 to 318.42, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.21 to 276.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.22 to 372.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.85 to 295.82.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Weakens In New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON-BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened Tuesday in a mild rally
that dealers attributed to year-end demand for the currency and some
optimism that an impending report on the monthly U.S. trade deficit
would not cause alarm.
   Gold prices weakened slightly in U.S. trading after rising in
Europe and falling in Asia. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$419.50 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down 75 cents from its late
Monday quote.
   Currency strategists said stepped-up commercial demand for
dollars, a usual occurrence at the end of the year, was partly
behind the dollar's strength.
   They also said there was a consensus in the market that the U.S.
trade deficit for October, to be reported Wednesday by the Commerce
Department, would be around $10.5 billion. Expectations of that
figure, which would be substantially unchanged from the previous
month, also helped the dollar.
   The trade statistics fluctuate sharply but have enormous
potential to affect the dollar because they are the most visible
evidence of American competitiveness abroad. A widening deficit
would put downward pressure on the dollar while a narrowing gap
would tend to strengthen the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.14 Japanese yen to close at 123.06
yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.09 yen. By the
time trading closed in New York the dollar fetched 123.29 yen, up
from 122.80 yen late Monday.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.8280 from $1.8418 Monday. In New
York, sterling fetched $1.8190, down from $1.8435 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7497 West German marks, up from 1.7415; 1.4717
Swiss francs, up from 1.4642; 1.1999 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1970; 5.9790 French francs, up from 5.9485; and 1,288.71 Italian
lire, up from 1,284.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7470 marks, up from 1.7410; 1.4705 Swiss francs,
up from 1.4650; 5.9775 French francs, up from 5.9520; 1.9715 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9635; 1,286.50 Italian lire, up from 1,282.75;
and 1.1995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1983.
   Gold prices moved in a narrow range, largely reflecting internal
market influences. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion
for current delivery finished down 30 cents a troy ounce at $419.80.
   Earlier in London, gold rose $1 an ounce to $420.75; in Zurich it
rose $1.20 an ounce to $420.45; and in Hong Kong it fell 75 cents to
$421.54.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell 0.1 cent a troy ounce to
$6.168. In London, silver rose 3 cents to $6.17.

<HEAD>Judge Issues, Then Stays Injunction In Takeover Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge issued an injunction Tuesday
blocking MAI Basic Four Inc.'s hostile $970 million bid for Prime
Computer Inc. but immediately suspended the order pending an appeal.
   In a written ruling, U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone said
MAI Basic had violated the federal Securities and Exchange Act and
failed to detail its plans for if the takeover succeeds.
   After oral arguments, Mazzone last Friday said he would issue the
injunction and then stay it, and on Tuesday he detailed his
reasoning in the written order.
   Prime sued MAI Basic, controlled by New York investor Bennett S.
LeBow, last month on the grounds that its $20 a share offer failed
to make a full disclosure under federal securities guidelines.
   Prime stock fell 50 cents to $16.12{ a share Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   In his ruling, Mazzone said MAI Basic, a Tustin, Calif.-based
computer firm, failed to disclose the extent of the relationship
between Brooke Partners L.P. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
between LeBow and Drexel in advising and financing the deal.
   The judge also said MAI Basic concealed information concerning
past violations or alleged violations of federal securities laws by
LeBow and William Weksel, another principal in the bid.
   Mazzone's injunction would halt the bid until the additional
disclosures are made, but the injunction is on hold until MAI Basic
appeals to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
   Prime, a Natick-based computer firm about four times the size of
its hostile suitor, late last month rejected the $20-a-share offer.
The offer is to expire Dec. 21.
   MAI Basic owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares
outstanding.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plummet As Peruvian Mining Strike Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices plunged in frantic selling Tuesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange in reaction to the settlement of a 57-day
mining strike in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper producer.
   On other markets, precious metals edged lower; cotton futures
were sharply lower; energy futures declined; grains and soybeans
were mixed; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures
gained.
   Reports of an overnight settlement in the Peruvian mining strike
surprised traders on the Commodity Exchange, where copper futures
prices had been expected to stabilize following a steep sell-off on
Monday.
   ``It came as a shock,'' said Bernard Savaiko, metals analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Copper settled 6 cents to 7 cents lower with the spot contract
for delivery in December at $1.52 a pound and the most actively
traded March contract at $1.29 a pound.
   The strike, which began Oct. 17, was a major factor in copper's
run up to a record $1.6475 a pound on the Commodity Exchange last
week. Analysts said the shutdown, along with a shorter strike in
August, may have cost Peru up to 100,000 metric tons of copper
production and could reduce 1988 Peruvian exports of copper by 30
percent compared with 1987.
   Even with the end of the strike, it will take Peruvian mining
companies at least a month to resume full production and another six
to eight weeks before the first shipments reach fabricators to be
made into copper wire and other forms for industrial use.
   ``You're going to have the supply tightness continuing for a
while but during the holiday period you're not likely to get rising
physical demand, as fabricators are not that active,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   ``The key question,'' said Savaiko, ``is whether or not there
will be adequate supplies to meet demand during the peak consumption
period of the first quarter of year.''
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York noted that
production problems still plague many other copper-producing
countries.
   He said copper's price ``could fall further in the next day or
two, purely because there's a technical run on the downside now, but
the market's still very tight and we expect this thing to rebound
later.''
   Gold and silver futures settled marginally lower on the Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold settled 30 cents to 40 cents lower with February at $424.10
a troy ounce; silver was .10 cent to .70 cent lower with March at
$6.295 a troy ounce.
   Cotton futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange in a
mostly technical sell-off triggered by the Agriculture Department's
2.4 percent upward revision Monday of its 1988-89 U.S. cotton
production estimate.
   ``I would say the whole thing was due not to cotton fundamentals
but to the charts,'' said Ed Whitten, an analyst with Balfour
Maclaine Corp. in New York. ``The crop report may be going to get
some credit, but that was just the icing on the cake.''
   Cotton settled 1.28 cents to 1.64 cents lower with March at 57.55
cents a pound.
   Heating oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange following Monday's strong rally. Crude-oil and gasoline
futures also retreated.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 31 cents
lower with January at $16 a barrel; heating oil was .92 cent to 1.08
cents lower with January at 49.27 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .52 cent to .90 cent lower with January at 43.30 cents
a gallon.
   Corn futures ended strongly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade
on hopes for new export sales while soybean prices fell and wheat
finished mixed.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with December at
$4.27 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with December at
$2.65\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.09{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 5 cents lower with
January at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange following sharp gains in the two previous
sessions.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
December at 72.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with January at 83.97 cents a pound; live hogs
were .25 cent lower to .97 cent higher with December at 42.52 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to 1.50 cents
higher with February at 44.72 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .30 point higher at 279.60. Each point is
worth $500.

<HEAD>Atari Games Launches Double-Barreled Attack on Nintendo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Games Corp.'s double-barreled attack
on Nintendo Co. could be the opening zaps of a broader battle in the
multibillion-dollar home video game market.
   At issue is whether Nintendo, the leading maker of video game
machines, can control the software market by limiting the number of
games it makes under licensing agreements with software developers
and preventing them from making the games independently.
   Atari Games, a licensee, says Nintendo is violating anti-monopoly
laws and has sued for $100 million in damages.
   But Mediagenic, another licensee formerly called Activision, says
Nintendo's controls may be illegal but probably are good for the
market overall.
   Nintendo, a Japanese company with a U.S. subsidiary based in
Redmond, Wash., isn't saying what it thinks, although its attorneys
are studying the lawsuit Atari Games filed against it Monday in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
   Nintendo _ which controls 80 percent of the U.S. market for home
video game machines _ may be planning a countersuit to stop Atari
Games from releasing through its Tengen Inc. software subsidiary the
first independently manufactured video game cartridges for Nintendo
machines.
   Atari Games, a privately-held company based in Milpitas, Calif.
and unrelated to computer-maker Atari Inc., claims its profits have
been hurt because it is required to turn to Nintendo for
manufacturing and is limited in the number of cartridges it may sell.
   ``We have been able to get only a small fraction of the games we
want (to sell) into the market,'' said Dennis Wood, senior vice
president for Atari Games. ``We are so frustrated by our inability
to get the proper supplies.''
   Atari Games says Nintendo has equipped its machines with a
computer chip that allows them to accept only video game cartridges
with a compatible chip.
   ``Using this barrier and its completely dominating position in
the market for home video game machines, Nintendo has forced the
more than 30 companies that have written games that play on Nintendo
machines to have all of their game cartridges manufactured by
Nintendo-Japan at prices it dictates,'' the suit states.
   The suit claims Atari Games lost between $30 million and $35
million because of inadequate supplies. Atari Games is seeking three
times its direct losses, under the provision for treble damages in
anti-monopoly suits.
   Atari's Tengen subsidiary has about $35 million in annual sales.
   Nintendo in recent years has cashed in on what some have
described as an almost cult-like consumer devotion to its games. The
company reported $800 million in sales last year and expects to more
than double that this year.
   Bruce Davis, president of Mediagenic, based in Mountain View,
says Nintendo has maintained its restrictive licensing procedure in
a ``principled way.''
   ``They don't give anyone as much product as they want and they
give some more than others, but that have a rationale for what
they're doing,'' said Davis, whose companies sells two
Nintendo-licensed games, Super Pitfall and Ghostbusters.
   Davis was in Redmond on Monday to negotiate licenses for several
new products.
   Nintendo is trying to control quality and overall inventory, he
said, two areas that led to the collapse of the video game industry
in the early 1980s after astonishing growth in the 1970s.
   Activision and Atari were two of the biggest losers in the
collapse. Atari Games and Atari Inidiary foundered and eventually
was sold and divided.Warner subsidiary foundered and eventually was
sold and divided.
   Davis said Mediagenic, which posted $26 million in sales and
$500,000 in profits in the first six months this fiscal year, could
have sold more Nintendo-based products if it were allowed.
   ``But I can't complain the way Nintendo has conducted business,
given the licensing arrangement,'' he said. ``I would prefer not to
pay a licensing fee or to have them be the sole source manufacturer,
but ... I don't think it's in our interest now to challenge it.''

   Dana Milner believes the future of
trucking is installed in the cab of his 18-wheeler.
   Along with his CB radio, radar detector and several pine-tree
shaped air fresheners, Milner rides with a computer device linking
him via satellite to his home base in Ontario.
   ``It's a pretty handy gizmo,'' said Milner, 27, a leased driver
for Frederick Transport Ltd. of Dundas, Ontario. ``It's what
trucking of tomorrow is all about.''
   Milner no longer must call General Motors Corp. every four hours
to give the progress of his three weekly trips from Ontario to
Baltimore with roof supports for GM vans.
   A Geostar Corp. satellite orbiting 22,000 miles above Earth
automatically tracks Milner's progress and relays the information
through a ground station to a Frederick Transport dispatcher.
   Milner also can send messages with a keyboard if he is stuck in
traffic, has engine trouble or needs emergency help.
   ``I'd say five years from now, you're going to see every major
trucker in the United States and Canada using it,'' said Milner, who
has been a truck driver for the past six years.
   A U.S. Commerce Department report issued in May estimated annual
mobile satellite services revenues could reach $150 million to $200
million worldwide by 1992 and $1 billion or more by 1995.
   In the United States, more than 135,000 units could be in
operation by the end of 1990, according to the report, ``Space
Commerce: An Industry Assessment.''
   Costs for the units, now more than $3,000, are expected to drop
below $500 apiece in coming years.
   The just-in-time delivery system now favored by the automotive
and other industries has broadened he need for improved
communication between dispatchers and truckers, said Edward K.
Morlok, a University of Pennsylvania professor of transportation.
   Under just-in-time delivery, manufacturers get parts when they
are needed for assembly instead of constantly keeping large parts
inventories.
   Most dispatchers now must wait for a driver to call in before
they can reroute a truck or learn if it's delayed, Morlok said.
Drivers, in turn, must find a telephone and often wait on hold for
the dispatcher, he said.
   A 1985 survey published in Motor Carrier Computer News showed 85
percent of trucking companies used telephones to communicate with
their drivers. Most of the remaining U.S. companies among the 1,134
surveyed by The Marketing Research Bureau Inc. used two-way radio.
   Geostar, one of only two companies offering satellite
communications, began its tracking service in May 1987, added
one-way data communication in June and plans to have two-way
communication in January.
   The publicly held, Washington-based company, has 55 clients with
1,025 satellite transponders and orders for 7,500 more, said Geostar
spokeswoman Joanne C. DeVincent. Sales are expected to reach $12
million this year, she said.
   Most companies purchasing the $3,300 to $3,450 units made by Sony
or Hughes corporations are in the long-haul trucking business, but
Geostar also has sold its service to track planes, trains and ships,
Ms. DeVincent said.
   In 1992, Geostar plans to launch a satellite designed to
calculate a vehicle's relative distance to another vehicle to within
5 meters for use as a collision avoidance system.
   QualComm Inc., a privately held, San Diego-based company, in June
began offering a satellite tracking and two-way data communication
system called OmniTRACS, said Richard Beyer, the system's marketing
and sales vice president.
   QualComm has sold the system to 17 trucking companies, and some
43 other companies have expressed interest in the $4,100 units,
which QualComm manufactures.
   QualComm's anticipated annual sales are $70 million for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989, Beyer said.
   Morlok said satellites also can track the progress of valuable or
hazardous cargo, monitor the temperature of a refrigerated truck and
send electronic signals from the engine.
   American Mobile Satellite Consortium, an eight-company consortium
organized in May, wants to give truckers and their dispatchers voice
communication as well.
   The consortium plans in the next five years to launch a satellite
capable of transmitting voice communication anywhere in the country,
said John D. Kiesling, president of Mobile Satellite Corp. in
Malvern, one of the companies in the consortium.
   Frederick Transport has outfitted about 125 of its 620 truck
tractors with satellite systems and hopes to outfit all of them by
April 1989, said Frank Dunton, marketing director.
   ``It's a terrific planning tool because we're able to use it to
plan utilization of our trucks,'' Dunton said. He also said it cuts
the related telephone bills in half.

<HEAD>Tyson Argues Holly Farms Misled Tyson in Takeover Bidding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. misled Tyson Foods Inc.
in an effort to thwart the poultry giant's hostile takeover bid for
its smaller rival, an attorney for Tyson Foods argued Tuesday in
Delaware Chancery Court.
   Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly Farms, the fifth-largest poultry
producer in the country, has rejected two takeover offers from
Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., and the nation's top poultry
producer.
   Holly Farms' board of directors, saying Tyson's latest offer was
not in the best interest of shareholders, said last week it would
proceed with a proposed merger with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   Both deals are valued at about $1 billion.
   The merger agreement, which has yet to be approved by the
companies' shareholders, would allow ConAgra to purchase key assets
of Holly Farms if the deal fails to go through.
   Tyson processes about 2 billion to 2.2 billion of the
ready-to-cook chicken that is raised in the United States.
   ConAgra, a diversified company, produces about 1.5 billion pounds
a year, and Holly Farms processes 1.2 billion pounds.
   The three companies handle about 30 percent of the ready-to-cook
chicken market.
   Tyson went to Chancery Court seeking a preliminary injunction
that would block the ConAgra merger. Attorneys said after Tuesday's
hearing that Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett was not
expected to rule on the injunction until later in the week.
   In rejecting Tyson's latest offer, Holly Farms rejected a bid
that would have given shareholders $53 per share plus a
quarter-share of Tyson stock for each Holly Farms share traded.
Holly Farms has about 20 million shares outstanding.
   Tyson said the cash and stock offer was worth $57 a share to
Holly Farms stockholders.
   In trading Tuesday, Holly Farms rose 62{ cents a share to $54.25
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Tyson rose 62{ cents a share
to $16.75 in over-the-counter trading.
   In its request for the injunction, Tyson argued that the
stockholders' right to the best price was not enforced by Holly
Farms' board of directors. Attorneys claimed the board was
influenced by Holly Farms managers who were unfriendly to Tyson.
   A Tyson takeover likely would lead to top management changes at
Holly Farms, while the ConAgra merger would not, industry observers
say.
   ``The directors' concern was not to get the best price for the
stockholders but to get the best defense against Tyson,'' Tyson
attorney Rodman Ward said.
   Holly Farms failed to get the best offer because it did not press
Tyson for a better one while negotiations were under way with
ConAgra, Ward said.
   At one point during the negotiations, Ward said, a Holly Farms
representative said Tyson could be bidding against itself, although
at that time the board was on the verge of an agreement with ConAgra.
   Ward called that ``an intentional deception of Tyson.''
   But Holly Farms' attorney Steven M. Barna said Tyson knew ConAgra
was a rival.
   Tyson publicly disclosed it had begun takeover discussions with
Holly Farms in October, and mentioned ConAgra in bank documents that
month as a potential competitor, Barna said.
   The terms of bids by ConAgra, the nation's second-largest chicken
producer, and Tyson, required complete secrecy, Barna said.
   ``What they wanted was to have been told who was out there, but
they couldn't have been, under rules established by all parties,''
Barna said.
   ``The process was to get the best offer by giving them no
information,'' Barna said.
   Bruce McNew, an attorney representing shareholders, asked the
court to require open bidding between the two companies.

<HEAD>Self-Regulatory Group Expels Bankrupt Firm For Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
has expelled a bankrupt New York investment firm, suspended its
ex-president and punished five former brokers for stock
manipulation, the self-regulatory organization said Tuesday, calling
it a flagrant fraud that victimized investors.
   The disciplinary action against Rooney, Pace Inc. and the six
individuals capped a 2-year investigation into questionable dealings
in American Educational Computer Inc., an over-the-counter security
that the firm encouraged clients to buy aggressively based on
misleading information. The stock subsequently tumbled under
mysterious circumstances.
   ``These are serious sanctions,'' John Pinto, NASD vice president
for compliance, said in a telephone interview from the association's
Washington headquarters. ``We went after the individuals who were
active in the security and put them out of business for awhile.''
   The NASD runs the U.S. electronic market for over-the-counter
stocks and is the self-regulatory authority for firms that make
markets in these securities. Expulsion and suspension are among its
most powerful disciplinary tools.
   Although the sanctions won't have any practical impact on Rooney,
Pace because it is not active in the securities business anyway,
they could lead to more serious Securities and Exchange Commission
penalties against the individuals.
   In a press statement, the NASD said Rooney, Pace was expelled
from NASD membership, fined $50,000 and censured. Randolph Pace, its
former president, was fined $100,000, suspended from assocation with
any NASD member for two years and suspended from association with
any NASD member in a supervisory role for an additional five years.
   The NASD also said Joe P. Foor of Norman, Okla., a senior vice
president of the firm, and Coy E. Dean, its Oklahoma City branch
office manager, were each censured, fined $50,000 and barred from
association with an NASD member.
   Lesser sanctions were imposed on Daniel Dispigno, a Rooney, Pace
trader from Smithtown, N.Y., and Terry L. Rogers and Thomas C.
Henry, registered representatives with the firm's Oklahoma City
office.
   A person answering the telephone at Rooney, Pace's New York
office said nobody was available to comment and that the whereabouts
of its current president Arnold Weinberg were unclear.
   Rooney, Pace once had 14 offices nationwide and was ranked as the
81st largest brokerage, specializing in underwriting securities of
start-up companies.
   It unsuccessfully sought a merger with another investment group
in late 1986, and intensifying financial trouble subsequently pushed
it into bankruptcy court proceedings.
   The NASD sanctions were not the first time Rooney, Pace was named
in a fraud investigation. In June 1986 it was charged by the SEC
with participating in a stock manipulation scheme that the
enforcement agency said netted more than $4 million in illegal
profits.

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Pleasure-Boat Maker Plans Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of the nation's oldest
pleasure-boat maker is seeking protection in federal bankruptcy
court, while the subsidiary is planning heavy layoffs at its Holland
plant.
   Murray Chris-Craft Boat Cos.' parent, Bradenton, Fla.-based
Murray Industries Inc., asked a federal court in Tampa, Fla., last
week for protection from creditors as it reorganizes under
provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   In Holland, ``we will be reducing our hourly and salaried work
force a minimum of 20 percent over the next two to three weeks,''
Tom Robinson, plant vice president and general manager, said Monday.
   ``Production also will be cut, probably by 20 percent, although
we haven't finalized the details,'' Robinson said. ``We are going to
be very lean in operating our plants and corporate headquarters.''
   The boat maker's gross sales have fallen from $180 million in
1986 to $140 million in the fiscal year ending July 1988.
   But Robinson said he believed the company could solve its
financial woes.
   Murray's reorganizational bankruptcy petition listed bank debts
of $58.8 million and $11 million in trade debts, corporate counsel
John Olson said. The filing, consisting of 16 bankruptcy petitions
stacked 10 inches high, indicates there are more than 1,000
creditors.
   Chris-Craft, with five plants nationwide and 1,200 employees,
produced about 7,500 pleasure boats last year.
   Operations of the company, which was founded 115 years ago in
Algonac, Mich., were sold to Murray in 1981. Its other plants are in
Bradenton, Fla.; Goshen, Ind.; Bellingham, Wash.; and Swansboro, N.C.
   The Holland plant is the largest. As recently as 1983, it
employed about 600 people in production of the classic cruisers. In
recent years, employment has been less than 200.
   ``I don't think they were shocked,'' Bob Kruithoff, business
manager for the International Association of Machinists, said of the
40 remaining union members at the plant. ``They've been running out
of parts for quite a while.''

   Trustees for the estate of National Enquirer
publisher Generoso Pope Jr. on Tuesday announced the splashy
supermarket tabloid is for sale.
   Pope, who died Oct. 2 of a heart attack at his beachfront home,
built the chronicle of UFOs and celebrities' woes from a small New
York tabloid to a glitzy weekly with a 4.5 million circulation.
   The terms of his trust allow for the Enquirer and its sister
tabloid, the Weekly World News, to be sold when practical, said
Jerome S. Traum, one of three trustees for the estate. The other
trustees are Peter P. Peterson, a New York investment banker, and
Citibank.
   A price for the tabloid was not disclosed. But an adviser to
British media mogul Robert Maxwell was quoted in Tuesday's Wall
Street Journal as saying that the Enquirer is ``a $400 million
newspaper.''
   Traum said they decided to sell the Enquirer after they became
aware of the tremendous interest in the paper. However, despite
``many indications of interest,'' there had been no negotiations
yet, he said.
   ``We expect that all the major (media) players will probably be
involved in the selection of the final purchaser,'' Traum said.
   But newspaper industry analyst Edward Atorino of Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York said the fear of being tainted by the
Enquirer's scandal-sheet image most likely would prevent major media
companies from bidding.
   Although the Enquirer flourished, it has been the target of
several celebrity suits. Carol Burnett won $800,000 in a 1981 suit
for libel.
   The sale of the Enquirer and the Weekly World News, with 1.1
million readers, will be handled by the Blackstone Group, a New York
investment banking firm chaired by Peterson, and at least one other
investment banking firm.
   Following Pope's death, the Enquirer's president and editor, Ian
Calder, was named chairman of GP Group, which owns the tabloids.

   For the fourth straight year, Tokyo is the world's
most expensive city and the Venezuelan capital of Caracas is still
the best bargain for Americans living overseas, according to a
survey of 103 cities released Tuesday.
   Tokyo was followed by another Japanese city, Osaka, and Tehran as
the world's most expensive cities, according to the survey compiled
twice a year by Business International, a Geneva-based research and
consulting company.
   The survey uses a weighted index based on a variety of items
ranging from food to entertainment and transportation but not
including housing. It is aimed at helping international companies
determine cost-of-living differentials for their expatriate
employees.
   The survey is based on dollar exchange rates in effect Oct. 8.
   With New York as the base of 100, Tokyo had an index of 203.
Osaka was second with an index of 201, and Tehran was third at 187.
New York ranked as No. 23.
   Libreville, the capital of Gabon, was in fourth place overall
with an index of 162 and remained the most expensive city in Africa.
   In fifth place was Brazzaville, capital of the Congo, with an
index of 155.
   Oslo, Norway tied for sixth place with Abidjan, capital of the
Ivory Coast, with an index of 138. Oslo was also the most expensive
city in Europe.
   Helsinki, Finland, with an index of 128, was No. 8, followed by
Geneva and Tel Aviv, tied for ninth with an index of 123.
   London and Paris both had an index of 109, while Moscow, Los
Angeles and Beijing all had indexes of 97.
   Latin American cities were at the bottom end of the list. Buenos
Aires had an index of 35, while Rio de Janeiro had 33 and Caracas
had 32. All have runaway inflation rates with prices at Rio up 400
percent in 12 months.
   However, the high inflation is offset by regular devaluation of
those nation's currencies against the dollar.
