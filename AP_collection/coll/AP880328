   The president of Dartmouth College on
Monday accused The Review, a conservative off-campus weekly
newspaper, of ``poisoning the intellectual environment of our
campus.''
   ``What the Review has done on this campus has not been decent.
What it has done has been irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel and
ugly,'' President James Freedman said at a faculty meeting.
   He called staff members of the independent newspaper
``ideological provocateurs posing as journalists.''
   Chris Whitman, editor of The Review, did not immediately return
a message for comment.
   The Review has been at the center of controversy since it was
founded in 1980.
   It has been attacked as anti-minority, anti-women and
anti-homosexual and has been championed by such conservatives as
William F. Buckley Jr. and former White House communications chief
Patrick Buchanan.
   Freedman's public criticism of the Review, the strongest to date
by any high-ranking Dartmouth official, came weeks after three
Review staffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probation
for their role in an angry confrontation with a black professor
described by the Review as incompetent.
   The college also announced Monday that Dean Edward Shanahan had
denied the students' request for reconsideration of their cases.
   In addtion, Review staffers in 1986 were involved in a nighttime
sledgehammer attack on symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the
college green.
   Freedman, who left the University of Iowa to become president of
the Ivy League school eight months ago, said: ``It is time for me
to speak out ... because I now see that the Review is dangerously
affecting _ in fact, poisoning _ the intellectual environment of
our campus.''
   The college, Freedman added, ``must not stand by silently when a
newspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seem
virtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women and
members of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling as
students.''
   The college charged that The Review has referred to homosexuals
as ``fairies'' and written that ``some Negroes prefer being
slaves.''
   Freedman disputed claims that The Review is under attack because
it is politically conservative, and he insisted that issues posed
by the Review have ``nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of
expression.''
   He said that the Review represents ``a perversely provocative
style of journalism that vulgarizes responsible conservative
thought and is, in fact, an affront to it.''

   A Chinese immigrant was sentenced Monday to
a year in prison for acting as the middleman in a missile-smuggling
plot involving a high-ranking member of the Chinese mission to the
United Nations.
   Shang-Yao Chi, 65, pleaded guilty Dec. 10 to conspiring to
illegally export 10 TOW II missiles to China.
   Defense attorney Alan Zegas said Chi went along with the plot
out of fear that his brother, an anti-communist like Chi, would be
harmed while in a Chinese prison.
   Chi was arrested in a Customs Service sting operation and
charged with being a middleman between a government informant and
the U.N. diplomat, who has since left the country, prosecutors said.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise could have sentenced
Chi to five years in prison. But he gave a the year-and-a-day
sentence because of what the government called his ``exemplary''
cooperation in the investigation.
   The U.S. government has taken no diplomatic action against
mission officials, and the Chinese government has denied any
involvement in the plot.
   Chi was born in China and lived in nationalist Taiwan for 30
years before joining his daughter in New York City in 1979, Zegas
said. Chi's father was killed during the Cultural Revolution by
Chinese authorities, the lawyer said.
   Zegas said Chi's brother was imprisoned because of his
anti-communist sympathies. ``If (Chi) didn't go through with the
plan, he felt his brother would be murdered,'' Zegas said after
sentencing.

   A federal judge Monday barred the Boys Clubs of
America from adding ``and Girls'' to its name pending the outcome
of a lawsuit by the Girls Clubs of America.
   The Girls Clubs of America filed a trademark-infringement suit
last month to prevent the Boys Clubs organization from renaming
itself the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
   The Boys Clubs has said that the organization has about 300,000
girls among it 1.3 million members, and their parents are demanding
the name change.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy granted the Girls Clubs of
America request to block the national organization from changing
its name for now, but he refused to issue a similar order against
local Boys Club groups.
   Margaret Gates, national executive director of the Girls Clubs
of America, said the Girls Clubs' identity and fund-raising are
threatened by the Boys Clubs' name-change.
   She said Monday that she was pleased with Conboy's ruling but
that local Girls Clubs will be encouraged to sue if the local Boys
Clubs in their areas change their name.
   Ms. Gatessaid the Girls Clubs of America serves about 250,000
girls, and about 40,000 boys participate in its activities.

   Soldiers firing into the air burst
into the capital's leading hotel and detained opposition leaders
and foreign journalists after an anti-government demonstration was
smashed by authorities.
   The military confiscated the film of foreign television crews at
the Marriott Hotel, which has been used for weeks as an informal
headquarters by reporters and leaders of the National Civic Crusade.
   Opposition spokesmen said nearly 20 of their leaders were
detained. Eight foreign journalists, including Richard Cole of The
Associated Press, were taken away and held for about three hours.
   The Civic Crusade, a leading anti-government coalition, staged
the afternoon protest march in an attempt to force the ouster of
Panama's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Five
leaders of the march were arrested.
   The violence Monday coincided with the beginning of the second
week of a general strike that has closed down an estimated 90
percent of Panama's industry and commerce.
   Gunmen dressed in civilian clothes but believed to be members of
the Defense Forces's state security force, and helmeted soldiers
carrying assault rifles, swept into the Marriott about three hours
after the demonstration was put down.
   Directors of the Civic Crusade had just begun a meeting in an
office on the mezzanine floor when police and soldiers charged into
the lobby, firing handguns and rifles into the air.
   The opposition leaders dashed toward elevators and stairways.
But many were caught by the raiders, who sealed off the lobby and
searched the building floor by floor.
   The soldiers then forced their way into temporary offices of
NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN, among others. They ordered employees out of
the suites at gunpoint and searched the rooms, confiscating film of
the earlier demonstration and other equipment.
   A police officer on the scene who declined to identify himself
said about 40 people were taken away, including local and foreign
journalists.
   Cole, a reporter from the AP's Miami bureau, and the seven other
foreign reporters were released unharmed.
   ``We went there (to the hotel) to neutralize the crusade's
center of operations,'' Maj. Felipe Camargo later told Cole and the
other detained journalists.
   Among the crusade leaders arrested was Aurelio Barria, owner of
an import-export firm who helped found the movement 10 months ago.
Also taken were Raul Mendez and Manuel Burgos, both well-known
opposition figures.
   The other detained foreign reporters were Thomas Haley, a U.S.
photographer for a French photo agency; J.B. Diedrich, a
Miami-based photographer for an independent U.S. photo agency; and
five Mexicans, Abdiel Vivancos of ABC, Alfredo Gudinno of NBC,
Maria Cortina of Radio Mexicana and Jose Manuel Pintada and Eduardo
Herrera of Spanish Television.
   Cole said the reporters were packed in police vans and taken to
state security headquarters. There, he said, authorities searched
and interrogated them, photocopied their documents and notes and
told to line up facing a wall.
   Later the reporters were transferred to a baseball field where
about 40 other people, at least two of whom appeared to have been
beaten, were being processed by army officials.
   The foreign reporters were then separated from the other
detainees and Camargo told them their arrest was a mistake. They
were set free.
   Ed Rabel, an NBC correspondent, said seven Panamanian employees
of the network were among those taken into custody.
   Horst Sicher, the manager of the hotel, said he had no notice of
the raid.
   ``Frankly, I can't do anything about it,'' he said, watching
with chagrin as soldiers in combat gear rushed through his
establishment.
   Minutes after the assault, phone service at the hotel was cut.
   Earlier Monday, a crowd of about 10,000 cheering, singing
anti-government demonstrators marched toward the central business
district, ignoring an order to disperse. They had moved about half
a mile when soldiers suddenly attacked.
   A water cannon sped through the line of march spraying people
with a choking mixture of water and chemicals.
   Behind the truck charged police and soldiers firing birdshot and
beating people with 18-inch truncheons.
   Reporters saw several people hit by shotgun pellets and at least
two people trampled in the rush to escape police and soldiers.
There was no official account of injuries or arrests from the
demonstration, one of the largest in months.
   Jose Faundes, secretary of the Panamanian Human Rights
Commission, identified the five detained march leaders as Carlos
Gonzalez de la Lastra, Alberto Aleman, Roberto Aleman, Roberto Roy
and Frank Maurice.
   The United States has called for Noriega's ouster since he was
indicted in Florida in February on drug-trafficking charges. The
Defense Forces chief has said he is innocent.
   The Reagan administration has also imposed economic sanctions on
Panama and supported efforts by former President Eric Arturo
Delvalle to freeze Panama's deposits in U.S. banks.
   The cash-short government on Monday paid its lowest-paid retired
public servants living in Panama City and Colon, those whose
semi-monthly pension benefits come to $150 or less.
   Those living in other cities and other retirees were told they
would be paid later in the week. There was no official estimate of
how many got paid Monday.
   Banks were closed on March 3 after a run on deposits triggered
by the dismissal of Delvalle by the National Assembly, dominated by
Noriega supporters.

   Passengers apparently panicked at the sight of
flames on the wing of a Northwest Airlines jet and evacuated the
plane without waiting for instructions from the crew, officials
said Monday.
   The plane did not actually catch fire Sunday night, but the
incident closed Detroit Metropolitan Airport for 20 minutes, and
four passengers were hurt sliding down the emergency chutes,
authorities said.
   ``I think the unfortunate thing here is that the passengers in
confusion initiated the escape exit without being ordered to do so
by the captain,'' FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said. ``And of
course we'd like to see that the captain be able to call the shots
in this regard.''
   The plane was carrying 144 passengers and seven crew members
from San Diego, Calif.
   ``It appears at this time that it was a spontaneous evacuation
(by passengers) at the time of the flash,'' said Northwest William
Wren.
   Wren described the fire as a flash caused by residual fuel. It
occurred in the right wing and probably lasted only a second or
less, he said. The plane returned to service Monday, he added.
   Such a flareup is not unheard of, and ``it's not as dangerous as
one might think if handled properly,'' said McArtor, who happened
to be in Detroit on Monday for a speech.
   Wren said Northwest had not interviewed crew members but that
the passengers, rather than the crew, apparentlty initiated the
evacuation.
   ``That needs to be the call of the captain,'' McArtor said. ``We
simply would like the crew to be able to initiate that sequence of
events.''
   ``Naturally we would like to find out more about this,'' he said.
   FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said the pilot was alerted about
the flareup and triggered an automatic device that extinguished the
flash.
   A 64-year-old woman whose name was not released was listed in
good condition Monday at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak,
suffering from trauma and knee and elbow injuries.
   The other injured passengers were treated at another hospital
for cuts and bruises and released.
   Passenger Mike Young of Toledo said he popped open an emergency
exit as panic spread through the plane, and he and his wife climbed
onto the wing.
   ``We thought about jumping, but when the flames died down, we
thought it might be too dangerous,'' Young said.
   Other passengers said flight attendants jumped up to help with
the evacuation. ``They helped calm everyone down,'' Carolyn
Reinhardt of Marlton, N.J., told The News of Detroit.

   Three prison escapees including a triple
murderer were captured Sunday night in a stolen car after four days
of freedom in which they found a gun and allegedly committed a
robbery, authorities say.
   No one was injured when the car in which the three were riding
was surrounded by law enforcement officers outside this town, said
Mason County sheriff's Lt. Howard Armsfield. He said a handgun was
stuffed under the seat of the car.
   The three escaped Wednesday night from the Washington
Corrections Center in Shelton, about 15 miles northwest of Olympia
in western Washington, authorities said.
   They apparently had been hiding in a shed near a home about
three miles from the prison, Armsfield said.
   Armed with a gun they found in the shed, the three confronted
the people who lived in the house on Sunday afternoon, robbed them
of a few dollars and stole their auto, he said.
   Armsfield said he did not have additional details of the
robbery. Mason County Sheriff Bob Holter said earlier he believed
the residents were unharmed.
   The convicts first drove off in a pickup truck, and abandoned it
and another stolen car before seizing the car in which they were
captured, Armsfield said.
   One of the escapees, Sean Stevenson, 17, was convicted of
murdering his mother, stepfather and sister. He went to prison June
20 on a sentence of life without possibility of parole.
   With him were Gary Curtis Van Winkle, 17, convicted of attempted
murder and burglary, and Patrick J. Rice, 23, convicted of 10
counts of second-degree burglary and one count of taking a motor
vehicle without permission.
   The three escaped after apparently scaling a chain link fence
topped with three feet of razor-sharp ``ribbon wire'' at a point
close to an unoccupied prison guard tower, said Corrections
Department spokeswoman Barbara Lovelace.

   A Northwest Airlines jet was evacuated
Sunday night when residual fuel vapors briefly ignited, causing
what witnesses thought to be a fire, authorities said.
   Four passengers were injured slightly while evacuating the
Boeing 727 jetliner shortly after it landed at 8:20 p.m., and the
incident forced the airport to close for about 20 minutes,
according to Northwest and airport spokesmen.
   Flight 288, originating in San Diego, Calif., with 144
passengers and seven crew members aboard, landed routinely at
Metropolitan Airport, Northwest spokesman William Wren said.
   ``Residual fuel in the exhaust system of the auxiliary power
unit produced a flash that caused evacuation of the aircraft as the
aircraft awaited clearance to taxi to the terminal,'' Wren said in
a prepared statement.
   The flash was sighted at the plane's right wing, where the
residual fuel is exhausted, Wren said.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Chicago, said the flash was sighted by a
controller in the airport tower, passengers aboard Flight 288 and
by people aboard another plane taxiing behind the Northwest
aircraft.
   The pilot of Flight 288 was alerted and triggered an automatic
device that extinguished the flash, Edelstein said. By that time,
he said, the plane had been evacuated and airport firefighters were
summoned.
   But, Edelstein said, ``By the time the fire department got
there, there was no visible evidence of a fire.'' An initial FAA
examination of the plane revealed no burned parts or other signs of
an actual fire, he said.
   The auxiliary power unit runs the aircraft's electrical, air
conditioning and other systems while it is on the ground and
operates separately from the engines, Wren said.
   The four injured passengers were treated at Annapolis Hospital,
mainly for cuts and bruises suffered while sliding down evacuation
chutes, nursing supervisor Barbara Morrow said.

   ``Dallas'' star Larry Hagman says that 10 years
after the television series began, double-dealing oilman J.R. Ewing
still has a few years of treachery and lechery left.
   ``I would have thought by now `Dallas' would have petered out
somewhat. But I hope we get a couple more years out of it,'' Hagman
said in an article in this week's People magazine.
   ``I know a lot of TV actors get trapped in a hit show,'' said
Hagman, who first brought J.R. to life April 2, 1978, on CBS-TV.
``Maybe I'm lazy, but I'm happy doing what I'm doing.
   But Hagman, 56, said even J.R. can't live forever.
   ``Sooner or later `Dallas will ride off into the sunset, just
like everything else. But whatever happens, I know what I want on
J.R.'s tombstone. It should say: `Here lies upright citizen J.R.
Ewing. This is the only deal he ever lost.'''

   Bernice A. King, daughter of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., has become the first of the third
generation of Kings licensed to preach at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   ``It almost makes you believe preaching is hereditary,'' said
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a Congregational minister who worked
with her father. ``So many of her mannerisms and so much of her
style is so much like her daddy, it was a very emotional occasion
for me.''
   Miss King's grandfather, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., was
pastor of Ebenezer for 44 years until his death in 1984. Her
grandmother, Alberta Williams King, was church organist until she
was shot to death at the keyboard June 30, 1974.
   Her father was associate pastor until he was assassinated in
1968. His funeral was at Ebenezer.
   After her sermon Sunday, which used the story of Zaccheus to
exhort the congregation to rise above the crowd, Miss King, 25, was
awarded a license to preach by Ebenezer pastor Joseph Roberts.
   When she completes her five-year study program at Emory
University and is called to a particular ministry, Miss King will
be ordained as a minister and may perform all the sacraments of the
church.

from birth defects and she wondered ``Why them?''
   ``In order to make progress we had to ask, `Why them?''' Ms.
Sills, who chairs the March of Dimes' 50th anniversary celebration,

   Ms. Sills, now general director of the New York City Opera, said
in the Sunday edition of The Tennessean that she and her husband,
Peter Greenough, never asked ``Why me?''
   ```Why me?' is a lot of self-pity. `Why them?' is a genuine
desire to see that it doesn't happen to others. It helps you
concentrate and move on,'' she said.
   The couple's daughter, Meredith Greenough, 28, is deaf, and son,
Peter Greenough Jr., 26, is autistic, retarded and epileptic.

   Steven Tyler, lead singer for the rock
group Aerosmith, says he never realized his life would reflect his
1973 song lyrics: ``you got to lose to win.''
   ``I didn't even know what I was writing at the time,'' Tyler
said of the song ``Dream On'' in a newspaper interview published
Sunday.
   ``But it's true, you have to get on the bottom to appreciate
what you've got,'' Tyler told The Tennessean.
   In the 1973 hit song, Tyler sang:
   ``I know nobody knows
   ``Where it comes or where it goes
   ``I know everybody says
   ``You got to lose to win.''
   Aerosmith's 1975 album ``Toys in the Attic'' sold four million
copies and singles including ``Walk This Way'' and ``Sweet
Emotion'' were hits. But the band's success led to a downward
spiral that began with drugs and led to the group's disintegration,
Tyler said.
   The five original members reunited in 1984, and this year they
staged a comeback with ``Dude (Looks Like a Lady)'' and three other
Top 10 singles on their ``Permanent Vacation'' album.

   Billy Carter, the outspoken younger brother of
former President Jimmy Carter, says he has returned to religion and
hasn't had a beer since 1979.
   Carter, 51, was diagnosed in September as having pancreatic
cancer, a disease fatal to more than 95 percent of its victims. His
sister Ruth and his father both died of pancreatic cancer.
   But Carter remains hopeful after a bile-duct operation at Emory
University in Atlanta and six weeks of radiation and chemotherapy.
   ``We'll know in a couple of months,'' he told People magazine in
an article published this week. ``Whatever is going to come is
going to come.''
   In the meantime, he spends his days at his home in Plains, Ga.,
and has resolved to just ``live a normal life and do what I want to
do.'' He plays Scrabble with his wife and bones up on the World
Almanac ``so my children will think I'm smart.''

   Lawmakers from areas where Japanese imports
threaten to cut into jobs are coming down with a case of the
blue-collar blues over changes they say will water down their
sweeping trade bill.
   ``I don't see why we should be pulling all the teeth out of our
bill out of fear of a presidential veto,'' says Rep. Donald J.
Pease, D-Ohio.
   The concerns are surfacing as a House-Senate conference
committee prepares to meet Tuesday to begin thrashing out what
lawmakers are calling the ``cosmic issues'' still remaining in the
debate, such as retaliation against foreign trade barriers.
   The conference committee is seeking to reach a compromise
between rival House and Senate versions of the 1,000-page trade
bill, a massive attempt to solve a massive problem _ record U.S.
trade deficits and related layoffs in some U.S. industries.
   President Reagan's repeated veto threats are raising anxieties
on Capitol Hill and may have prompted efforts by Senate conferees
to tone down the measure in hope of winning administration support.
   Some of the most stringent provisions, such as Democratic
presidential hopeful Richard A. Gephardt's plan for retaliation if
Japanese trade surpluses don't fall 10 percent per year, have long
been opposed by the administration.
   Reagan says they could lead to counterattacks on American farm
goods and other exports, cost more jobs than they would save and
hurt consumers by narrowing the choice of goods on the shelf and
raising prices.
   Some lawmakers from the nation's hard-hit heavy industrial belt,
however, say Senate attempts to minimize Reagan's objections could
throw away the best of a three-year effort to produce ``tough trade
legislation.''
   ``The conference on the trade bill is like a Diet Coke when you
take away the sugar and you take away the caffeine and all you have
left is the bubbles,'' says Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., a House
conferee.
   ``I think the president and his people are not fools,'' says
Pease, also a conferee. ``They know that trade deficits are very
large. They know that trade is a political issue this year, so I
think the president is likely to sign a trade bill that we send him
this year. He may grumble but he'll sign it.''
   Guarini points to a plan he devised under which the government
would step up monitoring to find out what foreign companies are
``dumping'' products in the U.S. market at prices slashed below
those charged to consumers at home. The practice is illegal under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Both House and Senate versions of the bill contained a
monitoring provision, but the latest Senate proposal would wipe
them both out.
   ``That's a strange way to compromise,'' says Guarini.
   Pease is smarting from a Senate move to strike provisions
designed to expand the definition of unfair trade practices by
including such issues as foreign companies' and governments' denial
of collective bargaining rights to their industrial workers.
   Pease is especially concerned that the Senate proposal would
wipe out some causes of retaliatory action already appearing in
U.S. trade law, among them denial of market access to American
companies.
   Other House conferees grumbling over the possibility of diluting
the bill include Reps. Marty Russo, D-Ill., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.,
the latter an outspoken champion of the hard-hit textile industry.
   Senate Finance Committee members who drew up the proposals are
understandably impatient with these complaints.
   ``We're trying to write a bill that's in the 20th century,''
says Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., ``We don't want a petrified bill
stuck in the past.''
   Itemizing every possible unfair trade practice merely runs the
risk of leaving something out and then having it used against
American companies, Baucus says. The problem of repeat dumping
offenders is taken care of by other provisions of the bill, he adds.
   Over the last few weeks, House and Senate conferees have not
been meeting face to face but instead communicating through
messages sent back and forth between the two wings of the Capitol.
   The meeting Tuesday will be the first in-person confrontation
and because of the friction between the two sides, it almost
certainly will take place behind closed doors.
   ``We're getting down to the cosmic issues,'' Rep. William
Frenzel, R-Minn., told reporters. ``We have to do that face to
face.''

   Jesse Jackson's win in Michigan has sent a
message to the Democratic Party that it can no longer ignore _ at
the rate he's going, Jackson just might wind up as its presidential
nominee this fall.
   Political analysts say Jackson's almost 2-1 victory over
erstwhile front-runner Michael Dukakis in Saturday's Michigan
caucuses is a clear signal that the preacher-turned-politician is a
very viable contender for the nomination.
   Jackson, treated as an also-ran in 1984, has won in eight states
so far this year _ Michigan, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Virginia, South Carolina, Alaska _ and in Puerto
Rico's non-binding contest.
   The string of victories is forcing the party to re-examine the
theory that a black cannot be nominated for president in 1988.
   ``The Democratic voters are sending a very strong message to the
party,'' said Ann Lewis, a Democratic strategist and informal
adviser to the Jackson campaign. ``The quality of leadership is
something they like and admire. This is a referendum on him and a
referendum he's winning.''
   The campaign-watchers also said the Michigan win could translate
into victories in other high-stakes contests, including the New
York primary on April 19.
   ``I don't believe Dukakis can stop him,'' said David Garth, a
New York media consultant who is working for Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr.'s campaign, ``unless something different happens.''
   New York, which has 255 delegates at stake, represents a serious
challenge for Dukakis, who has failed in the major industrial
states of Illinois and Michigan.
   ``The stakes could not be more critical,'' said Paul Maslin,
pollster for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's campaign. ``He can't just
finish second to Jesse Jackson. He can't say I'm the leading white
candidate. It's not going to work this year.
   ``Dukakis has got to win big to even say `This is the guy the
party wants,''' Garth said.
   A New York Daily News poll published Sunday showed Dukakis
favored by 45 percent of the 528 Democrats surveyed to 29 percent
for Jackson. The poll, conducted between Monday, March 21 and
Thursday, March 24, had a margin for error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.
   However, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has said that if two or three
candidates are left in the Democratic race prior to the primary,
Jackson has a chance of winning.
   A poll by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found
that 57 percent of 459 Democratic voters surveyed in New York
earlier this month gave Jackson a favorable rating, to 30 percent
unfavorable. In a survey by the same group in January, only 44
percent had given Jackson a favorable rating while 41 percent rated
him unfavorably.
   ``New York is a fairly volatile state,'' Garth said. He noted
thatg the state has a large Jewish vote, a group that has been
skeptical of Jackson in the past.
   In the most recent Marist College survey, 36 percent of the
Jewish voters gave Jackson a favorable rating, an increase from 17
percent in January. Forty-three percent gave Jackson an unfavorable
rating compared to 62 percent in January. The results had a margin
of error of 5 percentage points.
   The numbers suggest Jackson is mending fences with Jews whom he
offended in 1984.
   ``There are still some in the political establishment who think
1988 is an inevitable replay of 1984,'' Ms. Lewis said. But, she
added, ``The day after Michigan a new world has dawned.''

   One aspect of Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy's past that Senate investigators apparently missed was his
high school absenteeism.
   Kennedy, who joined the court Feb. 18, ``confessed'' while
discussing his childhood in Sacramento, Calif., during a recent
interview with the court's ``Docket Sheet'' publication.
   ``My dad was a lawyer, a great lawyer and I wanted to follow
him,'' the justice said. ``He was a sole practitioner and he used
to take me with him to hear him try his cases. He didn't think
school was very important; he would take me.
   ``Even in high school, he'd say, `We have to go now, we're going
for two weeks for a trial.' I would just leave school because he
would insist that I go with him. I probably saw 10 trials before I
was ever out of high school. I loved it.''
   No word in yet on Kennedy's truancy as a Stanford undergraduate
or as a Harvard law student.

<HEAD>Kennedy Mum on Key Disqualification</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The court last week cited a lack of a quorum in refusing to kill
a lawsuit stemming from an armed confrontation between Indians and
federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D.
   Four justices, including Kennedy, disqualified themselves from
the case, and the remaining five justices automatically upheld a
lower court ruling that clears the way for a trial in which former
federal and military officials are named as defendants.
   Three members _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor _ had disqualified
themselves when the case was granted review, before Kennedy joined
the court. His disqualification came as something of a surprise.
   His office informed reporters that as a rule, Kennedy will not

<HEAD>Fall Preview: Experts Say Attack Ads Will Return _ With A Twist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``attack ads'' of Super Tuesday have given
way to a gentler spring, but experts say the most pointed jabs of
the presidential primary season will be back this fall _ with a new
twist.
   ``History tells us that we're likely going to see Democrats
being quoted against the Democratic nominee and Republicans quoted
against the Republican nominee both in advertising and in
speeches,'' says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, author of two books on
political campaigns and advertising. ``It's a classic move and this
year both sides are vulnerable.''
   The outbreak of tough television talk started in New Hampshire,
when Sen. Paul Simon questioned Rep. Richard Gephardt's consistency
and Vice President George Bush dubbed Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole
``Senator Straddle.''
   The negativity was contagious. By Super Tuesday on March 8,
almost all of the candidates had been both victims and perpetrators
of attack ads by their intra-party rivals _ their determination to
survive the 20 contests that day stronger than any long-term
concerns about the fall.
   ``When the others keep attacking you and it's going to cost
votes, there's no choice but to fire back and worry about the
consequences at a later date,'' says Dan Payne, a media adviser to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Some people are lucky. Bush's offhand remark in 1980 about
Ronald Reagan's ``voodoo economics'' didn't keep him off the ticket
and didn't keep the ticket from winning.
   But Jamieson said that was because Jimmy Carter didn't use the
remark effectively. ``It could have been much more damaging than it
was, but the Democrats didn't take advantage of it,'' she said.
   Pre-convention squabbles have played a significant role in
several recent elections. Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan won in 1964, 1972 and 1980 at least partly because they
reminded voters of what had been said about their opponents in
contested primaries.
   In 1964, Jamieson said, Johnson reiterated the charges that
George Romney, Nelson Rockefeller and William Scranton had made
against Barry Goldwater. In 1972, Nixon's most effective ads
against George McGovern ``simply repeated the attacks Hubert
Humphrey made against McGovern,'' she said.
   And in 1980, Jamieson said, one Reagan campaign ad showed Sen.
Edward Kennedy chanting something to the effect of ``no more high
interest rates, no more high inflation, no more Jimmy Carter.''
   It's an attractive strategy because it minimizes any backlash
against the nominee. He can quote what others have said without
going on the attack himself, remaining in more of what author
Stephen Hess calls ``the presidential mode.''
   Once nominated, ``they want to be perceived more as statesmen
than as politicians and it's less attractive to them to be in the
mudslinging business,'' said Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution and author of a book called ``The Presidential
Campaign.''
   Thus nominee Bush, if he felt so inclined, could undermine
Dukakis by citing Gephardt's attacks on him as a tax-raiser and a
city guy who thinks destitute farmers can get rich growing Belgian
endive.
   The Democrats, for their part, have a wealth of material against
Bush, much of it compliments of Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York. Kemp went after the vice president on taxes and Social
Security while Dole ads questioned Bush's leadership ability and
his judgment in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The same issues also came up in debates. The Democrats will have
access to scenes of Bush's pugnacious rivals demanding explanations
of his Iran-Contra role and how he has distinguished himself in the
past seven years.
   ``Any front-runner right now that isn't collecting tapes of the
debates is foolish. They're a gold mine,'' said Jamieson.
   The ammunition provided by primary opponents can be especially
useful in drawing disaffected voters who had supported someone
other than their party nominee. ``It's a powerful reminder'' of
what they initially disliked about the nominee and a strong
inducement to cross party lines in the general election, Jamieson
said.
   There's no guarantee these tactics will work. If both sides
point to what opponents said in a primary, the effect may be a
wash. If the nominees borrow too liberally from the remarks of
others, voters may end up confused by the cross fire.
   And then there are the tests of time and relevance. By the
conventions this summer, will voters remember the Dukakis
campaign's 1987 ``attack video'' against Sen. Joseph Biden? Will
they care about the Gephardt ad accusing Dukakis of smearing Biden?
   Political analysts say it's unlikely. The high-water mark of
negative advertising was probably reached on Super Tuesday and no
one, they say, has come up with anything as potentially damaging as
``voodoo economics'' or ``Where's the beef?'' Walter Mondale's 1984
question of Gary Hart.
   ``If it's not worse than voodoo economics, it probably doesn't
hurt,'' said Democratic consultant Bob Squier.
   Squier and others pointed to the developing Iran-Contra
situation as a bigger headache for Bush than anything the Democrats
have said about each other thus far.
   And while it will be nice for the Democrats to be able to quote
Dole, Squier said they won't have to be nearly as circumspect.
   ``Dole had to make his attack on a sitting vice president but he
had to shoot around the president,'' he said. ``We Democrats won't
have that problem.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon said all he expected in
Michigan's Democratic presidential caucuses was a respectable
showing.
   He got 2 percent. But aides put the best face on even that.
   They said the results, while far from what Simon wanted, made
his strategy of expending little effort in Michigan and focusing on
the Wisconsin primary more important than ever.
   Simon was saying after Michigan what he's been saying for weeks
now _ that the Democratic race is so muddled that he's got as much
right as anyone to hang in there.
   ``We're clearly headed toward a wide-open convention,'' Simon
said.
   Jesse Jackson's victory over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
in Michigan increased Simon's attractiveness as an alternative,
said Chris Sautter, the Illinois senator's Wisconsin campaign
coordinator.
   ``Now, we're in a position where we can be considered a serious
contender here,'' Sautter said Sunday. ``It underscores the whole
idea of an open convention.''
   Simon acknowledges, though, that Wisconsin's primary, a week
from Tuesday, is a key test.
   ``In a state like Wisconsin, where politics is synonymous with
the word `progressive,' we have the opportunity to communicate that
the Democrats don't have to settle for a weak alternative,''
campaign spokesman Terry Michael said. ``We need to make that case
in Wisconsin.''
   What happens if Simon loses?
   ``We have to reassess at that point,'' Michael said.
   Even longtime supporters said Simon must win in Wisconsin or
think seriously about abandoning his quest for the White House.
   ``The big questions are whether his campaign after Wisconsin is
credible and raising money,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. ``If
the answer to those two things is `yes,' he'll be pressing
forward.''
   Simon's only victory so far was at home in the Illinois primary.
   He has placed third, fourth or fifth in most other primaries and
caucuses, sat out Super Tuesday races in 20 states and ranks fifth
among five candidates in delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in July.
   ``He's by no means out of it, and I'm sticking with him as long
as he wants to stay in,'' said Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., voicing
sentiments of aides speaking for Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, and
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Yet Evans hedged when asked if he thinks Simon still has a
chance of becoming the Democratic nominee.
   ``It's very hard to say what's going to happen,'' Evans said.
``Strange things happen occasionally at conventions.''
   Other allies, though, said they have counseled Simon against
hurting his chances for re-election to the Senate by clinging to a
hopeless cause.
   ``I think he will continue to look at it as long as he doesn't
incur more debt,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., one of those who
urged Simon to bypass the Super Tuesday states.
   `You don't want to have a big debt when you're looking at
1990,'' Dixon said. ``I can't tell you what his present financial
shape is. But it's hoped he can walk away from this thing pretty
much as a wash.''
   Simon has repaid more than a half-million dollars' worth of bank
loans and he expects to use 20 staff members and spend $100,000 for
television advertising in the Wisconsin campaign, spokesman Michael
said.

<HEAD>Broccoli Battle as States Vie for Trendy Veggie Dominance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California is in a broccoli race with other
parts of the country where farmers seek crops more profitable than
the traditional harvests of wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans.
   An Agriculture Department report by Roberta Cook of the
University of California, Davis, says cauliflower has joined
broccoli as a favorite among the veggie expansionists.
   ``Between 1978 and 1986, harvested acreage of broccoli increased
by 90 percent, while the number of states producing for the fresh
market grew from the traditional four (California, Texas, Oregon
and Arizona) to include new producers such as Maine, North and
South Carolina, New York, Illinois, Virginia, Oklahoma and
Colorado,'' she said.
   The expansion is explained by the rapidly growing popularity of
fresh vegetables in the American diet and by the declining
profitability of food and feed grains in the 1980s.
   ``Unfortunately, the capacity of the fruit and vegetable
industry to absorb the additional acreage is limited,'' Ms. Cook
said.
   That is because there are more than 200 million acres in the
United States used to produce grain, compared with only about 5
million acres of fruit and vegetables.
   ``Consequently, while shifting 2.5 percent of grain acreage into
fruits and vegetables would not solve the excess supply problem in
grains, it would double fruit and vegetable acreage and devastate
prices,'' she said. ``At the same time, other regions of the world,
particularly Mexico and the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries
are expanding vegetable exports to the United States.''
   California remains the dominant broccoli producer, with its area
increasing to 106,400 acres in 1986 from 64,400 in 1978. However,
California's share of the total U.S. broccoli acreage declined from
a high of 96 percent in 1979 to 82 percent in 1986.
   The California market share of broccoli production also dropped
during the 1978-86 period from 96 percent to 91 percent.
   There has also been a rise in cauliflower production, with the
harvested area rising 65 percent between 1978 and 1986, Ms. Cook
said. Fresh market cauliflower production increased even more, to
more than 5.9 million hundredweight in 1986 from 1.85 million in
1978.
   California's market share of fresh market cauliflower increased
to 79 percent of the total in 1986 from 74 percent in 1978.
   Although California has a climatic advantage during portions of
the year, the competition in other states during the summer and
fall has become significant.
   ``The combined fall broccoli area in the Midwest, South and East
amounts to an estimated 10,000 acres, compared with 28,000 acres in
California,'' Ms. Cook said. ``Hence, this new broccoli acreage
compares to 35 percent of California acreage when viewed on a
seasonal basis.''
   Meanwhile, imports of fresh vegetables have increased sharply
since 1978. Despite the growth, however, she said broccoli imports
still represent only about 1 percent of the total U.S. supply,
while cauliflower imports make up about 2 percent of the supply.
   Mexico is the leading source of fresh broccoli imports, and
Canada is the largest provider of imported cauliflower.
   ``However, both Canada's and Mexico's share of the import market
has declined slightly while other exporting countries, including
Guatemala, Jamaica, Chile, Belgium, France and Israel have
gained,'' Ms. Cook said.

   A four-year experiment to control houseflies
with tiny parastic wasps and special traps is near an end, perhaps
paving the way for use by consumers generally, says the Agriculture
Department.
   Richard Miller of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said the traps were used last year by a Laurel, Md., resident, Paul
Schwartz, whose home is next to a horse farm. Flies bred in manure
and straw bedding were a problem. It was impossible to eat outside
because of the flies.
   Last summer, the experimental traps reduced the flies by an
estimated 90 percent, Schwartz said.
   Miller, whose work was reported recently by the agency, said
houseflies can be major irritants in areas where many new houses
are being built near farms. And they're a nuisance to farmers and
livestock, too.
   The trap is painted white to attract the flies, and a sticky
coating nabs them once they land. Miller said that while there is
interest in the pyramid traps, none is yet being produced
commercially.
   Miller said the tiny wasp, Muscidifurax raptor, is a biological
control alternative to chemical sprays. The wasps are found
throughout the United States and are natural enemies of the flies,
while being harmless to humans. The wasps lay eggs in the fly
pupae, which are killed as the wasps develop.
   ``These parasites are reared by the thousands and released to
maintain or augment natural (wasp) populations,'' Miller said. ``In
last year's test we increased the wasp populations up to tenfold.''
   Later, he said, traps were used to capture the surviving flies.

<HEAD>New Fishing Methods Spread to Poor Countries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Research Council is out to prove
the Chinese proverb: ``Give a man a fish and you feed him once;
teach him how to fish and you feed him for life.''
   The council has seized on the idea _ an oft-quoted aphorism in
foreign aid circles _ and come up with a lot of ideas, from
pedal-power fishing craft more efficient than rowboats to
artificial mangrove branches made of aluminum wire bathed in
concrete. The fake branches provide the kind of surface that baby
oysters like to hang on, useful in places where cutting mangroves
is illegal.
   The council has recently published a book-length manual of
low-price fishing methods, called ``Fishing Technologies for
Developing Countries.'' It's not for big commercial fleets but for
traditional fishermen who account for a quarter of the world's
catch, about 20 million tons a year. They provide most of the fish
in Africa and Asia, but a much smaller proportion in Latin America.
   An estimated 200 million people depend on them.
   First thing most fishermen need is a boat. The high quality
hardwoods many peoples traditionally use have become dearer and
harder to find. Plywood is not too expensive, and plywood
catamarans developed in Western Samoa have lasted almost a decade.
Plastic tubes and ferro-concrete are ugly, but cheap and durable.
   The Japanese have found another use for six-inch plastic tubes.
Two of them, 30 inches long, are laid side by side with a two-inch
concrete plug that bisects them: the result offers four fatal dens
to unsuspecting octopi.
   In Venezuela they make octopus pots from old rubber tires.
   A boat has to move. Sailing has declined among Third World
fishermen in recent years, the council says, and instead there have
been ideas for cheap fuel: alcohol made from cassava (manioc) in
Fiji, coconut oil for mixing with diesel fuel in the Philippines.
The coconut oil clogged the fuel filters, and the Filipinos have
been trying to use charcoal from coconut shells to make gas for
fuel.
   Several ideas, some more effective, have come from the
Philippines. The academy says a system for cultured mussels
developed at Sapian Bay, on the island of Panay, uses rope-webs
floated from rafts instead of the more usual stakes driven into the
mud. It raised mussel production to more than five times the old
method.
   Advanced technology need not be too expensive, the council
points out. Fish are sensitive to the temperature of the water, and
move when it changes. A shift of one degree or even less can
indicate a place where fish may cluster. Ordinary thermometers are
not sensitive enough, but a simple electronic thermometer can show
differences of a tenth of a degree and cost less than $100.

   The Federal Reserve has been trying to keep
the economic recovery alive following the October stock market
collapse, but many economists believe it is starting to worry more
about rising inflationary pressures.
   These analysts think the switch will mean that interest rates,
including mortgage rates, will not fall further and actually will
climb slightly in coming months.
   The central bank's top policy makers will meet behind closed
doors Tuesday to review monetary strategy. The decisions made by
the Federal Open Market Committee will not be revealed until
mid-May.
   While analysts are not looking for major policy changes to come
out of the meeting, they said recent comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan indicate that the central bank has begun to
worry once again about inflationary pressures.
   The central bank tries to balance the competing economic goals
of supplying enough money to the financial system to keep the
economy expanding while guarding against supplying so much money
that inflation is rekindled.
   In congressional testimony earlier this month, Greenspan said he
was worried that inflationary bottlenecks could develop in U.S.
industries later this year.
   Greenspan said there were no signs of inflationary troubles at
present, but that the central bank would act fast at the first sign
that the economy was overheating. For the Fed, fighting inflation
means raising interest rates.
   Before the Oct. 19 collapse of stock prices, the Fed had been
tightening credit conditions out of fear that a weaker dollar would
increase U.S. inflation.
   But following the record 508-point drop in stock prices, the
central bank moved quickly to ease credit in order to keep the
country out of a recession.
   Analysts said they believed Greenspan's recent comments were an
indication the central bank is once again switching gears.
   ``I am not looking for any more interest rate declines. I think
the Fed is worried again about inflation,'' said David Seiders,
chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
   Mortgage rates, which hit a high of 11.58 percent immediately
before the stock crash last October, dipped into single-digits
earlier this year, falling to 9.84 percent in early February.
   But in recent weeks rates have been rising again, averaging 9.99
percent last week, according to a nationwide survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Seiders predicted that mortgage rates could top 11 percent by
the end of the year. Other analysts agreed that a variety of
interest rates would likely head higher in coming months,
especially if economic growth rebounds.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co., said he
believed the central bank would make no outright change in policy
at its March meeting but would stand ready to tighten credit
conditions later in the year.
   ``If the economy picks up steam and produces inflationary
pressures, I wouldn't rule out a tightening move later this
spring,'' he said. ``The central bank is making people aware that
if inflation does heat up, they would tighten.''
   Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said he expected mortgage rates to fluctuate between
10 percent to 10.5 percent over the next two months as the Fed
watches for further indications of how the economy is performing.
   One key indicator the Fed will be watching is the monthly
unemployment report. The jobless rate dropped to an 8{-year low of
5.7 percent in February and Greenspan indicated that it was
unlikely the rate could fall much farther without triggering
inflationary pressures.
   ``If economic growth is too strong, the unemployment rate could
drop down into a danger zone which would generate an upturn in wage
increases,'' said Gramley, a former member of the Fed board. ``Once
you get that under way, it is very hard to stop and even harder to
reverse. That is what you want to avoid if you can.''
   Some economists said that the Fed would hold off making any
major change in direction until late next month when the government
releases its first estimate of overall economic growth, as measured
by the gross national product, for the January-March quarter.
   Roger Brinner, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said that
if growth was really weak in the first quarter, the Fed might be
persuaded that a further dose of easing was needed, especially
since this is a presidential election year.

   Houston has suffered low oil prices, a troubled
space program and the near-exodus of its pro football team. Now it
wants to avoid another hit: the departure of superstar
superconductivity physicist Paul Chu.
   ``I think we need to be sure we don't drop the ball,'' says City
Councilman Jim Greenwood. ``It's probably more important to keep
Paul Chu as it was to keep the Houston Oilers.''
   Superconductivity, the potential of some materials to carry
electricity without energy loss, has become one of the hottest
areas in science today. And Chu, a 47-year-old University of
Houston physics professor, has become one of the hottest
researchers in superconductivity.
   The research promises to spawn tremendous advances in industry,
with applications in computers, transmission of electricity and
transportation, although many observers feel it will be decades
before any significant commercial products result.
   Early last year, Chu announced that his experiments with
materials showed evidence of superconductivity at temperatures
warmer than ever before achieved. The discovery brought
energy-saving practical applications within closer range.
   The news spread quickly and made Chu an overnight celebrity in
scientific circles. Job offers began rolling in. One university has
promised him a $20 million research package if he moves there, said
Chu, who isn't naming the school.
   The rumors have prompted Houston businessman Tom Wright to
organize a letter-writing campaign asking small business owners to
urge Chu to stay.
   ``We should go out of our way to make sure he likes it here,''
Wright said. ``Wherever major discoveries are made, industry grows
around it. ... In my mind, superconductivity will be bigger to this
area than NASA ever was.''
   Chu says he has made no decision, but is considering an offer
from the University of California-Berkeley. On March 6, the San
Francisco Examiner reported Chu had accepted a teaching and
research post there, and Berkeley officials continue to claim Chu
has taken the job.
   ``We are expecting him to come to Berkeley this fall,'' said
Geoffrey Chew, Berkeley's dean of physical sciences. ``He came here
last week, and confirmed that he had accepted the offer.''
   In recent weeks, Chu has not responded to numerous interview
requests. Through his secretary, Mike Albert, he says he remains
undecided.
   ``Paul has been agonizing over this decision for about a year
now,'' Roy Weinstein, dean of the University of Houston college of
Natural Sciences and Mathematics, said last week.
   Among the attractions of Berkeley for Chu are the university's
prestige, the favorable California weather and the closer proximity
to family members who live in California, Weinstein said.
   Since his major discovery, Chu has been appointed to the newly
created T.L.L. Temple Chair at the University of Houston, funded by
a $1.5 million endowment. His salary has been raised and he has
been named director of the Texas Center of Superconductivity at
University of Houston, a $30 million research unit to be built at
the university.
   ``I think that the superconductivity center is more important to
him than anything else,'' said University of Houston President
Richard Van Horn. ``We have perhaps more people working in
superconductivity than anywhere else.''
   Houston's relatively undiversified energy-based economy was hit
hard by the 1986 fall of oil prices. And operations of the nation's
space program, and the nearby Johnson Space Center here, came to a
virtual halt with the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   The city's confidence was further battered last year by the near
departure of the Houston Oilers to Jacksonville, Fla. The team
eventually signed a 10-year lease to remain in Houston.
   Weinstein says he believes Chu will split his time between
California and Houston, but says the strain of such an arrangement
may be difficult for the quiet researcher.
   ``It's a question of whether he can do it,'' Weinstein said.
``He will have to confront it, test it, and see.''

<HEAD>Wright Promises to Work with GOP on Contra Aid</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: time of meeting uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   House Speaker Jim Wright is pledging to work
with the Republican leadership to produce a humanitarian aid
package for the Contra rebels, saying the amount of money involved
isn't ``a serious stumbling block.''
   ``Together, we'll work it out,'' the speaker said of his planned
negotiations with House GOP leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   Today's talks come in the wake of the preliminary cease-fire
agreement last week between the Contras and the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua, which allows the rebels to remain armed
and in the field while entering political talks with the government.
   Earlier this year, House Democrats beat back President Reagan's
request for a package of weapons and ammunition for the Contras,
saying it would interfere with the peace process. Then, Republicans
sided with a few Democratic opponents of any Contra aid to defeat
the House leadership's alternative plan for $30 million in strictly
``humanitarian'' assistance _ food, clothing and the like.
   As a result, U.S. aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29. Wright is
still supporting humanitarian aid, and this time he wants to ensure
GOP backing for the proposal.
   The speaker, whose high-profile role in the Central American
peace process has upset some administration officials, declined in
an interview Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' to specify the
amount of humanitarian aid he envisions.
   ``I have one, but I'm going to be amenable enough to listen to
Bob Michel and others. I don't think the dollar figure is a serious
stumbling block,'' he said.
   The speaker did not express any opposition to a provision in the
package guaranteeing a speedy vote on military aid if the peace
process breaks down, but he said triggering such a vote should be a
``collaborative'' decision by both Congress and the White House.
   Last week, Wright said the aid package should include food,
clothing and medical assistance for the Contras. Also last week,
Michel said he had discussed a $48 million, one-year aid package
that provided an expedited vote on further aid in June.
   Wright, reminded of Congress' refusal to send military aid to
the rebels, was asked if the Soviets should be required to end
their support to the Nicaraguan government.
   ``I think it's high time that we do sit down with the Soviet
Union and hammer that out,'' Wright said. ``I don't know any good
reason why we shouldn't be doing that.''
   Wright was asked if he believed the Nicaraguan government should
be allowed to receive ``whatever foreign assistance ... it deems
fit in its own interest'' in light of the regional peace accord
that bars funds from foreign sources seeking to overthrow a
government.
   ``I don't see anything wrong with their getting humanitarian
assistance or economic assistance. God knows they need all the help
they can get from every source with the state their economy is
in,'' the speaker said.
   ``But I think it has to come to a point where there is a
cessation of military weapons. ... And now that's up to the Reagan
administration to sit down and negotiate that.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face
the Nation,'' repeated his call for direct negotiations with the
United States.
   ``We're ready to talk with the United States,'' Ortega said.
   But Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, appearing on
the same program, rejected the idea of direct talks with Nicaragua.
   ``We don't need bilateral talks with the Sandinistas,'' Abrams
said.
   He expressed skepticism that the Nicaraguan government will hold
to the agreement signed with the Contras, saying, ``We've heard
those promises before.''
   Abrams said Congress had forced the agreement on the rebels,
saying ``Congress had just smashed them into a corner'' with the
cutoff of military aid.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero, also appearing on the NBC program,
said he believed he should be included in the Wright-Michel
discussions.
   ``I feel that we should be invited by Speaker Wright to go to
Washington and participate,'' he said.

   Filing for personal bankruptcy was
``embarrassing,'' says famed heart surgeon Dr. Denton Cooley, but
it was the only solution for his financial troubles.
   The 67-year-old pioneer heart surgeon's career has been a
success story. He was the first to implant an artificial heart and
the first American to perform a heart transplant operation, among
his 70,000 open-heart surgeries.
   But defeat entered Cooley's life on Jan. 4 when he filed under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law, his many real estate
investments in Houston victimized by a depressed oil economy.
   ``I think this is the first (professional) defeat that has come
to me,'' he told the Houston Post in Sunday's editions. ``It was
embarrassing. ... There's sort of an indignity that goes with it.''
   ``But I've always felt like I was a real competitor. I have
participated in all sorts of sports and athletics in the past, and
one of the things you learn on the playing field is how to take
defeat as well as victory.''
   Cooley, founder of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, said
he's one of the few people to file a reorganization plan at the
same time as a request for bankruptcy protection. That move will
allow him to emerge from bankruptcy as early as April, he says.
   ``I want to carry on with my life,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jackson's Michigan Win Over Dukakis: On The Last Day, The Signs
Were There</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was late for the final rally of
his Michigan caucus campaign, but his staff was still scrambling to
fill a half-empty hall in the Polish enclave of Hamtramck.
   At the same time, miles away in Flint, 40 people were turned
away from the overflowing church where Jesse Jackson was speaking.
So they gathered around a television station's truck to watch
Jackson on the monitors.
   Campaign events are an uncertain barometer of election success,
but in Michigan, the developments on Friday were an excellent
forecaster of the results on Saturday.
   Dukakis had a difficult day _ a schedule snarled by logistical
problems and a sometimes testy response from some spectators.
   In contrast, Jackson was drawing substantial, enthusiastic
crowds as he motored across the state.
   And on Saturday, that enthusiasm turned into votes that gave
Jackson an overwhelming victory, crushing Dukakis by nearly 2-1 in
the big industrial state.
   ``I think the major factor was the level of intensity of Jackson
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters,''
Michigan House Speaker Gary Owen said.
   Owen said he found ``an overwhelming lack of enthusiasm'' for
everybody but Jackson. Owen supports Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   As expected, Jackson swept the black vote by margins of up to
15-1. But he did well in others parts of the state with small
minority populations, winning 10 of the state's 18 congressional
districts.
   Jackson knows well the dubious reliability of rallies and town
meetings as indicators of political success. He drew big crowds in
1984 and still finished third in the Democratic presidential race
that year.
   But in Michigan this time, the indicators were right on the
money.
   ``In some sense, it's a lot of poetry,'' Jackson said in
Milwaukee late Saturday. ``It's a lot of history. We also have the
numbers, and it's a lot of reality.''
   At the Hamtramck event, the audience was no longer so small as
to be embarrassing when Dukakis arrived with Detroit Mayor Coleman
Young, Sen. Don Riegle and others. But at least a quarter of the
crowd was made up of reporters and plainclothes policemen.
   Earlier that day in Detroit, two plainclothes policemen stopped
a reporter and asked why a crowd had gathered down the street. Told
that Jesse Jackson was speaking, the two parked _ and went inside
the union hall to listen.
   Crowds generally waited patiently for Jackson to appear. But in
Comstock Park, the grumbling was evident when Dukakis arrived about
half an hour late due to logistical problems that wiped out many of
his planned events.
   ``Make them wait _ we did,'' yelled one older man as Dukakis cut
short his town meeting in the Grand Rapids suburb to hold a news
conference and rush to a fund-raiser.
   ``Speak English _ this is America,'' said another as Dukakis
spoke in Greek and Spanish with those in the UAW hall who addressed
him in those languages.
   Jackson worked this state hard, even delaying his departure from
the state on Saturday to motorcade and walk through mostly black
neighborhoods, encouraging his supporters to turn out.
   Dukakis spent less time in the state. He flew in Monday night
for a quick visit, held a pair of news conferences Wednesday night
and then muddled through the day Friday.
   Part of the difference in schedules came from Dukakis'
commitment to return to Boston to work as governor, part from
Dukakis' greater attention to fund-raising and part from campaign
judgments about allocating candidate's time among the various
states.
   And when Dukakis was in the state, he found himself explaining
over and over again that he had not flip-flopped on the trade
issue, that his backing for a trade bill by Sen. Don Riegle of
Michigan was not just a political ploy. Rep. Richard Gephardt
grabbed the front pages by pounding away at Dukakis on trade.
   It didn't help Gephardt _ he finished a dismal third _ but the
blows kept Dukakis on the defensive.
   The messages from the two candidates were also substantively
different. Dukakis talked of competence and compassion, as his
televisions ads emphasized balancing budgets and creating jobs.
   Jackson hit over and over again at his theme of hope for those
who are down, who are jobless, who are out of luck.
   In a state where the auto industry has put thousands out of
work, Jackson's more optimistic message was the stronger one _ as
Dukakis came close to admitting Saturday night in defeat.
   ``The people of Michigan have been through a very difficult
time. There is great unhappiness, great concern, great uncertainty.
There are laid-off workers. Workers today who have jobs are worried
they are going to be next,'' Dukakis said. ``Jesse has strong
feelings about that _ as I do.''
   Dukakis relied on an impressive organization in Michigan, as he
has in other states, plus endorsements from Young and Riegle.
   Jackson had a good organization himself in Michigan and spent
about $90,000 on paid media. But he couldn't resist a swipe at
Dukakis.
   ``It was the message of the soul and authenticity of Jesse
Jackson versus money and technology _ and the people prevailed,''
Jackson told supporters Sunday at Westchester County Airport in New
York.
   ``Everybody won something in Detroit,'' Jackson said when the
votes were counted. ``Dukakis won Mayor Young's endorsement. I won
the people's votes.''

   Michael Dukakis gained and Jesse Jackson
received a smaller boost as Iowa Democrats went through the latest
step in their lengthy process of choosing Democratic National
Convention delegates.
   Richard Gephardt, whose hopes had surged with a victory in last
month's Iowa precinct caucuses, faltered in the latest test
following poor showings in other states.
   ``It confirms what's going on nationally,'' said Bonnie
Campbell, Iowa Democratic chairwoman.
   Party activists over the weekend held county caucuses where they
elected delegates to congressional district conventions in May and
the state convention next summer. At those meetings they will elect
52 of the state's 58 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. The state has six ``super delegates,'' party
leaders who automatically are delegates.
   With 97 of the state's 99 counties reporting results of their
conventions, Dukakis had 28.7 percent of the delegates to
Gephardt's 27.9 percent. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon was third with
26.4 percent, based on a strong showing in counties along the
border of his home state.
   Jackson pulled in 13.1 percent of the delegates, improving on
his performance in last month's precinct caucuses, while 3.9
percent remained uncommitted.
   In last month's precinct caucuses, Gephardt got 31 percent,
Simon 27 percent, Dukakis 22 percent and Jackson 9 percent.
   Dukakis backers had been quietly lobbying supporters of other
candidates to switch and unite behind a front-runner.
   ``I'm telling our people to treat everyone like you would your
next date,'' said Jerry Crawford, a Dukakis organizer. ``But for
some people it isn't time to get engaged yet.''
   The Dukakis forces targeted backers of former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt, who has dropped from the race, and succeeded in picking up
support.
   ``It looks like those people who defected, Dukakis picked up the
lion's share,'' said Ms. Campbell. ``Jackson picked up a few.''
   Party activists said Gephardt was damaged by his poor
performance in Saturday's Michigan caucuses.
   As word filtered out of Gephardt's third-place Michigan showing,
some of his backers apparently decided not to make the effort to
attend county conventions, many of which ran until the wee hours
Sunday morning.

<HEAD>Intense Effort Factor In Jackson Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF HOLYFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said he was looking at the votes,
not the color of the voters, in his landslide victory over Michael
Dukakis in the state's presidential caucuses.
   Jackson's commanding 55 percent of the vote far outstripped the
state's black population, which according to the 1980 census is 13
percent.
   As usual, Jackson galvanized the black community, which
responded with a highly organized get-out-the-vote effort for
Saturday's caucuses.
   That provided him with a solid core of support _ but he didn't
stop there. Campaigning in Connecticut on Sunday, Jackson said his
first concern is to ``count the votes, not the color.''
   ``It's a campaign of growth, a campaign of hope,'' he said.
   Mary Holmes, deputy state coordinator for the Jackson campaign,
said, ``What feels so good is that it's a clear-cut victory. It's
all ours. You want to talk about the popular vote? We won that. You
want to talk about the majority of delegates? We won that too.''
   Holmes said the keys to the Jackson victory were the campaign's
plan to turn out the vote for the caucuses, and Jackson himself.
``It's the effect he has on people who hear him,'' she said.
   Her comments were echoed by Michigan House Speaker Gary Owen,
who said ``the major factor was the level of intensity of Jackson
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters.''
   Owen, who supports Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., said Sunday
that he had campaigned several days and found ``an overwhelming
lack of enthusiasm'' for any of the candidates except Jackson.
   ``I know there was excitement in seeing a presidential candidate
and hearing a presidential candidate, but I never felt that degree
of intensity among the crowds for those other candidates,'' he said.
   That intensity was reflected in the vote totals, where Jackson
buried Dukakis with 107,689 votes or 55 percent to Dukakis' 55,337
or 28 percent. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt came in third with
24,995 or 13 percent. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 4,069 or 2
percent; and Gore had 3,818 or 2 percent.
   Those totals represented 94 percent of the vote counted. The
state Democratic Party said it would release final figures sometime
today.
   The delegate projections from those results showed Jackson with
74 of the state's 138 committed delegates, Dukakis with 50,
Gephardt 11, and uncommitted 3.
   Michigan also will send 12 uncommitted ``super delegates'' to
the July convention in Atlanta. They are Gov. James Blanchard and
the 11 members of the Democratic National Committee.
   Jackson particularly swamped Dukakis in the predominantly black
1st and 13th congressional districts, which cover Detroit. In the
1st, Jackson had 25,416 compared with 1,809 for Dukakis, while in
the 13th he had 17,725 to Dukakis's 1,539.
   However, if those figures are subtracted from the two
candidates' totals, Jackson still comes out ahead, 64,548 to 51,989.
   State Rep. Alma Stallworth, a Democrat from Detroit, said she
thinks those figures represent ``a lot of young people and new
voters who got involved for the first time.''
   Stallworth said the highly organized Jackson campaign also got a
boost from black churches, which urged people to vote.
   But she pointed out that Jackson also did well in mostly white
districts covering the western, southern and eastern Lower
Peninsula.
   State Rep. Ilona Varga, who supports Jackson, said he carried
her district, which is only 26 percent black, by attracting white
voters.
   ``I think it says something about our people. I think it says
something about our country,'' she said.
   ``He was saying what people wanted to hear,'' said state Sen.
David Holmes, D-Detroit. ``It all boils down to bread-and-butter
issues regardless of race, color or creed. He outworked, outtalked
and outcampaigned the other candidates in all 18 congressional
districts.''
   Zolton Ferency, a former state Democratic Party chairman, said
organized labor leaders liked Gephardt's tough trade stand, but
``his campaign was dying. They didn't want to back a loser.''
   Dukakis, on the other hand, wasn't well-known in Michigan and
had to introduce himself to the state's Democrats and then try to
get them to vote for him, Ferency said.
   Dukakis, he added, wasn't ``the kind of candidate that can
generate instant enthusiasm.''

   Maneka Gandhi's goals include saving the

the country.
   The 31-year-old writer, former model and once and probably
future candidate for Parliament is the estranged sister-in-law of

late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the widow of Sanjay Gandhi,
who was groomed to become prime minister but died in a crash while
stunt-flying a small plane.

permanent resident, Maneka's pedigreed bull mastiff Sabra.
   In mid-March, Maneka disbanded her own small political party and
joined forces with the Janata Party, one of the largest of India's
many opposition groups. She declared anew her determination to see
Rajiv ousted, calling him an ineffective leader and his Congress
Party corrupt.
   Within a week, newspapers were speculating Maneka would run
against her brother-in-law in the next parliamentary elections,
scheduled to take place by early 1990.
   ``Whether I stand for office is something that will be decided
in a year or two,'' Maneka says.
   ``I really think quite frankly that the time for little parties
is past. We have a huge upsurge of opinion against the government,
but because we are all separate, none of it has come into the
mainstream opposition. It's gone to the lunatic fringe,'' she said
during an interview in the one-story house where she lives with her
7-year-old son Feroze.
   In the meantime, she is continuing her animal protection
campaigns and describes her political outlook as similar to that of
the environment-oriented ``Greens'' parties of Western Europe.
   ``Every time I do animal work, I lose votes. I'm in politics _
that's my main philosophy. I just don't believe you can isolate one
form of service from the other,'' she said.
   Speaking with the intensity and speed of a machine gun burst, in
British-accented English that is the hallmark of economically
comfortable, well-educated Indians, Maneka launched into precise
examples:
   ``We are killing 21 million frogs a year in India for standard
experiments in our school laboratories. If I run a save-the-frogs
campaign, it's not because one of them is going to turn into a
prince in my hand. It's because the small farmer needs them.
Without frogs to eat the insects in his fields, he has to buy
pesticides, which will probably give him cancer. So it's really a
political decision, not an animal decision, the campaign for the
saving of the frogs.''
   As a young bride, Maneka filled the role of adoring wife and
daughter-in-law. But after Sanjay was killed in 1980, Maneka grew
apart _ outspokenly apart _ from his iron-willed mother, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Indira, in the meantime, had plucked Sanjay's older brother
Rajiv out of his pilot's job with Indian Airlines and put him in
the cockpit to succeed her in what is sometimes wryly referred to
as ``the world's only democratically elected dynasty.''
   In 1982, Maneka was pitched out of Indira's house with her son,
two dogs and a heap of suitcases.
   She started her own party, the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, dedicated
to perpetuating what it called the populist ideas of her dead
husband.
   When Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, Rajiv became prime
minister. Two months later, he successfully defended his Parliament
seat in new elections, swamping a field of challengers.
   One of them was Maneka.
   Her party faded into the shadows, but her energetic espousal of
causes didn't. Much of it was channeled to the Sanjay Gandhi Animal
Care Center on the outskirts of the capital.
   The red sandstone clinic, staffed by two veterinarians and 11
helpers, is refuge for sick and injured animals brought by their
owners or found in the streets.
   Or dumped at Maneka's house. In this way she has acquired, at
least temporarily, hundreds of dogs, the occasional bullock, a
peacock with a tumor and a white donkey with one eye sightlessly
opaque and an oozing hole where the other had been.
   ``I went out to dinner and came back about 11:30 and found it
tied to the gate, blinded, bloody,'' Maneka said.
   The donkey went to the animal center. It will probably stay
there indefinitely, like Lakshmi, a one-eyed chestnut mare who
arrived nearly seven years ago. The horse's right hind leg extends
foward at an improbable but permanent angle, the result of violent
dislocation.
   Lakshmi, named for a Hindu goddess, is one of Maneka's
favorites. ``She's my first. That's why we call her Lakshmi. It
means luck,'' Maneka said as she led a tour of the clinic and
grounds where 41 dogs were ensconced.
   She also serves as a free-lance consultant for wildlife
sanctuaries throughout India, counseling warmer water for
crocodiles penned in icy Himalayan waters, trying to figure out why
some monkeys at Bangalore aren't breeding, and how to end the
plight of the dancing bears.
   ``There are 10,000 bears in India who have been kidnapped from
the Himalayas,'' she said. ``They have their teeth pulled out,
their nails pulled out. They're made to dance. Their average
lifespan is 42 years, but they die at 3.''
   She has heard about a man who wants to donate land for an animal
sanctuary, ``so maybe it's going to fit in with my bears. Maybe we
can use zoos as halfway houses, get the railroads to transport
them, rehabilitate the bear handlers _ some can work in the
sanctuary, line up businessmen to give the others jobs.''
   In between politics and animal care, she writes a biweekly pet
column for newspapers, has just completed a book on the origins of
Indian names and has promised two more, one of fairy tales, the
other on the plants of India.
   The book of names, she said, was ``the kind of job I don't have
any business undertaking, like most of the things I do. But if you
wait for people? So I just sort of begin. Every time I start
something, it's always sort of off the beaten track.''

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Sings For Gridiron</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A first lady once criticized for extravagance
got in a good-natured jab at her Soviet counterpart's own
fashionable ways when Nancy Reagan put on a surprise singing
performance at the Washington media's annual Gridiron Club dinner.
   Mrs. Reagan, dressed in a red formal gown, unexpectedly appeared
on stage Saturday night as a chorus of journalists was wrapping up
its ribbing of key figures in the news, including the first family,
the presidential candidates and Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   The first lady received two standing ovations for her song,
which included a verse about her meetings with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, during the Washington summit
last December.
   To the tune of ``Thanks for the Memories,'' Mrs. Reagan sang,
``Thanks for the memory, the Soviet Mona Lisa, sometimes known as
Raisa, she said to me, `Would you like to see my MasterCard and
Visa?'''
   President Reagan, beaming at his wife's show-stopper, issued the
challenge ``Raisa, top that'' after Mrs. Reagan's song.
   ``It was all in good humor,'' Mrs. Reagan's press secretary
Elaine Crispin said Sunday. ``The whole Gridiron is done in that
spirit, and that's all that's intended.'' She said the words to
Mrs. Reagan's song were written by former White House speech-writer
Landon Parvin.
   Although both Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev maintained that
their relations during the December summit were warm, observers
noticed a coolness between the two women.
   It was Mrs. Reagan's second appearance as a solo singer on the
Gridiron stage. In 1982, amidst criticism of her expensive tastes,
she stepped out in an outlandish Hawaiian print dress with polka
dot sleeves and yellow galoshes and sang a self-effacing ``Second
Hand Clothes'' to the tune of ``Second Hand Rose.''
   Mrs. Reagan was an actress but has sung only occasionally.
   Reagan, in his traditional Gridiron response, poked fun at Vice
President George Bush and Bush's fellow Republican presidential
candidate Pat Robertson as well as rich Republicans.
   ``Before I refuse to take questions,'' Reagan said, ``I have an
opening statement. I thought Nancy's performance was absolutely
wonderful. Raisa, top that.''
   Reagan later said if Robertson becomes president, ``there'd be
no more `Hail to the Chief.' It would be `When the Saints Go
Marching In.''
   Referring to the fact that Bush was born in Massachusetts, has
family connections in Connecticut, has been active in politics in
Texas, and spends time in Maine, Reagan said Bush could win ``if he
carries his own states.''
   During the show, a chorus of Washington journalists thanked
Reagan ``for the memories'' _ the memories ``of David Stockman and
Jim Watt, the Iran-Contra plot, of Ollie and Bill Casey, the
diversions you forgot.''
   The tune lampooned former Budget Director David Stockman, the
late CIA director Casey, ex-Interior Secretary James Watt and
former White House aide Oliver North.
   The 103-year-old club also presented a spoof to the tune of ``To
All the Girls I've Loved Before'' by show members playing former
Sen. Gary Hart and television evangelist Jim Bakker.

   Here are the words Mrs. Reagan sang:
   ``Thanks for the memory, of all the times we had, the happy and
the sad.
   ``Looking back, Don Regan doesn't seem so bad.
   ``Oh, it's been so swell.
   ``Thanks for the memory, the Soviet Mona Lisa, sometimes known
as Raisa, she said to me, `Would you like to see my MasterCard and
Visa?'
   ``Oh, it's been so swell.
   ``Not all was happy, that's granted.
   ``The Congress, it raved and ranted.
   ``The right wing became disenchanted.
   ``In spite of it all, we had a ball.
   ``Thanks for the memory, of the whole press corps, at times I
cursed and swore.
   ``You sometimes were a headache, but you never were a bore.
   ``So, thanks for the memory, it's time to say goodbye.
   ``Oh, how the time does fly.
   ``Ronny's loved these past eight years, and so I confess have I.
   ``Thank you, bye bye.''

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Monday while stock prices rose.
   The dollar closed at 124.43 yen, down 1.31 yen from Friday's
close of 125.74 yen, after opening the day's session at 124.60.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 305.99 points in Saturday's half day of
trading, rose 301.99 points, or 1.19 percent, and closed at
25,622.71.
   Traders said the dollar continued to decline even after the Bank
of Japan intervened in early trading by buying dollars to support
the U.S. currency, said Ken Iio, a currency dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo.
   The dollar's opening level was its lowest since Jan. 5, when it
began trading at 123.00 yen.
   On the stock market, dealers said the lower dollar did not
affect prices because market participants were expecting the
central bank to continue to prop up the U.S. currency.

<HEAD>Protesters Angered by Chemical Attacks on Kurds Stage Violent
Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 people threw stones and bottles that
broke windows and smashed the front door of the Iraqi embassy in an
angry demonstration against chemical weapons attacks that killed
more than 5,000 Kurds last week.
   But local police said no one was arrested in Sunday's incident.
   A Supreme Court ruling last week knocked down a rule that had
kept all demonstrations, including peaceful ones, at least 500 feet
away from foreign embassies. However, the court still allowed
police to disperse groups congregating near embassies when they
``reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the
embassy is present.''
   Iran has said Iraq used internationally banned poison gas bombs
in a March 20 air raid that killed 5,000 Kurdish villagers. A
leader of Kurdish rebels in the area of northeastern Iraq occupied
by Iran said at least 50 other Kurds were killed and scores wounded
Thursday when Iraqi planes bombed Seyo and Senan villages nearby.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said the Iraqis used cyanide, mustard and other
unidentified nerve gases in the attacks ``to prevent the people
from joining Iranian combatants.''
   The attacks came in the latest confrontations of the 7{-year war
between Iran and Iraq which began in September 1980. Fighting has
recently intensified in the Kurdistan mountains for control of a
strategic area east of the Kirkuk oil fields, which produces more
than half the oil that finances Iraq's war effort.
   Many Kurds, a semi-nomadic Sunni Moslem people, have been
fighting the Baghdad government for years.

<TEXT>
   A judge's decision to reunite two
girls with their father three years after they watched him strangle
their mother has touched off a new custody fight and public outrage
against the judge.
   ``I guess the bottom line is whether or not it's OK to kill your
wife in front of your children,'' says Gene Tranel of Eldridge,
Iowa, brother of the 26-year-old victim, Carol Lutgen.
   Tranel, who took in his nieces, Tracy, 11, and Dana, 10, while
James Lutgen served a 20-month prison term, is fighting to get them
back.
   But Lutgen's lawyer, William Schirger, says the case has been
blown out of proportion in this small Mississippi River town.
   ``The kids are not in any danger. Jim loves the girls and they
love him. They asked the judge to let them live with him,''
Schirger said.
   Lutgen, 33, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the
Dec. 21, 1984, death of his wife at the family home in tiny
Menominee, in the northwest corner of Illinois.
   Two original murder counts against Lutgen were reduced after the
court ruled his daughters were too young to testify as witnesses to
their mother's death.
   The Lutgens were on the verge of a breakup as the 1984 holiday
season approached. ``She didn't love Jim no more,'' recalled
Lutgen's mother, Grace. ``They were separating the day after
Christmas. He was broken up about it.''
   The couple's fatal battle was fueled by Lutgen's belief that his
wife was seeing another man, his mother said, although the fight
was sparked by a disagreement over whether to take the girls
shopping and skating.
   As the girls looked on, verbal attack became physical
confrontation.
   ``I picked the girls up afterward and they told me ... they had
seen part of the fight,'' Mrs. Lutgen said. ``They said they were
pushing and grabbing each other around the neck.''
   Lutgen was released from prison in October 1986 and regained
custody of his daughters last Dec. 29.
   The Jo Daviess County judge who made the custody decision, Eric
DeMar of Galena, has borne the brunt of the public outcry since
Lutgen regained his daughters.
   DeMar has been attacked by mail, over the telephone and in
newspaper articles and editorials.
   ``A judge can't always make a popular decision and that
certainly is the truth in this case,'' he said.
   ``The law and the facts in the case left me no choice,'' he
added, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has placed a high
priority on parental rights in custody cases.
   Lutgen, a cement finisher in the construction business, has not
responded to requests for comment. But his mother says she believes
there is no risk to the girls.
   ``I check on them several times a week. I'd never let anything
happen to them. They love their Dad,'' she said.
   Lutgen has continued to have family troubles. His mother said he
and the girls moved out of her house to one of his two brothers'
homes after an argument with her last month.
   Meanwhile, Tranel has fought Lutgen's request for custody of the
girls. He filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his former
brother-in-law and is appealing DeMar's custody decision.
   ``It seems to me to be so basically, morally wrong for the
children to go back to their parent in a case like this,'' said
Tranel, who has visitation rights.
   ``Is that person a fit and proper parent?'' Tranel asked. ``How
can you get your children back and go on like nothing happened?''
   Schirger countered that Lutgen's criminal conviction did not
strip him of his parental rights, and he has not been proved an
unfit parent.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, who
continues to disavow interest in the Democratic Party's
presidential nomination, won the plurality of write-in votes cast
in the Michigan presidential primary.
   Second place went to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who also says he
won't seek the party's nomination.
   Other non-candidates and notables also got backing from
write-ins.
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who last week endorsed
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, picked up at least seven votes.
   Candidates who left the race early, Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt
and Deleware Sen. Joe Biden, each pulled minor support from
write-ins.
   So did candidates who battled for the nomination 16 years ago _
Edmund Muskie and George McGovern.
   Even Republican Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, whose bid for the
GOP nomination is hanging by a frayed thread, received one vote in
the Democratic caucuses.
   And, how about rock star Ozzie Osbourne? Or maybe the Road
Runner's arch enemy Wile E. Coyote?
   They each got one vote. The Road Runner got no votes.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds a slim
lead over Jesse Jackson but many likely Democratic voters are
undecided on a candidate going into Wisconsin's April 5
presidential preference primary, a new poll indicates.
   The Milwaukee Sentinel, in results being released in today's
editions, said the statewide public opinion poll conducted last
week showed Dukakis to be the choice of 28 percent of the likely
Democratic voters.
   Jackson, winner of the Michigan caucus vote Saturday, was the
choice of 25 percent, but another 25 percent of those likely to
vote for a Democrat in the primary were undecided.
   Among other Democratic candidates, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had
9 percent, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt 7 percent and Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 4 percent.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush was the
choice of 62 percent of those likely to vote for a Republican,
while Kansas Sen. Robert Dole was the choice of 27 percent. The
Rev. Pat Robertson received 3 percent, and 7 percent were undecided.
   The Sentinel said its telephone survey of 798 randomly-selected
Wisconsin adults was conducted March 17-22.
   Among the sample of 158 people identified as likely to vote in
the Democratic primary, the margin of sampling error was plus or
minus 7.9 percent.

   With the New York primary less than a month
away, a recent poll shows Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Vice President George Bush to be the clear favorites among
Democratic and Republican voters across the state. The Daily News
poll, published Sunday, had Dukakis favored by 45 percent of the
Democrats surveyed. His closest rival was Jesse Jackson, preferred
by 29 percent of the Democrats.
   None of the three other active Democratic candidates were
favored by more than 6 percent of the voters who participated in
the survey. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was favored by 6
percent, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon by 5 percent and Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore by 5 percent.
   On the Republican side, voters surveyed favored Bush by 68
percent, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole by 23 percent and former television
evangelist Pat Roberson by 4 percent.
   The poll, conducted for the Daily News by Chilton Research
Services of Radnor, Pa., surveyed 528 Democrats and 496 Republicans
who said they intended to vote in the primary. The poll was
conducted between Monday, March 21 and Thursday, March 24 and has a
margin for error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
   Two hundred twenty-five Democratic delegates and 136 GOP
delegates are at stake in the April 19 primary.

   If Vice President George Bush becomes
the Republican Party's candidate for the presidency, he will have
the support of Pat Robertson.
   Robertson, a former television evangelist and current GOP
hopeful, also said over the weekend that if Bush is elected, he
most likely would not challenge him in 1992 if Bush opted for a
second term.
   ``It will all depend on what George Bush does as president,''
Robertson said in a news conference following a rally of his
supporters. ``Basically I would support the Republican president.
That would not be a wise thing _ to go against the president of
your own party.''
   But until the national convention, Robertson said he is
concentrating on his own campaign, a campaign he admits no longer
is aimed at the White House but at the future.
   And if he is to survive, Robertson told his supporters he must
win his home state's upcoming caucuses.
   Robertson placed third earlier this month behind Bush and Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole in Virginia's non-binding primary. He also was third
in his hometown of Virginia Beach.

   The punishment of fallen TV evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart was left to his church's key governing body today,
in an effort to settle a dispute between state and national leaders
of the Assemblies of God.
   The Pentecostal denomination's 250-member General Presbytery
opens a two-day meeting, with a decision on Swaggart's punishment
expected Tuesday afternoon, church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said.
   The General Presbytery will have the final say on Swaggart's
rehabilitation. Swaggart has been linked to a prostitute, but the
exact nature of his transgression has not been disclosed since he
tearfully stepped down from his pulpit Feb. 21.
   The Louisiana Presbytery of the Assemblies of God had
recommended that Swaggart undergo two years of rehabilitation and
be suspended from his Baton Rouge, La., pulpit for three months.
   But the Executive Presbytery, 13 men who serve as a national
board of directors for the church, asked the state district to
reconsider what some called an unprecedentedly lenient response to
a minister's moral lapse.
   After gathering again on Feb. 29 in a nine-hour session, the
Louisiana Presbytery stood by its original decision. The General
Presbytery, whose members include representatives from each of the
church's state districts, has been charged with resolving the
conflict.
   Reports circulated that Swaggart would leave the Assemblies of
God if church officials suspended him from his pulpit for longer
than three months. But a spokesman for Swaggart's ministry said he
has made no decision on how he might react to the national
council's decision.
   Mrs. Turnage said she did not believe the General Presbytery
would be swayed by ``rumors heard through the media.''
   Church officials refused to comment on a newspaper report that a
compromise proposal has been offered that would bar Swaggart from
preaching for one year, but would order him to give public
testimony about his sin.
   The 10-page proposal, obtained Sunday night by The Springfield
News-Leader, was worked out by Cliff Jackson, a Little Rock, Ark.,
lawyer and church member who said the plan has been endorsed by
both Swaggart and Louisiana church leaders.
   Swaggart, who addressed his congregation briefly in Baton Rouge
on Sunday as he has done several times since formally relinquishing
the pulpit, is not expected to appear at today's meeting, Mrs.
Turnage said.
   In response to reporters' shouted questions as he drove from the
service, Swaggart said he wasn't planning to leave the ministry,
adding, ``Why should I?''
   The General Presbytery is a court of last resort on ministerial
credentials. A minister usually appeals to it after his course of
rehabilitation has been set by the Executive Presbytery and a state
council. The Executive Presbytery short-circuited that process when
it decided March 3 to turn the Swaggart case over to the larger
body.
   The Louisiana Presbytery has close ties to Swaggart's Jimmy
Swaggart World Ministries, a television-church-school complex based
in Baton Rouge that broadcasts Swaggart's fiery sermons to several
countries. Louisiana Superintendent Cecil Janway, for example, sits
on Swaggart's board.
   Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries took in an estimated $150
million in 1986. Donations have fallen off since Swaggart's
confession, forcing the ministry to lay off about 100 people and
suspend construction at the Jimmy Swaggart Bible School.
   But Swaggart seems undaunted and apparently is counting on the
General Presbytery to follow the Louisiana district's
recommendation that he be barred from the pulpit for only three
months.
   Swaggart told the congregation Wednesday that he was going out
of his mind but ``when I'm back in the pulpit on May 22, I'll be
back in my mind.''
   May 22 would be three months from the day Swaggart confessed and
voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit.

<HEAD>Thieves Get 12.3 Million Vehicles Worth $52 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government estimates that between
1973 and 1985 more than 12.3 million cars, trucks, vans and
motorcycles valued at $52 billion were stolen from Americans.
   After recovery of about 65 percent of them, losses were
estimated at $29 billion in 1985 dollars, the government said
Sunday.
   Insurance payments reduced actual losses to vehicle owners to an
estimated $16.1 billion, according to an analysis of the Bureau of
Justice Statistics National Crime Surveys for the the 13-year
period.
   The number of thefts per 1,000 registered vehicles fell 33
percent over the surveyed period, from nine to just six, the bureau
concluded in an analysis of its semiannual surveys of more than
40,000 households nationwide.
   In addition to the vehicle thefts during the period, there were
an estimated 7 million attempted thefts, said BJS director Steven
Schlesinger. About 64 percent of those were not reported to police,
he said, and 13 percent of the actual vehicle thefts also went

   A survey of college presidents indicates women
may have trouble combining marriage with a climb to the top of the
academic ladder.
   In a survey released Sunday by the American Council on
Education, 90 percent of male college presidents but only 35
percent of the female presidents said they were married.
   Excluding nuns, priests and other members of religious orders,
it said, ``the difference ... narrows somewhat. Among the lay
presidents, 93 percent of men but 49 percent of women were
married.''
   The women presidents were more likely to be divorced _ 11
percent compared with 3 percent of the men.
   The council's report on its survey, called ``The American
College President: A Contemporary Profile,'' concluded, ``The image
of who shall occupy the chief executive office is clearly still a
traditional one.''
   The survey indicated the typical college president is white,
male, married and 53 years old.

<HEAD>European Official See Flaws in US Deregulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Western Europe's top airline regulator is
warning U.S. officials that there may be a sudden rise in fares in
this country as a result of deregulation.
   Frederick Soerensen, head of the air transport division at the
European Commission, says U.S. deregulation has been in the main
successful. But then he adds: ``When we see how, after the first
few months of enthusiastic expansionism, the number of operational
airlines is tending to shrink further and further, we may well
wonder whether deregulation does not lead, in the end, to
cartelization, and whether the tendency for fares to fall in the
first few years may not suddenly go in reverse.
   ``What is more the United States has run into unexpected
infrastructure problems and operating conditions are becoming
difficult. I am thinking in particular of airport congestion at
peak operating times.''
   Soerensen's criticism was in a paper he distributed during a
visit to the United States last week.

   Paul Ridgeway's magic trick was a hit with
his audience, but it was a bomb as far as police were concerned.
   Ridgeway used the trick during his address on ``The Impact of
Special Events'' before public relations people at a downtown
hotel. He had been invited by Tom Jardine, vice president of public
relations for the Carlson Companies.
   ``The reason why Tom gives me a nice introduction is that I have
this dating book and it's really hot,'' Ridgeway told the group as
he opened a book and a flame magically shot out.
   The group laughed and Ridgeway, a public relations consultant,
finished his talk. But he left the book behind when he left the
hotel Thursday.
   A hotel employee called security guards when he opened the prop
and saw wires and batteries. A guard took it to a basement office,
checked it over and decided it was harmless.
   But hotel officials had second thoughts on Friday and called
police.
   ``There was a strange odor coming from it,'' said Sgt. Rick
Nelson of the bomb squad.
   Nelson wrapped the book in a lead-lined blanket, drove it to the
bomb squad's disposal range and blew it apart with a high-pressure
water cannon.

   An Irish firefighter says that after
traveling to eight American cities named Dublin on a three-week
visit to the United States, he is ready to return to the Dublin he
knows best.
   Seamus O'Connor, station officer of the Dublin, Ireland, Fire
Department and coordinator of the visit, wrapped up his tour with
five other Irish firefighters by shopping Sunday afternoon in this
Columbus suburb.
   Dublin, Ohio, with a population of 14,000, has been a city since
September and has planned a yearlong celebration. Dublin, Ireland,
is marking its 1,000th birthday this year.
   O'Connor, 44, said there are 16 cities named Dublin in the
United States, but ``four thousand miles is enough in one trip.''
   ``Maybe we'll visit the other Dublins during our 2000th
anniversary,'' he said.
   The firefighters have been to Dublins in Indiana, North
Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, Kentucky and
Ohio in an attempt to ``to share greetings of native Irish with the
offspring Dublins,'' O'Conner said.
   ``This is the biggest Dublin we've been to in the United States
and the most modern,'' O'Connor said of the Ohio city. ``But it's
very Irish-connected. They have many things planned around the
Irish, but I say `Never enough.'''

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's weekend victory in the Michigan
Democratic presidential caucuses raised the stakes in Wisconsin's
April 5 primary.
   Massachussets Gov. Michael S. Dukakis will begin an ``aggressive
campaign'' of television advertising in Wisconsin Tuesday and will
be in the state Thursday through April 5, said Dukakis' Wisconsin
campaign manager, Pat Forciea.
   ``We feel this is a two-person race,'' Forciea said.
   Some of the Dukakis advertising will be new, but he will not
take on Jackson in the commercials, Forciea said.
   ``None of the ads are zapping anybody,'' he said.
   Jackson edged Dukakis in Saturday's Michigan caucuses for his
first win in a major Northern industrial state.
   Jackson said he was confident he could follow Michigan with
another victory in Wisconsin ``because I've stood here with the
meat packers in Cudahy, the auto workers in Kenosha, and the paper
workers in De Pere.''
   Dukakis, who entered Saturday's caucuses as the front-runner and
ended in an almost 2-1 loss to Jackson, refused to categorize the
results as a significant setback.
   ``As I said in the beginning of this campaign, it's a
marathon,'' Dukakis said. ``You've asked me about inevitability. As
I have said on more than one occasion, nothing is inevitable about
anything in American politics.
   ``I hope when we finish up in California and New Jersey, I have
a lead I can take into the convention . . . and win the
nomination.''
   Dukakis and Jackson joined Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennesee,
Rep. Richard Gephardt, of Missouri, and Sen. Paul Simon, of
Illinois, at a Democratic Party fund-raising dinner in Milwaukee
Saturday night.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson left Sunday for Connecticut to lobby
for last-minute support before that state's primary Tuesday, while
Simon and Gore remained in Wisconsin.
   Wisconsin Democratic Chairwoman Suellen Albrecht predicted
nearly two-thirds of the Wisconsin voters who go to the polls April
5 will vote for a Democrat, giving the state its largest role in
selecting a presidential nominee in 12 years.
   Albrecht said Wisconsin residents could expect to see
``full-blown'' campaigning efforts from all the remaining
Democratic candidates over the next 10 days.
   Prior to the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Milwaukee, all the
candidates except Jackson joined about 1,500 people in an afternoon
labor rally and march to support nearly 600 Marathon Electric Corp.
shop workers represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local 1791 who have been involved in a
four-month fight over wage cuts in Wausau.
   Dukakis, Gephardt, and Simon walked behind a bright orange
solidarity banner with the workers and their supporters.
   Each candidate wore orange armbands saying ``Solidarity Local
1791'' as they sought the vote of laborers in Wisconsin.
   ``You've got a fight on your hands, and I want you to know
you've got friends across the state and across the nation and we're
here,'' Gore told a rally at a downtown parking lot before the
march.
   Jackson sent former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya to show his
support.
   While the front-runners began planning strategy to capture
delegates in the remaining states, Gephardt prepared to meet with
family and advisers to decide whether he would pull out of the race
and run for re-election to Congress.
   Gephardt has canceled his Wisconsin schedule and scheduled a
news conference today where it is expected he will annouce he will
file as a candidate for re-election by Tuesday's deadline.
   Gephardt had said he needed to do well in Michigan to sustain a
candidacy that took off in Iowa but stumbled in the South on Super
Tuesday. He finished a disappointing third.
   Dukakis said the field of candidates probably would be narrowed
again after Wisconsin's primary. Jackson declined to comment on
whether a Wisconsin victory would make him the front-runner. But
Jackson also said he had been the front-runner for a year.

   The average retail price of gasoline fell
again during the past two weeks, although prices were still higher
than a year ago, according to an industry survey.
   The price drop for all grades of gasoline was 0.78 cents a
gallon, bringing the average price to 94.96 cents a gallon as of
March 25, according to the Lundberg Survey of gasoline prices from
stations around the United States.
   The average price is just over 1{ cents a gallon more than that
of March 1987, and almost a nickel less than the March 1986 price
when crude oil prices were crashing, analyst Trilby Lundberg said
Sunday.
   The average prices for self-service pumps were: regular
unleaded, 85.55 cents a gallon; premium unleaded, $1.0083 cents a
gallon; and regular leaded, 82.13 cents a gallon.
   For full-service pumps, regular unleaded was $1.1625 cents a
gallon, premium unleaded $1.2653 cents a gallon and regular
unleaded was $1.1202 cents.

   A Contra rebel freed after more than
four years in prison said he will rejoin the Contras, who
negotiated his release under an amnesty agreement with the leftist
Sandinista government.
   Roberto Amador was among 100 people who walked out of the Zona
Franca jail on the outskirts of the capital Sunday as a result of
the agreement, part of a government-rebel cease-fire accord signed
last week in Sapoa.
   ``I will continue being a major in the FDN,'' Amador said,
referring to the Contra military arm, the National Democratic
Force, which will still be allowed to operate in designated
cease-fire zones. Sandinista and Contra leaders were to meet in
Sapoa again today to determine where those zones will be located.
   When he was freed, Amador received a hug from his wife, Melba,
who returned from Miami on Saturday with their two sons.
   ``It's a benediction from God that this happened,'' he said of
his release. Amador, 43, was captured on Oct. 3, 1983, when
Sandinista troops shot down the DC-3 supply plane he was piloting
for the Contra rebels.
   Two other captured crew members, Jaime Lau and Wilfredo
Gutierrez, also were released Sunday. But a fourth, Miguel Angel
Lopez, was not included on the list, said Amador, who also was a
major in the now-disbanded National Guard of President Anastasio
Somoza who was toppled in the 1979 Sandinista revolution.
   Gonzalo Ramirez, president of the Nicaraguan Red Cross, said on
Sunday that Contra negotiators had asked for Amador's freedom
during last week's talks.
   Isidora Zapata, a mother of two, also left the prison Sunday.
   ``I was condemned to 30 years in jail for counterrevolutionary
activities,'' said Mrs. Zapata, the only woman among those released.
   ``I was jailed since April 16, 1982, and since then have seen my
two children very little,'' she said. ``My husband died the same
year I went to jail. I don't know what he died of.''
   Also among those released were 12 members of the Independent
Liberal Party and 12 from the Social Christian Party.
   ``All were activists in our party and not Contras, which they
were accused of being,'' said Eduardo Coronado, an Independent
Liberal.
   Relatives embraced the prisoners as they left the jail, but
there was a tinge of anxiety.
   ``They say I don't have anything to fear,'' said Feliz Pedro
Chavaria Gomez, 32. ``I'm happy, but I hope it (the cease-fire)
doesn't fail.'' He said he was arrested in 1980 and charged with
being a counterrevolutionary.
   The prisoner release was the first step in an amnesty the
government agreed to last week when it signed an accord with the
U.S.-backed Contra leadership that calls for a formal 60-day
cease-fire to begin April 1.
   The amnesty law, passed Saturday by the National Assembly, could
affect the fate of an estimated 3,300 politial prisoners.

   Police riding herd on tens of
thousands of youths who jammed this desert resort for spring break
have made 140 arrests and issued 545 citations, but report the
students are behaving fairly well.
   Authorities say there have been no repeats of the rioting that
occurred in 1986, when youths went on a downtown rampage, throwing
beer bottles and tearing the clothes off young women.
   ``About 99 percent of those arrested were for public
drunkenness,'' said police Lt. Lee Weigel on Sunday. ``But all in
all, it appears as though the students are being pretty good.''
   Vacationing young people began invading this desert city 120
miles east of Los Angeles on Friday, clogging the streets as they
cruised and caroused. Traffic was backed up for several miles on
the roads entering Palm Springs on Sunday.
   Instead of rioting, huge crowds have flocked to ice cream and
yogurt parlors as temperatures soared to 100 degrees, said police
Officer Karen Holtz.
   From Friday through Sunday, police issued 545 citations for
misdemeanor offenses and made 140 arrests, Weigel said.
   Police prepared for the onslaught. The 82-officer Palm Springs
force is working 12-hour shifts all week and being supplemented
with officers from the California Highway Patrol and Riverside
County Sheriff's deputies.
   Officials were unable to estimate how many youths were in the
city of 36,000 permanent residents because many visitors stayed in
hotels outside the city, Weigel said.

<HEAD>US Offering Blunt Prescription for Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is sending
Panamanians the blunt message that their nation's crisis will end
if the military turns on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``Ultimately, I think it's going to have to be the (National)
Guard itself that gets rid of him,'' Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams said Sunday.
   Abrams, appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' expressed hope
that the military strongman would be forced out in ``a matter of
days.''
   Noriega has been indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury on drug
trafficking charges. The Reagan administration has demanded that
Noriega step down and go into exile.
   The New York Times, in today's editions, says administration
officials considered forcible extradition of Noriega to the United
States.
   Panamanian opposition leaders in Washington said they understood
from the administration and from leaders in Latin America that the
United States had considered seeking to have Noriega arrested in
Costa Rica, the newspaper said.
   The Times also said the Panamanian strongman had tried to
arrange a visit to Costa Rica over the weekend. According to senior
Latin American diplomats, the Times said, Noriega wanted to discuss
his political future with Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias
Sanchez and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
   Gonzalez was in Costa Rica over the weekend. Spain has offered
Noriega asylum if the United States agrees not to ask Madrid for
his extradition.
   Panamanian opposition leaders said Arias rejected Noriega's
request for a meeting and also refused to see a top deputy of the
general.
   Abrams, the State Department official in charge of Central and
Latin American policy, acknowledged that he is surprised the
military leader is still in power in the face of U.S. opposition
and a general strike at home.
   ``I guessed wrong. I thought he'd be gone by now,'' Abrams said.
``I think he's clinging at this point by his fingertips.''
   Abrams made the comments as he pointed out that Noriega has not
been able to pay his military supporters.
   On Saturday, bankers rejected a Panamanian government demand for
$70 million in their vaults. The government's attempt to secure the
funds came after it was unable to meet the 15,000-member military's
payroll.
   Noriega ordered a shake-up of his forces after a failed coup on
March 16. Over the weekend, he sent in troops and police to reopen
Panama City's flour mills in an attempt to break the general strike
aimed at ousting the military leader.
   The Panamanian government has been strapped for cash because of
economic sanctions taken by the United States. U.S. military aid to
Panama was suspended by Congress last year as the political
situation began to deteriorate.
   Abrams, however, said ``it's got to be the National Guard
itself'' that forces Noriega out of power. ``He just won't leave.
... He doesn't care about Panama. He doesn't care about the defense
forces. He doesn't care about the economy. He doesn't care about
the people.''
   Asked about any possible threat to U.S. citizens in the country,
Abrams said the United States intends to protect the 50,000
military people and civilians there.
   ``If there is a threat from Gen. Noriega, it won't last long,''
he said.
   Abrams, speaking with reporters following his television
appearance, was asked whether the United States would use its
military to protect its interests in Panama.
   ``We have an obligation to protect Americans in Panama, the
bases, and a treaty right and obligation to protect the (Panama)
Canal and we will do it,'' he responded.
   Abrams repeated administration assertions that an offer from the
Dominican Republic to give asylum to Noriega is not good enough,
and that it would be better if the military leader accepted a
similar offer from Spain.
   ``The way to end this crisis is to get him out of the country,''
Abrams said.

   Nicaraguan exiles and supporters prayed
for peace in a special outdoors Mass, but many worried that Contra
leaders had been too eager to sign a cease-fire agreement with the
Sandinistas.
   More than 300 people, palm fronds in hand, gathered in this
Nicaraguan enclave to pray in a special outdoors Palm Sunday Mass.
   ``All the deaths were for nothing if they signed a treaty in
just four hours,'' said Segundo Marenco, a member of the exile
group that organized the Mass. ``They haven't asked for the
retirement of Cuban troops from Nicaragua. It's just another way to
buy time for the Sandinistas.''
   ``We are looking for peace _ peace with freedom. The resistance
is going to continue to resist until their rights are respected,''
said retired Army Gen. John Singlaub, who has waged a public and
private battle to keep the Contras fighting.
   The gathering came a day after a handful of demonstrators _ one
who punched Contra official Enrique Sanchez in the mouth _
protested the cease-fire agreement outside a Miami hotel where
rebel leaders were holding closed-door meetings.
   ``The general feeling is confusion _ what will happen now in
Nicaragua,'' Roberto Serrano, an engineer who has worked as a wine
importer since leaving his homeland, said at the Mass. ``We have to
wait and see.''
   ``We want peace in Nicaragua, but we don't believe we have
enough guarantees to go back, for we believe the Sandinistas don't
like to be at peace inside Nicaragua,'' exile Eduardo Salgado said.
   Under the pact, which declares a cease-fire until June 1, the
Contras agreed not to accept any more U.S. military aid. In return,
the Sandinistas promised a gradual amnesty for Contras and
unrestricted freedom of expression that would allow them a role in
Nicaragua's political process.

   Share prices dropped on the London Stock Exchange
today morning as investors reacted to Friday's plunge on Wall

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 16.8
points, or 1 percent, to 1,751.1 by 11 a.m.
   Shares prices fell despite a recovery in Tokyo share prices
earlier today.
   However, dealers said the London market didn't have much
direction of its own, with little trading taking place ahead of the
extended Easter holiday weekend that will begin Friday.
   Major shares were down across the board, with some composite
insurance stocks showing the only rise.
   The early trend followed the sharp fall in New York Friday,
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.92 to 1,978.95, and
gains in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei index rose 301.99 to
25,622.71.

   An off-duty police officer pleaded with his
colleagues to kill him after he apparently fatally shot his
24-year-old wife, a sheriff's recruit, during a struggle over a
gun, neighbors said.
   Pablo J. Agrio, 29, a four-year veteran of the San Diego Police
Department, was being held today without bail in the death of Alma
Catalina, police said.
   He was booked for investigation of homicide, and the district
attorney's office will decide today what charges to file, said
police Officer Pete Westrick. However, investigators believe the
shooting was accidental, he said.
   April Montera, a neighbor of Agrio, said he greeted police in
tears after they responded Saturday night to an emergency call at
the Paradise Hills condominium.
   ``He was waving his arms and telling the cops to shoot him,''
said Mrs. Montera.
   Agrio told investigators that he and his wife exchanged blows
during an argument, and then his wife seized the gun and pointed it
at him, said Sgt. Anne O'Dell, a police spokeswoman.
   ``During the struggle over the handgun, the weapon discharged
and struck Mrs. Agrio in the head, killing her instantly,'' the
sergeant said.
   The weapon may have been the officer's firearm, O'Dell said.
   The couple's son, 18-month-old Pablolita, apparently slept
through the altercation, neighbors said.
   Alma Catalina, a recruit correctional officer at the San Diego
County Sheriff's Academy, was scheduled to graduate this spring.

<TEXT>
   A moderate offshore earthquake rattled the
Hawaiian Islands but caused no damage or injuries, authorities said.
   The temblor, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, struck at 5:33 p.m. Sunday about 35 miles west of Hawaii
Island. Fifteen minutes later, an aftershock of 4.1 was recorded.
   A 5.2 earthquake hit in the same area two days earlier.
   The strength of Sunday's quake was not great enough to generate
a tsunami, or tidal wave, said Richard Sillcox of the Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center.
   The temblor was unrelated to Kilauea, the world's most active
volcano, which has been in eruption on Hawaii Island since Jan. 3,
1983, said Tom Wright, scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 5.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 4.5.
   An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated
area, while a 6 can cause severe damage. The San Francisco
earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the Richter scale was
devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale.

<HEAD>China Announces Major Overhaul of Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government today announced a major
overhaul of its bureaucracy to streamline operations, eliminate
10,000 jobs and reduce its role in the direct management of the
economy.
   Song Ping, State Councillor and head of the Communist Party
Organization Department, outlined proposals under which 14
ministries under the State Council will be abolished, one redefined
and 10 new ones set up.
   It will mean a net reduction of five State Council organs from
the current 45, Song told a session of the National People's
Congress, China's parliament. The 10,000 staffers dropped from the
payroll will be transferred to other jobs.
   The new bodies should be set up within three months after being
approved during the current congressional session, but the process
of making the State Council more efficient and reducing overlapping
will take time, Song said.
   ``The functions of government offices and work methods cannot be
changed all at once and a new work order cannot be established at
once either,'' he said.
   Song said the reorganization was transitional and will lay the
groundwork for further restructuring of the State Council,
equivalent to China's Cabinet.
   The reorganization will address such problems as too rigid
micro-management and insufficient macro-control, overlapping
functions, overstaffing, low working efficiency and lack of clarity
about duties, the state councillor said.
   The reforms will reduce the staff directly under the State
Council from 50,000 to 40,000, he said.
   The government, as part of reforms to separate the functions of
government and business, will no longer manage enterprises
directly, as it has under Soviet-style central planning, Song said.
Instead, government organs will be responsible for general
planning, finances, supervision and regulation.
   The current annual session of the Congress, which convened last
week, is also to pass a law guaranteeing the rights of factory
managers to run their plants without undue interference from the
government.
   The 10 new bodies to be created are the ministries of personnel,
labor, materials, transportation, energy, construction, aeronautics
and astronautics industry, water resources, machine building and
electronics industry and the State Planning Commission.
   That commission, merging the current planning and economic
commissions, is to be a powerful body in charge of formulating
China's development strategies.
   Song said the new commission will no longer engage in direct
management of trade and industrial operations, as the two existing
commissions do. The commission is expected to be headed by veteran
economic expert and Vice Premier Yao Yilin, who heads the current
State Planning Commission.
   The Labor and Personnel Ministry will be split into two
ministries, with the new Labor Ministry responsible for overseeing
reforms in China's labor structure and the Personnel Ministry in
charge of introducing a state civil servant system.
   The new Transportation Ministry will combine the ministries of
railways and communications and the State Air Transport Control
Administration.
   China's antiquated and overtaxed transportation system has come
under strong criticism as a result of one air crash and four fatal
train crashes this year, killing 277 people.
   Song outlined the proposed Energy Ministry as encompassing the
work of the ministries of coal industry, petroleum industry and
nuclear industry.
   The official Xinhua News Agency will become a separate
institution under the State Council. Previously it was an
administrative organ listed as one of the 45 State Council units,
he said.
   He said the 10,000 people to be pared from State Council
payrolls will be transferred to units handling taxation, finance,
prices, auditing, supervision, statistics and law enforcement. Many
will join companies and institutions engaged in information,
consultancy and research, he said.
   Transferring workers to companies will raise efficiency,
eliminate bureaucracy and promote the introduction of a civil
service system, Song said.

<TEXT>
   A six-week-old sedition trial in which
white supremacists are accused of plotting to overthrow the
government by force could go to the all-white jury this week if the
defense completes its case.
   Prosecutors contend the 13 defendants conspired to replace the
federal government with an Aryan nation. The defendants say the
government is trying to silence its critics.
   The defense started presenting its case last week in the sixth
week of the trial and several defendants plan to take the stand.
   Prosecutors predicted when the trial began Feb. 16 that they
would spend two months and call 200 witnesses, but they rested
Monday after five weeks and 106 witnesses.
   U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold has repeatedly reminded the
jury, ``Mere disagreement with the government is not seditious
conspiracy.''
   Seditious conspiracy, he said, requires two or more persons to
plot to bring down the government by actions that produce, or are
likely to produce, imminent lawless action.
   The government contends the sedition defendants robbed,
counterfeited, bombed and murdered, and witnesses have testified
how money to do so was distributed.
   A key government witness, unindicted co-conspirator James
Ellison, led an Arkansas white supremacist group _ the Covenant,
the Sword and the Arm of the Lord _ until his arrest in 1985. He is
serving 20 years in prison.
   Ellison said defendant Louis Ray Beam Jr. called for war against
the government, and that co-defendant Robert Edward Miles provided
him with a 30-gallon barrel of cyanide that could be used to poison
the water of a large city like Washington, D.C., or New York City.
   Beam testified that the real issue in the trial was whether
there would be liberty or tyranny. ``In America today, dissidents
in some ways are treated as bad as dissidents in the Soviet
Union,'' he said.
   Miles says the government wants to silence him because he's a
gadfly. ``Sometimes the government gets out its flyswatter,'' Miles
said.
   Of the 14 defendants originally charged, 10 were accused of
seditious conspiracy; one was acquitted for lack of evidence. Five
defendants, including one of the sedition defendants, are accused
of plotting to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Two sedition
defendants are accused of the interstate transportation of stolen
money.

   Two men stole a locomotive and took it on a
three-mile joyride at speeds up to 50 mph before it derailed,
Chicago & North Western Railroad officials said.
   No injuries were reported in the derailment late Saturday on the
city's North Side, railroad spokesman Fred Bloedorn said.
   The unidentified men boarded the 1,500-horsepower, 112-ton
freight locomotive at a rail yard and fled after a rail tower
operator switched it to another rail yard and it jumped the tracks
because of its speed, he said.
   The 25-year-old locomotive, valued at $100,000 to $150,000, was
badly dented when it fell on its side, but crews were not
immediately able to determine how much repairs will cost, he said.

<DATELINE>SHELTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three prison escapees, including a triple
murderer, were back in custody today after allegedly stealing three
vehicles, robbing a family and stealing a handgun, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in the crime spree Sunday.
   Sheriff's officers who had been on the lookout for the inmates
since they escaped Wednesday spotted them on U.S. 101 near Shelton
when their southbound car abruptly turned and headed north, said
Lt. Howard Armfield of the Mason County Sheriff's Department.
   With officers in pursuit, the car veered off the highway and
onto Washington 3, where it was surrounded by five sheriff's
vehicles just outside of Shelton, about 15 miles northwest of
Olympia.
   The prisoners left the car peacefully with their hands behind
their heads, leaving the stolen weapon stuffed under a car seat,
Armfield said.
   ``They didn't have anywhere to go and they knew it,'' he said.
``They apparently weren't out to hurt anybody. All they were out
for was a ride.''
   The inmates were taken to the county jail before being
transferred back to the Washington Corrections Center.
   ``It was real apparent they didn't have any outside help and
they didn't have a plan,'' Sheriff Bob Holter said. ``We didn't
know they were still here.''
   The men escaped Wednesday night after apparently scaling a chain
link fence topped with three feet of razor-sharp ``ribbon wire''
near an unoccupied guard tower, prison spokeswoman Barbara Lovelace
said.
   The inmates hid in a shed near a family's home, Armfield said.
Armed with a gun they found in the shed, they confronted the
family, robbed them and stole their truck, he said. They later
stole two other cars.
   The inmates likely will face first-degree escape charges, three
counts each of grand theft and three counts each of armed robbery,
Armfield said.
   Sean Stevenson, 17, was convicted of two counts of first-degree
murder and one count of aggravated first-degree murder in the
deaths of his mother, stepfather and sister. He was serving a life
term without possibility of parole.
   With him were Gary Curtis Van Winkle, 17, of Seattle, convicted
of attempted murder and burglary in King County and Patrick J.
Rice, 23, of North Bend, convicted of second-degree burglary and
one count of taking a motor vehicle without permission.

<HEAD>Falwell Starts Petition Drive For Oliver North Pardon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has launched a
petition drive to press for a presidential pardon for Oliver North,
saying the government is using the fired National Security Council
aide as a scapegoat in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Falwell announced the petition drive Sunday to his congregation
at Thomas Road Baptist Church.
   Falwell said North, who was indicted earlier this month for his
role in the Iran-Contra affair, was only following orders and
trying to do what a ``spineless Congress'' wouldn't do in Central
America.
   ``I decided we didn't have any hope with the independent counsel
and the 250 staff members, who are being paid with millions of our
tax dollars to hang this man, to imprison this man. We can't win
there,'' Falwell said, referring to special prosecutor Lawrence E.
Walsh.
   ``We can't win in the Congress,'' he said. ``We've long since
abrogated a Congress that has enough statesmen in it to make a
difference. The majority of them are more committed to the next
election than the next generation.
   ``But, we can appeal to the court of public opinion,'' Falwell
said. ``And I've decided to put together a national pardon petition
to the president of the United States, and see if I could find 2 or
3 million people who would sign with me.''
   Falwell's petition says North, who just retired as a Marine
Corps lieutenant colonel, fought communism in Central America and
in the process became the object of terrorist death threats.
   ``The least our country can do is to free him from the cloud of
persecution that hangs over his head and that of his family,'' it
says.
   Falwell said he would deliver the signed list personally to
Reagan.
   In an interview following the church service, Falwell said he
expects critics to accuse him of once again using his position to
influence governmental matters. He said, however, he is not acting
in his capacity as the leader of the church or or the Moral
Majority.
   ``I'm doing this only as a citizen who appreciates what this man
has done for me and my children,'' he said.

   Iran said today its Revolutionary Guards
killed or wounded 300 Iraqis in a battle in northeast Iraq and now
hold more than 500 square miles of the strategic Kurdistan region.
   Also today, Iran attacked two supertankers in the Persian Gulf,
setting them ablaze, and Iraqi-backed rebels claimed several
thousand of their fighters attacked Iranian troops in southwest
Iran.
   Iraq has admitted losing some territory in Kurdistan. If the
Iranian claim is confirmed, it would mark Iraq's biggest military
setback in the 7{-year-old war since the Iranians battled to within
six miles of Basra 13 months ago.
   Iran said its troops in Kurdistan were within three miles of a
hydroelectric dam supplying most of the power for the region as
well as electricity for Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. The fighting
also was reportedly within 70 miles of oilfields producing more
than half of Iraq's total output, vital to the country's war effort.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said the Iranians _ who have thrust into the Kurdistan mountains in
a 13-day-old offensive _ ``fiercely repelled'' a counter-attack by
Iraq's 5th Army Corps around Lake Darbandikhan during the night.
   Amid another wave of Iraqi air raids on towns in western Iran,
the Iranians said their fighter planes shot down two Iraqi
warplanes in the Kurdistan battle zone today.
   The Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels said their National Liberation
Army launched a major offensive on a 14-mile front in Iran's
Khuzestan province near the town of Shush.
   The rebels claimed in a communique issued in Baghdad that 15
brigades pushed across the border to drive Iranian forces out of
positions and were threatening a highway southwest of the garrison
city of Dezful.
   The communique reported heavy Iranian casualties with ``a large
number of tanks captured.'' There was no independent confirmation.
   The Iranian rebels said the assault involved several thousand
fighters and was the biggest it mounted since it launched a
campaign against the Iranian regime a year ago.
   In the gulf, Iranian gunboats today attacked the 337,733-ton
Danish supertanker Karama Maersk off the southern emirate of
Sharjah, setting it on fire, gulf-based shipping executives
reported.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit reported there were no
casualties on the vessel.
   Three hours later, the gunboats attacked the 219,287-ton
Norwegian-operated tanker Golar Kansai in the same area and set it
ablaze, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was not immediately known if there were any casualties aboard
the Norwegian tanker. Salvage tugs went to aid the stricken vessels.
   Also today, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
two U.N. officials, Dr. Manuel Carmona and James Holger, arrived in
Tehran to probe Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons against
three Kurdish towns in Iraq.
   The Iranians claimed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were killed and 5,000
injured two weeks ago when Iraqi warplanes dropped cyanide and
mustard gas bombs on the towns after they had been captured in the
Iranian offensive.
   The reported chemical attacks sparked protests in the West. In
Washington about 100 people stoned the Iraqi Embassy and about 50
Kurds protested outside an Iraqi mission in Vienna on Sunday.
   In London today, about 200 Kurds ended a peaceful candelight
vigil outside the U.S. Embassy but refused to hand over a petition
demanding U.S. action after embassy officials declined to meet with
them.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi was quoted today by IRNA
as saying Iran's offensive in Iraq ``has brought the possibility of
an Iranian military victory and punishment of the aggressor
closer.''
   The agency quoted Revolutionary Guards Minister Mohsen
Rafiq-Doust as saying in Tehran after a Cabinet meeting Sunday that
the Iranians have overrun 540 square miles of Iraqi territory.
   The Iranians have pushed about 15 miles into the Lake
Darbandikhan area, Iranian communiques said. They claim to have
killed or wounded nearly 13,500 Iraqis, captured more than 5,000
and destroyed 225 tanks and armored vehicles in fighting since
March 16.
   The Iranians said they have seized the eastern and southern
shores of Lake Darbandikhan, cutting off large number of Iraqis.
   Iran reported its troops were within three miles of the
hydroelectric dam on the southern end of the 10-mile-long lake
after capturing the Shaakh Shamshir heights overlooking the dam.
   Iran said the front line lies 70 miles east of the Kirkuk
oilfields, which produce 1.5 million barrels of oil a day.

<HEAD>Report: 26 Journalists Killed, 59 Assaulted, 180 Arrested in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-six journalists were killed last year
while covering the news, a jump of 11 over 1986, according to a
report by a journalists' group. Eleven of the deaths occurred in
the Philippines.
   The report released Sunday by the Committee to Protect
Journalists also listed 59 assaults on journalists and more than
185 arrests or kidnappings of journalists.
   Eleven journalists were forced to leave their own countries
under threats, and 32 foreign journalists were expelled from the
countries where they were working, the committee also said.
   ``These figures are a grim reminder that even in the midst of a
worldwide communications revolution, some still feel the temptation
to kill the messenger,'' said committee chairman Josh Friedman.
   In 1986, the committee documented the killings of 15
journalists, 56 assaults and more than 190 arrests or kidnappings.
Another 37 journalists were expelled, and eight left countries
under threat.
   In the Philippines, the committee said, most attacks against
journalists ``took place within a series of retaliatory actions
perpetrated by guerillas on one side, and military and paramilitary
(or vigilante) personnel on the other.''
   Five of the 11 killed in the Philippines, more than any other
country, were killed Aug. 27 by armed men who broke into a radio
station. The victims reportedly had ties with an anti-communist
radio commentator.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists is a non-profit,
non-partisan organization founded in 1981 by a group of American
reporters and editors.

   An uneasy truce reigned between
surfers and fishermen after the two sides fought over the right to
use the waters around a popular jetty.
   The two groups hurled obscenities, bottles, lead sinkers and
fists at each other Friday after surfers accused fishermen of
deliberately casting their hooks and lines too close to them.
   The Brevard County Sheriff's office broke up the fight and
posted a deputy on the disputed jetty at Sebastian Inlet State
Recreational Park, which lies about 80 miles southeast of Orlando.
There were no arrests.
   Deputy Jeff Ludwig said fishermen often cast off the jetty's
north railing while surfers frequently come within 10 years of the
jetty. But Ludwig reported no problems over the weekend as surfers
stayed 40 yards north of the jetty while fishermen cast their lines
mostly from the south side.
   ``It's probably because I'm standing here,'' Ludwig said.
   Tom Cross, 32, a surfer from nearby Melbourne Beach, agreed.
   ``I think with that sheriff's deputy out there on the jetty,
people are going to be a little more careful how they cast,'' Cross
said.
   Fishermen claim the jetty is the best fishing spot around and
say surfers can ride the waves elsewhere.
   ``People should show a little consideration for one another,''
said Gary Hoover, who admitted he intentionally hooked a surfer
once for entering his fishing spot.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said Hoover, 27, of nearby Satellite Beach.
``You've only got how many miles of beach in Florida and only a
couple of spots where fishermen like to fish. I don't think they
should be surfing this close to the jetty.''

   Jackie Pflug suffered permanent brain
damage when she was shot in the head and left for dead by Arab
terrorists during a 1985 airplane hijacking in Malta. Today, she's
able to say she's glad it happened.
   It's ``not a hijacking story. It's a story of survival, of
learning about yourself,'' said Pflug, 32, whose brain injury
impaired her ability to read, wiped out her short-term memory and
caused epileptic seizures.
   In the 2{ years since the hijacking, Pflug says she has learned
to accept the fact that she lived while 59 other people, including
four of the five hijackers, died. And she has learned to love her
new self.
   Now she is taking a year's leave of absence from her job
teaching learning-disabled children and first-graders in nearby
Wayzata to tell her story on the lecture circuit.
   Pflug, a teacher at the American School in Cairo, where her
husband, Scott, also taught, was returning to Cairo from Athens
when the EgyptAir jetliner was hijacked on Nov. 24, 1985, just 15
minutes into the flight.
   The worst moment, Pflug said, was the very first one.
   ``The man stood up with the gun and the grenades. He was
grimacing and pulling at the grenades with his mouth and I had the
realization that this was a hijacking and I thought, `We're going
to blow up in the air,''' she said.
   After the plane landed, Pflug was among two Israelis and three
Americans who were tied and taken to the front of the plane one by
one. They were each shot, and their bodies pushed out the door onto
the pavement.
   Pflug, one of two Americans who survived the shootings, was hit
in the back ot the head but the bullet failed to penetrate her
skull. She lay still on the pavement for five hours before Maltese
workers were allowed to remove the bodies to the morgue, where
workers turned her over and found she was alive.
   ``They started screaming, `She's alive.' I said, `Are you the
good guys or the bad guys?''' Pflug recalled.
   While Pflug underwent surgery in Malta to have the bullet
removed from her skull and bits of bone from her brain, Egyptian
commandos stormed the plane as hijackers tossed grenades at the
passengers and the pilot killed the terrorist leader with a fire
ax. When it was over, 59 people were dead.
   Pflug was later transferred to a hospital in West Germany, then
came to Minnesota, where her husband's parents live, for more
treatment at University of Minnesota Hospital.
   ``I'm classified as severely disabled. It's a hidden handicap
because I look so normal that people can't tell there's anything
wrong with me. It appears as if I'm not listening,'' Pflug told the
Star Tribune of Minneapolis.
   Her epileptic seizures are controlled by medication and Pflug is
able to teach again, but her husband grades the papers because her
reading ability is impaired.
   The psychological problems caused by the hijacking have been
difficult to overcome, Pflug said, but therapy has helped.
   Pflug said not a day has gone by that she hasn't thought about
the hijacking.
   ``I see a man who looks like one of the hijackers. Or I hear a
voice like one of the children on the plane. Or I see a gun,'' said
Pflug. But those thoughts have been changing lately, partly the
result of therapy, she said.
   ``I think about it, but it doesn't get under my skin in the same
way. It doesn't control me. I control it,'' she said.
   Now Pflug wants to share her experiences with others in hopes
that she can help them. ``I'd like to motivate people to take
charge of their lives because life is just so wonderful. I know
that now,'' she said.
   ``So yes, I am glad it happened. I know, that's a pretty bold
thing to say. But you have to go through the bad part to get to the
good.''

   Gunmen seriously wounded the mayor of
a Manila suburb and killed seven of his bodyguards today in the
bloodiest attack in the capital blamed on communist rebels. Gunmen
also shot dead a businessman.
   Police said Mayor Prospero Oreta of suburban Malabon suffered
three gunshot wounds in the mouth, chest and arm but was out of
danger after surgery. Seven of his bodyguards died in the attack
and another was in serious condition.
   The ambush occurred as military units in various parts of the
country were on full alert in anticipation of stepped up rebel
attacks marking Tuesday's 19th founding anniversary of the now
24,000-member communist New People's Army.
   Seven hours after the ambush, three men in a car shot a
businessman while he was driving in suburban Quezon City, just
north of Manila, police said. The victim, who died at a hospital,
was identified as Francisco Castro.
   Police said they had no idea who his attackers were or what
their motive was. But the victim's brother, Jose Castro, vice
president of the Manila chapter of the leftist People's Party, told
reporters he believed he was the real target.
   Radio and newspaper reports said police Manila had received a
call from the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the communist guerrilla unit
operating in the Manila area, claiming responsibility for the
ambush on Oreta. Police declined to confirm the reports.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo confirmed such a call
had been received, but added the army could not yet say if the
guerrilla unit was behind the attack.
   The Alex Boncayao Brigade has been blamed for the killings of
more than 150 policemen and soldiers in daylight ambushes on
Manila's streets since last year. Before today, the attacks have
killed one or two people. The rebels had announced they would soon
kill officials as well as police and soldiers.
   President Corazon Aquino said she was ``shocked and saddened by
these acts of violence.''
   ``I have always asked our people to resort to the ways of
peace,'' she said in a statement. ``My hope is that as democracy in
our country gains a strong foothold, violence and terror will
gradually rescind.''
   Investigators said Oreta and his party were riding in a van and
a car to a flag-raising ceremony at the Malabon town hall when six
men waiting at an intersection opened fire with automatic weapons.
   Cpl. Mario Odulio said the killers were armed with AK-47 and
M-16 automatic assault rifles as well as 9-mm and .45-caliber
pistols. Police recovered more than 40 spent shells at the scene,
Odulio said. He said the killers escaped aboard a van and a jeep.
   Police said they believed the killers belonged to the Sparrow
Unit, an assassination squad of the New People's Army, but were
also looking into the possibility local politics was involved.
   Malabon, a fishing community in Manila's northern suburbs, was
among the places where last January's local elections were hotly
contested.
   Oreta is a brother-in-law of Rep. Tessie Oreta, younger sister
of Mrs. Aquino's assassinated husband, former Sen. Benigno S.
Aquino Jr.

   A man on trial for attempted capital murder and
aggravated robbery fired his attorney because she wasn't making
enough courtroom mistakes and took up his own defense, the lawyer
said.
   Jerome Anthony Johnson, 23, who studied criminal justice in
college, fired Yung-Sung Choe because she ``wasn't making enough
`reversible errors''' that would help him get a new trial in an
appeals court, Ms. Choe said Friday.
   ``He said he planned it even before he was arrested,'' she said.
``He told people, `If they catch me, this is what I'm going to
do.'''
   Johnson was sentenced Friday to 47 years in prison, half what he
could have received.
   ``It came out good then,'' Johnson told Ms. Choe after state
District Judge Frances Maloney read the jury's verdict.
   Johnson was charged with robbing a 53-year-old woman and her
80-year-old mother in November. Neither woman was injured, but
prosecutors said Johnson accidentally shot an accomplice as he
fired at one of the women.
   About noon Wednesday, Johnson interrupted Ms. Choe's
cross-examination of a witness and asked Maloney to allow him to
represent himself.
   Dressed in a suit, Johnson questioned several witnesses and
objected to actions by the prosecution before explaining to Ms.
Choe what he planned.
   ``I couldn't let him commit fraud upon the court,'' Ms. Choe
said. So she told the judge.
   Maloney sent the jury out of the room and told Johnson he
couldn't make intentional mistakes to build grounds for an appeal.
   ``I explained to him that normally a person could not
deliberately make an error and then profit by that error,'' Maloney
said. ``After explaining all that, I said, `Do you understand?' And
he wouldn't answer me.''
   For the next day and a half, Johnson stayed silent and allowed
the prosecution to proceed with no interuptions. When the verdict
came in, Johnson was happy and the court reporter congratulated him.
   ``Weird things happen,'' Maloney said. ``That's why there are
courts, I guess.''

<HEAD>August Wilson's `Joe Turner's Come and Gone' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a Pittsburgh boardinghouse in 1911, the
children and grandchildren of slavery grapple with a world that
won't let them forget the past and denies them the future.
   It is the setting for ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' August
Wilson's heartfelt and haunting tale of a church deacon's obsessive
search for his missing wife as well as for his identity as a black
man.
   The play, which opened Sunday at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore
Theater, is Wilson's third work to arrive in New York since 1984.
Following ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and ``Fences,'' it reaffirms
and enlarges his reputation as a major American playwright.
   ``Joe Turner'' is Wilson's most ambitious play. In it, he blends
African mysticism with compelling, naturalistic drama. The
production, beautifully directed by Lloyd Richards, is rich in
poetry, humor and an almost visionary sense of time, place and
character.
   The story unfolds slowly. Wilson weaves his spell gradually.
It's his steady accumulation of detail that fascinates and finally
mesmerizes.
   Some memorable figures live in this homey boardinghouse, run by
Seth Holly, an ambitious entrepreneur, and his hard-working,
good-natured wife, Bertha. The audience gets to know them all. In
this play, more so than in ``Ma Rainey'' or ``Fences,'' even the
minor characters have lives of their own.
   Chief among the boardinghouse inhabitants is Bynum Walker, a
self-styled ``conjurin' man'' who believes in incantations, the
beneficial effects of roots and herbs, blood sacrifice and voodoo.
He is a link to a black man's African past, although his magic has
been Americanized. Bynum sacrifices the neighbor's pigeons and uses
weeds from Seth's garden as healing herbs.
   Also living in the house is Jeremy Furlow, a hot-headed young
man, recently arrived from the South and not yet aware that things
won't be much different up North. He takes up with Mattie Campbell,
a frail woman who visits the voodoo man for help in finding her
lost mate and decides to stay instead. She stands in contrast to
another resident, Molly Cunningham, a resolutely realistic woman
who knows she can't expect much out of life.
   Into the lives of these transients comes a strange, menacing man
wearing a long black coat and traveling with his young daughter.
Herald Loomis is looking for his wife, Martha. The couple was
separated years earlier when Loomis was forced into a chain gang by
the infamous, real-life bounty hunter, Joe Turner.
   Loomis believes his wife is in the Pittsburgh area. With the
help of Bynum and a white traveling salesman named Rutherford
Selig, he intends to find her.
   The deacon, described aptly by Bynum as ``a man in search of his
own song,'' is the play's most disturbing character. It's his story
that brings each of the play's two acts to dramatic conclusions. At
the end of Act 1, the stage erupts in a joyous religious dance
called a ``juba.'' During this mystical and spiritual frenzy,
Loomis has visions of the not-so-distant past, a time of slavery
and ``bones walking on water.''
   It's not until the second act that Loomis finally confronts his
wife and then slashes himself with a knife to exorcise the ghosts
of long ago. It's not a sacrifice but rather a cleansing, enabling
Loomis to face the future. Whether he and his wife will be able to
pick up the pieces of their severed marriage is unclear but at
least they will be able to try.
   Richards, who also directed ``Fences'' and ``Ma Rainey,'' gets
some fine ensemble work out of his large cast. Particularly
impressive are Delroy Lindo as the tormented deacon, Ed Hall as the
homespun magic man and Mel Winkler as the exasperated boardinghouse
owner. Wilson has also written a tender, funny scene for two
children, and Richards has coaxed two beautiful performances from
Richard Parnell Habersham and Jamila Perry.
   The warm, solid boardinghouse setting by Scott Bradley is capped
by a splendid rooftop view of Pittsburgh and a bridge spanning the
entire stage. It's an evocative reminder that most of the people in
this home are travelers, displaced from the South and still not
comfortable in the North.
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' is one more piece in the mosaic
Wilson is creating about black life in 20th century America, one
play for each decade. ``Fences'' is set in the 1950s, while ``Ma
Rainey'' takes place in the 1920s. ``Joe Turner'' may be set even
further in the past, but it is a play that resonates with such
feeling that it leaps across the years to speak powerfully and
movingly to today.
   Among other critics, Frank Rich of The New York Times said that
Wilson ``has once again shown us how in another man's freedom we
find our own.'' The play is Wilson's ``most profound and
theatrically adventurous telling of his story to date,'' Rich wrote.
   ``Here is a lovely, moving play that carries you with it like a
matchbox on a flood,'' wrote Clive Barnes of the New York Post.
   Linda Winer of New York Newsday was equally impressed. ``Joe
Turner'' is August Wilson's ``best play yet _ which means it's a
stunner,'' she wrote. The play has ``a breadth that connects the
dots of neglected history into a picture we will never forget
again.''
   But Howard Kissel of the Daily News said while there are
``scenes of great power,'' ``you feel that in his eagerness to
envision a place where reconcilations abound, Wilson has minimized
the conflict the characters and the period require.''

<HEAD>State Police Say Howard Rollins Jr. Arrested On Drug, Traffic
Charges
^Eds: CORRECTS dateline to Baton Rouge, where arrested occurred.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard Rollins Jr., co-star of the NBC
series ``Heat of the Night,'' was arrested on drug and traffic
charges after being stopped for going more than 100 mph on an
interstate, authorities said.
   A state trooper who stopped the actor early Sunday said he found
two bags of a rock-like substance suspected of being cocaine in
Rollins' coat pockets. Rollins' blood alcohol level also was above
the legal limit for intoxication, according to a breath test, he
said.
   The actor was charged with possessing cocaine, first-offense
drunken driving and speeding, and was released on $5,000 bond.
   There was no answer to a telephone call to Rollins' room at the
Hammond Holiday Inn.
   Rollins, who co-starred as Chief of Detectives Virgil Tibbs in
the two-hour television remake of ``Heat of the Night'' and in a
six-part series of the same name, had a commission as a sheriff's
deputy, said Senior Trooper Allen Coburn, who arrested the actor.
   ``He had a badge holder with a Livingston Parish Sheriff's
Office badge and a full commission from the sheriff,'' Coburn said.
``He didn't say anything about it, but he made sure I saw it while
he was getting his driver's license.''
   Rollins, 37, of Baltimore, told police he was in Hammond to make
a movie. ``Heat of the Night'' was filmed in Hammond.
   Coburn said he spotted Rollins' car traveling east on Interstate
12 at a little over 100 mph. Rollins pulled his car to the side of
the interstate and offered no resistance, Coburn said.
   ``He took his coat off while doing the sobriety test. After the
test, I picked up the coat, checked the pockets for weapons and
found two bags of suspected cocaine,'' Coburn said. Each bag
appeared to hold about one-eighth of an ounce of a rock-like
substance, he said.
   Coburn said a breath test indicated that Rollins' blood alcohol
level was 0.15 percent. The law sets intoxication as 0.10 percent
or more.
   Rollins' court date probably will be set in six to eight weeks.
   In addition to ``Heat of the Night,'' in which Carroll O'Connor
co-stars, Rollins' films include ``Ragtime'' in 1981, in which he
was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and
``A Soldier's Story'' in 1984.
   In 1985, Rollins starred as a ruthless cocaine dealer in the
television movie ``The Children of Times Square.''

   When he was down and out, on the heels of the
Donna Rice scandal, Gary Hart quit the Democratic campaign and, in
practically the same breath, made the case for something called
``national service.''
   ``I would say to the young people of this country, the torch of
idealism burns bright in your hearts,'' said Hart. ``It should lead
you to public service and national service. It should lead you to
want to make this country better.''
   That was May 1987. On Feb. 29, 1988, Hart was back in the race
but as evidenced at the polls, no one was really listening.
   And so the call for ``national service'' was hardly a burning
issue when Sen. Sam Nunn addressed the Democratic Leadership
Council in Williamsburg, Va. _ and urged the setting up of a
``citizens corps'' to perform voluntary national service.
   The plan could well emerge as a cornerstone of the Democratic
presidential campaign, the 1988 version of John Kennedy's 1960 call
to create a Peace Corps to perform good work overseas.
   It's a ``something for something'' approach to government.
   Young people would commit themselves to public service _ be it
military service or civilian social service _ in return for living
expenses plus a $10,000-a-year voucher. ``Like the G.I. bill,''
Nunn said, the benefits could be used to cover school costs,
vocational training or a home-ownership subsidy.
   The proposal is not new to the presidential campaign. Not only
was it one of Hart's cornerstone ``new ideas,'' but Paul Simon and
Bruce Babbitt also embraced the concept in their campaigns, and on
the Republican side, Alexander Haig Jr. proposed such a program
before he dropped out.
   Hart, Babbitt, Simon, Nunn and Haig. All well and good. But the
proposal won't go anywhere unless one of the nominees adopts it as
his own and the Democratic Leadership Council has laid considerable
groundwork.
   The DLC is the group of moderate Democrats who helped dream up
the Southern regional primaries and hoped the 1988 process would
swing the Democratic party into the political center.
   ``I am convinced that national service can revitalize the spirit
of civic responsibility and enterprise that built this nation and
remains its greatest strength,'' Nunn said.
   Among the goals of the DLC program, Nunn said, are:
   _To increase the number of military volunteers and help remedy
``some of our most urgent social problems, like widespread
illiteracy and inadequate child care and health care.''
   _``Offer a decentralized and non-bureaucratic way to deliver
human services to needy citizens.''
   _``The DLC plan would link federal student aid to national
service,'' he said, contending the program thus would be a ``road
to opportunity and upward mobility for our young people.''
   Anticipating the first question about such a plan, Nunn added,
``Such a program, of course, won't be free. Nothing worthwhile ever
is.
   ``I believe, however, that a large portion of the costs of this
program (estimated in some quarters at $6 billion a year) can be
financed by shifting federal funds already being expended on
student aid.'' In the long run, he said, ``the program, like the
G.I. bill, will return huge revenues to the Treasury because every
additional college graduate in America will earn $640,000 more over
their working life as compared to someone who doesn't go to
college.''
   Nunn's concept and the idealistic appeal from Hart recall
Kennedy's Peace Corps, an enduring element of his legacy even 25
years after his death.

<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in West Germany and
Switzerland have arrested 11 people suspected of spying for the
Soviet Union, authorities said today.
   German Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said 10 people were taken
into custody in West Germany last week. In Switzerland, the Swiss
Federal Prosecutor's Office said today a foreigner had been
arrested last Wednesday.
   Rebmann said six of the 10 suspects captured in West Germany
remained in jail today, including two teachers, three engineers and
a businessman.
   Swiss prosecutors said they had launched a criminal probe into
activities of the arrested foreigner, an engineer living in Zurich.
The suspect was arrested on a tip from West Germany, prosecutors
said, declining to disclose his name or nationality.
   Rebmann called the arrests ``a heavy blow against the KGB,'' the
Kremlin's main intelligence agency.
   Speaking at a news conference, he said the West German arrests
occurred Wednesday and Thursday in police raids on 33 different
locations. A total of 169 police carried out the raids, Rebmann
said.
   Two of the suspects _ identified only as doctors _ were freed
shortly after police took them into custody, he said. Two other
suspects were freed in the following days, but the investigation
against the four was continuing, he said.
   Rebmann said three of the jailed suspects were Soviet emigres,
but none were Soviet citizens.
   He said the arrests marked ``an important penetration of the KGB
spy network in West Germany.''
   Rebmann also said a government secretary arrested March 18 on
suspicion of spying had been working for the KGB. It was the first
time the woman, Elke Falk, was linked to the Soviets.
   Ms. Falk worked in federal ministries for several years and had
access to secret information.
   Gerhard Boeden, president of the federal Ministry for the
Protection of the Constitution _ the West German
counter-intelligence agency _ said West German intelligence
officials had developed new ways to uncover East Bloc spies. He
refused to elaborate.
   West German authorities identified 15 communist agents between
August and December 1985. Some were arrested, others escaped.
   Rebmann identified the six jailed suspects as 44-year-old
businessman Helmut Stefan Kolasch; a Colombian engineer identified
by Rebmann only as ``Amaya;'' Peter Friesen, a 33-year-old
engineer; George Bender, 37, also an engineer; Shimon Or, a
48-year-old teacher; and another teacher, Edmund Neufert, 37.
   Friesen, Bender and Neufert are Soviet emigres, Rebmann said.
All six suspects had been living in West Germany, he said.
   Kolasch allegedly gave the KGB technological secrets about
NATO's Tornado and Jaeger warplanes while working for firms dealing
with the aircraft, Rebmann said.
   Kolasch has been working for the KGB since 1971, Rebmann said.
   Rebmann said Amaya also handed over unidentified technical
documents, Friesen spied on West German political parties, Bender
reported to the KGB about an electronics concern he worked for and
Neufert spied on students while teaching Russian at the Foreign
Ministry's language-training office.
   Rebmann said Or ``reported (to the KGB) on his own life and
work,'' but he did not provide details.
   The suspects apparently were operating individually, Rebmann
said.

<HEAD>Kurds Protest Use Of Chemical Weapons In Iraq</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators angered by reported Iraqi
chemical weapons attacks on Kurds forced their way into the Iraqi
Embassy in Vienna today, smashing windows and pushing around
embassy workers. Police said 64 protesters were arrested.
   Six shots were fired, but police said no injuries were reported.
   As many as 70 people took part in the demonstration, which began
at 10:20 a.m., police and demonstrators said. The arrests ended the
protest two hours later.
   A demonstrator told Austrian radio a delegation wanted to speak
to Iraqi officials to protest the use of chemical weapons in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran said last week that the Iraqi air force dropped cyanide and
mustard gas bombs on three Kurdish towns in Iraq, killing 5,000
Kurds and injuring 5,000 other people. The attacks on the towns,
which had been captured in an Iranian offensive, occurred March 16
and 17.
   Police said some demonstrators forced their way into the
building and ``shoved'' embassy personnel, but embassy security
guards forced the protesters out of the building.
   The demonstrator, who was not identified, told Austrian radio
that a man with a machine gun, apparently an embassy security
guard, fired shots into the streets from inside the embassy
building.
   Police said at least six shots had been fired inside the
building.
   Demonstrators smashed windows at the embassy, police and
demonstrators said.
   The Iraqi Embassy refused to comment on the incident.
   In London, meanwhile, hundreds of Kurds protesting Iraq's
alleged use of chemical weapons held a vigil outside the U.S.
Embassy but left today without delivering their petition. The
chemical attacks also sparked protests in Washington on Sunday in
which about 100 people stoned the Iraqi Embassy.
   Two U.N. officials reportedly arrived in Tehran today to
investigate the attacks on the Kurdish towns.
   About 220 of the 500 Kurds who marched through central London
late Sunday spent the night outside the Grosvenor Square embassy,
Scotland Yard reported. Both the march and the candlelight vigil
were peaceful.
   An Iraqi Embassy press officer in London said the Kurds refused
to give their petition to an official who met them this morning.
   ``The demonstrators wanted to engage in a dialogue with somebody
rather than just have somebody passively received a petition,'' the
press officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   He said there was no one available at the embassy to speak with
the Kurds ``so they refused to hand in their petition.''
   Scotland Yard reported the demonstrators arrived at the embassy
about 2:30 a.m. after a three-hour march and rally. The embassy
said they left about 11 a.m.
   The demonstrators said many of them had lost relatives in
chemical weapons attacks.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayors of Panama City and its
largest suburb today threatened to crack down on a mass
demonstration aimed at ousting Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
ending the worst crisis in the nation's history.
   In a communique published in this morning's state-run
newspapers, the mayors said they had instructed ``competent
authorities'' to enforce a ban on public demonstrations.
   Those authorities are the police and soldiers commanded by
Noriega.
   But opposition leaders said they would proceed with plans for
the afternoon protest march and called the ban illegal.
   The protest march comes at the start of the second week of a
general strike that has shut down an estimated 90 percent of the
nation's industry and commerce, further aggravating a critical cash
shortage.
   On Palm Sunday, Roman Catholic church leaders said government
authorities ``fear this explosion of sentiments'' and appealed to
both sides to show restraint. The church leaders said in a
statement they would send observers to today's march in Panama City
to try to keep the peace.
   Police and soldiers, under Noriega who heads the 15,000-member
Defense Forces, have suppressed recent demonstrations with tear gas
and shotguns.
   Also Sunday, the Social Security Institute said it will pay its
55,000 retirees up to $150 of their semi-monthly pension benefits
this week. They had threatened to join today's march if they didn't
receive their payments.
   Last week, the government was without money to pay the members
of the Defense Forces and faces another $33 million payroll for its
130,000 civilian employees this week, raising the possibility of
intensified protests.
   In Washington, Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of state
for inter-American affairs, predicted on Sunday that many of the
marchers will be ``members of the families of the Defense Forces.''
   The government on Sunday expelled a reporter for the French news
agency Agence France Press because his visa had been issued a
Panamanian consular official in Washington loyal to deposed
President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Opposition figures crticized the government for its planned
crackdown on the demonstration.
   ``Peaceful protest is a right written in the constitution,''
opposition leader Jose Faundes said Sunday. ``It is above any
decree, any law.''
   ``We hope they realize they cannot repress the will of the
people,'' said Aurelio Barria, a leader of the National Civic
Crusade, a coalition of more than 200 business, professional, labor
and student groups. ``This will be a physical expression of protest
against Noriega.''
   The crusade said the march would begin in front of the Church of
Don Bosco near the center of Panama City and proceed to a park
about half a mile away.
   The latest government crisis began last month when the Noriega
controlled Leislative Assembly deposed Delvalle after he tried to
fire Noriega.
   Noriega had recently been indicted in Florida on drug
trafficking charges.
   The United States responded to Delvalle's ouster by freezing
Panamanian assets in the United States and reiterating its support
for Delvalle as the chief executive. President Reagan has also
called on Noriega to resign.
   There were violent demonstrations 12 days ago after the
goverment was unable to meet payrolls and a small group of
disenchanted Defense Forces officers staged an unsuccessful coup
against Noriega.
   In its toughest action, soldiers loyal to Noriega seized two
major flour mills Saturday, including a plant owned by the General
Mills Corp., and confiscated 1.3 million pounds of ground wheat and
corn valued at $227,500.
   Owners of the mills had responded to a government announcement
of its plan to confiscate their plants by saying they would instead
donate their entire stocks of flour to the Catholic church's food
program for the poor.
   The church quickly thanked the mills ``for such a humanitarian
gesture,'' but soldiers seized the plants and moved the flour to
government warehouses before it could be delivered to Caritas, the
church's welfare agency.
   Also Saturday, soldiers reopened Panama City's Balboa Port,
where workers had built barricades during their strike that began
March 13. The port is at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal,
which continues to operate normally.

   A rain storm whipped through
central Argentina, killing at least 21 people and forcing 59,000 to
leave their homes, civil defense officials said today.
   At least 11 children drowned as floodwaters in some low-lying
areas near Buenos Aires reached up to six feet. Several other
people were electrocuted while crossing flooded streets where live
electrical wires had fallen, authorities said.
   Authorities said the storm, which lasted for four days, ended
today.
   Among the hardest hit areas were Quilmes, Avellaneda and Lomas
de Zamora south of Buenos Aires. Horse-drawn carts, makeshift rafts
and boats were used to evacuate residents. Some people took refuge
on the roofs of their homes, officials said.
   Evacuees were taken to emergency shelters in churches, schools,
sports clubs and office buildings. Health authorities have warned
of a possible outbreak of hepatitis following the storm.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer says the unprecedented
authority given him by the Legislature to repair the state's
finances will be tempered by compassion and his awareness that
lawmakers are looking over his shoulder.
   Budget officials worked through the weekend to come up with a
list of proposed cuts to present to Roemer today after the
Legislature wound up a special session by approving the emergency
bills. The governor was expected to sign the package today.
   The budgetary authority is aimed at meeting a fiscal crisis
which threatens to bankrupt the state.
   In addition to giving Roemer power to cut entire state programs
and close institutions through June 30, the end of the fiscal year,
lawmakers granted the administration the right to raise fees for
state services without public hearings or legislative oversight.
   After lawmakers finished work Saturday, Roemer said the
temporary budget authority will be tempered ``by my compassion and
good sense that they (legislators) will be coming back in three and
a half weeks to look over my shoulder.''
   The governor said he was aiming for $50 million in spending cuts
for the remaining quarter of the fiscal year and $22 million in fee
increases.
   The rest of the $200 million deficit expected this fiscal year
will be met by issuing short-term bonds or delaying payments for
services rendered to the state, Roemer said. He also said layoffs
of an undetermined number of state employees would be needed.
   Over a full year, the spending cuts would total about $200
million if the Legislature did not change them during its regular
session beginning in April, while the fee hikes would bring in
about $88 million, he said.
   ``Those are the targets. I don't know if I will be able to reach
either,'' he said.
   Commissioner of Administration Brian Kendrick said budget
officials worked through the weekend to come up with the list of
proposed cuts.
   Kendrick also said work would begin on the new Louisiana
Recovery Corp., created by the Legislature to govern a statewide
taxing district that could impose up to a 1 percent sales tax. The
tax would finance the issuance of bonds that would pay off the
state's $1.3 billion long-term debt.
   The administration-dominated commission cannot issue bonds or
impose the levy until the Legislature drops the same amount from
the current 4-cent state sales tax.
   The administration will ask the Louisiana Supreme Court to rule
on the consitutionality of the commission. If it does not pass
legal muster, the state will use short-term bonds to finance the
debt, Kendrick said.
   ``Those are the only two ways out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Won't Hear NY Political Boss' Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by former New York City political boss Meade Esposito, who
sought to prevent public disclosure of certain court documents.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling challenged by
Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic boss convicted of giving
illegal gratuities to Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y.
   Esposito sought to conceal information contained in pretrial
requests he and Biaggi made to suppress wiretap evidence obtained
by federal law enforcement officials.
   The New York Times, the New York Daily News and The Associated
Press asked that the information be made public.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the news
organizations in January.
   The appeals court said revealing the information, with some
deletions made by a federal judge, would not violate Esposito's
privacy rights.
   Esposito was convicted last Sept. 22 of giving, and Biaggi of
accepting, illegally gratuities in the form of free vacations.
   In a separate prosecution, Biaggi is on trial in New York City
with six others accused of turning the Wedtech Corporation into a
racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to
get government contracts.
   In the appeal acted on today, Esposito said allowing public
disclosure of the documents from the Biaggi-Esposito case would
have an unconstitutional chilling effect on all defendants.
   It could prevent defendants from making pretrial motions to
suppress evidence for fear that information contained in the
motions would be made public, Esposito said.
   The case is Esposito vs. New York Times, 87-1319.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Lawsuit Against Trivial Pursuit Creators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
$300 million copyright-infringement lawsuit against the creators
and marketers of Trivial Pursuit, a popular board game.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the author of
several encyclopedias on trivia that many of the questions
contained in the board game infringed on his copyright works.
   Trivial Pursuit, a game utilizing question-and-answer cards, was
conceived in 1979 by Chris Haney and Scott Abbot, who along with
John Haney developed the concept.
   In 1981, the three joined with Ed Werner in forming a Canadian
corporation, Horn Abbott Ltd., to market the game. Abbot and Chris
Haney assigned their rights to the corporation, and Horn Abbot Lt.
obtained a Canadian copyright in the game.
   In late 1982, Horn Abbot contracted with Selchow & Righter Co.
to distribute the game in the United States, and by the end of 1984
sales had reached $256 million.
   Fred Worth, a California resident who had authored two volumes
of ``The Complete Unabridged Super Trivia Encyclopedia,'' sued the
two corporations and the four Canadians behind Horn Abbot in late
1984.
   His lawsuit alleged that the Genus, Silver Screen and Baby
Boomer editions of Trivial Pursuit _ each containing 6,000
questions and answers _ were guilty of copyright infringement.
   For example, Worth contended that 1,675 of the Genus edition's
6,000 questions were taken from his first encyclopedia volume.
   The Trivial Pursuit creators did not deny consulting Worth's
books in developing the board game, but they said his books were
among numerous reference sources used.
   A federal trial judge in Los Angeles, upheld by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last September, threw out the suit.
   The appeals court ruled that there was no ``substantial
similarity'' between Worth's books and the Trivial Pursuit
question-and-answer cards.
   The case is Worth vs. Selchow & Righter Co., 87-1268.

<TEXT>
   Floodwaters burst through dikes on the
Danube River and the Rhine River was rising fast today as hundred
of people were evacuated from their homes.
   Emergency workers were working to strengthen the earthen dikes
along the Danube. The Rhine was rising about an inch an hour in
some locations today, threatening homes and businesses in Cologne,
Bonn and other communities.
   Major rivers across West Germany have been flooding for about
two weeks but heavy rains over the weekend worsened the situation.
   The rising Rhine forced authorites to close parts of a highway
between Mainz and Koblenz and disrupted trains in the area.
   Officials said about 1,400 people were evacuated Sunday night
and early today after the Danube burst through several dikes near
Regensburg, about 45 miles north of Munich.
   Hundreds of cows, pigs and other farm animals were also taken to
higher ground to escape rising waters, authorities added.
   Hans Voggenreiter, spokesman for the rescue operation, said it
was the worst flooding in the area since 1920.
   ``People were evacuated with rowboats and powerboats,'' said
Voggenreiter. ``Most of them were taken in by relatives and
friends. The rest are being cared for in schools and public
auditoriums.''
   Floodwaters had also entered parts of Regensburg itself, as well
as sections of Passau, 80 miles to the east.
   Officials said flooding along the Neckar and Mosel rivers was
receding, but the Rhine continued to climb.
   Riverside sidewalks and some streets in Bonn, the federal
capital, had disappeared beneath the water.
   Residents of large villas that line the Rhine in the Bonn
district of Bad Godesberg, home to many embassies and ambassadors'
residents, were using pumps to dry out their flooded cellars.
   ``Groundwater is coming through (cellar) seams all over the
city,'' said an emergency official who asked not to be identified.
``But we're keeping our cool.''

   Community leaders appealed for calm after
the slaying of an activist who had sought to become the first
Indian judge in racially tense Robeson County, but two other
candidates reported receiving death threats.
   Julian Pierce, 42, was killed in his home early Saturday by
three shotgun blasts fired at point-blank range, in what
authorities called the first assassination of a candidate for
political office in the state. No arrests have been made.
   Since the killing, Pierce's opponent in the judgeship race and a
friend of Pierce running for office in Forsyth County have reported
receiving death threats, The Charlotte Observer said today.
   The Rev. Joy Johnson of the First Baptist Church said Sunday he
hoped the crime could be solved ``before the heat rises and before
there is a war.''
   ``We've had a calm night and day, but it will take at least a
few more days until the tension is out of the air,'' said Johnson,
who along with other community leaders appealed to residents on
Sunday to avoid violence. ``Anything could spark something. I hope
that doesn't happen.''
   Pierce, a lawyer, was running for a Superior Court judgeship in
Robeson County, where few Indians hold office or work in law
enforcement, despite a population that is 37 percent Indian.
   He was alone Saturday morning in his brick ranch house, which is
flanked by farmland and another small house, authorities said.
   ``The best we can establish, he got home shortly after midnight,
he undressed and went to bed,'' said Robeson County Sheriff Hubert
Stone. ``Then someone came to the back door, knocking. Pierce
slipped on a pair of jeans and went to the door. When he got to the
door, the person either shot through the window or stuck the gun
through the window and shot Pierce in the chest.
   ``As Pierce turned, he was then shot in the lower left side.
Pierce fell to the floor,'' the sheriff said.
   ``It just looked like he was actually assassinated,'' he said.
   Earl Moore, who said he had known Pierce for 15 years, said the
candidate ``knew that something could happen'' to him. Moore said
he knew of a threat against Pierce, but said he would talk only to
federal officials in Washington, not to county, state or federal
officials in North Carolina.
   Jim Hatcher, a friend of Pierce who is running for a seat on the
Board of County Commissioners in Forsyth County, across the state
around Winston-Salem, told the Observer that he received an
anonymous telephone call late Sunday in which someone said ``get
out of town.''
   ``I plan to talk to Gov. Martin,'' he said. ``The people are
wanting to talk, but they're scared. Either Martin's going to do
something, or else.''
   Hatcher is the uncle of Eddie Hatcher, who, with Timothy Jacobs,
took over The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1 to
protest alleged government corruption in Robeson County.
   Lumberton police said they began guarding District Attorney Joe
Freeman Britt's home Sunday after he reported receiving threats.
Britt, who was running against Pierce, and his family were in
seclusion under police protection.
   Pierce grew up in neighboring Hoke County and worked in a
Virginia shipyard after graduating from college. He returned to
North Carolina and attended North Carolina Central University law
school, then worked for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
from 1976 to 1978.
   He moved to Robeson County to serve as the first director of
Lumbee River Legal Services, representing those too poor to afford
lawyers and practicing public interest law.
   ``He was an easygoing guy. He never had no problem with anyone
that I heard tell of. People liked him,'' Stone said.
   Pierce's supporters said they might try to field another
candidate in the upcoming primary.
   ``The question is whether or not that will be allowed, under the
general statutes,'' said Sam Kerns of Pembroke. ``We'll be meeting
again ... but I really don't think that it may be possible,
according to the law.''
   Pierce's campaign manager, Harvey Goodwin, said supporters are
considering a request for a special session of the state
Legislature to consider postponing the judicial race.
   Britt, a white, has been district attorney in the county for 14
years. But Pierce was considered the leader in the race because of
a controversial vote by Indians earlier this month to consolidate
the county's five school systems, which are divided largely along
racial lines.
   The election was to be decided May 3, the date of the Democratic
primary, since no Republicans were in the race.
   The judgeship Pierce had sought was created to help ensure that
minorities would have an opportunity to elect a judge. The
Legislature gave the county its own judicial district, separating
it from adjoining Scotland County.
   Indian leaders met Sunday but would not allow reporters to
attend. A meeting Saturday resulted in a request to state officials
to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce's death.
   Robeson County, which borders on South Carolina, is also 37
percent white and 26 percent black. It is one of the state's
poorest counties, and has long been torn by racial animosity.
   Activism, particularly by Lumbees, has thrived since November
1986, when a sheriff's deputy fatally shot an unarmed Lumbee.
   Anger at what the Indians call corrupt local government and
entrenched racism boiled over Feb. 1, in the hostage-taking at The
Robesonian newspaper.
   Pierce's killing ``makes me think there's no hope for the
Indians,'' said one Lumbee, Janice Locklear. ``I'm so mad I could
fight.''

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Botswana's official statement and details of
statements by South African military. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African army today raided a
house on the outskirts of the capital, killing four residents who
were burned beyond recognition after an hour-long gunbattle.
   South Africa, which claims that neighboring Botswana harbors
guerrillas hostile to Pretoria, called the victims terrorists. It
said it was responsible for the attack in a statement issued by its
Defense Force in Pretoria.
   The office of President Quett Masire of Botswana said four
people died _ a South African man, two Batswana women, and a third
unidentified woman. The Botswana Press Association quoted Deputy
Police Commissioner Norman Moleboge as saying residents reported
all the occupants of the house were Batswana.
   The president's statement said all were sleeping when the South
Africans attacked in the township of Phiring, known locally as
Tsholofelo. The community lies two miles from the center of the
capital of Gaborone, a border city.
   ``The office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly
attack and murder of innocent people in Botswana by the South
African army,'' said Botswana's statement. ``The office of the
president once again reiterates Botswana's belief that South
Africa's problems cannot be resolved by attacking neighboring
countries such as Botswana and strongly urges the South African
government to engage in meaningful negotiations with the genuine
leadership of the oppressed majority in that country.''
   South Africa's government and economy are controlled by 5
million whites. The country's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs under a system of racial segregation known as
apartheid.
   Pretoria has issued several threats against Botswana in recent
months, accusing it of harboring African National Congress
guerrillas bent on ending white domination in South Africa.
   The Botswana government says it supports the group's goals and
allows its representatives in the country. But Botswana says it
does not let the group launch attacks into South Africa from
Botswana.
   The South African military statement said today's raid was a
follow-up to a shootout near the South Africa-Botswana border
Friday. In that attack, the military said soldiers killed three
suspected terrorists in a running battle near a farm and captured
rifles, machine pistols and hand grenades.
   The operation had not previously been reported.
   In today's shootout, neighbors said they heard sporadic
automatic gunfire, and possibly grenades, for an hour. Two
witnesses reported that the attackers left in a helicopter.
   Moleboge was quoted as saying four people were shot, then set
afire by the attackers, and that gasoline containers were found at
the scene. The Botswana Press Association said it was believed an
explosion may have been caused by a gas cylinder in the house,
which was destroyed.
   The South Africans gave no details on how the occupants of the
house died.

<HEAD>Gadhafi to Withdraw Troops from Border with Egypt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said today he is
withdrawing Libyan troops from the Egyptian border and promised
Libya would not use force to undermine the Egyptian state.
   If carried out, the Libyan leader's decision would represent an
unprecedented conciliatory move. Gadhafi began feuding with Egypt
about 15 years ago.
   Gadhafi's announcement followed a series of smaller-scale
reciprocal goodwill gestures between the two countries in recent
weeks.
   Gadhafi made the announcement in a speech at a former British
base at the Mediterranean city of Tobruk near the Egyptian border.
The speech, broadcast live by Libyan television and monitored in
London, was delivered at a ceremony marking the 18th anniversary of
Britain's evacuation of military bases in Libya.
   In another departure from long-standing hostile policy toward
Cairo, Gadhafi said Libya would not use force to overthrow
President Hosni Mubarak's government or get it to renounce its 1979
peace treaty with Israel. The treaty was among numerous sore spots
in Egyptian-Libyan friction.
   The speech contained one anti-Egyptian barb, however, with
Gadhafi charging that Egypt ``abandoned'' the Arab world when it
signed the American-mediated Camp David agreements with Israel.
   ``I hereby declare the withdrawal of all military troops from
along the Libyan-Egyptian artificial borders,'' Gadhafi said.
   ``I want to emphasize to the Egyptian people and army that the
Libyan eastern military zone (along the border) will finally be
abolished.''
   Gadhafi did not say how many troops Libya has along the border.
Neither did he specify a time frame for the pullback.
   The Egyptian-Libyan feud began in 1972 when Cairo rejected
Gadhafi's bid for immediate merger of the two countries.
   Egypt blamed Gadhafi for a series of bombings in Cairo and other
cities in 1975 and 1976, and the two countries fought a five-day
border war in July 1977. The political tension deepened when Egypt
since the peace treaty with Israel and moved closer to the United
States.
   Gadhafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in a military coup in
1969, offered to let Egypt verify the troop withdrawal.
   ``If Egypt wants to ascertain this, it will be able to observe,
and we accept any verification commission or any observer or
monitor who would be satisfied that this region is completely
evacuated by military forces,'' he said.
   The Libyan leader said his forces will be withdrawn ``without us
asking for anything in return from the Egyptian side.''

   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the
appeal of a convicted killer who said his rights were violated when
he was denied an opportunity to talk to his lawyer during a trial
recess.
   The court said it will review a ruling that denied a new trial
to the South Carolina man.
   The defendant, Donald Ray Perry, was convicted of murder,
kidnapping and criminal sexual assault in the killing of Mary
Heimberger, whose body was found on March 7, 1981, in a wooded area
in Richland County, S.C. He was sentenced to life in prison.
   Perry confessed to police that he had shot the victim, but said
it was an accident.
   Ms. Heimberger had been raped, shot in both kneecaps and fatally
shot in the chest.
   During a 15-minute trial recess while Perry was testifying, his
lawyer sought to speak to him to advise him about his rights on
cross-examination. But the judge refused to allow them to talk.
   Perry filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled
that his rights were violated. The judge said denying Perry the
right to talk to his laywer during a recess, no matter how brief,
is grounds for throwing out the conviction.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the
conviction in November.
   ``Not every limitation of the relationship between a defendant
and his attorney violates the defendant's right to counsel,'' the
appeals court said.
   The appeals court said barring a defendant from meeting with his
lawyer during a brief trial recess is not automatic grounds for
declaring a new trial. There must be evidence that the denial
prejudiced the case against the defendant, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court relied in part on two Supreme Court rulings in
1984 that reinstated criminal convictions of two defendants who
said they were denied effective legal assistance at their trials.
   The high court said a claim of ineffective representation must
be examined in the context of whether the trial produced a just
result.
   The appeals court said that standard also should apply to
Perry's claim.
   ``It would make little sense to maintain a per se (automatic)
rule of reversal for a brief restriction on consultation, but to
inquire into prejudice if Perry had been represented incompetently
throughout,'' the appeals court said.
   ``To reverse automatically a conviction because of an absence of
consultation during one brief, fortuitous recess in a trial which
spanned nearly two weeks would be to confer a benefit upon a
criminal defendant who may not deserve it,'' the appeals court
added.
   It also said, ``The evidence against Perry was overwhelming,''
and there was no indication that denying him the chance to confer
with his lawyer prior to cross-examination altered his testimony
significantly.
   ``It would be wrong to exalt technical perfection at the expense
of our society's legitimate and weighty interest in punishing
offenders,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Perry vs. Leeke, 87-6325,

   A general strike today slowed transportation and
closed most factories in the largest city in a region that
Armenians want to unite with their republic, a witness said.
   The director of the only hotel in Stepanakert said all but
essential services were shut down today because of a strike.
   ``The bread factory and the milk factory are working. The others
are not working. Everyone is sitting at home,'' the director of the
Karabakh Hotel said in a telephone interview. He said he was an
ethnic Armenian but refused to give his name.
   About 30 percent of Stepanakert's public transport was shut
down, he said. Communist Party representatives in the city called
workers to meetings at factories today and urged them to return to
work Tuesday, he said.
   Stepanakert is the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly
Armenian region in the republic of Azerbaijan which activists are
seeking to unite with Armenia. At least 32 people have died in
ethnic violence between Armenians and Azeris since protests began
in February.
   Armenian activists have said a general strike began Wednesday in
parts of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported today the strikes
and unrest in Azerbaijan have disrupted the economy and cost the
region millions of dollars in lost revenues.
   The Communist Party daily said action by Armenianis has
``aggravated the economic situation not only in the autonomous
region but also, partly, in the entire republic.''
   
   Pravda said the auto and trucking industries alone lost about
$6.5 million in January and February. The railway industry lost
about $360,000.
   The article gave little indication about how the money was lost
but quoted a railway official in Azerbaijan as saying freight cars
had not been unloaded.
   The official, Garik Sarkisyan, was quoted by Pravda as saying
the situation was ``bad'' and ``loss of time and money has become
the usual thing.''
   Pravda said Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian republic, was
``relatively calm'' with no incidents over the weekend ``connected
with national relations.''
   Moscow dissidents, in telephone contact during the weekend with
Armenian sources, described Yerevan as ``a dead city,'' with people
staying off the streets to protest a government crackdown on public
demonstrations.
   The official press acknowledged that most businesses were closed
in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, over the
weekend, but gave no information on the situation this morning.
   According to various reports from dissident and official sources
over the weekend, the general strike appeared to have taken place
in Stepanakert, but in other areas most businesses were open.
   An administrator of the Yerevan Hotel, who spoke on condition of
anonymnity, said the city's businesses were open today. Other calls
to Yerevan did not go through.
   Western reporters have been barred from the region, and
telephone service has been largely cut off.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, including Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other members of the top leadership,
called last week for improvement of social and economic conditions
in the contested area, but it did not deal directly with the
annexation issue.
   Activists interpreted that as a rejection of their demands and
called for a general strike.
   Tass said today the Communist Party Central Committee and
government's Council of Ministers approved plans for construction
of more schools _ including Armenian schools _ in Nagorno-Karabakh
and other regions of Azerbaijain where ethnic Armenians live.

   A prostitute who says she posed naked for
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart will show those poses in the July issue
of Penthouse magazine, a spokeswoman for the publication said today.
   ``From what I understand, the photographs will recreate the
precise poses and actions that Jimmy Swaggart paid for during the
long affair,'' said Leslie Jay, vice president and director of
public relations for the magazine.
   ``I also understand that the interview will review every episode
in the relationship that ruined this most powerful TV preacher in
the world,'' she said in a telephone interview from her New York
office.
   Jay said she had not seen the interview or the pictures.
   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21 after tearfully
confessing to an unspecified sin against his wife, family and
church.
   Church leaders have said he was photographed with a reputed
prostitute outside a seedy New Orleans motel. Debra Murphree says
she is the woman in those photographs.
   Jay said she did not know how much Murphree was paid or about
the editorial deliberations behind Penthouse's decision to use the
photographs and interview.
   The National Enquirer decided last month not to use an interview
with Murphree after she failed a lie detector test. She told New
Orleans television station WVUE she failed the test because she had
taken drugs the day before.
   Paul Levy, the Enquirer's senior editor, said Murphree's
companion, John Martinez, 28, offered her story to the Enquirer for
$100,000. Martinez has said he also tried to peddle the story to
People magazine and ABC-TV's Nightline.
   Murphree, also known as Debra Arleen Hedge, has three children
living with her parents in Indiana and an arrest record in Florida,
Tennessee and Louisiana, mainly involving prostitution charges.

<HEAD>Donald Trump Buys Plaza; Wants To Win Fifth Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate magnate Donald Trump, the new owner
of the Plaza hotel, says he plans to make the Fifth Avenue landmark
even posher in an effort to make it the second five-star hotel in
Manhattan.
   He vowed that the Plaza, already the city's most famous hotel,
would become the most luxurious hotel in the world under the
supervision of his wife, Ivana. The hotel is a four-star
establishment.
   The only Manhattan hotel with the distinction of having five
stars is the Carlyle Hotel, at Madison Avenue and 76th Street.
   Built in 1907 in the style of a French chateau, the Plaza has
been cited by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission as a
``superb example of the elegance and opulence that characterized
the period just before World War I.''
   The hotel, with its famed public spaces and its commanding site
overlooking Central Park, has become one of New York's most
recognizable buildings through its frequent movie appearances,
including a starring role in ``Plaza Suite.'' More recently, the
Plaza provided an upscale encampment for ``Crocodile Dundee.''
   But it has lost some of its luster under a succession of owners
in recent years and is in the midst of a major renovation.
   Its latest owners were Texas financier Robert Bass and the
Japanese-based Aoki Corp., which bought it last October from Westin
Hotels.
   Trump, when he announced announced Saturday that he had
purchased the Plaza Hotel for $390 million, said he would not
change its name. ``It's got the most important name in the world,
and it's going to remain that way,'' he said.
   Trump lives just two blocks from the Plaza at his Trump Tower
high-rise apartment building. He won out in a bidding contest
against two other Manhattan developers, Philip Pilevsky and Arthur
Cohen, who wanted to convert part of the hotel into cooperative
apartments.
   Room rates at the Plaza start at $195 a night. Trump said he
hoped to lure some year-round guests to the hotel at rental rates
of $400,000 to $500,000 a year.

<TEXT>
   A 24-hour general strike today shut
factories, airports and banks across Portugal as hundreds of
thousands of workers staged the biggest industrial action in the
country's history to protest government labor reforms.
   The Communist and Socialist labor federations, united for the
first time, claimed the strike was a victory for the unions over
the center-right government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.
   Cavaco Silva, whose Social Democrats hold a solid parliamentary
majority, said the strike would not cause him to alter a single
line of a government bill that would make it easier for businesses
to fire workers. He said the legislation is crucial to attracting
investment in Portugal and modernizing the economy.
   Labor leaders said 85 percent of union members supported the
strike.
   ``The government cannot act as if were deaf, dumb and blind in
the face of this massive protest,'' said Manuel Carvalho da Silva,
a leader of the Communist-dominated General Confederation of
Portuguese Workers.
   But the government said in a statement ``the country is working
normally apart from the transport sector where there have been some
clear cases of sabotage.'' The Labor Ministry said unions were
exaggerating the extent of support for the strike.
   Twenty-two in-coming flights and 29 departures were cancelled at
Lisbon Airport and many other international flights were diverted,
officials said.
   Most flights of the state-owned airline TAP-Air Portugal were
cancelled at Oporto Airport in the north and Faro in the south.
   State-owned public transport companies were hit hardest by the
strike. Train services were paralyzed across the country. Bus,
trams, subway and ferry services were reduced to skeleton services
required under strike law.
   Police said two shots were fired at a private bus in the
northern city of Porto. No one was injured. Traffic was not heavily
congested in most cities as many workers stayed home, police said.
   The government says existing labor legislation, passed in the
wake of a leftist military coup that returned Portugal to democracy
in 1975, is so protective that it is almost impossible for
companies to dismiss workers.
   Cavaco Silva says this deters investors and is prejudicial to
workers because it encourages companies to hire them on short-term
contracts, use child labor and keep wages low.
   The government says the new legislation will still provide
greater protection than workers enjoy in any other West European
country or the United States.
   Unions and the leading Socialist opposition party say the
legislation will give managers the power to fire workers ``whenever
and `whyever' they like.''

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Dispute Pitting Easter Seal Against Playboy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 15-21, In another copyright, with other cases.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away an unusual
copyright dispute that pitted the Easter Seal Society against
Playboy Enterprises.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that
Playboy illegally used materials intended for an Easter Seal
telethon in a pornographic movie.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   New Orleans musician and entertainer Ronnie Kole, acting on
behalf of the Easter Seal Society, contracted with public
television station WYES in 1982 to make a videotape of a staged
Mardi Gras-style parade and Dixieland jam session.
   The videotape was edited into a 16-minute version for the
society's national telethon for crippled children, and was
broadcast March 28, 1982.
   A year later, WYES broadcasting director Julius Cain received a
telephone call from John Thompson, a Canadian television producer
who requested videotape of a Mardi Gras parade.
   Cain, unaware of Thompson's exact intentions, provided an
unedited copy of the Easter Seal tape. Portions of the tape were
incorporated into a movie entitled ``Candy, The Stripper,'' a
sexually explicit film carried on cable television's Playboy
Channel.
   Some viewers in the New Orleans area who had taken part in the
staged Mardis Gras parade, upon seeing themselves in the
pornographic movie, complained that their privacy rights were
invaded.
   The Easter Seal Society then sued Playboy Enterprises, WYES, a
Canadian film producer and others _ accusing them of copyright
violations.
   The society said it, and not WYES, owns the copyright on the
videotape.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the society
last April. The appeals court said Congress in 1976 narrowed the
copyright protection for those who hire others to produce original
works.
   Because WYES was an independent contractor, the Easter Seal
Society was not the sole ``author'' of the Mardi Gras videotape,
the appeals court said.
   ``WYES did not simply set up one camera on a tripod, turn it on
and sit down to watch'' the staged parade and Dixieland
performance, the appeals court continued. ``Instead, it worked
cooperatively and dynamically with the performers to create the
tape.''
   Reagan administration lawyers, asked by the high court last
November for their views, said the 5th Circuit court's
interpretation of copyright law's work-made-for-hire provisions
differs from those of other appeals courts. But they said ``the
present case is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving the
conflict in the circuits.''
   In another copyright case, the court refused to revive a $300
million copyright-infringement lawsuit against the creators and
marketers of Trivial Pursuit, a popular board game.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the author of
several encyclopedias on trivia that many of the questions
contained in the board game infringed on his copyright works.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to hear the appeal of a convicted killer who said his
rights were violated when he was denied an opportunity to talk to
his lawyer during a trial recess.
   The court said it will review a ruling that denied a new trial
to the South Carolina man.
   _ Refused to hear an appeal by former New York City political
boss Meade Esposito, who sought to prevent public disclosure of
certain court documents.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling challenged by
Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic boss convicted of giving
illegal gratuities to Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y.
   The copyright dispute case is Easter Seal Society vs. Playboy
Enterprises, 87-482.

   Baby M is happy and secure with her
father and his wife and shows no more attachment to the surrogate
mother who refused to surrender her than she does to her
babysitter, the toddler's father testified today.
   William Stern, testifying at a court hearing over visitation
rights for surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, said he
believes his daughter should not be allowed to see Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould for several years.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who agreed to bear the child under a
$10,000 contract with Stern, currently is allowed to see the child
once a week for two hours under supervision.
   The visitation fight is the final legal phase of the court
battle involving Baby M, now Melissa Stern, who turned 2 Sunday.
The court hearing was ordered in a landmark ruling by the New
Jersey Supreme Court overturning surrogacy for pay.
   Both sides in the dispute strongly disagree over what would be
in the best interest of the girl, with the key issue centering on
whether continued contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would be
harmful or healthy.
   The child, conceived by artificial insemination using Stern's
sperm, lives with Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, in their Tenafly
home.
   Stern likened Melissa to a young sapling that has to put down
its roots.
   ``If anything is done to interrupt her putting down those roots,
I'm afraid Melissa does not have much of a future,'' he said during
a half-hour of testimony.
   Melissa calls him ``Dada,'' and his wife, ``Mama,'' he noted.
   Stern acknowledged under cross-examination by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, that Melissa appeared to
be suffering no ill effects from her visits with Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, and he said he would be willing to try to work out
a visitation arrangement if the court ordered one.
   ``The critical thing is that these adults can get on with their
lives, put the conflicts of the past behind them and support one
another,'' said Dr. David Brodzinsky, who acted as a
court-appointed psychologist in the widely publicized 1986 trial
that marked the first court ruling on a surrogacy contract.
   The judge in that trial barred Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from seeing
Melissa, but on Feb. 3 the state Supreme Court declared surrogacy
for pay illegal and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parental
rights, while granting custody to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court, in ordering today's visitation hearing, made
no specific recommendations on visitation and gave the lower court
the ``broadest powers'' to resolve the issue.
   Mental health experts who have examined Melissa say she appears
to be unaffected by the legal storm around her. She was described
as friendly with adults, while being more attached to Stern than to
her mother.
   In court papers filed last week, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she
wants liberal, unsupervised visitation. The Sterns are seeking a
halt to visitation for several years.
   The session before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween is
expected to last about three days. The high court ruled that the
issue of visitation must be resolved by early May.
   In court papers, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she wants visitation
immediately expanded to eight hours twice a week, unsupervised at
her home in East Brunswick. She says she wants the visits
eventually to include half the summer and some holidays.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' according to papers filed by her
attorney, Harold Cassidy.
   But the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff, argues in court papers
that no contact would be better for the child because Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould does not offer a healthy environment for her,
particularly in the last year since the mother became pregnant out
of wedlock, divorced her former husband and married Wall Street
accountant Dean Gould.
   Skoloff did not spell out in the court papers how long contact
should be discontinued. In an interview, he said ``as long as
possible,'' and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys say the Sterns are
seeking a six-year moratorium on visits.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys see her divorce and remarriage
in a positive light, arguing that she has a more stable
relationship and financially secure lifestyle.

   A Northwest Airlines jet was evacuated when fuel
vapors briefly ignited, sparking what passengers thought was a fire
and closing the airport for 20 minutes, authorities said. Four
people were slightly injured.
   Flight 288, originating in San Diego with 144 passengers and
seven crew members aboard, landed safely at 8:20 p.m. Sunday at
Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, about 20 miles west of Detroit.
   As the Boeing 727 waited for clearance to taxi to its gate,
residual fuel in the exhaust system of the auxiliary power unit
sparked a ``flash'' on the plane's right wing, Northwest spokesman
William Wren said.
   It was immediately extinguished without damage to the plane,
Wren said.
   The flash was seen by a controller in the airport tower,
passengers aboard Flight 288 and by people aboard another plane
taxiing behind it, said Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Chicago.
   ``I saw a flash and I looked down and I felt heat on my face,
and I looked out and there's a big flame on my window and all I
could see was red,'' Northwest passenger Mike Soderling of San
Diego told radio station WCXI.
   ``This lady next to me was screaming `Fire, fire,''' Soderling
said. ``My first reaction was to get my luggage, but then I threw
it down and ran to the door.''
   The pilot triggered an automatic device that extinguished the
flash, but by that time, the plane had been evacuated and airport
firefighters were summoned, Edelstein said.
   An initial FAA examination of the plane revealed no burned parts
or other signs of an actual fire, he said. Northwest officials
stressed that no fire had occurred.
   Three of the injured passengers suffered minor cuts and bruises
while sliding down evacuation chutes, Annapolis Hospital nursing
supervisor Mary Smith said. None was admitted. The fourth
passenger, a 64-year-old woman, was in good condition today at
William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, suffering from trauma and
knee and elbow injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Carol Jonson.
   The auxiliary power unit runs the aircraft's electrical, air
conditioning and other systems while it is on the ground and
operates separately from the engines, Wren said.
   Edelstein said the plane will remain grounded while FAA
investigators examine it further.

<HEAD>City Parceling Out More Than $9 Million in Back Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Chicago has agreed to pay more
than $9 million in back-pay awards to settle a discrimination case
involving 729 women, blacks and Hispanics on the Chicago police
force, the Justice Department announced today.
   The proposed consent decree, filed in U.S. District Court in
Chicago, would require the city to establish an interest-bearing
back-pay fund of $9.2 million for reimbursements of awards to
discrimination victims. The city also would adjust seniority dates
for those victims.
   The decree would resolve an employment-discrimination suit filed
in 1973 alleging a pattern and practice of discrimination by
Chicago in police department hiring and promotion. A federal judge
in January 1976 found the city in violation of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   The consent decree covers:
   _233 women on the 1972 policewoman eligibility list who were
subsequently hired or reclassified as police officers and who
successfully completed their probationary period; and women who
were employed before March 24, 1972, as policewomen or matrons and
subsequently were reclassified as police officers.
   _455 black and Hispanic men who applied for the 1968 or 1971
patrolman eligibility lists and were hired from March 24, 1972, to
Dec. 31, 1978, as patrolmen or police officers from those lists,
and who successfully completed their probationary period.
   _The first three women promoted to sergeant after March 24,
1972, who served as policewomen or matrons in 1968 or before that
time.
   _The first 38 black and Hispanic men who applied for promotion
to sergeant in 1968 and who were promoted to that rank from March
24, 1972, to Dec, 31, 1973.
   The proposed decree was filed in court Friday.

gunshot wound to the lower back, hospital spokesmen said.
   The shooting took place at 9 a.m. Sunday outside Samaritan
Church of God in Christ, police said.
   Van passengers told police a man with a gun stopped the van
during its pick-up route and told them he was looking for his
16-year-old adopted daughter, Carmel Shirley, who had left home a
few weeks ago.
   When the van arrived at the church, the same gunman was waiting.
   ``He was just hollering `I want my baby,''' said Earnestine
Shirley, 33, who is Carmel's mother and Bridgett's aunt. ``He was
talking about killing up the whole family.''
   The crowd of about 15 to 20 scattered as the man started
shooting, witnesses said.
   One bullet pierced Earnestine Shirley's elbow and another struck
Bridgett. The gunman fired several times at Laura Shirley,
Bridgett's mother, but never wounded her.
   Carmel Shirley had planned to arrive at the church later and
wasn't with the other members of her family.
   Earnestine Shirley was treated for the elbow wound and released
from hospital. Laura Shirley was treated for knee scrapes and
released.
   According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Earnestine Shirley
said she became pregnant at 14 and six years later asked an older
couple to temporarily take care of her child. Later she learned the
couple adopted the girl, she said.
   But three weeks ago, she said Carmel, now 16, returned to her
alleging that Thomas, her adoptive father, had mistreated her since
she was 8.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Disqualify Bankruptcy Judge in Georgia Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to disqualify
a bankruptcy judge from presiding over a Georgia case in which he
ordered the winning side to ghostwrite opinions he then signed.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
judge's actions, while ill-advised, did not violate the losing
side's rights.
   The case involves bankruptcy proceedings begun in 1975 in which
Colony Square Co., a developer, was ordered to surrender ownership
of a $200 million real estate development in Atlanta to the
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   The insurance company was the developer's chief creditor.
   Bankruptcy Court Judge Hugh Robinson, after a hearing in the
dispute on June 22, 1984, telephoned Prudential lawyer Francis M.
Bird Jr. later that day and told him he intended to rule in favor
of the insurance firm.
   Robinson outlined what he intended to say in his ruling and
asked Bird to prepare the order.
   After some minor typographical corrections, the judge signed the
order drafted by Bird.
   Lawyers for Colony Square were not told of the conversation
between Robinson and Bird, or that the judge's order was written by
Prudential's attorney.
   Robinson's orders were ghostwritten on two subsequent occasions
when he denied a requem and thereby leads to stronger,
sounder judicial rulings.''
   But the appeals court said Colony Square's due-process rights
were not violated because Robinson already had decided the case
before asking for Bird's help, and because Colony Square had ample
opportunity to argue its side before Robinson and before the
federal judge that reviewed the case.
   Robinson's ``actions in preparing these orders have little to
recommend them,'' the appeals court said. But the process ``did not
prejudice (Colony Square) and was not fundamentally unfair.''
   The Supreme Court is reviewing a related issue in a Louisiana
dispute over ownership of a hospital corporation. In that case, the
justices have agreed to decide whether federal judges may be
disqualified from presiding in cases when they are unaware they
have a connection to the case that presents a possible conflict of
interest. A decision is expected by July.
   The case acted on today is Colony Square vs. Prudential
Insurance Co., 87-1299.

<HEAD>Israeli Government Reaches Agreement with Walsh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh has reached
agreement with Israel after year-long negotiations for its
cooperation in his investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, both
sides announced today.
   Under the accord, Israel has given Walsh the historical and
financial chronologies covering its role in the shipment of U.S.
weapons to Iran in 1985 and 1986, said an Israeli official.
   ``He (Walsh) will get what he wants without us having to give up
what we wanted,'' said the official, speaking on condition he not
be named.
   Israel had sought immunity from prosecution for the four key
Israeli players in the arms sales, profits from which were diverted
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Two former White House aides and two U.S. businessmen have been
indicted in the United States for conspiracy to defraud the
government in the funds' diversion.
   Israel also gave Walsh written answers to questions posed by the
congressional investigators who received the Israeli chronologies
last summer, said the official.
   ``The government of the state of Israel and the office of the
Independent Counsel have signed an agreement covering the
cooperation of the government of Israel in the Iran-Contra
investigation,'' Walsh's office said in a prepared statement.
   Walsh's spokesman, Jim Wieghart, and Israeli Embassy spokesman
Yossi Gal said the terms of the agreement are confidential.
   Israel had turned over the chronologies to the congressional
Iran-Contra committees but refused to give them to Walsh pending
his promise to refrain from prosecuting the four Israelis involved
in the affair.
   Negotiations with Walsh were further complicated when he
subpoenaed the four Israelis: former Foreign Ministry director
David Kimche, former counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir,
businessman Yaakov Nimrodi and his U.S.-born associate, Al
Schwimmer.
   In asking for immunity, Israel contended that the four acted at
the request of the Israeli government and therefore were not
accountable as individuals.
   Two senior Israeli officials held talks with Walsh's office 10
days ago to wind up the negotiations, which have been going on
since early 1987. The Israeli government approved the accord, said
the Israeli official.
   ``The negotiations were difficult,'' said Wieghart. ``Israel is
a sovereign state with certain national security interests, which
they have to defend. We recognized that, but on the other hand, we
had our needs in this investigation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A group of intellectuals has called
for an end to one-party government in this communist state in the
first such written statement by an official body, newspapers
reported Monday.
   The group, charged with outlining proposed changes in
Yugoslavia's constitution, asked Sunday for an ``abolition of the
monopolistic rule'' of the Communist Party, according to the
state-run Borba lectuals called for ``putting the
party into a competitive position with other (parties).''
   The statement by the unions of Serbian writers, philosophers and
sociologists was adopted at daily. The intela meeting of the writers on
Sunday.
   Several leading intellectuals in Serbia, the largest republic,
and Slovenia, the most economically developed region, have made
recent appeals for political pluralism. They have said it is a
precondition for overcoming the country's worst economic and
political crisis in history.
   In addition to rising ethnic tensions, Yugoslavia is faced with
a $20 billion foreign debt, 170 percent inflation, dropping living
standards and growing labor unrest.
   The statement also called for changes in the constitution to
allow more human rights and abolish laws permitting prosecution of
dissidents, the newspapers reported.

   A 15-year-old boy fell 20 feet to
his death after he climbed up from under the safety bar on a
carnival ride called The Orbiter, an official said.
   Demetrick Welch of Lauderhill fell when he either tried to get
out of his seat or change seats with his sister, Broward County
sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon said Sunday.
   The ride, owned by Crown Amusements of Apollo Beach, is designed
to keep passengers in their seats with centrifugal force. It has
several arms, each holding three two-seat buckets. Each bucket has
a safety bar that locks across riders.
   Crown Amusements ride superintendent Don Bodami told deputies
that no riders had been injured since The Orbiter was purchased new
in 1985. Each ride is checked daily, and The Orbiter passed a state
safety inspection last week, he said.

   The president pardoned and freed a human

   The release of Lance Sera Muwanga, 43, was announced in a letter
from President Yoweri Museveni to the Uganda Human Rights
Activists. Muwanga is secretary-general of that group.
   After he was freed, Muwanga appealed for release of hundreds of
other people he said were held as political detainees in Uganda. He
also pledged to carry on fighting for human rights in the East
African nation.
   The president's letter said the activist had been pardoned on
humanitarian grounds. Muwanga has been under guard in a Kampala
hospital for several weeks for treatment of cancer of the lymph
glands.
   Muwanga said he has never been given a reason for his detention.
He was arrested Feb. 25, 1987, two weeks after he accused
Museveni's troops of torturing and killing civilians in northern
Uganda, where the government is fighting an insurgency.

   The voice of Thumper, the bunny who
befriended Bambi in the Disney film ``Bambi,'' has been found in a
mountainside village.
   Peter Behn played Thumper in the animated film, first released
during World War II. His voice was preserved on film in the Disney
studio vaults in Burbank, Calif., but Behn was forgotten until a
few months ago.
   As Disney was preparing to release ``Bambi'' again, word
eventually reached Behn that Disney was looking for the voice of
Thumper.
   Behn, 53, has been living in Vermont since 1964, selling real
estate and designing and building homes.
   As a boy, Behn brought the lovable character to life. He only
vaguely remembers going to the Disney studios with his father, who
produced films for Howard Hughes. Behn's father thought he would be
good for the voice of Bambi.
   But casting him as Thumper was smart, said Howard Green, the
publicist who started the search for Behn.
   ``It is considered one of the absolute best voices we have done
here,'' he said.

   Joni Mitchell says she never made a record
with commercial success a prime motive.
   ``I'm a composer, not a pop star that can be decorated into
fashion,'' she said in a recent interview, talking about her move
from pop to jazz after her 1974 blockbuster album ``Court and
Spark.''
   ``I was never comfortable with all the attention I received as a
result of the success of `Court and Spark,''' she said. ``I never
courted that kind of fame because I'm a back-bush Canadian and was
raised to believe that if you stick your head up, it will probably
get knocked off.''
   But Mitchell, 44, is now out with a new album _ an upbeat pop
record called ``Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm.'' It features eight
songs with guest artists Don Henley, Tom Petty, Willie Nelson,
Peter Gabriel, Wendy & Lisa and Billy Idol.
   Is the star quotient a calculated move at commercial success?
   ``James Taylor and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were around when
I made my early records and I put them to work,'' she said. ``I
recorded some of this album at Peter Gabriel's studio and he
dropped by one day so I put him to work. I met Wendy & Lisa through
Prince, who'd been inviting me to a lot of things.
   ``What I did do here that I've never done before was seek out
singers I didn't know because I thought they were suited to songs _
Billy Idol and Willie Nelson fall into this category.''

   Actor Howard Rollins Jr. has been
charged with possessing cocaine, first-offense drunken driving and
speeding, authorities said.
   The co-star of NBC's ``Heat of the Night'' was released on
$5,000 bond.
   Senior Trooper Allen Coburn, who stopped Rollins early Sunday,
said he found two bags of a rock-like substance suspected of being
cocaine in Rollins' coat pockets.
   There was no answer to a telephone call to Rollins' motel room.
   Rollins, who co-starred as Chief of Detectives Virgil Tibbs in
the television remake of ``Heat of the Night'' and in a six-part
series of the same name, had a commission as a sheriff's deputy,
Coburn said.
   ``He had a badge holder with a Livingston Parish Sheriff's
Office badge and a full commission from the sheriff,'' Coburn said.
``He didn't say anything about it, but he made sure I saw it while
he was getting his driver's license.''
   Rollins, 37, of Baltimore, told police he was in Hammond to make
a movie. ``Heat of the Night'' was filmed in Hammond.
   Coburn said he spotted Rollins' car on Interstate 12, going a
little more than 100 mph. Coburn said a breath test indicated that
Rollins' blood alcohol level was 0.15 percent. The law sets
intoxication as 0.10 percent or more.
   Rollins' court date probably will be set in six to eight weeks.

   If his collaborators have their way, Peter
Falk may pull a crumpled raincoat from the back of a costume closet
and return to prime-time television as the endearing, bumbling Lt.
Columbo.
   Plans to revive ``Columbo,'' with Steven Spielberg directing the
first new episode, were disclosed over the weekend by the series'
co-creator, William Link.
   ``The whole thing hinges on Peter's approval,'' Link said
Saturday during a tribute to the show at the County Museum of Art.
``With Peter doing his first `Columbo' in 10 years and Steven
Spielberg directing, I think a few people might watch.''
   Link said the show would resurface on ABC if Falk, 60, ``who
never ages and looks great,'' agrees. Falk resisted earlier efforts
to revive the role.
   ``Columbo'' ran from 1971 to 1978 on NBC in a rotating format
with two other series. Spielberg directed the first episode of the
original ``Columbo'' when he was 19.

   Snow showers were scattered over the eastern Great Lakes region
today, while a strong storm system over the northern and central
Plains brought a return of winter weather to the northern Rockies.
   Meanwhile, springlike thunderstorms developed Sunday over the
High Plains of Texas and across South Dakota in the warmer air
ahead of the storm system.
   Wind gusts of 60 mph were clocked Sunday night in the northern
mountain ranges and Mojave area of California.
   Strong winds also hit the Plains, gusting to 61 mph late Sunday
evening at Goodland, Kan., and to 59 mph at La Junta, Colo., as
colder air poured into the region. Warm, southerly winds ahead of
the cold front gusted to 63 mph at Gage, Okla., and to 62 mph at
Garden City, Kan.
   Temperatures across much of western Nebraska, northeast Colorado
and northwest Kansas plummeted 25 to 40 degrees in a six-hour
period late Sunday. Readings ranged from the low 30s to upper 40s
early today.
   In the Rocky Mountain states, up to a foot of snow fell in some
areas. A rancher in central Montana reported drifts of 1 to 3 feet,
and nearly 270 miles of Interstate 15 were covered with snow, from
Butte to the Canadian border. Interstate 90 had blowing snow east
of Bozeman and near Livingston.
   In Colorado, the mercury plunged after a weekend of unseasonably
warm weather in the 70s and 80s and snow fell in many areas.
Snowmass, Winter Park and Vail ski areas all received 8 inches of
snowfall overnight, while 6 inches was reported at Aspen.
   Snowfall and slippery roads were blamed for a traffic death west
of Golden today when a tanker truck slid off a highway, killing the
driver.
   Winter storm watches covered southeast Wyoming, western Nebraska
and northwest Kansas today and tonight.
   The storms over Texas on Sunday evening were accompanied by
1{-inch diamter hail near Cotton Center, while hail an inch in
diameter fell at Tulia.
   Rain also fell in sections of the Dakotas, while snowshowers
were scattered from western Nebraska into the central Colorado
Rockies.
   Skies were clear early today across the Southeast.
   Many sections of the West and Plains enjoyed unseasonably high
temperatures again Sunday, with records broken in numerous cities.
Denver warmed to 78, breaking the 76-degree mark set in 1986.
Goodland, Kan., hit 87, besting the 78-degree record of 1971. Grand
Island, Neb., reached 81, topping the 78 mark of 1905. Tucson,
Ariz., reached 94, beating the 92 mark set in 1986.
   The forecast today called for showers and thunderstorms from the
southern Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley, with severe
thunderstorms possible across parts of western and northern Texas
into western and central Oklahoma; snow over the Rockies and in the
western portions of the northern and central Plains; rain in
western Washington and Oregon; a few morning flurries over northern
Maine; and windy conditions in the Great Plains and the Southwest.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s or 40s from New England
across the northern Great Lakes, northern Minnesota, the Dakotas,
western portions of the central Plains, the Rockies and
Intermountain West to Washington state; the 70s in coastal
California; and the 70s or 80s from the southern Atlantic states
across the Tennessee, lower Ohio and lower Mississippi valleys,
Missouri, the southern Plains and southern New Mexico to the desert
Southwest. Elsewhere, readings will be in the 50s or 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 1
degree at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 78 at Phoenix, Ariz.

<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a century after Union and
Confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from
Pennsylvania to Virginia, a group is battling developers for the
real estate.
   The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites was
organized last summer to buy land or development rights of
battlefields unprotected by the National Park Service or other
organizations.
   ``All of us have watched over the past couple of years as a
tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared,'' said Gary
W. Gallagher, a Penn State University history professor who is
president of the organization.
   ``If something isn't done in the next five years, it'll be too
late,'' he said.
   Gallagher said the organization has 500 members and has raised
more than $10,000. The organization received tax-exempt status last
month and plans to begin soliciting members this spring, he said.
   Urban sprawl from the Civil War capitals of Washington and
Richmond, Va., has engulfed many battlefields and threatens others.
   A large mall has been planned for an important part of the
Manassas battlefield in northern Virginia, where the second battle
of Bull Run was fought.
   Annie Snyder, who lives on a 180-acre farm adjacent to the
battlefield, earlier this year organized a group called Save The
Battlefield Coalition to fight the mall.
   Also, five parcels of land on the Cedar Creek battlefield, near
Winchester, Va., are for sale.
   ``One of the Cedar Creek sites has already been targeted as a
light industrial park, and it will be a light industrial park
unless someone buys that ground before the end of the year,'' he
said.
   Many of the former battlefields are farm or pasture land.
Encroaching development has raised real estate prices and taxes,
according to Gallagher.
   ``It's difficult to go to a land owner who hasn't been able to
make it as a farmer and has just been offered $2 million for his
land. How do you convince that person not to take the $2 million
and run?'' he said.
   Gallagher said the formation of the group was prompted last
summer by a developers who slipped bulldozers onto northern
Virginia's Chantilly Battlefield in the middle of the night.
   Initially, the developers had agreed to delay any excavation
until historical surveying could be conducted, according to
Gallagher. Only five acres were preserved to commemorate the
battle, he said.
   The National Park Service owns and maintains several Civil War
battlefields, including sites in Gettysburg, Antietam, Monassas,
Fredericksburg, Appomatox and Richmond.
   Many others remain unprotected, Gallagher said.
   Among them are sites in the Shenandoah Valley, where Confederate
General Stonewall Jackson staged his 1862 campaign, and at Brandy
Station, in north-central Virginia, the site of the largest cavalry
battle in the Western Hemisphere, Gallagher said.
   Gallagher said the organization plans to buy land or development
rights and turn the property over to historical societies or
government organizations to manage.
   ``We're not talking about buying thousands and thousands of
acres. We know some growth is inevitable. We just think there has
to be some balance between growth and preserving a part of our
past,'' he said.

   Charles Willeford, whose detective
novels featured Miami homicide Detective Hoke Moseley, died of a
heart attack at his South Miami home. He was 69.
   Willeford, who died Sunday, had spent decades writing everything
from paperback fiction to poetry to an autobiographical account of
war.
   ``I was taken with his dark humor. I almost had a guilty
enjoyment of it,'' said Jared Kieling, a senior editor with St.
Martin's Press, publisher of the first three Moseley books. ``There
was an outrageousness that stood out from the commonplace books in
the category.''
   Willeford's most recent book, ``The Way We Die Now,'' was
published this month by Random House. He wrote 13 novels before the
Moseley series, which also included ``Miami Blues,'' ``New Hope for
the Dead'' and `Sideswipe.''
   Survivors include his wife, Betsy Willeford, and stepson Stephen
Hooker of New Orleans.

   A late winter blizzard paralyzed dozens
of cities and towns in western Canada on Monday, closing major
highways and stranding more than 1,000 motorists.
   The storm began Sunday and travelers were forced to seek
overnight shelter in school gyms and hockey rinks along the
Trans-Canada Highway east of the Olympic city of Calgary and along
Highway 2 from Calgary to Edmonton.
   When the blizzard struck Calgary International Airport on
Sunday, more than 120 passengers on an Air Canada jet spent seven
hours on the runway, unable to take off. Visibility was too poor
for the crew to get the plane back to the terminal building a few
hundred yards away.
   ``Most of us just slept and we had our breakfast on the plane,''
said one passenger, Spiro Plagakis, an engineer from Montreal.
   The wet snow toppled power lines, leaving many communities
without electricity or telephone service.
   The town of Camrose, 42 miles southeast of Edmonton, got more
than 20 inches of snow.

<TEXT>
   About 800 American soldiers
deployed in Honduras in a show of force against Nicaragua left
today aboard seven C-141 cargo planes bound for the United States.
   The soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were whistling and
shouting as they boarded the planes, the first of the American
contingent to leave Honduras.
   ``This is nice, it's beautiful,'' said Sgt. Elliott Cook, 22, of
Miami, when he saw the planes to carry him and his fellow soldiers
home. ``I am happy to go home because nothing happened.''
   Outside the Palmerola Air Base, about 200 Hondurans demonstrated
their support for the Americans.
   They carried signs saying, ``Thanks for having helped us
maintain our liberty'' and ``Unity makes for democracy, thanks for
being here.''
   The paratroopers were scheduled for an airdrop into their home
base of Fort Bragg, N.C.
   They are part of a force rushed to Honduras for 11 days of
training exercises to flex U.S. military muscles after a reported
incursion by about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops chasing U.S.-supported
Contra rebels.
   ``I'm sure they'll be home for a late dinner at least,'' Maj.
Gary Hovatter, the U.S. military public affairs officer at this
base 40 miles northwest of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa,
said Sunday. He said the soldiers would probably parachute into
Fort Bragg at about 5 p.m. EST today.
   ``It's great to be going home,'' said Sgt. Dale Taylor, 22, of
Red Springs, N.C. ``It's going to be a sis-boom-bah occasion.
They're going to have a band and our families will be there.''
   President Reagan ordered 3,200 paratroopers and light infantry
to Honduras on March 17 and 18. Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo
asked for a show of force against after the reported incursion.
   Nicaragua denied the report and claimed the United States was
preparing to invade or using the deployment as a cover for
providing equipment to the Contras. U.S. officials have said the
troops are taking back all the equipment they brought with them,
including tanks and aircraft.
   ``First they'll have to go through a complete inventory of
property to make sure they can account for all the equipment they
brought,'' Hovatter said.
   In addition to the 82nd Airborne, the reinforcements include
soldiers from the 7th Light Infantry in Fort Ord, Calif. All are
expected home by Wednesday.
   The presence of the reinforcements, which raised U.S. strength
in Honduras to more than 6,000, alarmed the region and raised the
already high level of tension. Tensions eased when the Contras and
the Sandinistas signed a broad cease-fire accord last week after
three days of talks in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   The U.S. troops never saw action, but the Honduran president
said all along he expected them to back him up if the Sandinistas
didn't withdraw.
   By late last week, Honduran officials said the Nicaraguan troops
were back on their own side of the border.
   Capt. Steve Walker, 30, of New Milford, N.J., said he thinks the
strong U.S. presence helped bring about the cease-fire.
   ``The Nicaraguans did cease action and they did withdraw and
they did sit down and start negotiation with the Contras without
any shots being fired,'' he said. ``It was an effective display of
resolve.''

<HEAD>Opposition Party Leader Arrested for Explosives; Expelled From
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERRE-YVES GLASS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An opposition party leader was
arrested and two Americans were under house detention today in
connection with an explosion at a bridge in Port-au-Prince, party
officials said.
   Joseph Douze, second in command of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, was arrested Saturday and charged in connection
with last week's blast under the Croix des Bouquets Bridge. The
explosion Tuesday caused no damage or injuries, party leader Sylvio
Claude confirmed.
   Claude said Douze, a medical doctor with dual Haitian and
American citizenship, had been planted in the party by the
government. Douze, who had served as the party's provisional vice
president, was expelled, Claude said.
   Douze was filmed by the state television station Saturday night
during a search of his home by soldiers.
   The Americans, Nancy Horn, of Wells Tannley, Pa., and James
Gunnels, of Macon, Ga., told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview that they were friends of Douze's and were staying at his
home in Thomassin, outside Port-au-Prince, at the time of his
arrest.
   Horn identified herself as an associate of Douze and said she
had been in Haiti since 1967. Gunnels said he was a businessman
visiting the country.
   The officer in charge of the search of Douze's home said on
state television Sunday the two Americans ``have a certain
responsibility in the affair.'' The officer did not elaborate.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said U.S. consular officials
had been in contact with Horn and Gunnels and that he did not know
if they would be formally arrested although they had been barred
from leaving the house.
   Horn and Gunnels said they did not know anything about the
bombing.
   ``I know nothing about this affair,'' Gunnels said. ``I was just
a guest in his home for a few days.''
   The two said they had been treated well by the army.
   Horn said Douze was in his mid-40s and of Haitian origin and had
lived several years in the United States during the Duvalier
dictatorship, which lasted from 1957 to 1986.
   Claude accused the government of President Leslie Manigat of
planting members in his party to try to discredit and destroy it.
Claude, a Protestant pastor, was one of the four most popular
presidential candidates in the Nov. 29 elections suspended because
of widespread violence.
   The state-run Television Nationale reported Sunday that Douze
was arrested for possession of detonators, wiring for explosives, a
remote control detonating device, ammunition and clips for
automatic assault rifles.
   On Wednesday the Christian Democratic Party's head of security,
Jocelin Brochard, a former army corporal, and two women were
arrested in connection with the bombing of the bridge. Several
sticks of dynamite, two assault rifles and a large bag of marijuana
were found stashed on the roof of the women's home in the
Port-au-Prince slum of Bel-Air.
   Brochard said on state televison last week that Douze supplied
the weapons.
   Claude denied knowing that Brochard or Douze were involved in
the bombing, but said some members of the party who have advocated
violence have been expelled in the past.

   It wasn't quite gold at the end of the
rainbow, but one amateur sleuth didn't complain about his jackpot.
   Dale McRae struck silver _ or, more accurately, a laminated card
declaring him the winner of a treasure hunt _ at the base of a
telephone pole guy wire at Katherine Drive and Monroe Avenue on
Friday.
   ``I reached down at the base of the guy wire, and there it
was,'' McRae said. ``I didn't even look. I just knew that was it.''
   Joe Cramer, who owns a car care shop in this Grand Rapids
suburb, each year offers a prize of silver to the first person to
solve a complicated riddle. Cramer issued a 77-word riddle on Nov.
20 to start the latest hunt and gave short clues on the 20th of
each following month.
   The original riddle mentioned a large woman singer _ maybe Kate
Smith? And Monroe came from the mention ``first'' (mono) and
``caviar'' (roe).
   McRae recognized in the final clue a mathematical formula for
calculating the sides of a triangle, and the riddle suggested
looking for a ``little support.'' He spied the triangular shape of
the wire and the pole, and the prize was his.
   McRae's wife, Kathy, said their home is too small to properly
display the silver serving tray, engraved cup and silver coins they
won, but she added, ``Someday we'll have a big house, and then
we'll really be able to enjoy it.''

   Beach-goers seeking to escape the
city found something unexpected: a quarter-mile-long swath of sand
imprinted with a cityscape of Los Angeles by a 14-ton concrete
roller.
   ``I like it, but I think it is a bit crazy,'' said Sandra
Soderberg, 20, a tourist from Sweden who witnessed the progression
Sunday of the ``Santa Monica Art Tool.''
   With a $60,000 commission from the seaside city, the National
Endowment for the Arts and another non-profit arts group, artist
Carl Cheng crafted his unusual device to bring art to the masses.
   Designs carved into the surface of the roller left _ for the
moment at least _ two-inch-tall sand replicas of such city scenes
as the Memorial Coliseum and a traffic-choked freeway.
   ``I like going to the general public and making a project
interesting to them, not just the art collectors, said Cheng, 46,
of Los Angeles.
   Initial reviews were favorable.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Paul Schneider, 47, of Los Angeles. ``I
like the fact that the city is putting its money into art that can
be appreciated by thousands of people. It's art that is also an
event.''
   Cheng's work is the second commissioned for Santa Monica beaches
as part of a 10-piece ``Natural Elements Sculpture Park.''
   The roller will go on permanent display near the Santa Monica
pier.

<HEAD>Jurors in Chambers Trial Say They Could Have Reached Verdict</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `As part ...,' with 1 graf to recast,
clarifying that a sexual encounter that turned rough was part of
Chambers' story before his plea.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors in the Robert Chambers murder trial said
today that the jury, though bogged down in circumstantial evidence,
could have reached a verdict.
   ``I feel very firmly that we could have reached a verdict,''
said juror Cole Wallace, interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' program.
   ``We never reached a dead end,'' said juror Mike Ognibene,
interviewed on the same program. ``We were judging with a
circumstantial case and there was a great deal of discretion
involved in reaching the decision.''
   Chambers agreed to plead guilty last Friday to first-degree
manslaughter and an unrelated burglary charge to end his trial on
murder charges in the death of Jennifer Dawn Levin during a Central
Park tryst. The agreement followed nine days of deliberations and
both the prosecution and defense feared a hung jury.
   As part of the plea bargain, Chambers, who had maintained since
his arrest that he killed Miss Levin accidentally during a sexual
encounter that turned rough, acknowledged he intended to hurt the
18-year-old woman the night of her death.
   Chambers entered the Rikers Island jail Saturday to await
sentencing April 15. He faces a five-to-15-year prison term for
killing Miss Levin under the bargain.
   ``We were shocked that that's how it ended,'' juror Ginny Hoesl
said of the plea bargain in an interview on ``CBS This Morning.''
She said Chambers would have been convicted, but it was impossible
to say on what charge.
   Betsy Shankin, a friend of Jennifer Levin's, said on the same
program that she would have preferred a jury verdict, but was
satisfied that Chambers had to admit his guilt as part of his plea.
She wished for a longer sentence, however, saying, ``I don't think
it will ever be enough for him.''
   On Sunday, Monsignor Thomas Leonard, who helped counsel Chambers
after his arrest, said Chambers would issue a statement soon about
the killing.
   ``I think that ... he will make some sort of statement of how
sorry he is for the trouble this has caused the Levin family and
for his own family,'' he said.
   In a separate development, Chambers' lawyer, Jack Litman,
ridiculed allegations by Assistant District Attorney Linda
Fairstein that his client forged $7,000 worth of stolen checks in
October and used some of it to buy drugs.
   ``The scandalous claims by the prosecutors are made in an
obvious attempt to save face for having allowed Robert Chambers to
receive a sentence in the range of reckless manslaughter when they
proclaimed from the rooftop that Robert Chambers intentionally
murdered Jennifer Levin,'' he said Saturday.
   Fairstein said she didn't want to provoke a mistrial by making
the allegation public earlier.
   As part of the plea bargain, Chambers is immune from prosecution
from any other past crimes.
   Prosecutors had said that the burglary to which Chambers pleaded
guilty was committed to support his cocaine habit, for which he was
institutionalized twice.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   EASTER SEAL-PLAYBOY
   
   The court turned away an unusual copyright dispute that pitted
the Easter Seal Society against Playboy Enterprises.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that
Playboy illegally used materials intended for an Easter Seal
telethon in a pornographic movie.
   The case is Easter Seal Society vs. Playboy Enterprises, 87-482.
   
   TRIVIAL PURSUIT
   
   The court refused to revive a $300 million
copyright-infringement lawsuit against the creators and marketers
of Trivial Pursuit, a popular board game.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the author of
several encyclopedias on trivia that many of the questions
contained in the board game infringed on his copyright works.
   The case is Worth vs. Selchow & Righter Co., 87-1268.
   
   RECESS
   
   The court agreed to hear the appeal of a convicted killer who
said his rights were violated when he was denied an opportunity to
talk to his lawyer during a trial recess.
   The court said it will review a ruling that denied a new trial
to the South Carolina man.
   The case is Perry vs. Leeke, 87-6325.
   
   MEADE ESPOSITO
   
   The court refused to hear an appeal by former New York City
political boss Meade Esposito, who sought to prevent public
disclosure of certain court documents.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling challenged by
Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic boss convicted of giving
illegal gratuities to Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y.
   The case is Esposito vs. New York Times, 87-1319.
   
   GHOSTWRITING
   
   The court refused to disqualify a bankruptcy judge from
presiding over a Georgia case in which he ordered the winning side
to ghostwrite opinions he then signed.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
judge's actions, while ill-advised, did not violate the losing
side's rights.
   The case is Colony Square vs. Prudential Insurance Co., 87-1299.

   Senate Democrats failed again today to end
debate on a bill that would require the government to notify
100,000 to 300,000 workers a year that they risk cancer and other
disabling diseases from exposure to toxic substances on the job.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said a fourth
attempt at ending what some proponents of the legislation have
branded as a Republican filibuster will be made Tuesday. Two
attempts last week failed.
   Byrd indicated, however, that tomorrow's move could be the last
effort to force a final Senate vote on the House-passed bill if its
sponsors cannot muster the 60 votes necessary to limit further
debate to 30 hours.
   Unlike ending a filibuster, passage of a bill requires only a
simple majority _ 51 votes if all 100 senators are present.
   The 41-44 vote today to cut off debate indicated that Sens.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
chief authors of the bill, had picked up only slight support by
exempting farm workers and companies with less than 100 full-time
employees.
   Metzenbaum and Hatch mustered 33 votes last week for ending a
threat by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., to
prolong the debate indefinitely and prevent the Senate from moving
on to other measures.
   A few southern Democrats and liberal Republicans who had voted
with Hatch and Quayle last week voted with Metzenbaum and Kennedy
today.
   The bill would establish a panel of experts to identify the most
hazardous substances in workplaces and the groups of employees most
susceptible to disabling diseases because of exposure to them.
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health would
be required to notify 100,000 to 300,000 of those workers every
year at an annual cost of $25 million.
   Employers then would be required to finance medical monitoring
program for them at a cost of up to $250 each annually.
   If, as a result of the monitoring, a physician recommends
transferring an employee to less hazardous work, employers would
have to pay the same level of wages and benefits to the worker in
the new job. In the event no other job is available, the employee
would be entitled to full wages and benefits for up to a year after
leaving a job.

   Voters in two southern Mississippi
congressional districts will select nominees Tuesday for seats that
Trent Lott and Wayne Dowdy gave up to run for the U.S. Senate.
   The runoff elections in the 4th and 5th Districts are necessary
because no candidate received a majority in the primaries on Super
Tuesday.
   In the 4th District that has been represented by Dowdy, a
Democrat, since 1981, the Democratic runoff pits Brad Pigott, a
33-year-old Jackson attorney, against political newcomer Mike
Parker, 38, of Brookhaven. Thomas Collins III, the executive
director of the Mississippi Veterans Home Purchase Board, faces
30-year-old Jackson attorney Andy Taggart on the GOP side.
   Polls show both races very close.
   In the 5th District, state Sen. Gene Taylor of Bay St. Louis
tests Glenn White of Hattiesburg, while 43-year-old Sheriff Larkin
Smith of Gulfport and Hattiesburg businessman George Robert Hall,
57, face off in the Republican runoff.
   A recent poll showed Smith with a decided edge, while the
Democatic race was rated a toss-up.
   Lott, a Republican, was first elected from the 5th District in
1972.

   The Israeli army will close off the entire West
Bank and Gaza Strip for three days in expectation of major
demonstrations called by the PLO to mark a Palestinian anniversary,
the army announced today.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Palestinian residents will be
confined to their homes for three day, the army said. In the West
Bank, Palestinian residents will be restricted to their cities and
villages.
   Arabs will be prevented from entering the area from Israel but
the 65,000 Jewish settlers living in the territories will be
allowed to travel freely, the army spokesman said.
   Maj. Gen. Ephraim Lapid said the army also would bar
Palestinians from leaving the West Bank via the two bridges across
the Jordan river. Incoming traffic from Jordan would be permitted,
he said.
   U.N. figures say 119 Arabs have been killed since unrest began
in the occupied territories Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been
killed.
   Lapid said only pool press coverage will be allowed during the
three-day period. Reporters will be accompanied by a military
spokesman, the official said.
   ``The purpose is to keep the territories quiet. It is not
directed specifically against the press, but we don't want to give
the people of the areas any reason for causing disturbances,'' said
a senior defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The measures were to take effect at 1 a.m. Tuesday on the West
Bank and 10 p.m. tonight in the Gaza Strip. Five-hour nightly
curfews are already in effect in Gaza.
   Israel's 24-member Cabinet authorized the measures in its weekly
session Sunday, Israeli officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the move
was calculated to lessen tensions Wednesday, when Palestinians will
mark Land Day, the 12th anniversary of a 1976 clash between Israeli
soldiers and Arabs over the confiscation of Arab land. Six Arabs
were killed.
   Underground leaflets signed by the PLO have called for major
demonstrations throughout Israel and the occupied territories to
mark the occasion, a traditional time of unrest in recent years.
   Israeli officials have maintained press coverage, especially the
presence of television cameras, has incited Palestinians to stage
violent protests that might otherwise not have taken place.
   Robert Slater, head of the Foreign Press Association in Israel,
sharply protested the action and said the group was considering
legal action.
   ``We reject this as we have for the last four months,'' Slater
told The Associated Press. ``The foreign press stands united in its
determination to cover this story in person and wherever the story
takes us.''
   Also today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir sharply protested a
meeting between U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and two
Arab-Americans tied to the PLO.
   A 19-year-old Palestinian, meanwhile, died of wounds he suffered
during a clash Sunday in the West Bank village of Salfit. Hussein
Kamel Odeh died of a gunshot wound to the heart, Israel radio and
the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said.
   The army said villagers attacked troops who came to rescue a
tour bus that mistakenly entered the village.
   But 10 American and European academics on the bus denied the
army report and said troops used their presence as a pretext to
raid the village. Another 14-year-old Arab boy also died in the
clash.
   Also today, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's chief spokesman was quoted
as saying Shultz will have more meetings with PLO-affiliated
officials, possibly when the secretary of state visits the Middle
East beginning April 3.
   Shultz met in Washington on Saturday with Edward Said and
Ibrahim Abu Lughod, both American citizens and members of the
Palestine National Council, the parliament-in-exile of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel has always refused to negotiate with the PLO and Israeli
officials contend the Shultz meeting violated a longstanding U.S.
commitment not to deal with the PLO.
   Shamir's criticism of Shultz's meeting speech came a day after
ministers of the center-left Labor Party told a stormy Cabinet
meeting visit that Israel must adopt a U.S. peace plan if it hopes
to end violence in the occupied lands.
   Before his visit to the United States last week, Shamir had
blocked any debate on the peace plan which involves Israel giving
land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace.

<HEAD>US `Regrets' Israeli Moves On West Bank and Gaza</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, which has restricted
American travel to the West Bank and Gaza, today said it regretted
Israel's decision to seal off the territories for three days in
expectation of major demonstrations called by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Israeli move would have an
impact on commerce, visits between family members and the press.
   Both Israelis and Arabs will be prevented from entering the two
areas. The only exception will be the 65,000 Jewish settlers who
live in the territories.
   A total of 119 Palestinian Arabs and an Israeli soldier have
died since violent protests broke out Dec. 9. The State Department,
citing ``continuing disturbances,'' last Friday advised U.S.
citizens to avoid travel to the areas until further notice.
   The warning also could have an impact on tourism and business,
especially during Holy Week.
   Redman reaffirmed, meanwhile, that U.S. policy prohibits dealing
with the PLO as well as negotiating or recognizing the group until
it accepts Israel's right to exist and disavows terrorism.
   The spokesman said Secretary of State George P. Shultz's meeting
here Saturday with two American members of the Palestine National
Council did not conflict with the 13-year-old policy.
   The council considers itself the legislative arm of the
Palestinian nationalist movement. One of the two Palestinians,
Edward Said, said he informed PLO chairman Yasser Arafat before he
and Ibrahim Abu-Lughod met with Shultz.
   Redman said that the PLO and the council were not ``synonymous''
and that ``our restrictions on dealing with the PLO remain as
always.''
   Shultz will go to the Middle East on Sunday for five days of
talks with Arab and Israeli leaders on his proposal to open
negotiations by May 1.
   He will make stops in Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
   Shultz presented his proposal to Arab and Israeli leaders four
weeks ago
   and asked for a reply by mid-March. So far, only Egypt has
endorsed his plan.

   Trumpeter Al Hirt was released from the hospital
Monday after a four-day stay for treatment of a hand and arm
ailment, officials said.
   ``He had been treated by Dr. Michael DeBakey for an acute
infection of the right hand and arm, which is his playing hand,''
said Methodist Hospital spokeswoman Brenda Blake. ``The outlook is
excellent.''
   Hirt, 65, flew to Houston on Thursday from his home in New
Orleans so he could be treated by DeBakey, a friend.
   Hirt said his doctors believed the problem may be related to his
trumpet playing and a growth that developed on a finger of his
right hand after 59 years of playing.
   Hirt canceled an appearance Thursday in New Orleans and a
weekend gig in Fairfield, Conn., so he could be treated.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, have
signed a three-year lease on a $2.5 million estate in the Bel Air
section of Los Angeles to live in after they leave the White House
next January, the White Hose said today.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, said the Reagans
signed the lease and mailed it within the last 10 days. The lease
gives them an option to purchase the house and its 1\ acres of
grounds.
   The amount of the lease payments was not disclosed.
   A group of about 20 friends of the Reagans set up a firm called
Wall Management Services and purchased the estate on Aug. 21, 1986,
saying they did so with the understanding they would be reimbursed
by the Reagans.
   The estate includes a secluded house with 6,500 feet of living
space and a pool. It was purchased from a 90-year-old woman who at
the time of the purchase still lived in the house.
   At the time of the purchase, Mrs. Crispen said the Reagans had
not yet chosen a home and might decide to purchase a different one.
   She said today the investors had purchased the home as an option
for the Reagans and ``it is one they have decided on.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday approved a bill that would
make it easier for a parent to recover a child who is abducted and
taken to a foreign country, often by the other parent.
   The measure, passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would
enable the U.S. government to implement an international treaty
intended to overcome complex, time-consuming legal issues blocking
the prompt return of abducted children from a foreign country.
   The United States signed the treaty in 1981. Although it was
approved by the Senate in October 1986, the United States has not
ratified the pact because the State Department said implementing
legislation was needed first.
   The treaty provides for the prompt return of children abducted
from their country or wrongfully kept in a foreign country, and
provides for visitation rights across international borders.
   The bill provides for accelerated procedures by the courts of
nine foreign countries that have ratified the treaty for returning
abducted children to their U.S. parents.
   The bill would direct state courts, when petitioned by foreign
parents, to order children returned to their habitual residence
abroad, even if there is no legal order establishing custody.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Attempt To Collect Damages From Playboy In Film Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused to rule that
Playboy Enterprises violated federal copyright law when it used
material intended for an Easter Seal telethon in a pornographic
movie.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected an attempt by
the Easter Seal Society to collect damages from Playboy.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Agreed to hear the appeal of a convicted South Carolina killer
who says his rights were violated when he was forbidden to talk to
his lawyer during a trial recess.
   _Agreed to study a challenge to the way Webster County, W.Va.,
assesses real estate for property tax purposes. The county's policy
of reassessing recently sold property at half the sale price means
some land is assessed 6,500 percent higher than similar property.
   _Refused to revive a $300 million copyright-infringement lawsuit
against the creators and marketers of Trivial Pursuit, a popular
board game. The justices rejected arguments by the author of
several encyclopedias on triva that many of the questions contained
in the game infringed on his copyright works.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by former New York City political
boss Meade Esposito, convicted of giving illegal gratuties to Rep.
Mario Biaggi, R-N.Y., that sought to prevent public disclosure of
certain court documents in the case.
   The Easter Seal Society vs. Playboy case dates back to 1982,
when New Orleans musician and entertainer Ronnie Kole, acting on
behalf of the society, contracted with public television station
WYES to make a videotape of a staged Mardi Gras-style parade and
Dixieland jam session.
   The videotape was edited into a 16-minute version for the
society's national telethon for crippled children, and was
broadcast March 28, 1982.
   A year later, WYES provided an unedited copy of the Easter Seal
tape to a television producer. Portions of the tape were
incorporated into a movie entitled ``Candy, The Stripper,'' a
sexually explicit film carried on cable television's Playboy
Channel.
   Some viewers in the New Orleans area who had taken part in the
staged Mardis Gras parade, seeing themselves in the pornographic
movie, complained. The society then sued Playboy Enterprises, WYES,
and others _ accusing them of copyright violations.
   The society said it, and not WYES, owns the copyright on the
videotape.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the society
last April. The appeals court said Congress in 1976 limited the
copyright protection for those who hire others to produce original
works.
   Only Justice Byron R. White voted Monday to hear arguments in
the case. Four votes were needed to grant review to the society's
appeal.

<HEAD>Governor's Impeachment Trial Enters Second Month</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to UPDATE with Mecham clash with
prosecutor, picking up 5th graf pvs, `Today, the ....'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham today lashed out at the
prosecutor at his impeachment trial for comparing his use of a
protocol fund to a bank official's embezzling money.
   ``I resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence,'' the
first-term Republican governor told prosecutor William French as
French and presiding officer Frank Gordon Jr. tried to silence him.
   ``I'm insulted by it,'' Mecham said. ``I have seen no other
witness who has been insulted as I have been.''
   However, Gordon admonished Mecham against making his statement
without being asked a question, saying, ``I hope, sir, that you
believe that the rules are for you as well as everybody else.''
   Mecham, testifying as the impeachment trial entered its second
month, said he never tried to hide an $80,000 loan from the
governor's protocol fund to his auto dealership from the public or
from other business creditors.
   The Arizona Senate is hearing evidence on three charges to
determine whether the first-term Republican should be removed from
office.
   Mecham argued that the loan was legitimate, saying, ``A loan is
one thing and an expenditure is much, much different.'' He
contended he also could have legally borrowed the money to buy
himself a car, and he also could have loaned the money to his wife
as long as she paid it back.
   French asked Mecham whether a bank officer could avoid
embezzlement charges if he borrowed bank funds, as long as he paid
it back. That question led to the governor's outburst.
   The governor also testified today that he thought somebody must
have been monitoring his telephone calls for the prosecutor to
learn that he phoned a witness.
   But French said that the witness told a member of the
prosecution staff about the call.
   Mecham's former chief of staff, Jim Colter, initially testified
about the matter Tuesday. When he returned to the stand the next
morning, he testified under questioning from French that he had
gotten a call on his answering machine from the governor saying
``that I had done a good job or something to that effect.''
   Today, the governor said, ``There was no intention to contact
Jim,'' adding that he was ``shocked'' that French found out about
the call.
   The governor said he had made the call to inquire about Colter's
health and to say he looked well.
   ``Somebody had to be monitoring my phone calls to ever know
that. ... I couldn't figure out any other reason, Mr. French, that
you would'' know about the call, said Mecham, who once said he
feared laser beams were being used to eavesdrop on his office.
   ``That's just an assumption on my part,'' the governor added.
   French then asked the governor if he would be surprised if
Colter had told a member of French's staff about the call.
   ``Yes, that would surprise me, but if you tell me that I'll
accept it,'' the governor said.
   The Senate already has heard testimony on a charge that Mecham
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a
state official.
   The third impeachment charge accuses him of concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan. The governor also faces an April 21
criminal trial on six felony counts related to the loan.
   The Senate could decide this week to vote on the first two
allegations without hearing the third. A conviction would
automatically remove Mecham from office, although the trial could
continue on the third charge to decide if the governor should be
barred from holding future public office.
   The Senate last week dropped a proposal to allow a vote after
the first count, and some senators predicted the same would happen
this week.
   ``I imagine there will be more votes for it, but I doubt there
will be enough,'' Majority Leader Bob Usdane said Sunday. He added
there is a chance the trial might not end before a May 17 recall
election as some senators want.
   Fellow Republican Sen. Greg Lunn said senators should hear all
the evidence before voting whether to convict Mecham.
   However, Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, said Sunday
there was a danger that hearing testimony in the Senate on the
$350,000 loan charge might make it impossible to empanel an
impartial jury in criminal court. In that case, he said, ``We look
pretty bad.''
   A two-thirds Senate margin would be required to change the rules
and allow an early vote.
   On Friday, Mecham testified that he was told by fund-raiser Bill
Long he could spend the protocol fund ```for any damn thing you
want' _ those are his words _ `except you can't spend it for
politics or for personal living expenses.'''
   Long submitted an affidavit Friday contending that he never
intended to turn the inaugural proceeds into state funds and that
he believed they were being turned over to Mecham for his personal
use.
   The prosecution contends the protocol fund, created with
proceeds from inaugural fund-raising events, became public money
when it was turned over to the governor's office. Mecham Pontiac
needed the $80,000 loan to meet its July payroll, according to
prosecution testimony.
   However, the defense contends Mecham Pontiac was in good shape
and that the protocol fund was private money that Mecham could use
as he saw fit, except for personal living expenses or to retire his
campaign debt.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham, who is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six
decades.

   They groan and squeak, lurch forward and
rock backward, but as the quaint little cable cars on Powell Street
turned 100 today they're being celebrated by thousands of adoring
fans.
   Costumed characters, including one portraying cable car inventor
Andrew S. Hallidie, rode 14 cars decorated like floats as perennial
bell-ringing champion Carl Payne rang out Dixieland melodies and a
Navy jazz band led the way.
   ``It's great to be part of this celebration. It's really
special,'' Payne said, adding optimistically, ``I'm hoping to be
here at the 200-year mark.''
   A $40-a-plate luncheon to raise money for the homeless was
scheduled after the parade, along with the release of 15,000
balloons and the serving of a giant birthday cake cut into 1,000
pieces.
   The Powell Street line, though younger than its sister line on
California Street, whose centennial 15 years ago set off a wild
two-week bash, is longer and more picturesque, earning a special
place in the hearts of San Franciscans and millions of tourists.
   Folks sometimes help push the trolleys at the turnaround on
Powell and Market, getting a hands-on sense of history on a moving
national landmark as the cars climb past Union Square and Chinatown
to Fisherman's Wharf, with a view of Alcatraz as a bonus.
   Presidents and movie stars have rumbled up and down Powell
during the past century, enjoying breathtaking vistas on some of
the city's steepest slopes.
   There were spectacular accidents and annoying breakdowns, but
most of the time the trolleys kept rolling, clickety clack at 9{
mph, on millions of trips through fog and earthquakes in a
constantly changing city.
   Today the two Powell Street lines carry about 41,000 passengers
a day on 3{-mile rides that take about 25 minutes each.
   ``You could have seen a lot of change from these cars over the
past 100 years,'' says gripman Phillip Shaw, who's plied Powell for
26 years. ``Only the hills stay the same.''
   ``If you close your eyelids halfway and tune out most of the
noise except for the bell and the wheels, you can almost imagine
yourself riding along in the 1800s,'' says Jeffery Fleischmann, a
visitor from Dallas.
   Powell Street is where perennial bell-ringing champ Carl Payne,
another 26-year veteran, chimes through town, delighting riders
with his melodies and stories.
   At night, when fog creeps over the city, there isn't a more
soulful sound than the muffled peals of a cable car bell.
   ``Being on a cable car, you're back in history and it shows you
how good people had it back then,'' Payne says.

<HEAD>South African Soldiers Raid Botswana, Kill 4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN PARKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African soldiers raided a house
on the outskirts of this border capital early Monday, killing a man
and three women during an hour-long gun battle.
   The South African Defense Force claimed responsibility in a
statement issued in Pretoria 10 hours after the attack ended about
2 a.m.
   It described the victims as ``terrorists'' of the African
National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting white
domination in South Africa.
   Both the United States and Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N.
secretary-general, condemned the raid. State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said: ``It appears the South African authorities
made no attempt to seek the cooperation of the Botswana authorities
in dealing with the alleged security threat.''
   In Gaborone, President Quett Masire's office said the man was
South African, two women were Botswanans and the third woman had
not been identified.
   According to the statement, all were sleeping when the South
Africans attacked at 1 a.m. in an area of the Phiring suburb called
Tsholofelo.
   ``The office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly
attack and murder of innocent people in Botswana by the South
African army,'' it said. ``South Africa's problems cannot be
resolved by attacking neighboring countries such as Botswana.''
   Botswana ``strongly urges the South African government to engage
in meaningful negotiations with the genuine leadership of the
oppressed majority in that country,'' the statement said.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and
economy, and the 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs.
   The statement from the South African military called the raid a
follow-up to a shootout near the border with Botswana on Friday,
which had not been reported previously. In that attack soldiers
killed ``three suspected terrorists'' in a running battle near a
farm, capturing rifles, machine pistols and hand grenades, the
statement said.
   ``Following up on intelligence gathered during Friday's
operation, an element of the Defense Force killed four more
terrorists ... on the northern outskirts of Gaborone early today,''
it said.
   Monday's raid provides ``further evidence that ANC terrorists,
originating from Zambia and Zimbabwe, use Botswana as a transit
route to infiltrate into South Africa,'' it said.
   Defense Minister Magnas Malan said the ``pre-emptive'' raid
``resulted in the prevention of killings and maimings of innocent
people at a later stage.''
   A dispatch from the Botswana Press Association quoted Norman
Moleboge, the deputy police commissioner, as saying the four
victims were shot and set afire, and gasoline containers were found
at the scene. It said an explosion may have been caused by a gas
cylinder in the house.
   Neighbors said they heard sporadic fire from automatic weapons,
and possibly grenade explosions. They reported seeing people flee
in a vehicle and others run into the bush. Two said the raiders
left in a helicopter.
   One witness said a woman ran from the house and sought shelter
in his home.
   South Africa has issued several threats to Botswana in the past
few months, accusing it of harboring African National Congress
guerrillas.
   Masire's government supports ANC goals and allows its
representatives in the country, but says it does not permit
guerrillas to attack South Africa from Botswana's territory.
   The South African military has raided alleged guerrilla hideouts
in Botswana several times in recent years. One person was killed in
an attack in May 1986 and a raid in June 1985 left 15 dead.

   Singer Dennis Day is out of the

   Day's ``vital signs are stable and he is showing some response

   Day, 71, was hospitalized March 9 after falling at his Bel-Air

brain; a second operation for the same problem was performed March
19.
   Day was diagnosed last July as suffering from amyotropic lateral
sclerosis. The progressive nerve disorder, also known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, causes a loss of muscle control.
   Day, who was born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York City, began
his career with comedian Jack Benny in 1939. An accomplished tenor,
Day played the innocent foil to Benny's character on television and
radio, breaking into song to counter Benny's anger or tricking him
into letting him sing.

<TEXT>
   Three Cabinet officers unveiled a guide to
workplace literacy Monday that includes tips for businesses to
learn just how well or poorly their workers read.
   The three officials _ Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, Education
Secretary William J. Bennett and Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity _ all agreed that bolstering the basic skills of workers is
essentially to maintaining a strong economy.
   The Education and Labor departments published the 50-page
guidebook, ``The Bottom Line, Basic Skills in the Workplace.''
   It was Verity who provided the most gripping example of problems
which companies face with illiteracy in the workforce.
   ``Basic workplace literacy is an absolute necessity if we are to
increase our productivity, remain competitive in the global
marketplace and continue to be a world leader,'' Verity said.
   He said he had learned of one company that wanted to hire 100
people for two shifts at a new, state-of-the-art plant, but had
trouble finding workers capable of performing fifth-grade math and
seventh-grade in English.
   Verity, who declined to identify the company, said, ``A test was
given to 480 people who applied, and only 49 of them passed.'' The
company offered to send those who flunked to an eight-week remedial
course at a community college, and 50 of the 100 people who took
the course passed the company's test on a second try.
   Verity said the real problem is that schools should be improved
so that all high school graduates ``at least have the equivalent of
a seventh-grade education in English and a fifth-grade education in
math, which is sort of the norm for getting a job in industry.
Hopefully, as time goes on, those levels will rise and we'll have a
much better workforce coming out of the school system.''
   ``The Bottom Line'' guidebook outlines how to identify
employees' basic skills and how to improve them. It spells out how
to conduct a ``literacy audit'' to determine what skills a worker
needs to carry out a given task, and offers suggestions of actual
programs that have proven successful.
   McLaughlin said 75 percent of the U.S. workforce for the year
2000 are already out of school. ``Many of these workers are
ill-prepared to deal with rapidly changing technology because they
lack adequate basic skills,'' she said. ``Clearly, business must
take a lead role in remedying the basic skills gap for these
workers.''
   She cited estimates that up to 23 million American adults lack
the basic skills needed to hold a job.
   Bennett said, ``Unfortunately, there are still too many people
who graduate from our high schools with a diploma, but without the
necessary skills.''
   ``Our job doesn't stop with the schools. And that's where this
book comes in,'' said Bennett.
   McLaughlin said it was ``an interesting liaison'' between the
three Cabinet officers. But noting that it was their first joint
appearance, she said, ``Maybe we're not quite getting the act
together.''
   Bennett quipped, ``It's our first, but not our last. Peter, Paul
and Mary, look out.''

<HEAD>Jackson Leans on Blue-Collar Workers for Wisconsin Primary Win</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he can win Wisconsin's
pivotal Democratic primary ``because I've stood here with the meat
packers in Cudahy, the auto workers in Kenosha and the paper
workers in De Pere.''
   From Iowa's bankrupt farmers to laid-off appliance workers in
Illinois, Jackson has stood side-by-side with the nation's
displaced and disaffected and in the process forged a winning
coalition.
   Jackson's campaign for ``economic justice'' has touched a chord
and it may be enough to deliver another victory over Michael
Dukakis in Wisconsin next Tuesday, aides to both candidates said
Monday.
   Support from blue-collar workers is crucial to Jackson's chances
in Wisconsin since Jackson's core black constituency makes up only
3 percent of the state's population. Jackson consistently carries
about 10 percent of the white vote, but has moved beyond that in
some states, notably in heavily-white Vermont earlier this month
and on Saturday in Michigan, where he won some predominantly white
areas on top of black Detroit wards.
   Tony Tsakakis, a national campaign aide to Massachusetts Gov.
Dukakis, said Wisconsin is a two-man race. Even though he feels
Dukakis will win, Tsakakis said he could not rule out a Jackson
victory.
   ``It's going to be the reverand and us through the convention,''
said Tsakakis.
   Bob Burns, a member of Jackson's national staff working in
Wisconsin, said Jackson would rely heavily on labor support in a
push to win Wisconsin.
   ``In every race where we have competed, we felt we would come in
No. 1 or No. 2 and Wisconsin is no different,'' Burns said.
   Both men referred to a Milwaukee Sentinel poll released Monday
that showed Dukakis leading Jackson 28 percent to 25 percent among
likely Democratic voters.
   The poll was conducted March 17-22, before Jackson's weekend win
in Michigan.
   ``It is not a measure of our new-found momentum as our
rock-bottom strength,'' Burns said.
   Even Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, a supporter of Vice
President George Bush, said Monday if he were a Democrat, he would
vote for Jackson.
   Under Wisconsin's open primary, Thompson legally could take a
Democratic ballot, but does not plan to do so.
   ``Just because he is a Democrat doesn't mean I can't like him,''
said Thompson, who joined Jackson earlier this month in Kenosha to
protest plans by Chrysler Corp. to close an auto plant there, a
move that will throw 5,500 people out of work.
   It is those auto workers in Kenosha, strikers at the Patrick
Cudahy meat packing plant in Cudahy and striking paper workers in
De Pere that Jackson is depending on to help him carry Wisconsin,
as he has done in other states.
   The day after Super Tuesday, Jackson was in the Chicago suburbs
of Cicero where workers were worried about the planned closing of a
General Electric plant thtat makes Hotpoint refrigerators. Jackson
was met under dreary, damp skies by a rally of about 200 people,
organized by the sheet metal workers union. They carried signs that
said, ``Jesse, help us save our jobs,'' and ``Unemployment, made by
GE.''
   Workers said they believed Jackson would make a difference for
them.
   ``Nothing has changed here. I've been working here 23 years. I
believe Jackson would make a change,'' said Mack Fundes.
   Phil Haney, a Kenosha auto worker who came to Milwaukee on
Saturday to see Jackson, said he felt the same way.
   ``He's been on the picket lines,'' Haney said.
   Haney said if Jackson were president, he would expect him to
push for legislation to promote more business investment at home
and help for workers displaced by plant closings and new
technologies.

   A father who gave up his life preserver to
save his son's life after their boat overturned and filled with
water in the swift Sandy River was still missing today and presumed
drowned.
   George Earl Trenkle, 40, of Blackfoot, Idaho, tossed a seat
cushion to his son, George Edward Trenkle, 18, after they and a
third man hit a log and were thrown from their boat into the frigid
water Saturday, Multnomah County sheriff's Deputy Bob Boertien said.
   The younger Trenkle said Sunday that he tried to throw the
cushion to his father after reaching safety, but he didn't have the
strength.
   ``I threw the thing to him, but I was so tired, it really didn't
go that far,'' Trenkle said.
   ``I could just see his head as he went around a bend,'' he
added. ``I yelled, `Dad!' a couple of times, and he said he would
be OK.''
   The third man in the boat, Roland Parkhurst, 40, of nearby
Gresham, was a paraplegic and was wearing a life jacket. Witnesses
pulled the younger Trenkle and Parkhurst from the river.
   The pair were taken to a hospital in Gresham, where they were
treated and released. The boat was found overturned and washed
ashore about a half-mile downstream from where it hit a submerged
log that almost destroyed its bow.
   A search for the elder Trenkle resumed late this morning.
   ``We were floating down river; my dad was rowing. We just got
started, and he was having trouble rowing. He was kind of new at
it,'' Trenkle said Sunday in a telephone interview with The
Oregonian newspaper from his uncle's house in Salem.
   After the boat overturned, Trenkle said he managed to climb on
top of it at one point. His father had hold of the boat, and
Parkhurst held his foot as they tried to make it to shore.
   ``Then we hit the rapids, and we all separated from the boat,''
Trenkle said.
   ``I was under water for quite a while.'' Then, he said, his
father pulled him up to the surface and gave him a seat cushion
that he had found.
   Trenkle, a high school senior, said his father worked as a fire
boss for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and was in Portland
for a business meeting. He said his father and Parkhurst had known
each other since high school.

<HEAD>Spy Suspects Seized in Setback to Soviet KGB</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in West Germany and Switzerland
seized 11 people suspected of spying for the Soviet Union in a
crackdown that was termed a major blow to the KGB, authorities said
Monday.
   Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann said the arrests showed
that Soviet bloc spy networks were redoubling undercover work in
the West, despite improved superpower relations.
   West Germany's counterintelligence agents ``have dealt a serious
blow to Eastern espionage agencies,'' Zimmermann said in a
statement.
   ``The large number of arrests confirms that instead of
refraining from activating agents in a time of political detente
(between East and West), the East bloc is intensifying the illegal
activities of its operatives,'' he added.
   Security sources said the arrests were made during a series of
police raids last week. Federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said they
marked ``an important penetration of the KGB spy network'' in West
Germany.
   An foreign engineer living in Zurich was arrested Wednesday on a
tip from West Germany, Swiss prosecutors said. They did not
disclose his name or nationality but said they had launched a
criminal investigation into his activities.
   Spy scandals and arrests are frequent in West Germany, a
front-line NATO ally and one of Western Europe's most
technologically advanced nations.
   In the last major espionage scandal, 15 communist agents were
arrested or disappeared between August and December 1985.
   Rebmann said 10 people were taken into custody Wednesday and
Thursday as part of a nationwide crackdown against espionage
targets. The raids were carried out by 169 police officers in 33
locations, according to Rebmann.
   He said six of the 10 taken into custody remained in jail on
Monday, and that investigations were continuing against the four
who were released.
   In addition, inquiries were under way against 14 other espionage
suspects, for a total of 24 separate investigations, the prosecutor
said. He declined to say how many of the cases were likely to
result in charges.
   He said those in custody included two teachers, three engineers
and a businessman, all of whom are suspected of working for the
KGB. Three were Soviet emigres living in West Germany.
   One suspect, businessman Helmut Stefan Kolasch, is believed to
have worked for the KGB since 1971, Rebmann said. Kolasch, 44,
allegedly gave the KGB technological secrets about NATO's Tornado
and Jaeger warplanes while working for firms dealing with the
aircraft, he said.
   Rebmann identified the other jailed suspects as Peter Friesen,
33, an engineer; George Bender, 37, also an engineer; Shimon Or,
48, a teacher; Edmund Neufert, 37, another teacher. Another
suspect, a Colombian engineer, was identified by Rebmann only as
``Amaya.''
   The prosecutor said all six were living in West Germany.
   Rebmann said Amaya also handed over unidentified technical
documents to the KGB; Friesen spied on West German political
parties, Bender reported to the KGB about a ``large electronics
concern'' he worked for, and Neufert spied on students while
teaching Russian at the Foreign Ministry's language-training office.
   Rebmann said Or ``reported (to the KGB) on his own life and
work,'' but he did not provide details.
   None of the suspected spies apparently knew one another and were
operating individually, the prosecutor told reporters.
   The police raids followed the March 18 arrest of a government
secretary who was also suspected of having worked for the KGB. Elke
Falk worked in several government ministries in the past decade and
had access to classified information.

   One of Amedeo Modigliani's last paintings sold for
a record $9 million Monday at an auction of Impressionist and
modern art.
   The oil painting, which set a record for the Italian artist,
portrayed Greek composer Marios Vavoglis and was completed in
January 1920, days before Modigliana died in Paris at age 36.
   An anonymous buyer purchased the simple painting, called
``Portrait of Mario,'' which had been put on the auction block by
an anonymous owner, Christie's said.
   It had been estimated to sell for $3.7 million to $4.65 million.
The previous record price for a Modigliani was $7.62 million, set
in November for a portrait called ``The Beautiful Roman.''
   Works by Pierre Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissaro, Alfred Sisley,
Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall and Joan
Miro, among others, were also for sale at the Christie's auction.

<HEAD>Broadway Producer Lee Guber Dead at 67</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Lee Guber, who helped bring Broadway
entertainment to theaters and concert halls throughout the country,
has died of brain cancer. He was 67.
   Guber, who died at his Manhattan home Sunday, produced nearly a
dozen shows on Broadway, including productions of ``The King and
I,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``I Do! I Do!'' and ``How
to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''
   He also headed a suburban entertainment chain that included the
Westbury Music Fair on Long Island, the Valley Forge Music Fair
outside Philadelphia, the Shady Grove Music Theater outside
Washington and the Painters Mill Music Fair in the suburbs of
Baltimore.
   Guber and his partner, Shelly Gross, booked such entertainers as
Judy Garland, Jack Benny, Sammy Davis Jr., Liberace and Stevie
Wonder. They also brought productions of Broadway musicals to
suburban theaters.
   Guber's last production, however, was one of several flops in
his career. ``Rags,'' a $5 million musical about immigrants, ran on
Broadway for only four performances before closing in August 1986.
   Guber was born in Philadelphia and met Gross at Central High
School there. With a third partner, Frank Ford, they began their
theatrical career in 1955 with productions at the Valley Forge
theater in Devon, Pa.
   Married three times, Guber divorced his second wife, broadcaster
Barbara Walters, in 1976 after a 13-year marriage.
   He is survived by his third wife, Lois Wyse, whom he married in
1982, as well as by three children from his prior marriages, two
stepchildren, a sister, a brother and eight grandchildren.
   Funeral services are planned Wednesday at Temple Emanu-El in
Manhattan.

<HEAD>Strikes, Disturbances Reported in Disputed Region in Caucasus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenians in a disputed region of the
Caucasus stayed away from factories and schools Monday to protest
the Kremlin's refusal to make the area part of the Armenian
republic.
   Groups of young men blocked pedestrians and busloads of workers
from reporting to their jobs in Stepanakert, the main city of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region, the government newspaper Izvestia
reported. It said authorities used mobile loudspeakers and leaflets
to urge an end to the strike.
   The state-controlled media said the ethnic unrest was damaging
the region's economy.
   About three-quarters of the 157,000 residents of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been part of neighboring Azerbaijan
since 1923, are ethnic Armenians.
   The official radio in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, said
``extremely fanatical elements'' incited disturbances Saturday
evening in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   It did not describe the disturbances or say exactly where they
occurred in the disputed territory. The British Broadcasting Corp.
monitored the broadcast in London.
   Sporadic strikes and protests have been reported in
Nagorno-Karabakh since Feb. 13. The latest labor trouble is said to
have begun Wednesday after Moscow refused Armenian demands to annex
the region, about the size of Delaware.
   In a telephone conversation, the manager of Stepanakert's only
hotel, the Karabakh, said all but essential services were halted.
   ``The bread and milk plants are working. The others are not.
Everyone is sitting at home,'' he said.
   About 30 percent of public transport was shut down in
Stepanakert, a city of about 33,000, The manager reported. He
described himself as an ethnic Armenian but would not give his name.
   An Izvestia dispatch from Stepanakert said workers stayed away
from factories producing silk, shoes and electronic goods, students
boycotted the teachers' college and mothers kept their children
home from kindergarten.
   Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaijan, also were
caught up in the trouble, it said.
   ``Ethnic Azeri workers arrived at the entrances to their
businesses but ... announced: Unless the Armenians come, we will
not work,'' Izvestia reported.
   Communist Party officials in Stepanakert called workers to
weekend meetings and urged them to resume their jobs, the
government paper said. Appeals distributed by leaflets and
broadcasts Monday said the city owed the government seven million
rubles ($11.2 million) in lost revenue.
   The hotel manager said party meetings continued Monday. He
predicted the strike would end Tuesday but Sergei Grigoryants, a
Moscow human rights activist who is half Armenian, said it was
scheduled to run through Friday.
   Pravda, the national party daily, said Monday the ``difficult
state of affairs'' in Nagorno-Karabakh had damaged the economy of
Azerbaijan as a whole.
   Losses to the automotive and transport industries were the
equivalent of about $2.4 million in February and March, and the
railway industry lost about $120,000, the paper said.
   It revealed little about how the money was lost but quoted a
railway official in Azerbaijan as saying freight cars had not been
unloaded. The official, Garik Sarkisyan, said the situation was
``thoroughly bad'' and ``loss of time and money has become the
usual thing.''
   There were no strikes or protests Monday in Yerevan, capital of
Armenia, according to an Armenian Interior Ministry official, a
hotel executive and Armenian nationalist Hovik Vassilian, all
interviewed by telephone.
   Izvestia said, however, that at least one Yerevan factory was
having trouble getting supplies from Sumgait, a city in Azerbaijan
on the Caspian Sea north of Baku where at least 32 people were
killed in ethnic riots Feb. 28.
   A van-assembly plant in Yerevan sent trucks to Sumgait for side
windows but were not allowed into the city. Izvestia said. It did
not make clear who barred the truck or why.
   Moscow dissidents in touch with Armenian sources over the
weekend described Yerevan as ``a dead city.'' People stayed home to
protest a crackdown on demonstrations that had been planned for
Saturday, they said.
   On Wednesday, the government announced a plan for improving
social and economic conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, but it does not
include annexation to Armenia.
   On Monday, Pravda said the improvements hinge on whether the
strike ends.
   ``Any most realistic and well-considered program cannot be
implemented if people do not come to feel a high personal
responsibility for the destiny and development of the area and do
not get down to work,'' it said. ``The machine tools should not
stay idle, railway cars should continue to be unloaded and field
work should go on.''

<HEAD>US `Regrets' Israeli Moves On West Bank and Gaza</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department criticized Israel on
Monday for sealing off the West Bank and Gaza for three days in
expectation of major demonstrations called by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``We regret the decision because of the impact it will have on
commerce, on visits with family members and the press,'' spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   Last Friday, the department advised U.S. citizens to avoid
travel to the areas because of continuing disturbances. This also
was likely to affect local business because tourists are attracted
to the West Bank during Holy Week.
   Israel's decision will keep Israelis and Arabs from entering the
territories. The only exceptions will be the 65,000 Jewish settlers
who live there among 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs.
   A total of 119 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have died
since violent protests broke out in the West Bank and Gaza on Dec.
9. Secretary of State George P. Shultz will launch a new drive in
Jerusalem on Sunday to hold negotiations for Palestinian self-rule
beginning May 1.
   He plans two stops in Israel and in Jordan, the two key
countries, and also stops in Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
Spokesman Redman said Shultz would like to meet with Palestinians
while he is in the region.
   On Tuesday, he is scheduled to meet here with representatives of
the Arab League, which is a group of the 21 Arab countries and the
PLO.
   Shultz will leave Washington on Thursday and spend more than two
days in Rome meeting with Italian officials and attending religious
services.
   Redman reaffirmed, meanwhile, that U.S. policy prohibits
``dealing'' with the PLO as well as negotiating or recognizing the
group until it accepts Israel's right to exist and disavows
terrorism.
   The spokesman said Shultz's meeting here Saturday with two
American members of the Palestine National Council did not conflict
with the 13-year-old policy, which also was written into law in
1984.
   The council considers itself the legislative arm of the
Palestinian nationalist movement. One of the two
Palestinian-Americans, Edward Said, said he informed PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat before he and Ibrahim Abu-Lughod met with Shultz, and
Arafat approved.
   Israel protested the meeting.
   Redman said the PLO and the council were not ``synonymous'' and
that ``our restrictions on dealing with the PLO remain as always.''
   The spokesman said Shultz's meeting with Said and Abu-Lughod,
who are university professors, was ``not a negotiating format.''
   Shultz presented his proposal for negotiations to Arab and
Israeli leaders four weeks ago and asked for a reply by mid-March.
So far, only Egypt has endorsed his plan.
   Still, Redman said the proposal was ``under serious and active
consideration by the parties.'' He said Shultz would emphasize the
plan was a fair and balanced approach to the 40-year Arab-Israeli
dispute.
   ``Nobody has said no,'' Redman said. ``We are going to continue
to work on this proposal to see if we can't get something going.''
   Asked about a report that Shultz would take with him an
invitation to a United Nations conference on the Middle East to
begin April 15, the spokesman said: ``It sounds pretty flaky.''

<HEAD>Helicopter Carrier To Pass Through Panama Canal</HEAD>

   The Pentagon, breaking its normal silence
about ship movements, said Monday the helicopter carrier USS
Okinawa would begin a transit of the Panama Canal on Tuesday.
   The Defense Department described the movement in a statement as
``routine'' and something ``which has been planned for several
months.''
   The Pentagon said the statement was issued in hopes of avoiding
rumors and speculation in Panama about the carrier's presence in
the waterway.
   The Reagan administration has been applying economic pressure in
hopes of ousting strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, but has made
clear it is not taking any military moves against the general.
   The Okinawa is steaming through the canal on the last leg of an
around-the-world journey that saw it deploy in the Persian Gulf to
support mine-sweeping operations. The carrier dropped off its
mine-sweeping helicopters earlier this month in Norfolk, Va., and
is now destined for its home port in San Diego.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his wife have decided on
a Los Angeles home to live in after the president leaves office in
January but will lease, rather than buy, the $2.5 million estate,
the White House said Monday.
   Elaine Crispen, press secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan, said
the Reagans signed a lease and mailed it within the last 10 days.
The estate in the luxurious Bel Air district is owned by Wall
Management Services, a group of about 20 friends of the Reagans who
bought it with them in mind.
   The three-year agreement gives the Reagans the option to renew
the lease or purchase the property. The estate includes 1\ acres of
grounds and a secluded house with 6,500 feet of living space and a
pool.
   Wall Management bought the estate on Aug. 21, 1986, from a
90-year-old woman who the investors said would lease it back from
them until the Reagans were ready for it.
   Mrs. Crispen said the previous owner has since died.
   The spokeswoman said she did not know the amount of the lease
payments. She said the lease agreement was worked out by the
Reagans' lawyers, the White House counsel's office and the Office
of Government Ethics.
   The Reagans' money is in a blind trust.
   The Reagans lived in Pacific Palisades, in the western part of
Los Angeles, before his election as president. That house has since
been sold.
   They own a century-old, Spanish-style adobe house of five rooms
and 1,500 square feet at Rancho del Cielo, their ranch on a
2,250-foot-high mountaintop 30 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.

<HEAD>Soviets Stepping Up Aerial Patrols Along Asian Coastline</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union has stepped up its aerial
reconnaissance patrols along the entire Asian coastline and is
becoming more aggressive in sending up fighters to meet American
patrol planes, the head of the U.S. Pacific Fleet said Monday.
   While it is difficult to know for sure, the increased activity
may reflect the aftermath of the Mathias Rust affair, in which a
West German teen-ager managed to fly a small plane past Soviet air
defenses to Moscow's Red Square, said Adm. David E. Jeremiah.
   Rust's success prompted a shake-up of the Soviet military
hierarchy.
   The four-star admiral, who took command of the Pacific Fleet
last October, also confirmed previous reports that the United
States would conduct naval exercises off the Korean peninsula
during this summer's Olympic Games.
   He also argued that Congress, in debating whether some older
Navy carriers should be retired soon, should not disturb the
current practice of basing a carrier in Japan. And he declared the
most important concern of military commanders in the Pacific to be
the situation in the Philippines and continued access to U.S. bases
there.
   The 54-year-old Jeremiah met for more than 45 minutes with
Pentagon reporters Monday to discuss developments within a military
theater that is by far the Navy's largest _ stretching from the
West coast to Africa.
   Jeremiah said the Soviets had become much more aggressive in
recent months in meeting U.S. aircraft over the Pacific,
particularly in scrambling MiG-23 jet fighters out of a base in Cam
Rahn Bay, Vietnam, and from Soviet bases above the Sea of Japan.
   ``I think you're seeing a pattern that reflects the Rust
incident,'' Jeremiah continued.
   ``That's what the reaction is. The Soviets (military) obviously
got jacked around pretty hard after that penetration of their air
space. The Soviet aviation forces ... have been much more
aggressive in reconnaissance flights around the Sea of Japan and
offshore off Japan, some of them over North Korea and down to Cam
Rahn Bay and into the South China Sea.
   ``The activity rate is higher than it was in times past,'' he
said.
   Addressing the large Russian naval base at Cam Rahn Bay,
Jeremiah said the Soviets did not appear to be engaged in any major
construction projects at the moment. But he added the base is now
substantially larger than when it was used by the United States
during the Vietnam war.
   The admiral refused to offer many details on U.S. plans for
naval exercises during the Summer Olympics, beyond saying the
aircraft carrier Midway and a battle group would maintain ``a
fairly continuous presence through the period.''
   Pentagon sources disclosed last month the exercises would be
staged to let North Korea know ``that we're watching them'' and
nothing should be done to disrupt the Olympic games in South Korea.
   Jeremiah described the Midway, the only U.S. aircraft carrier
based outside the United States, as an essential part of America's
forward defenses in that part of the world.
   While the Midway itself has become the object of proposed budget
cuts, it would ``absolutely'' have to be replaced with another
carrier, he said.
   ``If anything is done to change the composition of the carrier
force, then this country should be careful to do it in a prudent
way that allows us to get all of the pieces put together in
sequence so that we don't disturb relationships with our host
nations,'' Jeremiah added.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt quit the Democratic presidential race
today, a victim of mounting losses in the seven weeks since he won
the lead-off Iowa caucuses. Rival Jesse Jackson, on the rise with a
victory in Michigan, said he expects the party to embrace him as
its nominee if he wins the most pre-convention delegates.
   Gephardt, who declared his candidacy in February 1987 and
actually began campaigning more than a year earlier, said at a
Capitol Hill news conference, ``It's time to end a presidential
campaign.''
   He said he would file for re-election to his House seat on
Tuesday ``to continue my fight for the people whose concerns have
been at the heart of this campaign.''
   The Missouri congressman noted that it is often said that an
opera isn't over ``until the fat lady sings.'' Referring to his
distant third-place finish in the Michigan caucuses, he said,
``Last Saturday in Michigan, I think I heard her walking to the
microphone.''
   He ranked fourth among the Democratic contenders in delegates to
the national convention.
   On the eve of Tuesday's Connecticut primary, Vice President
George Bush, who grew up in that state and is heavily favored to
win, set off today on a three-day Wisconsin campaign swing.

   Bush's one-time foe, Jack Kemp, endorsed the vice president,
saying ``George Bush is going to be the nominee of the Republican
Party and he has earned that nomination.'' Kemp said the GOP must
rally around Bush to avoid a Democratic win in November, which he
said would lead to a decline ``every bit as steep and severe as
under Jimmy Carter.''

   Bush, the overwhelming GOP front-runner, wasn't likely to run
into either of his remaining rivals in Wisconsin, which holds its
primary a week from Tuesday. Bob Dole, who has all but conceded the
nomination, was in Washington today, giving a speech on the future
of the Republican Party. And Pat Robertson was taking a week-long
vacation.
   Jackson, on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said today, ``If
at the end of California, we have the most popular votes and the
most delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical and proper.''
   He questioned the idea that party leaders might ignore his
delegate strength at the convention and give the nomination to
another Democratic candidate.
   ``They would not have given me the nomination; I would have
earned it from the people,'' Jackson said. ``There is no small
group. No electoral college that can give. ... If so, why even have
a primary? Why not just let the small group choose candidates in
the first place?
   ``I don't believe in collecting a group of favorite sons, and
then selecting one, the people elect what's left,'' he said.
   Jackson said if he wins the nomination through the Democratic
process, ``I expect the party to embrace me and to embrace those
principles.''
   Rival Michael Dukakis was seeking to come back with a win on his
New England home turf. Jackson was campaigning in Connecticut again
today. But Dukakis, the governor of neighboring Massachusetts, has
won every state in New England so far and was expected to do well
in the state.
   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,
Jackson had 55 percent to 28 percent for Dukakis. Gephardt had 13
percent; Sen. Paul Simon had 2 percent, as did Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
The remaining returns were expected later today.
   The Michigan victory put Jackson within striking distance of
Dukakis in the national delegate count, although the Massachusetts
governor still clung to a narrow lead. The latest AP delegate count
put Dukakis at 603.55 to Jackson's 597.55. Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. had 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 171.5, Gephardt 167 and
uncommitted 362.6.
   Some of the Democratic candidates were gathering for a forum in
New York tonight. But Dukakis was not expected, and Gephardt might
not be a candidate by then.
   Dukakis, who before Michigan had been seeking to position
himself as the inevitable Democratic nominee, was talking instead
about a long fight to the finish.
   ``This race is only half over,'' he said Sunday at a Greek
festival in New Haven. ``Anyone that thinks that this race is over
or even that it's narrowed down to a two-person or a three-person
race doesn't understand the unpredictability of American politics.
... There are no front-runners.''
   That was fine by Gore and Simon. The Tennessee senator was in
Connecticut on Sunday, suggesting Dukakis' disappointing finish
kept the race ``wide open'' _ to his benefit.
   ``We're building momentum steadily. ... We're gaining speed,''
Gore said after a speech at an Italian-American club in the
industrial city of Derby. ``This race has a long way to go. It is
wide open, even more so after the results in Michigan.''
   Simon also suggested _ as he has for some time _ that the race
was still fluid, and no nominee would emerge before the Democratic
National Convention in July. The Illinois senator, who came away
with only 2 percent of the vote in Michigan, has said he needs a
strong showing in Wisconsin to carry on.
   A statewide poll in today's Milwaukee Sentinel suggested Jackson
and Dukakis were in a dead heat in the state.
   Another poll suggested Dukakis was the clear favorite in New
York, which holds its primary on April 19.
   The weekend wasn't a complete loss for Dukakis. He won precinct
caucuses in North Dakota, and he edged out Gephardt in Iowa's
county conventions, the latest step in that state's complicated
delegate-selection process.

   Police arrested 60 people Monday during a
demonstration in which protesters tried to force their way into the
Iraqi Embassy and hurled stones through the windows.
   The crowd was protesting Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons
in Kurdish regions in its 7{-year-old war with Iran.
   Interior Minister Karl Blecha met with the Iraqi ambassador,
Wahbi A. Razak al-Qaraguli, and expressed the government's regrets,
said Karl Newole, spokesman for the minister.
   Protesters and police said shots were fired when some in the
crowd tried to force their way into the embassy. Police spokesman
Martin Muellgassner said no one was injured.
   Muellgassner said it was not clear who fired or what kind of
weapon was used. He reported four to six shots, fired inside the
building.
   On Austrian radio, a protester who was not identified said an
embassy employee fired into the street with an automatic weapon.
   A statement from a group of Kurdish groups, carried by the
Austria Press Agency, protested the shooting. It said a delegation
of demonstrators had wanted to enter the embassy to protest ``the
massacre of Kurds in Iraq.''
   Iran accused Iran last week of dropping cyanide and mustard gas
bombs March 16 and 17 on three Kurdish towns in Iraq that killed
5,000 people and wounded 5,000. The towns had been captured in an
Iranian offensive.
   One of Monday's demonstrators told Austrian radio a delegation
of three or four people had wanted to present a protest to embassy
officials. The Kurdish statement said the shots were fired as the
delegation tried to enter the building.
   People gathered outside the embassy at 10:20 a.m. in a heavy
rain. Some carried posters saying, ``Stop The Massacre,'' or
``Freedom For Kurds.''
   Muellgassner said the crowd surged toward the embassy and five
to 10 people pushed through the door, but embassy personnel managed
to force them back. The four policemen regularly posted at the
embassy were outside, he said.
   Newole said the Iraqi ambassador asked Blecha for increased
protection and Blecha said an investigation would be conducted to
determine whether it was necessary.
   According to police, protesters threw stones through the windows
after the shots were fired. A demonstrator interviewed by Austrian
radio said the crowd began the protest ``with peaceful intentions.''
   Demonstrators said about 70 people took part, but some fled when
shots were fired.
   Some of the Kurds allegedly wounded in the Iraqi attacks were
expected in Vienna on Tuesday for medical treatment. They
originially were to have arrived Monday and there was no
explanation for the delay.

   Richard Gephardt, who fell short of the
``Michigan miracle'' he needed to revive his candidacy, quit the
race for the Democratic nomination today but said ``our effort was
not in vain.''
   Departing at an announcement on Capitol Hill, Gephardt continued
the populist, anti-establishment flavor that he used on the stump.
   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challenged
the Democratic Party and and called it back to its central role as
an agent of fundamental change,'' he said.
   Gephardt also updated the line that became the populist slogan
of his campaign, ``It's your fight too.''
   ``Whether the issue is trade or Social Security, Contra aid or
the environment, tax justice or corporate responsibility, your
fight will always be my fight too,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt's candidacy limped out of the South on Super Tuesday
three weeks ago, having never received the beneficial momentum he
had expected from Iowa.
   Gephardt had looked to Michigan's caucuses last Saturday,
figuring that auto-industry state would provide a most receptive
ear for his call for trade retaliation against countries that don't
open markets to U.S. products.
   He asked for a ``Michigan miracle.'' Instead he got a distant
third place finish behind Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
   ``It's been said the opera isn't over until the fat lady
sings,'' Gephardt said. ``Last Saturday in Michigan I think I heard
her walking to the microphone.''
   Gephardt's campaign blossomed in the lead-off delegate event,
Iowa's caucuses, where his tough talk on trade caught on with the
state's Democrats. He won again in South Dakota, but on Super
Tuesday he failed to win anywhere other than his home state of
Missouri.
   Gephardt said he would file for re-election to his House seat
from Missouri. ``I hope to carry their cause as a member of
Congress, and tomorrow I'm filing for re-election,'' he said.
   Aides said Gephardt did not intend to try to preserve the
delegates he had already won as a bloc by continuing his campaign
in a suspended state.
   He spent Sunday at home in seclusion at his suburban Virginia
with family and advisers. Aides were silent about what went on, but
as early as last week they had said privately that he would drop
out if he didn't make a strong showing in Michigan's Democratic
caucuses. He finished a distant third in Saturday's contest.
   Going into Michigan, Gephardt indicated it was a do-or-die state
for him, but said he believed his prospects were good. Michigan is
an industrial and union state that offered as receptive an audience
for his tough talk on trade as Gephardt was likely to find anywhere.
   Gephardt's last campaign speech was in Milwaukee, before
Wisconsin Democrats who vote next Tuesday. He delivered it as the
size of his Michigan defeat was becoming clear.
   ``All things considered, I'd rather be back in Des Moines,''
said Gephardt, who won Iowa's lead-off caucuses but was unable to
convert that into victories in other states aside from his own
Missouri and in South Dakota.
   Even in Iowa, Gephardt's candidacy was slipping away.
   At county conventions there over the weekend, follow-ups to the
precinct caucuses in February, Gephardt lost supporters to Dukakis,
and Jesse Jackson gained ground as well.
   ``I think people see that Gephardt is pretty much out of it,''
said Tom Mann, a state senator from Des Moines who backed Jackson.
   Gephardt had won 167 delegates through 31 contests, falling
behind even Sen. Paul Simon, who was not a factor on Super Tuesday
and only stayed in the race because he won his home state of
Illinois.
   His delegates, where people have actually been selected to fill
those slots, would become free to do as they wished if Gephardt
pulled out of the race. In states where no people had been selected
yet to fill delegate slots won by Gephardt, his delegate share
would be reallocated among the other candidates depending on state
rules.
   Gephardt surged to the top of the Democratic field in Iowa with
savvy television ads and a tough, pointed campaign message blaming
unfair trade practices for much of the nation's economic difficulty.
   But his win in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8 didn't provide the
``bounce'' that he hoped for in the states that followed.
   ``Gephardt got very little momentum out of Iowa,'' said
Democratic Party professional Elaine Kamarck. Pat Robertson's
surprise second-place finish over George Bush on the Republican
side dominated the news.
   Gephardt lost everywhere on Super Tuesday except for a
homes-state win in Missouri. He was pounded across the South in a
withering crossfire of negative television ads by both Dukakis and
Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   Gephardt delivered strongly stated populist, anti-establishment
themes. But his message had a fundamental negativism to it _ at
every speech he declared that America was ``in decline.''
   His depiction of himself as battling the establishment also
brought an undercutting skepticism from those who knew him as the
consummate Washington insider. Some critics called his message
``pseudo-populism.''
   When he tried to resuscitate his campaign in the Northern
industrial states, organized labor did not provide backing. A day
before Michigan's caucuses, he asked UAW members at a rally in
Flint to deliver a ``Michigan miracle.''
   But the UAW in Michigan was splintered, with many of the
rank-and-file members backing Jackson. When UAW president Owen
Bieber appeared with Gephardt two days before that state's
caucuses, his unwillingness to offer an endorsement underscored
Gephardt's problem.
   Gephardt formally declared his candidacy on Feb. 23, 1987, but
he had begun campaigning more than a year earlier.

   State and local governments increasingly are
considering whether men and women should be paid the same for jobs
that are different but of similar value to an employer, according
to a private study released Monday.
   The survey by the National Committee on Pay Equity said more
than 1,500 local governments, school districts and community
colleges have taken steps to identify or eliminate race or sex bias
in the wages of civil service employees.
   Cities, counties and school districts in 24 states and the
District of Columbia have taken some action to address the issue of
pay equity, the report said.
   ``Americans are rejecting compensation systems that unfairly
penalize women and people of color,'' Eileen M. Stein, chairwoman
of the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civil
rights groups, said in a statement accompanying the report.
   ``It is indisputable that pay equity is taking hold at the local
and state levels,'' she said. ``Employer by employer, jurisdiction
by jurisdiction, race and sex discrimination will be removed as
wage determinants.''
   Pay equity, also known as comparable worth, is the concept of
paying men and women similar wages for different jobs judged to be
of equal value to an employer. Supporters of the concept say action
is needed to offset historical discrimination that has depressed
wages in job fields dominated by women, such as teaching, nursing
and clerical work.
   Opponents say it is impossible to compare jobs as disparate as,
say, nursing and truck driving.
   Stein pointed to recent victories for pay equity proponents,
such as the $35 million decision by the city of San Francisco last
March to give 12,000 city and school employees raises of $750 to
$2,000 a year over two years.
   The city acted after its civil service commission found that
female and minority municipal workers were paid an average of 42
percent less than their male counterparts in similar jobs.
   The year before, Washington state adjusted the wages of about
35,000 state workers in a program that could cost about $482
million through 1992.
   Stein also said Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Colorado Springs,
Colo.; West Hartford, Conn.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Spokane, Wash.;
Sioux City, Iowa; Palo Alto, Calif.; Long Beach, Calif.; Green Bay,
Wis.; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Burlington, Vt., have made pay
equity adjustments.
   Pay equity proponents in Congress have been unsuccesful so far
in attempts to pass legislation requiring the government to study
its wage and job classification systems for possible discrimination.
   To date, no federal appeals court has ruled that employers must
pay similar salaries to workers in jobs of comparable worth
although some employers are undertaking such salary revisions on
their own.

   Graffiti will remain on the walls
of a synagogue through Passover as a reminder that anti-Jewish
attitudes remain widespread, a rabbi said.
   Some of the red scrawling at Temple Beth-El was partially erased
Sunday, but some will remain through the holiday, which begins
Friday and marks Jewish deliverance from slavery, said Rabbi Alan
Cohen.
   Meanwhile, police have assigned an investigator to the vandalism
at Temple Beth-El and Temple Beth David in Palm Beach Gardens, but
there were no leads and no arrests, Sgt. Michael Fulk said Monday.
The temples were defaced over the weekend.
   Acts of vandalism against Jews, their institutions and property
rose nationally in 1987 but declined in Florida and Palm Beach
County, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors
racist incidents. Sixteen anti-Semitic acts were reported in Palm
Beach County last year, down from 17 the year before.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a million workers halted
public transport and closed many businesses Monday in a 24-hour
general strike against a government labor proposal.
   The walkout also disrupted international flights, closed banks
and brought factories to a standstill. Union leaders said the
strike, aimed at a bill which they say would give employers too
much power to fire workers, was the country's biggest ever.
   Jose Torres Couto, head of the Socialist-led General Workers'
Union, said between 1.75 million and 2 million workers went on
strike. His union called the walkout.
   The Labor Ministry said the figures were exaggerated.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said most of the country went
to work as normal with the exception of the state-owned public
transport sector, where union militancy is high.
   The General Workers' Union is dominant among white-collar
workers. The Communist CGTP, stongest among blue-collar workers,
supported the strike, the first time it has backed industrial
action by the socialist union.
   Opposition parties do not have the strength to defeat the
government's labor bill in Parliament. But union leaders have
expressed the hope that President Mario Soares will veto it.
   Soares, whose election two years ago was strongly supported by
the unions, could use his veto to delay the legislation but could
not overturn it altogether. He has not said what he will do.
   However, the prime minister said Monday his Social Democrat
center-right government won't change a word of the bill.

<HEAD>Filibuster Continues on Bill Requiring Worker Notice of Toxics
Threat</HEAD>

   Supporters of a bill to warn as many as
300,000 workers a year that they risk cancer or other diseases from
job exposure to toxic chemicals failed Monday on a third attempt to
stop a Republican filibuster.
   Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
the chief sponsors of the union-sought legislation, mustered only
41 of the 60 votes needed to end debate and force a vote on the
measure itself.
   The bill is aimed at addressing what the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health estimates is one in every four
Americans who has been exposed to carcinogens at work, most of them
unaware of it.
   ``This bill is about people getting cancer in the workplace and
learning about it too late to do anything about it,'' Metzenbaum
said. ``The American Cancer Society estimates we can save 250,000
lives in the next 10 years by implementing it.''
   A fourth and possibly final attempt at ending the filibuster is
scheduled Tuesday. Supporters of the bill believe if they get
another 14 or 15 votes then, they can prevent Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., from giving up on the effort to win
its passage this year.
   A virtually identical measure was passed by the House on a
225-186 vote last November. Administration officials have said they
would urge President Reagan to veto if it reaches his desk.
   Although the filibuster primarily is the work of Republican
Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Dan Quayle of Indiana, a small group
of southern Democrats who want to avoid a showdown vote are helping
keep it alive.
   Metzenbaum and Kennedy were able to get just 33 votes last week
for ending the filibuster. At least one southern Democrat and a few
liberal Republicans who had voted with Hatch and Quayle last week
voted with Metzenbaum and Kennedy on Monday.
   The bill would establish a panel of seven scientific experts to
identify the most hazardous substances in workplaces and the groups
of employees most susceptible to disabling diseases because of
exposure to them.
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health would
be required to notify between 100,000 and 300,000 of those workers
every year at an annual cost of $25 million. Employers then would
be required to finance medical monitoring programs for them at a
cost of up to $250 each annually.
   If a physician recommends transferring a monitored employee to
less hazardous work, he or she would have to be paid the same level
of wages and benefits to them in the new job. If no other job is
available, the employee is entitled to full wages for up to a year
after leaving work.
   In addition to unions, the bill is supported by public health
groups, the chemical and electronic industries and several major
companies, most of which have instituted such notification programs
on their own.
   However, it is opposed by small businesses and large trade
associations such as the National Association of Manufacturers and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which claim the bill would expose
companies to liability suits from current and former employees.
   ``If this bill passes, there is going to be a liability crisis
in this country like we've never seen before,'' Hatch said.
``You're going to have billions and billions of dollars in
lawsuits.''

<HEAD>Nine City Councilmen Injured In Bomb Attack In The South</HEAD>

   Sinhalese extremists threw three bombs
into a city council building in the southern town of Matara on
Monday, injuring nine councilors, police said.
   A police statement issued in Colombo said the attack was
launched by youths riding motor cycles in Matara, about 88 miles
south of the capital.
   Nine council men were wounded, including four of them seriously,
the statement said. The victims belonged to different political
parties, including the governing United National Party.
   The attack was carried out by six members of the outlawed
Peoples' Liberation Front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group,
the statement said. The group has vowed to kill anyone who supports
an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed in July. The accord aimed
at ending the Tamil ethnic conflict.
   Sinhalese extremists claim the accord gives too many concessions
to the Tamils.
   The Peoples' Front has killed more than 220 people in the past
five months, according to official statements made last week. Many
of the victims have been members of the majority Sinhalese
community, who have supported the accord or not expressed
opposition to it.
   Meanwhile, residents in the eastern town of Batticaloa said in
telephone interviews that tension was increasing in the east after
Tamil youth looted and burned 25 Moslem-owned shops on Saturday in
Kalmunai. Most of the Moslem shops closed down after the arson
attacks.
   A Roman Catholic priest, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said: ``The whole area is very tense after the attack. Large
contingents of Indian troops backed by helicopters are all over the
place.''
   More than 50,000 Indian peacekeeing troops are in the eastern
and northern Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil militants who oppose the
peace pact. They have been battling the rebels since last October.
   Moslem leaders, including Moslem Religious Affairs Minister
Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed, have claimed that Indian troops were
responsible for the attack on the shops on Saturday.
   Sources in the government said that Mohamed and three other
Moslem lawmakers told the high-level National Security meeting that
Indian peacekeeping troops were involved.
   The attack took place after the troops had cordoned off the area
and imposed a curfew, the lawmakers told the meeting, according to
the sources.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, most
of whom are Sinhalese. Tamils say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese, who control the government and the military.
   Tamil militants are fighting for a separate homeland in the
Northern and Eastern Provinces where most of the Tamils live.

   Foreign visitors attracted by the weak dollar and
the slick ``Miami Vice'' image are producing double-digit increases
at southern Florida tourist attractions for the first time in years.
   ``It's like a language school outside my office,'' said Michael
Finley, superintendent of Everglades National Park. ``I'm hearing
French, German, Japanese everywhere.''
   A total of 306,202 visitors came to the park in January and
February, an increase of 43 percent from the 213,384 who came in
the same months last year.
   Lion Country Safari, the Palm Beach County big-game preserve and
amusement park, shows a 25 percent boost over last year.
   ``We were so busy over the Washington Birthday weekend, I stood
out all afternoon directing traffic,'' said Lion Country marketing
director Brian Osborne. ``We had a 4-mile-long line of traffic in
the park.''
   Ocean World, where Fort Lauderdale visitors can pet dolphins and
watch sharks feed, reports 18 percent more visitors this season.
   South Florida tourist officials are unable to estimate the total
number of foreign tourists, but international traffic at Miami
International Airport was 786,951 passengers in January, up 9
percent over January 1987's total.
   ``We're something different than they've got back home in Europe
and Japan,'' said Jerome Scherr, president of Miami's Parrot
Jungle, where attendance was up 16 percent from January to January.
``We're subtropical _ palm trees and glamour.''
   Nigel and Rosy Collins visited Miami's Seaquarium from London.
   ``Everything is so warm, so clean, so new, so cheap,'' Collins
said, as his wife chimed in, ``And you've got Don Johnson.''
   They expected their weeklong trip to South Florida and Orlando
to cost barely half of what they would have paid two years ago
because of the dollar's decline against foreign currencies.
   `You have a truly unique place,'' said Klaus Mueller, a German
who was bird watching at Everglades National Park. ``Everybody in
the world knows about the Everglades.''
   Businesses that thrive on tourism expect the boom to continue as
long as the dollar is low.
   ``The English should be here big in April,'' Scherr said. South
Americans will then travel north to avoid winter, and Europeans
will keep coming.
   Finley expects Europeans to generate 80 percent of the business
at Flamingo Lodge at the southern tip of the park in the
mosquito-swarming months of July and August.
   Meanwhile, the traditional spring break market that put Fort
Lauderdale on the map is in decline. Broward County tourism
officials had been expecting 200,000 vacationing collegians but
said Sunday they now expect only 110,000 to 180,000 _ the smallest
crowd this decade.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday she
sees no signs that President Reagan is becoming a lame duck.
   The British leader told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a
radio interview that the president is ``cantering up to a very
strong finish.''
   ``I mean, there's no sign of slowing down at all. If anything,
it's a very, very strong finish,'' she said.
   Asked whether she will consider herself leader of the Western
world while a new U.S. president settles in, Mrs. Thatcher said
there ``can be no substitute for American leadership _ there just
can't.''
   ``They're strong, they're enterprising, they somehow keep that
country going through difficulties with elections,'' she said.

   Jesse Jackson poked fun at his
better-financed Democratic presidential rivals on Monday and urged
voters to catch the ``fever of hope'' and join his own rising White
House campaign.
   Jackson, who scored a landslide victory over Michael Dukakis in
the Michigan caucuses on Saturday, is far behind in the polls in
advance of Tuesday's contest in Connecticut.
   But he is in a neck-and-neck race with Dukakis in The Associated
Press national delegate count, and has received more votes in the
primary contests to date than any of his rivals.
   He said his campaign lacks the financial ``big boulders'' that
some of his opponents can claim.
   ``I have little rocks,'' he said. ``But I throw them straight.''
   ``We have the most gold and silver medals'' in the primaries and
caucuses so far, Jackson proclaimed. ``We can win.''
   He said his campaign has a ``small budget, a strong message and
a clear vision.''
   Jackson began his day by making it clear that he expects the
party to nominate him if he winds up the primary season with the
most delegates and the most votes.
   ``Becoming the nominee is logical and proper'' if he achieves
those goals, he said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.''
   He questioned the idea that party leaders _ many of whom view
him as a sure loser in a general election campaign _ might turn to
another contender.
   ``They would not have given me the nomination. I would have
earned it from the people,'' he said.
   ``I don't believe in collecting a group of favorite sons, and
then selecting one, the people elect what's left,'' he added.
   Jackson did not address the issue of Democratic Party acceptance
as he closed out his low-budget, high-energy Connecticut campaign.
   But in stops in Middletown, at a crime and drug-ridden area of
Waterbury and a well-attended outdoor rally in Hartford, he managed
to ridicule better-financed opponents.
   ``We don't have no Rolls Royces and no big stretch limousines on
the road to the White House. We're walking but we know the road
better,'' he said.
   In another jab, he said, ``we're not getting endorsements from
the top down. We're getting votes from the bottom up.''
   Jackson stressed his message that the powerless can gain power
if they have hope.
   He said people in wheelchairs, the homeless and others who come
to hear him ``have the fever of hope.''
   ``There's nothing more powerful in the world than the people
whose hope has been raised.''
   In his stop in The Mt. Olive Church of God and Christ in
Waterbury, Jackson drew his loudest cheers when he condemned drug
use. ``We the people must say down with dope and up with hope,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Number of Power Plant Accidents About Unchanged, Critics Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's commercial nuclear power plants
reported 2,810 accidents in 1987, about the same number as for a
slightly smaller number of plants the previous year, a group
critical of the industry said Monday.
   The corresponding figure for 1986 was 2,836. At the end of last
year, there were 105 nuclear plants in commercial operation against
99 at the same point a year earlier.
   The report was issued by the Critical Mass Energy Project of
Public Citizen, a group founded with the help of Ralph Nader. The
project publishes a compilation of Nuclear Regulatory Commission
reports annually, this year on the ninth anniversary of the
accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.
   ``The findings of this study suggest that the lesson of Three
Mile Island has been forgotten by the nuclear industry and its
friendly watchdog,'' the NRC, said Kenneth Boley, one of the
authors of the report.
   The report said 1987 figures could rise slightly as additional
reports come in from the plants.
   The commission imposed fines against utilities in 46 instances,
compared with 50 in 1986.
   The report said notable events of 1987 included:
   _The closure of the Peach Bottom plant of Philadelphia Electric
Co. for regular sleeping on duty by plant operators in a management
culture that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an industry
group, called ``an embarrassment to the utility and the nation.''
   _The NRC's proposal of an $80,000 fine for a supervisor's
instruction to tie two valves open in violation of regulations at
the Oyster Creek plant of Jersey Central Power & Light Co.
   _The firing of five employees by Detroit Edison Co. for their
involvement in an incident in which a trainee operator failed to
notify his supervisor for two hours when reactor water temperature
reached a certain point.
   Scott Peters of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a
pro-nuclear trade group, said he had not seen this year's report
but, ``If it's anything like past years it just distorts numbers to
make the situation seem worse than it really is.''
   Peters said industry performance improved by several measures.
   He said reactors were available to generate power 61.8 percent
of the time last year, compared with 60.3 percent in 1986;
unplanned automatic shutdowns fell from 3.9 per reactor to 2.7;
unplanned activation of other safety systems fell from 1.2 per
reactor to 0.9; and average radiation exposure per employee fell
from 622 millirems at boiling water reactors to 521 and from 397
millirems at pressurized water reactors to 368.
   A chest X-ray may be as much as 25 millirems and typical
background exposure in the United States is about 100 millrems per
year. The NRC permits civilian reactor employees to be exposed to
5,000 millirems per year.
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingraham declined comment because he said
the Criticam Mass report had not reached the commission.

   Mayor Carroll Thomas said Monday he will
try to resolve squabbling between two groups of rescuers by
appointing a citizens' committee to review proposals for a
television movie about Jessica McClure's rescue from an abandoned
well.
   The rescuers formed two associations, one of mostly municipal
workers and another of volunteers, to negotiate rights to the
dramatic story of the toddler's rescue after 58 hours in the well
last fall.
   ``The other two committees have indicated that they will yield
to (the citizens' committee's) decision,'' Thomas said. ``Both
groups have been saying they want what's best for the community.''
   Thomas said he hoped to established the five-member committee in
the next few days.
   One group, of more than 30 volunteers, is committed to a movie
deal with Los Angeles producer Larry Spivey, president of Highland
Communications Group Inc. Kragg Robinson, that association's
president, said members have signed a contract for an initial
$200,000 plus future payments to be divided among the members.
   The competing 11-member group has not made a deal with a
producer, but says it doesn't want to work with Spivey.
   Spivey said Monday he would talk to the citizens' panel about
his contract with the volunteers, but added that the group was not
released from its commitment.
   Thomas said the citizens' committee would not give Spivey's
plans preference over other proposals.
   Jessica turned 2 years old on Saturday.
   Her family's attorney, Darrell Smith, said the family won't
stand in the way of a movie being made, but the girl's parents have
not taken sides in the dispute.

<HEAD>Israel Hands Over Classified Documents To Independent Counsel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has handed over classified documents to
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh for his Iran-Contra
investigation under a cooperation agreement reached after year-long
negotiations, an Israeli official said Monday.
   In return, Walsh apparently agreed to revoke the subpoenas he
issued to four Israelis who arranged the 1985 and 1986 shipment of
U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran, the
official and a U.S. lawyer indicated.
   ``He will get what he wants without us having to give up what we
wanted,'' said the Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Melvin Rishe, a lawyer representing the Israeli government, said
``we have reached terms of how we would proceed, making litigation
unnecessary.''
   Israel's government wanted the subpoenas dropped, contending
that all four Israelis were acting under its orders and thus were
immune from prosecution and questioning by U.S. officials.
   The agreement with Walsh is ``on a government-to-government''
basis, according to Israeli embassy spokesman Yossi Gal, which
means any questions for the four must be channeled through official
Israeli representatives.
   Walsh and the Israeli Embassy issued brief statements announcing
the cooperation agreement, but said the contents will remain
classified.
   ``The government of the state of Israel and the office of the
independent counsel have signed an agreement covering the
cooperation of the government of Israel in the Iran-Contra
investigation,'' Walsh said in a prepared statement.
   ``Independent counsel Walsh expressed satisfaction with the
agreement and said his office looks forward to continued
cooperation with the state of Israel,'' the statement said. The
Israeli statement was almost identical.
   The documents handed over to Walsh include detailed financial
and historical chronologies prepared by Israel for the
congressional Iran-Contra committees last summer, said the Israeli
official.
   When Israel gave the chronologies to Congress, it stipulated
that Walsh be denied access to the documents because of his refusal
to grant immunity to the four Israelis.
   Along with the documents, Walsh has also been given written
answers to the questions posed last year by the congressional
investigators with regard to the chronologies, the official said.
   The documents are expected to help Walsh answer some of his
questions about Israel's Swiss bank account, which handled the
funds for the shipments to Iran.
   Walsh wanted the information to help him corroborate his case
against former White House aides Oliver North and John Poindexter,
as well as businessmen Richard Secord and his partner Albert Hakim.
All four have been indicted on charges of defrauding the U.S.
government through the arms sales and the diversion of profits to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Last year, Walsh subpoenaed Israeli businessmen Yaakov Nimrodi
and Al Schwimmer, as well as former foreign ministry director David
Kimche and government counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir. Nir
resigned from his post last week.
   The agreement was finalized 10 days ago by two senior government
representatives who held talks in Washington with Walsh and his
staff. The Israeli government approved the accord, the Israeli
official said.
   ``The negotiations were difficult,'' said Walsh spokesman Jim
Wieghart. ``Israel is a sovereign state with certain national
security interests, which they have to defend. We recognized that,
but on the other hand, we had our needs in this investigation,'' he
said.

   Biddy Mason, a former slave who became a
wealthy landowner and co-founder of the city's first black church,
won recognition from civic officials 97 years after her death.
   ``She is an example of the courage of black women in the early
days of this city,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said during a Palm Sunday
service at Mrs. Mason's gravesite. ``Our young people need to know
about her.''
   The philanthropist, who helped found the First African Methodist
Episcopal Church and the city's first elementary school for black
children, was buried in an unmarked grave and nearly forgotten
after her death in 1891.
   Bradley and about 3,000 members of the church unveiled a
tombstone hailing Mrs. Mason as a humanitarian.
   Mrs. Mason was born a slave in Mississippi in 1818 and, with her
three daughters, became the property of a Mormon family that moved
to Utah. She and her family later walked to California, where she
won her freedom in 1856.
   A midwife by trade, Mrs. Mason accumulated vast amounts of land,
often as payment from clients.
   ``When I was going through school, we never talked about
Biddy,'' said Linda Cox, a Mason descendant. But her 9-year-old
daughter, Cheryl, came home from school one day recently and said:
``Mommy, part of our family is in the history books,'' Mrs. Cox
said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction, with the rates on
three-month bills declining while rates on six-month bills
increased.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.69 percent, down from 5.76 percent
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.0 percent, up from 5.96 percent last
week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the lowest since they
averaged 5.65 percent on March 14. The six-month rate was the
highest since these bills averaged 6.03 percent on Feb. 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.85 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,856.20 and 6.27 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,696.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.77 percent last
week from 6.63 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday in the
political extortion trial of Sam Steiger, an ex-congressman and
former aide to Gov. Evan Mecham.
   Steiger, 59, was charged last fall with one count of theft by
extortion, accused of trying to influence the vote of a member of
the state Board of Pardons and Paroles.
   Judge Ronald S. Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court told
prospective jurors that the trial probably would last until
mid-April.
   Steiger is accused of having told parole board member Ronald D.
Johnson in an Oct. 1 telephone conversation that unless he voted
against a motion that day seeking the resignation of parole board
executive director Patricia Costello, he would lose his position on
the parole board or as a part-time justice of the peace.
   Johnson voted with three other board members to oust Ms.
Costello, who had Steiger's and Mecham's backing, and she stepped
down that day.
   The next day, Steiger allegedly sent Johnson a letter saying
Johnson's permission to serve as a part-time justice of the peace
was revoked and also that he could be fired from the parole board
if he defied the order.
   A key to the prosecution's case will be three tape recordings of
telephone converstations with Steiger. Reinstein ruled last week
that prosecutor Michael Cudahy, an assistant state attorney
general, could use the tapes.
   Defense attorney Thomas Karas had argued against their
admissibility, saying that they were secretly taped in calls to
Steiger at his home in Prescott and therefore violated his privacy.
   Steiger, who was paid more than $77,000 a year as a special
assistant to Mecham until his resignation Nov. 9, faces two to five
years in prison if convicted of the class four felony.
   Until he resigned about a month after his October indictment, he
served as one of several top aides to Mecham, who took office in
January 1987.

   An angry and bitter William Stern
testified Monday that Baby M should be kept from her biological
mother for several years to protect the child from emotional harm
and exploitation.
   Stern, testifying in what is expected to be the final legal
chapter of the 2-year-old dispute, characterized surrogate mother
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould as untrustworthy and capable of
undermining his relationship with the child, legally known as
Melissa Stern.
   ``Mary Beth will do anything and say anything to get her way,''
Stern said in 2{ hours of emotional testimony that ended with him
crying.
   The hearing, expected to last several days, was ordered by the
New Jersey Supreme Court in its landmark Feb. 3 decision that
declared surrogacy-for-pay illegal and restored Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's parental rights, but left intact a judge's order
awarding custody of the child to the Sterns.
   Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, of Tenafly, decided to have a
child through a surrogate mother because they feared Mrs. Stern,
42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, would
suffer complications during pregnancy.
   Mrs. Stern testified the possibility of both sides cooperating
in the future was remote.
   ``We don't share common values with Mary Beth, we don't think
about things in the same way and we don't react to situations in
the same way,'' Mrs. Stern testified. ``We are poles apart.''
   The Sterns are seeking to cut off contact between Melissa and
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, perhaps until the child's 10th birthday. Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould now visits the child once a week for two hours
under supervision at a children's social services center.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is seeking two, eight-hour weekly visits at
her home, later expanded to include weekends, half the summer and
some holidays. She was accompanied to court by her second husband,
Wall Street accountant Dean Gould, with whom she is expecting a
child.
   The Sterns agreed to pay $10,000 to Mrs. Whitehead-Gould to bear
them a child and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was artificially inseminated
with Stern's sperm.
   After the baby was born _ she turned 2 on Sunday _ Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould changed her mind and refused to surrender the child.
   In testimony Monday, Stern said Melissa should be protected,
likening her to a sapling that needs to secure its roots.
   ``If anything is done to interrupt those roots, I'm afraid
Melissa does not have much of a future,'' said Stern, a biochemist.
   He said that immediate contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould could
``force Melissa into the situation where she would have to choose
between us.''
   Stern said he and his wife have formed a warm, loving
relationship with Melissa. And his wife testified, `To precious
little Melissa, I know I'm her mother.''
   Under two hours of cross-examination by Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
attorney, Joel Siegal, Stern said he feared she would exploit the
child by writing a book that could lead to a photo of Melissa on
the book jacket, a film, a videocassette and even a promotional
tour for the book.
   But Stern acknowledged that Melissa does not seem to have been
harmed so far by her contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.
   His testimony ended with questions from the judge on what
religion the child would be exposed to. Stern, who is Jewish and
whose relatives other than his parents all died in the Holocaust,
broke into tears. He drank a cup of water and composed himself,
saying he expected to expose the child to a Unitarian church. Mrs.
Stern is not Jewish.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration on Monday
tested 75 headquarters employees for drugs, marking the start of
random drug testing procedures covering all 5,000 of the agency's
workers.
   The DEA has been testing agent trainees for drugs since June
1986.
   The agency has 2,800 agents and 2,200 support personnel.
   Agents found to be using drugs illegally will be dismissed.
Non-agents in less sensitive positions may face suspension or
reprimands for first-time offenses, said DEA deputy administrator
Thomas C. Kelly.
   The agency's Office of Professional Responsibility will conduct
inquiries when test results suggest show drug use.
   All 650 tests administered to the agency's trainees since
mid-1986 have failed to turn up any evidence of illegal drug use.

   President Reagan said Monday the American
public won't accept trade restrictions and retaliation against
foreign manufacturers.
   Reagan, promoting his free-trade stance even in the face of
mounting U.S. trade imbalances, warned that a trade bill under
consideration in Congress could weaken international trading
systems and ``require the president to start trade wars.''
   ``I'll veto if I must,'' Reagan told Reynolds Metals Co. workers
on the eve of a crucial House-Senate conference committee meeting
on the bill.
   Reagan long has advocated a policy of free trade and fair trade.
At the same time, he has resisted protectionist legislation, even
as the merchandise trade deficit climbed to a record $171.22
billion in 1987.
   But in his remarks Monday, Reagan said the legislation pending
in Congress would destroy progress that U.S. companies like
Reynolds have made.
   ``The reality is that manufacturing exports are surging and
manufacturing productivity is at an all-time high, and rising
rapidly,'' Reagan said.
   ``They've got a trade bill before Congress that could squelch
productivity, destroy American competitiveness and make all their
doomsday myths a reality,'' he said, noting that his critics have
been ``predicting economic disaster,'' although the economy is in
the 64th month of recovery from the recession of 1981-82.
   ``I think the American people have decided that one Great
Depression is enough, and they aren't going to give the trade
demagogues a second chance,'' Reagan said.
   ``Protectionism isn't just bad economics _ it's bad politics,''
the president said.
   He pointed to the March 8 Super Tuesday presidential delegate
selection contests and said ``those who had predicted that
protectionism would be embraced in the South were proven wrong.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who did poorly in the March 8
delegate selection contests throughout the South, had made the
nation's trade woes an important part of his campaign. Gephardt
announced Monday he was ending his bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   A half-dozen demonstrators protesting U.S. policy in Central
America greeted Reagan outside the Reynolds plant. When he arrived
in the plant's parking lot, he was cheered by several hundred
employees and family members, many of whom waved small American
flags.
   During his tour of the facility, the president walked past huge
rolls of aluminum, bound up in spools like thread. At one point, he
put on safety glasses and sat down at a console that operated an
aluminum processing machine by remote control.
   Reynolds is the world's leading producer of aluminum foil and
foil packaging. The company, which operates 55 plants in this
country and has operations in 18 others, also has experimented in
new products, such as a resealable can that retains carbonation.
   Reagan told a group of workers: ``You're performing miracles.
You make me proud.''
   During a forum that Reagan attended, William O. Bourke,
Reynolds' president and chief executive officer, told the
president, ``The time has come for the United States to announce to
everyone: Ladies and gentlemen, we are back in the export
business.''
   The president also attended a $2,500-a-couple GOP fund-raiser at
a surburban hotel. Michael Salster, a party spokesman, said the
president's appearance would add more than $50,000 for the party's
coffers.
   Reagan's visit took place as a House-Senate conference committee
prepared to meet Tuesday to work out compromises in their widely
varying versions of a 1,000-page trade bill.
   Reagan objects to many provisions in the trade bill, including
an amendment named for Gephardt that would require the president to
reduce ``excess and unwarranted'' surpluses run up by Japan and a
few other countries in trade with the United States. If
negotiations failed, the president would be required to use import
curbs to lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate.
   The president could waive such action if he found it contrary to
the national economic interest or if the offending country were
wrestling with serious debt. But critics say the plan is a long
step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against U.S.
industries.
   In his speech, Reagan said the bill's mandatory retaliation
provisions could ``require me and future presidents to take actions
that would be in direct violation'' of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trades.
   ``You may have been reading lately that the trade bill is making
good progress _ that a lot of protectionist provisions have been
jettisoned,'' he said. ``And there is some truth to that. But
there's a long way to go before the legislation does more good than
harm to the U.S. economy.''
   ``Only wholesale elimination of the objectionable provisions
will produce a bill I can sign,'' the president said. ``I won't let
them destroy the American growth economy. But I'd rather work with
Congress to bring about not just an `acceptable' bill, but one that
genuinely improves our current law.''
   Reagan made no mention of the United States' status as the
world's largest debtor nation _ it was the world's largest creditor
when he took office _ and instead pointed to figures showing last
year's gross national product growth as being 4 percent.
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in 1987 totaled $171.22
billion, a record. The trade deficit was $12.44 billion in January.
   The January report represented a slight setback after two
consecutive monthly improvements and reclaimed some of the gains
won from surging exports at the end of 1987.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and soldiers using shotguns,
rubber truncheons and tear gas broke up a march Monday by thousands
of opponents of Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Meanwhile, a general strike that has closed down an estimated 90
percent of Panama's industry and commerce entered its second week.
   Ignoring an order to disperse, a crowd of more than 10,000
cheering people began walking toward the capital's central business
district Monday afternoon.
   Minutes later, a tanker truck equipped with a turret over the
cab sped through the line of march, spraying hundreds of people
with a choking mixture of water and chemicals that sent them
fleeing into side streets.
   Behind the truck charged police and soldiers firing birdshot and
beating people with 18-inch-long rubber truncheons.
   As people fled the scene in panic, they left Central Avenue
littered with their shoes. Reporters saw at least two people
trampled in the rush, including a woman who suffered a compound leg
fracture.
   Before the march began, Lt. Col. Virgilio Mirones of the Panama
Defense Forces urged the protesters to disperse.
   ``We don't want to fight with the Panamanian people,'' the
officer said through a megaphone. ``We want to fight the United
States.''
   But the swelling crowd jeered at him, shouting, ``Join us, join
us'' and ``Noriega must go.''
   The United States has called for Noriega's ouster since he was
indicted in Florida in February on drug-trafficking charges. The
Defense Forces chief has said he is innocent.
   The Reagan administration has also imposed a number of economic
sanctions on Panama and supported efforts by former President Eric
Arturo Delvalle to freeze Panama's deposits in U.S. banks.
   Monday's demonstration was one of the largest in months. Like
others, it was smashed with drill-like precision. An hour after it
ended, squads of soldiers had occupied every major intersection and
most streets in the city.
   The mayors of Panama City and one of its largest, poorer suburbs
had warned protesters not to violate a ban on demonstrations that
``subvert public order.''
   In a communique published in state-run newspapers on Monday, the
mayors said the ban imposed Oct. 19, 1987 was still in effect.
   The papers also carried a statement from the principal
pro-government political party calling for a protest rally in front
of the U.S. Embassy later Monday.
   ``The rule seems to apply to one (protest) but not the other,''
said Jose Faundes, the secretary of the Panamanian Human Rights
Commission.
   Since the last major demonstration on March 16, soldiers in full
combat gear have patrolled the streets.
   The cash-short government issued checks Monday to its
lowest-paid retired public servants living in Panama City and
Colon, those whose semi-monthly pension benefits come to $150 or
less.
   Those living in other cities and retirees whose benefits total
more than $150 every two weeks were told they would be paid later
in the week.
   Many, however, were skeptical, noting that government offices
normally closed during the end of Holy Week. Even some who got paid
were less than happy.
   ``Things in Panama are not good,'' said Mariela Sanchez, a
former government secretary who received her full $36 pension
check. ``We have some money today, but what about next time?''
   An estimated 55,000 people normally receive government pensions,
but there was no official estimate of how many got paid Monday.
   The 15,000 members of Panama's Defense Forces did not receive
their wages last week and the government apparently doesn't have
the cash to meet a $33 million payroll for some 130,000 civilian
workers later this week.
   The government earlier had indicated it would make at least
partial payments to all of its retirees, but that plan apparently
was put aside.
   Banks were closed on March 3 after a run on deposits triggered
by the dismissal of Delvalle by the National Assembly, dominated by
Noriega supporters.
   Attorneys for Delvalle, who still is recognized by the Reagan
administration as Panama's president, managed to freeze millions of
dollars in government funds on deposit in U.S. banks.
   The civilian chief of state hand-picked by Noriega, Manuel Solis
Palma, told delegates at a ``Solidarity with Panama'' conference
Monday that Washington's actions constituted a ``total, brutal and
shameless aggression.''
   ``This treacherous attack is not only an attack on our country,
but on all the small and humble countries of the world,'' Solis
Palma told the representatives of populist or leftist political
parties from about 20 nations.

<TEXT>
   Wyatt Earp is causing a ruckus in his
hometown six decades after his death, as politicians and
descendants of the legendary lawman quarrel over where he was born.
   Small-town politics is fueling the dispute, with both sides
lining up support from elderly cousins of Earp, a survivor of the
1881 gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
   ``This is a political vendetta against me,'' said Robert Matson,
a former city council member whose successor has contested the
pedigree of a house Matson and his wife, Melba, own and operate as
the Wyatt Earp birthplace and museum in this town of 10,700.
   Shortly after George Morris, 45, took over Matson's council seat
earlier this year, he spearheaded a move to change the site's
billing.
   The sign that proclaimed the house Earp's birthplace was ordered
changed to simply say, ``Wyatt Earp Museum.''
   ``I think it's a super idea to promote a Wyatt Earp museum,''
Morris said. ``But I don't want to see history passed down that's
wrong. I consider myself a historian and I've researched it along
with some other people and we can shoot too many holes in the
Matsons' theory.''
   Matson, a 61-year-old school teacher, contends the move to
discredit the building's history was prompted by less-than-pure
motives.
   ``George Morris is a former sixth-grade student of mine. He's
got a house on the National Historic Register and maybe he doesn't
want us to get ours on it. Why he's led such an active opposition
to us is mysterious to me.''
   Morris dismisses the accusation, saying he has ``no reason to
have any grudges against the Matsons.''
   Neither side has positive proof.
   There are no county records, photos or deeds to pinpoint the
spot where Virginia Earp gave birth to her fourth child, Wyatt, on
March 19, 1848.
   The Matsons have lined up several Earp cousins to defend their
claim that Earp was born in the small, two-story frame house they
bought for $4,000 in 1986 in this wind-blown prairie town, 16 miles
east of the Mississippi River and about 190 miles north of St.
Louis.
   Morris has countered with Earps of his own, as well as a
Monmouth College professor and a local newspaperman. His side
contends the Matsons' house didn't exist at the time of Earp's
birth, and that he was born either in the family homestead nearly a
mile away or in a different house a couple blocks away.
   Effie Earp Cramer, 81, one of the Matsons' supporters, blames
the controversy on a reporter who was preparing a story on the
Matson house as the Earp birthplace in 1956. When he got scooped by
a rival, she says, he wrote a story saying the birthplace was two
blocks away.
   But Weldon Earp, 76, said he's ``seen research that shows the
house where Wyatt was born was moved from its original location two
or three times.''
   Earp was a peace officer in the Wild West. In 1879, he went to
the booming silver camp in Tombstone, Ariz., and became a deputy
sheriff of Pima County. Later, he served as a deputy U.S. marshal
and rode stagecoaches to guard express shipments.
   In 1881, he and two of his brothers took part in the famous
battle of the O.K. Corral against the Clanton gang.

   Thousands of meter readers, cashiers
and other utility employees are looking out for the welfare of many
of Illinois' 1.8 million senior citizens by volunteering in a
program called ``Gatekeeper.''
   ``Many are isolated and there's no support system around to
notice if they are having problems. Gatekeepers can link them into
the aging network,'' said Jeanne Blackman, consumer advocate at the
Department of Aging, which runs the community-service program.
   The backbone of the system is utility-company workers _
cashiers, customer service representatives, maintenance crews and
meter readers.
   ``We teach them how to recognize signs that an older person
needs help and give them the telephone numbers to make anonymous
calls to local agencies or the state Department of Aging,'' said
department spokeswoman Jan Costello.
   The result?
   When an Illinois Power Co. worker noticed rags were being used
to plug holes in the windows of a Madison County home, he alerted
social workers.
   The residents were provided with a heater and blankets, with
follow-up under a weatherization program.
   Bill McPherrin of Galesburg, a 22-year IP veteran, became an
active gatekeeper the first day he learned of the program.
   ``I thought there was a terrific need for it. We're in people's
homes and we see all types of living conditions,'' McPherrin said.
   Illinois Power, Northern Illlinois Gas Co., Central Illinois
Public Service Co. and several rural electric cooperatives
participate in the program, and more than 6,000 utility workers
have been trained to notice signs of trouble.
   ``We feel it has worked exceptionally well,'' Ms. Costello said.
``It's an easy program to operate and very cost-effective.''
   State officials have asked Illinois Bell and Springfield's
municipally owned utility to participate and are awaiting responses.
   Officials want to work any kinks out of the program before
extending it to Commonwealth Edison Co., the state's largest
electrical utility, which serves 3 million northern Illinois
customers, Ms. Blackman said.
   All 2,600 CIPS employees are being trained as gatekeepers, said
spokesman Ed McDowell, adding the utility views the program as a
way to promote good will.
   ``It's a win-win situation from our company's perspective,'' he
said. ``We see it as an opportunity to help CIPS customers and get
information (about government sevices) that is useful in our own
lives.
   ``We are the eyes and ears for government agencies.''
   Gatekeepers have been operating since last fall in some areas of
Illinois. Similar programs are in place in more than half of the
other states, said Don Kent, a Washington spokesman for the U.S.
Administration on Aging.

   The first female member of the
Friars Club of Beverly Hills filed a sex discrimination complaint
Monday because she is being denied use of its health club.
   ``Obviously, such second-class citizenship within the club could
deter many women from joining,'' said attorney Gloria Allred,
noting she pays the same dues as male club members.
   ``The fight for women's equality will not end until women are
permitted both in the board rooms and the steam rooms,'' she said.
   The state Board of Equalization can disallow business tax
expenses at private clubs that discriminate under a rule that took
effect Jan. 1. Equalization board member Conway Collis said he
wanted to inspect the Friars Club facilities this week.
   When Allred became the Friars' first female dues-paying member
in its 32-year history in May, she was greeted warmly by comedian
and Friars President Milton Berle. Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin
are also members, and President Reagan is a past president.
   The Friars Club is primarily a theatrical social club.
   In January, Allred asked Friars officials about arrangements for
women wishing to use the sauna, steam room and whirlpool. There are
four women in the club, but Allred is the only one who wants to use
the health club.
   ``There is no legal requirement on the part of the club to
afford you the use of the health club facilities,'' Friars Club
legal chairman William Sarnoff said in a letter of reply.
   There was no immediate comment from the Friars Club on Monday,
and a message was left for Sarnoff at club.

   China announced Monday a major reorganization of
its top bureaucracy to cut the state's role in direct management of
the economy, eliminate 10,000 jobs and modernize operations.
   State Councillor Song Ping, head of the Communist Party
Organization Department, said 14 ministries under the State Council
will be abolished, one will be reorganized, and 10 new ministries
will be set up.
   The State Council is equivalent to China's Cabinet.
   Song told a meeting of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, that the reorganization will mean a net reduction of
five organs under the State Council, and is to be accomplished
within three months of approval by the present session of the
congress.
   The reorganization will lay the groundwork for further
restructuring of the State Council, Song said.
   He said the government will no longer manage enterprises
directly, as it has under Soviet-style central planning. Government
departments instead will be responsible for general planning,
finances, supervision and regulation.
   The changes, according to Song, will be aimed at overcoming such
problems as inefficiency, overstaffing, overlapping functions,
overly rigid low-level management, insufficient overall control and
lack of clarity about duties.
   He said the the staff directly under the State Council will be
reduced from 50,000 to 40,000.
   The 10,000 people to be pared from State Council payrolls will
be transferred to units handling taxation, finance, prices,
auditing, supervision, statistics and law enforcement. Many will
join companies and institutions engaged in information, consultancy
and research, he said.
   The National People's Congress, which convened last week, is
also to pass a law guaranteeing the rights of factory managers to
run their plants without undue interference from the government.
   The 10 new units to be created are the ministries of personnel,
labor, materials, transportation, energy, construction, aeronautics
and astronautics industry, water resources, machine building and
electronics and the State Planning Commission.
   The planning commission will be comprised of the present
planning and economic commissions. Song said the commission will be
in charge of formulating China's economic and social development
strategies and will no longer be involved in direct management of
trade and industrial operations.
   Economic expert Yao Yilin, vice premier and head of the present
State Planning Commission, is expected to head the new, more
powerful commission.
   The Labor and Personnel Ministry will be split into two
ministries, with the new Personnel Ministry in charge of
introducing a civil servant system.
   The new Transportation Ministry will combine the ministries of
railways and communications and the State Air Transport Control
Administration.
   The proposed Energy Ministry was described by Song as a
superbody encompassing the work of the ministries of the coal
industry, petroleum industry and nuclear industry.
   Xinhua News Agency, the state news agency, will become a
separate institution under the State Council.

   Suspected communist rebels on Monday
attacked a mayor who is related to President Corazon Aquino,
killing seven of his bodyguards and wounding him, police said.
   It was the bloodiest attack in the capital area since guerrillas
took up arms against the government 19 years ago.
   Mayor Prospero Oreta of suburban Malabon suffered three gunshot
wounds in the mouth, chest and arm, police said. He was reported to
be out of danger after surgery.
   Oreta, 45, is a brother-in-law of Rep. Tessie Oreta, sister of
Mrs. Aquino's assassinated husband, former Sen. Benigno S. Aquino
Jr.
   Hours after the attack on Oreta, assassins shot dead the brother
of a prominent leftist politician. The leader said he may have been
the intended target.
   Also Monday, communist rebels killed a bus driver and wounded
his wife in suburban Pasay City, authorities said.
   The killings occurred as military units around the country were
on full alert in anticipation of stepped-up rebel attacks marking
Tuesday's 19th anniversary of the 24,000-member New People's Army.
The group is the military wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines.
   Communist rebels have been blamed for killing more than 150
policemen and soldiers in the Manila area since last year. The
rebels recently announced plans to intensify the killings, which in
the past have been limited to one or two victims at a time.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a statement, said she was dismayed by Monday's
violence.
   ``I have always asked our people to resort to the ways of
peace,'' she said. ``My hope is that as democracy in our country
gains a strong foothold, violence and terror will gradually
rescind.''
   Oreta and his bodyguards were attacked as they traveled in two
cars bound for a flag-raising ceremony at Malabon town hall two
miles away. Police Cpl. Mario Odulio said Oreta's ambushers used
AK-47 and M-16 automatic assault rifles as well as 9mm and
.45-caliber pistols. They escaped in a van and a jeep.
   Local news reports said that shortly after the ambush, a man
called Manila police to claim responsibility on behalf of the Alex
Boncayao Brigade, the leftist rebel unit operating in the capital.
But Armed Forces spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said police had not
established the call's authenticity.
   Florendo said the military was investigating whether the ambush
on Oreta was in retaliation for the slaying of leftist youth leader
Lean Alejandro in September. He lost to Mrs. Oreta in a hotly
contested congressional race last year, and leftist groups had
linked the Oreta family to his murder. The Oretas had denied any
connection.
   Seven hours after the Oreta ambush, three men in a car shot and
killed the brother of Jose Castro, vice president of the Manila
chapter of the leftist People's Party. He said he may have been the
intended victim, and he added he had received death threats since
Alejandro's death.

   Thousands of cable car fans cheered Monday
as a parade of the cars, decorated like floats with balloons,
daffodils and streamers, proudly lurched along Powell Street in
celebration of the line's 100th birthday.
   Costumed characters portraying cable car inventor Andrew S.
Hallidie and other historical figures rode the 14 cars in the
parade under arches of balloons strung across Powell.
   West German tourist Manfred Himpil climbed aboard a cable car
for the first time.
   ``They're wonderful, really wonderful, just marvelous,'' he
said. ``When the streets end in the heavens, then comes another
view.''
   Mayor Art Agnos proclaimed the day ``Freidel Klussmann Day'' in
honor of the late neighborhood activist who helped save the cable
cars from bus advocates in the 1940s.
   ``They're out of doors and they're open-air seating, and I love
the history behind them,'' said San Franciscan Gail Hansell, 26,
watching the parade atop a hill with a dramatic view of downtown
San Francisco and the bay on a warm, windy morning.
   ``They're romantic as well because they are old and they are a
tradition. They are a beautiful way to see the city,'' said Hansell.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan estimated the crowd at the parade at
nearly 3,000.
   The Powell Street line, which began service in 1888, carries
about 41,000 passengers a day on 3{-mile panoramic rides over hills
with views of Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Union Square
and Market Street.
   Powell Street also is the line where operator Carl Payne has
delighted visitors for 26 years with his cable car bell-ringing,
livening the foggy evenings with cheery melodies.
   ``It's great to be part of this celebration. It's really
special,'' Payne said, adding jokingly, ``I'm hoping to be here at
the 200-year mark.''
   The Powell Street line, which like all cable cars is owned by
the San Francisco Municipal Railway, was built by the Ferries &
Cliff House Railroad Co. and became part of the city's United
Railways system in 1902.
   Most of the tracks were destroyed in the great earthquake and
fire on April 18, 1906, but since electric streetcars could not
climb Powell Street, the United Railways restored enough of the
track to use 27 of the Powell cars unharmed in the fire.
   A Navy jazz band led the procession, while gripman Payne, the
nine-time champion bell ringer, clanged Dixieland melodies in the
lead car.
   In their heyday, cable cars operated along eight lines. The only
survivors today are the the century-old Powell Street line, a newer
Powell line that branches onto another street, and their sister
California Street line, whose 100th anniversary 15 years ago set
off a two-week party.
   The rattle-trap cars, propelled by a cable under the street,
rumble along at 9{ mph and lack the comfortable seats and space of
modern buses. But they were saved in the 1940s after a campaign by
Klussmann, and a court once declared illegal a 1956 attempt to
radically modernize the cars. In 1964, they were named the United
States' first moving National Historical Landmark.

<HEAD>Opposition Politician Arrested in Explosion Case, Expelled from
Party</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An opposition leader was arrested
in connection with an explosion at a bridge and two Americans
staying with him are under house arrest, according to party and
other reports Monday.
   Joseph Douze, second in command of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, was arrested Saturday and charged in the
explosion March 22 under the Croix des Bouquets Bridge, party
leader Sylvio Claude said. The blast caused no damage or injuries.
   Claude said Douze, a physician with dual Haitian and American
citizenship, had been planted in the party by the government and he
had been expelled.
   Douze, provisional vice president of the party, was shown on
government television Saturday night during an army search of his
home.
   Nancy Horn of Wells Tannery, Pa., and James Gunnels of Macon,
Ga., told The Associated Press by telephone they were friends of
Douze's staying at his home in Thomassin, outside Port-au-Prince.
   Ms. Horn said she was an associate of Douze and had been in
Haiti since 1967. Gunnels said he was a visiting businessman.
   The officer who directed the search of Douze's home said on
television Sunday the Americans ``have a certain responsibility in
the affair,'' but did not elaborate.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said consular officials had
been in contact with the Americans. Lite said they were forbidden
to leave the house, but he did not know whether they would be
formally arrested.
   Anaise Chavenet, spokeswoman for the Information Ministry, told
the AP the Americans were under surveillance, not house arrest,
while the army investigates whether they were involved in the
bombing.
   Both Americans denied knowledge of the explosion.
   ``I know nothing about this affair,'' Gunnels said. ``I was just
a guest in his home for a few days.''
   According to Ms. Horn, Douze is in his mid-40s and spent several
years in the United States during the Duvalier family dictatorship,
which lasted from 1957 to February 1986.
   Claude accused President Leslie Manigat's government of planting
people in his party with instructions to discredit and destroy it.
Claude, a Protestant clergymen, was one of the four most popular
presidential candidates in Nov. 29 elections that were suspended
because of violence.
   In its report Sunday, Television Nationale said Douze was
arrested for possession of detonators, wiring for explosives, a
remote control detonating device and automatic rifles.
   Jocelin Brochard, a former army corporal and the Christian
Democrats head of security, and two women were arrested last
Wednesday in connection with the bridge explosion.
   Several sticks of dynamite, two assault rifles and a large bag
of marijuana were found on the roof of the women's home in Bel-Air,
a Port-au-Prince slum, police said.
   Brochard said on state televison that Douze supplied the weapons.
   Claude denied knowing Brochard or Douze were involved in the
bombing, and said some party members who advocated violence had
been expelled in the past.

<HEAD>Kansas Firm Licensed To Market Pseudorabies Vaccine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Kansas firm has been licensed to market a
genetically engineered vaccine to control pseudorabies in swine, a
contagious disease that can be deadly to newborn pigs, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The vaccine will be marketed by SyntroVet Inc., Lenexa, Kan.,
said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service. He said the new vaccine is the
third live genetically engineered product licensed by the
department for pseudorabies vaccination.
   ``We have concluded the new vaccine is both safe and
effective,'' Glosser said. ``Our scientists have reviewed and
analyzed the procedures used to develop the vaccine, its biological
and safety characteristics, and the safety and effectiveness data
gathered during field trials in three states.''
   Further, he said, an environmental assessment concluded that use
of the vaccine would have ``no significant impact on the human
environment.''
   ``During field trials, the new vaccine was administered to more
than 400 swine, including baby pigs, weaned pigs and sows,''
Glosser said. ``No adverse reactions were noted.''
   Pseudorabies, also known as Aujesky's disease or mad itch, does
not affect humans. Although the disease caused an estimated $22
million in losses to the swine industry last year, it is not a
public health problem, he said.

   A suspect in the slayings of five people in a
supermarket last year turned himself in to federal marshals Monday,
authorities said.
   Donnie Blankenship entered the U.S. marshal's office in the
Federal Courthouse at midday and said he wanted to have his bond
lifted, Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick Buckles said.
   Blankenship was jailed a short time later, Buckles said.
   Police began searching for Blankenship on Friday after a grand
jury indicted him and another man on five counts of murder each in
the slayings at a National supermarket on the city's north side
Sept. 4.
   One suspect, Marvin Jennings, 27, of Overland, was arrested
Friday. Blankenship, 26, of Hanley Hills, had last been seen Friday
night in north St. Louis.
   Investigators believe two men entered the supermarket after it
closed, possibly by posing as a cleaning crew. A security guard was
taken by surprise and killed. Six other employees were ordered to
lie on the floor and were shot in the back of the head. Two people
survived.
   Until about two weeks ago, Blankenship had been jailed since
November on a charge of felony possession of a firearm, a
.38-caliber revolver believed to be the one taken from the security
guard during the robbery, Buckles said. Buckles said Blankenship
had previously been convicted of assaulting a postal service
employee.
   Blankenship was in custody on the weapons charges until about
two weeks ago, when he used his aunt's house to make a $10,000 bond
and was released, police said.
   Blankenship was arrested after police found the revolver in the
trunk of a car that had been stopped for speeding. The driver of
the vehicle said he had bought the gun from Blankenship, his
nephew, in late September, police said.

<HEAD>Wright Disavows Knowledge of Aid's Bid To Sell Weapons to Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said Monday he was
unaware that his friend and adviser, Richard Pena, had tried to
sell weapons to the Contras through former White House aide Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North's secret Contra aid operation.
   ``I don't know a thing in the world about that,'' Wright,
D-Texas, said when asked by reporters about an arms-sale offer made
by Pena in August 1986, three months before disclosure of the
Iran-Contra weapons and money affair shut down the North network.
   Wright said if Pena was involved in such activity, it was ``at a
time when he wasn't directly working with me.''
   The speaker has a record of opposition to U.S. military aid to
the Contra rebels tyring to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. He
also has been active in working toward a negotiated peace in
Nicaragua.
   In an Aug. 15, 1986, letter, Pena wrote to a front company set
up by North's associate, Richard Miller, offering to procure
grenades, bombs, mines and boots from two South American companies.
   The letter went to World Affairs Counselors, a Cayman Islands
front company formed by Miller and his partner, Frank Gomez, to
handle their Contra transactions for North.
   Wright said he first learned of the matter when contacted last
week by The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of Pena's
letter.
   He said he knew of no activity by Pena that was ``unethical or
illegal or at all dishonest.''
   He said Pena was a friend and ``very knowledgeable person''
whose Spanish speaking ability has helped Wright pick up
conversational details the speaker sometimes misses regarding
Central American issues.
   Pena has been one of Wright's advisers on Central America over
the past several years and as recently as January was the Texas
Democrat's paid emissary to the region as the warring factions
wrangled over starting cease-fire talks, Wright aide Marshall Lynam
said. He said Pena was on the speaker's payroll for a few days on
each of three occasions.
   Pena now works for a lobbying firm, Cassidy and Associates. His
office said he was on vacation and had not checked in for messages
as of Monday.
   Pena was deposed by the congressional committees investigating
the secret sale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of funds
to the Contras. Pena told investigators he contacted Miller in
hopes of making a deal for part of the $70 million in renewed
Contra military aid that Congress approved in the fall of 1986,
according to a Capitol Hill source who read Pena's deposition.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
deposition contained no mention of Wright or North. Pena said he
knew Miller was involved with the Contras.
   Pena indicated to investigators that he thought he could offer
the Contras a better deal than they would get through other U.S.
purchasing routes, the source said.
   It was unclear why Pena would have gone to Miller, a
non-government businessman, and the Cayman company to arrange the
deal rather than through U.S. government channels.
   Pena worked as a House Foreign Affairs Committee staff
consultant from August 1982 to November 1985, a job for which
Wright recommended him.
   One former staff member for the congressional Iran-Contra
investigating committees said the committee staff decided not to
pursue the Pena matter because it appeared to be an isolated
incident, rather than an integral part of the North network.
   Miller pleaded guilty in the Iran-Contra case, along with
conservative fund-raiser Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, to conspiring
with North to defraud the government by raising money through a
tax-exempt foundation to purchase weapons for the Contras.
   Miller worked with North, then a National Security Council aide,
raising private money to help the Contras during the congressional
ban on U.S. aid.
   Miller's company, International Business Communications, routed
nearly $3 million through the Caymans, which was disbursed at
North's direction to the rebel effort, the Iran-Contra committees'
report said.
   North has been charged along with President Reagan's former
national security adviser, Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, and two
other men with conspiring to defraud the United States of $17
million in Iran arms sale proceeds and for operating a secret
Contra assistance program during the aid ban.

<HEAD>Alabama Democratic Chairman Exploring Bloc Vote for Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Alabama Democratic
Party said Monday he is exploring the possibility of forming a
Southern group of uncommitted delegates to endorse an ``electable''
presidential candidate.
   ``We've got to keep one eye, if not two eyes, on the November
general election,'' said John Baker of Montgomery. ``I'm tired of
the Democratic Party having a ticket that can't carry but one or
two states. I'm embarrassed by losing four out of the last five
elections.''
   The party chairman hopes to find 50 to 100 Southern ``super
delegates'' who are interested in making a joint endorsement.
Unlike delegates elected in the Super Tuesday primary, the party
officials and others dubbed super delegates are not committed to a
particular candidate.
   Baker sent letters to Alabama's 12 super delegates and to 13
Southern party chairman to see if they were interested in trying to
make a joint endorsement.
   ``It's possible this group could make a commitment at the same
time. That would be a tremendous boost to someone,'' Baker said.
But it's too early at this point to say which of the Democratic
candidates might be electable in November, he added.

<HEAD>Super Tuesday TV Coverage Poor, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>Washington (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lead-off presidential caucuses received
twice as much television coverage as all 20 Super Tuesday contests
this year on network evening newscasts, a media analyst says.
   Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, said the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses also got
short shrift compared to the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 16.
   Iowans chose 89 GOP and Democratic delegates in their Feb. 8
caucuses, which were the subject of 105 stories, Lichter said. In
New Hampshire only 40 delegates were chosen, and more than 80
stories were aired.
   Super Tuesday, by contrast, had 2,056 delegates at stake but the
three major networks ran only 53 stories, Lichter said.
   Lichter labeled Super Tuesday a failure because it failed to
shift the focus of attention to the South. ``The media shined a
1,000-watt spotlight on the early primaries and a one-watt
flashlight on Super Tuesday,'' he said.

<HEAD>Miscroscopic Worm May Help Curb Crop Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the costliest crop pests of farmers and
home gardeners may one day be curbed by a natural enemy, a
microscopic killer worm that searches the soil for the corn
rootworm, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The tiny worm, or nematode, is called Steinernema feltiae. After
infecting the rootworm, the nematode releases a bacterium that
kills the pest. Then, said USDA entomologist Jan J. Jackson, the
nematode uses the larva's body as a place to reproduce while it
feasts on bacteria and larva tissue.
   About 10 days later, hundreds of new nematodes emerge and start
searching for more rootworms.
   ``That gives you an advantage over chemical controls,'' he said
in a report by the department's Agricultural Research Service. ``A
chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm to come to it.
The nematode doesn't wait.''
   But Jackson found that the nematodes don't persist in the ground
long enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation. In one field trial
where he works at the department's Northern Grain Insects Research
Laboratory in Brookings, S.D., Jackson applied 100,000 nematodes to
the base of each of several corn plants, reducing rootworm damage
by 11 percent
   Jackson said that is not an acceptable level of control, but he
expects further research could lead to protection as good as from
chemical insecticides. A separate test with a chemical reduced root
damage by 44 percent.
   Rootworm larvae destroy corn roots, and adults feed on the
leaves, tassels and ears. Jackson said U.S. corn producers spend
nearly $350 million a year to fight the rootworms. Nematodes
probably could be produced at about the same cost, without the risk
of chemical injury to farmers and the environment.

<TEXT>
   The Israeli army on Monday imposed its broadest
restrictions yet on the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories, sealing the regions for three days to combat a PLO day
of protest.
   Army spokesmen said journalists were being barred from the
territories, where 119 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have
been killed in nearly four months of violence.
   It is the first such ban since Israel captured the West Bank and
Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Under the orders, the 650,000 Palestinians in Gaza cannot leave
their homes and the 850,000 in the West Bank will be confined to
their villages and towns, the army said.
   The 65,000 Jewish settlers who in the occupied lands will be
permitted to move freely.
   An army statement said the three-day shutdown began at 10 p.m.
Monday in the Gaza Strip and 1 a.m. Tuesday in the West Bank.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
telephone links to the Gaza Strip also were cut for the three days.
   Another rule bars Palestinians from crossing the two bridges
over the Jordan River, the army said, but incoming traffic from
Jordan will be permitted. About 110,000 Arabs who work in Israel
will not be able to leave the territories.
   In Washington, the State Department criticized Israel for
sealing off the territories.
   ``We regret the decision because of the impact it wll have on
commerce, on visits with family members and the press,'' spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   On Friday, the department advised U.S. citizens to avoid travel
to the areas because of continuing disturbances.
   The closure followed a mass arrest campaign aimed at preventing
violence Wednesday, when Palestinians mark Land Day, the 12th
anniversary of a 1976 clash between soldiers and Arabs over the
confiscation of Arab land. Six Palestinians were killed.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has ordered widespread
protests against Israeli troops and Jewish settlers.
   Israel's ability to deal with expected unrest on Land Day is
viewed as a major test of the military's muscle to quell the
uprising that began Dec. 8.
   The closure ``stems first from our desire to tell the Arabs `You
decided on Land Day, so let's have a confrontation. We'll see who
wins,''' Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Israel radio.
``Remember, we have not exhausted every means of control at our
disposal.''
   Rabin said the measures also were taken to prevent Arabs from
the occupied territories from inciting violence among Arabs who
live in Israel.
   Robert Slater, president of the Foreign Press Association,
condemned the restrictions and said the group was considering legal
action. He said the association had rejected an army offer to allow
a media pool into the territories accompanied by a military
spokesman.
   ``Pools are meant for when there is no room for huge numbers of
people and there is obviously plenty of room for everybody in the
territories,'' said Slater, of Time magazine.
   Israel's 24-member Cabinet authorized the measures during its
weekly session Sunday, Israeli officials said.
   ``The purpose is to keep the territories quiet. It is not
directed specifically against the press, but we don't want to give
the people of the areas any reason for causing disturbances,'' said
a senior Defense Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In addition to the new measures, troops have arrested about 550
Arabs since Saturday, including at least 75 overnight Monday in the
Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem and the Jabaliya camp in Gaza,
the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said.
   Police spokeswoman Ruth Lessinger said security was also
increased in Arab areas of Israel, with traffic police summoned for
riot duty, all police vacations canceled and 12-hour work days
ordered for officers.
   She said 4,000 extra police would be ready for mobilization
Wednesday and could be taken by helicopter to trouble spots.
   Left-wing legislator Gadi Yatziv of Mapam said the restrictions
were ``the first significant victory of the uprising.''
   ``The Arabs have managed to force us to take undemocratic
measures and the message we will convey on Land Day will be more
negative than anything else,'' Yatziv said on the radio.
   On the political front, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir sharply
protested a meeting between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
two Arab-Americans linked to the PLO.
   ``We see as very grave the attempts of the Americans to initiate
contacts with PLO members,'' Shamir said in an address to Israel's
120-member Parliament.
   Shultz met Saturday with Edward Said and Ibrahim Abu Lughod, who
are U.S. citizens and members of the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   A 19-year-old Palestinian, meanwhile, died of a gunshot wound to
the heart suffered during a clash Sunday in the West Bank village
of Salfit, Israel radio and the Palestine Press Service said.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Implementation of Pact With Trust Territory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday approved a resolution
authorizing the Reagan administration to implement the proposed
compact of free association between the United States and the
Pacific trust territory of Palau.
   The voice-vote action sent the measure to the House, where
similar legislation has been stalled by an investigation by the
Interior Committee into allegations of governmental corruption in
Palau.
   The Senate resolution would permit the compact, which would end
40 years of U.S. trusteeship over Palau, to be implemented so long
as there is no pending legal challenge to a plebescite last summer
in the islands.
   Palauan dissidents have talked of filing a court suit
challenging the legality of the plebescite in which a majority of
voters approved amending their constitution to drop its prohibition
against nuclear weapons in Palau.
   Leaders of the Interior Committee have sent congressional
investigators to Palau to probe allegations that senior Palau
officials may be involved with the smuggling of Southeast Asia
heroin into the United States.
   The investigators also are looking into reports that Palau
officials have have received unjustified payments from a British
company that built a power plant for the Palau government.
   The administration, which sees Palau as a militarily strategic
area, has been pressing Congress to allow it to implement the
compact so it can get the United Nations to cancel the trusteeship
imposed after World War II.
   Under the proposed compact, the United States would handle
military and diplomatic affairs for Palau, whose ailing economy
would get some $428 million in U.S. aid in the first 15 years of
the 50-year pact.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Monday to stop next
Sunday's hike in postal rates, ruling he lacked jurisdiction to
order the Postal Service to delay the increase for two months.
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey ruled that he did not have
jurisdiction to rule on a request by trade groups representing
mail-order and direct-mail firms for an injunction delaying the
imposition of the new postal rates until June 4.
   But Richey said the trade groups could take their complaint to
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   The plaintiffs, including the Mail Order Association of America,
the Third Class Mail Association and the Magazine Publishers
Association, contended that any increase before June 4 was illegal.
   The suit charged that the Postal Rate Commission calculated the
rate hike to take effect on that date and that the Postal Service
lacked authority to charge higher rates before then.
   The Postal Service will raise an extra $700 million by raising
rates in April instead of June, the lawsuit said.
   On Sunday, the cost of first-class stamps will increase from 22
cents to 25 cents with corresponding hikes for second, third and
fourth-class mail.

   The U.S. Navy confiscated film from a
member of a Pentagon news pool in the Persian Gulf for security
reasons, but the Pentagon said Monday afternoon it was being
returned.
   Thomas Salyer, a photographer for United Press International,
said intelligence officers refused to return 36 of 61 negatives he
took of an abandoned Iranian gunboat seized Thursday by the guided
missile frigate Reuben James in the Strait of Hormuz.
   It was the first known confiscation of material from a pool
member.
   U.S. officials had directed earlier that some portions of tape
taken by an NBC cameraman in the pool be blocked out. The team
later was allowed to dub a version of its own tape with those
portions excluded.
   In Washington, the Pentagon released a statement Monday from the
U.S. Central Command saying Salyer's film was being returned.
   ``Three rolls of film were developed and half of the exposures
were withheld from the UPI photographer by Navy officials after a
determination was made at the scene that the information revealed
in the film was classified,'' it said.
   ``In retrospect, the decision to classify the film was overly
cautious. Officers at the U.S. Central Command reviewed the list of
materials found on the boat, and have have found no sensitive
materials to warrant continued withholding of the film.''
   The official concern in both cases was over showing certain
artillery shells found in the boat, the serial numbers on its gun _
a 25mm anti-aircraft weapon _ and a large box that was sealed but
believed to contain ammunition.
   The wooden box was not opened aboard the Reuben James, and U.S.
officers refused to speculate on what it contained.
   Standing rules governing the Pentagon news pools provide that
all written, audio and pictorial material must be cleared for
security by U.S. officials at the Department of Defense before it
can be released and distributed generally to media being served by
the pool.
   This material is scrutinized at the operational level, such as
aboard ships, but is not censored. If there is a question
concerning security, it is referred to the Department of Defense.
   Although the system has been in effect for several years, the
Persian Gulf is the first place it has been used for coverage of
real military operations rather than maneuvers and exercises.
   Since the news pools were instituted for the gulf in July, there
have been several cases in which pool escort officers alerted
Defense Department officials to a potental security problem in
written news copy, but in all cases it was cleared by the Pentagon
as written.
   The Pentagon also has not objected to any audio, video or photo
reports obtained by the pool journalists.
   Salyer said he was asked to submit his film for examination by
intelligence experts aboard the USS Coronado, command ship of the
Joint Task Force Middle East and its gulf-based component, the
Middle East Force.
   He said that after three officers had spent several hours
examining it, he was told some of the film would be kept because
when blown up to larger size it revealed the serial numbers of the
gun, or disclosed other valuable intelligence data.
   Salyer, noting that he had earlier been allowed to ship some
other film of the boat and the nighttime operation to recover it,
said he thought the officers ``overreacted'' in confiscating the
second batch of pictures.
   He said the Navy also seemed to be imposing a ``double
standard'' on him that didn't apply to others.
   ``We were all told in advance that the boat material would be
subjected to security review,'' Salyer said. ``After looking at the
film, they said I could have only a part of it back and I could
appeal through the Freedom of Information Act for the rest of it.''
   Experienced pool participants could recall no previous occasion
when any news material was confiscated.
   Maj. Barry Willey, a public affairs officer assigned to the pool
from the U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., said he
also did not recall a precedent.
   Willey said the decision to withhold the film was made here
because there was no way to get it to the Pentagon for review ``in
a timely manner.''

<HEAD>Claim army issued distorted report on bus incident</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten American and European academics on Monday
disputed the army account of an incident involving the visitors'
tour bus that led to a clash in which Israeli soldiers fatally shot
two Palestinians.
   ``The version released by the army spokesman is, to put it
mildly, a gross distortion,'' said Zachary Lockman, who teaches
Middle East history at Harvard University.
   ``We're quite concerned about our trip being used as a pretext
for what followed,'' he told a news conference about the incident
Sunday.
   An army spokesman said Sunday that soldiers went to the rescue
of an Israeli tour bus under attack in the Arab town of Salfit, 20
miles north of Jerusalem.
   He said the bus driver mistakenly entered Salfit, and
Palestinans stoned the vehicle and then attacked soldiers sent to
the scene. The soldiers responded with gunfire that killed two
Palestinians, he said.
   On Monday, an army spokeswoman said soldiers entered the town
becaue of reports of a hijacked bus.
   ``They quickly discovered there was nothing wrong and began to
withdraw, when the soldiers were attacked by a large group of
hundreds of Arabs throwing bottles, pieces of metal and concrete
blocks,'' said the spokeswoman, who was not identified in line with
military regulations.
   Lockman, joined by other other professors at the news
conference, said the vehicle was clearly marked as a bus from Bir
Zeit University, an Arab institution. He said their group had gone
to Salfit to talk with Palestinians.
   He said villagers greeted them warmly and the town was peaceful
throughout the 30- to 45-minute stay.
   Lockman, who speaks Hebrew, said he overheard an army officer at
a checkpoint tell his commanding officer by radio ``that we (the
tour group) had not been under any threat whatsoever.'' He said an
army helicopter flew over Salfit during the group's visit.
   He added that as the bus left the area it went by a force of
soldiers heading toward the town.
   Jack Taft, a lecturer in peace and conflict studies at the
University of California at Berkeley, noted that the army
frequently bars reporters from scenes of conflict.
   ``I think that's the central point,'' he said. ``The army as the
sole source of information can fabricate any story it likes.''

   U.N.-sponsored Afghanistan talks resumed Monday,
after a weekend recess and word that Moscow remains unyielding in
the dispute over foreign arms supplies to parties in the conflict.
   Pakistan's chief negotiator said the question of ``symmetry'' _
simultaneous cessation of Soviet military aid to the Kabul
government and U.S. aid to the Moslem guerrillas fighting it _ was
the final unresolved issue.
   Acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani said that, for ``the United
States and Pakistan (it) is of major concern.''
   It is outside the formal scope of the indirect Geneva talks
between Islamabad and Kabul, but the superpowers are the designated
guarantors of any peace settlement. The United States has said it
will accept that role only if there is a ``balance of obligations.''
   Speaking to reporters before a formal session with U.N. mediator
Diego Cordovez, Noorani said the moment Moscow agrees on a
symmetrical cutoff of arms aid, ``my pen is with me and I will
sign.''
   Over the weekend, Noorani met with special Soviet envoy Nikolay
Kozyrev, who has been following the talks from the wings since the
latest round began March 2.
   Sources close to the Pakistani delegation said Kozyrev made
clear that Moscow remains firm on the arms cutoff. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, meeting last week with Soviet Foreign
Minister A. Eduard Shevardnadze in Washington, indicated
flexibility in the U.S. stand.
   Shultz suggested the superpowers agree at least on a temporary
freeze or ``something close to it.'' But Shevardnadze ruled out
symmetry. The Soviets reject the U.S. symmetry demand as amounting
to interference with relations between two states, noting that
Moscow and Kabul are bound by international treaties.
   Kozyrev reportedly suggested Pakistan go ahead and sign the
three main accords without waiting for U.S. and Soviet agreement on
the fourth, spelling out the superpower guarantees.
   Shevardnadze struck that note last week at a Washington news
conference when he said the ``Afghan question can be resolved
without U.S. guarantees.''
   The text of the peace package, said to comprise about 25
typewritten pages, has been translated and scrutinized by legal
experts. Noorani says he considers the documents complete.
Afghanistan was reported still opposed to having the text refer to
``international boundaries'' because of what it considers a border
dispute dating to Pakistan's independence.
   Sources close to the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said they were confident that question could be settled.

<HEAD>Inflation-Fighting Pact Extended Through May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government, business and labor have agreed to
hold the line on wages and prices and extend an inflation-fighting
program through May.
   The so-called Economic Solidarity Pact has been in effect since
December and President Miguel de la Madrid said it seems to be
stemming inflation, which hit a record annual rate 159.2 percent
last year.
   De la Madrid and representatives of business and labor signed
the extension in a ceremony at the presidential palace Sunday. He
said Mexico may soon be able to get inflation down to about 2
percent a month, according to a statement from the presidential
office.
   At the signing ceremony, the president said more must be done to
solve Mexico's economic problems. Besides inflation, those include
high unemployment and the second-highest foreign debt in the
developing world, $105 billion.
   ``There should be satisfaction with what has been achieved so
far, but at the same time there should be a recognition that the
work ahead will be difficult and complex,'' he said.
   Under the extended agreement, the value of the peso _ 2,280 to
the dollar _ and the minimum daily wage of 8,000 pesos, or about
$3.50, will remain steady through May.
   De la Madrid's government agreed not to raise the price of goods
and services it provides or controls through through that period,
and business leaders said they would keep prices steady.
   The Bank of Mexico, the nation's central bank, said it would
lower interest rates on several financial instruments.
   Last week, the president said a ``minority'' in the private
sector had violated the pact. On Sunday, he urged violators to
follow the example of the vast majority of businesses in honoring
the anti-inflation program.

   Gunmen believed to be Sikh radicals
killed at least 18 people in attacks within a 20-mile radius of
Amritsar, the Sikh holy city, police said Monday.
   They said victims Sunday included four members of a Hindu family
killed in their home and a Sikh policeman visiting a village for
his sister's wedding.
   The constable's uncle also was killed.
   Attacks by militants have taken 550 lives so far this year. At
least 1,000 people were killed in 1987 by Sikhs fighting for an
independent homeland in Punjab, the only province of India where
members of the sect form a majority.
   Most victims have been Hindus and moderate Sikhs who oppose the
militants.
   Police said men with automatic rifles killed four members of a
Hindu family in Manowal, a village 20 miles west of Amritsar. A
neighbor who came when he heard gunfire also was killed.
   Others slain included seven employees of a brick kiln _ four
Hindus and three Sikhs _ and two Sikh members of the Marxist
Communist Party.
   Bodies of two other men killed were not identified.
   Officials said they did not know the motives for the killings.
   Sikhs account for 2 percent of India's 800 million people, the
vast majority of whom are Hindus.
   Amritsar is home to the sect's main shrine, the Golden Temple,
and the center of the militant movement for a separate Sikh nation
in the northern province, India's most productive agricultural
region.

   A cold front raced across the Rockies and Plains states Monday,
bringing cold and snow to an area that had basked in springlike
weather over the weekend. A blizzard hit parts of Montana.
   The temperature early Monday afternoon plunged to 33 degrees in
Pueblo, Colo., where a day earlier it had reached 85 degrees.
Similar bone-chilling drops were reported across a wide region.
   A blizzard raged across parts of Montana during the morning
hours. Strong winds produced subzero wind-chill readings and poor
visibility.
   Before moving out by midday, the storm system also covered roads
with ice and left 2 inches of wind-whipped snow in much of Utah. A
rash of accidents, including a fatal car-train collision, was
blamed on the storm there.
   Snow and gusty winds were also reported as far east as the
central Plains. A high wind warning was posted in the mountains of
New Mexico, and wind advisories were posted in some Texas mountain
passes and the mountains of Southern California.
   An advisory for snow was posted for the northern and central
mountains and the northeastern plains of Colorado, and a winter
storm watch was been posted through Tuesday morning for
northwestern Kansas.
   Farther south, the front created some fears of severe
thunderstorms and possible tornadoes in parts of southeastern
Kansas, Oklahoma and west-central Texas.
   In northern and central Minnesota, the precipitation took the
form of a mixture of rain, freezing drizzle and snow, while showers
and thunderstorms were numerous across southern Wisconsin, northern
and central Illinois, and northeastern Missouri, and from
southwestern Iowa to north-central Texas.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 0.89 inch at Rockford, Ill.; 0.85 inch at Peoria,
Ill.; 0.56 inch at Madison, Wis.; 0.48 inch at Dubuque, Iowa, and
Moline, Ill., and 0.47 inch at Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 92 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
The early morning low for the nation was zero at Yellowstone Park.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms in
the southern and central Plains and the Mississippi Valley to the
Great Lakes, with snow in parts of northern Minnesota and Upper
Michigan. Rain showers, with snow in the higher elevations, also
were forecast across the Pacific Northwest into the northern
Rockies.
   Temperatures in the 30s and 40s were forecast from the northern
and central Rockies through the northern and central Plains to
Upper Michigan, and across northern New England; in the 70s in
Southern California and southern Arizona, and from the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas to the southern and mid-Atlantic Coast states; in
the 80s in south-central Texas and across the Florida Peninsula,
and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of the nation.

   Iran said Monday its Revolutionary Guards
repulsed an Iraqi counterattack in their drive into Kurdistan and
now hold more than 540 square miles of the strategic region in
northeast Iraq.
   Iranian gunboats attacked two supertankers in the Persian Gulf,
setting them ablaze. And Iraqi-backed opponents of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini claimed several thousand of their fighters
overran Iranian positions in southwest Iran.
   Iraq, which has admitted it has lost ground in the mountainous
northeast, vowed to ``destroy the Iranian aggressors with all
available means.''
   Baghdad's official news agency said the Iraqis fired three
long-range missiles into the holy city of Qom, 100 miles south of
Tehran, while warplanes bombed four Iranian towns to avenge
``Iranian attacks on our cities and border.''
   Qom is the seat of Iran's religious hierarchy and crucible of
Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Tehran Radio said 11 civilians were killed in the missile
attacks and the air raids on Dezful, Ilam, Borujerd and Kuhdasht.
   Iran said its artillery hammered ``military and industrial
targets'' in the southern city of Basra, shelled daily for more
than a month, and five other border towns.
   If the Iranian claim of a major advance into Kurdistan is true,
it would mark Iraq's worst military setback since the Iranians
fought to within six miles of Basra a year ago. Iran still occupies
land east of the battered city.
   The Iraqi army's Al-Qadessiyah daily, heightening the belief
that the Iranians have made gains, exhorted soldiers to ``pour your
rage and fire on the heads of the Persians who have gone too far.''
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said the Iranians ``fiercely repelled'' a counterattack by Iraq's
5th Army Corps around Lake Darbandikhan before dawn Monday.
   It gave no indication of further Iranian advances in the
13-day-old Val-Fajr-10 offensive.
   But it quoted Revolutionary Guards Minister Mohsen Rafiq-Doust
as saying in Tehran on Sunday night that his men have overrun 540
square miles of Kurdistan.
   IRNA also reported that Iranian jet fighters shot down two Iraqi
warplanes in the battle zone Monday.
   Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels said their National Liberation Army
launched a major offensive on a 14-mile front in Iran's oil-rich
southwestern Khuzestan province near the town of Shush.
   The rebels claimed in a communique that 15 brigades of its
fighters pushed into Khuzestan to drive Iranians out of positions
and threaten a key highway southwest of the garrison city of Dezful.
   It reported heavy Iranian casualties with ``a large number of
tanks captured.''
   IRNA said Iraqi soldiers and ``counterrevolutionaries,'' a usual
reference by the Iranian media to the rebels, launched a ``futile
infiltration attempt'' that was repulsed by the Iranian forces. It
said 1,000 attackers were killed or wounded.
   At the United Nations on Monday, Iraq condemned the world body's
sending a team to look into Iranian charges of chemical warfare and
asked it to instead investigate what it said was Iranian torture of
Iraqi POWs.
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said the United Nations was
ignoring Iran's own use of chemical arms and letting Iran drag its
feet in implementing a cease-fire.
   In the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy completed its 18th escort
mission of the year. Two Kuwaiti tankers reached international
waters off Kuwait after steaming northbound from the Strait of
Hormuz, the Pentagon announced in Washington.
   The United States placed 11 Kuwaiti tankers last year under the
U.S. flag to protect them against Iranian attack.
   Iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf to retaliate for Iraqi
raids on its oil intallations.
   Iranian gunboats Monday attacked the 337,733-ton Danish
supertanker Karama Maersk off the southern emirate of Sharjah,
setting it on fire, shipping executives reported.
   Three hours later, gunboats attacked the 219,287-ton
Norwegian-operated tanker Golar Kansai in the same area and set it
ablaze, the officials reported.
   No casualties were reported on either ship.
   Tehran communiques said the Iranians have pushed about 15 miles
into northeast Iraq and seized the eastern and southern shores of
Lake Darbabdikhan.
   They were reported to be within 3 miles of an important
hydroelectric dam on the southern end of the 10-mile-long lake.
   The facility supplies most of the power for the region and
Baghdad, 120 miles to the southwest.

<NOTE>Eds: New grafs 8-110 with allocation of Gephardt delegates</NOTE>

   Richard Gephardt quit the Democratic
presidential race Monday, saying ``we lost, no question about
that,'' but declaring his party can win the White House in the fall
only by picking up his populist economic themes.
   Gephardt, whose campaign faltered after his initial win in
Iowa's caucuses on Feb. 8, said he would file for re-election to
his House seat from Missouri.
   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challenged
the Democratic Party and called it back to its central role as an
agent of fundamental change,'' Gephardt said at an emotional
Capitol Hill news conference packed with journalists and
supporters, including many of his House colleagues.
   Gephardt had appealed to workers, farmers and the downtrodden
with his theme of ``it's your fight, too.'' He said his drive had
brought other candidates closer to his positions on trade and farm
policy and would result in a nominee committed to fight for
economic justice.
   ``That was our message and that is our victory. Now that message
belongs to all the Democratic Party. I am convinced that it is ...
the only way for us to win in 1988 and beyond,'' Gephardt said as
his wife clasped her hands and fought back tears.
   The Missouri congressman, also accompanied by his three
children, quipped, ``I haven't seen a crowd this large in a long,
long time,'' after entering the ornate caucus room and giving a
thumbs-up sign to his supporters.
   Gephardt predicted a Democratic nominee would be chosen from
among those now running but refused to throw his support to anyone.
He said he might make an endorsement at a later time.
   Gephardt's withdrawal left Jesse Jackson just ahead of Dukakis
in the AP delegate count.
   Most of Gephardt's delegates were shifted into the uncommitted
category with his withdrawal. But Missouri party rules mandate that
the at-large and public official delegates are redivided among the
active candidates when a contender drops out. That gave Jackson at
least six more delegates.
   Jackson now has 606.55, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
605.55, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 168.5
and uncommitted 515.6, according to the AP count.
   Asked to comment on Jackson's candidacy, Gephardt replied, ``I
believe Jesse Jackson can be nominated and I think he can be
elected.'' He turned down a chance to give advice to the party's
other front-runner, Dukakis, with whom he had engaged in sharp
exchanges of negative TV ads.
   ``Michael Dukakis has sure done a lot better than I did,''
Gephardt said. ``I don't think it's my place to tell him what to
do.''
   Gephardt attributed his failed candidacy to a lack of money and
said that when he was able to get his ideas across, ``we did
connect.'' But he added, ``I have no alibis. We lost, no question
about that.''
   Gephardt's wins in Iowa, South Dakota and his home state were
buried by disappointing showings in more than two dozen other
states _ including Michigan, where he had said he needed a
``Michigan miracle'' last Saturday to revive his campaign.
   With his tough trade stance, the six-term congressman might have
been expected to do well in a state heavy with unions and
automakers. But he failed to win labor backing and finished a
distant third in the Michigan caucuses, behind Jackson and Dukakis.
   Gephardt, a consensus builder in the House, found a niche in the
presidential race as an anti-establishment populist. He had a
well-honed message and an aggressive television campaign.
   But Gephardt, 47, was hampered by a chronic shortage of cash and
by continuing skepticism about his populist challenge to ``the
apostles of the status quo.''
   As chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Gephardt was hardly
a stranger to the establishment he so bitterly attacked during his
campaign. He was also vulnerable because of switches over the years
on issues ranging from abortion to Reaganomics.
   The well-heeled Dukakis ran pointed television ads, one showing
a man flip-flopping through the air and the other a list of
Gephardt's corporate contributors. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee not only attacked Gephardt on his changes of heart, but
adopted his same populist theme.
   After Michigan, Gephardt had only 167 delegates _ less than
one-third the totals amassed by Dukakis and Jackson and fewer than
even Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who didn't compete on Super
Tuesday.
   Last year, Gephardt's poll showings in Iowa had been in the
single digits until after Christmas, when he began running TV ads.
Among them was his famous ``Hyundai'' spot alleging that a $10,000
Chrysler K-car would cost $48,000 in Korea because of trade tariffs.
   Trade experts challenged the accuracy of the ad, but that didn't
dilute its impact in Iowa. The TV drive, combined with the
grass-roots network Gephardt had doggedly built over two years,
propelled him to victory in the Feb. 8 caucuses.
   Later that month, Gephardt won the South Dakota primary largely
on the strength of an ad charging that Dukakis was ``one of the
biggest tax-raisers in Massachusetts history and saying Dukakis'
idea of helping farmers was telling them to grow Belgian endive.
   Gephardt formally declared his candidacy on Feb. 23, 1987, but
he had begun campaigning more than a year earlier. His last
campaign speech was in Milwaukee, before Wisconsin Democrats whose
primary is Tuesday. ``All things considered,'' he told them, ``I'd
rather be back in Des Moines.''

raise fees to lift Louisiana out of a fiscal crisis blamed on the
sagging oil and gas industry.
   Roemer, who took office March 15, said his first round of
spending reductions would include layoffs. Administration
spokeswoman Sidney Coffee said the cuts would not be announced
before Tuesday.
   The legislation was adopted in a special five-day session
completed Saturday.
   After lawmakers finished their work, Roemer said the temporary
authority will be tempered ``by my compassion and good sense that
they (legislators) will be coming back in three and a half weeks to
look over my shoulder.''
   In addition to power to cut entire programs and close
institutions through June 30, the administration also won the right
to raise fees without public hearings or legislative oversight.
   The governor said he was aiming for $50 million in spending cuts
for the remaining quarter of the fiscal year and $22 million in fee
increases.
   Commissioner of Administration Brian Kendrick said budget
officials worked through the weekend to come up with a list of
proposed cuts to present to Roemer late Monday. ``We're moving as
fast as we can,'' he said.
   Kendrick also said work would begin on the new Louisiana
Recovery District, a commission created by the Legislature to
impose up to a 1 percent sales tax to finance bonds that would pay
off the state's $1.3 billion long-term debt.
   The commission cannot issue bonds or impose the 1 percent levy
until the Legislature drops the same amount from the current
four-cent state sales tax.
   The commission was set up to get around a provision in the
Louisiana constitution barring use of an existing source of revenue
to pay off a deficit. It also enables the governor to get around a
requirement that tax increases receive the two-thirds approval of
the Legislature.
   The administration will ask the Louisiana Supreme Court to rule
on the constitutionality of the plan. If it does not pass legal
muster, the state will use short-term bonds to finance the debt,
Kendrick said.
   Kendrick also said the short-term notes would be used to help
overcome the $200 million cash shortfall remaining for the rest of
the fiscal year ending June 30.

<HEAD>Libya Says It Will Withdraw Forces from Border With Egypt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOBRUK, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Monday he is
withdrawing Libyan forces from the border with Egypt but he did not
specify a time frame for the pullback.
   Such a move would represent a conciliatory gesture unprecedented
since Gadhafi's feud with Egypt began 16 years ago.
   The Libyan leader's announcement in this Mediterranean city 75
miles west of the Egyptian border followed a series of goodwill
gestures made by both countries in recent weeks.
   Gadhafi did not say how many troops Libya has along the border.
   ``I want to emphasize to the Egyptian people and army that the
Libyan eastern military zone (beside the border) will finally be
abolished,'' Gadhafi told a crowd of 2,500 gathered in Tobruk, once
a key British base.
   The ceremony marked the 18th anniversary of Britain's evacuation
of its military bases in Libya.
   Gadhafi said the border forces would be withdrawn ``without us
asking for anything in return from the Egyptian side,'' and he
offered to let Egypt verify the withdrawal.
   Gadhafi, who wore a bright red jumpsuit, paused repeatedly
during his 1{-hour speech as the crowd chanted ``Long live the
revolution!'' and anti-American slogans.
   Gadhafi also said Libya would not use force to undermine
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government or to pressure it to
renounce the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Egypt is the only Arab
country to have diplomatic relations with the Jewish state.
   But Gadhafi did say Monday that Egypt had ``abandoned'' the Arab
world when the late President Anwar Sadat signed the U.S.-mediated
Camp David peace pact with Israel.
   Western and African diplomatic observers in Libya called
Gadhafi's overtures an enormous change, but said they had been
expected.
   They said Monday's announcement reflected Gadhafi's confidence
in his position at home.
   In his speech, Gadhafi also discussed civil rights in Libya. He
said arrests should only be made through court order. Critics say
that under the current system, some Libyans are arbitrarily
arrested by revolutionary committees.
   In the past month, Gadhafi has made several moves to increase
human rights, including releasing inmates at a political prison and
calling for the abolition of the death penalty.
   The Egyptian-Libyan feud began in 1972 when Cairo rejected
Gadhafi's bid to merge the two countries.
   Egypt blamed Gadhafi for a series of terrorist bombings in Cairo
and other cities in 1975 and 1976, and the two countries fought a
five-day border war in July 1977. Both have maintained large
military forces beside the frontier.
   Gadhafi has ruled Libya since a military coup in 1969 overthrew
the monarchy.

   The government said Monday it has asked
the United States about a missing scientist said to have gone to
America with documents about a Taiwanese program for developing
nuclear weapons.
   The Foreign Ministry statement was the first public
acknowledgment that Taiwan was in touch with Washington about the
case of Col. Chang Hsien-yi, 45, deputy director of the Nuclear
Energy Research Center at the military-run Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology. He disappeared in January.
   ``Because many people believe Col. Chang is in the United States
this ministry has contacted the American Institute in Taiwan
several times on this event,'' the statement said.
   It said American agency told the ministry it had no information
on Chang's whereabouts but was investigating. The institute
oversees U.S. interests in Taiwan since diplomatic ties were cut in
1979, when the United States recognized the mainland Chinese
government in Beijing.
   Taiwan newspapers, citing sources they did not identify, claimed
Chang worked for the CIA and fled to the United States with secret
information about plans to develop nuclear weapons on Taiwan.
   In recent weeks, officials have repeated Taiwan's position that
it has not developed nuclear weapons. They say they do not know
Chang's whereabouts and are investigating his disappearance.

   George Bush on Monday picked up the endorsement
of Rep. Jack Kemp, who said of the vice president: ``He's earned
it.''
   The New York congressman, who withdrew from the race earlier
this month after disappointing showings in GOP contests, said his
endorsement of Bush was ``unequivocal'' and that he would
vigorously campaign for him.
   Bush said the endorsement ``means a lot to me'' and called his
former rival ``a rising star in the Republican Party nationally.''
   Kemp, appearing with Bush at a news conference as the vice
president began a three-day campaign sweep through Wisconsin, told
reporters that the subject of a possible vice presidential bid did
not come up in his talks with Bush.
   Bush, asked whether he had considered extending an invitation to
Kemp to join him on a national ticket, said such speculation was
premature.
   ``It's too early to get into the vice presidency question,''
Bush said. Commenting on his recent wins in Republican primary
races, Bush said ``the numbers are strong.''
   However, turning to the subject of Sen. Bob Dole's campaign, the
vice president said he did not want to say anything that might be
construed as an effort to pressure Dole to formally withdraw.
   ``I'm just going to keep on campaigning. Each person has to make
that decision on his own,'' Bush said.
   However, Kemp said that recent remarks by Dole, including a
speech earlier Monday in Washington, during which he thanked his
supporters, appeared tantamount to a withdrawal from the race.
   ``He talked in such a way to acknowledge his campaign has come
to a close,'' Kemp said. Dole had said last Friday that Bush's
nomination now seemed a ``foregone conclusion.''
   Later, Bush told an invitation-only rally in a high school in
Cedarburg, Wis., that ``I don't put too much stock in the polls,
but they do look good.''
   Still, he told his audience, ``I will not project an arrogance,
I will not project overconfidence.''
   He said Kemp's endorsement was ``good, because what we want to
do is to have this party unified, together, so we can whip the
Democrats.''
   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting my
brains kicked out in Iowa,'' Bush added. ``Everybody had me dead
and buried. We were resurrected right there in New Hampshire. So
people say now things are going pretty well for you, and they are.''
   Kemp said that at the time he entered the GOP race, ``I believed
I was the best candidate for Republican conservatives. The voters
believed otherwise.''
   Turning to the Democratic race, Bush expressed admiration for
the growing strength of Jesse Jackson.
   ``The man's racking up delegates, and that's how you get
elected,'' Bush said. ``What he has done is very admirable. He hung
in there. He's doing very well by taking his case out to the
people.''
   Bush said that despite the numbers on the Republican side, he
wasn't taking anything for granted.
   ``I don't want to project that it's all over,'' he said.
   Kemp told the news conference: ``The time has come for all
Republicans to unite behind this man who has been a fine and loyal
vice president.''
   ``As one involved in the friendly competition, he's earned it,''
Kemp said. Then, turning to Bush, Kemp said: ``You can count on
Jack Kemp in '88.''

<TEXT>
   An angry Gov. Evan Mecham took offense
during his impeachment trial Monday at a prosecutor's comparing his
actions to embezzlement.
   ``I resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence. I'm
insulted by it,'' Mecham declared, ignoring orders by Arizona Chief
Justice Frank Gordon to refrain from commenting beyond answering
questions.
   Gordon, who already had ruled the question irrelevant,
admonished Mecham again, telling him, ``I hope you believe the
rules are for you, sir, as well as everybody else.''
   Mecham responded hotly, ``I have seen no witness who has been
insulted as I have been.''
   The outburst came after House prosecutor William French tried to
compare Mecham's loan of $80,000 to Mecham's auto dealership from a
protocol fund to a bank officer ``borrowing'' money from a bank
vault and later replacing it.
   ``That doesn't make the bank official any less guilty of
embezzlement, does it?'' said French, citing Mecham's repeated
references to the fact that his dealership paid back the loan with
interest.
   Defense attorney Jerris Leonard objected, and Gordon sustained
the objection.
   Mecham, who began his second round of testimony Friday and
completed it Monday, is charged with misusing state funds by
loaning the $80,000 to Mecham Pontiac. The charge is the second of
three against him.
   As he left the stand, he suggested the Senate drop the third
count _ that he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan _ and judge him
right away on the first two.
   In response to a question from a senator on how he thought they
should proceed, Mecham said he wouldn't mind if they decided to
``call this game at the end of six innings'' and forget the last
charge.
   He cited the effect of the hearing on his April 21 criminal
trial on charges of concealing the campaign loan.
   Outside the Senate chamber, Majority Leader Robert Usdane, who
like Mecham is a Republican, said the chances of dropping the third
count were ``about as good as me going out and jumping off the
highest building I can find.''
   He called the loan concealment charge ``one of the most serious
allegations that was made by the House.''
   Mecham also asked that the Senate at least postpone hearing the
third count until after his trial. But Minority Leader Alan
Stephens said that's as likely as ``as Jimmy Carter being elected
president of the United States again.''
   In his testimony Monday, Mecham maintained the loan was secure
with his company and a good investment for the money, which
originally raised by his inaugural committee.
   French, in a series of hypothetical questions, suggested Mecham
felt the money belonged to him, not the state.
   ``Could you have used the $80,000 to put a swimming pool and
tennis court in the back yard of your house?'' he asked Mecham.
   ``I probably could have done it if I'd invited all of the
legislators and cabinet officers to swim once a month,'' Mecham
said with a smile. He then added, ``I shouldn't jest with you on
these ridiculous questions.''
   However, he conceded that under his theory he could have loaned
the money to his wife for whatever she wanted to spend it on as
long as it was paid back with interest.
   Mecham also testified he could not recall whether his then-chief
of staff, Jim Colter, or anyone else advised that the loan was
politically unwise.
   ``We're all good Monday morning quarterbacks,'' said Mecham,
``and everybody decided it was a stupid thing to do after the
fact.''
   The protocol fund was set up after a state law barred use of the
funds to pay off Mecham's campaign debts. The prosecution claims
the money became a public fund for state promotion. Mecham claims
it remained private for use at his discretion.
   The 63-year-old Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an
impeachment trial in six decades, in previous testimony denied a
charge that he tried to thwart investigation of an alleged death
threat on a grand jury witness.
   Besides the impeachment and criminal trials, Mecham also faces a
recall election May 17.
   In other developments Monday, jury selection began in the
political extortion trial of Sam Steiger, an ex-congressman and
former Mecham aide. He resigned after being charged with trying to
influence the vote of a member of the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles.

   Progress toward solving the dispute over
participation of U.S. contractors in Japanese construction projects
was reported Monday night as the two governments scheduled a third
day of negotiations.
   U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael B. Smith and Ichiro
Ozawa, deputy chief secretary of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
cabinet, agreed to meet again Tuesday after sessions last Friday
night and most of Monday.
   ``There has been significant progress but we do not yet have an
agreement,'' said Smith's spokeswoman, Kelly Winkler. Both Smith
and Ozawa planned to consult their governments before Tuesday's
talk, she said. The Japanese Embassy said the talks were marked by
both progress and continung problems.
   Ozawa arrived last week and started formal negotiations Friday
in hope of averting further U.S. reprisals for exclusion of
American builders from the multibillion-dollar Japanese public
works boom.
   Congress late last year barred Japanese firms from U.S.
federally-funded public works because of lack of reciprocal access
for American companies. During his White House visit in January,
Takeshita promised to seek a solution but negotiations on both
sides of the Pacific failed to produce it. The United States was
reported on the verge of initiating a formal unfair trade action.
   Ms. Winkler said Monday's progress came both in defining the
Japanese public works projects to which U.S. bids would be admitted
and in clarifying the bidding procedure.

<TEXT>
   A brother of former President Chun
Doo-hwan has been summoned for questioning Tuesday about a
multimillion-dollar scandal in a semiofficial development agency he
once headed, prosecutors reported.
   Kang Won-il, the prosecutor in charge of the case, and his
assistants said Monday that Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, and three of his
aides were to be questioned about the alleged embezzlement of up to
$14 million from the Seemaul (New Community) development program.
   Kang said investigators have uncovered evidence linking Chun
Kyung-hwan, a younger brother of the ex-president, with $9.3
million of the funds.
   Opposition leaders have called for investigations of other
members of the Chun family.
   Saemaul was founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural
development. Chun Kyung-hwan, appointed by his brother, headed the
agency from 1981 to 1987.
   He has been accused of using his position to obtain donations,
sell influence and divert government funds to invest in
profit-oriented projects.
   Prosecutors said that last week investigators found about a
dozen secret bank accounts the younger Chun used under false names.
   Scores of government officials have been questioned in the case,
but prosecutors said most would face minor reprimands and not
criminal prosecution.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam demanded Monday that the
investigation be expanded to cover all allegations of corruption
involving the administration of ex-President Chun. He was in office
from 1980 until last month when Roh Tae-woo was inaugurated after
winning the presidential election in December.
   ``The administration should not be allowed to terminate the
investigation of Chun Kyung-hwan's scandals,'' Kim said in
announcing his candidacy for next month's National Assembly
elections.
   Protests about the Saemaul case intensified after Chun
Kyung-hwan, using a false name, flew to Osaka, Japan, on March 18.
He returned to Korea two days later for questioning.
   The government probe of the scandal is seen by some political
observers as part of an effort by Roh to discredit the former
president and his supporters, who allegedly were attempting to
maintain power within the government.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with military
backing, promised during the presidential election campaign to root
out official corruption.

   Attorney General Alfredo Gutierrez
Marquez resigned after it was reported cocaine traffickers used an
airfield at his brother's ranch, a source at the president's office
said Monday.
   The source, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
said President Virgilio Barco accepted the resignation.
   Radio stations RCN, Caracol and Todelar had earlier reported the
attorney general's resignation.
   Both the president's press office and attorney general's office
had declined comment when asked about a report Sunday night by the
Intervision television news program. The report said a 5,000-foot
runway used by drug traffickers was owned by Libardo Gutierrez
Marquez, the attorney general's brother.
   The source in the president's office told The Associated Press
late Monday that in his letter of resignation, the attorney general
said his brother did own a farm that news reports said had a runway
used by drug smugglers.
   Caracol had said earlier the attorney general resigned shortly
after a confiscated drug plane was stolen March 1 from a military
air base and landed at the runway, but the later radio reports said
he quit on Monday.
   The government of Colombia has been at virtual war with drug
traffickers, who have killed a justice minister, an attorney
general, several judges, two newspaper editors and scores of
policemen and soldiers.
   Intervision said the runway in question was used by planes
belonging to Pablo Escobar, branded as a leader of the Medellin
cartel.
   The cartel smuggles most of the cocaine reaching the United
States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   The United States asked for extradition of Escobar and four
other men named as members of the Medellin cartel. Medellin, a city
in northwest Colombia, is where most of Colombia's purported drug
traffickers live.
   The runway is on a farm near Medellin next to property belonging
to Escobar, Intervision said.
   The army last year seized a twin-engine propeller plane, an
Aerocommander, used for drug trafficking. The plane was stolen from
an air force base on March 1 and landed at the runway owned by the
attorney general's brother, Intervision said.
   It said the air force tracked the plane by radar and strafed it,
other aircraft and hangars. Two days later, army bulldozers
destroyed the runway.
   News media have said the attorney general suggested that the
government try to reach a truce with drug traffickers.
   Last month, at a dinner with foreign correspondents, Gutierrez
was asked if he thought the government should try to reach a truce
with the drug traffickers.
   Gutierrez said that would be up to the president and that his
job is to follow the president's orders.
   The president says the government will not surrender in its war
on drug trafficking.
   In a raid last week on a country estate owned by Escobar, the
army said it found tape recordings linking drug dealers with
someone close to the attorney general's office. The army gave no
details.
   The Escobar home was one of five homes belonging to drug
trafficking suspects where the army in the last two months found
arsenals that include U.S. military assault rifles, submachine
guns, shotguns, pistols, ammunition, hand grenades, stolen license
plates and army and police uniforms.
   Two of the homes were raided Sunday, the army said in a news
release.

<HEAD>Group Claims Responsibility for Bombay Airport Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group calling itself the Organization
of Arab Guerrilla Cells claimed responsibility Monday for a gun and
grenade attack which badly injured an Italian pilot at Bombay
airport in India last week.
   ``We claim responsibility for the attack launched against a
group of Zionist pilots working at the Italian airline (Alitalia)
at Bombay airport,'' said a typewritten statement from the
previously unknown group, dated March 26.
   The Arabic-language statement was received Monday by Reuters
news agency through a courier service in mostly Moslem west Beirut.
   Last Friday, an Arabic-speaking man who gave his name as Abbas
Mohammed Ali Shahadi shot and seriously wounded an Alitalia pilot
aboard an airport bus.
   Bombay police said the gun jammed after three or four shots and
Shahadi jumped off the bus and tossed two grenades at two off-duty
policemen. The grenades failed to explode and the two officers
chased Shahadi and caught him.
   The Italian Embassy in New Delhi said police had not determined
the gunman's nationality or motive. Police said he gave them only
his hame and no identity papers were found on him.
   ``The attack was in retaliation for the frantic campaign waged
by the Zionists and imperialists against the Arab nation,'' the
statement said.
   The breakaway Palestinian faction, Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
hinted last month it would retaliate for a life sentence passed by
an Italian court on its leader, the notorious Abu Nidal, in
absentia.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, and a top aide
were convicted of a 1985 terrorist massacre at a Rome airport. The
lone survivor of the four-man attack, the only defendant in
custody, was jailed for 30 years.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge made creative use of the state's victims
compensation law Monday and ordered a heroin dealer with extensive
real estate holdings to pay $2 million in restitution toward drug
rehabilitation programs.
   Supreme Court Justice Lewis Douglass said he reached the figure
by multiplying the cost of drug rehabilitation by the number of
addicts Agapito Lopez could have supplied with the six ounces of
heroin seized when he was arrested.
   Douglass said in a telephone interview he believed it was the
first time a state law allowing restitution for crime victims was
used in a drug case.
   Defense attorney Frank Ortiz said he would appeal the order. He
argued that when legislators approved the restitution law, they
were thinking of crimes in which there is a specific victim, like
robbery or rape.
   He also argued that the law requires a hearing to be held for
any payment more than $10,000.
   Lopez, 44, was convicted in 1987 of drug sale and possession. He
is serving a 25-year-to-life sentence imposed by Douglass last year.
   According to the judge's calculations, if the six ounces that
were seized when Lopez was arrested in 1985 had made it to the
street, and each addict bought 20 bags of heroin, the six ounces
would have gone to about 900 addicts.
   Douglass said he contacted drug rehabilitation agencies to find
what the cost of the least expensive treatment would be and was
told it was $2,400 annually for outpatient care.
   He said he will ask Mayor Edward I. Koch to designate a drug
rehabilitation agency to receive the money.
   Lopez sold 2,200 bags of heroin to an undercover officer for
$26,000 and was arrested after the officer arranged for another
sale, according to Nancy Young, a spokesman for Brooklyn District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   At that time, officers confiscated the six ounces of heroin and
seized $440,000 in cash from his apartment.
   Young said Lopez owned at least three houses in two boroughs of
New York City and a car dealership and other real estate in Puerto
Rico.
   He also had bank accounts with $60,000. The district attorney's
office will seize the assets needed to meet the restitution, Young
said.

<HEAD>Jackson Says He Can Win; Gephardt Departs; Kemp Backs Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New graf 4 with ABC report that Dole to quit Tuesday</NOTE>

   Jesse Jackson said Monday he expects Democratic leaders to
embrace him as the nominee if he wins the most pre-convention
delegates because ``I would have earned it from the people.''
Democrat Richard Gephardt ended his candidacy, and Republican
ex-candidate Jack Kemp climbed on George Bush's bandwagon.
   As Democratic leaders wrestled with the implications of
Jackson's overwhelming weekend victory in Michigan, Gephardt left
the race for the Democratic presidential nomination at a Capitol
Hill news conference.
   ``It's been said the opera isn't over until the fat lady
sings,'' Gephardt said. ``Last Saturday in Michigan I think I heard
her walking to the microphone.''
   ABC News, meanwhile, reported that Republican Bob Dole was set
to drop out Tuesday. The report cited campaign sources, and could
not be immediately confirmed. Dole has acknowledged Bush is the
almost certain nominee, and had been expected to withdraw soon.
   One consequence of Gephardt's withdrawal was to edge Jackson
ahead of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the AP delegate
count by one slim vote.
   Most of Gephardt's delegates were shifted into the uncommitted
category with his withdrawal. But Missouri party rules mandate that
the at-large and public official delegates are redivided among the
active candidates when a contender drops out. That gave Jackson at
least six more delegates.
   Jackson now has 606.55, Dukakis 605.55, Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 168.5 and uncommitted 515.6,
according to the AP count.
   Gephardt was pushed to withdraw by a third-place finish in
Michigan's caucuses, far short of the ``Michigan miracle'' he
sought to revive a candidacy that blossomed in Iowa's lead-off
caucuses but was trampled in the South.
   Jackson and Dukakis both campaigned in Connecticut on the eve of
its primary. Gore campaigned in New York and was joining Jackson
and Simon at a debate Monday night.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, was hoping his neighbor
state would provide a victory sufficient to ease the pain of his
loss to Jackson in Michigan _ a loss that raised questions about
his candidacy and his abilities as a campaigner.
   At a junior high school in East Hartford, a black student asked
Dukakis why she should vote for him over Jackson.
   ``I am not running against him and he is not running against me;
we are running for the presidency,'' Dukakis responded, his answer
running so long that he concluded by apologizing.
   ``I'm sorry I'm making a speech instead of answering your
question,'' he said. ``I hope I've persuaded you. I don't know.''
   Dukakis borrowed a favorite Jackson subject, urging the students
to reject drugs. His wife Kitty told of her secret 26-year
amphetamine addiction.
   The governor was peppered with questions about Jackson but
declined to outline any differences between himself and Jackson
``because I've never done that.''
   ``I don't think the American people are particularly interested
in what I think of the other candidates and what they think of
me,'' Dukakis said.
   GOP front-runner Bush, confident of winning in Connecticut, the
state he grew up in, began a three-day campaign swing through
Wisconsin, the next battleground with primaries next week. Polls in
both states put Bush decisively ahead.
   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting my
brains kicked out in Iowa,'' Bush said. ``Everybody had me dead and
buried ... So people say now things are going pretty well for you,
and they are.''
   Kemp, the New York congressman who abandoned his conservative
candidacy two weeks ago, joined Bush in Milwaukee to offer an
endorsement.
   ``George Bush is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party
and has earned that nomination,'' Kemp said. ``The time has come
for all Republicans to unite behind this man who has been a fine
and loyal vice president, and to help him be the next president of
the United States.''
   Bush's remaining two rivals behaved as though their races were
over, even though they kept their candidacies alive.
   Dole, all but conceding the nomination to Bush, spoke to
campaign workers in Washington in what sounded like a last hurrah _
though aides said he wasn't ready to withdraw.
   He said the Republcan Party ``must cast off the restrictions of
privilege and class. We must offer help to those who need it. We
must support and defend civil rights.''
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, with only 17
delegates to show for a campaign that has spent $25 million, took
the week off.
   Gore, the Tennessee Democrat, spoke at a congressional hearing
in New York City on homelessness and met privately with Mayor Ed
Koch. Later he criticized Secretary of State George Shultz for
meeting with ``surrogates'' of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Gore said in a letter to Shultz he had ``damaged the essential
bond of confidence between America and the people of Israel.''
   Jackson campaigned in Connecticut and considered the possibility
other Democrats were confronting _ that he could be the candidate
with the most delegate votes and popular votes by the end of the
primary season in June.
   ``If by the end of California we have the most popular votes,
the most delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical and
proper,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV. ``If I win the nomination from
the people, I expect the party to embrace me, and to embrace those
principles.''
   He questioned the notion that party leaders, believing he cannot
win in the general election, might ignore his strength at the
convention and give the nomination to another Democrat.
   ``They would not have given me the nomination, I would have
earned it from the people,'' he said. ``There is no small group, no
electoral college that can give or take your nomination. If so, why
even have a primary. ... Let the people speak.''
   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk said, ``I wouldn't be a party'' to
a stop-Jackson movement
   ``I can't imagine that if he runs through the process and comes
out on top, they could take it away from him,'' Kirk said. ``I
would refuse to be part of that.'''
   Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright credited Jackson with
demonstrating ``remarkable support and surprising appeal. He is
saying things people thirst to hear.''

   Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan announced his
candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Monday with a swipe at Republican
incumbent Chic Hecht.
   ``If he was the kind of senator Nevada deserves, I would not
have made that decision'' to run, said Bryan, who is in the middle
of his second four-year term.
   The 50-year-old former attorney general has won praise for his
opposition to the government's proposed high-level nuclear dump at
Yucca Mountain and has held a wide margin over Hecht in polls taken
over the past year.
   Hecht, an upset victor over Democratic Sen. Howard Cannon six
years ago, accused Bryan of spouting empty rhetoric and added the
governor was trying to take credit for the economic benefits to
Nevada of the ``Reagan revolution.''
   Bryan urged Hecht to consider a lid of about $2.5 million on
spending, calling high-budget campaigns ``perhaps one of the great
scandals in America today'' and acknowledging he couldn't match the
$5 million to $6 million Hecht has said he could raise.
   Bryan plans to release a financial report next week that will
show he has raised $1.1 million so far.
   Bryan upset Republican Gov. Robert List in 1982 and was
re-elected in 1986 in a landslide over Patty Cafferata. At the
time, detractors said he would be merely a ``caretaker'' governor
while he prepared to run for the Senate.
   He was born in Las Vegas, graduated from the University of
Nevada-Reno and earned a law degree from the University of
California Hastings College of Law.
   Bryan served terms in the Assembly and state Senate before
becoming attorney general in 1978.

   Greece said Monday it rejected American
protests over a construction freeze at the four U.S. military bases
here while talks proceed on the future of the installations.
   Government spokesman Yiannis Roubatis said Greece stood behind a
September 1987 decision to ban new building and repair work for the
duration of the negotiations.
   Roubatis said U.S. Ambassador Robert V. Keeley this month
renewed a request that projects involving security and living
quarters improvements go ahead. He said Keeley cited a 1983
Greek-American operating agreement, arguing such projects didn't
require Greek authorization.
   Roubatis on Sunday confirmed Greek newspaper reports that State
Department officials in Washington had protested the freeze.
   Greek and U.S. officials are negotiating a new bases agreement
that will replace the 1983 accord after it expires at the end of
the year.
   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou has said a new agreement
must be approved in a Greek referendum before it is signed.
   The bases, two near Athens and two on Crete, have been operating
since the early 1950s.

   Iraq on Monday condemned the United
Nations' sending a team to look into Iranian charges of chemical
warfare and asked the world body to instead investigate what it
said was Iranian torture of Iraqi POWs.
   In an angry, 15-page letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said the
United Nations was ignoring Iran's own use of chemical weapons and
letting Iran drag its feet in implementing a cease-fire.
   The letter, delivered Monday by Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani,
indicated a hardening of positions on both sides in the 7{-year-old
war.
   Iran will send an envoy to New York for talks with Perez de
Cuellar this Wednesday and Thursday on implementing a July 20
Security Council cease-fire resolution. Iraq will send a
representative next week. The envoys have not been named.
   The resolution demands an immediate truce and return of
prisoners of war. The United States has urged the council to call
for a worldwide arms embargo to force Iran to comply with the
cease-fire.
   ``We ask you urgently and immediately to send a team to
investigate the situation of Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran,'' said
the letter.
   It said 10,000 Iraqi POWs are being tortured, brainwashed and
forced to fight against their country.
   It said an additional 20,000 Iraqis were missing in action and
7,000 more prisoners were registered with the International Red
Cross but were not accounted for.
   The letter criticized Perez de Cuellar and some Security Council
members for responding first to the Tehran government's complaints
about chemical warfare.
   It branded as ``biased and unbalanced'' the U.N. chief's
statement Friday condemning use of chemical weapons by Iraq.
   Iraq has been condemned by the United Nations four other times
since 1984 for using chemical weapons. Western military analysis
say Iraq has the biggest chemical weapons armory in the region.
   The U.S. State Department said recently that there was evidence
Iran may have fired chemical artillery shells into Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar sent a team to Tehran to visit hospitals and
investigate Iran's charges that Iraq used chemical weapons.
   The Iraqi letter did not confirm or deny use of chemical
weapons, but said Iraq had the right to defend itself.
   ``When each time Iran sends hundreds of thousands of people to
attack and kill us, can you expect Iraq to stand by with folded
hands when barbarians try to invade?'' it said.
   The letter said since the war began in September 1980, Iran's
use of chemical weapons has been documented _ ``But here there is
no question or quick response by the secretary-general to
investigate this or any aggression by Iran.''
   Aziz protested that last Friday that the United Nations only
deplored the ``war of the cities'' when Iraq fired missiles at
Tehran in retaliation for Iran's attacks on Basra and Baghdad.
   He said that Iraq has accepted the U.N. resolution for a
cease-fire, while Iran has not explicity endorsed it.

   Bob Dole, stopping short of quitting the
presidential race in what looked and sounded like a last hurrah for
his campaign workers, said Monday that the Republican Party should
``cast off the restrictions of privilege and class.''
   The Kansas senator made no mention of Vice President George
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, and left the
ballroom of a downtown hotel without talking to reporters. He posed
for individual souvenir pictures with some of his supporters.
   ABC News, citing sources in the Dole campaign, said Monday night
that Dole would drop out Tuesday. The report could not immediately
be confirmed, however.
   ``I have stated repeatedly ... if my campaign did nothing else,
it would make clear that our party would never practice the
politics of exclusion,'' Dole told 450 campaign workers and
volunteers.
   For the Republican Party to retain the White House, ``we have to
convince more women, more young people, Americans of every color
and ethnic background, the disadvantaged, the disabled,
independents and Democrats not only to vote Republican ... but to
become committed party members,'' he said.
   The Democratic Party ``has lost its sense of purpose and its
sense of direction ... in a mire of special interests,'' but still
only 32 percent of Americans identify themselves as Republicans, he
added.
   To become a majority party, the GOP must open its doors ``to new
legions of Hispanic voters, blacks, Asian-Americans and other
ethnic groups,'' as well as blue-collar workers, evangelicals and
other conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan, he said.
   ``We must cast off the restrictions of privilege and class. We
must offer help to those who need it. We must support and defend
civil rights,'' said Dole. ``Our leaders should not be timid about
discussing issues that affect the homeless and the hungry.''
   Dole, joined by his wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Robin, said
the purpose of the gathering was to thank his campaign workers and
to outline his vision for the future of the GOP.
   He joked at the outset that he ``stepped on my own story'' on
Friday when he acknowledged to reporters that his race against Bush
appears lost. Dole had told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``it's
probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican
side.''
   Mari Maseng, a Dole spokeswoman, said Monday's speech was the
last of three Dole planned to make to stress key issues in his
campaign: foreign policy, deficit reduction and the future of the
GOP.
   ``They're the three issues that have been most important to him
in the campaign and why he got into the race in the first place.
They're issues that he cares about,'' she said.
   Asked if Dole planned to withdraw, she said: ``He'll tell us
when he makes that decision.''
   Dole said that ``I think despite the prospect of tough
competition in the next few months, I believe a Republican will win
in November, but we must keep in mind that we've got a lot of work
to do.''
   ``No doubt about it, we've got miles to go before we rest and
before we become a majority party,'' he said.

   Two railroad buffs were charged Monday with
taking a locomotive on a three-mile joyride at speeds of up to 50
mph before it derailed and tipped over, police said.
   James Schroedl, 20, and Eric Hoyem, 17, were charged with
burglary and criminal damage to property, said Detective Richard
Obermaier. Police located them through a pair of eyeglasses found
at the scene, he said.
   ``We visited optical stores until we found one that remembered
selling them to Schroedl,'' Obermaier said. ``They were a unique
presciption. The kid's almost blind.''
   ``They are railroad buffs. All their lives they've talked to
railroad guys and they learned enough to start the engine and get
it rolling,'' he said.
   Joyriders boarded the 1,500-horsepower freight locomotive at a
Chicago and Northwestern Railroad yard late Saturday, said railroad
spokesman Fred Bloedorn.
   The 25-year-old locomotive, valued at $100,000 to $150,000, fell
on its side, and the pair got out and ran off, Bloedorn said.
Obermaier estimated damage to the engine and tracks at $320,000.
   Police found Schroedl in a hospital with a leg injury suffered
in the derailment. He directed detectives to Hoyem, a high school
student, said Obermaier.
   Obermaier said the joyriders also apparently smashed windows,
broke into the yard office and damaged computer equipment as they
searched for a key to the locomotive.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd said Monday Saudi Arabia
would pursue plans to bolster its defenses, dismissing veiled
Israeli threats to the kingdom after it bought intermediate-range
missiles capable of hitting any Mideast capital.
   Information Minister Ali al-Shaer quoted Fahd as telling his
Cabinet at a regularly scheduled meeting, ``Saudi Arabia will go
ahead with its ratified defense programs and will pursue its
Islamic mission and Arab duties.''
   Shaer said the Cabinet reviewed ``solidarity'' with the kingdom
expressed by most Arab governments after ``repeated Israeli threats
to strike at the missiles that the kingdom has bought to defend its
soil and sacred shrines.''
   Saudi Arabia confirmed last week it bought CSS-2 missiles, with
a range of 2,200 miles, from China, but said it would not put
nuclear warheads on them.
   It said it wanted to diversify its arsenal.
   The kingdom's shipping lanes have been menaced by spillovers
from the Iraq-Iran war. Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of aiding Iraq
and has made threats against the kingdom.
   The Washington Post said last week Israel might carry out a
pre-emptive strike against the missiles.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
Israel, warned that Israel had the reputation of ``not waiting till
potential dangers become a reality.''
   He was apparently referring to Israel's 1981 pre-emptive strike
against a nuclear reactor under construction in Iraq.
   Saudi Arabia, like most Arab countries, is technically at war
with Israel. Support received by Saudi Arabia after the Israeli
threats included a message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
whose country is the only Arab nation to make peace with Israel.
   The state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad in Abu Dhabi, capital of the
United Arab Emirates, reported Monday that Fahd would visit Egypt
on April 4 to discuss the Israeli statements with Mubarak. It
quoted diplomatic sources in Cairo.
   There was no official confirmation from Cairo or Riyadh.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista government and rebel
negotiators met for two hours in this border outpost Monday to work
out details for a 60-day cease-fire outlined in the peace accord
they signed unexpectedly last week.
   They are considering the areas where the rebels, known as
Contras, will gather during the truce, which is to begin April 1
under the accord signed Wednesday night.
   After about two hours of discussions, the talks were recessed
until Tuesday, and rebel leaders said there remained obstacles.
   High-level talks aimed at reaching a more permanent truce are
scheduled for April 6 in Managua, the capital.
   The talks were delayed by the late arrival of the Contra
negotiators, who entered Sapoa in midafternoon.
   Representatives from the leftist Sandinista government were led
by Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, deputy defense minister and army chief
of staff.
   ``We come with the same spirit, will and decision of the first
meeting,'' he told reporters.
   Leading the U.S.-backed Contras was Aristides Sanchez, a
director of the umbrella Nicaraguan Resistance alliance. He told
reporters the rebels presented their plan to the government and
discussions would resume Tuesday.
   Among the rebel representatives were Walter Calderon, a former
national guardsman now known as Commander Tono; Luis Moreno Payan,
who uses the name Commander Mike Lima and is chief of Contra
military intelligence; Luis Fley, or Commander Johnson, chief of
rebel operations in northern Nicaragua, and Diogenes Hernandez
(Commander Fernando) whose units operate in central Nicaragua.
   Hernandez told a news conference after the meeting, ``I want to
tell the Nicaraguan people and the world that the (rebel)
combatants are not going to put down their arms until Nicaragua is
a democracy.''
   He said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega proposed last week that
a Marxist democracy be established, but Hernandez said the Contras
want ``a real democracy like Costa Rica.''
   Cuadra declined to respond to Hernandez' remarks and said
Monday's talks dealt with the ``mechanics of the meeting.'' He said
the rebels made no proposals to define the zones where the Contras
would gather under a truce.
   ``We are hoping for an agreement before April 1,'' he added.
   A temporary cease-fire has been effect since March 21.
   Cuadra said there had been ``violations of the truce of a minor
character, but we understand that they are due to the
communications problem.''
   Sanchez said that in a few days the rebels will free the
Sandinistas they are holding captive. He did not give details.
   Others in the Sandinista delegation were Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco and military intelligence chief Maj. Ricardo
Wheelock Roman.
   On Sunday, the leftist Sandinista government fulfilled the first
part of the cease-fire accord by freeing 100 political prisoners
under an amnesty program. Most of them were accused of activities
linked to the Contras.
   Afterward, Interior Minister Tomas Borge called the amnesty
``possibly the beginning of the end of the (6-year-old) war.''
   After celebrating Palm Sunday Mass, Roman Catholic Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo called the prisoner release ``very positive.''
   During his homily, the Managua archbishop said the cease-fire
agreeement did not mean ``we have already reached peace.''
   ``Let us not make a mistake. Let us not confuse ourselves. They
have only signed a cease-fire,'' he said.
   Under the Sapoa agreement, rebel forces are to gather without
interference from Sandinista forces in specified zones inside
Nicaragua during the first two weeks of April. Monday's talks
between special commissions of the two sides could be extended and
were to define ``the location, size and modus operandi'' of those
zones, according to the text of the Sapoa accord.
   Nothing is said in the Sapoa agreement about the Contras laying
down their arms. In past talks, the rebels insisted on keeping
their weapons until all provisions of an accord were carried out.
   Once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones, the Contra
leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in
national reconciliation talks on April 6.
   Last week's pact provides a gradual amnesty for Nicaragua's
3,300 political prisoners; guarantees freedom of expression, and
permits all exiles to return home and participate in the political
process.
   If the peace plan is carried out, Nicaragua could become the
first Central American nation other than Costa Rica to comply fully
with the regional peace plan signed by on Aug. 7.

   House Speaker Jim Wright says he had no idea
that one of his own advisers had tried to sell weapons to Lt. Col.
Oliver North's secret Contra supply network three months before the
Iran-Contra scandal began to unravel.
   The speaker, who has long opposed military aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels and has been a leader in trying to achieve a negotiated
peace there, said he knew nothing of the 1986 arms offer by his
associate, Richard M. Pena.
   Pena, a former House Foreign Affairs Committee staff member,
contacted North's associate Richard Miller just three months before
disclosures about the Iran-Contra affair shut down North's
operation in November 1986.

   Jesse Jackson's win in Michigan has sent a
message to the Democratic Party that it can no longer ignore _ at
the rate he's going, Jackson just might wind up as its presidential
nominee this fall.
   Political analysts say Jackson's almost 2-1 victory over
erstwhile front-runner Michael Dukakis in Saturday's Michigan
caucuses is a clear signal that the preacher-turned-politician is a
very viable contender for the nomination.
   Jackson, treated as an also-ran in 1984, has won in eight states
so far this year _ Michigan, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Virginia, South Carolina, Alaska _ and in Puerto
Rico's non-binding contest.

   The ``attack ads'' of Super Tuesday have given
way to a gentler spring, but experts say the most pointed jabs of
the presidential primary season will be back this fall _ with a new

   ``History tells us that we're likely going to see Democrats
being quoted against the Democratic nominee and Republicans quoted
against the Republican nominee both in advertising and in

political campaigns and advertising. ``It's a classic move and this
year both sides are vulnerable.''
   The outbreak of tough television talk started in New Hampshire,

   Senate budget writers get their shot this week
at crafting a $1 trillion fiscal 1989 federal spending plan, an
exercise that normally causes fur to fly but this year should be
relatively tame.
   With 1988 an election year, a truce has taken hold in what is
usually a three-way budget battle among the White House and
congressional Democrats and Republicans.
   The reason is last fall's budget summit pact between Congress
and the administration, an accord that settled most of the fiscal
fights well in advance. Lawmakers are showing no inclination to
reopen the usually wrenching decisions about taxes and military and
domestic spending that the summit has already made.

his House seat from Missouri.
   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challenged

   Jackson overwhelmed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the

<HEAD>Asians Help Americans Cut Flow of Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Although saddled with drug
problems of their own, a number of Asian countries are extending
effective help to Americans trying to stem the flow of narcotics
into the United States, senior U.S. officials say.
   The United States regards Afghanistan, Iran, Laos and Syria as
patently uncooperative, but the officials say such countries as
Thailand, Malaysia, Burma, Pakistan and China, along with Hong
Kong, work closely with Americans in cutting Asian opium production
and tracking drug shipments and dealers.
   In March, for example, Asian-American teamwork led to the arrest
in New York City of an alleged drug baron the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) says may have smuggled up to $1 billion worth
of heroin into the United States.
   The trail of Kon Yu-leung, a high-living Chinese carrying the
passports of at least six countries, reportedly had snaked down
from the opium fields of the ``Golden Triangle'' of Thailand, Burma
and Laos through Hong Kong and on to the United States. The heroin
was hidden in shipments of innocent-looking vases, ice buckets and
T-shirts.
   Exchanging intelligence and tracking Kon and his syndicate for
four years were a special Thai anti-narcotics unit, the Royal Hong
Kong Police and some of the 80 DEA agents based in Asia.
   ``In this part of the world countries have acknowledged that
they too have an internal drug problem,'' DEA head John C. Lawn
said in an interview during a conference in Kuala Lumpur. ``They
are overt in cooperating so that something can be done not only
about the international problem but their domestic one.''
   Opium-smoking has long been a problem in Asia because of the
proximity of the drug. But Asian nations in recent years have
cracked down hard. Malaysia, for example, has the death penalty for
narcotics offenses.
   While the greater U.S. anti-narcotics focus is currently on
Latin America and the Carribean, the DEA has sharply revised its
estimate of Southeast Asian heroin consumed by American addicts
from 18 percent to 30 percent. An additional 37 percent is said to
originate from the so-called ``Golden Crescent'' _ Iran,
Afghanistan and Pakistan _ and the rest comes largely from Mexico.
   Also requiring shifts of tactics and possibly manpower is DEA's
assertion that Asian syndicates are replacing the Mafia as
wholesalers of heroin to American addicts, estimated to number
about 500,000. According to the DEA, about 70 percent of heroin
reaching New York City originates in Southeast Asia, up from 4
percent five years ago. Latin America is the chief source of
cocaine.
   The war against drugs in Asia works both ways. The United
States, for example, helped set up a network of drug rehabilitation
centers in Thailand that treat some 30,000 addicts a year. The
Thais in turn have forged a dedicated group of anti-drug lawmen who
each year arrest more traffickers and greater quantities of drugs,
much of them bound for the United States.
   ``We couldn't really operate without the Americans,'' said Col.
Viraj Jutimitta, widely regarded as one of Thailand's best
anti-narcotics officers. The United States supplies one of his
elite units, ``The Dirty Dozen,'' with radios, vehicles, travel
allowances and even copying paper.
   The United States also is providing aircraft and herbicides to
spray opium fields in Burma and Pakistan and has helped Thailand's
largely successful effort to get hill tribes people to substitute
coffee, vegetables and other crops for their traditional opium.
   The U.S. State Department spends about a third of its $100
million anti-narcotics budget in Asia, maintaining drug
coordinators in every embassy and 24 officers at special narcotics
units in in Thailand, Burma and Pakistan. Somewhat less than a
third of DEA's current $525 million budget is allocated to Asia.
   Cooperation, however, stops at the frontiers of war-torn
Afghanistan and politically hostile Iran and Syria. Opium and
heroin production in communist Laos is reported soaring with the
connivance of high-level authorities, but U.S. officials say there
is reluctance to impose sanctions for fear the Laotian government
will refuse to cooperate on the accounting of Americans missing in
action from the Indochina war in Laos.
   In contrast, China has moved to forge links with the
international anti-narcotics community which has detected new
trafficking routes across its vast expanses from the Golden
Triangle.
   Most recently, authorities in China, Hong Kong and the United
States got together to nab a ring attempting to smuggle heroin
stuffed inside dead ornamental fish. When the drug-laden gold carp
were discovered in Shanghai, Chinese police contacted American
counterparts. The fish were flown to their San Francisco
destination, along with a senior Shanghai police officer, and
subsequent arrests were made at both ends of the connection.
   Lawn said Thai-U.S. teamwork, which he rated as excellent, was
essential since Thailand was the main funnel for heroin pouring out
the Golden Triangle, which is formed by the rugged borderlands of
Burma, Laos and Thailand.
   American agents regularly tip off the Thais about suspected drug
carriers entering their country while Thai police officers have
followed traffickers to the United States to facilitate
investigations and arrests. Under a treaty now being considered,
the United States would channel a share of assets seized from
traffickers to Thailand's anti-narcotics program in cases where
Thai lawmen provided assistance.
   When U.S. sailors by the hundreds descend on Thailand's
anything-goes beach resort of Pattaya for shore leave, the two
sides activate operation ``Stable Boy.'' A DEA agent mingles with
the Americans while Thai undercover police shadow local drug
pushers.
   The leeway American agents have to operate varies among Asian
countries and there is invariably no power to arrest. But a number
of countries give DEA the green light to track traffickers and
joint operations are mounted. In 1986, a DEA agent on the Malaysian
island of Penang posed as a drug dealer to entrap a local
trafficker. When sufficient evidence was obtained, Malaysian police
moved in to make the arrest.
   In Thailand and the United States authorities are now after
traffickers behind what the Thais say is the world's greatest drug
haul: 1.4 tons of top grade heroin seized in February in Bangkok,
Thailand's capital.
   The drugs, concealed in bales of smoked rubber sheets, were
destined for New York City, where their street value, when cut and
diluted, would have been more than $2 billion.

<TEXT>
   When the sun goes down and the evening
breeze comes up, Luanda comes alive to an Afro-Latin beat called
batuque, nightclub doors swing open and Angola's 13-year civil war
fades away _ until tomorrow.
   The night, in this capital of 960,000 people south of the
equator, is for restaurants, discos, movie theaters, recreation
centers and pop concerts _ or even just watching ``Love Boat'' at
home on TV.
   But tomorrow always comes and one of the world's longest-running
``regional conflicts'' will be back in view again in the steaming
daylight _ the pro-Soviet, pro-Cuban and Marxist slogans on the
billboards and walls ... the troops back in battle again in the
southern countryside against the U.S. and South African-supported
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels.
   But the night is for none of that in Luanda.
   At the Kizombo Recreation and Cultural Center in the Golf
neighborhood, a ``sparkling'' tropical night show goes on to the
accompaniment of a group called The Kiezos.
   Tables are available only by advance reservation and they are
for couples only.
   At the Mae Negra (Black Mother) recreational center, a private
club in the Cuca neighborhood, four women and a man go through a
gymnastic dance routine to the throbbing beata of the batuque.
   After the performance, elegantly dressed couples fill the floor
of the cavernous pink, purple, red and blue center to dance to
African, Caribbean, British and American tunes.
   Between dances, patrons fill their plates at a buffet, which
comes with the $8.30 admission, of fish stew, salads, baked beans
and tifufuntila, peanut butter mixed with manioc meal and sugar.
   Cold local beer, colas and orange sodas go with it, but
champagne can be had if ordered a week or two in advance, the
locals say.
   At discos like the Caixote (Little Box), Flamingo and Adao,
bouncer-doormen size up prospective patrons, letting in the
subdued, the well-dressed and the well-known for free.
   The T-shirt crowd and the unknown usually end up back on the
street wondering where to go before the midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew.
   A recent pop concert at the Neves Bendinha movie theater sold
out before showtime with a seat going for the same $8.30 it cost
for an evening at Mae Negra.
   On the bill one recent night was an all-star Angolan roster
including Os Anjos (The Angels), singers Minguito, Cananito
Alexandre and Ze do Pau and the closing act of ``Bruxo e A Bruxa''
(the Male and Female Witch).
   The fare at Luanda's 12 movie theaters reflects a diversity that
contrasts with the government's public austerity program and ranges
from the expected Cuban, Czechoslovak, Soviet and Yugoslav films to
Jessica Lange's ``Frances'' and ``Lonewolf McQuade,'' a Chuck
Norris action movie featuring the Texas Rangers.
   For those who stay home, TPA, the state-run television, offers
``Love Boat'' in English with Portuguese subtitles at prime time on
Sunday night.
   Angola was a Portuguese colony for 400 years until 1975 when it
gained independence, and the Portuguese language is still widely
used.
   Even in the southern provinces, close to the war zone, the
atmosphere changes when the sun goes down.
   Across the street from the Hostal America in Kuito, capital of
central Bie province, some of the 40,000 Cuban support troops in
Angola as well as Cuban civilian doctors, teachers and nurses were
seen by visiting foreign reporters whooping it up at the local
recreaction center.

   SWISTTAL-HEIMERZHEIM, West Germany (AP) _ Bored with her office
job, Michaela Busemann went off to learn how to shoot a machine gun
and become part of an elite group of women breaking into an
all-male domain _ the West German border police.
   The police are responsible for guarding the country's borders,
including those separating West Germany from the communist East.
   They also provide security at federal facilities and airports,
run patrol boats along the coast in the North and Baltic seas,
arrest drug smugglers, and are deployed to help state police
control unruly demonstrators.
   Since the federal border police force was founded in 1951, only
men were permitted to join. But last year the government permitted
enlistment of women.
   On Oct. 1, 1987, 31 women chosen from a group of 1,000
applicants began 30 months of training at Swisttal-Heimerzheim, 12
miles west of Bonn.
   ``I was working in an office and it was boring,'' Ms. Busemann
said in an interview, ``so I joined the border police because this
is much more interesting.''
   Ms. Busemann, who is 20 years old, has her sights set on
completing the tough 30-month course, which includes handgun and
machine gun target practice.
   The recruits also regularly train in the martial art of jujitsu,
scramble through obstacle courses, and do required conditioning
sports such as swimming and long-distance running.
   In addition they have a full classroom schedule, including law
courses and other police-related subjects.
   Asked how she and the other women were accepted by the men, Ms.
Busemann said: ``At first there were a few funny remarks, but that
ended quickly.''
   Ms. Busemann is one of 29 women remaining from the 31 that began
the training.
   ``Two of them dropped out because they kept getting homesick,''
said spokesman Hartmut Ortlepp of Border Police Command Group West
in Bonn.
   He added that when the border police opened up for women
applicants in 1987, ``there were 1,000 applicants for the initial
30 slots offered.''
   ``We culled that down and finally started with 31 last
October,'' Ortlepp said.
   West Germany's constitution bans women from the regular military
services. Ortlepp said authorities at first had some reservations
about women becoming part of the 20,000-member border police forces.
   ``But when the women joined there was a very quick change. The
tone of the men has become more respectful, more courteous; it's a
change for the better,'' said Ortlepp.
   ``The average age of the women is between 20 and 21 and they are
more mature than the male recruits who average between 18 to 19.''
   Ortlepp added that political opinion would play a role in what
assignments the women receive, but those completing the course
would be considered qualified to apply for any border police
assignment or advanced training.
   That could include, he said, joining the GSG-9 anti-terrorist
commando squad, the most elite branch of the border police _ ``but
that's a political question.''
   In October 1977, GSG-9 commandos stormed a Lufthansa airliner
hijacked by Arab terrorists to Mogadishu, Somalia. The action
rescued 86 hostages aboard and resulted in the capture of one
hijacker and the death of two others.
   Whatever assignment they get, the women are still enthusiastic
about the prospects.
   ``It's fun, and there are a lot of new things to do and learn,''
said 20-year-old Heike Hartmann.
   A short distance down the forest road, where Ms. Hartmann and
the others were taking part in a field exercise, 21-year-old
Sybille Jakoby from the Saarland gave another reason for joining
the border police.
   ``I always wanted to do police work, but I couldn't join the
Saarland state police because their minimum height for a woman is
1.68 meters (5 feet 6).''
   ``But the federal border police minimum is 1.65 meters (5 feet
5) and that's exactly what I am.''

<HEAD>Thousands of India's Ancient Monuments Crumble From Neglect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of monuments and temples from
India's ancient past are neglected and forlorn, slowly crumbling
under the onslaught of time, weather and vandals.
   Even the Taj Mahal, the 17th-century ``monument to love'' that
perhaps is the best-known symbol of India's past, is in trouble,
its marble yellowing and cracking under the assault of fumes from a
nearby oil refinery.
   Decay and disregard also blight such famed monuments as the
domed, 12th-century temple to the Hindu Lord Krishna here in Puri
and the erotic temple sculptures of Khajuraho.
   Lesser known but historically no less important monuments suffer
even more.
   Hundreds of poor people make their homes or even keep their
cattle in Mogul tombs. Others cart away chunks of monuments to
build makeshift houses. Marble is scratched with uncaring visitors'
names, and peepul or fig trees sprout from cracks in ancient walls.
   Critics attribute the disrepair to a lack of regard for history
by most Indians, a large majority of whom are concerned with
day-to-day survival, and a lack of will on the part of the
government.
   Despite protests from environmentalist, the oil refinery still
operates near the Taj Mahal in Agra, the magnificent tomb built by
the Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan for his favorite queen, Mumtaz Mahal.
   But even at that, the Taj, which attracts 1.4 million visitors a
year, is the best preserved of India's monuments, with pollution
levels at least monitored and treatment applied to stained marble.
   The famous erotic temples at Khajuraho in central India are one
of India's main tourist attractions. But large parts of the temples
are covered with moss and algae, and hundreds of smaller statues,
awaiting transport to museums, lie exposed to the sun and rain.
   Of the 85 temples built in the years 950 to 1050, only 22
survive. Those are protected from vandals and treasure hunters only
by a single barbed wire fence.
   In India, the Archaeological Survey, a 125-year-old government
body, looks after 3,524 monuments of ``national importance,'' and
state governments are responsible for 1,500 other historic
buildings. But that still leaves thousands of sites, either ancient
or notable for artistic beauty, with no protection.
   ``We try to maintain what we have in the best possible
condition,'' said J.P. Joshi, the Archaeological Survey's director
general.
   ``We have helped them survive. Ninety percent of India's ancient
history is our contribution. We have worked hard and quietly.''
   But conservation enthusiasts, such as Abhishek Singhvi, vice
president of the Delhi Conservation Society, contend that the
Archaeological Survey and the states simply do not have the money
or qualified personnel to look after all the majestic remains.
   ``This is not a priority area and funding is a perpetual
problem,'' Singhvi said.
   The survey received about $12 million for monument protection in
1985-86, or an average of $284 a month for the maintenance, repair
and protection of each of the 3,524 monuments on the list.
   The conservationists maintain the nation as a whole has become
complacent about its history.
   At Puri, one of the four major Hindu pilgrimage centers, major
leaks appeared in 1966 in the dome of the temple to Lord Krishna,
but 21 years passed before restoration started.
   The work was blocked by the temple's own priests, who went to
court claiming that repair would anger the gods and cause the
temple to collapse.
   Local kings had covered the temple with thick plaster to save it
from the salty sea breeze about 300 years ago. In time, the plaster
began to absorb water, adding enormous weight to the dome, causing
cracks and making it vulnerable, said Guru Prashad Mohanty, the
temple's chief executive officer.
   The court rejected the priests' claims last year, and hundreds
of Archaelogical Survey workers now are chiseling away the old
plaster, exposing hidden statues and strengthening the temple.
   Not all efforts at restoration have such happy endings.
   In New Delhi, which is a composite of seven cities built by
different rulers dating to the 8th century, some monuments simply
disappear as modern neighborhoods overwhelm smaller tombs and
courtyards.
   Singhvi said a 1913 survey listed about 1,400 monuments in New
Delhi. Of these, 400 have vanished without a trace, most likely
torn down overnight by people putting up houses, he added.
   New Delhi, which is a federal territory and not part of any
state, has no law empowering it to take over monuments, and it must
depend on the Archaeological Survey for conservation.
   Singhvi and other conservation enthusiasts say one way to raise
money to save India's past is to raise admission prices at
monuments, maybe as much as five times current levels. He said
foreign tourists could easily pay 70 cents instead of the present
15 cents to see the Taj Mahal.

<HEAD>THIRD WORLD REPORT: Nigeria Tackles Health Care Deficiencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EVERETT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hardly a week goes by without reports in
the newspapers of outbreaks of diseases among Nigeria's 100 million
people _ yellow fever, measles, meningitis, tetanus, cholera,
polio, guinea worm and others.
   Hundreds of thousands die each year as a result of infectious
disease, malnutrition, poor sanitation and the lack of medical care.
   ``The majority of our people do not have access to health
care,'' said Dr. Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, the minister in charge of
health for Africa's most populous nation.
   Her task is to improve the health of Nigeria at a time when the
once-wealthy oil giant has been forced to drastically cut spending.
   Ransome-Kuti's approach to an array of problems is nothing short
of a complete reform of the health care system and his program has
won praise from the World Health Organization in Geneva.
   ``Our priority is to establish a basic primary health care
system,'' he said in an interview. ``If we can put that in place,
at least 50 to 60 percent of our health problems will be solved.''
   Previous administrations spent millions of dollars on large
modern hospitals for the major urban areas, but most never were
completed because of financial mismanagement and the country's
falling oil revenues, Ransome-Kuti said.
   Nigeria has joined a growing number of developing countries that
are switching from large hospitals to a decentralized network of
small health centers in rural and urban areas. The centers focus on
preventative measures to control diseases before they require
expensive hospitalization or reach epidemic proportions.
   The new program stresses mass immunization campaigns, oral
rehydration therapy for diarrhea, Africa's largest child-killer,
and nutrition, hygiene and family planning education. It also seeks
to provide cleaner water and human waste disposal systems.
   Nigeria's predominantly rural population is highly susceptible
to outbreaks of measles, typhoid, cholera, and other diseases
largely caused by a lack of clean drinking water and poor hygiene.
Many villagers are suspicious of modern medicine, preferring to
visit traditional healers whose treatments often aggravate health
problems.
   The World Health Organization in Geneva once assailed Nigeria's
health policies but now applauds them.
   ``Nigeria has a headstart,'' said the organization's
representative here, Samuel Brew-Graves. ``It has the leadership
and the know-how and is applying it.''
   About a third of the nation's local government areas have been
given 500,000 naira ($100,000) each to set up community health
centers. Ultimately all 304 local areas will be included in the
program.
   Both rural and urban areas suffer from a high infant mortality
rate _ 150 per 1,000 live births in rural areas. Three in 10
children die before age 5 in the urban areas, said a 1987 Health
Ministry report.
   As many as 2,000 Nigerian children die daily due to
malnutrition, chronic undernourishment and related health problems.
   Urban hospitals are rundown and underequipped to deal with the
cities' burgeoning populations. Basic drugs are in short supply,
and the country's lack of hard currency has made it difficult to
buy spare parts for medical equipment.
   Another major problem is the low morale of doctors in the civil
service. Many doctors in urban areas moonlight illegally to
supplement their meager salaries. Others remain unemployed rather
than work in the rural areas, most of which lack even rudimentary
health facilities or basic amenities for doctors' families.
   Ransome-Kuti said last year he might be forced to import doctors
from Cuba and still is keeping that idea alive, despite protests
from the Nigerian Medical Association.
   ``My aim is to get health services to the people. If Nigerian
doctors show unwillingness to serve, I'm willing to use health
personnel from any country,'' he said.
   Ransome-Kuti's younger brother, Beko, also a doctor, is vice
president of the medical association. He said there should be no
need to import doctors.
   ``If the amount of money spent on foreign doctors was offered to
Nigerians they wouldn't be short of people applying,'' he said.
   ``The government seems to think patriotism and nationalism are
enough to get people to the rural areas. Incentives need to be
given to attract doctors there.''
   But the health minister said it is in his plans to do that,
explaining that comfortable housing, electricity, running water and
adequate schooling for doctors' children will be provided in rural
posts.
   ``Once these services are delivered, the doctors will find their
place in the rural areas,'' he said.

   In 1682, the French explorer Robert La Salle reached the
Mississippi River.
   In 1833, the first tax-supported public library was founded, in
Peterborough, N.H.
   In 1939, some 75,000 people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington to hear black singer Marian Anderson perform after she

   For $2 or so, you can hungrily cradle a barrel
of popcorn while watching characters in ``Babette's Feast'' ravish
blini with black caviar, quail stuffed with foie gras and other
magnificent morsels in what has to be one of the most inspiring
meals ever shown on the screen.
   For $88 more, you can follow this feast for the eyes with one
for the body.
   ``One thing will happen after you see this movie: You will be
starving,'' said Dro E. Proudian, general manager at Petrossian
Inc., whose restaurant is one of several around the the country
serving the seven-course feast during the run of the movie,
Denmark's entry for an Academy Award as best foreign film.
   ``When you see the film, how complicated the meal is, how
expensive, all the marketing,'' there will be a greater
understanding of the art of preparing a great meal, said Yannick
Cam, chef and owner at Le Pavillion in Washington, which begins
serving the feast in April.
   The movie, based on a story by Isak Dinesen, tells of two
unmarried and pious sisters who take a French political refugee,
Babette, into their home on the bleak coast of Norway, in return
for housekeeping. Fourteen years later, when Babette wins 10,000
francs in the lottery, she repays them with a feast so strange to
them that one sister, in anticipation, compares it to a witch's
sabbath.
   But Babette fills the hearts, as well as the bellies, of her 12
guests, mostly members of the sisters' religious community.
   ``It was a whole experience, that's why we did it,'' said Stella
Geller of West Orange, N.J., who with her husband followed the film
with dinner recently at Petrossian. ``I didn't leave a bite of
anything. I ate every bite.''
   So far, plans have been made for the feast at restaurants in
Philadelphia, Miami, Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco and
Laguna Niguel, Calif., according to Alfred Rosenthal, Orion
Classics' gastronomic consultant for the dinners. Prices will vary
slightly, with $80 the lowest, without wines, he said.
   That will buy: turtle soup; blini with black caviar; quail
stuffed with foie gras baked in a pastry nest with truffle sauce;
salad; cheeses; rum cake with candied fruit; fresh fruit; coffee.
Add $35 for four wines.
   As the movie opens in more cities, theater owners and
restaurateurs can use a guide written by Rosenthal to help them
present the feast and find such ingredients as turtle meat.
   While the meal is expensive, Proudian called it a bargain,
noting the normal prices of just three ingredients: 30 grams of
fresh Russian Sevruga caviar ($21); 2{ ounces of fresh foie gras
($15); three-quarters of an ounce of black truffle ($30).
   ``The people who come here are adventurous, a lot of romantic
people,'' Proudian said in a recent interview at Petrossian, a
mirrored and marbled restaurant near Carnegie Hall.
   To meet their expectations and recreate the sense of abundance
evident on Babette's table, he said, ``the caviar has to be
heaping, you have to see the truffles, not just a speck here, a
slice there. When you put your knife into the quail, you have to
feel the foie gras.''
   ``It was extraordinarily difficult, because we had to recreate a
visual image on a plate,'' he said.
   Petrossian's chef, Michel Attali, said he encountered one
problem. In the film, the quail is served sitting in its pastry
nest with the head on. Believing that would not be acceptable here,
Attali fashioned pastry ``heads'' for the tiny game birds.
   But no matter how faithful, diners will not experience the same
mood as in the film, Cam said: ``First the house in the film, and
it was a little religious dinner. I don't think we can reproduce
that.''
   Still, Proudian said, ``The star of the movie is the food. So if
you are in this business, it's nice to see all of this dignity and
respect given to the preparation of food.''

<HEAD>`French France' Candidate Makes Inroads in Presidential Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMIENS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whipping up the crowd of 1,500 supporters,
Jean-Marie Le Pen paints a picture of a decadent, declining and
endangered France, a Tower of Babel overrun by North African
immigrants, perhaps even becoming an Islamic republic.
   What he has been campaigning for in the presidential elections
April 24 is a ``French France.''
   The first man to announce his candidacy, Le Pen has been
pounding out that message for a year.
   As the balloting draws nearer, Le Pen's message is being heard
and his prediction that immigration will be a key campaign issue
appears to be coming true. Two main conservative candidates have
picked up on it, but not to Le Pen's extremes, in hopes of winning
over his followers in runoff balloting May 8.
   ``Today we are in great danger,'' Le Pen told his audience in
this Communist-controlled town in the northern Picardy region.
France is suffering ``a demographic loss, a moral loss, a religious
loss ... and when you lose the instinct for life, you condemn
yourself to death.''
   Like a fire and brimstone preacher, the ruddy, silver-haired
Breton uses his considerable oratorial skills to shock, taunt,
cajole his listeners. Then he homes in on his favorite fears _
immigration, insecurity, drugs, AIDS _ and extols his favorite
virtues _ God, family and France.
   ``The renaissance of France must come through drastic
measures,'' said the 59-year-old fisherman's son.
   If elected, Le Pen says, he will amend the constitution to allow
for referendums on social issues for France's 55 million people,
then hold a vote to send large portions of non-European immigrants
home, reinstitute the death penalty for drug traffickers and
terrorists, and quarantine AIDS victims.
   Critics charge that Le Pen, a one-time paratrooper in Indochina
and Algeria, is a fascist, racist and anti-Semite _ which he denies
_ and that his National Front encourages xenophobia.
   Although running fourth in opinion polls, which give him about
10 percent of the vote, Le Pen has become an important electoral
factor.
   President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, is favored for
re-election, consistently garnering about 38 percent in the opinion
polls for the first round of balloting April 24. That kind of
turnout for Mitterrand, however, would mean he'd have to face a
runoff May 8 against the top conservative candidate.
   Thus for the divided right, Le Pen can be a spoiler.
   Both of the two main conservative candidates, Premier Jacques
Chirac of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, and former
Premier Raymond Barre, backed by the center-right Union for French
Democracy, need Le Pen's voters in the runoff.
   Chirac and Barre, who until recently shunned Le Pen's
controversial themes, began addressing the issues in March on
visits to the heavily-immigrant Mediterranean port of Marseille in
the heart of the National Front's southern stronghold.
   ``No one has ever reproached me for being xenophobic or
racist,'' Chirac told a crowd March 10. But ``developments which we
have recently witnessed have led a certain number of our citizens
to feelings of this kind. If I cannot condone it, I can understand
it.''
   On March 24, Barre told a crowd of about 10,000: ``The national
interest consists firstly of effectively stopping non-European
immigration. Not for reasons of principle but because of economic
and demographic circumstances. ...
   ``To me, what we must do appears clear: respect human rights but
at the same time defend the national interest.''
   About 4.5 million foreigners live in France, of whom 1.5 million
are Moslem Arabs from the North African nations of Algeria, Tunisia
and Morocco. The remainder are people of European descent and
blacks from France's former African colonies.
   Immigrants have become a sensitive subject as the nation
outgrows its need for cheap foreign labor. An attempt to revise the
nationality code to make it more difficult for immigrants to become
French was dropped at the approach of elections.
   Le Pen founded the National Front in 1972, but its political
awakening did not come until 1984 when the party took 11 percent of
the vote in elections for the European Parliament and seated 10
deputies, the same number as the Communists. Its entree into
national politics came in the March 1986 legislative elections
which gave the National Front 35 seats in France's National
Assembly.
   Le Pen says he will wait until May 1 to tell his supporters how
to vote, or whether to vote, in the runoff.
   However, he insists he still has an ``outsider's chance'' of
being the top conservative vote-getter April 24.
   ``I don't believe in the polls,'' he said. ``People don't dare
say they'll vote for us. They're afraid.''

<HEAD>At Tivoli Park, Spring's Chores Begin: `25,000 Violets and ...'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Wherever there's a little spot for
a flower, there's a flower,'' Owe Bodentien was saying, as he stood
on the muddy soil of a deserted Tivoli park, where he is the head
gardener.
   Like gardeners everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere this time
of year, his work is just beginning _ and he has 20 acres to worry
about.
   ``The policy is to have something new and something old, but not
too much of each,'' Bodentien said of his 10 years in what he calls
``the best gardening job in Denmark.''
   ``First we plant about 25,000 to 30,000 violets and
forget-me-nots in blue, pink and white, with tulips in between.
People should do that in their gardens, too, because when the
(tulip) bulbs are finished, you have another flower underneath.''
   Although the park is open barely a third of the year, as many as
5 million people stream through each summer season for the
amusement rides, the food, the music, the theater _ or just to look
at the flowers.
   Entrepreneur Georg Carstensen got royal permission to found the
park in 1843. The story goes that he told King Christian VIII,
``When people are amusing themselves, they do not think about
politics.''
   For many who visit Tivoli, the gardens are the main attraction.
   Bodentien makes a regular buying trip to the Keukenhof gardens,
showcase of the Dutch flower bulb industry outside The Hague in the
Netherlands. Tivoli buys practically all its flowers from such
specialized suppliers, spending the kroner equivalent of $313,000 a
year on plants alone.
   By modern amusement park standards, Tivoli is tiny, so every
inch counts. The garden plan has 10 pages of ledger-sized entries
detailing what is planted where.
   This year's plan calls for 68,000 tulips of 100 different
varieties, from ``Dreaming Maid'' to ``Black Hero.''
   The gardening staff of nine, which expands to as many as 17 in
the summer, will also be tending 42,300 pearl hyacinths and
anemones, 3,800 narcissi and Easter lilies, 50,000 cut
chrysanthemums and 100,000 potted plants of other kinds.
   January and February is the time for pruning trees, some of
which are older than the park itself.
   ``I must admit that trees are my big passion,'' Bodentien said.
``Flowers are easily bought, but trees take centuries.''
   Tivoli's chestnuts, elms and lime trees are seldom felled, and
when they must be, they are replaced. They grow from walls, poke
through restaurant ceilings and stick up around the winding tracks
of the rides.
   Tivoli's lone California redwood, a gift from the Danish
Brotherhood in California in 1968, is growing at the northern limit
for the species, Bodentien said.
   An American tourist was astonished to see a banana tree bearing
fruit in this northern latitude, he said.
   ``I heard him tell his wife it was plastic, so I picked one and
gave it to him to eat.''
   Bodentien and his crews are in a rush now to have everything in
order and in bloom by opening day, April 27.
   In 1983, Bodentien won a Guinness Record Certificate for the
biggest chrysanthemum display, 370,000 blooms. He's always coming
up with new ideas for the park's designs.
   ``I get my inspiration all over,'' he said. ``At home in a chair
or out walking on the street or maybe talking to people about
something totally different, and suddenly it comes. ...
   ``The park has to look as fine on the last day (of the season)
as on the first day. We are changing all the time.''

<HEAD>Mexico Using Novel Approach to Combat AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarmed by the fast spread of AIDS in the
country, Mexican authorities have begun a campaign called Cascade
Education, a novel approach that enlists those most likely to be
afflicted to spread the word.
   The campaign is aimed directly at male and female prostitutes,
the homosexual community, street gangs and the poor in the hope
that what they learn about AIDS prevention will ``cascade'' down to
others in their own vernacular.
   Most of the effort is concentrated in Mexico City, a metropolis
of 18 million people, where high-risk people are hard to reach
through newspapers and other standard means.
   ``We are teaching them to become health care promoters and
sending them into their communities,'' said Dr. Glorias Ornellas
Hall, director of the National Center for AIDS Information, an arm
of the federal Public Health Department.
   ``We believe that using the media to give information is not
enough to change behavior patterns. Only face-to-face contact can
do that,'' she said. ``The best way is for them to reach their own
communities in their own language. That includes prostitutes
reaching out to prostitutes, homosexuals to homosexuals, even
deaf-mutes to deaf-mutes.''
   According to the center, Mexico had 1,126 confirmed AIDS cases
as of Feb. 1, and the number is doubling every seven months. For
every confirmed case, an additional 50 to 100 people are becoming
exposed to the virus, said Dr. Jaime Sepulveda Amor, the
department's director of epidemiology.
   Sepulveda, who is also president of the government's National
Commission on AIDS Prevention, estimated during a recent interview
the number of people confirmed to have AIDS will reach over 25,000
by 1991, making it the second or third leading cause of death for
people in the 25 to 44 age group in Mexico, which has a population
estimated at 81.7 million.
   In the United States the number of AIDs cases reported since
June, 1981, has reached 57,024.
   Since it was founded last year, the information center has
broadcast its services on radio and television and through bumper
stickers, posters, keychains and matchbooks with condoms attached.
Mexico recently received a donation of 10 million condoms from the
U.S. Agency for International Development.
   Th center also has trained dozens of Mexico City residents in
its Cascade Education program, offering instructional rclasses but
leaving the actual teaching process to each individual.
   ``We give them the basics, then leave the style of presentation
in their own hands,'' Ornellas said.
   The center's staff also trains street-gang leaders and visits
jails to teach police officials and prisoners.
   Ornellas said many of the Cascade volunteers from the streets
originally visited the center to be tested for the AIDS virus and,
with counselling and support, have joined the program. She said the
best of them are those who have tested positive.
   One male prostitute in the program, only known by his nickname
of Jaimito, regularly visits Mexico City markets to sing a
``ranchero'' song he wrote and recorded called, ``What is AIDS?''
   Ornellas called Jaimito ``one of our great promoters.''
   A deaf mute who also is a male prostitute is another is Cascade
promoter.
   ``He uncovered a whole sub-culture of deaf mutes who prostitute
themselves off to make a living,'' Ornellas said. ``We found that
many feel they have no other way to earn money.''
   An initial Health Department survey indicated that about 30
percent of the male homosexual community in Mexico City has been
exposed to the AIDS virus. Gerardo Ortega Zurita, a Cascade
volunteer leader, said cultural prejudices have made it very
difficult for homosexual men to seek help.
   ``There's incredible discrimination against homosexuals, who are
isolated from the centers of the country,'' Ortega said. ``Teaching
them about AIDS is difficult. They are forced to hide from the
police and other government authorities.''
   Ortega brings youths from what he calls ``controlled groups'' of
prostitutes to the center to be examined and learn about AIDS
prevention.
   ``But there are others we can't get to, who are more preoccupied
with making a living than with taking care of their lives,'' he
said.
   Ornellas and other health officials say the Cascade approach is
essential not only in reaching previously hidden subcultures but in
confronting many myths about AIDS.
   ``We've come across many beliefs,'' Ornellas said. ``Some say
AIDS is punishment from God, and others, that witchcraft can ward
it off. In a country with cultural setbacks that include religious
beliefs, ignorance and cultural taboos that do not allow the use of
condoms, we found that this program has worked.''
   Currently, Ornellas said the center is receiving 50 visits and
100 telephone queries a day from people wanting to find out about
AIDS.
   ``It's new that they should come out at all,'' she said.
   ``The very lowest class is the most at risk, and the hardest to
get to. There's a disrespect for life (among them); they don't care
if they die.''
   As in other countries in Latin America, the center had to
overcome initial resistance from the Roman Catholic Church in
distributing literature and promoting the use of condoms.
   Clerics are one way of reaching rural areas, Ornellas said.
   ``We haven't even started with rural people, where you have
whole families living in a single room. Children learn about sex in
one room. What's going to happen when AIDS reaches these rural
areas?''

<HEAD>Riders of Kenya's Commuter Buses Leave Their Fate with the Gods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the thousands of small commuter
buses that careen about Kenya every day carries an appropriate
bumper sticker: ``You never know, heaven could be nearer than
home.''
   Authorities say the overcrowded, poorly maintained, wildly
driven buses called ``matatus'' have contributed heavily to Kenya's
highway death toll of nearly 200 so far this year.
   At that rate, the toll is roughly on pace with 1987 when 1,889
people died in traffic accidents _ or one person killed for every
166 cars on Kenya's roads. A similar rate in the United States
would mean that annual highway fatalities, now fewer than 50,000,
would reach more than 1 million a year.
   The privately owned matatus carry such names as ``Survival of
the Fittest'' and ``Living Devil.''
   Scary as it all may be, the poor people who use them have no
other choice.
   The brightly colored vehicles are legally allowed to carry no
more than 25 passengers. But usually matatu crews cram in twice
that many or more to get more fares. Those who can't fit inside
climb onto the roof and cling to luggage as the buses go into a
list on high-speed turns.
   Thirty-one people were killed Feb. 29 in a three-matatu crash
that incensed a nation already accustomed to headlines screaming of
``horror smashes,'' and ``matatu madness.''
   For days after the crash, newspapers printed pictures of victims
strewn across the road and of the crumpled matatus.
   Commentaries called for something to be done about matatus, and
a road-safety program was reintroduced on the government's Voice of
Kenya television.
   The head of the Matatu Association of Kenya resigned rather, he
said, than be ``cursed by the innocent blood of the commuters who
die daily on our roads at the hands of reckless matatu drivers.''
   President Daniel arap Moi, whose government in 1984 passed the
first legislation aimed at controlling matatus, decided they had
become more ``an agent of death and destruction than an asset to
the commuter.''
   Police began a crackdown, netting hundreds of unroadworthy and
overcrowded vehicles. Matatu crews, as well as unseated passengers,
were hit with heavy fines.
   The Ministry of Transport issued a new and more stringent list
of regulations and ordered all matatu drivers retested.
   But the matatu industry retaliated with a strike that stranded
hundreds of thousands of people. Moi rescinded the retesting order,
and the matatus returned after a day off the roads.
   Moi's response to the strike underscored the matatu industry's
stranglehold on the nation's transportation sector.
   Less than 1 percent of Kenya's 22 million people own cars and
fewer than 600 buses are on the roads. The lack of vehicles leaves
a demand for transportation met by the tens of thousands of
matatus, which mostly are vans and minibuses, that travel even the
most rural routes.
   Matatus first appeared as pirate taxis in the mid-1950s when
Kenya was a British colony and movement by the native population
was restricted.
   The industry burgeoned after independence in 1963 when
restrictions were lifted and people were allowed to move to the
cities, swelling metropolitan populations and increasing the need
for public transport.
   The name matatu comes from the Kikuyu term ``mang'otore
matatus,'' meaning 30 Kenyan cents, which at that time was the
standard matatu fare.
   Today, the average fare around Nairobi is 3 shillings (19 U.S.
cents) and routes are flexible.
   To increase profits and their own $40 to $75 monthly salaries,
matatu crews overload the buses, work overly long hours at the
wheel and drive at high speeds in order to meet daily quotas set by
matatu owners.
   At least 80 percent of the matatu crews work seven-day weeks and
average 10 hours a day in vehicles that suffer most often from
engine, brake or gear-box failure, according to a 1982 study by the
Nairobi-based Mazengira Institute.
   Many drivers admit to chewing khat, a stimulative twig, or
smoking marijuana to keep themselves alert.
   In one of the dozens of commentaries on matatus, a columnist for
the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper, blamed ``greed,
brainless bravado and showmanship'' for the road carnage caused by
matatus.
   ``The nation should not allow lunatics to ply the roads any

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Academy Awards ritual returns to an ancient
venue with a wide-open contest among nominated performers. Cher?
Glenn Close? Sally Kirkland? Will Michael Douglas win the Oscar
that has eluded his father? It'll all be settled Monday night on
the stage of the cavernous Shrine Auditorium.

   Oscar moves to a new-old location Monday
night for the 60th Academy Awards, which are expected to be
dominated by ``The Last Emperor,'' Bernardo Bertolucci's epic of
modern China.
   The venerable Shrine Auditorium, where the awards were presented
in 1946 and 1947, will again be the site of Hollywood's grandest
affair. ``The Last Emperor'' has been labeled the favored picture
at the ceremonies, especially since Bertolucci won the Directors
Guild award. The directors have proven uncanny in presaging the
Oscars, deviating only three times in 40 years.
   ``Broadcast News'' was an early favorite, but its vogue seems to
have faded. ``Moonstruck'' has proven extremely popular at the box
office and could stage a surprise victory. Less likely are the
other two nominees, ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Hope and Glory.''
   The nominated performances afford a wide-open contest,
particularly among the actresses. Both Cher (``Moonstruck'') and
Glenn Close (``Fatal Attraction'') have their champions, as does
Sally Kirkland (``Anna''), who collected several critics' awards.
Also nominated are Holly Hunter (``Broadcast News'') and Meryl
Streep (``Ironweed'').
   Michael Douglas delivered two strong performances in 1987 in
``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Wall Street,'' the latter bringing his
nomination. He might well win the Oscar, a feat that has eluded his
father Kirk.
   Marcello Mastroianni (``Dark Eyes'') might be honored for his
long, distinguished career. Then again, Academy voters might
finally recognize comedy and reward Robin Williams for ``Good
Morning, Vietnam.'' Also nominated are previous winners Jack
Nicholson (``Ironweed'') and William Hurt (``Broadcast News'').
   The supporting performance categories are equally impressive.
For supporting actress: Norma Aleandro, ``Gaby''; Anne Archer,
``Fatal Attraction''; Olympia Dukakis, ``Moonstruck''; Anne Ramsey,
``Throw Momma from the Train''; Ann Sothern, ``The Whales of
August.''
   For supporting actor: Albert Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Sean
Connery, ``The Untouchables''; Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart'';
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck''; Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''
   Among the directors, Bertolucci appears the solid favorite.
Other probables: Louis Malle's ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' for
foreign language film and ``(I've Had) The Time of My Life'' from
``Dirty Dancing'' for original song.
   The 60th Academy Awards have proven remarkably free of
controversy, at least in the nomination stages. The one
eyebrow-raiser was the failure to nominate James L. Brooks as best
director for ``Broadcast News.'' Since Brooks wrote, directed and
produced the film that was nominated for best picture and for three
of its actors, how could his direction go unmentioned? Another
Academy mystery.
   Monday night's ceremonies will be televised (ABC-TV, 9 p.m. EDT)
from the stage of the Shrine Auditorium, an ancient cavern a few
blocks from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The move from the
marble and crystal Los Angeles Music Center might seem like a step
backward, but the Academy governors had their reasons.
   For years, producers have smarted over the limited rehearsal
time afforded by the Music Center, which also houses symphonies and
operas. Also, the limited seating capacity of 3,400 didn't allow
the Academy to accommodate members' requests for tickets.
   The Shrine holds 6,308, and at $150 for the best seats and $300
for the Board of Governors Ball in the adjacent exhibition hall,
the event can supply much-needed funds for the Academy.
   Oscar has wandered over a large portion of Los Angeles County
during 60 years. The first event was held on May 16, 1929, in the
Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The 270 film
industry leaders who attended paid $5 a head to dine on squab and
lobster _ no booze in those Prohibition times.
   For the next 14 years, the golden statuettes were presented at
relatively intimate industry dinners in two hotel ballrooms _ the
Ambassador's Coconut Grove and the Biltmore Bowl. Old-timers view
those events with great nostalgia; they were warm, friendly
gatherings during an era when Hollywood had a sense of community.
   The war changed that. In 1944, formal dinners seemed incongruous
with wartime austerity. The dinners were abandoned for the
Grauman's Chinese theater, which could accommodate servicemen
guests with its 2,258 capacity. No black tie or formal gowns,
either. They were considered unpatriotic.
   After three years at the Chinese, the Academy sought a bigger
house, moving to the Shrine Auditorium. Then in 1949 came the nadir
of Oscar's fortunes.
   From the beginning of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, the major studios supplied financing. Then, in 1949, amid
claims by some critics that the studios were upset by the Academy's
frequent rewarding of European films, the studios withdrew their
support. They claimed they did so to avoid criticism that they
overly influenced voting.
   Totally broke, the Academy was forced to present the 21st awards
in its own 985-seat screening theater, once a neighborhood movie
house. The studios resumed their support, and for the next 11 years
the awards were presented at the art-deco Pantages theater on
Hollywood Boulevard.
   Seeking greater capacity, the Academy Awards moved out of Los
Angeles for the first time in l961, settling into the Santa Monica
Civic Auditorium for the next eight years. The location a couple of
blocks from the Pacific prompted Bob Hope to comment: ``The losers
can walk into the ocean.''
   In 1969, Oscar began a 20-year run in the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion of the Music Center. Now the awards follow the Grammys to
the Shrine, which also attracted this year's Emmys from their
longtime base at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.

   If the Academy Awards had been given in
December instead of April, the winner might well have been
``Broadcast News.''
   That's the way it looks to this Oscar-watcher. James L. Brooks'
funny, insightful look at the madness of the television news
business was the talk of Hollywood. But after a few weeks the talk
diminished, and ``Broadcast News'' did not become the box-office
smash that some had predicted.
   Suddenly ``The Last Emperor'' began drawing more respect. As
drama it may have been wanting, but his fellow filmmakers admired
Bernardo Bertolucci's achievement in fulfilling such a difficult
project with style and class. Hence ``The Last Emperor'' appears
the favorite to win as best picture and for Bertolucci's direction.
   Here is an estimate of the acting categories:
   Best actress: Again, Holly Hunter of ``Broadcast News'' was the
early favorite, but she pulled a vanishing act while Cher appeared
on a half-dozen magazine covers. For exposure alone (please, no
puns), Cher looks like the winner for ``Moonstruck.'' Her
performance was widely admired besides.
   Best actor: It looks like the year of Michael Douglas. No more
the nice guy, he was impressive as the Boesky-like inside trader in
``Wall Street.''
   Best supporting actress: Ann Sothern would be the sentimental
choice for ``The Whales of August.'' But the likely winner is
Olympia Dukakis of ``Moonstruck.''
   Best supporting actor: A spirited race, but here sentiment is
likely to prevail _ Sean Connery for ``The Untouchables.''

   particular cactus was uprooted illegally. They don't have brands on
them, you know. The crooks are aware of this, and that's why it's
big business. This time we got lucky.''
   Big business, yes, though not in comparison with the traffic in
drugs or even illegal birds smuggled through the American
Southwest. But these states are facing dwindling water supplies and
are encouraging developers, resort operators and homeowners to turn
to desert plants for their landscaping. As a result, the legal
trade in cactus in Arizona, just one state, has grown to about $2
million a year. The illegal trade, according to state experts, is
probably half again as much. The cactus in the nursery had a
sticker price, as it were, of $15,000.
   Moreover, the sleuths who pursue cactus rustlers seem every bit
as determined as yesterday's cattle-rustler posses and today's
narcotics detectives, and the crime just as pernicious.
   They view the illegal ripping of a fragile plant out of a
fragile desert as a desecration, a ruthless violation of a
cathedral of nature. All they have to do is look south across the
Mexican border to see the unholy bleakness of the very same desert
practically laid bare by cactus rustlers and smugglers.
   Such was their dedication that luck played only a minor role in
catching the thieves who stole the great cactus that wound up in
the Las Vegas nursery.
   That capture came about because of an observant nature-lover
from Oregon whose outrage set on the thief's trail wildlife agents
from three states and the federal government. Their hunt took eight
months. It led to the nation's first and only felony conviction to
date for the crime of cactus rustling.
   Of all the 5,000 varieties of cactuses, the one that comes to
mind with the very word is the saguaro, Cereus giganteus, the giant
of the desert, pronounced suh-WAH-row.
   If you see saguaros growing in the wild you are looking at
southern Arizona, their only natural home on this planet. If you
see them at sunset, the needles covering their giant torsos and
uplifted arms reflect an aura of gold; in moonlight, silver. They
seem to possess a mystical quality.
   The Papago Indians, who harvest cactus fruit to make wine and
jelly, call saguaros ``the old men.'' The residents of Quartzsite,
Ariz., had a special name for the one tracked to that Nevada
nursery: ``Old Granddad.''
   A saguaro grows only an inch or less a year in the arid desert.
That would make Old Granddad 200 years old. Saguaros don't even
develop their characteristic arms until they are at least 70.
   Old Granddad stood in utter remoteness 20 miles east of
Quartzsite, an old stagecoach stop on what is now I-10. But Old
Granddad, which stood there before the first stagecoach arrived,
wasn't visible from any paved road.
   Roy and Rosslee Crockett, from Baker, Ore., heard about the
majestic saguaro when they first wintered near Quartzsite back in
1977.
   ``It was not like any other saguaro we had ever seen,'' Mrs.
Crockett said. She and Roy of course took snapshots of each other
standing next to Old Granddad. Each winter thereafter the Crocketts
drove their camper to southwestern Arizona, and each year made a
trip out to visit Old Granddad and make snapshots.
   And indeed it was like no other saguaro they had seen or were
likely to see.
   It was a crested saguaro, the rarest of the rare. According to
Victor Gass, curator of the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix,
maybe one saguaro in 200,000 develops a crest, and Old Granddad had
the most developed crest Gass or any of his colleagues had ever
seen.
   A crest is a fan-shaped growth on the top of the plant's main
stem. It is actually a deformity, a botanical aberration called
``fasciation.'' Nobody knows what causes it. It occurs only in the
wild and can't be reproduced in a nursery. On this particular
saguaro the crest measured more than 6 feet across and 4 feet tall.
   On Roy and Rosslee Crockett's ninth winter in Quartzsite, Old
Granddad was gone.
   ``We didn't know what to do or what to think,'' Rosslee Crockett
said. ``The more I thought about it the madder I got. Finally I
called the sheriff.''
   The following day Mrs. Crockett's report reached Alex Leivas, an
agent of the Arizona Agricultural and Horticultural Commission
whose district encompasses Quartzsite and whose duties include that
of cactus cop, as they are known in the state.
   She led him to the hole in the ground where the old cactus had
stood. Leivas found some tire tracks and took some pictures. She
showed him her own pictures of Old Granddad.
   ``I had figured it was just another saguaro,'' Leivas said.
``When I saw her pictures, I thought, wow. I had never seen such a
crested saguaro.''

   Leivas returned to the site with survey maps and confirmed his
suspicion that it was on land controlled by the Bureau of Land
Management, federal land, and phoned Keeler, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife agent.
   Then he recalled a ``transit notice'' he had received earlier
from a border agent in California, information the two states
exchange when native plants are transported across state lines. To
uproot a protected plant legally requires a permit from the state
and a metal tag affixed to the plant.
   The notice said that a load of cactuses, duly tagged, had passed
through Vidal Junction, Calif., on a flatbed truck Feb. 3. It
mentioned no crested saguaro, but, as Leivas discovered later, the
saguaro had been hidden beneath other varieties of especially
prickly plants, concealed as if by barbed wire. The notice said the
load was bound for Las Vegas, the carrier listed as Rattlesnake
Ranch near Wenden, Ariz.
   Leivas decided to check it out. Meanwhile, he had Mrs.
Crockett's pictures made into a sort of wanted poster, like a
missing-child bulletin in a supermarket, and mailed a copy to every
border checkpoint in Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico.
   He also sent a poster to John Jones of the Nevada Division of
Forestry in Las Vegas, and told him about the load of cactuses.
Jones immediately recognized the picture of the crested saguaro as
one that recently arrived at Cactus King, a leading Nevada nursery.
   But a picture is not, as the cops say, a positive I.D., so
Keeler and Leivas arranged to drive the 300 miles to Las Vegas with
Mr. and Mrs. Crockett and have them take a look.
   ``There it is!'' Roy Crockett cried, even before they pulled
into the nursery.
   Said Linda Akers, the assistant U.S. attorney who prepared the
case for trial, ``It was the only plant lineup I've ever heard of.
I mean, `Mr. and Mrs. Crockett, do you recognize any plant among
that bunch?' You have to admit it's bizarre.''
   It turned out the deal had been made through a middleman, a
broker, and the the nursery owner was unaware that it was illegal.
The thief sold it for $1,300 to the broker, who resold it to the
nursery for $1,500. That would be about the markup for any saguaro
this size, but this crested beauty was special.
   ``After it was here a week I was offered $7,500,'' said the
nursery owner, Jeff Meckley. ``Obviously I wasn't going to let it
go for the first offer, but the truth is I didn't want to sell it
at all. That's why I marked it up to $15,000. It was so magnificent
I wanted to keep it myself.''
   Meckley, disappointed, bundled up Old Granddad with loving care
and proper equipment. He hauled it to where Keeler had arranged for
its keeping, the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix.
   It is no easy job to move a giant saguaro without damage,
internal or external. They are deceptively heavy, storing enough
water within to last as long as four years without a refill. This
one weighed two tons. Transporting one safely involves hydraulic
hoists and slings and padded cradles. The thief had used none.
   Now Keeler and Leivas had their cactus, but not their case.
   The cactus was tagged with a legitimate tag, No. 10108. It was
issued to Glen and Karen Clontz of the Rattlesnake Ranch on Jan.
10, 1986. It authorized them to dig cactuses along a 100-foot-wide
right-of-way for an oil pipeline across the Arizona desert.
   The only time permission is given to uproot any of Arizona's 212
species of protected plants from state or federal land _ which
constitutes 87 percent of Arizona soil _ is when they are in
certain danger of being destroyed by such a project.
   Keeler found Rattlesnake Ranch ``out in the middle of nowhere''
in a place known as Butler Valley. The ``ranch'' turned out to be a
trailer and a few other beat-up vehicles. No electricity. No
running water.
   The Clontzes admitted they had dug the crested cactus. They
maintained that they had saved it in the nick of time from the
pipeline bulldozers. Keeler noticed a dozen saguaros scattered
about, with no tags, and also an immature red-tailed hawk, a
protected bird, which he found starving to death in a cage. He took
the pitiful creature to a rehabilitation center in Phoenix.
   ``Who's to say precisely where a cactus was taken?'' Keeler
said. ``He claimed it came from the pipeline path. Without the
Crockett's photos we didn't have much of a case.''
   So Keeler took the photos out to the site and stood in the exact
spot where the Crocketts had stood and snapped his own pictures.
The backgrounds matched. Only Old Granddad was missing _ a mile
from the pipeline. That sewed it up.
   ``The evidence was so overwhelming,'' said U.S. attorney Akers,
``that we let the Clontzes plead guilty and saved the expense of a
trial.''
   Under Arizona law cactus rustling is a misdemeanor. Under
federal law it is a felony and this was the first time the
government had had the evidence to make it stick. In recognition,
the Crocketts received a $2,000 reward.
   On Feb. 23, 1987, a year and a day after Rosslee Crockett
reported the missing saguaro to the sheriff, Glen and Karen Clontz
were each fined $250 and he was sent off to the federal
penitentiary in Boron, Calif., where he served six months of a
two-year sentence. Both were put on five years supervised probation
and forbidden to deal in plants for that period.
   ``When I called the sheriff,'' said Mrs. Crockett, ``I thought
he would just scold somebody and make them put it back. Now I know
what it means to make a federal case out of something.''
   The baby hawk died.
   So, at last, did the cactus.
   Gass, of the Botanical Gardens, said the great plant had
suffered more knocking around than it could endure.``Something had
gotten inside it, some form of bacteria,'' he said. ``We have kept
the crest, to study it.''
   So they have. It rests on soft grass in the shade and is
magnificent in its size, a rotting relic of desert glory, destroyed.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A decade ago, writer Robert Campbell made the
switch from screenplays to mysteries. Nothing much happened for a
time. Then, in 1986, he won an Edgar, the mystery-writing
equivalent of an Oscar. Campbell's been writing up a storm ever
since.

<TEXT>
   Robert Campbell is having such a good time with
the renaissance of his writing career that there are rainy Sundays
when he sits at his home computer and writes instead of making
himself take the day off.
   Campbell studied to be a painter but instead became a Hollywood
screenwriter. He was nominated for an Academy Award for ``Man of
1,000 Faces,'' and wrote ``Machine Gun Kelly'' and ``Masque of the
Red Death.''
   ``My film career was not that illustrious,'' he says. ``I made a
lot of money is about what it amounted to.''
   Ten years ago, on a visit to Carmel, Calif., he says, ``I went
to the end of Ocean Avenue to look at the sunset and suddenly
realized I had literally been starved for visual beauty. I wasn't
in town three days when I knew I was moving. You can't write
screenplays from there. I wrote two after I got there. Neither
picture was ever made.''
   He bought a tiny house and started writing murder mysteries. He
wrote two he was proud of, ``The Spy Who Sat and Waited,'' set in
World War I, and ``Fat Tuesday,'' set in New Orleans. Nothing much
happened.
   Then his ``Junkyard Dog,'' published in 1986, won an Edgar,
given by the Mystery Writers of America, as best original paperback.
   ``It launched my mystery career,'' Campbell says. ``Everything
sort of exploded all at once. My name was suddenly known among the
mystery people _ almost overnight. Now it has spread out, I
understand, to the general population as well.''
   He exploded like a geyser. In 1987, he wrote five books.
   He now has three heroes going.
   His newest is Jake Hatch in ``Plugged Nickel,'' which Pocket
Books published in March. It introduces a detective for the
Burlington Northern Railroad, based in Omaha, Neb., who has a lady
friend in nearly every station.
   ``I always wanted to do a nostalgic detective who has a
connection with the railroads,'' Campbell says. ``He does things
for decent reasons. He stands for a time when America was innocent
and when railroads were the principal way of getting around.'' He
currently is writing Jake Hatch's second adventure, ``Red Cent.''
   He intends to make his other two series ``sort of dignified
novels of social injustice. Jimmy Flannery is a political precinct
captain in Chicago. He's an ombudsman for the little guy. Whistler,
a private detective, operates out of LA, which I call La-La Land.''
   Flannery came first, for publisher New American Library, in
``Junkyard Dog,'' then starred in ``The 600-Pound Gorilla,''
``Hip-Deep in Alligators'' and a new one, ``Thinning the Turkey
Herd.'' All have a murder and a subplot.
   ``The second plot has to do with Flannery, by a tricky device,
coming off triumphant over a political reality. I have a lot of fun
figuring those out,'' Campbell says.
   In the Whistler series, he says, ``I write books as tough as any
being written today.'' Mysterious Press published ``In La-La Land
We Trust'' then Campbell moved to Poseidon Press for ``Alice in
La-La Land.'' He is finishing ``Sweet La-La Land'' and plans ``The
Wizard of La-La Land.''
   ``I'm not going to drop the character or the locale but I'm not
going to have La-La in the title any more. My thought is, when they
go to paperback, to bring them out as a boxed set and call it the
La-La Land Quartet.''
   Though ``not a crusader,'' Campbell shows his fury at child
pornography in ``In La-La Land We Trust.'' He calls the book ``a
hard dose to take'' and adds, ``but that's the way it is. I'm not
over-expressing. I knew policemen in Los Angeles. Years ago I
talked to one who said, `I know of people who can deliver on your
doorstep a child, boy or girl, do with them as you will, no
questions asked, for $2,500.''' Campbell took care to write so as
not to titillate people attracted to child pornography.
   ``I don't believe in censorship, but I think part of the
development of human societies has been the ability to make hard
choices where your right to express yourself impacts on my right to
be kept safe from harm,'' he says.
   ``There ought to be a way, even with freedom of speech, where we
can stop child porn publications. The First Amendment protection
doesn't impress me.''
   He has written and sold ``Juice,'' not in a series, to Simon and
Schuster, for publication in 1990. ``Series can wear you out,'' he
says. But he started them deliberately, ``because a certain amount
of income is assured.
   ``But the most felicitous thing about making a living writing is
to make some contribution of excellence somewhere along the line or
to sound the alarm.''
   Campbell, now 60, was born in Newark, studied fine art at
Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, and joined the Army. His brother went
to acting school, then to Hollywood. ``He was home at Christmas one
time I got a leave,'' Campbell says. ``He was doing a picture,
`Battle Cry.' I said, `How much does somebody make for writing a
thing like this?' He said, `Probably $50,000.'''
   Campbell followed his brother to Hollywood. ``I said I'd give
myself two years. If I can't break into the business or I find out
I don't like it, I'll go to New York and get a job at an ad agency
as an artist.
   ``Things started happening. I sold a lot. Then the town started
getting to me. It's a bad town. I think cities can bring out the
best or worst in people. I spent my youth in large cities. It is
only since I moved to Carmel I discovered I was really a small-town
guy at heart.''
   In Hollywood, he developed a drinking problem, Campbell says.
While he didn't mess up any screenplays he wrote, he's sure that he
missed being given assignments. He quit drinking 15 years ago.
   Screenwriting was good preparation for writing mysteries,
Campbell says. ``You learn versatility. You choose a lot of
subjects and backgrounds and feel comfortable with them. It teaches
you to establish your characters and set the story rolling in a
limited space.''
   Now he writes more than one novel at once. ``I will write five
pages of whatever is the primary book _ the next one to the
publisher. I may play tennis. Later in the afternoon or evening, if
I feel so inclined, I will turn to the secondary book.
   ``It gives my mind time to relax, in a sense, instead of
pounding away at the same problems you pounded at earlier in the
day. You let your subconscious do some of the work for you.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ James Comer learned from personal experience
that scholastic success depends not just on good teachers but also
on good relations between families and schools. Now an expert on
child development, he's putting his theories to work in a program
to help low-income minority children.

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than 40 years, three boyhood
friends still come frequently to mind for Dr. James P. Comer, an
expert in the education of disadvantaged children.
   Comer and his friends were black low-income kids attending the
same integrated elementary school in East Chicago, Ind. Comer, now
53, went on to medical school and national prominence in the child
development field. But one of his friends died of alcoholism, a
second has been in and out of mental institutions, and the third
has spent much of his life in jail.
   Comer, the force behind a Yale University program to help
low-income minority children do well in school, says he and his
four siblings were successful because they had the firm support of
their parents and teachers. But for his three friends, it was a
different story.
   ``Something was wrong in the relationship between them and the
school, their families and the school. ... My friends didn't want
to see their parents in school,'' says Comer, a Yale professor of
child psychiatry and associate dean of the Yale Medical School.
   ``What was clear to me as a result of that experience and other
experiences was that school integration alone is not the issue. ...
That quality teaching, whatever that is, is not the issue. It is
relationships,'' Comer says.
   That insight was part of the springboard for the Yale school
intervention program, directed by Comer. He says it has shown
positive results in New Haven, Benton Harbor, Mich., and Prince
Georges County, Md., and is taking root in Lee County, Ark., and
Norfolk, Va.
   ``One thing Dr. Comer's work and research have clearly pointed
out is that regardless of socio-economic background and color of
skin, children can do extremely well in school,'' says Gerald
Tirozzi, Connecticut's commissioner of education.
   Parent-school relationships are a major focus of the school
intervention program. It seeks to overcome the hostility that some
low-income parents feel toward school, which they may view as part
of mainstream America from which they have been excluded, Comer
explains.
   Comer tells of a first-grader who once told his teacher, ``My
momma said I don't have to do anything you say.''
   Parents and school staff must ``respect each other and get the
transfer of authority from home to school that existed almost
automatically in a pre-1945 school,'' Comer, 53, says.
   Parents in the Yale program are encouraged to volunteer, and
when feasible, work for pay in schools as aides. They are asked to
attend and plan school social functions.
   Other elements include a parent-teacher-principal school
management committee, a mental health team, and curriculum and
staff development.
   The mental health team, made up of social workers and other
professionals who may be working already in a school system,
anticipates instead of reacts to problems, Comer says.
   For example, an orientation program developed by one team helps
children transferring to a new school. In another innovation, the
same teacher stays with a class through two school years, to
encourage close child-teacher relations that in turn foster
learning.
   The school management committee encourages consensus action,
while staff and curricula programs address the school's specific
needs.
   ``We have parents, teachers and administrators working together
to create a social environment in the school that promoted the
development of the children. ... Essentially, we figured out that
we could systematically teach low-income children in that
supportive environment,'' Comer says.
   The program has run the longest _ about 20 years _ in the Martin
Luther King Jr. Elementary School in New Haven. More than 90
percent of its 260 students are black, and many live with single
working mothers. The neighborhood is one of New Haven's poorest.
   Before the program started, contact between the school and
parents was limited. Performance by fourth-graders in reading and
math achievement tests trailed the national average by 19 months
and 18 months respectively.
   ``Now by fourth grade they are a year above grade level,'' Comer
reports.
   Attendance is up, teacher turnover is almost non-existent, and
academic rankings for math and language arts had risen by 1984 to
among the top five of 26 New Haven schools.
   King teachers Anne O'Connell and Allene Small report that their
interaction with parents is good. ``There's constant communications
with parents,'' O'Connell says.
   Cindy Bogan, a parent and school volunteer, says she didn't see
the same level of parental involvement when she was a kid.
   ``They really gear the kids in the right direction,'' she says.
   In a follow-up study several years later, former King students
were found to be doing better in middle schools than other children
from their neighborhood, Comer says.
   The program is being incorporated into other New Haven schools.
An outgrowth has been the testing of a social skills curriculum in
the city's middle schools, emphasizing problem-solving,
decision-making and self-control.
   Comer reports that academic achievement is also up in the Prince
Georges County, Md., and Benton Harbor, Mich., schools. The program
is in its first year in Norfolk, Va., and Lee County, Ark., and
can't be measured yet, he says.
   ``We're at the point now where we know something,'' says Comer.
``You have to buy it because it makes sense and it works.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The name ``Woodstock'' evokes musical memories,
and not just of the long-ago '60s. To a new generation of
musicians, the upstate New York hamlet is still among the best
places to make records, with all the equipment and none of the
exhaust fumes of Los Angeles or New York.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Record producer Bob Clearmountain is used
to the skeptical looks he gets when he invites musicians to this
upstate New York hamlet to make records.
   ``They get this picture in their minds of a gang of hippies
running around,'' says Clearmountain, producer or mixer for Bruce
Springsteen, the Pretenders and dozens of other artists.
   Woodstock may always be synonymous with the festival that bears
its name, the last great party of the flower children before the
'70s set in.
   But to a new generation of musicians, this town of boutiques and
endless back roads has a growing reputation as one of the best
places to make a record outside the music capitals of Los Angeles
and New York.
   Like Max Yasgur's farm, the Bearsville Studio is not actually in
Woodstock. It's about two miles west, atop a hill reached by a
winding, unmarked dirt road that in winter sometimes takes two or
three attempts to climb by car.
   Despite the location, Suzanne Vega found Bearsville to record
her breakthrough hit, ``Luka.'' Robbie Robertson returned to the
site of ``Big Pink'' to mix his comeback album. Artists as diverse
as Simple Minds, Cher, Allen Ginsberg and Loudness have laid down
tracks at Bearsville in the last year.
   The big draw? A country ambiance and equipment that makes
technicians like Clearmountain marvel.
   ``It's one of my favorite studios,'' Clearmountain says. ``It's
very versatile. The recording room is very large and it's very good
for recording drums and guitars. It has a lot of air and a lot of
space ... The other room is one of the best mixing rooms that I've
ever worked in.''
   The studio is part of the late Albert Grossman's mini-empire in
the village of Bearsville, a hundred miles north of Manhattan. The
one-time manager of Bob Dylan, the Band and Janis Joplin bought a
restaurant, homes and offices and built the studio before his death
two years ago.
   The Bearsville record label, whose best-known client was fellow
resident Todd Rundgren, has been inactive since Grossman's death.
But the studio, once used almost exclusively by Bearsville artists,
has seen more action.
   ``We just kind of intensified it,'' says Grossman's widow,
Sally, who now runs the company.
   Sally Grossman may talk eagerly of the Greenwich Village clubs
she grew up around in the '60s, but her studio has the air of a
corporate retreat.
   Fresh-smelling wood paneling and blackened windows blend the
modern and rustic. Framed pictures of the cover art of albums
recorded in Bearsville during the past year line the walls of
second-floor offices.
   Halfway down the hill is one of a handful of private homes
Grossman has converted into apartments for clients to use while
recording. A second house, separated by a Catskill mountain stream
and wooden bridge, has been converted into a rehearsal studio.
   ``It's in Woodstock, not in downtown Manhattan, and if you want
to get some air you just walk outside,'' Clearmountain says. ``You
don't walk outside and get hit by bus fumes.''
   A producer with deadlines also doesn't have to worry about
distractions that cause musicians' minds to wander. Outside of a
ping pong or pool table and a nearby vegetable stand, there's not a
whole lot to do in Woodstock.
   And groupies? They'd have to be pretty determined.
   ``A lot of the groups prefer working here because of the
privacy,'' says Mary Lou Arnold, a former backup singer to Rundgren
who's acting manager of the studio. ``We maintain very strict
security. I can count on one hand the number of times fans have
been able to find this place. And when they do, they quickly go
away.''
   Of course, the isolation can quickly grow old. Clearmountain
says artists on extended projects like to split their time between
Bearsville and the city. Musicians who need to rent equipment also
have to wait longer for it to arrive.
   Bearsville's studio is also the beneficiary of the current trend
toward spacious rooms _ the better for bands to set up and run
through songs live.
   ``The people who built it, I don't think they knew what they
were doing. But the way it was built works very well,''
Clearmountain says. ``Most studios are very claustrophobic, with
lots of wires, amplifiers and drums lying around that people can
trip over. That studio is so big, you can either set up everybody
tight in a corner or spread everybody out.''
   Bearsville's growing appeal is more than technical. When a hit
record is produced there, it sets in motion music's infamous herd
mentality.
   ``We get a lot of calls from people who are new who think if
they just come in here, they'll get a hit record,'' Arnold says.
   A long walk away from the studio, the town of Woodstock is a
jumble of small shops and restaurants. Even on a brisk winter's
day, a long-haired, middle-aged man or two stands idly in a small
park, watching traffic go by.
   Woodstock already had a long history as an artist's colony
before musicians discovered it in the '60s. When Dylan moved here
from New York City, it instantly became a magnet for hipsters and
aspiring hipsters.
   It was in Woodstock, in a house dubbed ``Big Pink,'' that the
Band recorded some of its best music, including the famed
``basement tapes'' with Dylan. At the time, Dylan was recovering
from a near-fatal motorcycle accident.
   Woodstock's singular event, the three-day concert that attracted
450,000 people and such artists as Joplin, the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Sly and the Family Stone, took place in 1969. Its actual
location was several miles away in Bethel.
   The area's musical history comes alive in cans of tapes that
fill shelves in a narrow storage room of Bearsville Studio.
Scrawled black magic markers identify the master tapes of work by
the Band, Rundgren and dozens of others.
   It's the foreign bands who are usually most interested in
Woodstock's history, Grossman says. She'll often give away books
that describe past events, and once gave an impromptu tour to a
Japanese heavy-metal band that wanted to see the sights.
   ``I think it means something,'' Clearmountain, who attended the
festival, says of the Woodstock mystique. ``Originally, people are
curious about it.''
   But it's the reputation of the studio, not the community, that
ultimately keeps musicians coming back, he says. ``It reinforces
how current we are.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Community Correctional Center in downtown
Detroit isn't anyone's idea of a country club. But to the
first-time offenders who live there, serving sentences for tax
evasion, mail fraud or embezzlement, it's a chance to repay social
debts without losing lucrative, white-collar jobs.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The residents of 125 Sproat live quiet lives,
faithfully going to work each day, spending their evenings playing
cards or watching television, and doing community service once a
week.
   Not the usual routine of your average federal inmate. But these
inmates aren't in your average federal prison.
   They are residents of the Community Correctional Center, one of
two programs in the country _ the other is in Washington, D.C. _
that allows first-time offenders to keep their jobs while serving
out sentences of up to one year.
   The 50-bed prison houses six women and 37 men. They live in
dormitory-style rooms in the two floors above a Salvation Army.
   Most have been convicted of white-collar crimes such as tax
evasion, mail fraud and bank embezzlement. A few have dabbled in
drug-dealing.
   Once through the program, established in 1985, none of the 300
inmates has been a repeat criminal offender.
   A 36-year-old Detroit man who asked to remain unidentified is in
the center for securities fraud. He would have gone to a closed
prison if the program did not exist.
   A parole hearing at the Federal Correctional Institute in Milan
gave him a taste of what he might have been forced to endure.
   ``You walk in and see the guards in the towers with the guns,
and see the bars on the doors ... I'm happy ... to be in this
place,'' he said.
   The knowledge that a conventional prison could be the next step
is the idea the program tries to get across.
   ``There are a lot of people who've made mistakes in their lives,
but whose lives aren't buried because of it,'' said Albert Uhl,
U.S. Bureau of Prisons community corrections administrator in
Detroit.
   ``The court didn't want to put them in confinement but wanted
some constrictions so the seriousness of the situation would sink
in,'' he said. ``In most cases, they are middle-class people who
made one bad judgment.''
   Courts carefully screen for inmates they think will benefit from
the program, Uhl said. Anyone who has already served time in
prison, or has a history of assault or a drug problem, is
ineligible, he said.
   The center is not the ``country club'' some associate with
high-profile white-collar criminals.
   Inmates occupy two- and-three bedroom units, furnished with a
few basics, including a bed, a dresser, and a night stand. It is
situated in a depressed area of downtown Detroit, surrounded by
abandoned buildings and litter-strewn lots.
   ``There probably isn't anyone here who hasn't been approached by
a drug dealer, bum or prostitute,'' one inmate said.
   Still, absent from the typical prison setting are barred cells,
armed guards and violent offenders. These inmates are accountants,
securities dealers and pharmacists. Many find the company
first-rate.
   ``I'm having a ball here,'' said Leonard, a 48-year-old
accountant, in the center for tax fraud. ``I shoot pool, there's a
great bunch of guys here. It's like an Army barracks.''
   Though not ecstatic to be there _ he said he would have gotten
probation if the program did not exist _ he is philosophical about
it, and he stays upbeat.
   ``My relations with my family are better,'' he said. ``We don't
take each other for granted anymore.''
   Helping maintain family ties is another aim of the program,
where visits are allowed three times a week.
   One inmate initially decided against having his children, a
3-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son, see him there. He later
changed his mind, thinking it might be beneficial.
   ``I explained the situation to my son,'' he said. ``I wanted him
to see if you do something wrong, you're going to pay for it.''
   Program administrator Rosiland Humes said nine inmates have
failed to comply with the rigid rules and were transferred to
lockup facilities. Two tried to escape, were captured, and taken to
other prisons, she said.
   ``There is a commitment on the part of the federal bureau of
prisons to move in this direction,'' Uhl said, noting the federal
prison population is expected to triple to 150,000 by the year 2002.
   Oakland County Prosecutor L. Brooks Patterson, known for his
tough law-and-order stance, agrees the program can be beneficial.
   ``If a tax evader is persistently and gainfully employed and can
pay back Uncle Sam, I think we're better off for it,'' Brooks said.
   Patterson agrees white-collar criminals should be treated
differently from violent offenders.
   ``I don't think anyone in their right mind can't distinguish an
embezzler from a rapist,'' Patterson said. ``A white-collar
offender is not going to rape and pillage the community.''
   The relaxed atmosphere might give the impression inmates have
considerable freedom. They move about the center freely, playing
pool, watching television, using weight-training equipment, and
joking with supervisors.
   But the sense of confinement is very real.
   Each inmate has a curfew, and is allowed to leave only for work.
Inmates are tested regularly for substance and alcohol abuse, the
facility is searched monthly, and random pat searches are part of
the daily routine.
   ``It's dehumanizing to have someone telling you to do this and
do that,'' one inmate said.
   A constant fear for some inmates is the thought of being
transferred to a closed facility.
   ``It's a bad feeling to see a person handcuffed and taken out,''
said one inmate, who saw several residents removed by a federal
marshal after they failed drug tests.
   Still, many take their stay in stride, and maintain a sense of
humor.
   Listed on the current activities schedule are roller skating and
quilting.
   ``I think I'm a little bit past the roller-skating age,'' said
one inmate, a burly, 42-year-old Detroit man in the center for
selling cocaine.
   ``But, hey, I won a candle playing bingo,'' he said.
   Several inmates think the program would be a good franchise
investment, even if their criminal records would prevent them from
getting such a contract. They point to the requirement that inmates
pay part of their daily $37.50 subsistence, based on a sliding
scale.
   However, there's no return on this facility, which is managed by
Project Rehab, a non-profit organization based in Grand Rapids that
also runs drug abuse centers and pre-release programs.
   Establishing the center was the project of U.S. District Judge
John Feikens, Uhl said. He said Feikens pushed the idea after the
federal bureau of prisons decided the federal court volume didn't
warrant building a detention center in Detroit.

   Gregory Harrison hadn't intended to play in
his remake of the 1948 screen classic ``Red River'' until several
actors turned down the role of the gunfighter.
   ``Two weeks before we started shooting, we still hadn't cast the
role of Cherry Valance,'' says Harrison. ``After several actors
turned it down I said, `I guess that means I should do the part.'
That's how I ended up in it. Everybody else had been cast for a
long time.''
   James Arness stars as Tom Dunson, a tough, embittered ranch
owner who organizes a cattle drive at the end of the Civil War to
save his financially troubled empire. Bruce Boxleitner is Matthew
Garth, his adopted son just back from the war, who clashes
repeatedly with Dunson. The two-hour movie will be telecast Sunday
on CBS.
   The story, in essence, is ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' on a trail
drive, as Matthew is finally driven to rebellion against his
tyrannical adoptive father.
   Harrison, who is co-executive producer with his partner in
Catalina Productions, Franklin R. Levy, says it was ``scary''
taking on the remake of the beloved Western.
   John Wayne starred in the original as Dunson. Montgomery Clift
was Matt. The movie, directed by Howard Hawks, also starred Walter
Brennan, Joanne Dru and John Ireland. Ray Walston plays the Brennan
role, Laura Johnson plays Dru's role and Harrison takes over from
Ireland.
   The closest Harrison's ever come to playing in a Western was the
role as pioneer Levi Zendt in the miniseries ``Centennial.''
   ``I was able to have a lot of freedom with the role of the
gunfighter because I wasn't carrying the movie,'' he says. ``I
could play the bad guy and have fun. I think my work is better
because I did feel free to take chances. I loved putting on the
chaps and the gun belt. I learned to rope.''
   Although it's a memorable movie, Harrison points out that it was
made 40 years ago. ``Most people today haven't seen it except on
the late show.'' he says. ``We've added some new characters and
story lines. My partner and I were also very interested in doing a
Western and there aren't very many opportunities for that.''
   There remain many links between old and new. The remake was
filmed in the same area between Tucson, Ariz., and the Mexican
border. Four members of Hawks' crew worked on the remake, as did
stunt man Bud Stout, who had a small role in the original.
   Arness was Wayne's protege, and it was Wayne who helped him get
the role as Matt Dillon on ``Gunsmoke.'' Boxleitner and Arness had
played together for a number of years in ``How The West Was Won.''
The branding iron used by Wayne was found and used in the new film.
   At the first reading of the script Arness read Boxleitner's
lines by mistake. After 20 years as Matt Dillon on ``Gunsmoke,'' he
read the lines for Matt by force of habit.
   Stan Shaw stars in a new role as a black broncobuster and
Zachary Ansley, a newcomer from Vancouver, Canada, plays the new
role of a teen-ager named Cal.
   ``I think we have a stronger story,'' says Harrison. ``We don't
have the limitations they had when they made the first one. I like
the idea of the black cowboy. It reflects more of today's thinking.
The only question is that you had such memorable performances (in
the original) that nostalgia buffs may not be able to accept (the
remake).''
   Harrison, who recently starred with John Larroquette in the CBS
comedy ``Hot Paint,'' spent 30 days at the Betty Ford Center to
break his dependency on drugs and alcohol. ``It's a very strong
program that teaches you to stay away from drugs and alcohol for
life,'' he says. ``It works for a lot of people. It works for me.''
   He's also producing a stage musical called ``Blame It on the
Movies,'' which features nearly a hundred movie tunes, and a
theatrical comedy called ``My Stepmother Is an Alien.'' Dan Aykroyd
and Kim Basinger star in the sci-fi comedy with Richard Benjamin
directing.
   Away from work, Harrison, whose father was the glass-bottom boat
operator on Catalina Island, is pursuing his goal of surfing around
the world.
   So far, he has surfed at Bali, Fiji, France, England, Denmark,
Israel, Greece, Morocco, South Africa, Australia and in the
Caribbean, as well as Hawaii and elsewhere in the United States.
   Harrison's last series was ``Trapper John, M.D.,'' in which he
played Gonzo for eight years.
   ``I'm ready to get back into a half-hour comedy show,'' he says.
``One that I'm producing and have control over. An hour show takes
too much of your time. I enjoy being around my wife and child too
much to do another hour show.''

   Michael Rupert does double duty delivering
``Mail.''
   The affable, boyish-looking actor not only stars in but wrote
the music for the new Broadway musical now playing at the Music Box
Theater.
   The show concerns a distraught man named Alex who returns home
after four months of solitude and discovers a mountain of mail just
waiting to be opened. When he does, personal letters, bills and
even junk mail come to life in song and dance.
   For Rupert, the decision to star in a musical he helped write
was a difficult one to make. He needed persuading.
   ``It's been exactly what I was scared it was going to be _
exhausting,'' he says now. ``I just don't have any time to myself
at all. But I love it. I'm a bit of a workaholic.''
   ``Mail'' began life in the summer of 1984 when Rupert and his
partner, Jerry Colker, already were working on ``3 Guys Naked From
the Waist Down,'' a musical about the world of stand-up comics.
   At the time, ``3 Guys'' was between an out-of-town tryout in
North Carolina and its off-Broadway premiere. The duo had some
moments to spare and kicked around an idea that Colker had about a
man who drops out of life for four months and then comes back to
face a stack of mail.
   Colker envisioned the story as a play. But what stuck in
Rupert's head was the part of the story about the letter writers
springing to life on stage.
   ``Alex, the main character, would interact with these people,''
he recalls. ``Maybe one letter was written four months ago and he
was here today. So you have these two different times and places,
and yet they were interacting. I thought, `How bizarre and
interesting this would be as a musical.'''
   It wasn't until more than a year later that Rupert and Colker
picked up the pieces of ``Mail.'' They worked furiously for three
months, rewriting the show for a reading in Los Angeles.
   Then they wrote by long-distance. Colker was in Los Angeles and
Rupert was starring on Broadway with Debbie Allen in a revival of
``Sweet Charity.''
   ``It is a little strange to switch gears from writing to
performing to writing,'' he recalls, ``but it was fun getting back
into `Mail' for me. I was ready for some creative writing.''
   After ``Sweet Charity'' closed in March 1987, Rupert and Colker
began reworking ``Mail,'' refining it on its long road to Broadway
that took the show to the Pasadena Playhouse in California and then
to the Kennedy Center in Washington.
   Writing musical comedy is a logical extension for Rupert, who at
36 is a veteran stage performer.
   ``Since I was a kid, I've been doing musical theater,'' he says,
summing up in one sentence a show business career that begin in
earnest at age 12. By his teens, Rupert, born in Colorado but
transplanted to California, was guest-starring on television shows
such as ``Gunsmoke'' and ``My Three Sons.''
   Broadway beckoned in 1968 when he starred with Robert Goulet in
the musical ``The Happy Time.'' He later appeared in New York in
such shows as ``Pippin'' and ``March of the Falsettos.''
   ``When I wrote `3 Guys' I had this idea that I wasn't a
writer,'' Rupert says now. ``I had only written music as a hobby. I
thought, `Is anybody going to take this seriously?'''
   The critics did. Rupert and Colker were hailed as a promising
songwriting team. They hope to cement that reputation with
``Mail.'' The show, however, wasn't written with the idea that
Rupert would star in it.
   But the producers, director Andrew Cadiff and Colker all wanted
their composer to do it. He resisted.
   ``I didn't want to neglect the acting for the composing or vice
versa,'' Rupert says. ``We had had auditions and everything. Right
up until a month before rehearsal, I kept saying no.''
   Finally, they were able to convince him that he was the only
performer right for the role. What won Rupert over was the fact
that he would be supported by an experienced musical department.
   Heading the team _ with the title of musical supervisor _ was
Paul Gemignani, one of Broadway's most experienced musicians. In
recent years he has conducted every show by Stephen Sondheim.
   Rupert describes Gemignani's job as ``general custodian,''
making sure the music works. He oversees everything musical,
working with conductor Tom Fay, orchestrator Michael Gibson and
sound designer Tom Morse.
   ``With them, I feel confident enough to just get on the stage
and do my work,'' Rupert says. ``The biggest problem is that I am
on stage the entire show and even when people are singing, I will
be so distracted by what I hear in the monitor, I'll be going, `Did
I write that?'
   ``It's difficult to stay focused. I guess I just have to do the
best I can and play the character and not worry about the score.''

<HEAD>Islamic Militants Play Key Role in West Bank and Gaza Strip</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIT AL MAA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Islamic militants who
reject any negotiated settlement with Israel have played a key role
in the rebellion against military rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Mosques have often become fortresses for fighting Israeli
soldiers, and Moslem preachers use prayers during Friday Sabbath
services to rally support for the ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for
uprising.
   Underground leaflets and graffiti on walls are signed by the
Jihad Islami, the Islamic Resistance and ``Hamas,'' Arabic for
``zeal'' and the name used by the Moslem Brotherhood. ``Allahu
Akbar'' (God is Great) has become a common battle cry.
   The uncompromising rhetoric of such groups is cited by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir as evidence that the unrest is not a
political protest but a war aimed at the destruction of Israel.
   ``We demand that the Jews be put under our rule,'' said Sheik
Jamil Salim, a 29-year-old Imam, or Moslem prayer leader, in this
hillside refugee camp near the West Bank town of Nablus.
   ``We are taught by the Koran (Moslem holy book) that Jews have
no good intentions to establish peace. They are breakers of
agreements and covenants.''
   Salim, who offers an interviewer a meat-and-milk dish called
Shush Barak, lives with 18 members of his extended family in a
four-room, stone house on a street so narrow a donkey cart cannot
pass.
   He is critical of Arab states and the Palestine Liberation
Organization on grounds that they are not doing more for the cause.
He contends the revolt is linked to the growth of Islam, especially
in the universities.
   ``For 20 years, there was no such uprising,'' he said. ``The
fact there is such an uprising now is because of religious groups.''
   Sitting cross-legged on floor cushions in his diwan, or meeting
room, Salim said one reason for the growth of Islam was the failure
of other ideologies.
   ``Socialism, nationalism and materialism, all the -isms,
failed,'' he said.
   Salim makes it clear he identifies with the Moslem Brotherhood,
founded in Egypt by school teacher Hassan Al Banna in 1929. He does
not oppose the diplomatic efforts of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat but
stresses an Arab state on the West Bank will not be enough.
   ``We are not against getting part of our rights. But we will
seek all of our rights. We refuse negotiations and reject an
international conference,'' said Salim.
   Outside, the walls bear dozens of slogans. One signed by the
Islamic Resistance, which is believed to be connected to the Moslem
Brothers, declares: ``Islam is the solution and the alternative.''
   Speaking in a mosque in the West Bank village of Mazraat
Sharqiyeh, Sheik Bassam Jarrar told several hundred young activists
that Israel tried to justify its actions in the West Bank to
Europeans and Americans by arguing that it was fighting
fundamentalists.
   ``Some people are trying to say that fundamentalists are behind
the uprising. They want to frighten the West,'' said Jarrar, a
Moslem preacher.
   Not all Arabs or Palestinians hold to the views of Salim and
Jarrar. Nor do the underground Moslem Brotherhood and other Islamic
fundamentalist groups, which along with the PLO are outlawed by
Israel, have a central spokesman or organ to expound them.
   The distrust of Israelis expressed by Salim is reflected to a
greater or lesser degree inby hardline prayer leaders in sermons
and in conversations with other Moslem fundamentalists.
   The opposition to a negotiated settlement expressed by Salim and
Jarrar is widely echoed, however. Moslem Brothers support the
creation of an Islamic state that would ultimately encompass all
states in the region, including Israel.
   In the Gaza Strip, where poverty is pervasive and a majority of
the 650,000 residents are refugees, outward signs of Islamic
influence such as traditional long dresses and veils for women are
more prevalent than in the relatively prosperous West Bank.
   The Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the Jebaliya refugee camp near
Gaza City.
   Ahmed Hashem Ali Saftawi, 53, who owns a pharmacy in Jebaliya,
said the stage for rebellion was set by a group founded in 1986 by
his 24-year-old son, Imad, and a dozen fellow students at the
Islamic University in Gaza City.
   The group took the name Jihad Islami, or Islamic Holy War, after
the shadowy pro-Iranian faction in Lebanon that carried out suicide
carbomb attacks on U.S. Marines and Israeli soldiers under the same
name, Saftawi said.

<HEAD>BEIT AL MAA: Saftawi said.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Growing to more than 50 active members, Jihad Islami in Gaza
drew inspiration from preachers with close ties with Iran, but
Saftwai insisted there was no outside direction or funding.
   The Iran orientation contrasts with the Moslem Brothers, who
support Iraq in the Gulf War and, as Sunni Moslems, oppose the
religious dogmas of Ayatollah Khomeini's Shiite Moslem regime.
   Saftawi, who joined the Moslem Brotherhood as a student in Cairo
in the 1950s and later was jailed in Israel for PLO activism, spoke
with pride about the group.
   The youths, jailed after carrying out knifings that wounded four
Israeli civilians, became local heros when six broke out of the
central Gaza prison on May 18, 1987.
   For five months they stayed underground, until October, when
four were killed in a shootout with Israeli forces. His son and
another man escaped abroad, a feat previously considered impossible.
   ``By their actions and their success, they gave confidence to
the Palestinian people to depend on themselves and be
self-sufficient,'' said Saftawi.
   This can-do attitude contrasts with ``the spirit and mood'' of
the older generation that had relied on outside help for
deliverance, Saftawi said.
   ``We were deceived into believing help would come from outside
and waited for the Arabs or Islamic states or the United Nations to
do something.''
   Two days after the interview in his home in Gaza City, Saftawi
was placed under administrative detention by Israeli military
authorities, who can keep him for six months without trial.
   The PLO, in response to fundamentalist revival, has tried to
channel some of the religious zeal into its own movement and has
formed an alliance with the student groups like Jihad Islami in
Gaza.
   Zohair Saadat Al Didi, 39, a Moslem preacher who served seven
years in jail for belonging to a guerrilla cell of Arafat's Fatah
movement, argues that a political settlement would stop the growth
of radical, fundamentalist groups.
   ``If the situation improves, then there would be no room for
such groups to continue. These groups will become weak and
ineffective,'' said Al Didi, a freelance journalist in Nablus,
known to his friends as Abu Islam.
   ``This occupation is good for the Moslem Brothers and other
radical movements.''
   Al Didi said even though his Fatah cell attacked and wounded an
Israeli soldier he does not believe in violence against civilians.
   ``I believe there should be coexistence between us and the
Israelis,'' he said. ``There is a possibility of reaching an
understanding and sharing the land: two states, a confederation,
cantons, it is not important how.''
   The relative strengths of the PLO and Islamic groups is
difficult to assess.
   Clinton Bailey, an Islamic expert at Tel Aviv University who is
carrying out a study, said fundamentalists claimed the allegiance
of at least 30 percent of the 850,000 residents of the West Bank
while in Gaza it was nearly 80 percent of 650,000.
   ``There is a certain gray area because not all people are one or
the other. Many who identify with the PLO also became religious,''
said Bailey.
   Religious zeal, he added, was one of the factors that brought
about the uprising.
   ``It gave people more daring and more of a willingness to
sacrifice. It is identified with a certain honesty, not tainted
like the PLO by materialism and corruption.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Milagro Beanfield War''; ``Off Limits''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War''
   
   Robert Redford's second film as a director has been a long time
coming. Eight years have passed between his intensely moving
``Ordinary People'' and the new release, ``The Milagro Beanfield
War.''
   Once again Redford exhibits his basic humanism, this time on a
social rather than personal level. And again he displays his
uncommon talent for working with actors; the large cast delivers a
number of memorable performances.
   Why then is ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' less than satisfying?
Magazine articles about its making have outlined the problems:
multiple script changes, wholesale reshooting. The tinkering
appears to have eroded the film's basic core. It is now a series of
audience-pleasing turns, with little sense of unity.
   The ``War'' harks back to Frank Capra: the good little people
against the big, bad land barons. A New Mexico hamlet is being
squeezed to death by a resort developer (Richard Bradford) with the
help of the state governor and his venal staff. The officials even
send a hatchet man, Christopher Walken, to terrorize the natives
when they grow restive under the rape of their land.
   The reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner, Chick
Vennara, who inadvertently diverts the land baron's water into his
beanfield. He becomes defiant, and others strive to make it a
crusade, especially the garage owner, Sonia Braga. She enlists a
disilussioned hippie, John Heard, to print fliers to further the
campaign.
   The land baron's goons, led by Walken, try to quell the revolt,
but the people will not give in. The sheriff, Ruben Blades, who
seems like a decent man when he isn't doing the land baron's
bidding, tries to forestall the imminent violence. The ending, as
you can guess, is pure Capra.
   Providing grace notes throughout the film are two engaging
figures: the venerable Amarante (Carlos Riquelme) who wanders
distractedly, accompanied by his adorable pig; the ghostly Angel
(Robert Carricart), who cavorts at dawn and dusk, playing his
concertina. They are marvelous codgers, depicting the vigorous
history of the fading town.
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' might have proved more effective
if the townspeople hadn't been so downright lovable and their
opponents so thoroughly detestable, and if the script by David Ward
and John Nichols (based on Nichols' book) had adhered to a central
story line instead of wandering over the New Mexico landscape; a
mountaintop gunfight in the middle of the movie seems a late
addition.
   Redford and Moctesuma Esparza produced the Universal Pictures
release. The R rating, apparently for language, seems overly
severe. Running time: 117 minutes.

   ``Off Limits''
   
   Buck McGriff and Albaby Perkins are tough cookies. How do we
know? Because they say spout obscenities at least once in every
sentence. That kind of crude characterization is the hallmark of
``Off Limits,'' a misfired Vietnam War movie that is long on macho
and short on credibility.
   ``Off Limits'' deals with the bleak underside of 1968 Saigon.
McGriff (Willem Dafoe) and Perkins (Gregory Hines) are military
police investigating a series of prostitute murders. Their search
leads them to believe that a high American officer with a taste for
kinky sex may have been the killer. The brass is alarmed, and the
two cops are thwarted in their investigation.
   Most of the action takes place in Saigon (Bangkok provided the
locations), and it never looked seedier. The same for the
underworld denizens _ whores, pimps, cutthroats, as well U.S.
soldiers on their worst behavior. The only civilized person is a
young convent novice (Amanda Pays) who counsels prostitutes and
hence can help provide clues to the killer's identity. She and
McGriff form a friendship that almost becomes something more.
   The two detectives' quest proves more dangerous as they move
closer to uncovering the culprit. Their work seems over when they
receive orders to ship out. But of course they couldn't leave a
mystery unsolved.
   Buck McGriff (sounds like a name for a 1950s movie star) and
Albaby Perkins are what you see. Except for Perkins' passion for
college basketball, we know nothing about them: their homes,
families, backgrounds. Not that we need a dossier on film
detectives but it would help to understand why they are so dogged
in their pursuit.
   The fault lies in the shallow, convoluted script of Christopher
Crowe and Jack Thibeau. As director, Crowe manages a fair degree of
suspenseful action. But he seems to be allowing the actors to ad
lib their dialogue, and the outpouring of obscenities becomes
almost ludicrous.
   Dafoe and Hines blend well as the buddy cops, but neither
character is well defined. Too often Dafoe dominates the
partnership, leaving Hines with little to do. Fred Ward registers
strongly as their helpful superior. Scott Glenn makes a brief
appearance as a crazed colonel whose sudden exit is surreal and
inexplicable.
   ``Off Limits'' is a 20th Century Fox release produced by Alan
Barnette. The rating is R, language, nudity, violence, sexual
content. Running time: 102 minutes.

   One of the biggest hits of last summer was Buena
Vista's ``Stakeout,'' a cop buddy movie starring Richard Dreyfuss
and Emilio Estevez.
   Earning $65 million, it had the longest hold in the No. 1
box-office spot and was one of the Top 10 movies of 1987.
   The comedy-thriller directed by John Badham is available this
month for home screens from Touchstone Home Video. It's one of two
recent hit movies in which a policeman assigned to watch a woman
falls in love with her. The other was ``Someone to Watch Over Me,''
starring Tom Berenger, available from RCA-Columbia Pictures Home
Video.
   Elsewhere, HBO Video plans a new music series called ``Super
Sessions.'' Available in May, the series will feature concerts and
performances by such musical talents as B.B. King, Roy Orbison,
Chaka Khan, Phil Collins, Freda Payne, Martha Reeves, Billy Ocean,
Eric Clapton and Etta James.
   ``Roy Orbison & Friends: A Black and White Night'' ($19.99,
VHS@Beta) will be one of the first videos released in the series.
Joining Orbison on stage are Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, Bonnie
Raitt, T-Bone Burnett, Tom Waits, Jennifer Warnes and Bruce
Springsteen.
   The concert, featuring such Orbison hits as ``Only the Lonely''
and ``Crying,'' was filmed at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles in
September 1987 and was made in black and white.
   Axon Video has released the Italian comedy, ``Spaghetti House''
($69.95, VHS@Beta), starring Nino Manfredi (``Bread and
Chocolate''). In English, the movie romps through the true story
about a group of Italian waiters who are held hostage in a London
restaurant.
   Also new from Axon is ``Vogues of 1938'' ($69.95, VHS@Beta). The
1937 movie, filmed in Technicolor, stars Warner Baxter in a story
about rival fashion houses. It features the Academy Award nominated
song, ``That Old Feeling,'' and a rare filmed performance from the
original Cotton Club Revue.
   Videos reviewed this week are ``Stakeout'' and ``Someone to
Watch Over Me.''

   ``Stakeout'' (Touchstone Home Video, $89.95, VHS@Beta, Rated R)
   
   John Badham's action-comedy opens on a richly funny note:
Richard Dreyfuss, a police officer, chases a bad guy and finds
himself squirming about in a vat filled with dead fish in a factory.
   Is this a cop or a guy auditioning for an Abbott and Costello
flick? Yeah, he's a cop all right, but teamed with ex-Brat Packer
Emilio Estevez, the nutty covortings often remind one of a comedy
duo.
   As the detective buddies, Chris and Bill, they are given the
overnight stakeout of Maria (Madeleine Stowe), the girlfriend of an
escaped murderer (Aidan Quinn). They ogle the beauty through a
telescope, and things become dicey when Chris (Dreyfuss) and Maria
meet and fall in love.
   ``I have to face up to my heterosexuality, but don't worry,
you'll be well provided for,'' he tells his partner.
   The chases, the violent teases (there's a cliffhanger or two in
a sawmill and a boat escape) and the nuttiness of Dreyfuss and
Estevez hold up well on the small screen. Badham maintains a
comfortable and easy balance between the banter and thrills. And
the chemistry between Dreyfuss and Estevez makes them believable
and lovable cop buddies and provides a good hoot on a rainy
afternoon or lazy night.

   ``Someone to Watch Over Me'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video,
$89.95, VHS@Beta, Rated R)
   
   ``Someone to Watch Over Me'' was one of two movies last year in
which the plot hinged on a cop falling in love with a woman he was
assigned to watch. ``Stakeout,'' a box-office smash, exploited the
comic, screwball potential of that device; in ``Someone,'' the
romance leads to near-tragic complications.
   Tom Berenger plays a New York City police officer, newly
promoted to detective, who lives happily in Queens with his warm,
no-nonsense wife (Lorraine Bracco) and son. The trouble starts when
he is assigned on the all-night shift to guard Mimi Rogers, a
Manhattan heiress who has witnessed a savage murder and is waiting
to identify the killer in a lineup.
   Long nights alone together in Miss Rogers' mammoth and elegant
East Side apartment lead to an affair, which jeopardizes Berenger's
marriage and career, as well as the lives of all the major
characters.
   What lends distinction to this essentially simple melodrama are
some fine performances _ especially by Berenger and Miss Bracco _
and the stylish direction of Ridley (``Alien'') Scott.
   Berenger, with his sensitive portrayal of a likable character
betrayed by his own weakness, demonstrates again his enormous
range. Hard to believe this is the same actor who played the
earnest but shallow TV star in ``The Big Chill'' and the evil
sergeant in ``Platoon.''
   Andreas Katsulas deserves mention, too, for his chilling
portrayal of a particularly sadistic villain.

   ``Lefty'' (Columbia) _ Art Garfunkel
   
   When Art Garfunkel released his first solo album in 1973,
ultra-hip Rolling Stone magazine interviewed him and asked him just
who he thought would purchase an album of sweet love songs (like
Jimmy Webb's ``All I Know'') in the waning days of acid rock.
``English lit. majors,'' he suggested.
   It is with the same wit and grace that Garfunkel offers
``Lefty,'' his seventh solo album, a lovely, unrelentingly romantic
record typified by such selections as the evocative ``I Have a
Love,'' a Bernstein-Sondheim selection from ``West Side Story.''
   Garfunkel makes even more use of his unique vocal style on this
album than he has on previous records, from the finger-snapping
``So Much in Love,'' a remake of the Tymes' 1963 hit, to a
interesting, Third World-sounding arrangement of Percy Sledge's
``When a Man Loves a Woman.''
   Background singers Pam Rose and Mary Ann Kennedy, members of the
Nashville group Calamity Jane, are the writers of the beautiful
``Love Is the Only Chain,'' which should be a hit on its own. Leah
Kunkel also sings backup, as does Stephen Bishop, who contributes
three songs. Kenny Rankin is heard on ``I Wonder Why.''
   ``Lefty'' is a soothing album, but by no means homogenized. With
each distinctive cut, Garfunkel proves his subtle range and
establishes once again that his taste in music is superb. Pop music
rarely shows more class.

   Beethoven, Symphony No. 9 (EMI) _ The London Classical Players,
the Schutz Choir of London, Roger Norrington conducting.
   Beethoven Cello Sonatas (Nonesuch) _ Anner Bylsma, cello;
Malcolm Bilson, fortepiano.
   Beethoven or Bust (Telarc) _ Don Dorsey, synthesizers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   There is a shock in seeing a monument, however familiar, cleaned
of accumulated grit and grime. It's recognizably the same, yet a
constant surprise in its new colors and highlights.
   Roger Norrington has achieved something quite as spectacular
with his recording of Beethoven's choral symphony. Stripped of the
extra parts added as orchestras grew, and shorn of interpretive
conventions of the late 19th and 20th centuries, the symphony
sounds fresh and new.
   Norrington returned not just to the original instrumentation,
but to Beethoven's tempo markings.
   Some of those tempos at first seem agonizingly slow, especially
in the concluding choral movement, but the logic becomes clear. The
chorus is not whipped into a shrieking frenzy as often happens in
the ``Ode to Joy.''
   This Ninth is an outstanding achievement.
   Beethoven is also brilliantly served by another exercise in
original instrumentation, the first and second cello sonatas
recorded by cellist Anner Bylsma and fortepianist Malcolm Bilson.
   By now, the question about any such performance is not whether
the instrumentation is authentic _ are the strings from a breed of
cat which Beethoven would have recognized? _ but whether the music
is compelling.
   On that score, Bylsma and Bilson are outstanding. Their
instruments may speak more quietly than their modern counterparts,
but with no less conviction or fire.
   Turning to completely unoriginal instruments...
   ``Beethoven or Bust'' sounds promising for, oh, about the first
10 seconds of the first cut, ``Rage Over a Lost Penny.'' Then comes
the first tinkle of a synthesized cymbal, followed shortly by an
elephantine boom-chuck boom-chuck boom-chuck, apparently added so
that the musically ignorant will know when to tap their feet.
   This is the sort of sensibility which holds that the Parthenon
by moonlight may be OK, but to really enjoy it you need a seltzer
bottle and a whoopee cushion.
   Don Dorsey, who had a chart-topper with ``Bachbusters'' in 1986,
is a skillful technician but, on this try, a musician of abysmal
taste. Skip it.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Ann Sothern Never Envisioned Oscar Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Look at that air!'' Ann Sothern exclaimed
as she gazed at the smog-laden sky outside the window of her
westside hotel room. ``Now you can see why I no longer live here.''
   For the better part of a half-century, the blond actress had
lived in Los Angeles, where she appeared in 56 movies and 178
television episodes of ``Private Secretary'' and ``The Ann Sothern
Show.'' In recent years a resident of Sun Valley, Idaho, she
returned to her old home town to bask in newfound glory: her
Academy Award nomination as supporting actress for ``The Whales of
August.''
   How did she hear the news?
   ``I was sound asleep, and what woke me was the sound that a
telephone makes when it's off the hook. So I hung it up, and the
phone rang immediately. It was a friend of mine from here, and she
said, `I suppose everybody in the world has been calling you.' I
said no, the phone was off the hook.
   ``She said, `Well, you did it! You got a nomination!' That's how
I learned. Then of course the phone didn't stop all day.''
   She had never thought of herself as an Oscar contender during
her long years in the studios _ ``until this year at least, my type
of work (comedy) was not considered very important for awards. But
of course my performance in `Whales' is not comedic.''
   She was cast as the flighty neighbor of sisters Bette Davis and
Lillian Gish, neither of whom was nominated despite early
predictions.
   ``I'm an old method actress,'' Miss Sothern said. ``Anyone who
has studied (Konstantin) Stanislavski (the Russian actor, director
and teacher) understands you do preparation for the part. What
intrigued me most was that the name of the character was Tisha.
That's my daughter's name. I thought, Lord, there must be some
reason for them to have sent me this part.
   ``I liked the role very much, and I realized it wasn't too much
for me. She was very capricious, very flirtatious. I thought the
red wig I wore was very good for the character. I did the part
about two decibels above my regular speaking voice, and I was
adamant about doing a Yankee accent.''
   About the reports of a feud between legends Davis and Gish:
   ``Lindsay Anderson (the director) is a very strong man, and he
kept things in hand. I think he and Bette had a few tiffs, but I
had no problems. I happen to be a diplomat as well as a tough lady,
and I think Bette respected that. Besides, we've known each other
for a long, long time.
   ``I had never even met Miss Gish, and I was in awe to be in the
presence of this beautiful and talented legend. So we got along
well.''
   Miss Sothern shuns mention of age, but the record books show
that she was born Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., and began
her film career in the 1929 sound musical ``The Show of Shows.''
She is heavier than in her MGM heyday and walks hesitantly, the
result of a long battle with ill health including a broken back.
But her mind remains as lively as ever.
   She marks her film beginnings with the 1933 musical ``Let's Fall
in Love.'' That's when Columbia boss Harry Cohn changed her name
from Harriet Lake to Ann Sothern, reasoning that there were too
many Lakes in movies.
   ``The movie almost killed me,'' she said, recalling the years
when actors could be worked 12 hours a day, six days a week. ``I
decided then that I would never work after 5 o'clock, because there
is just so much you have to give. And I never did.''
   The actress moved on to RKO and in 1938 to MGM, which she still
remembers with great fondness: ``We were the last of the MGM
`babies' _ myself, Ava Gardner, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Van
Johnson, others. I had Greta Garbo's dressing room, next to Greer
Garson's and Joan Crawford's. We were pampered, and we loved it.''
   At MGM she starred in seven ``Maisie'' films, sang the
Oscar-winning ``The Last Time I Saw Paris'' in ``Lady Be Good'' and
played the Ethel Merman role in ``Panama Hattie.'' In the early
1950s she was felled by hepatitis.
   ``I was immobilized for a couple of years,'' she recalled.
``When I recovered, I realized I had to prove that I was still able
to work. So I went back to the theater and did a play with Robert
Cummings for seven months. When I came back, my agent said,
`Something new is happening, and you ought to get into it.'''
   The ``something new'' was television, and the two series created
a whole new audience. Reruns of the shows are broadcast on
Nickelodeon on cable TV.
   Six years ago Miss Sothern moved to Sun Valley, where she had
skied since the early 1940s.
   ``It's a fairyland,'' she rhapsodized. ``Beautiful, clean air _
we're at 5,600 feet _ and it's a healthful atmosphere; everybody
skis. Yes, it can also be boring, but I'm thinking of becoming
involved in a new theater up there.''
   She was married to two actors: Roger Pryor (1936-42) and Robert
Sterling (1943-49).
   ``They were not happy marriages, and I decided not to marry
again,'' she sighed. ``I made a mistake. But then, I always was too
independent.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Radical Move, Dude</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GROTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a Matisse hanging in a Cambridge
subway station that has nothing to with fauvism, impressionism or
any of the other labels commonly associated with the name.
   Most Matisses appeal to the eye. The subway Matisse _ 16 massive
aluminum chimes and teak-tipped hammers suspended between the
tracks at the Kendall Square stop _ pleases the ear with a majestic
sound that comes when a handle from the platform is pulled.
   Henri Matisse is considered one of the most influential
20th-century artists. His boldy colored canvases that typify the
fauvist movement hang in famous galleries worldwide. Fauvism was a
French expressionist movement that involved such artists as
Matisse, Vlaminck and Derain and utilized strong, bold colors and
distorted forms.
   His grandson, Paul Matisse, is less famous. He doesn't paint,
but since setting up the chimes of ``Pythagoras'' last October, he
is cherished by hundreds of commuters who have left their scribbled
comments on a pad near the handle.
   ``I am getting a Proustian rush: Is this normal?'' reads one. A
less profound comment says simply: ``Radical move, Dude.''
   Others have viewed his functional mobiles at New York's Museum
of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the National
Gallery of Art in Washington; the Musee d`Art Moderne in Paris; the
Bienalle in Vienna; and at other U.S. and foreign galleries.
   Matisse, whose father, Pierre, is a well-known art dealer in New
York, lives and works in a former Baptist church in Groton _ a
sleepy town about 50 miles northwest of Boston _ with his wife,
artist Linda Hoffman, and their two children.
   He talked about himself and his grandfather during a recent
interview in his workshop _ a clutter of drill presses, lathes,
jigsaws and other tools he wields to create works that titillate
the imagination through movement, sight and sound.
   As a boy visiting Paris for summer holidays, Matisse sat
frequently for his grandfather and has recollections of him as ``a
terrifying presence.''
   ``When he looked at you to draw you, you were looked at,'' he
said. ``He was like a 50,000-watt search light.''
   Matisse bears some physical resemblance to his grandfather. He
now does not seem to suffer from the burden of living up to such a
famous heritage.
   It was not always so.
   ``What happens is in a lifetime you go through a whole series of
responses,'' he said with a chuckle. ``So you go through a negative
response. I've gone beyond that, and I feel a very positive
appreciation of the fact that he was back there.''
   But he is at pains to emphasize the obvious _ there is no
similarity between his works and that of his grandfather, who died
in 1954.
   ``When he drew a line, he drew a line he wanted to draw,'' he
said. ``He knew exactly what he wanted to do, and I remember him
telling me that his hand was his servant, and I don't work that way
at all.
   ``I have to draw (while drafting), so I do. But it's not so much
that, it's just that I don't have a great love of color and form,''
the 55-year-old artist said. ``I have a great love of ideas, which
is different entirely, and I think I'm much closer to Duchamp in
respect.''
   Matisse's kinship with Marcel Duchamp, the famed French artist
who began challenging traditional art concepts during the early
years of this century, goes beyond a love for the unusual. Duchamp,
who died in 1968, was Matisse's stepfather.
   Matisse, an acknowledged authority on Duchamp, referred several
times to one of his stepfather's most controversial works _ a
common urinal entitled ``Fountain,'' which shocked the art world of
his time. He hinted at a common bond in describing DuChamp as an
ideas man.
   ``I said Duchamp because Marcel rebelled against `painterly
art,''' he said, commenting on artistic influences. ``He wanted art
with intelligence.
   ``Duchamp said things like `bete comme un peintre' (stupid like
a painter). ``The influence I treasure from him is his point of
view.''
   While mentioning that Duchamp frequently expressed support of
his creations, Matisse emphasized that he is very much an
individual, personally and artistically.
   ``I am delighted that I was as close to him as I was,'' he said.
``But his character was very much his character and in no way does
mine reflect his.
   Although expressing reluctance to characterize his own art,
Matisse alluded to his creative philosophy in comments on
``Pythagoras.''
   ``The important part is to do whatever your spirit wants, and
... when you hang up a bell or tube, you do not get beautiful
sound,'' he said.
   ``I was able to do all that, so why should I be jealous of my
grandfather's ability to draw lines?''

   Rick Astley is attracting more attention with
his first album than he probably expected to have in a lifetime.
   It has been 20 years since England sent America anything like
Astley _ when Joe Cocker arrived sounding a lot like Ray Charles.
   Astley's RCA album, ``Whenever You Need Somebody,'' and the
first rhythm and blues sounding single from it, ``Never Gonna Give
You Up,'' have shot up the best-selling charts in Europe and then
followed the same pattern in the United States where the LP went
gold.
   Besides getting a superhit with a first record, Astley excites
interest because he's quite a surprise. His voice is super-soulful,
deeply resonating, mature-sounding _ and he's a 21-year-old English
lad with a diffident air, chestnut hair and freckles.
   ``There's so much that gets crammed in,'' Astley said during an
interview at RCA headquarters.
   ``Private life is one thing I don't get, basically, any more.
Today we're a little rushed and that seems to be the norm these
days. I don't see my family any more. I don't mean to moan about
it. I knew I was letting myself in for this. I realize little
things in life become suddenly important and you miss them.
   ``It's very nice traveling to all these countries. All the same,
at the end of the day, all the RCA offices look the same.''
   Astley was born in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England _ not
far from Liverpool. Like many performers, he started as a teen-ager.
   ``I took up drums around 15,'' he said. ``I actually liked
drums. With friends, a guitarist and bass player, we got a band
together. One has gone to college now, studying computers. One is
married.
   ``It was a fun thing. The bassist was doing most of the writing.
We played anything that had three chords. We disbanded out of a
mutual agreement sort of thing.''
   Then Astley at 17 was asked by a band named FBI to be its
drummer. ``It was in the same little town,'' he said. ``Anybody who
can play an instrument; everybody seems to know about them. It was
an all-guitar band. Nobody could afford keyboards.
   ``I started to write most of the material about six months after
joining,'' he said, ``so I progressed on to be the singer as well.''
   The band's managers _ one of whom still manages Astley _ invited
Peter Waterman, who owns production and publishing companies, to a
performance. ``The band was still very young; I was one of the
oldest and I was 19,'' Astley said. ``He offered me a solo deal
which I ended up taking.'' FBI continues and Astley says they're
still friendly.
   ``I went to work for Pete for eight months or so. I was a tape
operator in a studio. It's computerized these days. I made tea a
few weeks until I saw how a studio works. Then I started recording
in December 1986, three songs. One was `Never Gonna Give You Up,'
the first single. I was writing like mad, doing demos weekends and
nights, learning whatever I could, getting to know everybody.''
   Later, Astley played guitar on one track of the album, ``No More
Looking for Love.''
   ``We did that at 2 or 3 in the morning,'' he said. ``Nobody was
around. The guy producing said, `You do it.' I always play on my
own demos. I said, `Fine. I can get by on this.'
   ``I'm not stupid enough not to know there are better musicians
than me. I'm not going to get into an ego trip when I play; time is
money in a studio. I'd like to do it when I get older.
   On ``Never Gonna Give You Up,'' Astley said a few notes are
high. ``It sounds as if it is low. I'm not saying that to be hip
and cool. I prefer to sing lower; it feels better and suits better.
   ``I think I've always had this sort of tone to my voice. A lot
of my favorite singers are black guys. In Britain, music by people
like Luther Vandross, James Ingram and Michael McDonald becomes
part of the Top 40. I like a white artist's voice with a soulful
approach.''
   PWL, which Waterman runs with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, is
mainly known in the United States as the power behind Bananarama
and Samantha Fox.
   ``It is almost like a mini-Motown,'' Astley said. ``They
produce, write and arrange for so many people, some not big in
America but massive in England. They may have five singles they've
written and produced in the Top 20 on the British charts in one
week.
   ``They tend to have a very controlling role. Everybody says they
have a sound. I wondered what style they were going to use for me.
It was a little more musical than some of the stuff they'd done, a
return almost to the '70s, with string arrangements. I don't sound
like most of what they do.
   ``We've recorded `Ain't Too Proud to Beg' by the Temptations. I
sang it live in a few clubs in London. Everybody seems to think
it's the strongest thing I've done and that's my direction. It's
like rhythm, and me singing. It seems to show my vocal ability to
its best. I did it slower than the Temptations did it. My voice
suits slow; I think you can express yourself a little more.
   ``We were going to put it on the first album but didn't want to
put all the eggs in one basket,'' he said, ``and a lot of people
lately have released old Motown songs. I've got all these thoughts
buzzing around in my head. You've got only 10 songs to bring to
people.''
   The album includes five songs by Stock, Aitken and Waterman,
four by Astley and ``When I Fall in Love,'' the Nat ``King'' Cole
hit.
   ``I'm only 21,'' Astley said. ``As years go on, hopefully I'll
get into writing all of an album and producing some of it. It's
still early days for me.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: ``S.'' Is for Sarah, Updike's Saucy Scarlet
Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is no accident that the cover of John
Updike's new novel consists entirely of an oversize scarlet letter.
   ``S.'' (Knopf, $17.95) is a contemporary spin on Nathaniel
Hawthorne's classic tale of adultery. It is also a lighthearted
send-up of the New Age fascination with Eastern religions and a
poignant study of the dynamics of marriage through Updike's
ever-wise eyes.
   ``S.'' is actually Updike's third telling of ``The Scarlet
Letter.'' His 1975 novel, ``A Month of Sundays,'' was the Rev.
Dimmesdale's version in modern dress; his last novel, ``Roger's
Version,'' portrayed the cuckolded husband, Roger Chillingsworth.
Sarah Worth, the protagonist of ``S.,'' finally tells us Hester
Prynne's side of the story.
   Updike talked about his 13th novel during a recent visit to New
York from his Beverly, Mass., home. Wearing a writer's gray tweed
jacket and exuding boyish energy, the 56-year-old Pulitzer Prize
winner sat behind a desk in a vacant office at his publisher's,
fidgeting with a paper clip and pondering why he is so captivated
with the subject of adultery.
   ``It fascinates a lot of novelists. Somebody once said that
without adultery you don't have the novel. It used to be ... the
only way in which a woman became a revolutionary. It was a
high-energy transaction. It was the way in which marriage, which
was the basis of the bourgeois social order, was betrayed,'' said
Updike.
   For men, the author noted, adultery was part of the social
order: ``There were mistresses built into the system. There were
brothels built into the system, so that in a way the male adulterer
does not seem to be as conflicted or as passionate or as troubled
or as vulnerable a creature as the adulteress.''
   In ``S.,'' Sarah, a middle-aged New England housewife, flees her
inattentive doctor husband (after taking amply from their joint
bank accounts) to join a religious commune in Arizona that bears
more than a passing resemblance to the now-dismantled Rajneeshpuram
in Oregon. Her imperial air and Seven Sisters pedigree quickly gain
her entrance into the guru's inner circle, where she becomes a kind
of personal secretary and bookkeeper.
   ``There is a way in which Sarah is a `wicked woman,' kind of
selfish and heedless and cavalier; she's no saint,'' Updike said of
his protagonist. ``But there is a way in which Hester Prynne is not
a saint initially either. When we see her as a young woman, she's
kind of sassy, really.''
   Asked if the reader is supposed to like Sarah, this ``wicked
woman,'' Updike laughed and replied shyly, ``It'd be nice if you
would. I'd be grateful. I like her ... because she's energetic and
also purposeful. She's no slouch. Tossed out into the world she
does pretty well in it.
   ``I think what we like in fiction is life. And the novelist's
hope is to imbue the characters with life rather than virtue.
Dickens had a nice way of getting us really enthusiastic about
virtuous characters. I'm not sure that in the late 20th century we
can make people that pure.''
   Updike, born in Shillington, Pa., educated at Harvard
University, and a Massachusetts resident for the past three
decades, has published 19 other books _ collections of poems,
essays and short stories _ in addition to the novels. He is also
the foreign books reviewer for the New Yorker.
   The author has mined a prolific career out of his study of
male-female relationships. He is probably best known for creating
the ribald Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom in 1960's ``Rabbit, Run,''
bringing him back a decade later in ``Rabbit Redux'' and again in
1981's ``Rabbit Is Rich,'' which won him a Pulitzer, an American
Book Award and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
   Updike has come under fire for his handling of female characters
in the ``Rabbit'' trilogy as well as some of his other work. In a
recent New York Times interview he said he wrote ``S.'' to satisfy
his ``feminist detractors.''
   ``I'm almost sorry I used that phrase,'' Updike said. ``In fact,
women tend to review my books more understandingly and kindly than
men. In `The Witches of Eastwick' (with three female protagonists)
the women reviewers were much more amused with it than some of the
men. ... But I suppose I was impressed by the feminist point that
many women in my books have tended to be dependent and seen to a
large degree as sex objects. So in my clumsy way I'm trying to make
female protagonists who are the center of the action.''
   ``S.'' is an epistolary novel, in which the story is told
through letters Sarah writes to her husband, daughter, mother,
friends, even her dentist and hairdresser. The convention usually
doesn't allow for dialogue but Updike cleverly circumvents this
constraint by having Sarah conceal a tape recorder in her clothes.
   Although the epistolary form has built-in limitations, Updike
said, ``It's a blessing in a way because it spares you some of the
carpentry work of the third-person novel.''
   ``I've always been a realistic writer who treasures getting the
furniture and clothes right. I had to abjure a lot of that detail.
Probably good for me, sort of a cleansing operation.''
   Even in a breezy satire such as ``S.'' Updike's prose is
luminescent. He is America's premiere stylist, writing with a
precision and lushness that borders on the rococo in his
descriptions of the Arizona terrain or of Sarah's beloved New
England garden.
   Updike was once called a ``creator of moral fables.'' He was
asked if that label fit.
   ``I think of my books as being more moral investigations,'' he
said. ``I try to raise the question of what is morality and what is
goodness, more than to offer a definition. I think any novel to be
alive must fluctuate somewhat in its moral standpoint; maybe
fluctuate is the wrong word, but it should have ambiguity built
into it. It should make the reader think a bit, surprise him a bit,
make him investigate his own life, rather than present him with
villains and heros and a good way and a bad way.''

   Are we going to see Harry Angstrom again?
   Author John Updike was recently asked that question while
plugging his new novel, ``S.''
   ``Yes. I hope, if I keep my wits and live a few more years, to
write one more Rabbit novel,'' said Updike, interviewed on his 56th
birthday and perhaps feeling intimations of mortality. ``I look
forward to it, in fact, and it's the next novel on my schedule.''
   Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom, Updike fans know, is the protagonist
of the author's Rabbit trilogy.
   When we first met Harry in 1960 in ``Rabbit, Run'' he was a
26-year-old MagiPeel salesman in Brewer, Pa., still coasting on his
glory days as a high school basketball star _ that's how he got his
nickname Rabbit because he was fast on the court. The book's sexual
candor made it a sensation.
   In 1971's ``Rabbit Redux'' Harry, now a typesetter, links up
with a flower child and a black revolutionary. In ``Rabbit Is
Rich,'' which won the author a Pulitzer, Harry has reunited with
his wife, Janice, and becomes prosperous almost by accident when he
takes over his father-in-law's Toyota dealership at the height of
the 1970s gas crunch.
   Harry Angstrom, who has has become as much a part of the
American literary iconography as Holden Caufield, is Updike's ode
to the American male. He is a philanderer and a flirt, sometimes
chauvinistic and a little bit of a jerk. Yet Updike has imbued him
with a magical quality that elevates him. Harry is the embodiment
of grace; he has an innocence and an optimism that is enduring. We
forgive him his weaknesses; we are charmed by his foibles.
   Updike said he had not yet started writing the fourth book.
   ``The reason I haven't started it _ I'm kind of itching to get
going on it, as a matter of fact, and I have a few ideas _ but the
books have all taken place in the ninth year of the decade,
sometimes the 10th. They kind of by accident, then on purpose, wrap
up the decade. So I have to give it another year to see what the
country's going to do,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to overemphasize that side of the books. They're
not just meant to be headline blotters. But on the other hand some
topical constituent has always been there ... and in some sense
Harry is a typical American and the headlines go on as a kind of
background. So there's always been a link between him and the life
of the nation. And I have to see what happens, what will be the
post-Reagan era.
   ``Rabbit is the only novel on my horizon and I think it'll take
a while. I don't want to rush it. I'd like it to be worthy of the
series, and in a way, cap it.''
   Will Rabbit practice safe sex? Did he lose his shirt in the
stock market crash? Have yuppies inflated real estate prices in
Brewer? We'll find out in 1990.

   Less than a month before the filing deadline,
fewer than half of Americans have finished their tax returns. But
refunds are bigger, the IRS is doing a better job answering
questions, and taxpayers are making fewer mistakes than had been
expected.
   The Internal Revenue Service is almost 3 percent behind last
year's pace in processing returns, but blames that chiefly on
taxpayers' slowness in filing this year. Officials say there is
nothing to signal a repeat of 1985 when faulty computer programs

   More than $2 trillion in Japanese savings accounts
loses its tax-free status this week, and executives from Tokyo
investment firms to foreign manufacturers are dreaming of tapping
into the treasure trove.
   The April 1 change was prompted by complaints from allies that
Japan needs to spur domestic consumption as a way to recycle some
of its $82.7 billion annual trade surplus.
   The hope is the new 20 percent tax on interest will encourage
Japanese to save less and spend more. But many experts do not
foresee that happening.

   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
in European trading early today after closing at its lowest level
in three months in Tokyo. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the Bank of Japan intervened to
prop up the American currency but not enough to halt the dollar's
slide in Europe.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell for the third consecutive trading day, dropping
1.31 yen to a closing 124.43 yen. The dollar now has fallen 2.72
yen in three trading days in Tokyo to its lowest level since Jan. 4.
   In later London trading today the dollar was quoted at 124.38
yen.
   The Bank of Japan intervened shortly after the start of trading
to prop up the dollar at 124.40 yen to 124.45 yen, traders said.
One of the central bank's currency dealers, Taeko Kobayashi, said
the bank bought between $100 million and $200 million.
   Traders in Frankfurt said the amount of the Bank of Japan's
intervention was apparently insufficient to withstand the selling
pressure from market operators testng the dollar's bottom level.
   They said the approaching Easter holiday is slowing activity in
trading rooms where a number of traders already have left on
vacation.
   In London, the dollar dropped almost two cents against the
British pound. One pound cost $1.8530 today, more expensive for
buyers than late Friday's $1.8360.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6660 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.3768
Swiss francs, down from 1.3865; 5.6525 French francs, down from
5.6860; 1.8732 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8820; 1,234,75 Italian
lire, down from 1,241.00; and 1.2425 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2433.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $453.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $451.70. Amid quiet trading at
midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $453.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $453.20, up from $451.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 59 cents from Saturday's close
to a bid $454.67.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.63 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.64.

   The dollar fell today for the third consecutive
trading day in Tokyo, closing at its lowest level in almost three
months, while stock prices recovered from sharp losses over the
weekend.
   The dollar closed at 124.43 yen, down 1.31 yen from Friday's
finish of 125.74 yen, after opening the day's session at 124.60.
The currency ranged between 124.30 yen and 124.63 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 2.72 yen in three trading days. Its
close today was its lowest since 121.65 on Jan. 4.
   ``Japan is taking the cue from trends overseas like New York,''
said Taeko Kobayashi, a currency dealer with the Bank of Japan.
``Japanese fundamentals are changing and that explains a weaker
dollar here.''
   The Bank of Japan intervened shortly after the start of today's
trading to prop up the dollar at a level of around 124.40-124.45
yen, traders said.
   While the move failed to prevent a further decline, it did help
to steady the dollar. Ms. Kobayashi said the central bank bought
$100 million to $200 dollars.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which shed a hefty 305.99 points in Saturday's
half day of trading, recovered most of its losses, rising 301.99
points, or 1.19 percent, ending the day at 25,622.71.
   Traders said the market was active as investors were preparing
for the new fiscal year.
   Large issues such as steel and shipbuilding, as well as pulp and
paper, were traded actively in the first section, where the overall
volume was estimated at 1.1 million shares.

   Senate budget writers get their shot this week
at crafting a $1 trillion fiscal 1989 federal spending plan, an
exercise that normally causes fur to fly but this year should be
relatively tame.
   With 1988 an election year, a truce has taken hold in what is
usually a three-way budget battle among the White House and
congressional Democrats and Republicans.
   The reason is last fall's budget summit pact between Congress
and the administration, an accord that settled most of the fiscal
fights well in advance. Lawmakers are showing no inclination to
reopen the usually wrenching decisions about taxes and military and
domestic spending that the summit has already made.
   ``There are enough hopeless endeavors here without taking on
another,'' said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., a member of the
Senate Budget Committee.
   The budget panel scheduled meetings beginning today to write the
spending plan for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. Committee
members say they expect their work to be completed as early as
Tuesday or Wednesday.
   In a rare show of bipartisan unity, the House approved a $1.1
trillion budget last Wednesday. There, as in the Senate, the only
real question left for the lawmakers to decide was how to divide up
the $169.2 billion the summit accord allows for domestic programs
that Congress directly controls.
   When President Reagan sent his budget proposal to Congress last
month, he asked for a $2.4 billion increase in space and science
programs. The House slashed that figure in half to help finance a
batch of other programs that Reagan sought to eliminate or reduce,
such as subsidized housing, mass transit aid and energy
conservation grants.
   The Senate budget panel, however, is likely to be much more kind
to science. In part that's because the committee is chaired by
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida, home of Cape Canaveral,
and the senior Republican is Pete V. Domenici, whose home state of
New Mexico houses some large federal laboratories.
   ``There's no doubt you'll see science and NASA and futuristic
things, we'll push that up, which means other things have to be
restrained,'' Domenici said Friday.
   Lawmakers and aides of both parties concede that there is little
support among senators for eliminating programs as the president
has proposed. So to finance those programs and to pay for large
increases in science, education, the homeless, AIDS research and
the fight against drugs, the budget panel will have to find savings
in a wide range of domestic programs.
   Budget committee members and staffs of both parties have been
meeting in efforts to sound out differences and forge preliminary
agreements. Final decisions on how to spread the pain of spending
cuts around have yet to be made.
   The Senate, like the House, will write a budget using economic
assumptions prepared by the White House's Office of Management and
Budget.
   The use of those projections, generally more optimistic than the
forecasts of private economists, helped the House compose a budget
with a projected 1989 deficit of $134 billion. That would avoid the
automatic spending cuts that would occur under the Gramm-Rudman
budget balancing law if the deficit should exceed $146 billion.
   If lawmakers chose to use projections by their own non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office _ which are far gloomier than those by
OMB _ they would be staring at an estimated deficit that would grow
by $35 billion and raise the possibility of enormous spending
reductions.
   Some legislators say the administration's figures have as good a
chance to prove accurate as CBO's. Others say using administration
numbers will mask the true extent of the red ink, but concede that
there is no stopping Congress from using them and postponing real
deficit reduction until a new president comes to town next year.
   ``It is irresponsible, isn't it?'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C. ``But what can you do? I'm waiting on January.''

<TEXT>
   Prices steadied in light trading on the London
Stock Exchange by midday Monday after dropping sharply during the
morning session.
   Several traders said they were encouraged by the slight recovery
from the market's morning lows. But they also were waiting for the
New York market's next move.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected stocks
was down 15.1 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,752.8 at midday. During
the morning, it was down 19.5 points.
   Volume stood at 212.6 million shares at midday, down from 221.6
million shares at about the same time Friday.
   Traders said activity again appeared to be limited to
market-makers.
   ``Most of the fund managers are busy writing reports'' ahead of
the end of the first quarter, commented one trader.
   ``I can't see anyone wanting to do much before the Easter
holidays.''
   The market ignored the 301.99 point gain made Monday in Tokyo's
Nikkei stock index and instead focused on the possibility of
another bearish run on Wall Street. On Friday, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 44.92 to 1,978.95, its second 40-plus point
loss in two days.

<HEAD>Koppers Discussing Selling Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. Chairman Charles R. Pullin says
the entire building materials and cement company may be sold to
counter a takeover attempt by Beazer PLC.
   Pullin said in a written statement Sunday that discussions
concerning a possible sale are being held with ``certain third
parties.'' Koppers spokesman Robert J. O'Gara declined to elaborate.
   Koppers has rebuffed Beazer ever since it appeared on the scene
about three weeks ago with a $45-a-share offer. Beazer sweetened
the bid March 19 to $56 a share, or $1.52 billion, which Koppers
characterized as inadequate.
   Before going to shareholders Friday with its latest
$60-per-share tender offer, about $1.7 billion, the British
construction and buildings materials company tried to negotiate a
friendly deal at the same price with Koppers management.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is an equity partner in the Beazer
takeover bid.
   Pullin said Koppers' board of directors has instructed
management to work with the company's financial advisers to
consider alternatives to a takeover.
   Those alternatives include a recapitalization that maintains the
company's independence, the acquisition of the firm or a portion of
its assets by another party, and the purchase by Koppers of a stake
in another company, Pullin said.
   A consortium of banks had agreed to lend Koppers about $1
billion to finance a recapitalization, which would likely involve a
one-time cash payout to shareholders.
   ``We're progressing in the work that we're doing to counter this
takeover,'' O'Gara said.
   Up to now, company officials had been firm in their desire to
remain independent.
   Beazer spokeswoman Lissa Perlman declined comment. Company
officials have said previously they would sue Koppers if the
company sold some or all of its construction materials and services
businesses as part of a recapitalization.
   Beazer sees the acquisition of Koppers as a strategic step
toward establishing a worldwide building materials empire.
   Separately, the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles late Friday
granted Koppers an order that prohibits BNS from buying Koppers
stock until April 4, at which time Koppers will argue for a
permanent order to block the tender offer.
   Koppers had asked the court to halt the tender offer for
antitrust reasons. But Beazer had agreed to sell Koppers' aggregate
plant in Los Angeles, if the deal were consumated, to satisfy the
Justice Department's antitrust concerns.
   Beazer believes the temporary order has no practical impact on
the tender offer since the offer remains open through April 7 and
no shares can be purchased until that time, Ms. Perlman said.

<HEAD>CFTC Approves Moving Limits On S&P 500 Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, seeking to
subdue wild price swings on the nation's financial markets, has
adopted an unusual method for limiting daily price moves on its
Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures.
   The exchange said the adjustable limits will take effect today,
replacing the 30-point limit the Merc adopted for the contract
after the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   The new limits, approved Thursday by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, will range from 15 index points to 25 points.
This will depend on the settlement price of the lead-month S&P 500
futures contract on the last business day of the preceding month.
   Investors use stock-index futures to hedge against losses in the
stock market.
   S&P 500 futures account for more than 80 percent of all U.S.
stock-index futures trades.
   Merc officials have said the limits will result in better
coordination of U.S. financial markets, a key recommendation of the
presidential commission that investigated the stock market collapse.
   A one-point move in the S&P 500 index is roughly equivalent to
an eight-point move in the Dow Jones industrial average. Some
analysts had criticized the 30-point limit on S&P 500 futures _
equivalent to about 240 points on the Dow _ as being too high to
curtail all but the most violent price swings.
   A 15-point limit will take effect today because the June
contract settled February 29 at 268.75 points, within the low-end
range of 0 to 275 points.
   The limit would increase to 20 points if the June contract
settled above 275 points on the last trading day of March, or to 25
points if the June contract settled above 325 points.

   The stock market opened lower in edgy trading
today in the wake of Friday's 45-point drop in the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials.
   The closely watched blue chip average was down 11.44 points at
1,967.51 in the first half-hour of trading. Declining issues
outpaced advances by around 6-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 949 issues falling, 159 gaining and 338 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was about 26.3 million shares.
   Traders had been looking anxiously toward today's opening on
Wall Street after Friday's tumble, which closed out the worst
trading week so far this year.
   The bearish sentiment deepened overseas earlier today when the
dollar came under pressure and stock traders in London ignored a
turnaround on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange index of 100 selected stocks was down 15.1 points, or 0.9
percent, at 1,752.8 at midday. During the morning, it was down 19.5
points.
   ``This opening was kind of pre-ordained,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., referring to Wall
Street's initial activity.
   Wachtel said traders don't expect another ``Black Monday'' in
today's session, however, anticipating that prices will stabilize
after initial losses. The Dow's historic 508-point plunge on Oct.
19 had followed sharp losses on the previous Friday.
   ``The market's pretty well sold out; it's just that there are no
buyers around,'' he said.
   The NYSE composite index was off 1.07 at 145.51.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.92 points to
1,978.95, finishing the week with a net loss of 108.42.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 377 up, 1,149 down and 431 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 163.17 million shares, down from 184.91 million in
Thursday's session.

   Stock prices steadied at lower levels in edgy
trading today as bearish sentiment spilled over from last week, the
worst trading week so far this year.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off
9.45 points at 1,969.50 at 11 a.m. EST. The key index fell 44.92
points on Friday and 43.77 points on Thursday.
   Ten stock issues declined in price for every three that rose on
the New York Stock Exchange in the early going.
   Analysts had expected further downward movement following the
losses late last week.
   Stocks succumbed to additional pressure from a softer dollar,
which continued to fall against major foreign currencies in Europe
after closing at its lowest level in three months in Tokyo.
   Despite the bearish sentiment in the equities market, traders
did not expect another ``Black Monday'' in today's session, said
Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Dow's historic 508-point plunge on Oct. 19 followed sharp
losses on the previous Friday. But Wachtel said market participants
anticipated the market would settle down after initial losses today.

   A drug that could save your life may
be hiding right now in a bit of ordinary seaweed.
   So could chemicals that could produce better crops, kill
dangerous pests or clean toxic wastes. They just haven't been
discovered yet.
   ``We're essentially land creatures. That's why we've focused on
land plants. But the sea, chemically, is a very different
environment, and you will find many new and different things
there,'' said Kenneth Terry, vice president of Ocean Genetics Inc.
   The young company 60 miles south of San Francisco wants to be
the first to find, develop and perhaps market some of the
potentially valuable products that may be lurking in seaweed and
other forms of marine algae.
   In hundreds of glass dishes and flasks in its laboratories or
huge bubbling tanks in seaside greenhouses, Ocean Genetics is
growing, studying and testing more than 300 species of the simple
plants.
   Algae, which range from one-celled organisms to large, familiar
seaweeds, already are used to make many things, including
stabilizers, thickeners and texturizers important in the food and
cosmetic industries and gels essential to science and medicine.
   Two of those gels are agar _ the familiar culture medium in
petri dishes _ and its purer, electrically neutral form, agarose,
which is criticial for many research procedures.
   There are no substitutes for either, producers are few, and
demand keeps growing. That means a profitable opportunity for Ocean
Genetics, which plans later this year to market agar and agarose
it's now producing and testing.
   ``Agar and agarose provide us with the steppingstone I felt was
necessary for Ocean Genetics to find and develop other product
lines,'' said company president and founder Wayne Harvey.
   Those yet-undiscovered products are the primary, though
long-term, goal of the company, the company officials said in
recent interviews.
   ``The highest potential is for pharmaceutical and animal health
care products. But I think the potential of agrichemicals, in
particular natural pesticides ... and plant-growth regulators also
are signficant,'' Harvey said.
   Bay Venture Group, which provided Ocean Genetics $200,000 in
seed capital when it was formed in 1981 and other financing since,
is pleased with the privately-held company's progress and is
optimistic about the future.
   ``It has all the characteristics of a successful business,''
said BVG general partner Bill Chandler, also a director of Ocean
Genetics. ``I think the company is going to be a major pioneer.
   ``And of course, there's a saying that while pioneers get shot
in the back, they also get to claim the new land.''
   Once it identifies new chemicals, Ocean Genetics will be able to
grow the algae they come from very quickly, Harvey said.
   That's primarily because the company combines engineering
knowledge with plant physiology and biochemistry and will avoid
``the vagaries of nature'' by raising large monoculture crops of
proven plants in indoor tanks, he said.
   But the process begins in a Santa Cruz laboratory filled with
hundreds of petri dishes and seething carboys filled with large
pieces of brown, red and green algae.
   The specimens, collected all over the world, are cleaned and
small pieces are put in the petri dishes, where they grow for
several months. Then they are transferred to the carboy containers,
where for another six to nine months they are kept in purified,
nutrient-rich salt water.
   ``Some of them are just incredibly beautiful. Look at the lace
of the leaf of this plant,'' said Harvey, displaying a specimen
whose delicate russet network was revealed by the strong light
behind its container.
   ``Once we have found an organism that produces a product, we do
extensive studies ... to find out how we can control its
environment to maximize the production and the quality of what
we're interested in,'' Harvey said.
   Controlling reproduction, screening cells for mutations and
cloning are some of the methods the company can use to increase and
improve desirable qualities, he added.
   Ocean Genetics' first research product, phychobiliproteins,
already are being produced and tested. The naturally flourescent
chemicals found in certain seaweeds can be used in medicine to tag
some types of cells. Someday they may replace radioactive tracers
now used to study and treat diseases like cancer and AIDS, Harvey
said.
   ``These little puppies are worth $10,000 to $15,000 a gram ...
wholesale,'' he said, holding a test tube of glowing purple liquid.
   After growing in the carboys, some plants are freeze-dried and
sent to one of several pharmaceutical, chemical or biotech
companies, which test the samples for possibly valuable substances.
   But other promising varieties are ``grown up'' and studied
further in several stages in computer-controlled tanks inside
greenhouses on land the company leases from the University of
California-Santa Cruz, Terry said.
   Reaching into one tank, Terry pulls out a handful of material
that looks like reddish-brown steel wool _ a plant whose origin or
possible future use he and Harvey good-naturedly refuse to reveal.
   ``This is a unique opportunity,'' Terry said. ``It's about as if
we were able to start over on land. The sea is a whole fresh
resource.''

<HEAD>Pennies Make Cents In Greeneville</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By LEANNE WAXMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerry McDowell makes a whole lot of
cents.
   McDowell heads the plant where most of the nation's pennies are
produced, though the U.S. Mint finishes the job by stamping shiny
blanks with their slogans and Abraham Lincoln's profile.
   McDowell knows just about all there is to know about the
nation's 1-cent piece. He's learned most of it since 1981, when the
U.S. Treasury Department gave up penny production and assigned the
task to Ball Corp.'s Zinc Products Division in Greeneville.
   Pennies used to be made almost entirely of copper, but
skyrocketing prices for the metal sent the federal government in
search of cheaper materials and lower operating costs in the
private sector.
   McDowell and other Ball officials convinced the Mint they could
do the job in Greeneville, and the nation's copper-plated penny
over a zinc base was born.
   ``They very quietly introduced this thing and nobody much knew
there was a change,'' McDowell said. ``There was one helluva a lot
of testing before they switched over.''
   The old pennies were 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc. The
new pennies are 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper, he said.
   The Mint first wanted to go to all-aluminum, but aluminum was
very light and trouble was anticipated with vending machines.
Federal officials then thought about an all-zinc penny, but zinc is
silvery like other coins and tarnishes quickly, McDowell said.
   ``Ball came up with the idea to plate zinc with copper,'' he
said.
   The phase-in from old penny to new took a year, he said, with
the 42-acre plant shipping new pennies in 1982 for the first time.
   About 70 percent of the nation's pennies are made in
Greeneville, or about 8.5 billion blanks under the government's
$18.2 million contract with Ball for 1988. A much smaller operation
in La Salle, Ill., also makes penny blanks under a small business
set-aside program with the government.
   Ball Corp. reported net income in 1987 of $66.3 million on sales
of just over $1 billion, said Tom Jenkins, an accountant in Ball's
Muncie, Ind. headquarters. That compared with income of $58.9
million on a similar sales total in 1986.
   The government ships zinc and copper to Greeneville and the zinc
is melted down, cast at a rate of 35,000 pounds an hour and rolled
into thin sheets, coiled 13,000 pounds at a time, then pressed into
penny shapes and rimmed before copper is added during a series of
electroplate and cleansing rinses.
   The process takes about two hours, and the longest time spent is
electroplating, McDowell said. Each blank penny weighs about 2.5
grams, and 181 pennies weigh a pound as opposed to 145 pennies a
pound of the old, mostly copper cents.
   ``Zinc is less dense than copper,'' McDowell said.
   The pennies are turned from a sleek silver to a shiny copper
color during their electroplating baths. After they're dried and an
anti-tarnish material is added, the blanks are checked for quality
before they're shipped to Mints in 3,300-pound wooden crates lined
with plastic.
   ``When they're new, they want them to look new,'' McDowell said.
   A federal law prohibits the government from spending any more on
making a coin than the face value of the coin, which means pennies
must be made with all costs included for less than a cent each.
   When copper prices went as high as $1 a pound in the early
1970s, the government was spending a full cent per penny to
manufacture the coins itself. In the late 1970s, copper cost as
much as $1.45 per pound. Ball is now making pennies, and they're
finished off by the Mint, at a total cost of sixth-tenths of a
cent, McDowell said.
   The Mint coins the pennies in Philadelphia and Denver after
they're shipped from Greeneville by rail and truck.
   Ball cranked out about 12 billion penny blanks in 1982, the
first year of full production, because the government feared there
would be a penny shortage when the word got out copper was no
longer going to be the primary material.
   The government ordered so many pennies that year and in 1983
because officials were jittery after people took silver coins out
of circulation in droves around 1965, when the mint stopped using
silver for dimes, quarters and half-dollars.
   No similar penny shortage occurred, however, and the government
later cut back production in Greeneville so the inventory that had
built up could be depleted, McDowell said. Penny production has
been steady since 1987.
   The Greeneville plant employs about 300 people, with the
facility also manufacturing casings for batteries and other
zinc-based products.
   The Mint still makes all other coins itself and likely will
continue to do so, McDowell said.
   Security is not extraordinary at the Ball plant since the
pennies are shipped as blanks, he said. Besides, vending machines
don't take pennies anyway so criminals aren't much interested,
McDowell said.
   ``How are you gonna peddle them?'' he said. ``They're blank.''

   The stock market was lower in moderate trading

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States fell by eight this week to total 935, Baker Hughes
Inc. announced.
   In the previous week, the count lost three rigs to total 943. A
year ago, the count totaled 748, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker company, tallies
the number of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched
industry index of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas gained nine rigs,
while Wyoming and California each gained three and North Dakota
gained one. Louisiana and New Mexico each lost five, Pennsylvania
lost four, Michigan lost three, Ohio and Oklahoma each lost two,
and Colorado lost one.
   The rig count in Kansas was unchanged.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Appeal of West Virginia Coal Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to study the
appeal of a coal company that saw its property tax assessment for
some 7,400 acres of land in Webster County, W.Va., soar from
$488,000 to $12.3 million in one year.
   The justices said Monday they will decide whether the increased
assessment represented ``systematic and intentional''
discrimination against the Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co., a
subsidiary of Allegheny Power System Inc.
   The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the assessment
by a 3-2 vote last July 17.
   The justices today also granted a separate, similar appeal from
three other coal companies owning land in Webster County.
   Allegheny Pittsburgh bought the land, in numerous tracts, in
1974 for about $24.6 million.
   The total assessed value assigned to all the tracts of real
estate was $488,000 in 1975. But that assessment was raised in 1976
to $12.3 million, half the 1974 purchase price.
   Allegheny Pittsburgh challenged the new assessment, and repeated
that challenge for each tax year through 1982.
   The company sold the real estate, along with the mineral rights
attached to it, in 1982 to East Kentucky Energy Corp. for $29.8
million.
   The proper assessment in 1984 was raised to $14.9 million to
reflect 50 percent of the 1982 purchase price.
   County officials testified that all recently sold property was
assessed at 50 percent of its sale price. They also testified that
property not sold during the same six-year period received
comparatively modest assessment increases.
   A state trial judge ruled that Allegheny Pittsburgh's assessment
increase violated the state constitution and the equal protection
guaranteed by the federal Constitution's 14th Amendment.
   But the state Supreme Court of Appeals reversed that ruling.
   In a separate appeal granted review today, East Kentucky Energy,
Oneida Coal Co. and Shamrock Coal Co. challenged the way Webster
County formulates property tax assessments.
   Their appeal noted that recently sold property is being assessed
and taxed ``at a level as much as 6,500 percent higher than
properties stipulated and found to be comparable in every pertinent
respect.''
   East Kentucky Energy is a subsidiary of Shell Oil Co. Oneida
Coal and Shamrock Coal are both subsidiaries of Sun Co. Inc.
   The cases are Allegheny Pittsburgh vs. County Commission of
Webster County, 87-1303, and East Kentucky Energy vs. County
Commission, 87-1310.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures opened slightly higher while
grains opened steady to lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices advanced on the government's offer to donate
soybean oil to Pakistan, and also on news that a drought in the Rio
Grande du Sul region of Brazil had prompted the government there to
declare a state of emergency, analysts said.
   Some rain fell over the weekend in Brazil after the declaration
was issued, however, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller
& Co.
   Farmer sales of corn over the weekend put pressure on corn
futures prices; wheat opened slightly lower on expectations of a
pickup this week in the amounts of surplus wheat sold at government
auctions, Gidel said.
   But wheat futures were trading slightly higher about a half-hour
into the session.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.06\ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to } cent lower with May at $2.09} a bushel; oats were { cent lower
to \ cent higher with May at $1.69 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents
to 3\ cents higher with May at $6.51\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .28 cent higher with April at 75.20
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with March at 82.80 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .57 cent
lower with April at 45.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.27 cent to .72 cent lower with May at 56.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

<HEAD>American Stores Launches Tender Offer For Lucky Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   American Stores Co. today launched its
$1.74 billion tender offer for Lucky Stores Inc., a $45-a-share bid
that would create the nation's largest grocery store chain if
successful.
   ``That is correct,'' said American Stores Vice President Michael
Holt, confirming that the offer to Lucky stockholders began this
morning. He refused to comment further.
   Lucky, the country's sixth-largest supermarket chain, boasts
annual sales of about $7 billion, with 480 stores in the West,
Midwest and Southwest, mostly in California and Arizona. American
Stores, with annual sales of $15 billion, has about 1,700 retail
outlets in 40 states, making it the nation's third-largest grocery
retailer.
   Lucky officials at the company's Dublin, Calif., headquarters
referred calls to New York spokeswoman Lissa Perlman. She confirmed
the tender offer had begun, saying Lucky officials have been
reviewing the offer with financial and legal advisers.
   ``Lucky strongly advises its stockholders not to take any action
with respect to the American Stores offer'' until the Lucky board
of directors has a chance to further study the bid and make its
recommendation, Ms. Perlman said.
   No deadline for a recommendation was given.
   Wall Street reacted to news of the bid by sending Lucky Store's
stock up 87{ cents per share to $48.62{ per share at midday on the
New York Stock Exchange. American Stores down $1.87{ per share, at
$54.75 per share.
   American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs notified Lucky Stores
Chairman John M. Lillie of the then impending tender offer in a
March 21 letter. Skaggs said if the offer was successful, he
planned to combine American Store's Alpha Beta stores with Lucky's
operation under the Lucky name.
   The letter praised Lucky's management and marketing strategies
and invited Lucky executives to stay on if the deal is completed.
Lucky's headquarters would remain in Dublin, Skaggs said.
   The bid for Lucky comes 16 months after a takeover specialist
Asher Edleman dropped his hostile effort to acquire the company. In
return, Lucky agreed to pay his $2.8 million in legal bills.
   Lucky kept Edleman at bay partially by selling off non-grocery
divisions and adopting anti-takeover measures.
   After the text of the letter was released last week, Lucky
officials had no comment on the American Stores' tender offer
except to say company bylaws contain a ``poison pill''
anti-takeover provision limiting the voting power of any
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.
   American Stores last made financial headlines in 1984 when it
spent $1.1 billion to take over Jewel Companies Inc., a
Chicago-based grocery, drug and convenience store chain.
   That acquisition expanded American Stores' operations from just
over 1,000 retail outlets to its present 1,700. The company has
three divisions _ Skaggs, which operates supermarkets in the
western United States; American Superstores, which runs outlets in
the Midwest and East, and Osco Drug Stores, which has stores
nationwide.
   The company operates stores under the names Acme, Jewel, Star,
Buttrey, Skaggs, Skaggs Alpha Beta, and Osco Drug.

   The stock market was broadly lower in light to
moderate trading early today, amid continued anxiety stemming from
Friday's market drop and pressure from a declining dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was unchanged at
1,978.95 at noon EST, after trading about 9 to 10 points lower
through much of the morning. The broader market continued to
decline, however. Losing issues outpaced advances by around 10-to-3
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,069 issues falling, only 320
gaining and 403 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 70.43 million shares, down from
74.55 million shares traded by noon on Friday.
   ``There is an enormous amount of bearish sentiment out there,''
said Michael Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. He noted that
Wall Street has been gripped recently by a ``buyers' strike'' led
by foreign investors and large financial institutions.
   Stock prices are being pressured by the weak dollar, which fell
anew today on world currency markets. The U.S. currency was quoted
at about 124.15 Japanese yen at around noon today, down from 125.30
yen late Friday in New York.
   The dollar had also retreated to around 1.6600 West German marks
from 1.6760 marks.
   The financial markets have been ``reminded that stabilizing the
dollar is not going to be easy,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice
president of First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   The NYSE composite index was off 0.65 at 145.93.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 2.76 to 291.88.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal in New Jersey Hazardous-Waste Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by companies seeking refunds of New Jersey taxes they paid
to help clean up hazardous waste.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could limit
the amount of the refunds.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in December that the
businesses are entitled to only a partial refund if the state
Legislature does not appropriate enough money to reimburse them
fully.
   The case stems from a dispute over New Jersey's so-called Spill
Fund and whether it was preempted by the federal Superfund law.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986, in an earlier review of
the New Jersey case, that the Superfund preempted _ at least
partially _ state efforts to deal with hazardous waste pollution
through taxation.
   The high court said states only may tax the same companies
subject to the Superfund law for purposes not covered by the
federal act.
   Congress then removed the preemption feature from the Superfund
law to eliminate the potential obstacle to state clean-up programs.
   At issue in the case acted on today is the size of the refund
the companies are entitled to recover for the period before the
preemption feature was eliminated.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court interpreted the 1986 U.S. Supreme
Court rulig to allow the state to retain part of the taxes the
companies paid for clean-up costs.
   The state court said that if the New Jersey Legislature failed
by June to reimburse the Spill Fund for the full amount of
preempted expenditures, the businesses are entitled only to a
partial refund.
   The Spill Fund was created in 1977, supported by tax revenues
that average about $10 million a year.
   The $1.6 billion federal Superfund was created in 1980 and
renewed in 1986.
   Seeking the refunds are Exxon Corp., B.F. Goodrich, Union
Carbide, Monsanto and Tenneco.
   They said the New Jersey court ruling would permit the state
illegally to retain millions of dollars in tax revenue.
   The case is In Re Exxon Corp., 87-1296.

<TEXT>
   There are few disputes more vociferous than
those on how Uncle Sam, along with his nieces and nephews in
smaller governmental entities, earn their income and spend their
money.
   Every taxpayer has an opinion. Every business, too. Tax reform
and watchdog groups exist in most municipalities. Presidential
candidates can't steer clear of the subject. Congress tinkers with
it every year.
   Academics write books about taxing and spending. Institutions
exist for the specific purpose of studying every detail of every
proposal. Pressure groups and lobbyists are in a constant uproar
about their favorite projects.
   Here's a sampling:
   The poor are being nickeled and dimed to death by state sales
taxes, says Citizens for Tax Justice. Sales taxes are regressive,
says the public interest organization's director, Robert S.
McIntyre.
   As a share of income, he states, sales and excise taxes take
five times as much from poor families _ and three times more out of
middle-income families _ as they take from the rich.
   ``Taxing the poor heavily is both curel and inefficient,'' he
says. ``It doesn't produce much in the way of revenues, because the
poor don't make very much money.''
   Progressive taxes, based on the ability to pay, are the answer,
he says. He suggests a sales-tax rebate plan to mitigate some of
the regressivity of such taxes, which some states impose even on
food, gasoline and utilities.
   The Center for the Study of Economics in Columbia, Md., pushes
what it calls incentive taxes as a way to generate revenue, while
simultaneously improving the economic base of a municipality.
   It's not a new idea, having been proposed many years ago by
economist Henry George. In fact, some municipalities have accepted
the notion, but not enough of them according to the center, which
proselytizes with missionary zeal.
   One of its tenets is that the value of land was created by
society and government. Nevertheless, taxes on undeveloped land are
almost always far below land on which an investor has placed a
building.
   In short, downtown parking lots pay low taxes and contribue
minimally to the area's economy in terms of jobs, payrolls and
products. But lots with structures on them and job-producing
businesses in them are taxed more heavily.
   They ask if the opposite policy wouldn't be more productive?
Shouldn't that parking lot be forced to develop itself into a more
economically productive role? How better to do it than by taxing it
into compliance?
   No discussion of spending and taxing could be so boisterous as
to drown out J. Peter Grace, who headed the President's Private
Sector Survey on Cost Control, said by the White House to have
saved $40.5 billion in fiscal 1988.
   Now head of Citizens Against Government Waste, Grace is
currently circulating his notions of how Uncle Sam can reduce the
budget deficit by $60 billion a year.
   He claims, for instance, that $6 billion could be saved in three
years by establishing a bipartisan commission to recommend an
extensive program of military base closings.
   An additional $1 billion could be saved over three years, he
says, by imposing user fees for non-emergency Coast Guard Services,
such as getting a tow if your outboard runs out of fuel.
   Earlier this month, the President's Management Report said
recommendations by the Private Sector Survey led to savings of
$30.6 billion in fiscal 1986 and $38.9 billion in fiscal '87, for a
three-year total of $110 billion.
   ``They still haven't gone far enough,'' said Grace in handing
Congress his new proposals.
   Never at a loss for money-saving ideas is the Heritage
Foundation. This year, as in years before, it is suggesting that
big savings are possible by ``privatization'' _ turning various
functions over to the private sector.
   This can be accomplished, it says, by selling off assets such as
the federal loan portfolio and the Naval Petroleum Reserve; by
contracting out services that it now tries to handle by itself; and
by further deregulation.
   If Heritage had its way, public housing would be privatized, a
private air traffic control system would be developed, and Amtrak,
the passenger rail service, would be sold to private operators.

   American farmers won't get all the new business if
Japan opens its market to more agricultural imports, Japanese
commentators said on the eve of a visit to Washington by the
Japanese agriculture minister.
   ``If Japan can import freely, there is always Australian beef,
and fruit from other countries,'' which cost less than U.S.
products, said Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at
Tokyo's Waseda University.
   ``The United States will suffer. People will buy from cheaper
places,'' said Hirotatsu Fujiwara, a political commentator and
author.
   Takashi Sato, the minister of agriculture, is scheduled to
travel to Washington on Tuesday to seek an easing of U.S. demands
for an end to Japan's barriers against beef and orange imports.
   The current four-year agreement on beef and oranges expires
Thursday. The United States has refused to open negotiations on a
new one until Tokyo draws up a timetable for a complete end to the
quotas. It also has threatened to take the matter to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international forum that
oversees the trade rules agreed upon by its member nations.
   In separate interviews, Fujiwara and Uchida said Japan should
open its market to imported food. But both expressed doubts over
whether ending Japan's limits on beef and citrus fruit imports
would help reduce the United States' huge deficit in its trade with
Japan, which reached a record $59.8 billion last year.
   Japan in recent years has bought almost 20 percent of all U.S.
farm exports, or nearly $6 billion worth in 1986, according to
Japanese government estimates. Japanese officials say the United
States ignores the fact that Japan is the world's largest importer
of farm products.
   But over the years, beef and oranges have become a symbolic
issue in what the United States sees as Japanese foot-dragging in
efforts to solve the trade imbalance.
   Japan's politically influential farm groups say their members'
livelihood would be threatened by an end to the import barriers.
Government officials want market-opening steps taken gradually,
although opinion within the government and ruling Liberal
Democratic Party on how quickly to move still is divided.
   Talks on Monday failed to iron out differences.
   U.S. officials say the barriers mean Japanese consumers pay two
to four times what their American counterparts pay for beef and
citrus fruit.
   The quasi-governmental Livestock Industry Promotion Corp. says
American square-cut chuck beef had a wholesale price here of 831
yen a kilogram (about $3 a pound) last month, while a similar cut
from Australia had a wholesale price of 757 yen a kilogram ($2.74 a
pound). Retail prices are substantially higher.
   Australia has made plain that it will seek to ensure that any
Japan-U.S. agreements on beef are not made at Australia's expense.
   Under the expiring agreement, Japan raised its annual quota for
high-grade beef imports from the United States from 31,000 tons in
1983 to 58,400 tons in 1987, while raising its quota on orange
imports by 1,100 tons a year.
   Meanwhile, it raised its overall quota for beef imports from
141,000 tons in 1984 to 177,000 tons in 1987.
   In fiscal 1986, which ended last March, Japan imported 188,000
tons of beef _ including 63,000 tons from the United States and
113,000 tons from Australia. Of its orange imports, 99 percent came
from the United States.

   International Business Machines Corp. leads
Forbes magazine's list of the nation's most valuable companies for
a fourth consecutive year, the magazine said Monday.
   IBM's stock market value at the end of 1987 was $69.0 billion, a
decline of 5.2 percent from a year earlier. That was still enough
to surpass Exxon Corp., whose stock market value rose 4.5 percent
to $52.6 billion.
   IBM, the world's largest computer company, has led the Forbes
list since 1984, when American Telephone & Telegraph Co. fell off
the top of the heap because of the breakup of the Bell System.
   Among the big movers in the top 10, Merck & Co. Inc., the
Rahway, N.J.-based pharmaceutical company, climbed to sixth from
ninth. Ford Motor Co. ascended to ninth from 15th, while General
Motors Corp. fell to eighth from fifth.
   Stock market value is determined by multiplying the price of a
company's stock by the number of its shares.
   Here are the top 10 companies in Forbes' market value list,
which will appear in the ``Forbes 500s'' issue of April 25.
   1. International Business Machines Corp., $69.0 billion, down
5.2 percent.
   2. Exxon Corp., $52.6 billion, up 4.5 percent.
   3. General Electric Co., $39.8 billion, up 1.6 percent.
   4. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., $29.0 billion, up 8.2
percent.
   5. Du Pont Co., $20.9 billion, up 3.5 percent.
   6. Merck & Co. Inc., $20.8 billion, up 23.2 percent.
   7. Philip Morris Cos. Inc., $20.2 billion, up 18.2 percent.
   8. General Motors Corp., $19.1 billion, down 9.0 percent.

lingering anxiety about Wall Street's own strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 7.46 points at
1,971.49 at 2 p.m. EST, after declining initially and then
stabilizing at around midday. The broader market posted substantial

<HEAD>Bill Would Required Bonding For Travel Agents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COCONUT CREEK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flood of travel scams has pushed
two Florida legislators to propose a law that would require bonding
for travel agents, a plan that gained the support Monday of state
Attorney General Bob Butterworth.
   Travel agents would be required to register with the state and
post bond ranging from $10,000 to $25,000, unless they already are
bonded by Airline Recording Corp., under the proposed measure.
   Butterworth endorsed the bill at a news conference at the
Coconut Creek Government Center.
   ``When bogus holidays are offered by deceptive telephone
promotions, the reputation of Florida as an ideal vacation destiny
is damaged,'' he said.
   His office launched a major investigation of travel scams last
June with raids on eight offices. Complaints naming more than 200
other travel companies are under investigation.
   ``Fraudulent travel providers who fast talk customers in
telephone promotions are being brought to justice,'' Butterworth
said.
   Although the bill would add regulation, it has picked up
industry support.
   ``The professional is concerned to make sure the traveling
public does not get bilked, and I think the professional also is
concerned he doesn't want the reputation of the industry impugned
by scam operators,'' Harold Berns, a member of the board of
directors of the American Society of Travel Agents, said Monday.
   ``The professional travel agent is more than happy to see this
happen,'' said Berns, owner of Air and Sea Travel in Fort
Lauderdale. ``We've heard too many horror stories. Not only here,
but all over the country.''
   Tobin and Weinstein charged tour operators who take money from
unsuspecting consumers for trips they will never deliver are a
growing problem.
   A 1985 state law made the fraudulent sale of travel a
misdemeanor. But victims have no way of recovering their money
without bonding, Weinstein said.
   Opposing the bill would ``be like being against apple pie,''
said Berns.
   Most of Florida's 2,200 legitimate travel agents already meet
the bill's requirements by registering with Airline Recording
Corp., which requires bonds of up to $50,000 bond.
   Virtually all travel agents who sell airline tickets must
register with the corporation, Berns said.
   Agents already associated with such a recording association
would not be required to register under the bill, Weinstein said.
But agents already bonded may voluntarily register with the state.
   Failure to obtaing a bond would be a misdemeanor, and the state
Division of Consumer Services would have the power to shut down
unbonded agencies.

<HEAD>Region's Fish Harvest Down But Value Soars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England fishermen returned to port last year
with 12 million fewer pounds of fish and shellfish than in 1986 but
the value of the catch soared 14 percent to $512.6 million,
according to figures compiled by a federal agency.
   Massachusetts led the five states in the region with fishing
industries both in total harvest and value, followed by Maine and
Rhode Island. New Hampshire led Connecticut in terms of harvest
weight, but Connecticut's catch was worth more.
   Gloucester fishermen caught the most fish and shellfish but the
value of the catch was substantially below that of New Bedford
fishermen, whose lucrative harvest of pricey sea scallops made that
port first in the nation in terms of catch value for the second
consecutive year.
   The region's 1987 lobster harvest was virtually identical to the
previous year, 19.8 million pounds compared to 19.7 million pounds
in 1986, but the value of that harvest jumped from $46.2 million to
$54.6 million.
   The preliminary harvest figures were compiled by the Northeast
Fisheries Center, a division of the Commerce Department's National
Marine Fisheries Service. The center compiles the data for an
annual report on the fishing industry nationwide that the Commerce
Department is expected to release in April.
   Commercial fishermen throughout the region caught 543.7 million
pounds of fish and shellfish in 1987, down from the 1986 total of
555.7 million pounds. But because of increased overall fish prices,
the catch value increased from $448.9 million to $512.6 million.
   Massachusetts fisherman harvested 256.8 pounds of fish and
shellfish in 1987, down from 271.3 million pounds a year earlier.
But the value of the Bay State catch jumped 14.4 percent from
$243.6 million in 1986 to $278.9 million last year.
   The Maine catch of 169 million pounds was up slightly from 168.2
million pounds in 1986, but the value of the harvest increased 22
percent from $108.4 million to $132.4 million.
   Rhode Island's catch also remained relatively stable, 100
million pounds in 1987 compared to 101.6 million pounds in 1986,
with the value of that state's catch increasing 3 percent from
$75.1 million to $77.5 million.
   New Hampshire fishermen caught 9.3 million pounds of fish and
shellfish last year, up from 7.9 million pounds in 1986. The value
of the harvest increased nearly 26 percent, from $6.2 million to
$7.8 million.
   Connecticut had the smallest regional harvest in terms of
weight, 8.6 million pounds, but it was worth $16 million, an
increase of 2.5 percent from $15.6 million in 1986, when that
state's total catch was 6.7 million pounds.
   In terms of weight, Gloucester led the region's major fishing
ports with a catch of 92.6 million pounds, followed by New Bedford,
Point Judith in Narragansett, R.I., Portland, Me., Rockland, Me.,
Boston and Newport, R.I.
   New Bedford fishermen harvested about half of the 18.2 million
pounds of sea scallops caught in New England in 1987, according to
fisheries center spokesman Ron L. Schultz.
   The average price of $4.42 a pound paid to fishermen for sea
scallops was by far the highest of the 14 major species of fish and
shellfish harvested in New England waters. The average price paid
to fishermen for lobster was $2.91 a pound.
   The price paid to Gloucester fishermen falls far below that paid
to their New Bedford counterparts because two of the major species
harvested by Gloucester fishermen, pollock and Atlantic herring,
net per-pound prices among the lowest of the 14 species.

<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. will buy a 20 percent stake
in Silicon Graphics Inc. for $68.9 million in a step intended to
cement their business relationship, the computer companies said
Monday.
   Minneapolis-based Control Data said it intended to buy $150
million worth of computer workstations from Silicon Graphics over
the next three years, continuing an arrangement with the Mountain
View, Calif.-based company that dates back to late 1986. The
companies will cooperate on developing new workstations.
   Control Data will buy newly issued shares of common stock in
Silicon Graphics at a price of $22.50 a share that will represent
20 percent of the company's stock.

   The stock market was broadly lower in fairly
light trading today, dampened by new declines in the dollar and
lingering anxiety about Wall Street's own strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.11 points at
1,967.84 at 3 p.m. EST, widening its early-session losses. The
broader market posted substantial deficits. Declining issues
outpaced advances by around 11-to-4 on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 1,139 issues falling, only 375 gaining and 402 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 118.6 million shares.
   Many investors had their new-found confidence shaken late last
week, when stocks fell sharply on Thursday and Friday. The closely
watched Dow average tumbled nearly 45 points on Friday after
falling nearly 44 points in the previous session _ sparking fears
that today's session could turn into another ``Black Monday'' like
Oct. 19.
   The anxiety was fueled today by fresh declines in the battered
dollar.
   ``We're again hooked to the dollar,'' said Monte Gordon,
director of research for Dreyfus Corp. ``The market continues to
wallow in confusion and uncertainty.''
   Stock prices are being pressured by the weak dollar, which fell
anew today on world currency markets. The U.S. currency was quoted
at about 123.84 Japanese yen at around 3 p.m. EST today, down from
125.30 yen late Friday in New York.
   The dollar had also retreated to around 1.6550 West German marks
from 1.6760 marks.
   The dollar's slump brought the Federal Reserve into the currency
market to buy dollars in a bid to support the currency after it
fell to around 124.00 yen, traders reported.
   The NYSE composite index was off 1.20 at 145.38.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 3.19 to 291.45.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade while most grain futures
retreated.
   Soybeans were supported by news that a drought in the Brazilian
soybean-growing region of Rio Grande du Sul had prompted the
government there to declare a state of emergency on Friday,
analysts said.
   But traders were divided over the extent of damage to the nearly
ripe soybean crop, especially after weekend rains were reported in
the area.
   Nevertheless, most soybean contracts closed at new lifetime high
prices on a combination of fundamental and technical factors with
most players feeling bullish ahead of Thursday's Agriculture
Department reports on spring planting intentions and grain stocks,
analysts said.
   ``Right now, everything seems to be go in this market,'' said
Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Wheat posted substantial losses due to rainy weather in the
Midwest, which was seen as helping out the new crop, said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.99{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.10{ a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 2\ cents lower with May at $1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 4
cents to 10\ cents higher with May at $6.55{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Federated Department
Stores Inc. will move Wednesday to end the bidding war for the
retailer by acting on the final competing purchase offers of R.H.
Macy & Co. Inc. and Campeau Corp., Federated said Monday.
   A committee of Federated's outside directors met Monday to
determine bidding procedures and would inform Macy and Campeau of
those guidelines, Federated said in a statement.
   The board's Wednesday meeting was to be held at an undisclosed
location in New York. Federated has said Edward Finkelstein and
Robert Campeau, the chairmen respectively of Macy and Campeau,
would be allowed to address the directors.
   Macy and Campeau have each offered more than $6 billion to buy
Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer. Macy's bid has the
approval of Federated management.
   In a letter to both suitors, Federated said, ``It is anticipated
that the board will consider and act on the parties' final bids at
a board meeting on Wednesday, March 30. Federated's advisers will
continue to be available to you to discuss all matters.''
   Federated said last week its board would meet this week to
consider Campeau's $6.53 billion offer and a $6.3 billion bid from
Macy.
   Robert Campeau, whose Toronto-based company has been trying
since Jan. 25 to buy Federated, will address Federated's board if
invited, Ms. Frank said.
   ``I'm sure he will go. Nothing's been firmed up, at this
point,'' she said.
   Macy, based in New York, had no comment, said spokesman James
Fingeroth.
   Federated disclosed last week it was negotiating with Macy about
an improved Macy offer, but said there was no guarantee
negotiations would be successful.
   Campeau last week raised its two-step, all-cash offer to
approximately $73 a share from $68 a share, or $6.18 billion.
Campeau offered to pay $82 each for 70.5 million Federated shares
and $37 for the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding
shares in a subsequent merger. Campeau also extended its deadline
until midnight EDT April 4, when Macy's offer is to expire.
   Campeau, a development company that bought Allied Stores Corp.
in December 1986, also proposed an alternate friendly merger under
which it would pay $73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tender
offer and $73 for the remaining shares after the merger.
   Macy has offered $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange
shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities
for the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.
   Federated and Macy have signed a merger agreement under which
Macy would take over Federated in a newly formed, joint company.
   Federated's divisions include Bloomingdale's, Abraham and
Straus, Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department
stores; Ralphs supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main
Street and Children's Place specialty stores.
   Federated has also delayed putting into effect, until at least
Wednesday, a ``poison pill'' amendment to its shareholder rights
plan. That would allow shareholders to buy new shares at a steep
discount and make an unwanted takeover more expensive.

<HEAD>FTC Approves Furr's Purchase of 59 Stores in Safeway's El Paso
Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Monday
approved Furr's Inc.'s purchase of Safeway's 59-store El Paso
division.
   However, Furr's must hold the stores separately pending the
final sale of 12 Safeways in New Mexico and Texas to Jaynes Group
Inc., according to the FTC.
   The Jaynes Group is a newly formed corporation organized by
former Safeway employees. Both it and Lubbock-based Furr's are
privately held and did not disclose the amount of the transactions.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. of New York acquired Safeway in
1986 in a $4.3 billion leveraged buyout to fend off a hostile
takeover by the Dart Group of Maryland. It has been selling off
whole divisions to pay off its debt.
   During the four-month FTC review period, Furr's operated the 59
stores as an autonomous division.
   Furr's now operates 154 retail grocery stores in Texas and New
Mexico. It also operates two distribution centers and several
support offices.
   The FTC's only objection to Furr's purchase of Safeway's El Paso
division was that it would have a monopoly in 12 New Mexico and
Texas cities.
   Furr's reached an agreement with the Jayne's Group to buy the
stores, which are in the Texas cities of Pecos and Fort Stockton
and the New Mexico cities of Alamogordo, Artesia, Clovis, Espanola,
Hobbs, Las Vegas, Lovington, Portales, Roswell and Silver City.

   Stock prices declined broadly today, dampened by
new declines in the dollar and lingering anxiety about Wall
Street's own strength.
   Many investors had their new-found confidence shaken late last
week, when stocks fell sharply on Thursday and Friday. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled around 45 points on Friday
after falling nearly 44 points in the previous session _ sparking
fears that today's session could turn into another ``Black Monday''
akin to Oct. 19.
   But today's decline was tempered by some ``bargain-hunting''
buying at the lower price levels, traders said. They noted, though,
that many foreign investors and financial institutions remained on
the sidelines.
   Although today's losses were more moderate, analysts said they
reflected a bearish sentiment that continues to hang over the
market.
   ``It will take a while before this blows over,'' said Richard
Schmidt, an analyst for Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn. ``We're
testing some lows here.''
   The anxiety was deepened today by fresh declines in the battered
dollar on world currency markets.
   ``We're again hooked to the dollar,'' said Monte Gordon,
director of research for Dreyfus Corp. ``The market continues to
wallow in confusion and uncertainty.''
   The U.S. currency was quoted at about 123.83 Japanese yen in
late afternoon, down from 125.30 yen late Friday in New York. The
dollar had also retreated to around 1.6563 West German marks from
1.6760 marks.
   The dollar's slump brought the Federal Reserve into the market
to buy dollars in a bid to support the currency after it fell to
around 124.00 yen, traders reported.
   The financial markets have been ``reminded that stabilizing the
dollar is not going to be easy,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice
president of First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   Traders are anxiously looking toward Tuesday's scheduled report
on the leading economic indicators for February for a signal on the
economy's direction. Key unemployment data for March is set to be
published on Friday, but stock markets will be closed that day in
observance of the Good Friday holiday.

<HEAD>Irving Adopts New Anti-Takeover Provision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp., which is resisting a $1.08
billion takeover offer from another banking company, said Monday it
took additional steps to discourage hostile bidders from acquiring
its stock.
   Irving said its board of directors approved an amendment to its
share purchase rights plan that would deal with the possibility of
a ``street sweep'' under which a bidder who terminates a tender
offer then begins buying the target company's begins on the open
market or in privately negotiated deals.
   Irving said the provision was adopted to assure that a street
sweep would not jeopardize Irving's efforts to explore alternatives
that would maximize values for its shareholders.
   Bank of New York Co. launched a $60-a-share offer of cash and
securities last week for each of Irving's 18.1 million common
shares outstanding.
   Irving has called the offer inadequate, and indicated last week
that it was seeking a friendly bidder and exploring other
alternatives to thwart the hostile offer.
   The scrap has attracted an unusual level of attention because
hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking business.
   A spokesman for Bank of New York, Owen Brady, said his company
thought the latest provision adopted by the Irving board was
illegal and said it was investigating what to do about it.
   Separately, Bank of New York disclosed that its chairman, J.
Carter Bacot, asked Joseph Rice, Irving's chairman, in a letter to
make sure that Bank of New York gets a chance to look at any of the
confidential financial information that Irving has been sharing
with other potential friendly bidders.
   Under the new move by Irving, the company's previously adopted
share purchase rights plan would be activated if a party who made a
tender or exchange offer subsequently bought enough non-tendered
Irving stock to push its total Irving stake to 5 percent or more.
   If that occurred, each right would entitle its holder to
purchase Irving stock with a market value double the right's
exercise price.
   Bank of New York's tender offer currently is scheduled to expire
April 15.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz Monday said he will
introduce legislation to thwart a hostile takeover of Koppers Co.
by British business magnate Brian Beazer and the Wall Street
investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The Pennsylvania Republican charged again at a news conference
that if a $1.7 billion tender offer from BNS Inc. succeeded, Beazer
will gain a monopoly in the various local markets for aggregates,
road building materials that include the sand and pebbles added to
concrete to make cement.
   ``One of the reasons it's attractive to have a stranglehold on
the existing aggregates business is that environmental laws are
such at the state and local level that you cannot easily open ... a
new source of aggregate,'' he said. ``So in effect it is a sellers'
market for a very very long time.''
   U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Monday he asked Attorney
General Edwin Meese to personally review the Koppers case and to
respond to the request by Thursday.
   Heinz withheld details of the proposed legislation.
   ``To reveal our stragegy might very well be to jeopardize its
success,'' he said.
   The proposal will be offered this week or after the Easter break
in Congress as an amendment to pending legislation, Heinz said. The
proposed law is unlike an amendment sponsored by U.S. Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, to require foreign investors to disclose details
of takeover attempts.
   ``I'm not in the business of making hollow promises, and I do
not make idle threats,'' Heinz said. ``I have drafted and am
prepared to introduce and press legislation to make the takeover of
Koppers extremely unpalatable to Beazer-Shearson and similar
consortiums in the future.
   ``The corporate raiders will be and should be as surprised by
this legislation as Koppers was by this raid.''
   ``We are not corporate raiders,'' Beazer declared in a full-page
advertisement Monday in Pittsburgh's newspapers. ``Our goal is not
to make a quick buck. Rather, we are in the process of creating a
vital, dynamic worldwide organization.''
   Beazer's ad appealed to Koppers' worried employees and to the
city to investigate the fate of the Atlanta homebuilder Cohn
Communities and the Dallas construction materials company
Gifford-Hill after he acquired them in 1985 and 1986 respectively.
   ``Each of those companies has grown and prospered under our
ownership,'' he said.
   Koppers has rejected each of the offers, $45, $56 and $60 per
share, that BNS has made since launching its cash tender offer
March 3. The latest expires April 7, although a federal court in
California has blocked the acquisition over anti-trust concerns.
   Koppers management says it may sell all or part of the company
or pay cash to shareholders to keep the company out of Beazer's
hands.
   Heinz said taxpayers would spend more for public roads if the
takeover succeeds. The combination would heighten Beazer's
concentration in markets where his holdings and Koppers compete.
   ``The two of them combined in what are essentially local market
areas would, if the sale went through, amount to a de facto local
monopoly on very costly road building materials,'' he said.
   The senator, Allegheny County Commission Chairman Thomas
Foerster and others at the news conference warned that the takeover
jeopardizes the approximately 1,100 Pittsburgh-area jobs in
Koppers' chemicals businesses.
   Beazer has said he would sell chemicals and related businesses,
although it is not clear that all those jobs would be eliminated.
   Opponents also worry about the $232 million that Koppers
contributes to the area economy.
   Heinz joined city, county and state officials who have lambasted
Shearson for going a step beyond traditional takeover financing and
becoming an equity partner in the takeover company, BNS.
   ``I am appalled by the involvement of Shearson,'' he said.
``Shearson stands to gain tens of millions of dollars in fees
simply for shuffling some paper around.''
   Shearson officials have said their ownership in BNS is merely a
temporary method of helping finance the takeover.

<HEAD>FDIC Faces First Loss In History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal fund that insures deposits in
commercial banks could suffer a loss in 1988 for the first time in
its 54-year history, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.
William Seidman said Monday.
   Seidman said a loss to the insurance fund, if any, would depend
on how much the FDIC spends to resolve the problems of First
RepublicBank of Dallas, which earlier this month received a $1
billion infusion of government aid.
   The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on real
estate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of the
insurance fund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700
commercial banks.
   Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Seidman said it
is too soon to say with certainty what the cost of restoring First
RepublicBank to health will be. But, he said the $5 billion to $6
billion estimates of some are ``far higher than anything that is
likely to be required.''
   He said the $1.7 billion cost of the 1984 bailout of Continental
Illinois Bank & Trust Co., which was about the same size as First
RepublicBank, ``is the best guide we have.''
   The FDIC's initial outlay on First RepublicBank could be higher
than the ultimate cost, just as it was in the case of Continental
when the agency spent $4.5 billion, Seidman said.
   However, he said the FDIC now usually tries to structure bank
rescues so that the initial cash cost is close to the ultimate cost.
   If the First RepublicBank cost is in the $1.7 billion range and
if banks fail this year at about the same rate as last year, then
``it is possible we will have a loss in 1988,'' he said.
   Last year, a post-Depression record of 184 banks failed.
Forty-four have failed so far this year and Seidman said he
expected the 1988 total to be roughly the same as 1987.
   As failures have increased, the steady growth of the FDIC fund _
from $4.6 billion in 1970, $11.6 billion in 1980 to $17.9 billion
in 1985 _ has slowed. The fund finished 1986 with $18.2 billion and
1987 with $18.3 billion.
   Seidman said the 1988 loss, if it occurs, would be ``something
under 5 percent ... certainly under ... $1 billion.'' He said he
did not see any prospect for what he termed a substantial loss, one
approaching 20 percent, or about $3.5 billion.
   He contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the FDIC fund
with that of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
insures deposits in 3,170 savings institutions. FSLIC was insolvent
until last fall when money began flowing from
congressionally-authorized bond sales. It has had to keep bankrupt
S&Ls open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors.

   The dollar plunged again Monday, piercing key
levels as central bank intervention failed to pull it out of the
doldrums.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $455.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
from Friday's late bid of $452.75 an ounce.
   In a wave that swept westward, the dollar fell in Tokyo before
closing lower in very light European trading. In New York, the
dollar dipped below the 124-yen barrier to finish at its lowest
point since early January in active trading.
   Dealers said the Federal Reserve entered the market to buy
dollars, but the move only served to smooth out the currency's
latest decline, which began last week.
   ``The Fed was not very useful in what you'd call turning (the
dollar) around,'' said Ron Sapiro, head trader at Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago.
   But because the dollar's decline was essentially orderly,
``there was no reason for the Fed to come in en masse,'' he added.
   Traders in Europe were surprised that central banks did not
aggressively step in to support the dollar. ``It's gotten away with
(the decline) because it's been so gradual,'' said a London trader,
who speculated that the central banks would have intervened to
stave off a hastier retreat.
   Traders said the dollar's slide was fueled more by investors'
attraction to other major currencies than by any worries about U.S.
economic factors. ``Everybody's in love with the yen,'' rather than
spurning the dollar, Sapiro said.
   But the yen is not the only currency on the rise. ``All the
high-yielding (major) currencies are benefitting'' from the
market's recent strength, said James McGroarty, a vice president at
Discount Corp.
   Instead of simply selling dollars, traders are jockeying their
deals among several currencies. ``There has been a lot of
cross-playing,'' Sapiro said, albeit at the dollar's expense.
   With most currency markets scheduled to close Friday for the
Easter holiday, traders may already be beginning to square off
their positions, analysts said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell for a third consecutive trading day, dropping 1.31 yen
to a closing 124.43 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted
lower at 124.20 yen.
   In New York, the dollar closed still lower at 123.84 yen, down
sharply from 125.30 yen on Friday.
   The Bank of Japan intervened shortly after the start of Tokyo
trading to prop up the dollar at about 124.40 yen, traders said.
One of the central bank's currency dealers, Taeko Kobayashi, said
the bank bought $100 million to $200 million.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8590 from $1.8360. In New
York, it cost $1.8705 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Friday's $1.84175.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.65615 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.3652 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3865; 5.6130 French francs, down from 5.68625;
1.23715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.24205; and 1,226.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,238.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.6605 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.3705 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3865; 5.6275 French francs, down from 5.6860;
1.8685 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8820; 1,231.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,241.00; and 1.2377 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2433.
   Gold prices jumped higher. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold closed at $455.80 a troy ounce, up from $453.20 on Friday. In
London, gold rose to a late bid price of $454 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $451.70.
   In Zurich, gold also moved higher, closing at a bid $453.50,
compared with $451.50 late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
59 cents from Saturday's close to a bid $454.67.
   Silver closed unchanged at $6.665 a troy ounce on New York's
Comex. In London the metal traded at a bid of $6.63 a troy ounce,
down 1 cent from late Friday.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Hit New Contract Highs On South American Crop
Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The possibility of severe drought damage to Brazilian soybean
crops helped propel U.S. soybean futures prices above $6.50 a
bushel Monday to their highest levels since mid-1984.
   Grain futures retreated in other trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   On other exchanges, copper futures fell sharply while precious
metals were mixed; energy futures advanced; livestock and meat
futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   News that a month-long dry spell in the Brazilian
soybean-growing region of Rio Grande du Sul had prompted the
government there to declare a state of emergency on Friday gave
U.S. soybean futures a healthy boost, analysts said.
   But traders were divided over the extent of damage to the nearly
ripe Brazilian crop, especially after light weekend rains were
reported in the Rio Grande du Sul area.
   Nevertheless, most soybean contracts closed at new lifetime high
prices on a combination of fundamental and technical factors with
most players feeling bullish ahead of Thursday's Agriculture
Department reports on spring planting intentions and grain stocks,
analysts said.
   ``Right now, everything seems to be go in this market,'' said
Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Wheat posted significant losses due to rainy weather in the
Midwest, which was seen as helping out the new crop, said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $2.99{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to } cent
higher with May at $2.10{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2\ cents
lower with May at $1.66} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 9}
cents higher with May at $6.55} a bushel.
   Copper futures plummeted on New York's Commodity Exchange in
reaction to a rise in inventories of the metal at the warehouses of
the world's two largest copper exchanges.
   The Comex reported an increase in warehouse copper stocks of
1,425 short tons to 11,170 short tons. The London Metal Exchange
reported an increase of 425 metric tons to 56,725 metric tons.
   The closely watched March contract was the big loser, tumbling
6.15 cents to $1.076 a pound. Some of that activity was also due to
traders selling out of the March contract before it goes off the
board on Tuesday, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst in New
York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Also on the Comex, gold futures advanced slightly and silver was
nearly unchanged in quiet trading.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $2.80 lower with April at $455.90 a troy
ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.5 cent lower with March at $6.665
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures advanced in slow, featureless trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 7 cents
higher with May at $17.10 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .47
cent higher with April at 48.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .08 cent to .10 cent higher with April at 48.02 cents a gallon.
   The contracts for April and June delivery of live cattle posted
new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Feeder cattle also
advanced while pork futures retreated.
   Higher cash markets underpinned the rise in cattle futures, said
Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Pork-complex prices fell on expectations that the USDA's
quarterly hogs and pigs report will show an increase in the
nation's hog herd of 4 percent to 8 percent from a year ago, Morgan
said.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to .55 cent higher with April at
75.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .73 cent higher
with March at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .33 cent
lower with April at 46.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to .92 cent lower with May at 56.45 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Merc, where the
contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index
settled 2.15 points higher at 259.90. The underlying spot index
finished .45 point lower at 258.06.

<HEAD>IPI, Unions Meet Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of International Paper
Co. and its striking unions met Monday in an attempt to defuse the
hostility that has permeated negotiations during a yearlong
contract dispute and hindered chances of a settlement.
   Both sides declined to release information on what was discussed
or how long they met.
   ``We've agreed that any releases would be joint statements and
only where there's something to report,'' said William Meserve,
president of Local 14 of the United Paperworkers International
Union in Jay, Maine.
   He did say the two sides would meet again Tuesday, and the talks
are expected to last for weeks. IP has paper mills throughout the
country.
   Company spokesman William Greener echoed Meserve's statement,
saying from the company's Purchase, N.Y., headquarters that neither
side intended to release details of the meetings.
   IP and its unions, the UPIU and the International Brotherhood of
Firemen and Oilers, have been at odds for more than a year over
contracts that have come up for renewal. The disagreements focus on
whether local contracts should restore premium pay for Sunday and
holidays.
   Premium pay had been eliminated with labor's approval from past
contracts, but since the industry's fortunes have improved in the
last year, the unions have campaigned to revive the benefit.
   About 3,500 workers in four locations are embroiled in contract
fights. In Mobile, Ala., 1,200 workers have been locked out of
their jobs by the company. An additional 2,300 have struck plants
in Jay, Lock Haven, Pa., and DePere, Wis.
   Contracts are also open in Pine Bluff and Camden, Ark., and
Natchez, Miss.
   IP has continued to operate its mills with replacement workers.
The company claims the strike-breakers are now permanent employees
and has offered assistance to strikers who want to re-enter the job
market, including positions at other IP mills. The unions have
rejected such offers.
   International Paper Co. claimed earnings of $305 million in 1986
and said it expected to post earnings of $407 million when final
figures are released. However, the company said its profitablity
was below the industry average in both 1986 and 1987, when measured
in terms of its net worth.

   A fresh decline in the dollar and lingering
anxiety about Wall Street's own strength pushed stock prices mostly
lower Monday, but the market avoided the sharp falls of the
preceding two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed a scant 0.82
higher at 1,979.77, after posting moderate declines through much of
the trading session.
   But the broader market moved downward. Declining issues outpaced
advances by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with
1,059 issues falling, 468 gaining and 420 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 142.82 million shares, down from
163.17 million in Friday's session.
   Many investors had their new-found confidence shaken late last
week when stocks fell sharply on Thursday and Friday. The closely
watched Dow Jones average tumbled around 45 points on Friday after
falling nearly 44 points in the previous session _ sparking
widespread fears that Monday's session could turn into another
``Black Monday'' akin to the collapse on Oct. 19.
   ``We've been almost rudely reminded that the market is still on
very, very thin ice,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president
of First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``It's still volatile and
vulnerable.''
   But Monday's decline was tempered by some ``bargain-hunting''
buying at the lower price levels, traders said. They noted, though,
that many foreign investors and financial institutions remained on
the sidelines.
   Although the latest losses were more moderate, analysts said
they reflected a bearish sentiment that continued to pervade the
market. And the anxiety was deepened by fresh declines in the
battered dollar on world currency markets.
   ``We're again hooked to the dollar,'' said Monte Gordon,
director of research for Dreyfus Corp. ``The market continues to
wallow in confusion and uncertainty.''
   The U.S. currency was quoted at below 124 Japanese yen in late
trading in New York, down sharply from more than 125 yen late
Friday. The dollar also retreated to around 1.66 West German marks
from 1.68 marks.
   Earlier in the day, the dollar's slump brought the Federal
Reserve into the market to buy dollars in a bid to support the
currency after it fell to around 124 yen, traders reported.
   The financial markets have been ``reminded that stabilizing the
dollar is not going to be easy,'' First Albany's Johnson said.
   Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, Bankers Trust
was down \ at 31}, AT&T fell ] to 26}, Gillette dropped 1| to 45[,
Navistar lost \ at 6] and American Express was unchanged at 24{.
   Shares of Lucky Stores, the object of a $1.74 billion,
$45-a-share tender offer from American Stores, rose ~ to 48|. IBM
advanced 1[ to 108[, while General Electric gained { at 41.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.89 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index was down 0.47 at 146.11.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials slipped 0.45 point to
299.08, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was also down 0.45, at
258.06.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 2.64
to 292.00. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 370.42, down 2.12.

<HEAD>Judge Reserves Decision on Injunction in Advertising Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state court judge reserved a decision Monday
on a request that he prohibit six former top executives of Lord,
Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc. from soliciting business or
employees from Lord Geller for their new ad agency.
   Justice Herman Cahn asked attorneys for Lord Geller, which had
made the request for a preliminary injunction, and for the
defecting Lord Geller executives to work out a plan for introducing
evidence in the case.
   The six executives, led by Lord Geller founding partners Richard
Lord and Arthur Einstein Jr., walked off the job March 18, saying
they felt unduly constrained under the ownership of the British
firm, WPP Group PLC.
   WPP Group, which is headed by Martin Sorrell, had aquired Lord
Geller last summer when he bought its parent, JWT Group Inc., for
$566 million in the biggest ad agency acquisition ever. In addition
to Lord Geller, JWT Group owned the much larger advertising agency,
J. Walter Thompson Co.
   Since the six top partners left Lord Geller to form a new agency
called Lord, Einstein, O'Neill & Partners, about 30 other Lord
Geller employees have quit, some of them signing on with the new
agency.
   Two Lord Geller clients, WNBC-TV and New Yorker magazine, have
indicated they plan to take their business to the new agency.
   But most of the ad world's attention is focused International
Business Machines Corp., the computer giant which reportedly
accounts for about half of Lord Geller's $245 million in annual
billings.

   Four companies seeking to build a
state-of-the-art transportation system in Florida's congested
corridors conjured images Monday of a bullet train that would whisk
passengers at speeds of 150-250 mph along a Tampa-Miami route.
   Company representatives envisioned sleek, high-technology trains
that resembled airplanes in appearance, planned suburbs and cities
springing up along the routes and quiet and comfortable trips
between Tampa and Miami that took only 90 minutes, regardless of
the weather.
   State officials attending the presentations were urged to think
about the tourism boom, the business opportunities and
environmental advantage of having a clean and efficient way of
moving as many as 6 million people along routes between Miami,
Orlando and Tampa every year.
   Legislative leaders seemed to like what they were hearing.
   ``Florida was the first state to have a settlement in the new
world, it was the site of the first moon launch and now it will be
the site of the first truly modern rail system in the world,'' said
House Speaker Jon Mills. ``I think it's symbolic of what Florida
can become.''
   Mills, D-Gainesville, attended the crowded presentation ceremony
in Florida's Old Capitol along with Gov. Bob Martinez, Senate
President John Vogt, D-Merritt Island, and officials of the rail
commission.
   The Florida High Speed Rail Transportation Commission was not
expected to award a franchise until September 1991 to allow time to
study the project and its costs, which could run as high as $5
billion. The train linking Tampa, Orlando and Miami is expected to
be running by 1995.
   State guidelines mandate that the project must link the three
cities, but the applicants will determine precise routes, financing
agreements and the technology they will use.
   The company that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop
property adjacent to the route for rail stations and connecting
attractions. The idea is that those developmental rights will help
the company recoup the startup costs of building the rail system.
   One of the four applicants was TGV of Florida Inc., backed by
the French company Alsthom, which supplies TGV trains to the French
National Railways, and Bombardier Inc., a Canadian manufacturing
consortium.
   TGV's proposal for an electrified system would include trains
that could run up to 185 mph and the cost several billion dollars.
   TGV's big advantage is that the system in France has been very
successful.
   All American MagnePlane Inc. argued that its technology was
newer, faster and cleaner environmentally. The magnetic-levitation
trains, called ``mag-lev'' for short, would glide along a magnetic
field along an elevated track. Because a magnetic force controls
the movement of the train instead of electricity or diesel-powered
engines, company officials said their system eliminates the
dependence on oil.
   That system also is expensive, in the neighborhood of $3 billion.
   Two other companies, the Florida High Speed Rail Corp. and Stone
and Webster Engineering Corp., have proposed plans for systems that
run a little slower, in the neighborhood of 150 mph, and cost less
because they use existing transportation corridors.
   Stone and Webster have submitted the lowest general estimate of
cost, recommending that the system could be built for about $1
billion.
   After judging the proposals on the basis of environmental
effects, financial arrangements, growth patterns and technologies,
the rail commiission can recommend one, or none, of the applicants
to the governor and Cabinet.

   The 17 companies will be in addition to the five in the United

<HEAD>Trader in ``Yuppie 5'' Insider Ring Settles SEC Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former stock analyst who pleaded guilty to a
criminal charge in the ``Yuppie Five'' insider trading scandal,
settled a civil action with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Monday.
   Andrew Solomon, formerly a researcher at the Marcus Schloss &
Co. brokerage, settled civil charges by admitting his participation
in a scheme to trade on inside information of corporate activities.
   Insider trading is the wrongful use of confidential information
to profit in securities transactions.
   The settlement is subject to a judge's approval.
   Solomon, 28, of Manhattan, pleaded guilty June 5, 1986, to one
count of conspiracy. He was sentenced Nov. 26, 1986, to one year's
probation, 250 hours of community service and a $10,000 fine.
   He could have been sentenced to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Solomon was part of a ring that included four Wall Street
professionals and one of their clients, all known as the ``Yuppie
Five.'' They traded in securities involved in six proposed or
anticipated corporate takeovers using non-public information.
   In settling the SEC civil charges, Solomon admitted passing on
inside information about GAF Corp.'s tender offer for Union Carbide
Corp., Dominion Textile's tender offer for Avondale Mills as well
as a takeover bid of American Brands by BAT Industries, all before
they were made public.
   In February, Marcus Schloss & Co. agreed to pay $410,700 _
without admitting or denying guilt _ to settle civil insider
trading charges with the SEC.

<HEAD>USG Urges Rejection Of Desert Partners' Board Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. urged its stockholders Monday to reject
a slate of board candidates recommended by Desert Partners LP and
repeated its opposition to the Texas group's $1.9 billion hostile
takeover attempt.
   In a letter accompanying its proxy statement for the May 11
annual meeting, USG asked its stockholders to elect the slate of
candidates nominated by the USG board to fill six spots on the
15-member panel.
   Desert Partners, meanwhile, announced it had extended until
April 8 its $42-a-share cash tender offer for up to 21.5 million
shares of USG stock. The offer was set to expire Monday at 11:59
p.m. EST.
   Desert Partners, a limited partnership led by Texas oilmen Jack
E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr., had also offered to buy the
remainder of USG's outstanding shares with securities valued at $42
a share.
   Chicago-based USG, a leading producer of gypsum wallboard and
other building materials, told its stockholders that Desert
Partners had reserved the right to cancel its tender offer unless
all of the many conditions set forth in Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations were met.
   If Desert Partners were to win the proxy fight, then drop its
tender offer, ``Desert Partners would have obtained control of 40
percent of USG's Board without paying anything to USG stockholders
or committing to do so in the future,'' wrote Robert J. Day, USG's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Day stated that Brown and Wagner had proposed takeovers of at
least three other public companies in the past but had not yet
acquired any of them.
   Day's letter said Desert Partners' proxy materials did not
disclose whether its board candidates had any experience in
overseeing a large public company ``and did not disclose what the
Desert candidates would do if elected other than support the Desert
Partners takeover campaign.''
   Desert Partners announced the extension of its cash tender offer
in a statement. The Texas group also said it was negotiating for
additional financing in hopes of increasing the number of shares in
the cash tender offer from 21.5 million to 39 million.
   Desert Partners owned a 9.9 percent stake in USG when it
launched the tender offer, and said a ``nominal number'' of shares
had been tendered through the end of last week.

Corp. each raised their bids Monday for International Clinical
Laboratories, a chain of clinical-testing laboratories that is
based in Tennessee.
   Corning moved first, increasing its tender offer to about $360
million, or $35 a share for ICL's 10 million-plus outstanding
shares and common stock equivalents.
   But SmithKline, based in Philadelphia, soon followed by raising
its offer to $37 a share, which it said would amount to about $400
million. It had previously offered $32 a share.
   On Wall Street, ICI's stock rose $1.75 per share to $36.75 in
nationwide over-the-counter trading.
   Corning had started the bidding on March 8 at $260 million.
   Under terms of its merger agreement, Corning would have an
option to buy 3 million unissued ICL shares as well as ``all the
shares owned by certain directors and officers'' for $26 each.
   Henry Wendt, SmithKline chairman and chief executive officer,
said the merger with the Nashville, Tenn.-based ICL would fit with
the pharmaceutical giant's acquistion of Bio-Science Laboratories.
   ``This increased offer reaffirms the strategic commitment to
invest in our key businesses,'' Wendt said. ``Since the merger with
Bio-Science Laboratories in 1985, our clinical laboratories have
made a substantial and growing contribution to the corporation.
   ``This investment will enhance that record of achievement,''
Wendt said.
   The SmithKline offer expires at midnight April 20, the company
said.
   Corning's latest offer, which is subject to federal approval and
is contingent on buying a majority of shares, expires at midnight
April 8.
   In raising its offer, Corning Chairman James Houghton said his
company would not back off from its campaign.
   ``Expansion of our medical-laboratory business is an important
strategic goal, and this acquisition continues to be a very
attractive one for Corning, even at this increased price. We are
determined to complete our agreed-upon merger,'' he said.
   ICL operates 13 major laboratories, mainly in the South and
West, and earned $4.8 million on sales of $205 million last fiscal
year.
   The company would be merged with Corning's own laboratory
subsidiary, MetPath Inc., which is based in Tetersboro, N.J., and
has a dozen other testing labs in the United States.
   Besides laboratory services, Corning makes consumer housewares,
optical fibers and other telecommunications equipment and
speciality glass and ceramics. Last year, Corning had sales of
$2.08 billion.
   SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories, the company's clinical
laboratory segment headquartered in King of Prussia, Pa., operates
22 regional laboratories. It reported sales of $431 million last
year.

   American Stores Co. said Monday it was
prepared to up its bid for Lucky Stores Inc. to more than $1.9
billion in an effort to create the nation's largest grocery store
chain.
   In a letter to the board of the Dublin, Calif.-based company,
American Stores chairman L.S. Skaggs said his company was ready to
offer $50 per share if a ``mutually acceptable agreement'' could be
worked out with Lucky Stores.
   Earlier Monday, American launched a cash tender offer for Lucky
at $45 per share, or a total of $1.74 billion. That offer expires
at midnight April 22.
   ``We made clear our willingness to negotiate concerning all
aspects of our offer, including the price,'' said Skaggs in his
letter to Lucky.
   Skaggs noted that Lucky Stores' representatives had so far
declined the invitation to negotiate.
   The combination of American, the nation's third largest grocery
retailer with 1,700 stores and annual sales of $15 billion, and
Lucky, the sixth largest with 480 stores and sales of $7 billion,
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the country, analysts
say.
   Lucky Stores officials were not immediately available for
comment on the latest developments, which were announced by press
release after the close of stock trading.
   Lucky shares advanced 87{ cents to close at $48.62{, while
American shares lost $1.75 to finish at $54.87{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Before American revealed the contents of its letter to the Lucky
Stores board, Lucky spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said company
officials had been reviewing the offer with financial and legal
advisers since last week.
   ``Lucky strongly advises its stockholders not to take any action
with respect to the American Stores offer'' until the Lucky board
of directors has a chance to further study the bid and make its
recommendation, Perlman said.
   No deadline for a recommendation was given.
   In a March 21 letter, Skaggs notified Lucky Stores Chairman John
M. Lillie of the then impending tender offer. Skaggs said if the
offer was successful, he planned to combine American Store's Alpha
Beta stores with Lucky's operation under the Lucky name.
   The letter praised Lucky's management and marketing strategies
and invited Lucky executives to stay on if the deal is completed.
Lucky's headquarters would remain in Dublin, Skaggs said.
   The bid for Lucky came 16 months after takeover specialist Asher
Edelman dropped his hostile effort to acquire the company. In
return, Lucky agreed to pay his $2.8 million in legal bills.
   Lucky kept Edelman at bay partially by selling off its
non-grocery divisions and adopting anti-takeover measures.
   After the text of the letter was released last week, Lucky
officials had no comment on the American Stores' tender offer
except to say company bylaws contain a ``poison pill''
anti-takeover provision limiting the voting power of any
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.
   American Stores last made financial headlines in 1984 when it
spent $1.1 billion to take over Jewel Companies Inc., a
Chicago-based grocery, drug and convenience store chain.
   That acquisition expanded American Stores' operations from just
over 1,000 retail outlets to its present 1,700. The company has
three divisions _ Skaggs, which operates supermarkets in the
western United States; American Superstores, which runs outlets in
the Midwest and East, and Osco Drug Stores, which has stores
nationwide.
   The company operates stores under the names Acme, Jewel, Star,
Buttrey, Skaggs, Skaggs Alpha Beta, and Osco Drug.

<HEAD>Batus Proxy Fight for Farmers May Violate Law, Regulator Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 4th graf pvs, ``The proposal ... $4.5
billion,'' with Reno court developments, PICKS UP 5th graf

   A proxy solicitation by Batus Inc., which is
making a hostile bid for insurer Farmers Group Inc., may be illegal
and may have to be halted, the Kansas Insurance Department has said.
   The ruling was disclosed Monday by Los Angeles-based Farmers,
which has been resisting takeover overtures by Batus since January.
It was later confirmed by Batus, the American subsidiary of
London-based BAT Industries Inc. PLC.
   At issue is whether a proposal by Batus for which proxies are
being sought would, if successful, constitute a change in control
of the company.
   The proposal seeks to make Farmers' directors reconsider their
previous refusal to negotiate on Batus' takeover offer of $63 per
share, or $4.5 billion.
   Meanwhile, Farmers filed suit Monday in Nevada, where the
company is incorporated, challenging Batus's proxy solicitation.
Farmers claims Batus did not disclose enough information in the
solicitation. An April 13 hearing on the dispute was scheduled in
U.S. District Court in Reno.
   Judge Howard McKibben also said he would decide by Wednesday
whether to declare unconstitutional the Nevada Takeover Act, which
prevents stockholders from taking advantage of tender offers after
the deal is 60 days old.
   The Nevada attorney general's office contends the law is meant
to protect investors from being strung along for months during a
takeover bid.
   But Batus' attorneys argue the Nevada law conflicts with the
federal Williams Act, which gives shareholders the right to
participate in tender offers at will.
   The Kansas Insurance Company Holding Act says no one can take
control of an insurer without first obtaining regulatory approval.
   ``Control shall be presumed to exist if any person ... holds
proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities,''
the law says.
   If the issue isn't resolved or the proxy solicitation isn't
``stopped immediately,'' the regulators said, the department will
be ``required to initiate the applicable administrative or legal
action.''
   The Kansas Insurance Department outlined its concerns in a
letter to Batus dated last Thursday.
   Batus said Monday that it is responding and ``strongly believes
that it will be able to satisfy the concerns raised.''
   Batus is basing its argument on the contention that its
proposal, even if successful, couldn't directly constitute a change
in control of Farmers.
   ``In fact, a change in control cannot result from a vote on our
proxy,'' Batus spokesman Wilson Wyatt said.
   Kansas is one of nine states in which Farmers owns insurers.
Regulatory approval must be obtained in each of those.
   Besides Kansas, where Farmers Group operates Farmers Insurance
Co., and California, where Farmers Group is based, the other states
are Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
   Farmers, in its release Monday, noted that insurance regulators
in Texas, Illinois and Idaho have rejected or found deficient
certain required filings by Batus on grounds that they contained
inadequate information.
   BAT is a tobacco, retailing and paper-goods conglomerate that
for some time has been seeking a foothold in the U.S. financial
services market. Its American subsidiary, Batus, is based in
Louisville, Ky.
   Farmers, with about $11 billion in assets, is the nation's third
largest home and auto insurer, and the seventh largest property and
casualty insurer.
