   A 54-year-old windsurfer was arrested and
booked into jail in a wet bathing suit after she allegedly tried to
use her board to make a getaway from a Florida Marine Patrol
officer.
   Jean Felicia Kuznar, of Jensen Beach, was charged with careless
operation of a vessel, interfering with navigation, resisting
arrest without violence, and fleeing and eluding law officers.
   Her problems with Officer Leslie Jones began when Mrs. Kuznar
was windsurfing Wednesday near the Stuart Causeway and a powerboat
entered the channel.
   Ms. Jones said the powerboat had to ``take evasive action to
avoid an accident,'' so she approached Mrs. Kuznar in her patrol
boat to discuss the matter.
   Ms. Jones said Mrs. Kuznar refused orders that she bring her
windsurfer to shore and ``told me to get lost.''
   Mrs. Kuznar said she was trying to get to shore, and complained
that the officer swamped her with the patrol boat's wake.

   A 71-year-old lawyer has become the
oldest climber on record to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, the
highest peak in North America, the National Park Service said.
   Don Henry of Middlebury, Conn., reached the top of the
20,320-foot peak Sunday in an unusually fast eight days from
Kahiltna Glacier, at McKinley's 7,000-foot level, rangers said
Friday. Records show the oldest climber prior to Henry was 68.
   Henry said he learned of the potential for a mountaineering
milestone when he checked in with rangers before the climb.
   ``So I said, `Thank you very much,''' Henry said.
   Henry climbed McKinley with a guide, Marty Schmidt, and another
mountaineer, Mark Landry, 24, who suffered altitude sickness and
didn't reach the summit until Monday. The three returned to
Kahiltna Glacier, and on Wednesday, they flew back to Anchorage.
   ``I found it extremely arduous above 14,000 feet,'' Henry said.
``It's heavy work.''

<HEAD>Nikkei Rises Slightly After Worst Trading Week This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main market barometer recouped early losses by
the close of half-day trading Saturday, but still finished lower at
the end of its worst trading week so far this year.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a sharp
391.13-point loser Friday, lost nearly 80 points shortly after
trading started, but claimed back lost ground to close the day at
27,301.34 points, up 16.33 points, or 0.059 percent.
   ``The index moved up mainly on profit-taking,'' said Michio
Katsumata, a spokesman for Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage. ``Hitachi and IC-related companies moved higher up,''
but otherwise ``the market was very quiet,'' the spokesman added.
   Shares from Sony, a leading consumer electronics maker, closed
at a historic high 6,460 yen, up 430 yen, surpassing its previous
record close reached Friday.
   Volume on the first section during the half-day session totaled
600 million shares.
   Despite Saturday's slight gain, the Nikkei index closed the week
down 612.45 points, or 2.19 percent, from a 27,913.79-point close
July 15. It had lost 513.09 points during Tuesday trading alone.
   ``People are anxious about higher interest rates,'' said
Katsumata. Banks in Europe and the United States have all raised
their rates, ``but only Japan is sticking to a lower rate,'' he
added.
   The market next week will just move ``up and down, up and
down,'' the spokesman predicted.
   The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart received a
standing ovation from about 2,500 followers Friday at his first
crusade outside his home state of Louisiana since he was defrocked
amid reports he had hired a prostitute.
   The three days of revival meetings were not supported by the
national or local offices of the Assemblies of God, Swaggart's
former denomination. But crowds lined up at the door and sales of
Swaggart's albums and tapes were brisk.
   ``I'm forgiving to him. He's not exempt from sin or
temptation,'' said Etta Mae Martin, 57, of Kansas City, Mo., who
arrived with her husband two hours before the arena doors opened to
grab front-row seats.
   She said Swaggart should put his troubles behind him and get on
with his life.
   ``I wanted to show that men make mistakes, and he's forgiven,''
said Charles Randle, 24, of Indianapolis. ``Since he told the
truth, everyone wants to get on him.''
   In February, Swaggart tearfully confessed on television that he
had committed an unspecified sin against God and his family. The
confession was followed by allegations that he had hired a
prostitute to perform lewd acts while he watched.
   Assemblies of God pastors were told ``not to be supportive or
cooperative with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries any longer,'' said the
Rev. Charles Shank, district superintendent of the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination. ``He has been disciplined by the church
and isn't part of our fellowship.''
   Nevertheless, organizers planned for at least 8,000 followers,
including Assemblies of God members, to attend the crusade each
night.
   As the band struck up an upbeat religious song, Swaggart and his
wife, Frances, kneeled to greet the outstretched hands of members
of the audience who walked up to the stage.
   ``I thank you for your kindness and your love,'' Swaggart said.
``I thank you for literally opposing every force of darkness and
saying, `We love you.'''
   ``It's such a thrill to be here. We love you more than we can
express,'' Frances Swaggart told the crowd.
   Swaggart, singing and playing the piano, appeared in good humor
as he kidded his wife about her fervent address to the audience.
   ``She's always complaining about those women creatures throwing
their hands up. I'm going to show her that on television in a few
weeks, and we'll see.'' The crusade is being videotaped for the
relatively few television stations that have not canceled
Swaggart's program.
   Swaggart didn't refer directly to his troubles Friday night, but
he urged the audience to write checks or give cash totaling $100 or
more to save his television ministry.
   ``We desperately, desperately need that help,'' he said. ``I do
not ask it for me, I ask it for souls.''
   Outside the 17,000-seat downtown Market Square Arena, a handful
of protesters carried signs reading, ``Ban the Bible'' and ``Ban
Christianity.''
   Swaggart said he viewed the crusade in Indianapolis as a fresh
start.
   ``I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal.
``I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'm
more aware of their weaknesses and despair.''
   Swaggart returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year
while undergoing professional counseling. Swaggart, 52, said his
multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such an
absence.
   Jozette Ausbury, a spokeswoman for the Assemblies of God in its
Springfield, Mo., headquarters said members could not be punished
for attending the crusade.
   ``They can go if they want to. That's fine,'' she said.
   The church had not decided whether ministers who attend the
crusade could be punished. The church has not ruled what sanctions
it would apply to local ministers who might help the crusade, but
it has given ministers at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries until Oct. 1 to
leave or be defrocked.
   No local Assemblies of God ministers are known to be assisting
the crusade.
   Baldock, who heads the Compassion Center, Mission on Wheels and
Ark of the New Covenant Church, recruited about 300 volunteers to
serve as ushers, security guards and support staff.
   ``I preach just like most of my brothers preach _ forgiveness,
love and mercy, restoration,'' Baldock said. ``That's not only with
Reverend Swaggart. That's with anyone accepting the message of
Jesus Christ that has a problem. And because I'm forgiven.
   ``The scriptures teach us that if we expect to be forgiven we
must forgive ourselves.''

   They live by a brutal code of each
man for himself in prison, but in the middle of the woods they
learn to stand together against a fiery enemy that is not affected
by their crimes, color or gangs.
   ``We can't bring our problems with us to the fire lines,'' said
Rafael Rojas, 20, of Hollister, who is serving time in the
California Youth Authority for burglary.
   Rojas was among hundreds of state prisoners battling a pair of
arson-linked wildfires in heavy timber and brush near the Calaveras
County town of Rail Road Flat, 150 miles east of San Francisco.
Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday offered a $10,000 reward for the
capture of the arsonist and declared a state of emergency in the
county.
   Nearly 11,000 acres and six homes had been charred by Friday as
firefighters neared containment of the blazes, which have caused an
estimated $3.8 million damage to the drought-parched region since
Tuesday.
   Wielding shovels, saws and other hand tools, state fire Capt.
Bob Segura's strike team of inmates stood guard Thursday when the
fire burned out to a section of the more than 18 miles of
bare-earth control lines that firefighters had carved around the
fires.
   ``Let it burn right to the edge,'' Segura bellowed at the
inmates, clad in orange jumpsuits.
   Some of the inmates had to use ladders off a nearby state pumper
truck to climb up the near-vertical mountain toward the advancing
flames.
   Within minutes, he told his crew from the DeWitt Nelson CYA Camp
in Stockton that it seemed the line would hold for the time being.
   A few of the inmates slid down the slope hand over hand on a
fire hose. Others descended on the ladder. Hours after being dumped
off from a stifling personnel truck, it was finally break time.
   ``This is better than being behind walls,'' Rojas said in an
idle moment.
   Added team member Stevie Wright: ``Every time they ask, `You
want to go on a fire?' everybody stands up and says `Yeah.'''
Wright, 19, of Vallejo, is serving a sentence for possession of
cocaine.
   Inmates in the California Youth Authority or state prison
systems can volunteer to train as firefighters, but candidates are
screened to determine that they are suited and that they are low
security risks. Supervisors are unarmed, but even so there are very
few escape attempts.
   Correctional officer Alex Castillo, supervising state prisoners
in line for food at the Rail Road Flat fire camp after coming off
the lines, said most of the inmate firefighters are proud of what
they do.
   ``They like getting outside and later you hear them say things
like `Hey, we saved a house there,''' Castillo said.
   Added prisoner Myron Bright, with a sincere expression on his
face: ``It's a good way to pay my debt to society.'' Bright, 36,
who is serving time for insurance fraud, works out of the Green
Valley camp near Folsom Prison.
   Castillo said he and other crew supervisors make allowances
because of the nature of the work.
   ``If you're out there for more than a week at a time, they get
antsy. If you're real strict, they won't respond in a good way, and
you don't need tension on a fire,'' he said.
   The inmates said they realize the work is dangerous, but trust
the supervisors to keep them alive.
   One prisoner said the work has changed the direction of his life.
   ``I'd like to become a professional firefighter,'' said Wright.
``The first week I get out, I'm going to put in an application
somewhere.''

   A contaminated water hose in the
kitchen of the Air Force Academy's cadet dining hall apparently
caused the outbreak of food poisoning that affected 673 people,
academy officials said Friday.
   Officials said a floor drain had backed up in the kitchen of
Mitchell Hall on July 12, and the hose was placed in the drain in
an effort to clear it. The hose then was used to rinse celery that
was put in the chicken salad served at lunch that day.
   Bacteriological tests shows the hose was contaminated with E.
coli bacteria. Tests were still being conducted on the food to
confirm that the bacteria in the hose caused the outbreak of
gastroenteritis.
   Academy officials said they planned to have civil engineers
examine the 30-year-old drain system. They also said they planned
to review kitchen procedures, including how food handlers are
trained and supervised.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Pentagon Starting Dangerous Germ Warfare Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group called the Committee for Responsible
Genetics has announced a campaign to persuade university biologists
to turn aside Defense Department requests for additional research
into germ warfare.
   At a news conference Friday, four scientists on the committee
said the Pentagon is asking for $300 million to conduct research
into biological warfare techniques and the researchers said this
work could lead to the development of weapons for a war nobody
could win.
   Christin Anfinsen, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist at Johns
Hopkins University, said biotechnology has advanced so rapidly that
``the production of biological weapons is relatively simple.''
   ``We could develop warheads to spread anthrax (disease) within
six months and so could the Soviets,'' said Anfinsen.
   No nation, he said, could win a war with biological weapons
because a counterattack would be swift and deadly.
   Army Lt. Col. John Chapla, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that
the military is seeking funds to conduct biological research, but
he said the effort is aimed at developing a defense against germ
weapons, not at making the weapons themselves.
   Chapla said a hearing will be held Monday on the environmental
impact of a planned $5.4 million biological aerosol test facility
at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.
   In a telephone interview, Chapla said the Army has let more than
100 biological research contracts to private research groups. The
Army, he said, plans to research defensive measures, such as
protective clothing, and detection and decontamination equipment.
He said Army researchers also will attempt to develop vaccines that
would protect against germ warfare agents.
   But he said none of this work was aimed at producing weapons.
   Chapla also said that for germs to be used as weapons, the Army
would have to develop a delivery system, a way to manufacture the
germs, and a doctrine for the use of such weapons. He said no work
is being done in any of these areas.
   At the scientists' news conference, Jonathan King, a professor
of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the
same techniques needed to develop a defense against biological
weapons can be used to develop the weapons themselves.
   ``In an offensive biological warfare program, the first thing
you do is develop a vaccine to protect your own troops,'' he said.
   King also said the most serious danger of biological weapons is
that they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vast
populations if they are released.
   ``Biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs,''
he said. ``Biological agents can spread and reproduce.''
   Anfinsen said new laboratory techniques, in which the genetic
pattern of bacteria and viruses can be changed, makes a defense
unlikely against germ weapons.
   ``Since you can make any number of variables, the defense
against them is impossible,'' he said. ``The inability to defend
against such an attack is universal.''
   Richard Novick, director of the Public Health Research
Institute, said biological weapons are ``neither a threat nor a
deterrent'' for major powers because all the technically advanced
nations can equally develop such weapons.
   What he fears instead, Novick said, is that the germ weapons
developed by the Pentagon could be used secretly to assert American
will in small countries.
   King and Novick said the Pentagon is actively recruiting
biologists to conduct germ warfare research.
   ``I have been approached and most of us have,'' King said.
   Jane E. Koretz, a researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, said advances in genetic engineering are ``a two-edged
sword.''
   ``It can be used to improve the quality of human life or it can
be used for its destruction,'' she said. Using the new biological
techniques to develop weapons, Ms. Koretz said, would be ``a
perversion'' of the reasons that most scientists conduct the
research.
   She said genetic manipulation techniques could be used to
develop a germ or virus that could spread like small pox.
   ``You can understand why we are so horrified,'' she said.
   The Committee for Responsible Genetics is circulating a petition
among university biologists that contains a pledge not to engage
knowingly in research that would further develop biological warfare
agents.
   A day before the news conference, Kathleen C. Bailey, assistant
director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency of the
State Department, announced that the government believes there now
are at least 10 countries conducting research into biological
weapons.

<HEAD>Iran And Iraq Agree To Peace Talks At U.N.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq agreed to hold crucial peace
talks with the secretary-general early next week on a cease-fire
and a political settlement to end their eight-year war.
   A U.N. cease-fire team planned to leave for Iran and Iraq this
weekend after Iraq finally agreed Friday to accept it. Iran agreed
earlier to welcome the mission.
   Iran formally protested Iraq's latest ground offensive and said
Iraqi chemical warfare attacks had killed dozens and injured
hundreds.
   On Monday, Iran finally accepted Resolution 598, the Security
Council's year-old plan to end the Persian Gulf war. Iraq accepted
it earlier.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart Tariz Aziz agreed to hold separate, intensive talks in
New York with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
implementing the plan.
   After more than a dozen rounds of fruitless U.N. talks, this
round will be the most crucial, diplomats said. Perez de Cuellar
said Wednesday he hoped to have a cease-fire in a week or 10 days.
   It was not immediately known whether the belligerents would hold
direct talks, as urged by Iraq; whether they would hold proximity
talks with Perez de Cuellar shuttling between delegations, or
whether the talks would take place at different times.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told reporters
that Velayati might agree to a face-to-face meeting with Aziz.
Earlier in the week Mahallati rejected direct talks.
   ``Iran is ready to go along without any limitations whatsover in
the implementation of Resolution 598 if the secretary general
requires it,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar says he prefers direct talks, but diplomats
said he was not likely to force the issue.
   Velayati is expected to be here Monday, and Aziz also is
expected to arrive early next week. Previously, Iranian envoys from
Tehran refused to be here while ranking Iraqi officials met the
secretary-general.
   The decision by Iran, militarily battered and politically
isolated, to accept a cease-fire was a surprise.
   Iraq, after a string of battlefield victories, initially called
Iran's move a trick and said it would accept a cease-fire only
after direct talks with Iran.
   But Iraq came under intense diplomatic pressure from many
nations, including the Soviet Union, its major arms supplier, and
the United States, to come to terms quickly and agree to a
cease-fire, said informed diplomatic sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   When the secretary-general agreed to call both envoys to New
York, Iraq agreed to allow the U.N. cease-fire mission to go to
Baghdad.
   ``I am very optimistic now because the confusion and
misunderstandings have been removed,'' said Ismat Kittani, Iraq's
ambassador to the U.N. ``The two foreign ministers will come and
discuss with the secretary-general how to get the peace process
going full-blast at the technical level and political level.''
   Mahallati said the U.N. team will arrive in Tehran on Sunday.
The team then planned to travel to Iraq in its week-long mission
before reporting back to the secretary-general.
   Perez de Cuellar said that after the team returns, he will be
able to put Resolution 598 into motion by setting dates for a
cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and formal peace
talks and establishing an impartial panel to decide which nation
started the war.
   Iran has insisted that Iraq must be branded the aggressor.
Diplomats say Iran needs international condemnation of Iraq to
persuade Iranians to accept a cease-fire.
   But Resolution 598 is vague on a panel that would determine
responsibility for the war, and diplomatic observers said they
expected Iraq to try to undercut that provision.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border
skirmishes.
   The U.N. technical team will include five officers from the U.N.
Truce Supervision Organization based in Jerusalem, two U.N.
observers already in both Tehran and Baghdad and a civilian
political officer.
   Perez de Cuellar said the cease-fire would be monitored by about
250 U.N. observers. But he said funding would be a serious problem
for a new U.N. peacekeeping or observer force.
   ``Now that the U.N. is engaged in a very major operation, there
soon will be a lack of financial stability and, in fact, almost
bankruptcy of the organization,'' he said in a statement. ``This
will impair very seriously these new operations.''
   The United Nations is facing a crisis of unpaid dues, largely
because the United States has not paid $467 million, or about
two-thirds of the total owed to the world organization by its
member states.

<HEAD>Outlook Brighter for Reducing Federal Budget Deficit This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong tax collections from businesses and
individuals are brightening the outlook for reducing the federal
budget deficit in 1988, with red ink for the fiscal year through
June running 2 percent lower than 1987.
   The Treasury Department on Friday reported a rare $9.5 billion
surplus last month, trimming the gap between what the government
has spent and what it has taken in during the first nine months of
the fiscal year to $118 billion, $2.4 billion less than during the
same period last year.
   If the deficit continued building at the same rate, it would
total $147.4 billion when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, down
slightly from the $150.4 billion budget gap of last year and
substantially below the $221.1 billion record high set in 1986.
   ``Right now it looks like the chances are pretty good that we
can beat last year,'' said Mark Lasky, an economist with Data
Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in
Washington, said higher-than-expected collection of individual
income taxes in both May and June are making projections earlier
this year by private economists of about a $160 billion deficit
look pessimistic.
   Quarterly individual tax payments due in June totaled $46.2
billion, up 14.1 percent from the same month in 1987. In May, tax
payments totaled $18 billion, nearly double the collections in May
1987.
   Corporate tax payments also rose, bolstered by strong profits of
U.S. companies. They totaled $18.3 billion in June, 18.6 percent
more than the same month a year ago.
   ``Nobody's really sure, including the Treasury, how this new tax
reform law works. My view is that the law actually is collecting
taxes that were going into tax shelters, which is what it's
supposed to do. In 1989, we'll see even more of this,'' Evans said.
   The major uncertainty remaining for this year, he said, is how
much the government will have to spend to help drought-stricken
farmers. Higher grain prices caused by drought-induced shortages
could lower government price support payments, but special aid to
farmers with shriveled crops could more than make up for that, he
said.
   The Treasury Department said federal spending last month totaled
$89.9 billion, a 7.7 percent increase over June 1987. However,
revenues surged a greater 19.8 percent above last year's level to
$99.3 billion.
   It was only the third surplus posted since the fiscal year began
in October. There was a surplus in January because Social Security
checks for the month were mailed at the end of December and another
in April as individual income tax payments poured in.
   For the first nine months, revenue totaled $681.1 billion, up
6.9 percent from last year, while spending was $799.1 billion, up
5.5 percent.
   The administration is forecasting a deficit of $146.7 billion,
just slightly above the $144 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman
budget balancing law. Next year's target is $136 billion.
   In June, the largest spending category was interest on the
national debt, followed by the military, Social Security, and other
programs in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Military spending totaled $24.6 billion last month and $213.3

the same period in the 1987 fiscal year.
   The other programs in the Department of Health and Human
Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent $13.7 billion in
June and $118.7 billion so far this budget year, a 6 percent
increase over the first three quarters of fiscal 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt totaled $31.6
billion last month and $169.1 billion so far this fiscal year, an
increase of 10.2 percent over the same period last year.

   Elizabeth Taylor says she could do without fame, but
since she's got it she will put it to good use.
   ``My life is outside films ... my life is now working for
AIDS,'' Miss Taylor said at a news conference Friday to promote
Franco Zeffirelli's new film, ``The Young Toscanini.''
   ``I don't really like being famous,'' she said. But in raising
money to combat aquired immune deficiency syndrome, she said, ``I
thought that using my fame could do some good.''
   The film, set in 1880s Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, stars American C.
Thomas Howell as the conductor as a young man and Sophie Ward, an
Englishwoman, as his lover. Miss Taylor, 56, has a supporting role
as an aging soprano, Nadina Bulicioff, inspired to return to
singing by an 18-year-old Arturo Toscanini.
   Zeffirelli directed Miss Taylor and her then-husband Richard
Burton in ``The Taming of the Shrew.''

   Kennedy family members gathered at
the clan's seaside homes here to celebrate the 98th birthday of
matriarch Rose Kennedy.
   The family celebration began Friday with Mass and then moved to
the compound for dinner. The party concluded with white cake with
chocolate frosting, which Mrs. Kennedy's daughter Jean Smith said
is her mother's favorite.
   Mrs. Kennedy's only living son, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
flew to Cape Cod for the occasion as soon as the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta concluded.
   For her grandmother, Kara Kennedy, the senator's daughter,
picked 98 long-stemmed red roses from the Rose Kennedy Garden in
Boston's North End, where Mrs. Kennedy was born.
   Others at the dinner were Mrs. Kennedy's daughter Eunice and
son-in-law Sargent Shriver, daughters Patricia Lawford and Mrs.
Smith, daughter-in-law Ethel Kennedy and an assortment of
grandchildren.
   Mrs. Kennedy suffered a stroke in 1984 and reportedly has been
in poor health recently.

   A trial involving a child custody battle
between actor Peter O'Toole and a New Jersey woman has ended, and
the Superior Court judge who heard the case says he might issue a
decision next week.
   The trial before Judge Alexander Lehrer was closed to reporters
shortly after it began July 13. It ended Thursday.
   Five-year-old Lorcan O'Toole has been caught in a trans-Atlantic
tussle between his father and Karen Somerville O'Toole since the
couple separated in 1983.
   A New Jersey court gave the couple joint custody in an agreement
lasting until September 1989. But both sides argued for a change in
that agreement.
   In May, a judge in London ordered O'Toole to return his son to
Ms. Somerville O'Toole until the courts decide which parent should
get permanent custody.
   Attorneys say O'Toole and Ms. Somerville O'Toole _ who was not
married to the actor but took his name _ claim each violated the
original custody agreement. Under it, each parent was to alternate
custody every month until 1989, when they hoped to reach a
long-term agreement.
   The Irish-born O'Toole, 55, met Ms. Somerville O'Toole, a
37-year-old former model, six years ago.

   Five months after his infamous comments
about black athletes, Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder is planning a
comeback.
   In the Jan. 15 interview that got him fired, Snyder said blacks
were bred to be better athletes, blacks dominate sports and if
blacks become coaches there's not going to be anything left in
athletics for whites.
   ``I didn't say anything derogatory about blacks,'' Snyder told
The Miami Herald in an article published Friday.
   Since CBS-TV fired Snyder from his $750,000-a-year job as a pro
football commentator, he has been living in a Miami Beach hotel,
dieting and lounging on the beach. He's also been hospitalized
twice for heart tests.
   ``I've been laying low, but you've got to come out sooner or
later or retire,'' he said.
   Snyder has scheduled appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Larry
King television talk shows, plans to speak at black universities
and wants to get back on television.

   Andy Griffith graduated from playing first
soldier in ``The Lost Colony'' to the part of Sir Walter Raleigh
during his early theater days, but he remains dubious about how
well he performed as Raleigh.
   ``I don't think I was very good as Raleigh,'' Griffith told the
choir of the outdoor drama during a recent visit, ``but I enjoyed
it.''
   Griffith and his wife, Cindi, were invited to speak to the choir
by Rosalind MacEnulty, the music director and a longtime friend.
Mrs. Griffith has also appeared in the ``The Lost Colony.''
   Griffith, the star of the ``Matlock'' television series, also
starred in ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' which was set in the
fictional town of Mayberry, N.C. He has a home on Roanoke Island,
where Manteo is located, and has spent some time there since the

<HEAD>Justice Finds No Basis to Investigate Former Deputy Attorney
General Burns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has found no basis to
investigate former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns for
promoting a former law partner for a judgeship, sources say.
   The criminal division's public integrity section reached the
conclusion after reviewing information about the relationship
between Burns and Stuart Summit, who has been nominated to the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, according to the
sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Burns and former criminal division chief William Weld plan to
testify before Congress Tuesday about their March 29 protest
resignations.
   They quit out of concern that the continued tenure of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III was hurting Justice Department operations
and morale.
   The Washington Times disclosed Burns' support for Summit last
month, suggesting the former deputy attorney general might have
violated federal conflict-of-interest law.
   The Washington Times this month disclosed that Weld had been the
focus of an internal Justice Department investigation into whether
he smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982. Weld has emphatically
denied the allegation, made in an anonymous letter, and the
department's Office of Professional Responsibility closed the
matter.
   Congressional sources and sources close to the Justice
Department have said the leaking of unfavorable information about
Burns and Weld has been an attempt to discourage them from
testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Burns was still receiving payments from the law firm and had
investments in limited partnerships with Summit at the time he was
urging Summit's nomination last year.
   When asked Friday about the public integrity section's decision,
Summit said he was ``not surprised, there never was anything to
it'' and said he was pleased about the outcome.

<HEAD>Shultz Helps Israel Settle Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has
decided to help Israel hold on to Soviet Jews who might prefer
settling in America, according to U.S. officials.
   He will not oppose a prospective change in Israeli procedures
designed to stem the exodus to the United States of Jews who left
the Soviet Union with exit permits for Israel, the officials said
Friday.
   But Shultz is likely to heed the advice of the bureaus that
handle Soviet and refugee affairs and keep pushing Moscow to permit
wider emigration across the board.
   Most Jews who leave the Soviet Union are permitted to depart if
they can get visas from Israel. Once they reach Vienna, the transit
point for Soviet emigres, nearly 90 percent of them go elsewhere,
mostly to the United States and are taken in by the United States
as refugees.
   Concerned about the situation, the Israeli Cabinet has ordered a
change in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permits would
receive their Israeli visas in Romania and fly to Israel.
   The change in procedure, which has not been put into effect,
would make it harder for Soviet Jews to come to the United States
because they would have to qualify for entry as immigrants. This
could require long waiting periods and most would be fenced out for
various reasons as ineligible.
   The State Department's European bureau, which is involved in
Soviet policy, and the Human Rights Bureau had both recommended to
Shultz that he urge Israel to change its policy and appeal to
Moscow to permit wider emigration.
   Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state for Human
Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, proposed that Soviet Jews remain
eligible for admission to the United States as refugees even after
they reach Israel.
   The State Department's Near Eastern bureau, which deals in Arab
and Israeli affairs, recommended to Shultz that he not contest the
Israeli Cabinet's decision _ advice he will follow, at least
temporarily, according to officials who spoke on the condition they
not be identified.
   ``The debate is less a State Department debate than a debate
about feeling the Israelis would be insulted and that it would
undermine the purpose of the State of Israel if refugees left the
Soviet Union and did not go to Israel,'' an official said. ``They
need and want immigrants.''
   David A. Harris, the Washington representative of the American
Jewish Committee, described the problem as ``one of the hottest and
most complex issues in Israeli-Diaspora debate.'' He referred to
divergent views among Jews living in Israel and elsewhere around
the world.
   ``Ideally,'' Harris said, ``the compromise would be a two-track
policy. Soviet Jews who want to go to Israel would leave the
U.S.S.R. with Israeli visas. Those seeking resettlement in the
United States would leave with American visas. It is our hope the
administration will press the Kremlin in this direction. It's fair,
it's equitable, its logical.''
   Most Soviet citizens are unable to obtain exit permits. But
thousands of Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans over the years have
enjoyed a special privilege of emigrating. Very small numbers of
Jews are permitted to go directly to the United States. The others
can leave only if they obtain visas for Israel.

<HEAD>Forgotten Italian Fashion Designers Fight Back with Frills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian high fashion designers presented the most
ornate collections in many a season for this fall and winter,
perhaps in an effort to give a lift to their own sagging image.
   During the five-day Roman fashion week ending Friday night, the
couture runway brimmed with gold, silver, bronze and precious
stones. Sequined embroidery, no longer flatly stitched, stood out
in three-dimensional flora and fauna, while precious pelts of mink,
sable and fox rimmed cuffs, collars and hemlines.
   The great success achieved by French designer Christian Lacroix,
coupled with a power struggle between Milan and Rome for control of
the Italian fashion scene, has weakened the image of the
made-in-Italy couture label, which in the 1960s presented a real
threat to the supremacy of French couture.
   Today, only a handful of buyers and press representatives come
to Rome for the twice-a-year showings, mainly to check in at
Valentino and Gianfranco Ferre, the popular Milanese ready-to-wear
designer that began its high fashion collections two years ago.
   Rome tries to put its best foot forward by using elegant hotels
and historic outdoor settings for its shows. They contrast sharply
with Milan trade fairgrounds, where the Italian ready-to-wear shows
are held, and Parisian tents, where French collections are
displayed.
   Although individual houses such as Lancetti, Mila Schoen,
Galitzine and Andre Laug have a long list of faithful clients, the
Valentino couture label is the only one that can still give the
French a run for their money.
   The look for the fall-winter Italian style is vaguely Russian,
with sable playing heavily for day and night on hats, coats,
jackets, sweaters and evening gowns. Redingote coat styles abound,
as well as wide lapels on jackets and high collars on dresses and
blouses alike.
   Shades tend toward fall greens, purples and browns. Flannel gray
makes a big comeback, and the newest shade of the season is ruby
red, championed by Gianfranco Ferre in his much applauded
collection.
   In a situation emblematic of their unsettled state, the
designers could not agree on one hemline, with some diving way
below the knee, while others still offered short skirts. However,
the tiny miniskirt is out, and the preferred length is right on the
knee.
   Although not prominent, pants dot the collections, with Ferre
offering the newest idea: gray flannel man-tailored trousers by
night worn with a sumptuous sequined top.
   Heels are very high, makeup is pronounced with bright red lips,
and hairstyles are neat, often pinned back at the neck.
   For evening wear, the designers let themselves go, often
tailoring their gowns from shimmering gold, silver or bronze
fabrics and decorating an otherwise simple sheath with heavy
jeweled sequins or entire life-sized floral arrangements of fabric
and sequins.
   And if that's not enough, fur trimming is sometimes added for
extra winter warmth.
   With prices for a couture gown starting at $10,OOO and soaring
over $100,000 for more elaborate models, it is understandable that
the designers are eager to give the client her money's worth.
However, the look can and often does fall into fashion kitsch.
   Only Valentino and Ferre were able to carry this opulence off
gracefully.
   Ferre unburdened his floral-sequined and fur-trimmed silver gray
ballgown by interspersing its layers of velvet and taffeta with
yards and yards of airy tulle.
   Valentino streamlined the look by relegating ornate sequins to
cummerbunds on a simple chiffon gown and fashioning his floral
creations out of bands of satin.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Investigation To Continue Into Next Presidential Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Extension of the life of the Iran-Contra grand jury
will push the 18-month-old investigation into the start of the next
president's term with more charges possible.
   U.S. District Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson acted Friday, just
six days before the jury was to be disbanded, to extend its work
for six more months, through Jan. 27, 1989. By then, President
Reagan's successor will be in office.
   Robinson, in his order, responded to a sealed motion from
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to extend the inquiry, even
as Walsh's staff prepares for the scheduled Sept. 20 opening of the
trial of former White House aide Oliver North. Lawyers for North
have asked that the trial be postponed until March 1989.
   Walsh is expected to continue looking into the activities of
U.S. officials and others in Central America following the
indictment last month of a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica,
Joseph Fernandez.
   An unspecified number of co-conspirators were cited along with
Fernandez in an illegal supply network aimed at getting funds to
the Contras in 1986, when Congress had banned U.S. aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Robinson's order said the purpose of the extension was ``for the
investigations identified by the government in its motion.''
   Jim Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said he could not comment on
specifics of the planned investigations mentioned in the judge's
order.
   Walsh's investigation previously focused on U.S. fund-raising
efforts for the Contras, arms sales to Iran and the diversion of
profits from the sales to the rebels.
   This led to charges against North, former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and
Albert Hakim for their roles in the Iranian arms sales and the
diversion of profits from the sales to private use and to the
Contras.
   Two fund-raisers and former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane earlier pleaded guilty to other charges resulting from
Walsh's grand jury investigation.
   The charges against Fernandez accused him of helping North and
Secord coordinate air drops of weapons and supplies to Contra
groups in 1986.
   Trials of Poindexter, Secord and Hakim will follow that of North.
   On Tuesday, North, Poindexter and Hakim petitioned the U.S.
Court of Appeals to have their indictments dismissed because they
believe testimony given to Congress under grants of immunity would
be used against them in the trials.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen business and professional
organizations urged Jamaica's governing and main opposition parties
to end political violence between their supporters.
   The call to sign a peace agreement came after backers of the
opposition People's National Party stoned a busload of Jamaica
Labor Party supporters in a fishing village Sunday. Pro-government
militants then burned several shacks and chased one opposition
party member into the Caribbean, where he drowned.
   ``In a climate of violence and lawlessness, the entire nation
suffers from a drying up of investment and a decline in tourism and
other economic activity,'' read a joint statement issued Friday by
the 18 private sector groups.
   Several others were injured in separate attacks during the week
between rival bands of the two parties.
   More than 700 people died in political violence during the 1980
general elections.
   ``The signing of a joint declaration by the leaders and the
public commitment of their parties to law and order can no longer
be delayed for whatever reason,'' read the statement, which asked
that the agreement be signed by Aug. 1, Independence Day.
   Elections are expected in December, but Jamaica's Constitution
grants the prime minister a three-month grace period before calling
new elections.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga was elected for a five-year term in
1983.
   ``We believe we speak for the law-abiding majority of this
country in saying we are sick of....the violence and partisan
point-scoring and are disappointed by our political leaders' delay
in fulfilling their national duty,'' the statement read.
   Michael Manley, a former prime minister and the opposition
leader, said Wednesday his party is ready to sign the agreement.
   ``Jamaica is demanding that both political parties work together
to bring the madness of political violence to an end,'' he said.
   Bruce Golding, chairman of the governing party, said the parties
must have the political will to end the violence before signing a
peace pact.
   Groups signing the statement included the Jamaica Hotel and
Tourist Association, the Medical Association, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Employers Federation and the
Exporters Association of Jamaica.

<HEAD>Sugar Quota Will Benefit 39 Countries, Brings Praise From U.S.
Sugar Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ A 40 percent increase in the U.S. sugar quota will
benefit the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Brazil and 36
other countries and is bringing praise from large U.S. sugar users.
   The increase in what had been the lowest sugar quotas in 113
years authorizes the purchase of 300,000 additional short tons of
sugar in 1988 and also reallocates the 20,300 tons of sugar that
would have been bought from Panama before all trade with that
country was cut off.
   The Agriculture Department and the office of the U.S. Trade
Representative announced the sugar quota expansion to 1,056,675
tons at the end of the trading day Friday.
   The new quota is about 56,000 tons higher than the 1987 figure
but lower than the 1986 quota of 1.7 million tons. The 1988 quota
previously had been the lowest since 1875, agriculture and trade
officials said.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who has advocated a
scrapping of the program that keeps U.S. sugar prices higher than
those on the world market, said the increase was necessary because
of unexpected cuts in U.S. production, ``including the likely
effects of the drought on sugar beet yields.''
   The low sugar quotas announced last December had brought
criticism from U.S. sugar users who anticipated difficulty getting
enough sugar and disappointment in countries whose quotas were cut
_ particularly the Philippines, which has long been dependent upon
the U.S. sugar quotas to help its ailing economy.
   The U.S. sugar program offers a kind of dual subsidy, helping
the producing countries by paying well above world market prices
for their sugar and helping U.S. sugar growers by guaranteeing them
the higher prices, too. The United States buys sugar under the
quota system at the same price it pays U.S. producers, about 23
cents a pound, up from 18 cents earlier this year. The current
world market price is approaching 15 cents a pound after dipping to
around 6 cents.
   Under the new quotas, the Dominican Republic will be able to
sell 176,710 short tons, up from 123,200; the Philippines 158,640,
up from 110,600; and Brazil 145,590, up from 101,500. Those three
countries account for almost half of the foreign sugar sold to the
United States.
   Last December when the Agriculture Department set the low
quotas, officials said the cuts were justified because of decreased
consumption with Americans using more artificial and other natural
sweeteners.
   The program is designed to guarantee U.S. producers a high price
for their sugar and is also favored by producers of artificial
sweeteners because they also can charge higher prices.
   Critics include manufacturers who use a lot of sugar in their
products, because it keeps sugar prices high.
   But sugar users were pleased with the new quotas.
   ``We applaud the secretary of agriculture,'' said Tom Hammer of
the Sweetener Users Association, which represents companies that
use sugar.
   ``It will stop the inflationary spiral that was going on with
domestic sugar prices,'' he said. Hammer said the need was
``immediate and urgent because my members ... believe that without
it, adequate supplies of sugar by late summer and fall were very
much in doubt.''
   Except for the elimination of Panama's quota, the share of sugar
purchases allocated to each country will not change.
   Lyng said the new quota includes a base import quota of 975,000
tons and 2,000 tons of specialty sugar.
   The new allocations raised the minimum quota from 5,770 tons to
8,000.
   It was the first mid-year increase in the sugar quota since
April 5, 1984, when there was a shortfall in U.S. sugar cane
production.

<HEAD>Chinese Publishers Fired for Printing Irving Wallace Novel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two publishers were fired for printing a novel by
popular American novelist Irving Wallace that local censors judged
obscene, an official report said today.
   The Xinhua News Agency said the government of the northeastern
province had dismissed the two for printing 400,000
Chinese-language copies of the 1975 Wallace novel, ``The Fan Club.''
   It identified the pair as Sun Yuanzhong, deputy director and
deputy editor-in-chief of the Yanbian People's Publishing House,
and Cui Xingshou, head of the literature and art editorial
department. They were dismissed by authorities in the Yanbian
Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin province.
   In addition, they were ordered, along with another editor, to
write self-criticisms.
   China has no national obscenity laws. The prevailing political
climate often determines whether a work of art dealing with sex or
other sensitive subjects will be acceptable.
   The government has said it is drafting laws and regulations
defining the limits of artistic expression and outlining standards
for the censorship of movies.
   Englishman D.H. Lawrence's novel ``Lady Chatterley's Lover,''
long banned as pornography, has been hailed this year as a
masterpiece. Paintings of nudes, pulled down from shows a year ago,
are appearing in national galleries.

<HEAD>Aurora Minister And Civil Rights Leader Found Beaten To Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AURORA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister active in the civil rights
movement was found beaten to death Friday in his church hours after
he returned from the Democratic convention, and police charged a
nearby resident with murder.
   The Rev. Robert Wesby, 61, who headed the branch of Operation
PUSH in this Chicago suburb, was killed with a ``large, sharp
instrument,'' Kane County Coroner Mary Lou Kearns said.
   Associates described Wesby as a longtime friend or colleague of
Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson, founder of
Chicago-based Operation PUSH. Wesby was not listed as a Jackson
delegate, but had apparently gone to the convention to support
Jackson.
   Wesby's body was found shortly before 10 a.m., about two hours
after he returned from Atlanta, said Becky Jones, who was answering
telephones at his Progressive Baptist Church, about 35 miles west
of Chicago. Wesby founded the church 25 years ago.
   Late Friday night, police acting on a tip arrested Calvin Green,
28, at his home about two blocks from the church and charged him
with murder, said police Capt. Lou Beatus. He said police were
still trying to determine a motive for the slaying. The suspect is
black, as was the victim.
   Green was scheduled for a bond hearing Saturday, Beatus said.
   Kearns said Wesby died immediately after being attacked. No
weapon was found.
   Police found the body near the altar of the church after
responding to a call that Wesby had been beaten, said police Lt.
Don McDonald.
   Later Friday, Wesby's friends and supporters, including Aurora
Mayor David Pierce, gathered outside the church to grieve.
   ``You couldn't find anyone better than that man. Any time, night
or day, Rev. Wesby would come and give anyone any help they
needed,'' said Odell Smith, a longtime friend.
   A Chicago native, Wesby was the recipient of Aurora's first
Community Leadership Award in November 1985.

<HEAD>Drought Sends Parched Insect Armies Marching Into Bay Area Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hordes of thirsty ants driven by drought
and heat are invading homes throughout the San Francisco Bay area
in search of water, and residents say no one seems to know how to
stop them.
   ``I've never seen anything like it. There are millions of
them,'' said Anita Lowery of Novato. ``I've almost cried.''
   The ants are climbing out of light switches, creeping into baby
bottles and even making their way into freezers.
   ``They are getting into bed with people. When you turn on the
water, they come out of the faucet in globs. People finding
themselves taking baths with ants,'' said Dick Wolbert of Jackson
Pest Control in Novato.
   Experts say the tiny insects are only looking for water for
their bone-dry nests, but unsympathetic human hosts are calling
exterminators.
   ``It is really, really bad this year, and it's creating
hysteria,'' said Kevin Pendergraft of California Exterminators in
Walnut Creek.
   More than 150 calls have come in each day since last weekend,
when temperatures soared to record highs, he said.
   ``The county is going under with all the ants,'' Wolbert said.
``People have called in who haven't had ants for 20 years. They
have them all over the house.''
   Even ant fans wish the ants would march somewhere else.
   As a scientist, Benny Fouche admires ants as ``survivalists,''
but as a homeowner, he's being driven crazy by the insects'
persistence.
   Fouche, a research associate in urban entomology at the
University of California at Berkeley, looks for nests in the yard
of his El Cerrito home but admits he's probably wasting his time.
   ``Unless you get the queen, I can almost guarantee that the ants
will out-persevere you. They'll just keep coming,'' he said. ``The
colony needs food and water. They have thousands of workers who
will sacrifice themselves.''
   If they weren't so good at surviving, they wouldn't have defied
``all the pest control people in the bay area,'' Fouche said.
   Wolbert called the situation ``just another result of nature
changing'' and said a similar problem occurred during the 1977
drought.
   ``They just have to set up a happy home. They need water and a
little food,'' he said. ``If you have food in your pantry or water
in your sinks, you're going to have them.''
   Wolbert said he couldn't understand all the uproar: ``It's
really phenomenal. Ants are very clean. They're always preening
each other.''
   Susan Grippi of Novato didn't share his complacency.
   ``It feels like it's been a disaster,'' she said, adding that
ants had surrounded her home and invaded an upstairs bathroom.
``They make me crazy.''

<HEAD>Bail Denied for Libyan Accused of Illegal Intelligence Gathering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Libyan man accused of gathering
information about American intelligence operatives and arranging
for the military training of American dissidents in Libya has been
ordered held without bail.
   A U.S. magistrate on Friday granted bail to five other
defendants, including Mousa Hawamda, a travel agency owner accused
of involvement in an alleged Libyan plot to assassinate a ``high
government official in the United States.'' Sources have said the
official was former White House aide Oliver North, who played a key
role in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya.
   The prosecution immediately appealed the bail for Hawamda, a
naturalized American described by the FBI as a senior Libyan
intelligence operative, and he was ordered held pending an appeals
hearing early next week.
   The New York Times, in today's editions, quoted Justice
Department officials as saying there is little evidence to support
a federal prosecutor's assertion that Hawamda may have helped in
the alleged plot.
   The Times said Justice officials who asked not to be identified
said they were baffled when U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson asserted
in open court earlier this week that Hawamda should be held without
bail because he was a Libyan intelligence officer who may have
assisted in a plot to kill a government official.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that while
there may have been an assassination plot aimed at North, the only
information linking Hawamda to such a conspiracy came from an
informer whose reliabiity is uncertain.
   Hudson had no comment on the assertions that there was little
evidence to support allegations about the assassination plot, the
Times said.
   F. Andrew Carroll, the lawyer representing Hawamda, called the
prosecution's contention of a plot to kill a high government
official ``ludicrous.''
   Hawamda and the five others were among eight men arrested
Wednesday on suspicion of a scheme to illegally use Libyan
government funds to solicit support for Libya among American
dissidents, including Indians and Black Muslims.
   Friday's hearing before magistrate Leonie Brinkema was to
determine whether the six would be freed on bond.
   The bail ranged from $250,000 for Hawamda to $10,000 for Manhal
Ben Mohamed, a Moroccan who worked for Hawamda.
   Two other defendants are being held in Denver, Colo. and
Detroit, Mich.
   Alvin M. Binder, a criminal lawyer from Mississippi who
represented four of the defendants in court, said the case was
``very political.'' Binder, a criminal lawyer who represented
Atlanta child murderer Wayne Williams in 1982, said the prosecution
had made ``allegations with no concrete evidence.''
   Hudson told reporters after the detention hearing that ``the
case involves issues far beyond just a diversion of funds.'' But he
refused to elaborate, saying additional charges would be made when
indictments are returned, possibly late next week.
   Speaking for the prosecution, FBI special agent Donald J.
Bartnik said the defendant held without bail, Saleh Al-Rajhi, was a
Libyan intelligence operative who in June 1987 was ordered to
gather the names and addresses of U.S. intelligence officials
dealing with the Mediterranean region.
   The FBI seized a document handwritten by Al-Rajhi as a cover
letter for a computer list of intelligence operatives, Bartnik
said. The list and letter were sent to the head of Libyan
intelligence, Mohamed Madjoub, he added.
   Al-Rajhi also wrote Madjoub a memo which indicated the Libyans
had promised to fund American dissident groups in the United States
and pay for their military training in Libya, Bartnik said.

   Eastern Airlines' announcement that it would lay
off 4,000 employees and eliminate service to 14 cities to cut costs
was met with bitterness and fear by workers, who should learn their
fate by Monday.
   ``I've heard rumors this way since I've been working here,''
said Evelyn Perez, a ticket agent at Kansas City International
Airport who has been with Eastern for 11 years. ``It's always been
felt, but now it's real.''
   The plan announced Friday by the loss-plagued airline would trim
12 percent of the work force and eliminate service to the 14 cities
on Aug. 31.
   Included among the layoffs or early retirements will be 520 jobs
in Miami, 300 in Atlanta and 350 in Kansas City, Mo., which will no
longer be the carrier's Western hub, Eastern President Phil Bakes
said.
   The reductions also will include 1,100 jobs from the New York
City area, including 600 at a reservations center in Woodbridge,
N.J., and 500 flight attendants, pilots and managers based at
Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports.
   Last November, Eastern eliminated 3,500 jobs, mostly from the
company's union ranks.
   ``We are preserving the airline. We're strengthening the
airline. I don't care to place the blame anywhere,'' Bakes said,
citing high operating costs and increased competition for Eastern's
huge losses.
   But John J. Bavis, chairman of the 3,500-member Air Line Pilots
Association contingent at Eastern, disagreed.
   ``They've done nothing over the past two years except squeeze
the assets out of Eastern in order to help subsidize our sister
airline, Continental,'' he said.
   Both Eastern and Continental are subsidiaries of Houston-based
Texas Air Corp., which lost $466 million last year.
   The announcement came in the seventh month of bitter contract
talks between Eastern and the Machinists union, which is seeking
raises for 10,000 Eastern workers. The carrier is seeking $161
million in pay cuts and other concessions.
   The Miami-based airline also is seeking $69 million in
concessions from its pilots union, which began formal contract
talks with the company Friday.
   ``Last year, we lost $182 million. In essence, Eastern is
returning to its basic roots in an attempt to regain strength in
the marketplace,'' Bakes said.
   Eastern's operations in Boston, New York, Washington, Atlanta
and Miami will be the core of the carrier's service, he said.
   The 14 cities being cut are Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort de France,
Martinique; Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn.;
Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla; Omaha, Neb.; Dallas and San Antonio,
Texas; Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; San Diego; St. Lucia, West
Indies; and Tucson, Ariz.
   The personnel cuts will involve both union and non-union members
and management personnel, Bakes said. The reductions will reduce
the work force to 29,500, down from 43,300 in September 1986.
   The airline said the work force reduction would allow it to sell
a proportional share of its fleet, cutting the number of planes it
operates from 246 to 202 in the fall.
   Machinists local chief Charles Bryan was en route to Miami from
Atlanta, and could not be reached Friday. Earlier this week, after
word of the impending cuts leaked, he said Eastern would have ``no
credibility'' and said Texas Air President Frank Lorenzo was
``evil.''
   The Machinists union is seeking a two-year contract with raises
of 1.5 percent and 5 percent, which Eastern says will cost $50
million yearly.
   Employees were shocked by the news of the layoffs, said a
reservation operator in Woodbridge, N.J.
   ``A lot of us have 10 or 15 years seniority and now we're going
to be looking for other jobs,'' said the woman, who would only
identify herself as Josephine. ``There's a lot of crying going on.''

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's government-controlled radio
said hundreds of pilgrims Friday protested the deaths last year of
402 people and that police attacked some of the protesters.
   Saudi Arabia on Saturday denied the report as ``lies and
fabrications,'' and area residents contacted by The Associated
Press said they had heard no reports of violence.
   Parts of the report by Tehran radio, monitored in London, were
indistinct, but monitors said they did not hear any reference to
injuries.
   Saudi Arabia said more than 1 million pilgrims from around the
world gathered Friday in 111-degree temperatures for Sabbath
prayers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which houses Islam's holiest
shrine.
   The pilgrims, who came from more than 130 countries, have
converged on Mecca for the annual hajj rituals, one of the five
sacraments that any able Moslem is required to perform once a
lifetime.
   Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official
source as saying the Iranian report, along with a similar Iranian
report on Wednesday, was ``made up.''
   The source said it was one of a series of ``lies and
fabrications'' broadcast by Iran to create tension. He said
pilgrims in Mecca were undertaking their rites ``in calm and secure
conditions.''
   Residents in the Mecca area reached by telephone from Bahrain
said they were not aware of any violence. They said pilgrims prayed
early Saturday in preparation for the culmination of the pilgrimage.
   Other residents reached in Jiddah also said they had heard no
reports of violence.
   ``Hundreds of Arab, Turk, Afghan, Pakistani and American
pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca today (Friday), chanting slogans ...
and carrying placards condemning the Al-Saud regime in their
killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in
Mecca,'' Tehran radio said.
   It added: ``According to received reports, the Saudi regime's
police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and
surrounded them. In some sections, they attacked the ranks of the
marchers.''
   During last year's pilgrimage to Mecca, 25 miles east of Jiddah,
402 people were killed in riots. Saudi Arabia said the pilgrims,
275 of them Iranians, died in a stampede. Iran claimed Saudi police
shot them.
   The Saudis accused the Iranians of holding demonstrations,
including anti-U.S. protests, in defiance of a ban on political
activity. Last April, Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations
with Tehran, citing terrorism and subversion.
   Saudi Arabia has been receiving the pilgrims and organizing the
hajj this year with extensive security measures to prevent a
recurrence of last year's violence.
   The official Saudi Press Agency said thousands of worshipers
gathered inside the Grand Mosque Friday, in its expansive courtyard
or on its roof. The roof alone has a capacity of 80,000 people, the
agency said.
   After the Friday prayers at the mosque, which harbors the Kaaba
_ Islam's most sacred shrine _ the worshipers moved three miles
away to Mina.
   Pilgrims spend the rest of the day in Mina praying in
preparation for the culmination of hajj on Saturday.
   The agency reported the temperature in Mecca, 25 miles east of
Jiddah, was 111 degrees. Jiddah is the kingdom's capital.
   Saturday, the ninth day of the month of Zhul-Hijja by Islamic
calendar, is earmarked as ``Wukuf,'' or the day of standing, when
pilgrims wake at dawn and travel another six miles to Arafat, where
they remain praying, chanting and listening to sermons.
   Saturday night is spent at Muzdalifa, about four miles away,
where pebbles are thrown in a ritual stoning of the devil. At dawn
Sunday, sheep are slaughtered in sacrifice and the hajj ends for
the hundreds of thousands who have come by air, sea and land. A
four-day Eid al-Adha or Feast of Sacrifice, then follows throughout
the Moslem world.
   It is the biggest religious congregation on Earth, and reports
from Mecca said traffic was moving smoothly but slowly Friday.
   Thousands of vehicles, mainly buses, coasters and jeeps were
used to transport the pilgrims, although thousands preferred to
move on foot, according to the reports.
   The director general of passports administration, Gen. Fahd bin
Mohammed Al-Sherif, told the Saudi news agency that 762,755
pilgrims arrived from abroad as of Monday.
   The foreigners, who included Moslem heads of state, premiers and
ministers, joined about half a million more from within Saudi
Arabia. These include worshipers and thousands who come to provide
services, including about 20,000 security men, according to
diplomatic sources.
   The Iranians boycotted this year's pilgrimage when Saudi Arabia
sought to reduce the numbers f pilgrims, citing massive renovations
at Mecca and neighboring Medina, which harbors the tomb of the
prophet Mohammed. Pilgrims visit Medina after the hajj formally
ends.
   Iranians have urged other Moslems to take control of Mecca from
the Saudi rulers, who are its custodians. Iranian television
reported demonstrations took place but Saudi authorities denied
that.

   Weddings and soccer games still stir
Iraqis' Arab zeal for celebration, and a religious holiday can be a
time of great feasting.
   But Iraqis are showing an uncharacteristic lack of jubilation
over Iran's agreement to halt its 8-year-old war with Iraq. For
people like Suad Mousa, the war will end only when her family is
reunited.
   ``I really want the guns to fall silent and for my dear husband
to come home,'' said the 34-year-old mother of three, whose husband
has been in the army since the war began.
   ``When the Iranians said they would accept the U.N. (cease-fire)
resolution, I really thought the war was finally over, but it seems
now it will take weeks and probably months before he will be
back,'' she said.
   Such war-weary wariness has been common in Iraq after Iran
agreed Monday to accept a truce.
   ``There was nothing. No reaction,'' said a European diplomat who
was in Baghdad on Monday.
   Iraqis seem deeply suspicious of the Iranian decision, and the
government is insisting any truce be tied to a final settlement.
   Parades, celebrations and television specials typically greet
Iraqi victories in battle. None followed the Iranian announcement.
   Official news media and President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath
Party have encouraged caution and continued vigilance by the
military.
   The army has continued to fight, and it said Thursday night it
had recaptured 33 northern hills lost to Iran in the early days of
the war.
   Iran said Iraqi units penetrated 12 miles into its territory
Friday and claimed Iraq used chemical weapons.
   Exultation is common here over much less than the end of a long
and costly war. Fusillades of tracer bullets lit the night sky over
Baghdad when Iraq defeated rival Syria in the Arab soccer
championship Thursday night.
   Wedding parties toot car horns and bang drums as they move
through the streets of Baghdad.
   Families are buying sheep to slaughter for the Eid al-Adha feast
that marks the end of Islam's season of pilgrimage to Mecca. The
date depends on the moon, but it is expected Sunday or Monday.
   Celebration of the war's end, however, apparently will have to
wait for a final peace.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say distrust of the Iranians, who accepted
a Security Council resolution they had rejected since its passage a
year ago, is rooted in hundreds of years of conflict between Arab
Iraq and Persian Iran.
   Government officials also feel Iran may want a truce only as a
respite in which to rebuild their army, which has lost several
battles this year.
   Some cite Iranian statements that a cease-fire does not mean the
end of the war, which Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini sees as a crusade for his own vision of Islam.
   Iraq rejected proposals of a cease-fire two years ago when its
own forces were being battered near the southern city of Basra and
many observers felt collapse was near.
   It would ``certainly not'' accept a truce without real peace now
that it has the upper hand militarily, said a Western diplomat who
recently talked with Iraqi officials. He said Iraq insists on
direct peace talks with Iran as a sign ``of serious purpose.''
   A European diplomat said Iraqis are ``still going to be nervous
about the Iranians because the Iranians haven't been beaten'' and
still are ruled by crusading clerics. He said Iran ``could be
militarily quite potent ... within a year or two.''
   Although they are not celebrating, ordinary Iraqis are anxious
for the war to end.
   ``I am an old man,'' said 68-year-old Mahmoud Shaker at the
counter of his auto parts store. ``I have been running the shop for
four years, since my elder son was conscripted. I am very tired and
I want him back to the shop and with the family.''

<HEAD>Business Pleased With Atlanta's Image During Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's over, and Atlanta is happy.
   City and business officials praised their city and the publicity
it received during the four-day Democratic National Convention,
which ended Thursday.
   ``The awareness of Atlanta and Georgia is at an all-time high
throughout the world, and that will translate into investment
decisions in future months,'' George Berry, commissioner of the
state Department of Industry and Trade, said Friday.
   Berry said Gov. Joe Frank Harris plans a business-hunting trip
to Australia this fall, ``and we will not have to explain to
anybody we meet with where Atlanta is, and that's the big benefit
of the convention as far as we were concerned.''
   Many Americans are ``still in the mindset (that Atlanta is)
`Gone With the Wind,''' said Denise S. Dwozan, spokeswoman for the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, referring to the novel and
film about the South during the Civil War.
   But, she said, ``I think they now have an excellent picture of
Atlanta in 1988 _ a progressive, exciting city.''
   Mayor Andrew Young, also pleased with the city in its role as
host, plugged Atlanta as a site for future major events.
   ``I would hope that we have received the kind of good coverage
around the world that will convince the Olympic Committee that we
really know how to put on a party,'' Young said Friday. The city is
the U.S. nominee to be host of the 1996 Summer Games.
   Live broadcasts during the convention by network morning
television shows, which originated in Atlanta, were particularly
helpful in dispelling myths, Ms. Dwozan said.
   Those programs showed ``Atlanta is a metropolitan city, with a
fabulous skyline, a lot of Fortune 500 companies,'' she said, and
people already have begun calling, wanting more information. The
callers say, ``Gosh, I never had any idea y'all had all that down
there, so can you send me a packet?''
   Pre-convention studies estimated the convention would bring
between $58.7 million and $64.3 million into the city, which spent
$15 million to stage it.
   Berry and Ms. Dwozan estimated that the direct economic impact
was about what had been predicted, but they stressed the short-term
gain was not their goal.
   The city already is a major convention town, Ms. Dwozan said, so
the hope is that tourism will increase and businesses will look
closer at moving to Atlanta or Georgia because of interest
generated by the convention.
   Ms. Dwozan said convention bureau President Ted Sprague
estimates the city received about $1 billion worth of ``media
awareness'' worldwide. ``We could never have afforded an
advertising campaign like that.''
   ``For the most part,'' she said, ``Atlanta was accurately
portrayed. Some of the stories that were negative were accurate.
   ``Atlanta is not perfect. We do have things that need improving
and some of the stories touched on that. All in all, we're
thrilled.''
   The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce had set as a particular goal
keeping the 15,000 reporters in town informed about the city and
trying to make it easy for them to work, hoping the city would look
good.
   ``In that, we overwhelmingly achieved that objective,'' said
chamber spokesman Barry King. ``It was great, it was fantastic
exposure: a little bit of the good, a little bit of the not-so-good.
   ``Nobody really zinged us badly,'' King said. ``The city
performed fantastically. Hospitality was truly gracious in all
respects. Police and security people were outstanding. They looked
good. The demonstrators got their point across.
   ``We couldn't have bought this kind of exposure,'' he said.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen launched their general
election campaign Friday with a trip to Bentsen's home turf and a
promise that ``We're going to make every American a shareholder in
the American dream.''
   About 1,000 supporters endured blazing heat to greet the
Democratic ticket on an airport tarmac here, adjacent to Bentsen's
hometown of Mission. ``I don't want to kid you,'' Dukakis said.
``This is going to be a tough race.''
   A Mexican band played, and both Dukakis and Bentsen, perspiring
in the July heat, addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish.
Dukakis' command of Spanish helped him win Texas in the Super
Tuesday primary.
   ``You know how important Texas is going to be to us. And we need
your help,'' Dukakis told residents of the state also claimed as
home by the certain Republican nominee, George Bush. ``I know what
you did on Super Tuesday for Michael Dukakis. You can do it again.''
   Bentsen said ``What we have seen on the part of Michael Dukakis
is a reaching out, a bringing in,'' of all segments of society.
   The pair met briefly with reporters. Asked about Bush campaign
manager Lee Atwater's characterization of his acceptance speech as
negative and non-specific, Dukakis replied ``Well, he's an expert
on both subjects.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen then headed to Houston for another rally,
after which they traveled to California for the night.
   Dukakis was greeted at the Stockton, Calif., airport by a large
crowd, some of whom said they had waited as long as two hours to
catch a glimpse of he Democratic nominee.
   In Houston, Dukakis stood with Bentsen, their arms upraised, at
a rally surrounded by the city's skyscrapers before a crowd of
about 3,000 people.
   ``The Republicans are confused,'' Dukakis said. ``They don't
know what to make of this ticket. And they're worried, let me tell
you. Because they know we're not going to concede one single state
of the 50 to the Republican Party this fall.''
   Bentsen was to accompany Dukakis throughout a five-state,
coast-to-coast swing through the weekend.
   Aboard their plane were several members of the Texas
congressional delegation and Ann Richards, the state treasurer who
delivered the Democratic keynote address in Atlanta last Monday
night.
   Enroute to McAllen, Dukakis noted that the community is in the
Rio Grande Valley, an area suffering unemployment of ``25, 30, 35
percent.''
   ``We're going to make every American a shareholder in the
American dream _ that's what this campaign is all about,'' he said.
   Earlier, former Democratic rival Jesse Jackson gave Dukakis and
Bentsen an enthusiastic sendoff from Atlanta before a crowd of
Jackson's convention delegates. Jackson called on his supporters to
provide the ticket with the same ``street heat'' that led to civil
rights gains in the 1960s. He said they needed to find millions of
new voters for the November election.
   ``We've got to keep on that street heat ... enough heat for
George Bush to get out of the kitchen,'' Jackson said.
   ``The stakes are very high,'' Dukakis said before leaving
Atlanta, where he accepted the Democratic nomination Thursday
night. ``We can't take another four years of what we've been going
through for the last eight.''
   The campaign stakes in Texas are the third highest in the
country. It trails only California and New York in electoral votes
with 29 and Dukakis is counting on Bentsen to put those in the
Democratic column.
   The senior senator's personal popularity in the Lone Star State
is solid and his fund-raising ability unparalleled. He first won
the Senate in 1970 by defeating then-Congressman Bush, and has been
re-elected twice since, netting 60 percent of the vote in 1982, and
he's staying on the ballot again this year.
   Modesto, Calif., was the next stop after the Texas visit, where
the ticket will be eyeing California's top prize of 41 electoral
votes. The swing back East will take them through Minot, N.D., and
St. Louis, Mo., and then a rally in Pennsylvania, fourth with 25
votes in the electoral college.
   Dukakis' aides said the trip was designed to demonstrate their
intent to battle in every state, conceding none to the Republicans.
   Jackson and his audience gave a polite reception to Bentsen, the
more conservative half of the ticket. Jackson acknowledged that
Bentsen might be what the Democatic party ticket needed now.
   ``He represents a wing. We represent a wing,'' he said. ``It
takes two wings to fly.''
   Jackson compared Bentsen with Lyndon Johnson, who was viewed
with skepticism by blacks but who ``rose to the occasion'' and
became a force behind the civil rights legislation when he became
president. But Jackson also needled Bentsen, implying that people
should vote for him for president to get him out of the Senate.
``In practical terms ... it means the Contras have lost a vote.''
   Bentsen applauded Jackson's remarks and recited for the group
his own record on civil rights. He asked for their support, saying
``indifference is not an option in 1988,'' and at the end received
a standing ovation.

<HEAD>Moscow Proposing Plan To Verify Curbs On Cruise Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has developed a plan that
would give each nation unprecedented access to each other's bomber
bases, strategic naval ports and military ships as a way of
verifying constraints on cruise missiles, according to a report
published today.
   The Washington Post, quoting Soviet officials, reported the
proposal calls for permanently stationing teams of U.S. and Soviet
inspectors outside factories where cruise missiles are produced,
where their warheads are installed and where the weapons are loaded
onto submarines and other ships.
   It also calls for periodic inspection of military bases where
long-range aircraft are equipped with cruise missiles, and
short-notice inspections of unrelated sites where cruise missiles
are strongly suspected of being illegally stored.
   The Post said the Kremlin plan was outlined in interviews with
Viktor Karpov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's disarmament chief, and
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, senior arms control adviser on the
Soviet general staff.
   According to Karpov and Chervov, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev still wants to sign an agreement with President Reagan
sharply cutting strategic offensive nuclear arms and incorporating
these inspection rights to verify each side's compliance.
   But the Soviet officials said the Reagan administration thus far
has blocked the plan because of Navy and Air Force resistance to
proposed Soviet inspections. They called on Reagan to ``make a
political decision'' in the next six weeks to overrule the military
or see his hopes for agreement dashed.
   ``This is a two-way process,'' the Post quoted Chervov as
saying. ``We are not happy about U.S. (inspection) personnel on our
submarines. But if we are serious (about controlling arms), then we
should agree on inspections of anything.''

<HEAD>Anglicans Debate Ordination Of Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five men and a woman dueled politely
over the divisive issue of women priests at the world conference of
525 Anglican bishops.
   Three came out against women priests or urged caution and two
were in favor, with Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie holding
an advisory role at panel discussions on Friday.
   Runcie is leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, whose
leaders are tackling the question at the Lambeth Conference, held
every 10 years. The 525 bishops attending are from 164 countries.
   Runcie recalled that the 1978 conference agreed that the
decisions of any of the 27 self-governing churches should be
respected by the others, whether they agreed or not.
   But since then, he said, ``matters are not what they were.'' He
referred to the ordination of more than 1,200 women priests and
more than 1,400 women deacons, priestly assistants who can conduct
baptisms, marriages and funerals but not Holy Communion.
   Runcie says the Anglican Communion could break up if a woman
bishop is consecrated, a step now being considered by the U.S.
Episcopalians and New Zealand Anglicans. He said opposing male
bishops would not feel in communion with a woman bishop, thereby
sundering traditional links within the church.
   The Rev. Nan Arrington Peete, who was ordained in Los Angeles in
the U.S. Episcopal Church and now works in Indianapolis; and
Archbishop of Canada Michael Peers spoke out strongly in favor of
admitting women to the priesthood.
   Ms. Peete told the bishops that under her leadership, her
congregation in All Saints parish increased fund-raising and
activity to help the homeless.
   In her city, ``Episcopal priests as well as Roman Catholic
priests and sisters seek me out for spiritual direction,'' Ms.
Peete said.
   Peers said Canadian Anglicans have ordained women priests since
1976.
   He said women now enrich the clergy ``in a way that had not been
so before'' and ``they promise to enrich our lives.''
   The U.S. Episcopalians and the Anglican Church of Canada have
ordained 1,163 of the 1,269 women admitted to the priesthood by a
quarter of the world's Anglican churches. The majority still refuse
women priests.
   Anglicans are the world's second largest body of Christians,
after the Roman Catholic Church.
   The bishop of London, Graham Leonard, the leading opponent of
women priests and bishops in the Church of England, Anglicanism's
mother church, said women priests already had impaired communion.
   He said people had left the Anglican church in some places where
women have been ordained.
   ``Much greater impairment will inevitably take place if women
are consecrated to the episcopate,'' he said.
   Leonard listed 10 ``profound concerns'' of the opponents of
women priests and bishops. The foremost are that God chose to
embody himself in a man, Jesus Christ; and that Jesus chose 12 men
for his apostles.
   A Palestinian, Presiding Bishop Samir Kafity of the Episcopal
Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East, said it was only natural
to consider women priests when there are women scientists, judges
and political leaders.
   But he said Roman Catholics were firmly against women priests
and bishops and that the Orthodox churches also objected. So
``those who seek the unity of Christendom must take this fact into
consideration,'' Kafity said.
   Archbishop of Brisbane John Grindrod, Primate of Australia,
stressed the dangers to the Anglican Communion of consecrating a
woman bishop.
   He said it might be necessary to appoint a special group to
produce guidelines for women's ordination if the conference did not
have time.

   The U.S. attorney's office is investigating
allegations that a former campaign volunteer for Rep. John Miller,
R-Wash., made threatening and harassing telephone calls to
syndicated columnist Carl Rowan from the congressman's home,
according to police.
   The calls were believed to be related to an incident on June 14
in which Rowan, an outspoken gun-control advocate, shot a teen-age
intruder in his back yard, said Walt Ferguson, a spokesman for the
District of Columbia police.
   He said Rowan reported to the security branch of the Chesapeake
and Potomac Telephone Co. and the police that ``a series of
threatening and harassing phone calls'' were made to his home
between July 1 and July 14.
   ``This is such a shock,'' commented Anna Perez, a spokeswoman
for Miller, about the investigation focusing on one-time campaign
helper Michael Brown.
   No charges have been filed against Brown, said Ferguson, but the
case has been handed over to the U.S. attorney's office, where a
decision will be made whether to prosecute.
   Brown worked for Miller during the congressman's 1984 campaign,
Perez said.
   ``He periodically house-sat, and he's been doing it a lot
lately,'' she said. Miller and his wife, June, recently had a baby,
and Miller has been traveling to his home state to visit his
spouse, leaving Brown in the house alone, Perez said.
   Perez said Miller telephoned Rowan Friday to apologize.
   ``He said that he and June are appalled at Mike's action and
that there is absolutely no explanation for it,'' she said, adding
that Brown ``is not now nor ever has been on Congressman Miller's
staff. Never.''
   Rowan, reached at his home Friday, said, ``I have no comment
about anything.''
   Following the shooting incident, Rowan told authorities that he
shot Benjamin N. Smith, 18, with a .22-caliber handgun after
hearing noises in his back yard. Rowan said he called police and
discovered Smith, Laura Bachman, 19, and two other unidentified
youths by his back yard pool.
   The District of Columbia's strict handgun ordinance requires
that all weapons be registered, but Rowan told authorities that the
gun had belonged to his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent. Rowan
claimed that his son was told he did not have to register the
weapon after leaving the FBI.
   D.C. officials have not yet decided whether to prosecute Rowan
on weapons charges.

<HEAD>Iran Trying To Stir Unrest In Holy City, Saudi Arabia Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia today said thousands of
Moslems were making a calm and peaceful pilgrimage to Mecca and
accused Iran of spreading false reports of violence and unrest to
stir tensions in the holy city.
   Tehran Radio said hundreds of pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca on
Friday against the deaths last year of 402 people in Mecca, and
that police attacked some demonstrators.
   Parts of the report by the government-run Iranian radio,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., were indistinct, but
monitors said they heard no reference to injuries.
   Residents in the Mecca area reached by telephone from Bahrain
said they were not aware of violence. They said pilgrims prayed
early today in preparation for the culmination of the pilgrimage.
   Others reached in Jiddah, 25 miles away, also said they had
heard no reports of violence.
   Iran, which is boycotting this year's pilgrimage, charges that
the Saudi royal family is not fit to supervise the holy shrines at
Mecca and Medina.
   ``Hundreds of Arab, Turk, Afghan, Pakistani and American
pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca today (Friday), chanting slogans ..
. and carrying placards condemning the Al-Saud regime in their
killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in
Mecca,'' Tehran radio said.
   It added: ``According to received reports, the Saudi regime's
police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and
surrounded them. In some sections, they attacked the ranks of the
marchers.''
   Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official
source as saying the report was ``made up'' and one of a series of
``lies and fabrications'' broadcast by Iran to create tension.
   The source was quoted as saying pilgrims in Mecca were
undertaking their rites ``in calm and secure conditions.''
   Tehran radio and television also quoted an Iranian correspondent
in Bonn, West Germany, as reporting that hundreds of non-Saudi
pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca on Friday.
   The report said the demonstrators chanted ``Death to America,''
``Death to Zionism'' and ``Death to the Soviet Union.''
   ``The Saudi police, who had become scared, tried to surround the
attendants,'' the correspondent was quoted as reporting. ``The
rally then stopped moving, and while chanting the slogan `unity,'
the pilgrims asked all the Moslems to condemn the United States.''
   The report made no mention of violence.
   Today, the ninth day of the month of Zhul-Hijja by Islamic
calendar, is earmarked as ``Wukuf,'' or the day of standing, when
pilgrims wake at dawn and travel six miles to Arafat, where they
remain praying, chanting and listening to sermons.
   Saudi Arabia said more than 1 million pilgrims from around the
world gathered Friday in 111-degree temperatures for Sabbath
prayers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which houses Islam's holiest
shrine.
   During last year's pilgrimage to Mecca, 402 people were killed
in riots. Saudi Arabia said the pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians,
died in a stampede. Iran claimed Saudi police shot them.
   The Saudis accused the Iranians of defying a ban on protests. In
April, Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations with Tehran,
accusing it of terrorism and subversion.
   Saudi Arabia has been receiving the pilgrims and organizing the
hajj, or pilgrimage, this year with extensive security measures to
prevent a recurrence of violence.
   Saudi authorities earlier announced that the number of pilgrims
would be restricted this year to one for every 1,000 residents of
each Moslem country.
   The Iranians boycotted this year's pilgrimage when Saudi Arabia
sought to reduce the numbers of participants.
   Iran has charged that the Saudi royal family is not fit to
supervise the holy shrines at Mecca and Medina.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is
planning a 10-day tour to four Central American and five South
American countries next month, the State Department has announced.
   During his visit, a statement of principles governing the
Central American peace process by four regional foreign ministers
is expected to be released, said a State Department official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Shultz is to meet with the leaders in Guatemala City on Aug. 1,
the first day of his trip, and plans to endorse the statement
outlining a series of steps the four ministers _ from Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica _ agree are needed to achieve
peace in the region, the official said.
   The administration is supporting a new aid package for the
Nicaraguan rebels who oppose the leftist Sandinista government.
Although a tenuous cease fire remains in place, the peace process
essentially has broken down with the Sandinistas and the Contras
holding each other responsible.
   After visiting Guatemala, Shultz will travel to Argentina,
Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia to discuss such issues as democratic
development, economic problems and the need for cooperation in
combatting drug smuggling, State Department deputy spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said.
   From Bolivia, Shultz will return to Central America for visits
to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras for additional discussions
on the peace process with the presidents of those countries.
   Shultz will visit all three countries on Aug. 9, two days after
the first anniversary of the signing of the Central America peace
agreement, authored by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   Shultz is expected to use the occasion to reaffirm his view that
the Sandinista government has not lived up to the promises, made
under the agreement, to bring peace and democracy to Nicaragua.
   On Aug. 10, Shultz will travel to Ecuador for the inauguration
of president-elect Rodrigo Borja.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says he fears
a wave of ``retribution'' against smokers, drunken drinkers and
others whose actions are seen as a public health threat could
spread to AIDS victims by the next decade,
   ``Such a response would be tragic, but not unexpected to the
health profession,'' Koop said on Friday.
   He cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and
public ``retribution against drunk drivers, teen-agers who become
pregnant, drug addicts and wife beaters.''
   Koop said it is possible that the American people, ``already
traveling the road of retribution,'' will extend that retribution
against AIDS victims in the 1990s, ``when the annual health bill
for the disease reaches $5 billion.''
   The surgeon general commented in a speech after receiving an
honorary fellowship from the American College of Legal Medicine.

   Rep. Dan Mica has written a letter to
President Fidel Castro expressing ``shock'' over the Cuban
government's decision to revoke visas which he and several aides
had been given for travel to Cuba.
   The Florida Democrat had planned to visit Cuba to inspect U.S.
diplomatic facilities as part of his duties as chairman of a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   But Cuba revoked the visas Tuesday evening shortly before Mica
and his companions were scheduled to fly to the island, citing the
presence of Cuban human rights advocates at a reception given by a
U.S. diplomatic official a week ago.
   A dispatch from Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency quoted a Cuban
Foreign Ministry statement as saying the reception ``was organized
to make it possible for American diplomats to instruct their
counterrevolutionary servants and was not a normal diplomatic
activity''
   In his letter to Castro, dated Thursday and released on Friday,
Mica said, ``I am shocked that you should choose to interfere with
a legitimate congressional visit to conduct internal U.S. business
and review the operations of our mission in your country.''

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand EPA's Acid Rain Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has let stand the
Environmental Protection Agency's 1984 denial of petitions from
Maine, New York and Pennsylvania seeking action against acid rain
originating in smokestacks in the Midwest.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia did, however, order on Friday that New York's
case be returned to the agency for new data because the standards
have been changed since the cases were filed in 1980 and 1981.
   The three states argued that sulfur dioxide emitted from
coal-burning utility plants and factories in Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Kentucky made it
impossible for them to meet federal air quality standards. They
said the EPA was required to force those Midwest states to revise
their air pollution control plans.
   But the court said that the proper forum for giving the EPA
guidance on the issue is Congress, not the judiciary.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church leaders plan to hold a ``truce
summit'' next week with gang members in hopes of stopping the
bloody gang strife that claims about one life a day in the Los
Angeles area.
   Organizers say they hope this summer of drive-by killings,
street-corner revenge shootings, and drug deals that explode into
gunfire has persuaded gangs to gather on neutral ground to resolve
their differences.
   ``We're going to see what's on the gangs' minds. We're going to
try to stop the killings,'' the Rev. Charles Mims, pastor of Faith
Baptist Church in Watts, said Friday.
   ``We're seeing members who are macho bad and looking at their
graves. And they're ready,'' added Louis Cater, pastor of the
Antioch Baptist Church, also in Watts, one of the areas that is
hardest-hit by gang violence.
   The summit meetings Tuesday through Thursday will include talks
between representatives of factions of the Bloods and Crips gangs,
the area's two biggest black gangs that police say have expanded
their criminal activities throughout the West and Midwest. A
representative from the NAACP also will participate in the talks.
   The summit comes as highly publicized police sweeps and dragnets
have failed to deter the drive-by shootings and other attacks that
end in hundreds of killings each year.
   Gang membership has grown to 100,000 throughout Los Angeles
County, with youths enticed by a drug business that can net as much
as $1,000 a day, authorities say.
   Gangs accounted for 387 killings last year, and 140 slayings the
first half of this year, police said.
   Local leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People will try to convince gang members of the importance
of keeping drugs off the streets.
   ``If we can attempt to stop drugs, kids won't have money,'' said
Basil Kimbrew, chairman of community affairs for the Los Angeles
NAACP. ``Then they will have to seek job training or other
employment.''
   Security will be provided by Los Angeles County Supervisor
Kennth Hahn's office. The Los Angeles Police Department and Los
Angeles County Sheriff will send non-uniformed officials to speak
with gang members.
   Los Angeles Police Commander William Booth said he hoped the
ministers could have a ``settling influence'' on gang members.
   The summit, including discussion sessions between gang members,
follows six years of work by church leaders with gang members, who
have pledged to work with the summit organizers, Mims said.
   ``They're going to have to realize that they're worth something,
that they're not all bad, that somebody cares,'' Mims said. ``Then
they got to realize that the killings must stop. I was a prison
chaplain and I haven't seen anyone yet who wants to die. I've seen
a lot people who feign or pretend. But nobody wants to die.''

   The official Tass news agency corrected an earlier

a controversial radar station in Siberia, not the entire station

   The United States says the Krasnoyarsk radar station in south
central Siberia violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
that limits the missile defenses each superpower can build.
   U.S. officials say the buildings that now house the radar
station must go because they could be used to hide materials after
the radar itself is dismantled.
   But the latest Tass dispatch, transmitted Friday, spoke only of
the dismantling of ``equipment.''
   U.S. officials say the Krasnoyarsk radar could be used to help
direct the Soviet response to a nuclear missile attack. The Soviets
say the radar is designed to track space objects and is not subject
to the ABM treaty.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry official Viktor P. Karpov told a
government news briefing that the Soviets were ready to take action
on the Krasnoyarsk radar if the United States committed itself to
observing the ABM Treaty for at least 10 years.
   Tass originally quoted Karpov as saying: ``If an understanding
to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in 1972, is reached, the
Soviet Union will be ready to dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar in a
verifiable way that would leave no doubts on the part of the United
States.''
   That sparked speculation at the Geneva superpower arms talks
that the Soviets had agreed to U.S. demands.
   But Friday's dispatch from the Soviet news agency said that due
to a translator's error, some of Karpov's words had been dropped,
and that his statement should have said the Soviet Union was ready
``to dismantle the equipment of the Krasnoyarsk radar.''

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bentsen Campaign in California With Blast at Bush</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis has begun his campaign for the White
House with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen in a symbolic trip to his running
mate's Texas home turf and a blast at George Bush, saying the
Republicans ``wouldn't know a balanced budget if it hit them in the
face.''
   Traveling together in triumphant departure from their convention
city of Atlanta, the new Democratic ticket made a parting appeal to
Jesse Jackson's loyalists and then flew to Texas to tout their new
Boston-Austin connection and declare their intention to sweep the
state that is Bush's adopted home.
   ``The Republicans are all confused _ they don't know what to
make of this ticket,'' Dukakis said in Houston with the Texas
senator by his side.
   ``And they're worried, let me tell you, because they know we're
not going to concede one single state of the 50 to the Republican
Party this fall,'' he said.
   The candidates left on their campaign stump with praise from
Jackson, but the civil rights leader said his followers will be
ready to turn up the ``street heat'' to make sure the nominees
follow the Jackson agenda.
   ``You ask us trust you,'' Jackson said to Dukakis and Bentsen.
``All that we can ask of anyone is that they not betray that
trust.''
   Bush, campaigning in Milwaukee, praised Dukakis' acceptance
speech as ``very good'' but harped on the differences between
Dukakis and Bentsen, saying Dukakis is far more liberal on most
issues than his running mate. Bush predicted the Democratic Party
will be ``running against itself by the time we get through.''
   Bush was scheduled to make campaign appearances today at a law
enforcement convention in Tampa, Fla., and in Memphis, Tenn.
   Dukakis and Bentsen were traveling together in California today,
continuing their three-day, cross-country campaign kickoff swing
with a rally in California's San Joaquin Valley before flying to
Minot, N.D., for an appearance at the state fair.
   Although North Dakota has but three electoral votes, they were
journeying to the drought-stricken state in part to make clear
their intention to challenge Bush in all regions of the country,
including the agricultural Midwest as well as the electoral giants.
   The first stop out of Atlanta was McAllen in the southern tip of
Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, not far from Bentsen's hometown,
Mission, and later to Houston, which both Bentsen and Bush claim as
homes.
   The Democrats spoke before about 1,000 people in sweltering heat
on the airport tarmac in McAllen, where many in the crowd sought
shelter under umbrellas and some in the heavily Hispanic audience
waved red and black flags of the United Farmworkers union.
   Bentsen called it fitting that the first stop was his home
region, and Dukakis displayed his fluent Spanish to appeal to the
crowd while reminding them that both he and Bentsen have immigrant
roots.
   ``And now we are the nominees _ the son of immigrants and the
grandson of immigrants,'' he told them. ``That's America, my
friends.''
   At a news conference, Dukakis responded to criticism from Bush,
his Republican opponent.
   ``If the vice president wants to spend all his time talking
about labels, I guess he can do so. But we know who balances
budgets and who doesn't,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   In Houston, Dukakis stood with Bentsen, their arms upraised at a
rally surrounded by the city's skyscrapers and before a large crowd
that numbered 3,000 or more. Hundreds more lined the street for a
block as they left.
   ``I've brought a friend home from Massachusetts,'' Bentsen said,
drawing cheers from his home-state crowd. House Speaker Jim Wright,
of Fort Worth, appeared with them.
   Earlier in Atlanta, Dukakis had asked Jackson delegates for
support in a joint appearance where Jackson had declared his
support for Dukakis and said he should be president.
   Jackson also remarked that Bentsen's selection to the ticket
``means the Contras have lost a vote,'' and Bentsen was asked later
whether that meant he had changed his position on aid to the
anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``No, I haven't changed my position at all,'' Bentsen said.
``There are those things where we're going to have some
differences. I think that showed some of the qualities of this man,
that he's quite willing to listen to different viewpoints.''

<HEAD>Contras To Seek New Peace Talks; Bermudez To Give Up Military
Command</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUAN MALTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Nicaraguan rebels,
struggling to quell internal dissent, say they will seek a new
round of peace talks with the leftist Sandinista government.
   Alfredo Cesar, one of the seven Contra directors, said Friday he
is asking President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica to arrange the talks.
   Cesar also said Col. Enrique Bermudez, a controversial hardliner
who was elected to the rebel political leadership this week, will
step down as military commander of the U.S.-backed rebel forces.
   Cesar told a news conference that Bermudez will be ``the
military supervisor of our military forces, but without any
command.''
   The Sandinistas have said Bermudez's election to the political
directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance makes ``the possibility of
negotiating peace even more remote.''
   The Contras and the Sandinistas have been trying to negotiate an
end to their seven-year war since March. The talks have been
prompted in large part by the regional peace plan that won Arias
last year's Nobel Peace Prize.
   Cesar is the chief Contra negotiator in the talks.
   The last round of talks ended in a stalemate on June 9, and no
new talks have been scheduled. A temporary truce, however, is still
in place after repeated extensions.
   The Sandinistas accused the CIA of engineering Bermudez's
election to the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance.
They said his election removes the Contra leadership's ``civilian
mask.''
   Bermudez, who publicly resisted peace talks with the
Sandinistas, was a colonel in the National Guard of the rightist,
pro-American Somoza dynasty that ruled Nicaragua for 42 years until
the Sandinistas overthrew it in 1979.
   His background is a source of suspicion for some members of the
resistance who fear the rebel movement is turning to the right.
   The controversy heated up after Bermudez was elected to the
directorate Monday in the Dominican Republic. The seven commanders
of the small Contra organization called the Southern Front, which
has a political base in Costa Rica, resigned in protest.
   Bermudez was the top military commander of the main,
Honduras-based Contra force.
   Cesar publicly appealed to the seven Friday to withdraw their
resignations. He said the new directorate ``will delegate areas of
responsibility and, in this sense, Col. Enrique Bermudez will step
down next week from the general command of the National Liberation
Army.''
   Cesar said the leaders who resigned were frustrated that they
were not getting U.S. aid. He said the Costa Rican government would
not allow delivery through Costa Rica.
   The Contra force led by Bermudez got U.S. aid through Honduras.
   Cesar said the Contras asked Arias two months ago for permission
to deliver humanitarian aid through the Costa Rican Red Cross, but
have received no reply.
   Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February.

   Residents say they warned
authorities for weeks about a crack in a concrete water tank that
collapsed, releasing a 750,000-gallon wave that killed four people,
injured 19 and destroyed nine homes.
   ``But as always they never listen,'' Perfecto Guerrero de la
Cruz said Friday as he paused from digging through his house's
rubble with a pickax.
   The gray, rectangular tank was near the top of a steep hill
overlooking a neighborhood of adobe, cinder-block and concrete
houses. A 120-foot-long wall broke away from the tank without
warning about 9:20 a.m. Friday.
   ``We heard a very loud sound, like an explosion,'' said Vicenta
Saucedo, 33. She said she followed her daughters when they went out
to see what had happened. ``I saw a torrent of water flowing past.''
   Nine-year-old Martin Torrez de la Rosa was grinding corn near
the bottom of the hill when he heard the noise and looked up.
   ``When I was running away, I saw a boy over there,'' he said in
a shaking voice, pointing to a spot farther downhill. ``The water
took him away.''
   The water swept away people, walls, roofs, furniture and
clothing. Survivors dug through the rubble Friday afternoon,
searching for buried possessions in this border town near El Paso,
Texas.
   Some residents dried their salvaged clothes on parked cars.
Others cleared spots in the dirt where they placed dishes,
appliances, religious artifacts and other items.
   Three people died at the scene and a fourth died later in a
hospital, Fire Chief Gabriel Rodriguez said.
   City engineer Luis Soria told the El Paso Herald-Post that
authorities were looking into the possibility that the 3-year-old
tank's foundation was weakened by three weeks of unusually heavy
rainfall.
   Manuel Ortega, director of the city Water and Sanitation
Department, said he inspected the tank after the collapse and could
find no defects in materials, workmanship or design.
   The rectangular gray tank measured 120 feet by 60 feet and rose
about 12 feet from the ground. Cracks started developing in the
walls a few weeks ago, said Guerrero, adding that he and other
neighbors reported the problem to authorities.
   The tank was filled earlier this year, giving residents of two
subdivisions running water for the first time.
   ``So we finally got water, but then we got too much _ and lost a
life,'' Guerrero said.
   Guerrero's 17-year-old nephew, Francisco Olvera Guerrero, was
killed. Jorge Martinez, 3, and Jose Antonio Martinez Lin, 9, also
were dead at the scene, the fire chief said. Rodriguez said a man
died Friday afternoon at a hospital, and that his identity was
being withheld pending notification of relatives.
   One person was in critical condition at Juarez General Hospital,
a police spokeswoman said. Twelve others were hospitalized with
minor injures and about six others were treated and released.
   Irene Vallez, who lives near the accident site, said she also
had seen cracks in the tank's walls. She said water started leaking
from the structure's roof last week, prompting her to call
authorities.
   She said she saw water trickling down the street from the tank's
direction about 9:05 a.m. Friday. ``Then, about 15 minutes later, I
heard a sound like an explosion.''
   The east wall appeared to have broken away cleanly from the rest
of the tank. A 90-foot section of the wall was thrown 20 feet
across a dirt road, where it came to rest leaning against a house,
steel reinforcing bars sticking out of the broken concrete like a
cat's whiskers.
   The rest of the 9-inch-thick wall was pushed to the side and
blocked the road. The tank's other three walls and roof stayed
intact. The tank was one of 23 serving the city, Ortega said.
   The water slammed into the homes before draining into a gully
about 100 yards downhill from the tank.
   Mayor Jaime Bermudez promised that families made homeless would
be guaranteed shelter, food and clothing. Water service was
restored to the area Friday evening by re-connecting homes to a
metal water tank.

   Heavy floods and one of the worst droughts in
nearly 40 years combined to kill hundreds of people and wipe out
thousands of acres of cropland this year, a government official
said.
   Yang Zhenhuai, head of the Water Resources Ministry, said floods
and torrential rain killed 544 people this year, and a drought
scorching wide areas of central and southern China threatens to be
one of the worst since the Communists came to power in 1949, the
China Daily reported today.
   Yang said 27.9 million acres of farmland were affected by the
drought, and 15.3 million acres had been flooded.
   The Civil Affairs Ministry this week said 65.8 million acres had
been affected by drought and 24.7 million acres hit by flooding.
   China has about 296 million acres of arable land.
   Yang said 2.2 million people in the interior provinces of Hubei
and Anhui are having difficulty getting water to drink. In coastal
Jiangsu province, 5 million people have been mobilized to expand
canals and irrigation systems.
   ``It's bad that the drought is hitting the country's major grain
producers at the key season for crop growing,'' he said.
   He said irrigation is difficult because many rivers and
reservoirs are drying up. The Yellow River had hardly any flow over
a 10-day period earlier this month and water in the Yangtze River
is down about 20 percent, he said.
   The drought has been accompanied by searing temperatures in the
Yangtze River area, and the heat has caused nearly 500 reported
heat-related deaths in major cities.
   Official reports said Shanghai is running out of chemicals
needed to purify its water supply. In Hubei's provincial capital of
Wuhan, one-third of the city's 3 million people are not assured of
getting their daily minimum of 55 pounds of water.
   Floods mainly affected Fujian province and other areas of
southeast China earlier this spring. But Typhoon Warren killed 20
in southern Guangdong province last week, and the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Friday that heavy rains have destroyed 14,000
homes near the northeast China city of Qiqihar.
   Yang said 10,600 more houses were destroyed in recent rainstorms
in coastal Shandong province.
   He said northeastern China can expect more rain as the region's
rainy season approaches, and people in the north who have just been
relieved of drought are now preparing for floods.

   A federal judge who threatened an attorney
with jail over the use of ``Ms.'' and her maiden name is no
stranger to such threats, say lawyers who practice in his courtroom.
   ``There is no more powerful man than an American judge sitting
in his courtroom. He is a king,'' said Allen Brunwasser, who once
spent 48 hours in jail for missing a hearing before senior U.S.
District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum.
   ``I felt seriously threatened,'' said Leonard Sharon, who was
surrounded by federal marshals when Teitelbaum objected to a
petition he tried to file. ``It's also humiliating because it can
affect the way jurors look at you and your case.''
   Teitelbaum prompted feminists to demand his resignation and the
local bar association to launch an investigation into courtroom
sexism when he recently ordered attorney Barbara Wolvovitz to use
her husband's last name and not use ``Ms.'' during a trial.
   Attorneys who have appeared before Teitelbaum said Friday his
courtroom antics began years ago.
   Teitelbaum, 73, a former U.S. attorney and FBI agent who took
the bench in 1971, could not be reached for comment Friday. There
were no answers at his office or home telephones. He consistently
has refused to talk to reporters.
   Sharon, now practicing law in Auburn, Maine, said Teitelbaum
ordered him arrested and called him a liar in 1984 over a petition
the judge claimed contained errors.
   ``I didn't lie, but if he has facts that say I did, someone else
should'' have decided the issue, Sharon said. ``He can't pitch and
call balls and strikes at the same time.''
   The judge later vacated his order.
   Stanley Preiser, who now practices in Charleston, W.Va., and
Boca Raton, Fla., said Teitelbaum called him a ``dumb Jew'' and
threatened him with jail in 1985 when he asked the judge to
reschedule a case around a Jewish holiday.
   ``He said, `It was the first time I had known you were Jewish,
because I have never met a dumb Jew before,''' recalled George
Mahfood, Preiser's co-counsel in the case.
   ``I was stunned and astounded,'' Preiser said. ``That courtroom
was totally different from any other American courtroom I had been
in before.''
   Teitelbaum stepped down from the case after the two attorneys
filed motions to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for his
disqualification. Mahfood said the judge was ``enraged'' over the
motions to have him disqualified.
   ``He told us it was improper to investigate him and if we
continued, we'd be put in jail,'' he said.
   In 1973, Teitelbaum dispatched marshals to a local court for
Brunwasser, who was finishing a trial there. Teitelbaum had
Brunwasser jailed for 48 hours for contempt for not attending a
hearing scheduled at the same time.
   Brunwasser served the time, but the 3rd Circuit overruled
Teitelbaum and cleared Brunwasser of contempt.
   ``He's got a Napoleonic complex,'' said Pittsburgh attorney
Harvey Daniels. ``He's very bright. He's very knowledgable in the
law. But he's very domineering. He takes over your case and tries
it for you.''

   A two-page letter written in 1794 by President
George Washington was sold for $26,800, almost double the estimated
price, Sotheby's auction house said.
   Sotheby's said the letter, which invites John Jay to become U.S.
minister in London, was purchased Friday by a dealer in Sussex,
southern England.
   The letter, marked ``Secret and Confidential,'' was previously
known only by Washington's draft of it, now at the Library of
Congress in Washington, and through a copy. Its whereabouts were
unknown until Friday, Sotheby's said.
   Jay, who had already accepted the post of U.S. envoy
extraordinary to Britain, refused the post of minister, but he
completed negotiations with the British over differences remaining
after the Revolutionary War.
   Also Friday, Sotheby's sold a death mask of the Duke of
Wellington for $24,700.Wellington defeated Napoleon at the 1815
Battle of Waterloo.

   In the words of Pee-wee Herman:
``Woooooooooooah.''
   The man-child known for his silly knock-kneed walk, nasal
high-pitched voice and childish taunts like ``I know you are but
what am I?'' is talking these days about advertising and publicity
campaigns, following his instincts and growing as a human being.
   Pee-wee's personality changed a bit after filming the upcoming
movie ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' the sequel to the popular ``Pee-wee's
Big Adventure,'' which cost $6 million to make and grossed $45
million.
   ``I'm confident that this movie will do well, and probably will
do better than the last one,'' Pee-wee said in a recent interview.
``I know it sounds smug to say that, but I've been involved in the
advertising, promotion and publicity campaigns on this movie and I
know that everything is being done to open successfully.''
   ``Big Top Pee-wee'' was co-written and co-produced by Pee-wee's
alter-ego, comedian Paul Reubens, 35, who created the Pee-wee
Herman character in 1979 as part of a skit for an improvisational
group in Los Angeles.
   In ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' Pee-wee discovers lust, greed and
ambition. He even kisses a girl for the first time.
   ``I tried to grow a bit in this movie,'' said Pee-wee, who does
not answer questions directed at Paul Reubens. ``I had to follow my
own instincts and my own feelings about what I want to do and how I
wanted to be portrayed or perceived. I didn't want to be stale and
I didn't want to make the same movie I made before.''

<TEXT>
   A Kremlin diplomat asked Iran to help secure the
return of Soviet soldiers taken prisoner in Afghanistan and said
Iran could help put an end to that country's decade-old civil war,
Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency reported Friday on the results
of First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov's visit to
Tehran, the Iranian capital. Tass said ``much attention'' during
Vorontsov's visit was paid to developments in Afghanistan.
   Soviet troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15.
Soviet forces entered the country in December 1979 to help fight
rebels opposed to Kabul's Moscow-backed government.
   Many of those insurgents are Moslem fundamentalists supported by
Tehran in their fight against the Marxist government that took
power in April 1978 after a bloody coup.
   ``The Soviet side pointed out, in particular, that Iran might
make its contribution to the cause of normalizing the situation in
Afghanistan,'' Tass said. ``It was agreed that the sides would
continue to discuss the issue constructively.''
   Tass gave no further details, but the Soviets presumably were
eeking an end in Iranian aid to the Afghan insurgents. The Soviets
repeatedly have accused Pakistan of violating international
agreements on Afghanistan by not stopping arms and munitions
shipments to the rebels through Pakistani territory.
   During his three-day visit to Tehran, which ended Friday,
Vorontsov met with Iranian President Sayed Ali Khamenei and Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, and he held ``businesslike talks''
with Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammad Javad Larijani, Tass said.
   ``The Soviet side also expressed the hope that Iran would
promote the return of Soviet servicemen, who are being kept by the
Afghan armed opposition, to the Soviet Union,'' Tass said. ``The
Iranian side promised to render assistance in this respect.''
   The Soviets say 311 of their soldiers are missing in Afghanistan
and are presumed to be held by the rebels.
   In June, the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
appealed to Iran, Pakistan and the United States, as well as to the
Afghan guerrillas, to help secure the return of the missing men.
   Previous Soviet diplomatic efforts on prisoners of war have
focused on Pakistan. Last month in Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze summoned the Pakistani ambassador to ask for his
help in securing the prisoners' return.
   The Soviets have said they had more than 100,000 soldiers in
Afghanistan before the pullout began. Under terms of the
U.N.-brokered agreement on Afghanistan signed in Geneva in April,
half of the Soviet troops are supposed to be home by Aug. 15, and
the remainder by Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   About 2,500 followers gave evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart forgiveness, money and a standing ovation in his first
crusade outside Louisiana since he was defrocked amid reports he
hired a prostitute.
   ``I thank you for your kindness and your love,'' Swaggart said
Friday night as he opened a three-day revival. ``I thank you for
literally opposing every force of darkness and saying, `We love
you.'''
   The free meetings were not supported by the national or local
Assemblies of God, Swaggart's former denomination. But many
followers had already forgiven the Baton Rouge evangelist.
   ``I came out to support him. I feel as Christians we really need
to stick together,'' said Glorisdine Smith, an Indianapolis
schoolteacher who brought her two children. ``I'm pretty sure other
ministers are sinning. They just haven't been found out yet.''
   Jerri Smoot, 24, made her yearly trip from Danville, Ill., with
her husband and two children to see Swaggart.
   ``I have forgiven him. When he got on TV and told the whole
world to forgive him, I think they did,'' she said.
   In February, Swaggart made a tearful televised confession that
he had committed an unspecified sin against God and his family. The
confession was followed by allegations he hired a prostitute to
perform lewd acts while he watched.
   Debra Murphree, the self-admitted prostitute who contended
Swaggart paid her to perform, lives in Patoka, Ind.
   Swaggart captivated the crowd when he shook the Bible and
highstepped across the stage in moves reminiscent of his cousin,
rock singer Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``I would love to be more calm were I talking about Abraham
Lincoln, but I'm talking about Jesus,'' he said.
   He later directed followers who thought they had committed sins
to the foot of the stage where he ``saved'' them.
   Donald Rodgers, 41, of Indianapolis, was among a handful of
protesters outside Market Square Arena before the revival. Some
carried signs reading ``Ban Christianity'' and ``Ban the Bible.''
   ``He pays a prostitute, gets caught, gets thrown out of church
and still wants to preach,'' Rodgers said. ``He calls himself a
Christian. The man is a hypocrite.''
   Inside, Swaggart urged followers to contribute up to $100 in
cash or checks, promising ``every dime and dollar'' would help save
his ailing television show that appears on few stations nationwide.
   Each cancellation of his show makes him ``feel like my heart has
been ripped out,'' Swaggart said.
   An extensive selection of Swaggart albums, tapes, videocassettes
and books was for sale during the crusade, and volunteers promoted
10 albums or five tapes for $20.
   ``People never tire of hearing the word (of God),'' said a woman
volunteer who declined to give her name.
   No estimate on the value of Friday's contributions and sales was
available from crusade officials.
   Swaggart returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year
while undergoing professional counseling. He said his
multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such an
absence.
   Swaggart, 52, said the Indianapolis crusade offered a fresh
start.
   ``I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal.
``I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'm
more aware of their weaknesses and despair.''

<HEAD>Island Kingdom Bans Fijian Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The south Pacific kingdom of Tonga has banned
visits by Fijians of Indian extraction, state-owned Radio Fiji
reported today.
   The radio station said the Tongan Immigration Department ordered
Fiji's national airline, Air Pacific, other regional air carriers
and shipping lines not to carry Fijian Indians to Tonga.
   Radio Fiji said Tonga, which is about 500 miles west of Fiji,
did not want to be flooded with Indians, especially businessmen.
   No Tongan government spokesman was immediately available for
comment, but the ban was confirmed by Air Pacific's general
manager, Andrew Drysdale.
   Pilots and cabin crew of the airline, many of whom are of Indian
origin, have threatened to boycott Tongan flights in protest, Radio
Fiji said.
   Relations between ethnic Indians and ethnic Fijians in Fiji have
been tense since May 14, 1987, when Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, an
ethnic Fijian, led a coup that ousted the Indian-dominated
government of Timoci Bavadra.
   Rabuka said he mounted the coup to protect the political rights
of ethnic Fijians, who are outnumbered by Indians in the 715,000
population. Many native Fijians resent the Indians because they
control much of the local commerce.
   Four months later, Rabuka carried out a second coup against an
interim government. Rabuka since has handed power to the nominally
civilian government and appointed himself head of the army and home
affairs minister in charge of internal security.
   Many Fijians of Indian extraction are seeking to leave the
country.

<HEAD>Three Bodies Recovered From Canal Where Plane Crashed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into
whether the crew of a DC-6 plane that ran out of gas and crashed in
a drainage ditch took on less fuel than normal in order to carry
more cargo from El Salvador.
   Workers on Friday found the bodies of the plane's three crew
members near Golden Meadow, a Lafourche Parish community about 40
miles south of New Orleans.
   Lafourche Parish Sheriff Duffy Breaux identified the crash
victims as George B. Reti, the pilot; Keith LeFever, the co-pilot;
and Stephen Hereros, the engineer. All three were from Miami,
Breaux said.
   The men were believed to be the only ones on the plane.
   Eugene Roth of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is
heading up the investigation of the crash, said there is little
doubt that the plane ran out of fuel.
   He said he is trying to find out if the crew sacrificed some of
its fuel load to carry more cargo. Roth said he has received a
report that the plane's cargo was 22,000 pounds and the fuel load
was only 1,800 gallons.
   The four-engine, propeller driven aircraft belonged to Universal
Air Equipment Leasing Inc. of Miami and was operated by Fiorelli
Crews of Miami, according to a news release from TACA Airlines.
   TACA had chartered the flight to carry a payload of handicrafts,
seafood and other cargo from San Salvador, El Salvador, to New
Orleans.

<HEAD>Worshipers Report Messages from Virgin Mary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of faithful from across Texas
have been flocking to a cavernous underground church each week to
hear parishioners report what they claim are messages of peace and
hope from the Virgin Mary.
   Crowds have grown from a handful of worshipers into hundreds,
and are expected to swell to 20,000 for a Roman Catholic feast day
next month.
   The largest gathering so far was Monday night, when 800 attended
a Mass and rosary service at St. John Neumann Catholic Church,
parish officials said.
   The worshipers came to see three parishioners who knelt on the
altar scribbling the ``messages'' in notebooks as the congregation
recited the rosary, which is a series of prayers counted off on a
string of beads, also called a rosary.
   After the prayers, the crowd fell silent as the first of the
messengers read from his notebook.
   ``My dear little children, listen to me your mother, I want to
help you,'' read Mike Slate. ``I want you to be in heaven, where we
can pray and serve our father for all eternity. Yes, my dear ones,
you must have signs and you will have these signs ... but it will
be up to you to believe.''
   Messages from Slate, a retired Air Force officer, were followed
by others from Mary Constancio, a former hospital therapist, and
Teresa Werner, a housewife and mother.
   ``My children, do not be sad,'' read Mrs. Constancio softly,
after first delivering the message in Spanish. ``Have joy in your
hearts, have peace. Listen to the prayer that you ask for, the Lord
will give it to you.''
   Worshipers then crowded around the messengers, seeking
blessings. The three laid their hands on those who said they were
seeking help for physical or personal problems.
   Bob Golec, who journeyed to the service from Midlothian, Texas,
in June, said his chronic knee problems disappeared after Mrs.
Werner relayed a message from Mary to him and the church pastor
said a healing prayer for him.
   ``I believe this special healing was a sign to strengthen my
faith,'' he said. Others attending the weekly Monday night rosaries
have also claimed healings, or said they smelled roses or felt
Mary's presence.
   Monsignor Joseph James, pastor of the church built partially
underground during 1972 to save on energy bills, said he and other
parishioners began feeling Mary's presence after a trip in January
to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia. They visited a spot where four
visionaries have been reporting apparitions of the Virgin since
1981.
   ``This has been life-changing for me,'' James said. ``It's much
more life-giving than any of the (theological) stuff I've read.''
   There have been skeptics, but James said it doesn't bother him.
``I can't say somebody has to believe this,'' he said.
   Lubbock Bishop Michael Sheehan is on vacation and has not
commented publicly about the message reports.
   James said he has interpreted many of the messages as indicating
that something miraculous will happen Aug. 15, the day Catholics
celebrate the Assumption of Mary into heaven.
   ``I think we're going to see some beautiful, beautiful thing _
experience her presence,'' said the 56-year-old priest.
   David Garza, the parishioner in charge of planning for the Aug.
15 rosary, said the church is making plans with the city for crowd
and traffic control for the event. Church officials said they are
expecting 20,000 people based on the number of calls they have
received.
   Although James said many people's lives have been touched by the
reported messages and hundreds of people have discovered his
church, he's worried that the messages may stop.
   ``You always have people jumping on the bandwagon,'' James said.
``The question is who will be there in the heat of the day? Who's
going to be praying when there aren't any messages?''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Ship Attack Was Really Palestinian-Israeli Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that an
attack aboard a Greek cruise ship that left nine people dead
actually was a clash between Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli
secret service.
   The Copenhagen B.T. paper said an Abu Nidal terrorist squad and
agents of Mossad, Israel's secret service, opened fire on each
other on the liner City of Poros on July 11 after Mossad stopped
the terrorists from hijacking the ship.
   Israeli and Greek government officials had no immediate comment.
Abu Nidal's group on Thursday denied accusations it staged the
attack.
   The paper quoted Danish intelligence officers and unidentified
diplomatic sources as saying the Abu Nidal group started shooting
after watching a television news report saying a car bomb detonated
outside the Greek port city of Piraeus.
   Greek police said the car bomb went off prematurely six hours
before the ship was due to dock and killed two people in the car.
   B.T. said the terrorists planned to bring explosives from the
car aboard the cruise ship when the vessel arrived in Piraeus with
471 passengers and that the explosives were to be used in a
hijacking.
   Instead, the explosives were detonated by Mossad to avert the
hijacking, the newspaper said.
   It said two of those killed in the attack on the City of Poros
are believed to be Abu Nidal terrorists. Ninety-eight people were
wounded in the attack.
   B.T. said Danish intelligence is working on the case because
Libyan passport holder Hejab Jaballa, identified by the Greek
government as the likely leader of the terrorist attack, arrived in
Greece on a flight from Copenhagen June 1.
   Jaballa previously has been identified as involved in the
assassination of an Egyptian newspaper editor, for which Abu Nidal
claimed responsibility.
   Anastassios Sehiotis, Greek public order minister, said
Wednesday that Jaballa's real name is Khadar Samir Mohammed.
   On Thursday, Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council said it had
nothing to do with the ship attack and that Mohammed has been dead
since 1985. It did not say where or how he died.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has been blamed
for many terrorist attacks, including those on the Rome and Vienna
airports in December 1985 in which 22 people were killed and more
than 80 wounded.

<HEAD>TV Addict Gets Jury Trial On Tree Chopping Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described television addict will
get a jury trial on charges that he chopped down a neighbor's
83-year-old oak tree to improve reception on his satellite dish.
   Arthur Anderson, 59, of Redding, pleaded innocent Friday to
charges of second-degree criminal mischief and third-degree
criminal trespass. His trial is scheduled for Aug. 10 in Danbury
Superior Court.
   Anderson, a construction worker, told police in June that he
didn't know whose property the tree was on. After he cut down his
neighbor's tree, he said, ``Now I can get the Disney Channel,''
police reported.
   Meanwhile, Duncan Hume, the tree owner's lawyer, said he has
asked Anderson to pay $37,000 in compensation to his client,
Charles Marriner, 62, also of Redding, for the oak tree and a tulip
tree police said Anderson cut down on Marriner's property last year.
   Hume said $10,000 covers the cost of removing debris from the
fallen oak and other trees damaged by it, and $9,000 is the
estimated value of both trees. In addition, Connecticut law says
that in such cases tree owners are entitled to triple the value of
the trees in compensation, Hume said.
   ``They are irreplaceable because of their age,'' Hume said.
``Both are ruined.''
   Hume said he would give Anderson one week to respond to his
client's monetary request before filing a lawsuit to seek the money.
   Police said they warned Anderson against trespassing after he
cut down the tulip tree on Marriner's property in May 1987.
   Asked for comment after his court appearance Friday, Anderson
said, ``Forget it.''
   His lawyer, Jeffrey B. Sienkiewicz, also refused to comment.
   Anderson said after cutting down the oak tree in June that he
and his wife are ``TV addicts.''

<TEXT>
   A judge fined a flamboyant parachutist $200 for
jumping off a 43-story skyscraper last fall, but suspended a 30-day
jail sentence on condition that he make no more jumps this year.
   But Robin Heid, 34, who defended himself, promised more jumps,
saying if he ``did not go to jail in the next year, I would not be
doing my job as a citizen. And you can quote me on that.''
   Denver County Court Judge Brian Campbell sentenced Heid on
Friday after a six-person jury convicted him of reckless
endangerment, a misdemeanor.
   ``I guess we set a precedent against jumping off buildings,''
said prosecutor Henry Cooper. ``I don't know how much weight a
county jury's decision holds.''
   Heid, whose first trial ended in a hung jury, wore to court the
same navy pinstripe suit he wore last Sept. 18, when he did a
1.5-second freefall from the top of the 1999 Broadway building and
then parachuted to a landing on a sidewalk 530 feet below.
   It was all a part of a publicity stunt to sell his book. Two
dozen of his skydiving buddies were waiting for him at a
book-signing party.
   Cooper told jurors Heid thumbs his nose at the law, as shown in
1979 when he saluted Yosemite National Park rangers while leaping
off the 2,200-foot El Capitan.
   ``I was very polite,'' Heid said. ``I told them, `Have a nice
day.' And then I jumped.''

<HEAD>Strike Reported Over In Armenia, Continuing In Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some factories in Armenia will work through the
weekend to pay off debts caused by a general strike in a dispute
over an Armenian enclave in neighboring Azerbaijan, Soviet media
said today.
   But public transport and enterprises in the disputed region,
Nagorno-Karabakh, remain idled by a work stoppage, news reports
said.
   State-run Radio Moscow said the situation remains tense in the
regional capital, Stepanakert, where residents have been on strike
since May 23 to demand the annexation of the region by Armenia.
   On Monday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's top
executive body, refused to alter the status of the district, which
has a predominantly Armenian population but no common borders with
the Soviet republic of Armenia.
   The Presidium ordered officials to take steps to restore ``labor
discipline'' and end the strikes in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
But Radio Moscow's report indicated little had changed in the small
mountain region.
   ``The situation remains tense in the capital of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert,'' the radio said. ``Many enterprises
are idle and public transport is at a standstill. However, farmers
of the region have already harvested more than one-half of this
year's bumper crop.''
   Friday night's television news program ``Vremya'' showed
deserted streets in Stepanakert and said only two buses were in
service in the city.
   The republic of Azerbaijan is mostly Moslem, while Armenia is
predominantly Christian. In February, 32 peole were killed in
ethnic riots in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, 26 of them Armenians.
   Activists in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, called a general strike
on July 4 to increase pressure for the incorporation of
Nagorno-Karabakh into their Caucasus Mountain republic.
   One Yerevan Communist Party official estimated that the work
stoppage, which ended Monday, cost the republic $111 million in
lost industrial production.
   ``As was reported in the Yerevan city party committee, it has
been decided to work Saturday and Sunday to compensate for the debt
that has formed,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda reported from
Yerevan.
   On Wednesday, Armenian activists called for a resumption of the
general work stoppage to protest the Presidium's decision. Reports
from Yerevan residents and the state-run media indicated the latest
strike call was largely ignored.
   A correspondent for Armenpress, the Armenian republic's official
news agency, said only about 7 percent of Yerevan's industrial
workers failed to show up at the job Friday.
   ``From the beginning of the work week, practically all
enterprises are working, although in some places there have been
occurrences of `pro-strike' feelings,'' Pravda said.

inch in Providence, R.I., and Columbus, Ohio.
   Strong, gusty winds Thursday blew smoke from forest fires into
north central and northwest Wyoming, reducing visibility in many
places.
   It was a cool night in Kentucky. In Paducah, the temperature
just before midnight was 65 degrees, tying the low-temperature
record for July 22 set in 1980.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern New England and much of New York to Florida, southern
Alabama and southern Mississippi, and widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms in Nevada.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and 80s from New
England to Georgia, from the Great Lakes region to the Tennessee

<HEAD>Four Killed When Plane Crashes Into Building</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Workers in a building hit by a small
plane say they tried to save a man screaming for help in the
wreckage, but the aircraft exploded before they could reach him.
All four people aboard died in the crash.
   ``The flames were shooting 10 to 15 feet into the air,'' B.G.
Melton, a machinist at the manufacturing plant, said Friday night.
``I ran back and alerted my co-workers by intercom.''
   None of the 23 people in the Jepson Burns Corp. plant were
injured in the accident, which happened about 9:30 p.m. shortly
after the single-engine Cherokee 180 took off from Smith Reynolds
Airport.
   A Greensboro pilot, who declined to give his name, said he
watched the crash from the air.
   ``We were on our final approach when we saw a big fireball. I
heard an airplane on the ground radio the tower and ask if they saw
the crash,'' he said. The pilot said the plane appeared to stall
during takeoff.
   Officials at the airport did not confirm the deaths, but a
firefighter, who refused to identify himself, told the Greensboro
News & Record that everyone on the plane was killed.
   A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board in
Atlanta said a team of investigators would be on the scene today.
   A flight plan for such an aircraft is not required and no plan
was filed, said Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration
official in Atlanta.
   The plane had just fueled and reportedly was taking off for
Myrtle Beach, S.C., when it crashed through the roof of the plant,
a three-building complex that manufactures airplane seat covers,
officials said.
   The workers inside the one-story building escaped safely, said
Mike Kingsbury, an employee of Jepson Burns.
   ``The plane went through the roof into the sewing department,''
said Kingsbury, who saw the accident from a guard's post about 200
yards away.
   The fire at the plant was extinguished within 20 minutes, fire
officials said. Five people were working inside the building the
plane smashed into, said Billie Melton, a Jepson Burns employee.
   ``They all went out the back door,'' Melton said.
   ``There's a fire wall between where they were working and where
the plane went down at. Smoke drove them out the other door,'' he
said.
   ``It sounded like a big boom. Me and a co-worker went out the
back door. We didn't see anything at first,'' Melton said.
``Everything looked normal. But when we went back in and came out
the other door, we saw the flames shooting out of the roof.''

<TEXT>
   A jury verdict awarding $700,000 in damages
to a confidential source whose name was revealed by two newspapers
could open the door to scores of similar lawsuits, a First
Amendment expert says.
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and the Star Tribune were
ordered Friday to pay $200,000 in actual damages and $250,000 each
in punitive damages to Dan Cohen for a 1982 story that named him as
the source of information about a political candidate's shoplifting
conviction years earlier.
   Cohen said reporters had promised him anonymity.
   The jury decided that a promise of confidentiality was an oral
contract.
   ``It's very important to keep your word,'' a tearful Cohen said
after the verdict. ``That's the hard currency of journalism. That's
the hard currency of politics. When that currency is devalued, we
all suffer.''
   The verdict distressed journalists, who have faced contempt
charges and jail for not revealing sources, and now could face
damages if they do.
   ``I believe this is absolutely unprecedented,'' said Floyd
Abrams, a New York City-based attorney who has represented The New
York Times, NBC and other media organizations.
   ``If not reversed, this decision opens the door for an enormous
range of real or imagined sources to claim that, in one way or
another, they've been victimized by the press,'' Abrams said.
   John Finnegan, senior vice president-assistant publisher for the
St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, and Tim McGuire, managing editor
of the Star Tribune, said an appeal is likely of the Hennepin
County jury's 5-1 verdict.
   ``What we've been saying is disclosure of an 11th-hour dirty
trick was at least as important as the 12-year-old shoplifting
record which Cohen was revealing,'' McGuire said.
   Finnegan said the punitive damages, associated with a finding of
fraud and misrepresentation, ``ignores the fact that the editors
involved handled the story honestly, fairly and accurately.''
   ``In no way did we misrepresent. Nor were we guilty of fraud in
our dealings with Mr. Cohen,'' Finnegan said.
   Gary Pruitt, counsel for McClatchy Newspapers Inc. in
California, said the verdict was understandable because the judge
did not instruct the jury on First Amendment issues.
   Making a reporter-source relationship a simple contract gives
those who want to sue the press a new way to circumvent
constitutional protections, Pruitt said.
   The suit centered on a decision by editors at both newspapers to
overrule their reporters and use Cohen's name. At the time, Cohen
was a spokesman for Wheelock Whitney, an Independent-Republican
candidate for governor.
   Six days before the election, Cohen gave reporters documents
showing that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate
for lieutenant governor, admitted shoplifting $6 in merchandise.
The documents were given on condition Cohen's identity not be
revealed.
   The day the stories appeared, Cohen was fired from his
$35,000-a-year job as a public relations executive with an
advertising agency, said his attorney, Elliott Rothenberg. Cohen
claimed he lost $725,000 in wages and pension.
   Cohen now has his own public relations firm and made $93,000
last year, according to testimony.
   In a related development, the Star Tribune began recalling all
640,000 copies of this weekend's Sunday Magazine after a person
quoted by name in the magazine said she had been promised anonymity.
   Executive editor Joel Kramer told the Pioneer Press Dispatch
that the Cohen case ``figured in our thinking, but I'm not saying
that's our only reason.'' He said publisher Roger Parkinson made
the decision after editors concluded they weren't sure whether a
pledge of anonymity had been given by the free-lancer who wrote the
article.

<HEAD>Assembly Passes Bills To Question Former President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition-controlled National
Assembly today passed bills aimed at forcing former President Chun
Doo-hwan and his family to testify before the assembly on
corruption charges.
   The bills passed unanimously, with controversial provisions
rewritten in a compromise between the governing and opposition
parties.
   President Roh Tae-woo vetoed earlier opposition-sponsored bills
and urged the assembly to revise provisions empowering it to summon
witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by courts.
   Under the new bills, lawmakers can subpoena witnesses with
non-binding writs of summons issued by the assembly.
   It was not immediately known if the writs would be effective in
bringing Chun before the assembly. The opposition accuses Roh's
government of trying to protect Chun, but the government also is
sensitive to public opinion.
   The opposition controls 166 seats in the 299-member assembly but
lacks the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential
veto.
   Opposition lawmakers sought the bills to question the former
president and his family, who have come under public criticism for
alleged involvement in financial scandals.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, has been on trial on
charges of embezzeling millions of dollars in funds while head of
the semi-official Saemaul Undong development organization.
   The opposition also accuses the former president brutality in
ordering the military to quell a 1980 uprising in the southern city
of Kwangju in which about 200 people died.
   Despite continued government denials, dissidents charge Chun and
his military followers with provoking armed clahes in Kwangju as an
excuse to seize power.
   Roh is one of former generals who helped Chun seize power in
1980. He has tried to distance himself from Chun by carrying out
substantial reforms since the former president left office in
February.

<HEAD>Opposition Challenges Government Over Official Secrets Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers say Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's proposal to overhaul Britian's tight-lipped security law
still will allow the government to keep too many secrets.
   Parliament has been debating the plan to reform the Official
Secrets Act, which was hastily passed during a Germany spy scare in
1911.
   The act makes it a criminal offense for the government's 800,000
civil servants, diplomats and defense industry employees to reveal
any official information _ no matter how trivial _ without
authorization.
   Opposition Labor Party spokesman Roy Hattersley acknowledged
that the Conservative government's proposal would loosen some
restrictions.
   ``But in the areas where open, indeed honest, government is
tested ... the same illiberal rules apply, some of them with
greater forces and with few safeguards,'' he said during a House of
Commons debate Friday night.
   The government's revisions propose to decriminalize trivial
leaks, give journalists more legal protection and confine secrecy
mainly to defense, intelligence and foreign affairs.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
law and order, said that except for two provisions in the revision
``every other move is in the direction of openness.''
   ``No one can seriously weigh these two marginal additions
against the immense reductions we propose in the scope of the
present law and conclude that on balance we are extending the
law,'' he said.
   Hurd said one of the proposals that would toughen the law is the
provision that would make intelligence agents automatically liable
for criminal prosecution for any disclosure.
   The other provision would make all information on security,
defense and international relations which the government provides
in confidence to other countries an automatic official secret.
   Hattersley complained that the provision calling for automatic
criminal prosecution of loose-lipped intelligence agents is unfair.
He said ``...when they disclose information, the rule is absolute,
the criminal sanction is automatic _ no discretion there.''

<HEAD>Assailant Kills Man, Steals Money He Saved For Burial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 103-year-old man was stabbed to death and robbed
of more than $1,000 he'd saved to pay for his burial expenses, a
longtime friend said.
   ``Now we don't have enough money to bury him,'' said Andy
Clewis, 34, who found Adam Owens and said the old man had raised
him as his son.
   The Dallas County medical examiner ruled Owens' death a homicide
after he was found stabbed and bleeding Thursday in the ransacked
living room of the apartment he'd lived in for 14 years.
   Ada Thomas, Clewis' mother, said she'd been Owens' companion for
more than 40 years.
   ``He walked crippled, but he was strong as an ox,'' Ms. Thomas
said.
   Daisy Hamilton, 98, said Owens moved slowly, carrying the
memories of 103 years, which he often shared with her and other
neighbors sitting on his porch.
   ``I would scold him a lot because he wouldn't do like I told him
and take better care of himself,'' Mrs. Hamilton said.
   According to The Dallas Morning News, neighbors said Owens
admitted an unknown woman to his apartment early Thursday evening.
   A ``tall, thin, dark-skinned woman'' came to the apartment on
foot, said ``good evening,'' and went inside with Owens, said one
neighbor. Others said they saw or heard nothing out of the ordinary
until Clewis arrived some time later and found Owens.
   Owens was described as a former Alabama coal miner who came to
Dallas in the 1940s. He was a construction worker and a gardener
until he stopped working in his 80s, Ms. Thomas said.
   Dallas police Lt. T.J. Barnes declined to comment Friday on how
Owens died or whether authorities had a suspect.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Australia and New Zealand
were given checks totaling $5 million to be distributed to those
who were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam
War.
   On hand to accept the checks Friday were Australian General
Consul Christopher Hurford and New Zealand General Consul Paul
Cotton.
   The checks were made out to the New Zealand Agent Orange Trust
and the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust and were part of a
$240 million settlement of suits against the chemical's makers.
   According to figures contained in 1985 court papers, 48,400
troops from Australia and 3,842 troops from New Zealand served with
the United States during the war in Vietnam.
   The checks, $4.5 million for Australian veterans and $500,000
for New Zealand, were presented by U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein of Brooklyn, who oversees the Agent Orange litigation.
   Hurford thanked Weinstein on behalf of the Australian people
``that you have not forgotten the Australian veterans.''
   Cotton also expressed his ``deepest appreciation'' and said that
``New Zealand and the United States are happy to be together in
peace.''
   ``Please express to your veterans our appreciation for the help
they gave us and our desire to help them as much as possible, our
comrades in arms,'' Weinstein said during the ceremony in his
chambers.
   The class-action suit, which was filed in 1978, was settled in
1984 when the chemical companies agreed to pay $180 million.
Interest gained during a lengthy appeal process upped the fund to
$240 million.
   The companies sued were Monsanto, Dow, Uniroyal, Hercules, T.H.
Agriculture and Nutrition, Diamond Shamrock and Thompson.
   Agent Orange was sprayed over Southeast Asia during the 1960s by
the U.S. military, which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops
and cover.
   The herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin, and veterans
contend that exposure to the defoliant causes cancer and other
illnesses.
   Under a distribution plan, $170 million of the fund will be used
for cash payments to American veterans, $52 million will finance
social service projects to help Vietnam veterans and their families
and $17 million will pay for attorneys' fees and administrative
costs.

   Johnny Carson, poking fun at Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton for the 35-minute speech that had Democratic
conventioneers shouting and snoozing, invited him to appear on his
``Tonight Show.''
   ``It would be great,'' Carson told his studio audience Friday
night. ``We won't have to book any other guests.''
   Carson said Clinton had been invited to appear on his late-night
show next week. The governor's press secretary, Mike Gauldin, said
in Little Rock that the invitation had been received, but didn't
know if Clinton had accepted.
   Clinton's speech Wednesday night nominating Michael Dukakis for
the Democratic presidential nomination was widely panned for its
length _ Clinton had been allotted 15 minutes _ and its content,
which many described as boring.
   In his monologue, Carson said the 5-foot-7 Dukakis looked taller
when he delivered his acceptance speech Thursday ``because he was
standing on a transcript of Gov. Bill Clinton's speech.
   ``It's kind of a sad footnote. Clinton's speech is still going
on. Because of the greenhouse effect, it's still trapped in
Atlanta,'' Carson said.
   Jackie Speer, an Arkansas State Police trooper assigned to the
Governor's Mansion, said he believed Clinton was asleep when
Carson's monologue began, and said the governor was not available
for comment.
   When he returned to Little Rock on Friday, Clinton told
reporters, ``Everybody knows I can make a speech. Now everyone
knows I can blow one.''

   _
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) _ After a 3,400-mile journey they
reached the East Coast, but that wasn't enough for some jubilant
participants in the TransAmerica Bicycle Trek who wheeled into the
sea, bicycles and all.
   The trek ended Friday when about 300 bikers from 35 states and
Canada cruised down this seaside resort's famous Boardwalk while
the theme from the movie ``Rocky'' blared from a loudspeaker.
   It was the last stop in a 46-day cross-country journey that
began in Seattle, raising $1.9 million for the American Lung
Association along the way.
   ``We went coast to coast, literally, and we're just an
enthusiastic, excited group that wants to go swimming,'' said Dan
Bennett of Smithfield, R.I., as he held up his bicycle at the
ocean's edge, whooping with glee and spraying champagne on fellow
bikers.
   Nearby, Atlantic City lifeguard Toby Tracy watched many of the
bikers dunk themselves in the ocean, despite a thick fog.
   Technically, the beach was closed because of the poor weather,
``but why should we stop them after what they've been through?''
Tracy said.
   The participants in the second annual event were as young as 13
and as old as 72.
   The oldest biker, George Perry of Milwaukee, led the group as it
followed a police motorcade.
   Will he attempt the trek again?
   ``Did Sir Edmund Hillary climb Mount Everest twice?'' he asked,
grinning. ``No, I don't think so. This is the best and the longest
voyage there is.''

<HEAD>Juvenile Court Commissioner Awards Temporary Custody To Paternal
Grandparents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Temporary custody of a baby girl who was
abandoned in a jetliner bathroom after her secret birth has been
awarded to her paternal grandparents.
   San Mateo County Juvenile Court Commissioner Patricia Bresee
said her decision Friday was based on a finding that 9-day-old
Alyssa Frances LoCasto might be in ``substantial danger'' if turned
over to her mother, Christina LoCasto, 24.
   Following a closed hearing, Bresee decided the home of John and
Frances LoCasto of New York City was adequate for their
granddaughter, said Gerry Hilliard, the infant's court-appointed
lawyer.
   ``The court has decided it would be better for the child to be
with relatives,'' Hilliard said.
   Christina LoCasto pleaded innocent last week to a felony charge
of child endangerment and is free on bail. Louis LoCasto, 26, asked
earlier that the baby be placed in his custody.
   The furor over Alyssa began July 13, when she was found under a
bathroom sink on a United Airlines jet shortly after it arrived at
San Francisco International Airport from Newark, N.J., and all
passengers had left.
   Christina LoCasto, traced through the passenger list, turned
herself in to San Mateo County Sheriff's detectives the next
morning.
   Her husband, who owns a limousine service, did not know his wife
had been pregnant or had given birth just before the flight,
detectives and lawyers said.
   The elder LoCastos, who attended Friday's hearing, posed for
photographers but declined to talk to reporters. They were whisked
away as attorneys spoke at a brief news conference.
   The baby's parents, Christina and Louis LoCasto, also of New
York City, did not attend the hearing.
   However, their attorneys, said the couple would be pleased by
the decision.
   ``This could be the beginning of a happy ending,'' said Vicki
Yeley, an attorney for Louis Locasto. ``The only disappointment is
that the child cannot be moved (immediately),'' she said.
   The brown-haired, blue-eyed girl will remain in a foster home
until Aug. 5 because legal proceedings involving New York state
officials must be completed, Hilliard said.
   The elder LoCastos will have custody of Alyssa at least until
Aug. 26, when another hearing will be held to determine if the
arrangement will continue. Until then, the baby's parents will be
able to visit her once a week under the supervision of child
welfare officials, lawyers said.
   John LoCasto, who works for a hospital insurance company, and
his wife, a civilian Army employee, live in a quiet, affluent
neighborhood less than two miles from their son and daughter-in-law.
   The younger couple have two other daughters, a 6-year-old and an
18-month-old
   The couple's decision to remain together was one reason Bresee
rejected Louis LoCasto's request for custody, Yeley said Monday.

   Ne Win, who wielded authoritarian power
over Burma for 26 years, resigned today as chairman of the
country's only political party and called for a referendum on
ending one-party rule, sources said.
   Five other veteran leaders also offered their resignations,
according to the sources, who attended a party conference where the
announcement was made.
   The 78-year-old Ne Win cited poor health for his decision, they
said. But the dramatic announcement came in wake of bloody student
rioting, dawn-to-dusk curfews and a worsening economy.
   Speaking to an extraordinary session of the governing Burma
Socialist Program Party, Ne Win said a referendum would be held
before the end of September to decide whether the nation wanted a
multi-party system or a continuation of single-party rule, the
sources said.
   If the congress accepts Ne Win's resignation _ which it is
almost certain to do _ party rules call for the election of a new
chairman at the same congress.
   Ne Win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far
more important party post. He was regarded as the most powerful
figure in Burma.
   The resignation announcement was made available from people
attending the congress, which was closed to foreign media and the
public. Ne Win's speech was scheduled for public release later
today.
   Ne Win, who came to power in 1962 military coup, has steered
Burma along an isolationist road. His socialist economic policies
have proved increasingly ineffective. Dissident viewpoints were
quickly silenced.
   But since October, student-led demonstrations have three times
rocked Rangoon and other Burmese cities, resulting in violent
deaths, mass arrests and the closure of universities.
   Ne Win also asked the congress to approve the resignations of
San Yu, the party vice chairman and president of the country; Aye
Ko, party secretary general and vice president; Sein Lwin, party
joint general secretary and secretary of the Council of State; Kyaw
Htin, member of the party's central executive committee, deputy
prime minister and defense minister; and Tun Tin, central executive
committee member, deputy prime minister and finance minister.
   There was speculation that the five would retain their
government positions, at least until the referendum is held.
   About 1,000 delegates are attending the three-day congress which
opened earlier today at Kyaikkasan grounds.
   Authorities announced the congress on July 7, two weeks after
thousands of students and other demonstrators battled riot police
in the streets of the capital, leaving at least nine persons dead.
   Authorities have lifted a dusk-to-dawn curfew that was imposed
on Rangoon following the rioting, but violence spread to the cities
of Prome and Taunggyi last week, with at least four people reported
killed.
   Earlier this week the government radio disclosed that 41 people
who were packed into police vans during rioting in March suffocated
on their way to prison. Min Goung took responsibility for the
tragedy, and resigned from his posts as home and religious affairs
minister and in the 17-member party Central Executive Committee,
the top policy-making body.
   Despite promises of economic liberalization last year, the
government in October withdrew three currency notes from
circulation and offered no compensation. This caused the first of
the three major anti-government protests.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon and knowledgeable Western observers
said these outbursts, after years of passivity, reflected intense
disillusionment with a government that has monopolized power for a
quarter century while leading the resource-rich nation into
economic ruin.
   In the past, Ne Win rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with
the few occasions of open protest. Rarely seen in public, never
interviewed by the press, Ne Win is said to be a superb and highly
intelligent political in-fighter and strong nationalist.
   Regarded as potentially the richest nation in Southeast Asia,
Burma _ with a per capita income of less than $200 _ is among the
world's 10 poorest countries.
   Once the world's largeset rice exporter and oil producer, Burma
has suffered spot food shortages and has had to import petroleum
products recently. Although the state officially controls much of
the economy, most Burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in
from Thailand, China and Malaysia.
   Foreign analysts and many Burmese blame Ne Win's rigid,
so-called ``Burmese Way to Socialism'' for these failures. The
system is an amalgam of a centralized economy, one-party
military-backed rule and Buddhism.
   Probably as a result of Burma's colonial past, Ne Win also
sought to exclude foreign influence.

   The epicenter of the quake, with an estimated reading of 5.5 on
the Richter scale, was 680 miles northwest of the Mongolian capital
of Ulaanbaatar, according to the observatory.
   A spokesman said the earthquake was recorded at 3:45 p.m.
   No other details were available.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on

   Here are some facts and figures on Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas and shares frontiers
with India, China, Thailand and Laos. Resources include fertile
soil, timber, oil and other minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the
heart of the country, is the second largest and the center of
traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins
and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism and
education is widespread.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $200 a year,
putting Burma among the poorest nations. It once was the world's
leading rice exporter but experienced spot food shortages in 1987.
Its economic failure is generally attributed to poor government
management and a crippling war against several ethnic minorities
seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid
   donors and the United States has a modest assistance program,
mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled it from
1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy,
a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He has
imposed isolationism, military control and socialist economics.
   Burma seeks to keep out most foreign influence, including joint
ventures with foreign companies, and has been nicknamed ``Asia's
hermit.'' Tourists are allowed to stay only one week.

<HEAD>New Criminal Code Narrows Use of Death Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official revision of the Soviet criminal code
greatly reduces the number of offenses punishable by death, making
execution possible only in cases of premeditated murder, Radio
Moscow reported today.
   The state-run radio said the proposed revision of the
28-year-old code also frequently replaces imprisonment with fines
and other means of punishment.
   ``The new legislation will be more democratic and humane,''
Radio Moscow said, quoting a Soviet professor, Ninel Kuznetsova.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a lawyer by training, has
spearheaded the revision of the Soviet criminal code as part of his
effort to rid his country's economy and society of a Stalinist
legacy.
   The current code permits the execution of people convicted of
treason, murder, flagrant corruption, war crimes and other
offenses. Soviet media occasionally report on executions but have
never indicated how frequently the death penalty is invoked.
   People sentenced to death in the Soviet Union are shot by a
firing squad.
   Under the revision, ``the use of capital punishment will be
curtailed,'' Radio Moscow said in an international news broadcast.
``Death sentences will be issued to those who committed
premeditated murder in aggravating circumstances.''
   The Soviet radio also said that ``with a view to liberalizing
legislation, it was decided to replace imprisonment, wherever
possible, with other disciplinary measures and fines.''
   Radio Moscow said the draft of the revised criminal code will be
completed soon, and that the result will be submitted for public
discussion. It said there are also plans to widen the role of
defense lawyers during pre-trial investigations and to increase the
size of juries.
   The typical Soviet criminal trial is presided over by a judge
and two ``people's assessors.'' Although equal in theory to the
judge, the assessors commonly defer to his greater knowledge of
jurisprudence.
   Gorbachev, 57, named Communist Party chief in 1985, is a 1955
graduate of Moscow State University's law school, the nation's most
prestigious.

fires that have cost more than $6 million and charred 12,500 acres
in rugged mountains 150 miles east of San Francisco.
   And air and ground reinforcements were called in overnight as
crews continued to fight a brush fire in Colorado that had nearly
tripled in size Friday to 1,100 acres.
   The twin arson-suspected fires in Calavaras County east of San
Francisco have razed six homes, nine outbuildings, seven vehicles
and a tractor since they began Tuesday.
   Firefighters had the fires 75 percent encircled by their control
lines Friday night and expected full containment by Saturday
evening, said Marilyn Richards, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Forestry in San Andreas.
   But the more than 800 firefighters using almost 20 miles of hose
near Yellowstone weren't so fortunate as they tried to keep fire
from crossing the forest's Yellowstone Meadows, also known as
Thoroughbred Meadows, into the park.
   Most growth in the lightning-caused Teton fire was attributed to
``spotting,'' when winds carry hot embers into areas separate from
the main fire.
   Park officials have said they expect the fire to move into a
remote backcountry section of the park within the next few days.
   Fire Information Officer Pam Gardner said Friday, however, that
the blaze was still more than 30 miles from any major park
attractions, and Yellowstone officials continued to stress they
have not closed any facilities.
   Richards said the California fires had cost a total of nearly
$6.4 million, including timber and property loss and fire
suppression efforts. Some of the firefighters were sent home
Friday, leaving about 2,800 to battle the blazes.
   The fires charred nearly 12,500 acres, leaving flames to gnaw
mostly at uninhabited timber country in Calaveras County.
   Meanwhile, some 60 miles south of San Francisco, an
out-of-control brush fire threatened homes Friday as hundreds of
firefighters attempted to gain control of the blaze in steep
terrain near Morgan Hill.
   The fire, spurred by hot temperatures and slight winds, had
burned about 140 acres by Friday night, according to the California
forestry department. There were no reports of structural damage and
no evacuation was anticipated at the fire site, about 1 mile west
of Morgan Hill.
   In Colorado, a full fire team was called in to organize the
battle on Bureau of Land Management land some five miles north of
Canon City on Cooper Mountain, BLM dispatchers said late Friday.
   ``We will have ten 20-person hand crews'' on the firelines
Saturday, supported by two slurry bombers, two helicopters and 11
truck pumpers, dispatchers said.
   The fire, dubbed the Dinosaur Fire because it is near fossil
sites, was burning through an old logging area in steep terrain and
mainly was consuming pinon, juniper and oak brush.
   A blaze broke out Friday afternoon on the Spokane Indian
Reservation northwest of Spokane and grew to about 1,500 acres
within hours, said Dan Curd, Bureau of Indian Affairs fire
management officer in Washington state. Several homes on the
reservation and campers at nearby Fort Spokane were evacuated, but
there was no report of property loss in that fire.
   Curd said the fire jumped lines with ease because of shifting
winds.

   A passenger train in Soviet Central Asia crashed
into eight derailed freight cars, causing its locomotive, mail van
and two passenger cars to shoot off the tracks, the official Tass
news agency reported today.
   No one was killed in the accident Thursday night, but 400 yards
of track were damaged, Tass said. It did not say whether anyone was
injured.
   The train wreck occurred in the republic of Kazakhstan between
the cities of Badam and Kalash, 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow,
Tass said, quoting from an account in the railway worker's daily
Whistle.
   According to the report, freight apparently broke up in one of
the freight cars, causing eight cars to derail and obstruct another
track. The passenger train then ran into them.
   An investigation was under way, Tass said.

   U.S. Secretary of the Navy William Ball
III visited three U.S. warships and met with top local defense
officials during a two-day visit to the Persian Gulf, Navy
officials said today.
   The trip, Ball's first to the region as the Navy's top civilian
official, was not announced in advance by the Pentagon and was
surrounded by special security precautions, including a
bullet-proof car.
   Ball arrived in the gulf Friday. U.S. officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the visit had been planned for some
time and was unrelated either to plans for reducing U.S. forces in
the region or the investigation into the shooting down of an
Iranian jetliner by a Navy warship July 3.
   Meanwhile, two U.S. warships weighed anchor and left Manama,
bound for home after completing their three-month tours of duty in
the Persian Gulf.
   Naval sources said the departure of the destroyer O'Brien and
the missile frigate John H. Sides was part of a normal rotation and
did not signal the start of a U.S. force reduction connected with
an Iran-Iraq cease-fire.
   Both ships are being replaced by other vessels now en route to
the region, keeping the force in and around the Persian Gulf at 27.
   U.S. officials say the fleet is certain to be cut back if a
U.N.-sponsored truce between Iran and Iraq goes into effect, but
that any speculation on a timetable is premature.

<TEXT>
   Imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela today accepted a government offer to visit with his wife
and family.
   Mandela rejected a similar offer earlier this week to protest a
government ban on celebrations of his birthday.
   Winnie Mandela, who flew to Cape Town for the visit at Pollsmoor
Prison, said the prison service had the best intentions in offering
her husband a special meeting with nine of his relatives on his
70th birthday Monday.
   But she said the African National Congress leader had decided to
protest the government's ban on celebrations of his birthday and
the detention of pro-Mandela activists by rejecting the privilege
offered him.
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962.
   During today's 80-minute visit, Mandela and his wife were joined
by their daughter, two grandchildren and an American businessman
who represents the Mandela family's interests.
   The attorney, Robert J. Brown, of High Point, N.C., said Mandela
agreed to grant power of attorney to him to protect the use of the
Mandela family name and its interests worldwide. Brown, who
announced a similar agreement with Mrs. Mandela earlier this week,
said the agreement requires that he consult with ANC president
Oliver Tambo in Lusaka, Zambia on all matters relating to the
family.
   Mandela is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting the
overthrow of the South African government as a leader of the ANC,
which is the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led government.
   Before the family visit, Mandela met with Yusuf and Amina
Cachalia, activists who in the 1950s waged with him a campaign
against South Africa's policy of apartheid, which establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs.
   The Cachalias last saw Mandela in 1962, and had been applying
for 15 years for permission to meet him again.

   Pope John Paul II, marking the 20th
anniversary of the encyclical Humanae Vitae, today urged young
married couples to study the document which affirms the church's
ban on contraception.
   ``I would like to remind you of the encyclical Humanae Vitae
that Paul VI published 20 years ago, July 25 1968, and to exhort
you to read and meditate upon this important document of the
church,'' the pope said during his general audience.
   He said the encyclical ``traces, with enlightened doctrinal
certainty and with profound human sensibility, the necessary
directives for achieving responsible parenthood.''
   The pope also stressed the values of ``love, unity, the
indissolubility of marriage and chastity.''
   After the audience, the pope flew by helicopter to his summer
retreat in Castel Gandolfo, in the Alban hills south of Rome. He
returned Friday from a 10-day vacation in the Dolomite Alps.
   The pope is expected to stay in Castel Gandolfo through August,
returning to the Vatican for his weekly audiences.

   A 14-year-old violinist made her debut with
the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in a performance one music critic
hailed as inspiring.
   Under the direction of Jesus Lopez-Cobos, Alyssa Park performed
Wieniawski's Concerto No. 1 before 4,000 people Friday at the
outdoor Riverbend Music Center.
   ``Her performance transcended this concerto's often commonplace
materiels. Park is an inspiring performer with bright prospects
indeed,'' wrote Ray Cooklis, music critic for The Cincinnati
Enquirer.
   Miss Park, of Lexington, Ky., shrugs off her early musical
achievement as just another activity for a busy teen-ager, but she
already has decided that the concert life is for her.
   ``I'm the type of person who tries to fit in everything I can,''
she said. ``I hate to miss anything, especially something with my
friends.''
   Miss Park said the greatest influences on her life are ``my
family and friends. They give me enough love, strength, advice and
encouragement.''
   She began studying the violin at age 5, started taking lessons
at the University of Cincinnati's College Conservatory of Music at
age 9 and made her professional debut at age 11 with the Cincinnati
Chamber Orchestra.
   She has been making the hourlong commute with her family from
Lexington to Cincinnati since 1982 to study under a scholarship
with College Conservatory of Music instructor Kurt Sassmannshaus.
   She has played at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado for six
summers, and has performed with the Louisville Orchestra, Lexington
Philharmonic, CCM Philharmonia and several city orchestras.
   ``She's extremely intelligent,'' Sassmannshaus said. ``She picks
up technical skills on the violin incredibly fast. I feel myself
more guiding her musical instincts rather than telling her what to
do.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas and shares frontiers
with India, China, Thailand and Laos. Resources include fertile
soil, timber, oil and other minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the
heart of the country, is the second largest and the center of
traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins
and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism, with
minorities adhering to Islam and Christianity. Education is
widespread.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $200 a year, making
Burma one of the world's poorest nations. It once was the world's
leading rice exporter, but experienced food shortages in 1987.
Burma's debt has climbed to more than $3 billion.
   The black market _ fueled by smuggled goods from Thailand and
China _ overshadows the official economy.
   Burma's economic failure is generally attributed to poor
government management and a crippling war against several ethnic
minorities seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid
donors and the United States has a modest assistance program,
mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled it from
1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy,
a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He has
imposed isolationism, military control and socialist economics. Ne
Win held the presidency until 1981, when he resigned.
   Burma seeks to maintain a strictly neutralist policy and keep
out most foreign influences, including joint ventures with foreign
companies. It has been nicknamed ``Asia's hermit.'' Tourists are
allowed to stay only one week.

   The pickup truck driver indicted in a
fiery bus crash that killed 27 people is relieved that the charges
do not carry a possible death sentence, his lawyer said.
   ``He couldn't sleep the night before wondering if he would live
or be put to death,'' said William L. Summers, attorney for Larry
W. Mahoney. ``He's had that answered.''
   Larry W. Mahoney, 35, pleaded innocent on 27 murder counts and
58 other charges filed by a Carroll County grand jury Friday.
Prosecutors had said after the May 14 crash they would seek capital
murder charges that could have led to a death penalty.
   But state Attorney General Fred Cowan said, ``After
investigating into the law and evidence, we concluded it would not
be appropriate to make this a death-penalty case.''
   Cowan indicated authorities did not feel the crime was
premeditated.
   Mahoney's bond was set at $270,000 cash. The non-murder counts
include 44 counts of wanton endangerment, 13 counts of assault and
one count of driving under the influence of alcohol.
   If Mahoney had been indicted and convicted of capital murder, he
could have been sent to the electric chair. The lesser murder
charge carries a possible prison sentence of 20 years to life.
   Referring to the lesser charge, Summers said: ``This has taken a
burden off him. The burden of what happened that night will never
be off him.''
   Cowan said if Mahoney were sentenced to life on one murder
count, he would have to serve at least 12 years before being
eligible for parole.
   Also Friday, the state medical examiner announced in Louisville
that the 24 children and three adults killed in the crash died of
smoke inhalation after the bus and the truck, which was going the
wrong way, collided on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. The bus,
owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church, was returning
from an outing to an amusement park in Ohio.
   The examiner, Dr. George Nichols, said that alcohol was found in
the bodies of four children, but he attributed this to a natural
process and not drinking.
   ``I believe the alcohol showed up because of the post-mortem
fermentation of blood sugar,'' Nichols said, adding that the
children probably had not drunk alcoholic beverages.
   The recommendation for capital murder had been made by Carroll
County Commonwealth Attorney John Ackman Jr., who suffered a heart
attack shortly after the accident, prompting the attorney general's
office to take over the case.
   Paul Richwalsky, the case's chief prosecutor, said he met with
more than 40 relatives of the victims Thursday night to explain the
less serious charge.
   Asked if any of the families were disappointed with the
decision, Richwalsky said, ``I can't say that. We had a frank and
candid discussion. If anyone was disappointed or disagreed, they
didn't verbalize it to me.''

   A submarine collided today with a fishing boat off
the port of Yokosuka, and police said 29 people were missing.
   The 2,200-ton Nadashio, a Maritime Self-Defense Force submarine,
collided with the fishing boat, the 150-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, two
miles off Yokosuka in the mouth of Tokyo Bay, Yokosuka police said.
   Police said 48 people, including 39 sport fishermen, were on
board the fishing boat, which sank less than two minutes after the
collision.
   Police officials said 19 fishermen and crewmen were rescued from
the boat, including a 38-year-old man who was hospitalized in
serious condition, and that the remaining 29 people aboard the boat
were missing.
   Previous police reports had said about 20 people were missing.
   There were no reports of injuries among the 75 men aboard the
submarine or on the extent of damage to the vessel, Maritime
Self-Defense Force officials said.
   Nineteen vessels and six helicopters from the Maritime
Self-Defense Force, Japan's navy, and the Maritime Safety Agency,
Japan's coast guard, were searching for the missing people, police
said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   At the time of the collision, the submarine was cruising on the
surface of the water on its way back to Yokosuka after a training
exercise, while the fishing boat was leaving Tokyo Bay, the
officials said.
   The submarine, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, was
commissioned in March 1984. It has two diesel engines and is
equipped with six torpedo tubes.
   Defense Agency officials said the collision was the worst
involving Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels and civilian boats
since World War II.
   It was the first collision in Japan between a submarine and a
Japanese civilian ship since 1981, when a U.S. nuclear submarine
hit a freighter, killing two people, Kyodo News Service reported.

   Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport is in
danger of losing the title of world's busiest which it won last
year from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   O'Hare was leading the race through the first half of the year,
according to Federal Aviation Administration figures reported
Friday. Through June, O'Hare had handled 397,033 takeoffs and
landings to Hartsfield's 396,722.
   That was a narrower margin, however, than the first quarter
figures, which put O'Hare at 196,589 and Hartsfield at 192,211.
   Last year, Hartsfield for the first time was the world's busiest
airport, handling 797,037 flights to O'Hare's 791,907.
   Cutbacks by Eastern Airlines, Hartsfield's No. 2 carrier, are
the biggest reason for the airport's decrease, said John Braden,
spokesman for the city's Aviation Department.
   Eastern has cut its schedule from an average 338 flights a day
at Hartsfield in February to 272 in June.
   Delta Air Lines, Hartsfield's top carrier, has 397 daily flights
there.

   Residents of the village of Dinna, about 60 miles southwest of

   A bomb exploded today about a
mile from Northern Ireland's border with Ireland, killing a man,
his wife and their 7-year-old son and injuring an unknown number of
others, Belfast police said.
   Cardinal John O'Connor, on a pilgrimage for peace in Northern
Ireland, denounced the bombing as an outrage. ``Here we are on a
pilgrimage for peace,'' O'Connor told reporters in Knock. ``How can
we be anything but repelled?''
   The blast, which occurred on the main road between Dublin and
Belfast, blew a Land Rover jeep off the road and left a crater in
the pavement.
   Police said a number of people were injured, but they did not
know how many. They said three people who were riding in two cars
near the explosion were taken to a nearby hospital with minor
injuries.
   There were no claims of responsibility for the bombing, which
took place at about 10 a.m. close to a gas station near Newry, 30
miles southwest of Belfast, police said.
   They said they had not established the identities of the three
dead. The British news agency Press Association said the family
came from County Down, the site of the blast, and had flown in to
Dublin Airport earlier that day from a vacation in the United
States.
   ``When I came out from getting petrol (gas), I saw parts of
bodies lying all over the road,'' said a witness, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``A Land Rover was blown into a field and
two other cars were damaged.''
   ``There was a thick column of smoke rising up into the air,''
Press Association quoted another witness as saying.
   ``Helicopters were landing and taking off again and there was a
fleet of ambulances being allowed through,'' another said. ``From
what I could see there were a couple of cars lying in the crater.
There was debris everywhere.''
   The explosion occurred near the spot where a Northern Ireland
judge and his wife were killed by an Irish Republican Army bomb 15
months ago.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule and unite the
province of Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic.

   With Iran's agreement this week to participate in a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire, and a South Africa-Angola agreement
on crucial issues in their conflict, it seemed peace could become a
reality for several long-troubled regions. Here is a summary of
bloody conflicts with prospects for negotiated settlements:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAN-IRAQ</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: September 1980.
   WHY: Ancient enemies, the Persians of Iran and Arabs of Iraq
went to war anew when minor border skirmishes were followed by a
full-scale Iraqi invasion. Iran's Islamic fundamentalism clashed
with Iraq's modernizing socialism.
   TACTICS: Attacks on shipping, particularly oil tankers, in
Persian Gulf. ``War of the cities'' missile attacks on civilian
populations. Widespread reports of use of chemical weapons by both
sides. Casualties estimated at 1 million people killed or wounded.
   CURRENT STATUS: Fighting continues but Iran last week agreed to
accept a U.N. resolution that could end the war. Iraq accepted the
resolution last year. No agreement on format of talks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANGOLA-SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WAR STARTED: In 1966, the South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) began guerrilla attacks on the South African
administration in South-West Africa (Namibia). In Angola, civil war
continued after independence from Portugal in 1975 between the new
Marxist government and the rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
   WHY: SWAPO is fighting for Namibian independence from South
Africa. In Angola, UNITA contends the Marxist government that took
over with Soviet help reneged on an agreement to share power.
   TACTICS: Angola and South Africa accuse each other of supporting
rebels seeking to overthrow their governments. Angola is backed by
Soviet aid and Cuban troops, now believed to number 50,000. UNITA
fights with the aid of South Africa and the United States. South
Africa escalated its role in the war a year ago, moving troops into
southern Angola on a long-term basis.
   CURRENT STATUS: Last week, South Africa, Angola and Cuba agreed
to principles to end clashes among their troops in southern Angola,
and to give South-West Africa (Namibia) its independence.

   WAR STARTED: Small-scale resistance began soon after the leftist
Sandinistas ousted the right-wing strongman President Anastasio
Somoza in 1979.
   WHY: Contra rebels condemn the Sandinistas as authoritarian
communists.
   TACTICS: Mostly Contra infiltration from bases in Honduras.
United States supplies aid to Contra rebels. Nicaragua says more
than 26,500 people have been killed in the war.
   CURRENT STATUS: Nicaragua last Tuesday extended a unilateral
truce until Aug. 30, and called on the Contras to resume talks to
work out a permanent cease-fire. Rifts between ``hawks'' and
``doves'' in Contra ranks have left the rebels in disarray.

   WAR STARTED: In April 1978, pro-Soviet Marxist party of
Afghanistan overthrew the Afghan republic, and the anti-communist
resistance began. Soviets deployed troops in 1979.
   WHY: Largely fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas oppose communism.
Soviets have backed allied Afghan government.
   TACTICS: Guerrilla ambushes and sieges of provincial fortresses.
Soviet air attacks against guerrilla bases. Moslem rebels receive
arms shipped through neighboring Pakistan from United States.
Surveys in 1987 estimated more than 1.2 million Afghans have died
in war. Some 5 million have fled to Pakistan and Iran.
   CURRENT STATUS: Soviet withdrawal that began May 15 continues
under U.N. supervision, and is to be completed by Feb. 15, 1989.
Accords were mediated by United Nations and signed by neighbors
Pakistan and Afghanistan, with Washington and Moscow acting as
guarantors.

   WAR STARTED: Vietnam invaded in 1978, driving out communist
Khmer Rouge, who had governed since 1975. Groups including Khmer
Rouge seeking to oust Vietnam have fought guerrilla war since.
   WHY: After years of border disputes and ideological clashes,
Vietnam, with close ties to the Soviet Union, drove out the Chinese
Communist-supported Khmer Rouge and established a Vietnamese-backed
government in Cambodia.
   TACTICS: War waged only in dry season. Mostly small-scale
guerrilla engagements. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees
have poured into neighboring Thailand. About 2 million of
Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest before the Vietnamese ended their rule.
Vietnam said 25,000 of its soldiers have been killed since 1978.
Cambodian guerrilla casualties are unknown.
   CURRENT STATUS: Talks begin Monday, July 25, for a peaceful
solution, to be followed by talks on Cambodia between the Soviet
Union and China. Vietnam is withdrawing its troops from Cambodia
and says they all will be out by 1990.

<HEAD>Mysterious Attacks May Be Hungry, Sex-Starved Catfish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UKIAH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spate of mysterious fish attacks on
bewildered swimmers at Lake Mendocino may be the result of hungry,
sex-starved catfish, a state biologist says.
   ``I think the fish might be a little cranky,'' state Fish and
Game biologist Wendell Jones said Friday. ``The fish are spawning
real late, and in the parts of the lake where the bites occurred,
there is a noted absence of food fish. I think the fish are hungry
and cranky because of the spawning.''
   At least a half-dozen attacks on bathers have been reported
recently. Jones blamed catfish as the likely underwater terrorists
after he cruised the lake on a Boston Whaler outfitted with a large
fish-shocker.
   He said parts of the lake, especially on the east side where
fewer people go, are full of healthy fish.
   ``I don't know why, but maybe it's the weather,'' Jones said.
``We've had some real crazy weather this year.''
   Northern California has been experiencing drought-like
conditions and during the last week unusually high temperatures
have been breaking records daily.
   After reports that the fish were really biting at Lake
Mendocino, Jones netted catfish, bass bluegill and suckers.
   He said he got 13 species, all of which normally are found in
similar lakes. He said he found no people-eating monsters, as had
been rumored locally.
   The catfish are found in shallow water, have a large mouth with
curved teeth, and are known to be feisty when sexually aroused,
hungry or hassled.

<TEXT>
   Democrats, who began their quadrennial convention
with the threat of discord, headed home in dramatic unity to fight
the fall battle for the White House.
   ``This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a
great Democratic win in November,'' the star attraction, Michael
Dukakis, told weary delegates gathered for one last party early
Friday.
   His nomination was a given coming into Atlanta, but the
atmosphere in which he would accept it was uncertain.
   Jesse Jackson's bus caravan rolled in Saturday with the
runner-up in the primaries unsure whether he ``had a place at the
table.''
   Dukakis arrived Sunday but refused to meet with the edgy Jackson
until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary
talks between the two camps.
   Republicans had a ``truth squad'' in town and took advantage of
the apparent rift to boast of divided Democrats and a nominee-to-be
powerless to control his convention. But a show of unity just hours
before Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk gaveled the party's 40th
convention to order on Monday night ended most talk of discord,
although Republicans continued to assert Jackson was stealing the
show.
   After a nearly three-hour meeting Monday, Dukakis and Jackson
declared their differences resolved, with Dukakis promising Jackson
a role in the fall campaign and Jackson in turn promising his
support.
   ``We did not come here for fireworks; we came here for noble
works,'' Jackson said.
   With that, the convention opened _ to verbal fireworks, all
aimed at the Republicans.
   Keynote speaker Ann Richards pumped up the more than 4,000
delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned George Bush's claim of
Texas as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a
do-nothing member of a disgraced administration.
   ``I want to announce to the nation that in a little more than
100 days the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-Stockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-George
Bush era will be over,'' the Texas treasurer said to thunderous
applause.
   The redeemed Jimmy Carter made a prime-time appearance, too,
adding his call for moral government to a convention with a
deliberate Southern flavor.
   Jackson had his night Tuesday, declaring himself qualified for
the presidency and predicting he would occupy the White House in
the future while urging his backers to support Dukakis in the fall.
   In a show of respect, many Dukakis delegates gave up their hall
passes to Jackson alternates and supporters and Dukakis placards
were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed ``Jesse!''
   Despite that gesture, not all of Jackson's backers got into the
Omni convention hall. Thousands were kept out after Atlanta's fire
marshal decided too many people had already been let in, a problem
that continued throughout the four-day gathering.
   Monday's detente had removed the potential for acrimony
Wednesday, when Dukakis won the party's blessing to take on Bush.
   All that was left was to crown the nominee, and after the
rousing speeches of Richards and Jackson, there was some worry the
star of the show might be upstaged.
   But actress cousin Olympia Dukakis, in a supporting role once
again, warmed the audience with an introduction of Dukakis the
frugal family man, and when the standard-bearer entered the hall he
was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his
lifetime.
   His eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the
American dream of his late father _ a Greek immigrant who arrived
at Ellis Island with $25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor. His
smile was broad as he waved to his 84-year-old mother, herself an
immigrant, and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the
made-for-TV rostrum at a made-for-TV convention.
   ``I'm a product of that dream,'' Dukakis said on his dream
night. ``My friends, we're going to forge a new era of greatness
for America.''
   Dukakis spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care
and health care and competence, and sternly about his commitment to
public service and his perceived lack of such in the Reagan
administration.
   No stranger to television or teleprompters, Dukakis' delivery
was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic
music that had entertained the delegates before him.
   He ended with an Athenian pledge to strength, honesty and
integrity, but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt
repeatedly with a chant Democrats will surely take into the fall
campaign: ``Where was George? Where was George?'' _ a reference to
Bush's professed ignorance of administration blunders.
   In the end, Dukakis was joined by his family, then Bentsen and
his family, Jackson and his family, the Carters and other
contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and
ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a
marathon.
   The confetti fell, the balloons followed and the Democrats went
home happy.

<TEXT>
   A man has been charged with murder three
months after the decomposing head of a former boarder was found
buried in his backyard.
   Robert A. Berdella was named in a first-degree murder indictment
issued Friday by a Jackson County grand jury. He is accused of
murdering Larry W. Pearson, of Wichita, Kan.
   Authorities said additional charges are pending against Berdella
in the death of a second man whose skull was found in Berdella's
house.
   Berdella, 39, was arrested April 2 after a man wearing only a
dog collar fled from Berdella's home, saying he had been held
captive for four days and had been subjected to sexual abuse and
torture.
   Berdella was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy, one
of felonious restrain and one of assault in that case. He is being
held on $750,000 bond each for the murder charge and the sexual
torture charges.
   Pearson's skull was found in a shallow grave the day after
Berdella was arrested. Pearson apparently had rented a room for a
time in Berdella's house, family members said. He would have been
21 in February.
   ``We had some forensic evidence, we had some medical evidence
and a good deal of police testimony,'' Jackson County Prosecutor
Albert Riederer said of what led to the grand jury indictment.
   Pearson died six weeks to six months before police found his
skull, according to an anthropologist's findings filed in court.
   Analysis of Pearson's skull showed that the fifth vertebra, from
just above the base of his neck, had been cut several times by a
saw. The cuts were made ``while the deceased was still alive or
shortly after death,'' according to court documents.
   Police seized two circular saws, a hacksaw, a miter saw, a
disassembled jigsaw, 14 jigsaw blades, knives, scissors and
clippers from Berdella's house, according to search warrants.
   Charges in the death of another man, Robert Sheldon, whose skull
was found in Berdella's house, are pending, said Riederer.
   Sheldon was a 23-year-old California man. His skull was found in
a bedroom closet in Berdella's house. Police also found pieces of
backbone and two envelopes of teeth in the closet.

   A former policeman was sentenced
Saturday to five years in prison for molesting a woman he was
questioning about anti-government demonstrations.
   Moon Kwi-dong, 42, was found guilty of sexually harassing a
female student in July, 1986, to force her to give him information
about the unrest.
   The victim accused Moon of trying to rape her. The allegation
triggered widespread public criticism of the police.
   Prosecutors dropped the case for unknown reasons, but the
government dismissed Moon and several other police officers after
protests by dissident and human rights groups.
   The activists contended the case represented violations of human
rights under the government of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   The charges were reinstated after Chun left office in February.

<HEAD>Americans Changing Travel Patterns Under Pressure of Weak Dollar</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY9</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weak dollar is not keeping hordes of
Americans from traveling abroad this summer, but it has prompted
many to seek cheaper destinations, travel consultants and tour
operators report.
   Although some foreign countries are getting more American
tourists than a year ago, overall foreign travel is running at
about the same level as last summer, the travel professionals say.
   That was around 2.3 million Americans, up sharply from the 1.8
million in the summer of 1986, when the dollar's steep slide and
terrorist incidents kept many at home.
   The dollar has continued its downward trend despite a rebound
earlier this month. A dollar bought 131 Japanese yen on Friday,
compared with 151 yen a year ago, while a British pound has risen
to $1.74 from $1.61.
   ``The big factor obviously is the purchasing power of the
American dollar,'' said James V. Cammisa, a travel industry
consultant in New York. ``That's really the driving force.''
   Europe still accounts for about half of all vacation travel
overseas by Americans, and Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Switzerland remain the most popular destinations, with Britain the
leader by far.
   But the erosion of their buying power abroad has driven more
Americans to countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey,
where the dollar goes further, Cammisa and others say. Costs in
those countries are lower and their currencies have not risen as
sharply against the dollar as others have.
   ``It's the value of the dollar, and also the value of what the
dollar buys,'' said Paul Kerstetter, vice president of sales and
marketing for Maupintour Inc. in Lawrence, Kan., one of the
country's largest tour operators.
   That principle is keeping tourists away from Japan, Kerstetter
said. U.S. bookings to Japan are down more than 30 percent from
last summer. ``People just can't afford to do it,'' he said.
   Even when Americans stick with their original countries, many of
them are cutting back their spending or staying for shorter
periods, experts say.
   ``They're buying down,'' said Robin Prestage, a spokesman in New
York for the British Tourist Authority.
   For some U.S. travelers, that means staying in a moderately
priced hotel, or even a bed-and-breakfast, instead of first-class
accommodations, or cutting back or eliminating purchases of French
perfume, British china and other goods.
   A typical seven-day European tour package, including airfare,
hotels and some meals, costs around $1,350 per person this summer,
up about $70 from last year. A room in a moderate European hotel
runs about $150 a day, compared with $100 a year ago, while the
average round-trip plane fare to Europe has jumped to about $800
from $600.
   Another feature this summer: More vacationers going abroad are
using plane tickets obtained through frequent-flier programs. Some
travel agents estimate that as many as 25 percent of their
customers for foreign travel are cashing in frequent-flier awards.
   That could be artificially inflating overseas travel figures for
this summer, since many of the ``frequent fliers'' might not have
taken the trip without the free ticket.
   The dollar's slump, coupled with recent terrorist incidents
overseas, led some potential travelers to delay booking overseas
trips.
   The shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. Navy warship
``raised some concern,'' said David Perlman, president of DMS
Travel in New York. The incident, which killed 290 people,
initially sparked fears of a retaliatory attack by Iran, perhaps
aimed at a U.S. commercial plane.
   Perlman said his agency received many inquiries about airline
security after the Persian Gulf incident, but things have since
returned to normal.
   Likewise, cruise ship operators say business is still steaming
along despite a recent terrorist attack on a Greek liner.
   Travel to Israel, however, remains sharply below last year's
levels because of continuing clashes between police and
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, travel
professionals say.
   Of course, there are some reasons for travel that defy currency
rates and international terrorism.
   Elias Pandelaros, waiting in a long line on a hot street to get
into the passport office at New York's Rockefeller Center, said he
would go to see his relatives in Greece ``even if it's a million
(dollars) or it's nothing.''

   Police in the Holy City fired tear gas and shut
down Arab shops today after protesters hurled rocks and bottles at
them during a tense weekend of both Jewish and Moslem holidays.
   One Palestinian was hit in the head by a bottle, and an Israeli
was struck by a rock and taken to a hospital, Israel radio said.
Police said four Palestinians were arrested.
   In another development, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' closest
aide sharply criticized Israeli policymakers for refusing to talk
to moderate Palestinian nationalists in the occupied territories.
   The aide, outgoing Foreign Ministry director-general Yossi
Beilin, singled out Shmuel Goren, a Defense Ministry official in
charge of the occupied territories, for conducting a ``too
simplistic carrot-and-stick policy'' in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Hundreds of police reinforcements were deployed today in
Jerusalem to prevent disturbances as Jews and Moslems both prepared
to mark holy days associated with the Temple Mount, a site sacred
to their faiths.
   In the walled Old City, an Associated Press photographer saw
police fire large quantities of tear gas to disperse protesters who
threw rocks at them from the roofs of buildings in the city's
Christian Quarter.
   Hundreds of shoppers and tourists, some holding handkerchiefs to
their noses, streamed out of the city's Damascus Gate as the white
tear gas floated over the streets.
   The trouble started after 60 mourners marched in a memorial
procession for 15-year-old Nidal Fuad Rabadi, who was killed by
Israeli troops Tuesday on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem.
   Rabadi's death caused several days of rioting throughout Arab
east Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it from Jordan
in 1967.
   After the procession, police ordered the storekeepers to close
their shops and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.
   Merchants also accused police of overturning open air stalls
lining the sidewalk near the Damascus Gate, where the ground was
strewn with vegetables and boxes of goods.
   The U.S. State Department voiced concern Friday over resurgent
violence in the occupied lands. Over the past week, nine Arabs have
died, including the first Israeli Arab fatality since the
Palestinian rebellion began Dec. 8.
   According to U.N. figures, 231 Arabs have been killed in the
uprising. Four Israelis have also died.
   Israeli officials have said Jerusalem is becoming a center of
the violence after months of relative calm in the city.
   Today's incident took place while the Old City was teeming with
shoppers preparing for the four-day Moslem Eid al-Adha holiday,
which starts Sunday. The holiday marks Abraham's sacrifice of his
son Isaac at the Temple Mount.
   At sundown today, Jews start observing the Tisha B'Av fast day,
which marks the destruction of the Jewish Temple by the Romans
2,000 years ago.

   There were no riots, no wild costumes, no major
protests, no great slogans or chants or buttons, no floor fights,
no surprises and even no smoking.
   The four-day gathering, crammed into The Omni, was the first
true made-for-television production from the Democrats, who have a
long history of anything but bland and orderly affairs.
   There was plenty of emotion, once as Jesse Jackson stated his
case for common ground and again as Michael Dukakis, the son of
immigrants, accepted the presidential nomination.
   But this party was all business.
   Delegates were well-behaved inside and outside the hall. Dukakis
signs went down when Jackson's went up. Jackson banners disappeared
when Dukakis took the stage. Unity was the rule of the road. And
everything was more or less on cue, from the delegates' shuttle
buses to the tiny American flags passed out at the finale.
   You'd think they were Republicans or something.
   Sure, some in the Wisconsin delegation wore cheese heads and
bounced an inflated cow up and down the rows. But even the tropical
flowers decorating Hawaii's state sign were plastic.
   ``I've been going to conventions since 1968. This is an amazing
convention, and one of the big factors is that everything,
everything is designed for television,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana.
   On the sidewalks, buttons offered little more radical than a
likeness of George Bush with the red universal ``No'' sign. At the
protest zone, porta-potties sometimes outnumbered the protesters.
   And even the signs were predictable. Unions were against
Lorenzo. District of Columbians were for statehood. Iowans were for
farmers. Georgians were for peaches. More radical sentiment can be
found at high school basketball games.
   In fact everything in The Omni was so carefully set up for
television, the building's regular lights were left off in favor of
a specially constructed, low-hanging light system.
   Can't have that cavernous basketball arena look, you see.
   The salmon-colored paint decorating the podium appeared red on
television. Workers never finished painting all of the podium, but
the bare spots were out of camera sight. The spontaneous outburst
for Dukakis' nomination was carefully orchestrated by a Hollywood
producer. Even the chant, ``Where was George?'' had been rehearsed.
   When Dukakis finally appeared before delegates some three days
and five hours into the convention, he told them the presidential
race ``isn't about ideology, it's about competence.''
   He could have said the same about the convention itself. The
Democrats wanted to show they could be organized, could look good,
and could be ``presidential.''
   By Thursday night, they seemed to genuinely like what they had
done.
   There was a caucus or reception for everyone: women, Hispanics,
blacks, state chairmen, gays, rurals, urbans, former cabinet
members, former Carter White House staffers. There was even an
anti-convention convention down the street.
   There were some unusual twists to life in Atlanta last week. The
party of the poor sold T-shirts for $15. A former White House chef
taught a cooking class on Nancy Reagan's orange flambe. Gary Hart
was a reporter, Lou Grant (Ed Asner) was a politico, and Sam
Donaldson was a celebrity.
   Vendors tried to sell newspapers outside the convention complex,
even though they were given away inside. The party of inclusion
found itself locking out delegates and VIPs during the presidential
roll call.
   It didn't really matter. The Democrats wanted an efficient show.
   Horrigan, whoever he is, was running for president. Dukakis was
running with Glenn _ on some buttons. The politics was all pretty
predictable _ no brokered convention, no ``Mario Scenerio.''
   The Democrats weren't fazed. It was all according to plan.
   ``This is the best convention we've run in a long time,'' House
Speaker Jim Wright told the delegates.
   Right on cue.

   The Navy's highest-ranking admiral said the
Latin American drug smuggling network has thousands of boats and
planes and is so extensive it is impossible to shut off cocaine
shipments arriving in the United States.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost said during a speech to the
Commonwealth Club on Friday that the only way to stop the drug flow
is to cut off demand.
   Even if the entire resources of the U.S. military and law
enforcement could be thrown into the fight against drugs, it could
not stop the flow, he said.
   In a speech on the strategic value of Latin America, the admiral
said Americans do not realize the importance of Latin America to
the peace and security of the United States.
   His audience probably expected him to talk about the Persian
Gulf, the Pentagon procurement scandal ``or even the prospects of a
certain large gray combatant, well-known in history might possibly
make her home on a certain waterfront not far from here,'' Trost
said, referring to the possibility that the battleship Missouri
might be based in San Francisco.
   He said he was not going to ``Monday morning quarterback'' the
decision of the captain of the cruiser Vincennes to shoot down an
approaching Iranian passenger plane that the captain said he
mistook for a war plane mounting an attack.
   ``It was clearly a tragic accident,'' said Trost.

   The Sandinista government has taken
another step toward putting a label on its political ideology:
socialist. But questions remain about the brand of socialism the
Sandinistas have established.
   For one thing, Nicaragua maintains a mixed economy rather than a
completely socialist one, with some market forces continuing to
operate.
   The latest Sandinista statement on ideology came during a
ceremony last week marking the ninth anniversary of the Sandinista
revolution. President Daniel Ortega told the crowd that Nicaragua
had been a socialist state since 1979.
   Previously, government leaders described themselves simply as
Sandinistas after Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought a U.S. Marine
intervention in the country in the late 1920s.
   ``Sandinismo is the Nicaraguan application of three great
currents of universal thought: Marxism, Christianity and
nationalism,'' Bayardo Arce, one of the ruling party's hard-liners,
once said in an interview with the Sandinista newspaper Barricada.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge and Vice President Sergio Ramirez
also have said that Marxism is one ingredient of the Sandinista
philosopy.
   In his speech, Ortega said socialism in Nicaragua means defense
of workers, farmers and producers. He said it means a mixed
economy, political pluralism and a non-aligned foreign policy.
   ``Our socialism is to protect all Nicaraguan producers that
really have the desire to produce, to be efficient and share the
riches with all,'' he said. ``This is all we ask and insist.''
   Socialism, in its purest form, is public ownership of the means
of production, with all members of the community sharing in what is
produced. Aspects of socialist economics are present in many
systems, ranging from those in Sweden and Britain to Cuba and the
Soviet Union. Such systems vary greatly, however, in the degree of
social welfare they provide and the freedom of expression and
political activity they permit.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front maintains the ability
to control almost all facets of life, but keeps some trappings of
an open society.
   The Sandinistas permit public political opposition, for
instance, while maintaining control of the seven-party National
Assembly. Eleven other parties exist, most of them small and
ranging from the ultra-left to the right. The government points to
the fractured opposition as proof of political pluralism.
   But the Sandinistas clearly define the limits on opposition
activity.
   The government controls permits for marches, issues permits for
buses or trucks to transport demonstrators, distributes paper for
newspapers and bulletins, and licenses media.
   In the economy, the Sandinistas in June withdrew strict wage and
price controls, saying a free-market system would encourage
production. The government owns the banks, however, meaning it has
control of credit, loans, distribution of scarce foreign exchange
and regulation of all imports and exports.
   The Sandinistas recently nationalized the nation's largest and
oldest private enterprise, the San Antonio sugar refinery. They
said the measure was economic rather than political. The refinery's
board of directors said the government didn't allow the owners to
buy sufficent dollars needed to keep the company going.
   Shortly after the Sandinistas came to power in a 1978-79
revolution, they confiscated land as part of their agrarian reform
program to give plots to the peasants.
   According to government figures, 48 percent of the nation's land
was owned by private individuals in 1978. By 1986, that figure had
dropped to 29.2 percent.
   Some Sandinista leaders have looked to Cuba as an example of
socialism, but not necessarily as a model that should be
immediately copied. The 30-year-old Cuban government tolerates no
other political parties, no opposition media, no private enterprise
and virtually no criticism.
   The Sandinistas, however, have copied Cuba's Revolutionary
Defense Committees, watchdog groups that monitor anti-government
activity, almost to the letter. In Nicaragua, the organizations are
called Sandinista Defense Committees.
   Nicaragua, unlike Cuba, has faced a civil war since 1981. Nor
does Nicaragua receive the heavy amounts of Soviet-bloc aid that
Cuba enjoys. The Soviet Union is estimated to give Cuba the
equivalent of about $4 billion a year, while Nicaragua receives
about $500 million annually, not including military materiel.
   The United States, citing Nicaragua's links to the Soviet bloc,
cut off economic aid to Nicaragua in 1981 and imposed an economic
boycott in 1985.
   President Reagan frequently describes the Nicaraguan leaders as
communists who threaten U.S. national security. Local opponents of
the Sandinistas agree, saying that left unleashed Nicaragua would
be a closed, Marxist-Leninist state.

   For all their imagery of Camelot revisited,
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen can't rely entirely on the 1960
electoral playbook written by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
   It is 28 years later _ years in which America has lost a war and
a few presidents, gone through a civil rights revolution, seen the
emergence of a two-party South, and swung with the ideological
pendulum.
   The America that will decide whether to vote for Dukakis-Bentsen
is far different from the one that narrowly chose Kennedy-Johnson,
the earlier Massachusetts and Texas combination.
   ``I don't see that the analogy works, other than it's nice
poetry,'' said Ed Reilly, a New York pollster and adviser to
Democratic candidates.
   But they will be able to use some of the 1960 strategy that
Kennedy used in narrowly defeating Richard Nixon. They've already
begun.
   Kennedy was stunned that Johnson accepted the No. 2 post, since
he had sought the presidential nomination himself. But in his book,
``The Making of the President, 1960,'' Theodore White wrote that
Johnson's selection sealed the plan they would pursue.
   ``The first of the Kennedy strategies had been a regional one,
decided by the candidate alone, on the night of his nomination, by
his choice of a vice president,'' White wrote.
   ``He felt he had New England locked up; that he must campaign
personally for the big Northeastern industrial states; that Lyndon
B. Johnson must be his Lord Constable for the Old South. These
grand calculations worked.''
   In many ways this year, Dukakis' aim is the same. His selection
of Bentsen was an attempt to reclaim Texas, with its 29 electoral
votes. It also was an attempt to appeal to white swing voters in
other Southern states, and to compel Republican George Bush to
invest time and money in Texas and the South.
   ``John Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson as his running mate
turned out to be one of the crucial differences of the election in
1960,'' recalled Ted Sorensen, then a policy adviser to Kennedy,
today a New York attorney and author of the 1988 Democratic
platform draft.
   ``Johnson helped carry Texas and Louisiana ... He helped keep
North Carolina and South Carolina,'' Sorensen said in an interview.
``A vice president is only a small reason, but it is an additional
factor to cause people to vote, to return to their party.''
   Robert Healy, associate editor of the Boston Globe, recalled
covering that 1960 race. Kennedy was facing hostility in the South
and some other areas over his Catholic religion.
   The Thursday before the election, Kennedy campaigned in Oklahoma
City in a futile attempt to hold a state so close to Texas. He was
spit upon by the crowd, Healy recalled.
   ``Johnson had gone in and really met that sort of thing in Texas
for Kennedy,'' he said.
   The Kennedy campaign adopted an electoral strategy that focused
on nine large states, White recounted. In 1960, New York,
Pennsylvania, California, Michigan, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, New
Jersey and Massachusetts together held 237 of the 269 electoral
votes needed to win.
   ``It was in these big states that Kennedy invested the greatest
part of his time and personal effort, while Nixon sought to spread
himself over all 50 states of the Union,'' White wrote.
   ``If those could be swept, and if another 60 or 70 electoral
votes could be added by Lyndon B. Johnson in the Old South, and if
a few more solid New England or Midwestern states could be counted
in, then the election would be won handily,'' White wrote.
   Kennedy carried all but two of those nine: Ohio and California.
He swept New England, the most heavily Catholic and his native
region; much of the South including Texas and some border states;
and the small western states of Nevada and New Mexico.
   His wins in Texas and Illinois were razor thin, and it's often
noted that a shift of 4,500 votes in Illinois and 28,000 in Texas
would have reversed those states, and the election.
   But he won 23 states and 303 electoral votes, more than enough.
   If Dukakis and Bentsen carried each of these same states this
year, they would win, too _ but by a smaller electoral margin.
Shifting populations have reduced the electoral votes of those
states to 286.
   That leaves very little margin of error. Moreover, there are few
safe Democratic states any more, and some of the Kennedy states may
be out of reach to Dukakis.
   On the other hand, Dukakis is considered competitive in parts of
the farm and industrial Middle West, and big states like Ohio and
California, where he will mount a challenge, would make up for a
lot of smaller states.
   The South has seen both the emergence of a strong Republican
Party that has dominated in presidential elections, and the
emergence of a large black vote that is reliably Democratic.
Kennedy won black votes in the South _ indeed became champion to
blacks when he intervened to help get Martin Luther King Jr. out of
a Georgia prison two weeks before the election _ but black voter
registration was low, a fraction of today's.
   There have been other changes too, like the switch to public
financing of campaigns, that make a substantive comparison to 1960
impractical.
   But in the end, if Dukakis gets out of his Bentsen choice what
Kennedy got out of Johnson, it may be all that matters.
   ``If they win Texas, they'll all be geniuses and probably win
the election,'' said Reilly. ``If they lose Texas, they probably
lose the election.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas and shares frontiers
with India, China, Thailand and Laos. Resources include fertile
soil, timber, oil and other minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the
heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of
traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins
and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism, with
minorities adhering to Islam and Christianity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $200 a year, making
Burma one of the world's poorest nations. It once was the world's
leading rice exporter, but it experienced food shortages in 1987.
Burma's debt has climbed to more than $3 billion.
   The black market _ fueled by smuggled goods from Thailand and
China _ overshadows the official economy.
   Burma's economic failure is generally attributed to poor
government management and a crippling war against several ethnic
minorities seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid
donors and the United States has a modest assistance program,
mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled it from
1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy,
a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He imposed
isolationism, military control and socialist economics. Ne Win held
the presidency until 1981, when he resigned.
   Burma seeks to maintain a strictly neutralist policy and keep
out most foreign influences, including joint ventures with foreign
companies. It has been nicknamed ``Asia's hermit.'' Tourists are
allowed to stay only one week.

<HEAD>Police Nab Two Alleged Pickpockets Using Mustard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two groups of pickpockets armed with mustard
have been arrested at Kennedy International Airport, where they had
been preying on foreign tourists, a Port Authority spokesman said.
   The arrests were made Friday night by an undercover team
fighting a rash of incidents over the past six weeks involving
mainly Japanese tourists, said Mark Marchese, a spokesman for the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   A technique becoming common among pickpockets is to discreetly
squirt the intended victim with mustard or ketchup, then point it
out and pretend to help him clean up. While the person is
distracted, his pocket is picked or his bags stolen.
   The first group was arrested about 7:45 p.m. when undercover
Port Authority police saw three men and a woman crowd a Japanese
woman in the Pan American Worldport Terminal, Marchese said. The
woman had just gotten off a plane from Japan and had her luggage
with her.
   Two of the men engaged her in conversation while a third was
feeling her luggage, according to the report filed by PA Detective
Evan Goodstein. Police moved in to arrest the four, all from
Queens, when the woman pickpocket took out a jar of mustard and
opened it, Marchese said.
   Five minutes later, police saw three men approach a man who had
just disembarked from the same plane.
   ``One man squirted mustard on his sleeve, the second began
wiping it off,'' Marchese said. Police moved in as the third man
went for the victim's bag. Thre three ran out of the terminal but
their car was stopped as it was trying to leave the airport.
   The seven were all charged with jostling, a Class A misdemeanor
punishable by up to one year in jail upon conviction, he said. The
undercover operation at Kennedy will continue, Marchese said.

<HEAD>Annual Moslem Pilgrimage Comes to Climax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of white-robed
Moslems prayed, chanted and listened to sermons on Mount Arafat in
108-degree heat Saturday during the climax of the annual pilgrimage
to Mecca.
   Iran said there were protests in the holy city, but a Saudi
official denied the report.
   For the second time since Wednesday, Tehran radio said there
were political demonstrations against the ruling Saudi family and
against the United States, Soviet Union and Israel.
   The Iranian government-run radio also claimed police
``attacked'' some demonstrators. Saudi authorities, however, said
the pilgrimage, or hajj, proceeded in ``peace and security.''
   The pilgrims on Saturday ascended to Nimra Mosque on Mount
Arafat after trekking from Mecca, nine miles away.
   Smiling men and women draped in their seamless white pieces of
cloth brandished copies of the Koran, Moslems' holy book, during
the ceremony inside the mosque. The ceremony was broadcast live on
Saudi television and via satellite.
   In their midst were Saudi security men, dressed in green
fatigues and caps. Authorities said 20,000 of them guarded the
pilgrimage. The pilgrimage season officially began July 15 with the
sighting of the crescent moon, marking the start of the Moslem holy
month of Eid al-Adha.
   The ``Wukuf,'' or standing at Arafat, represents the culmination
of the annual hajj, which all of the world's 850 million Moslems
are expected to make at least once if they can afford it.
   The culmination includes the stoning of the devil, in
commemoration of the prophet Abraham's refusal to be tempted into
disobeying God's order that he sacrifice his son.
   On Sunday, after slaughtering sheep to represent the sacrifice
of a sheep instead of Abraham's son, the pilgrims begin a four-day
feast.
   Prayer leader Sheik Abdel-Aziz Al-Sheikh called upon Moslems to
respect and maintain the sanctity of Mecca's Grand Mosque as
``Allah has made it a place of refuge and security.''
   Outside Nimra Mosque, waves of black and colored umbrellas
shaded pilgrims from the sun as loudspeakers broadcast the ceremony.
   The temperature was about five degrees cooler than average for
this time of year, but many cases of heat exhaustion and sunstroke
were reported.
   On Friday, the pilgrims gathered for prayers at the Grand Mosque
in Mecca, which harbors the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine.
   It was after those prayers, according to Tehran radio, that
hundreds of pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca against the deaths last
year of 402 people, mostly Iranian pilgrims, in the holy city.
   Saudi authorities said many of those killed last year were
trampled in a stampede, and they denied Iranian claims that police
opened fire on the march.
   Parts of the latest report by the Tehran radio, monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp., were indistinct, but monitors said they
heard no reference to injuries.
   ``Hundreds of Arab, Turk, Afghan, Pakistani and American
pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca today (Friday), chanting slogans ..
. and carrying placards condemning the Al-Saud regime in their
killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in
Mecca,'' Tehran radio said.
   It added: ``According to received reports, the Saudi regime's
police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and
surrounded them. In some sections they attacked the ranks of the
marchers.''
   Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official
source as saying the report was ``made up'' and one of a series of
``lies and fabrications'' broadcast by Iran to create tension.
   Gen. Abdullah Abdel-Rahman Al-Sheikh, director general of Saudi
security, said there were no incidents.
   Prince Majed, governor of Mecca, issued a statement to the radio
hailing the ``success'' of the hajj rituals.
   By Saudi count, there are 762,755 pilgrims from more than 130
Moslem nations who converged on the kingdom this year, joining an
estimated half million from within Saudi Arabia.
   There were about 1,000 American pilgrims, according to estimates
by the U.S. Consulate in Jiddah, a Red Sea port city about 40 miles
from Mecca.
   Non-Moslems are barred from Mecca.

<HEAD>Fall Season In Ruins; Networks' Loss May Be Cable's Gain</HEAD>

   The three major TV networks are remaking old
series in a scramble to fill the fall schedule as the
five-month-old writers' strike threatens their already slipping
share of the audience.
   Their competitors aren't ignoring the situation.
   ``We think there is going to be a gaping hole on the dial,''
said Seth Abraham, Home Box Office's senior vice president for
programming operations. ``We will pick up disenchanted viewers in
droves.''
   Said Gerry Hogan, president of the Turner Entertainment
Networks: ``We're in good shape for the fall. We do very well when
the networks are out of original programming.''
   ABC's decision to refilm 13 old episodes of ``Mission:
Impossible'' in Australia symbolizes the peculiar efforts by the
three networks to plug holes left by the 9,000-member Writers Guild
of America strike.
   ``They're going to have a lot of trouble if they use Australian
actors and have cars driving on the wrong side of the road,'' said
William Woodfield, one of the original ``Mission'' writers and
producers. ``And it isn't going to be cheap. Those shows cost
$500,000 to shoot in Los Angeles 20 years ago. To shoot them today
in Australia is going to cost a whole lot more.''
   The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns
of one-hour domestic shows and a bigger share in the increased
foreign market.
   ABC admits privately that its fall schedule is a significant
compromise from previous years.
   ``It's not the original programming we would have wanted,'' said
one ABC programming executive, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. ``But something has gotta be put on the air.''
   ABC is not alone in making improbable programming decisions in
the wake of the walkout that has left TV actors with time to do
other things, like Tom Bosley's return to the stage and Bob
Newhart's revival of his nightclub act.
   NBC has plans to bring back, with a new cast, ``The Hardy
Boys,'' a detective show that lasted less than three seasons after
it debuted on ABC 11 years ago.
   CBS, which finished third in the ratings last season for the
first time, will bring back ``Candid Camera,'' which hasn't been on
network television in 20 years. The program was so unpopular in the
syndication market that it was recently withdrawn from sale.
   NBC also will broadcast at least one news special from TV
personality Geraldo Rivera, and the network may convert the cartoon
``Fat Albert'' into a live-action prime time series.
   NBC also is fortunate to have television rights to the Summer
Olympics and the World Series.
   CBS Entertainment, frequently at odds with CBS News, is
encouraging the news division to produce a variety of specials.
``The executive producers have been asked internally to come up
with some ideas and float concepts,'' said Tom Goodman, a spokesman
for CBS News.
   The strike hits the networks at a time when their share of the
TV audience has slipped to its lowest level ever. Fewer than 60
percent of viewers now tune in the networks when watching
television, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   HBO and TBS have devised fall promotion campaigns to lure
unhappy network followers. They both have sizeable movie libraries
and their original programming is produced so far in advance that
their schedules do not suffer immediately from the strike.
   Movie theaters and video stores also expect to benefit from the
strike.
   Especially embarrassing for the networks, they will be unable to
mount much of a public relations blitz at the annual summer
convention of television critics, starting this week in Universal
City.
   ``They're going to have to use some smoke and mirrors to get
through the first three months of the television season,'' said Art
Chapman, TV critic for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and president
of the Television Critics Association.
   Some advertisers believe the networks may be forced to provide
free advertising time, called ``make goods'' in the industry, when
replacement programs fail to produce guaranteed audiences.
   ``I think there will be a lot of make goods'' this fall, said
Richard Kostyra, executive vice president and U.S. director of
media services at J. Walter Thompson. ``But I don't think of it in
disaster terms.''
   In its forecast for the fall, the New York advertising agency
Young and Rubicam has predicted that only three of the networks' 21
new shows _ ABC's ``Roseanne'' and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear
John'' _ will be hits.
   ``I think, obviously, it's going to be a disruptive season,''
said Robert Igiel, senior vice president and director of
programming at the advertising agency N.W. Ayer. ``In some cases,
these replacement shows may not work.''

   Writer-producer Robert Eisele says the only
blessing of the 20-week scriptwriters strike has been the
opportunity to get acquainted with his infant daughter.
   ``It's been a wonderful time for bonding with Marissa,'' Eisele
said Friday. ``She was born March 26, nearly three weeks after the
strike began.''
   But for Eisele, a writer and co-producer of CBS' ``The
Equalizer,'' it's also been a time for frugal living and a return
to earlier pastimes of writing poetry and plays.
   ``I'm coping financially because I was raised in a sort of
austere middle class existence,'' he said. ``I've always been
frugal with my money. I've never lived beyond my means. I knew when
I got into this industry in 1980 that it had a history of long
strikes, so I saved my money and bought a house I could afford.
   ``I can pay the mortgage. I can hold out for a long time. But I
have writer friends who are not so lucky. I'm going to look at a
friend's sideboard that he's selling to pay the rent,'' he said.
   As a ``hyphenate,'' the industry term for a person who performs
several jobs, in his case writing and producing, Eisele's salary
was ``in the neighborhood'' of $200,000 to $400,000 a year.
   The average writer who does not have a regular job and depends
on free-lance sales makes considerably less and the median income
of working members of the Writers Guild of America is $43,000 a
year. At any given time, only about half of the guild's 9,000
members are employed.
   The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns
of one-hour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the
increased foreign market.
   ``We are very well paid, but we also create the product,'' he
said. ``We are first among equals. Without our vision no one else
can go to work. I think because we do create the work we should be
compensated with residuals.''
   ``The Equalizer,'' which has completed its third year on CBS, is
now a viable show for syndication.
   ``If a show is syndicated, then every episode I've written will
bring in a certain amount of residuals over the years,'' he said.
``It becomes an annuity for a writer.''
   ``They want rollbacks in some areas but they aren't flexible in
the area of foreign residuals,'' Eisele said. ``The foreign market
is growing. There's going to be an explosion in the foreign market
for television.''
   Eisele was playwright-in-residence at the American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco in 1975-76. His first film work was a
low-budget movie called ``Breach of Contract,'' which starred Peter
Coyote and Cindy Pickett.
   In 1985 his friends Terry Louise Fisher and Steve Brown asked
him to write a script for CBS' ``Cagney & Lacey.'' His script,
called ``Ordinary Hero,'' won the Humanitas Award for 60-minute
drama.
   He wrote the first show for the 1986-87 season for ``Cagney &
Lacey.'' He was story editor of NBC's ``Crime Story'' before going
to ``The Equalizer'' this past season as co-producer.
   During the strike he has written a script for PBS' ``American
Playhouse'' called ``Last Light,'' the story of the relationship
between a condemned man and a prison guard. Public television is
not affected by the strike.
   He also is outlining a new play and has brought out some of his
poetry, to give it a polish and send it off to various journals.
   ``I'm getting by because I've always had an old working boy's
outlook,'' he said. ``I've never tried to impress people with my
wealth, not that I have any. I don't take to the Hollywood glitz.''

   Democrats, who began their quadrennial convention
with the threat of discord, headed home in dramatic unity to fight
the fall battle for the White House.
   ``This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a
great Democratic win in November,'' the star attraction, Michael
Dukakis, told weary delegates gathered for one last party early
Friday.
   His nomination and that of the man he picked as his running
mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, were guaranteed coming into
Atlanta, but the atmosphere in which the ticket would be formed was
uncertain.
   Jesse Jackson's bus caravan rolled in Saturday with the
runner-up in the primaries unsure whether he ``had a place at the
table.''
   Dukakis arrived Sunday but refused to meet with the edgy Jackson
until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary
talks between the two camps.
   Republicans had a ``truth squad'' in town and took advantage of
the apparent rift to boast of divided Democrats and a nominee-to-be
powerless to control his convention. But a show of unity just hours
before Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk gaveled the party's 40th
convention to order on Monday night ended most talk of discord,
although Republicans continued to assert Jackson was stealing the
show.
   After a nearly three-hour meeting Monday, Dukakis and Jackson
declared their differences resolved, with Dukakis promising Jackson
a role in the fall campaign and Jackson in turn promising his
support.
   ``We did not come here for fireworks; we came here for noble
works,'' Jackson said.
   With that, the convention opened _ to verbal fireworks, all
aimed at the Republicans.
   Keynote speaker Ann Richards pumped up the more than 4,000
delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned George Bush's claim of
Texas as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a
do-nothing member of a disgraced administration.
   ``I want to announce to the nation that in a little more than
100 days the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-Stockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-George
Bush era will be over,'' the Texas treasurer said to thunderous
applause.
   The redeemed Jimmy Carter made a prime-time appearance, too,
adding his call for moral government to a convention with a
deliberate Southern flavor.
   Jackson had his night Tuesday, declaring himself qualified for
the presidency and predicting he would occupy the White House in
the future while urging his backers to support Dukakis in the fall.
   In a show of respect, many Dukakis delegates gave up their hall
passes to Jackson alternates and supporters and Dukakis placards
were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed ``Jesse!''
   Despite that gesture, not all of Jackson's backers got into the
Omni convention hall. Thousands were kept out after Atlanta's fire
marshal decided too many people had already been let in, a problem
that continued throughout the four-day gathering.
   Monday's detente had removed the potential for acrimony
Wednesday, when Dukakis won the party's blessing to take on Bush.
   All that was left was to crown the nominee, and after the
rousing speeches of Richards and Jackson, there was some worry the
star of the show might be upstaged.
   But actress cousin Olympia Dukakis, in a supporting role once
again, warmed the audience with an introduction of Dukakis the
frugal family man, and when the standard-bearer entered the hall he
was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his
lifetime.
   His eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the
American dream of his late father _ a Greek immigrant who arrived
at Ellis Island with $25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor. His
smile was broad as he waved to his 84-year-old mother, herself an
immigrant, and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the
made-for-TV rostrum at a made-for-TV convention.
   ``I'm a product of that dream,'' Dukakis said on his dream
night. ``My friends, we're going to forge a new era of greatness
for America.''
   Dukakis spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care
and health care and competence, and sternly about his commitment to
public service and his perceived lack of such in the Reagan
administration.
   No stranger to television or teleprompters, Dukakis' delivery
was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic
music that had entertained the delegates before him.
   He ended with an Athenian pledge to strength, honesty and
integrity, but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt
repeatedly with a chant Democrats will surely take into the fall
campaign: ``Where was George? Where was George?'' _ a reference to
Bush's professed ignorance of administration blunders.
   In the end, Dukakis was joined by his family, then Bentsen and
his family, Jackson and his family, the Carters and other
contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and
ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a
marathon.
   The confetti fell, the balloons followed and the Democrats went
home happy.

   Two decades ago, John Mariotta worked with his
hands in his tool-and-die shop in the South Bronx, not far from
Yankee Stadium. He had two employees; he eked out a living.
   That was long ago, before the dollar signs multiplied and then
multiplied again, before President Reagan called him a hero of the
1980s, before his Welbilt Electronic Die Corp. became Wedtech.
   Now Mariotta's waiting for a jury to begin deliberations on
charges that he and five co-defendants, including Rep. Mario
Biaggi, turned the company into a racketeering enterprise that
dispensed millions in bribes to secure government contracts.
   ``It took me 20 years to build this company and you
intellectuals robbed my company from me,'' Mariotta said in federal
court.
   Mariotta, 58, is an illiterate who by dint of know-how and
enthusiasm turned Wedtech into a success story.
   ``My reading ability will go as far as a comic book is
concerned. Don't ask me to read the Times,'' he said.
   Mariotta's parents were natives of Puerto Rico and he was born
in Spanish Harlem. He dropped out of high school and joined the
military. Once out, he tried to start a business but it failed, as
did his next two businesses.
   But by all accounts he is very good with his hands, a mechanical
genius. And in 1970 he hooked up with Fred Neuberger, a mechanical
engineer.
   Together, they built Wedtech. With Mariotta as chairman and
chief executive officer the company expanded, obtaining Pentagon
contracts set aside for minority-owned companies on a no-bid basis.
   Wedtech hired welfare recipients, drug addicts, gang members.
Soviet emigres, Cambodian boat people, Indians, blacks and
Hispanics all were represented among the employees, and financial
analysts joked that the company had to hire translators and hold
its meetings at the United Nations.
   Mariotta fired the company with his can-do spirit. He spoke to
each new employee to infuse them with Wedtech's
up-by-your-bootstraps philosophy.
   When layoffs struck, he delivered groceries to the workers. An
employee with a sick parent in Puerto Rico would receive time off
and a ticket home.
   After Ronald Reagan visited the South Bronx during the 1980
campaign and promised to do more to revitalize the area, Mariotta
heard the call.
   He attended about a dozen meetings of Hispanic business leaders
in Washington and met with President Reagan at a session devoted to
finding ways to help poor neighborhoods.
   The contracts rolled in. Eventually, the company employed 1,500
people and did $100 million in business annually. Mariotta lived in
the exclusive Westchester community of Scarsdale.
   ``The president has pride in this firm,'' said Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., when he announced that Wedtech had won a $24.2
million Navy pontoon contract in April 1984. ``It has a heart. It
has a soul.''
   A month before, at a Republican dinner in Manhattan, Reagan
saluted Mariotta as ``a hero for the '80s.'' And the next year, an
agency of the U.S. Commerce Department named him minority
entrepreneur of the year.
   Then it all came apart. He was ousted as chairman and chief
executive director in February 1986. Wedtech eventually closed shop
and sought protection under bankruptcy statutes.
   Neuberger pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and larceny. Like
three other Wedtech officials who also pleaded guilty, he testified
against Mariotta, accusing him of participating in a
multimillion-dollar slush fund that siphoned off money from the
company.
   The prosecution says Biaggi, 70, a 10-term congressman, extorted
nearly $4 million in Wedtech stock in exchange for helping the
company. The defense maintains the stock was given to Biaggi's law
firm to settle unpaid legal fees owed by Wedtech.
   Mariotta argued that the company gave its stock to powerful
figures like Biaggi in gratitude for their help _ not as a quid pro
quo for contracts.
   Mariotta said that if there were any illegal activities, he was
kept in the dark by other executives, shielded by his own ignorance.
   ``My writing ability is nil. For 20 years, you could look at my
company's records, you will not find one letter or any
documentation or anything in my handwriting,'' he said. Bookkeeping
was left to the bookkeeper, he said.
   When prosecutors asserted that he knowingly broke the law, his
answers were emphatic and to the point:
   ``No ways, no how.''

<TEXT>
   Just before Michael Dukakis stepped onto the
convention podium for the most important moment of his political
life, longtime friend Paul Brountas gave him two words of final
advice: ``Go slowly.''
   He meant it. Despite a highly successful political career and
three terms as governor, Dukakis carried to the stage at the
conclusion of the Democratic National Convention a reputation for
stepping on good lines and doing better at reducing political
emotions than inspiring them.
   Brountas wanted his friend to avoid what he saw as a Dukakis
rhetorical pitfall of hurrying his speech, of talking so fast the
words carried no punch. His friend listened.
   ``He did it,'' Brountas said, still beaming with the enthusiasm
of the convention's final night as he headed out of Atlanta and
into the new Democratic campaign. ``He paced himself.''
   In so doing, Dukakis answered the doubters who questioned his
ability to move an audience and to reveal enough soul to lead a
political cause.
   While the display of soaring rhetoric and moving delivery may
prove short-lived, Dukakis achieved it on the night he most needed
it _ claiming the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Indeed, at his first campaign stop the next day in McAllen,
Texas, Dukakis seemed to revert to his sometimes bland and wooden
delivery.
   But Dukakis aides believe that in Atlanta last week they
achieved all they could have: a united convention, a supportive
Jesse Jackson, and a moving prime-time television hour in which the
candidate revealed himself to the nation.
   Brountas, the senior adviser and campaign chairman who has been
Dukakis' friend since their days at Harvard Law School, said the
candidate seemed a little surprised by the emotion evoked in the
convention hall and by his own success.
   ``He said, `I walked out there ... and it exploded.'
   ``You know, how many people get nominated for the presidency? I
don't think he quite knew what to expect,'' Brountas said.
   In fact, Dukakis' speech was a departure in style from the
moment he stepped into view. He walked slowly from side to side on
the stage, accepting the cheers by slowing raising one arm and then
the other. That modest wave was more expressive than Dukakis had
been all week.
   ``He threw his hands up _ you know Dukakis doesn't usually do
that,'' Brountas said. ``When he did that, the whole place
exploded.''
   Dukakis used many of the lines he has used since the campaign
began in Iowa, referring to his immigrant parents and invoking the
imagery of John F. Kennedy's election nearly three decades ago.
   But with the aid of speechwriters Ira Jackson and Bill Woodward,
he dressed up those references in newer phrasing and, in delivering
them, seemed to connect with his audience in a way that
communicated more emotion than before.
   ``Most of it was Michael Dukakis' language ... with better
cadence, better rhythm,'' Brountas said. His closing remarks _ a
reference to keynoter Ann Richards' granddaughter, to Jesse
Jackson's five children and to his own expected grandchild _ were
penned in by Dukakis himself after Tuesday night's speech by
Jackson, according to Brountas.
   A day later, he traveled to the convention hall and spent three
and a half hours checking out the podium and rehearsing before a
TelePrompTer in a private room that was a replica of the stage. He
stayed, practicing, for two hours more than he had scheduled.
   When his speech was over Thursday night, aides and observers
pronounced it as good as he had ever been. Dukakis had an
explanation for his adviser Brountas.
   ``He said the crowd does it to you once in a while,'' Brountas
said. ``He was sort of choked.''

   A moderate earthquake shook southwestern
Greece on Saturday, but there were no reports of injuries or damage.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the temblor occurred at
12:20 p.m. and measured 4.4 on the Richter scale. It was centered
112 miles southwest of Athens in the Kalamata region.
   ``We felt the quake, but nobody panicked,'' said a police
officer by telephone in Kalamata. ``We're used to earth tremors
now.''
   An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit Kalamata in
September 1986, leaving 20 dead and several thousand homeless. Many
residents of the picturesque coastal town are still living in
prefabricated homes.
   The police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
there were no reports of injuries or damage in Kalamata or the
surrounding villages.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in a populated area. A quake measuring 5 can cause
considerable damage.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today decried the
``midnight in America'' rhetoric of Democratic National Convention
speakers, saying the country is in far better shape than Democrats
would have people believe.
   ``Our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in
America. To hear them talk, you wouldn't think that America is in
the longest peacetime (economic) expansion in history,'' Reagan
said.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from Reagan's mountaintop
ranch near Santa Barbara, the president took note of the
just-concluded Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, saying
Americans should have been ``shaking your head'' at some of the
statements.
   It was Reagan's first public comment on the convention. On
Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater seized the latest
consumer price report as evidence of ``good news from a Republican
administration.''
   Showing frustration with statements Democrats made at their
convention, he told reporters the administration has given the
American people the longest peacetime business recovery on record.
   Fitzwater disputed Democratic assertions that the administration
for nearly eight years has worked principally to enrich those who
were already well off when President Reagan came into office in
1981.
   Reagan, who watched Michael Dukakis deliver his speech Thursday
night accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, said today
that ``growth and opportunity have been born again in America.''
   ``Listening to the rhetoric, you would never have guessed that
America's economy is the strongest in decades,'' the president
said. He did not mention Dukakis other any other Democrat by name.
   Reagan has been following the events in Georgia from his ranch,
where he has been vacationing for the past week.
   In his radio address a week ago, Reagan predicted that his
economic policies would come in for heavy criticism at the Atlanta
gathering and told his listeners the country is better off
economically than when he became president.
   Fitzwater cited the June Consumer Price Index as proof of a
stable economy. The report said inflation rose at a moderate annual
rate of 4.2 percent last month, and that for the first six months
of this year the pace was 4.4 percent, the same as in 1987.
   ``The data continued to show no significant acceleration of
inflation from the 4 percent range that has prevailed in recent
years,'' he said, ``more good news from a Republican administration
that's given you 68 straight months of economic recovery.''
   Fitzwater, a native of Abilene, Kan., a farming area, suggested
the administration needed to do more to tell its side of the
economic story, saying officials should ``quit hiding our bushel
here.''
   Asked if that meant he had adopted a strategy of using White
House news briefings to take on the Democrats, the spokesman
replied, ``No, although you've never seen me bashful to talk about
the glories of our economic recovery, have you?''
   Meanwhile, the White House announced that Reagan had started the
process of bringing trade sanctions against Brazil.
   Fitzwater announced that Reagan had invoked provisions of the
Trade Act of 1974 to punish Brazil for allegedly refusing to
provide adequate patent protection to U.S. pharmaceutical and
chemical products.
   He said the U.S. government will bring sanctions against $200
million worth of Brazilian imports, and there were indications
these punitive measures would come in the form of tariffs rather
than embargoes.
   The administration said it remained to be decided which
Brazilian products would be affected.
   ``Adequate patent protection is the cornerstone of a healthy
pharmaceutical industry,'' Fitzwater said in a statement. ``By
denying this basic commercial right, Brazil permits unauthorized
copying of pharmaceutical products and processes that were invented
by U.S. firms. This not only deprives American companies of sales,
it discourages investment in the research and development of new
drugs.''
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, has
maintained that Brazil's policy on patents has cost the industry up
to $150 billion in losses since 1979.
   An administration official, declining to be named publicly, said
it was likely the U.S. Trade Office would settle on a damage figure
of roughly $36 million a year since 1979, before public hearings
aimed at determining which Brazilian products would be included in
the trade sanctions.

   Billionaire philanthropist H. Ross Perot isn't
happy with developments at a local arboretum and botanical garden,
and he wants the park to give back his multimillion dollar donation.
   Perot donated $2 million and pledged $6 million in October 1986
for expansion and development of the park, which is run by the
Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Society.
   Voters approved $7.5 million in bonds to improve the 66-acre
park, but only $2.5 million has been issued and Perot said because
of the downturn in the economy he doubts enough public and private
money will be available to develop the arboretum into a world-class
facility.
   ``We can't afford to spend money on things like this now,''
Perot said. ``There are no villains. It's the economic period we're
going through now. We had a plan when we started. It went from
world-class to a scaled-back, nice arboretum.''
   Robert Hoffman, chairman of the society, said Perot's $2 million
had not been spent and that the society's board will meet Thursday
to decide on a response.
   If the arboretum board returns his money, Perot said he will
give the funds to people who need it.

   Doctors for Gov. Bill Clements, who
suffered a mild stroke last week, postponed his hospital release
Saturday after detecting a heart rhythm irregularity, the
governor's spokesman said.
   Dr. David Morris at Seton Medical Center described Clements as
``very stable overall,'' and he is listed in good condition at the
hospital, said Reggie Bashur, the governor's press secretary.
   Morris, a heart specialist, and Dr. Jerry Tindel, a neurologist,
earlier said tests indicated Clements' heartbeat irregularity could
have caused a tiny blood clot to form in his heart before passing
through his bloodstream and into his brain, causing the stroke
Monday night.
   The governor admitted himself to the hospital Tuesday evening.
He suffered some vision problems in his right eye, doctors said.

   Country singer Willie Nelson's support of
an American Indian convicted of killing two FBI agents has drawn
the ire of police, who are threatening to picket his concerts next
weekend.
   Owners of a theater where Nelson is scheduled to perform tried
to block the picketing, but Superior Court Judge Antonio S. Almeida
on Friday refused. The judge said he will consider a request by the
Warwick Musical Theater for stringent protest guidelines.
   Police from Rhode Island and other states are planning to picket
Nelson's concert to protest his support of Leonard Peltier.
   Peltier, 43, was convicted in 1977 and sentenced to two
consecutive life terms for killing the FBI agents during a gunfight
on a South Dakota reservation. He is currently serving his sentence
at a federal penitentiary in Kansas.
   Nelson held a concert last October to raise money for Peltier's
defense.
   Rodney Patterson, president of the Providence Fraternal Order of
Police and a picket organizer, said police have no intention of
protesting on private property. ``We're planning on acting like
professionals,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A nurse who says she suffered
excruciating pain and emotional distress after a doctor yanked her
ponytail has been awarded $65,000 in an out-of-court settlement.
   Jean Kovel said she was sitting at the nurse's station in
Memorial Hospital on Sept. 25, 1984, making notes in a patient's
chart, when someone pulled hard on her ponytail and said, ``Hey,
babe, what's going on?''
   ``My head jerked back so hard that the chair came up resting on
the back two wheels,'' she said. ``The pain was excruciating.''
   She said she turned around to find William Emeis, an
obstetrician-gynecologist, smiling at her.
   Emeis denies pulling Kovel's hair, but this week his insurance
company paid $65,000 to settle her lawsuit charging assault,
negligence and emotional distress.
   Kovel, 31, said this week that the pain in her neck, back and
shoulder never went away and has affected her life.
   ``I was off work for five weeks, lying in bed or undergoing
therapy every day. I had to wear a cervical collar, take pain
medication and muscle relaxants,'' she said.
   She said she had to hire a maid because she couldn't perform
some household chores, and had to give up her daily jog because of
her injury.
   ``I can't even bend down to hug my two children before they go
to sleep,'' she said.
   Kovel's attorney, Jack Beam, said Kovel didn't recall the
incident when he gave a deposition. A pre-trial statement filed on
the doctor's behavior suggested it was horseplay.
   Said Kovel: ``I don't know whether it was his way of greeting me
or if he wanted to rip my hair out. We hadn't had any
disagreement.''

<HEAD>Gloria Vanderbilt Under Doctor's Care Following Son's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heiress and designer Gloria Vanderbilt was under
a doctor's care Saturday following the suicide of her son, who
jumped to his death from a 14th-floor penthouse terrace,
authorities said.
   Carter V. Cooper, 23, left no note before jumping from his
mother's apartment Friday night, said police spokesman Officer
Peter O'Donnell.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, the ``poor little rich girl'' who became the
focus of a heated custody battle in the 1930s, was put under a
physician's care after witnessing the suicide, police said.
   Cooper's father was writer Wyatt Emory Cooper, Ms. Vanderbilt's
fourth husband. She hasn't remarried since Cooper died in 1978
during surgery for a heart ailment.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, 64, is the great-great-granddaughter of railroad
and shipping financier Cornelius Vanderbilt.
   Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Ms. Vanderbilt became
famous at age 10 as the ``poor little rich girl'' _ the object of a
sensational custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and
matriarchal aunt.
   After growing up with her aunt, Gertrude Whitney, she went to
Hollywood and dated celebrities such as actor Errol Flynn and
billionaire Howard Hughes.
   She married four times _ the first when she was only 17,
prompting her aunt to disinherit her. She and Wyatt Cooper, who wed
in 1963, had another son, Anderson.

   Democrats think they can lure more votes this
year out of the Cuban-American Republican stronghold, as some Miami
Cubans try to increase their conservative ethnic group's
involvement in a national Hispanic coalition.
   ``We see the Cuban community as an area of opportunity,' said
Jorge Haynes, a Mexican-American who has been an aide to Florida
House Speaker Jon Mills, D-Gainesville, and was spokesman here for
the National Hispanic Caucus.
   Haynes said efforts to increase Hispanics' political clout by
having Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and other Latins working
together foundered with election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.
   But the group held daily, well-attended meetings last week
during the Democratic National Convention, Haynes said.
   Coral Gables banker Luis Lauredo, a Cuban-American who was a
Carter administration aide, was selected as a co-chairman of the
group.
   Simon Ferro, the 34-year-old Cuban-born attorney who heads the
Dade County Democratic Party, said Cubans traditionally haven't
been active in national Hispanic groups.
   Their immigration story is different than those of the Puerto
Ricans and Mexicans. The Cubans fled a homeland, where they had a
comfortable standard of living, because of Communist takeover and
have made anti-Communist stands a major part of their politics.
   Ferro noted that in Dade, 97,000 Cubans are registered as
Republicans, compared to 23,000 Democrats. He said the figures
don't include second-generation Cuban-Americans who were born in
this country, and the younger Cubans are more likely to join the
Democrats and identify with other Hispanic groups.
   ``It's been frustrating, but it's getting better,'' Ferro said.
   He said Cubans have seen that despite tough rhetoric, President
Reagan's Cuba policies weren't particularly strong.
   Ferro said he would emphasize that the Democrats are closer to
the Cubans' true best interests.
   ``Every time that something good happened to us _ the doors were
opened, the air bridge from Cuba, the social programs that helped
us _ the Democrats were in office,'' Ferro said.
   ``Cuba remains a priority, but there are other issues that bind
us together,'' Ferro added.
   He said the Cubans, with their strong anti-Communist interests,
can still fit into the Democratic Party just as do Jews with their
strong stands on Israel and blacks with their anti-South Africa
interest.
   ``I think other Hispanic groups should defer to us on Cuba. I
see no contradiction with the Democratic Party condemning Cuba
within the framework of human rights, just as it condemns South
Africa,'' Ferro said.
   Campaign planners in the state for Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis say they won't concede the Cuban vote to
Vice President George Bush and probably will have Dukakis and vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen campaign among them. Both
nominees speak Spanish.
   Haynes, from Texas, said Bentsen's popularity with Hispanics in
Texas and his conservative stands might play well with Cubans.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he received 25 present to 35
percent of the Cuban vote in his 1986 election, after 1984
presidential nominee Walter Mondale got about 5 percent.
   ``I think there is the legitimate basis for a transition. I
don't think it's going to happen overnight,'' Graham said.
   Tommy Thomas, a Southern co-chairman for the Bush campaign and
former Florida Republican Party chairman, said there's little
chance Dukakis will pick up Cuban votes. Republicans will be
emphasizing his liberal positions and opposition to aiding
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``Our Cubans are going to be wholeheartedly for George Bush,''
Thomas said.

<TEXT>
   In 1984, at age 13, Evelyn
Lau was one of 12 winners in an essay contest who got to meet Pope
John Paul II. At 16, she had become a runaway supporting herself
and her drug habit with prostitution.
   ``I told myself this wasn't prostitution, it's just give and
take,'' Lau said. ``It was there, and I had about 25 cents in my
pocket, and I had an amazing capacity at first to just block it
out.''
   Then she realized that her writing was taking a back seat to
drugs.
   ``That totally destroyed me,'' said Lau.
   After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, she wound up in a
hospital a year ago. She decided to stop doing drugs and resume
writing.
   Now, at 17, she has a Canada Council grant for $13,000 (more
than $10,700 U.S.) for her writing and a contract with a Toronto
publisher for her first book, to be called ``Small Lives: The Diary
of a Street Kid.''
   She also has more dubious signs of success _ legal problems and
lawyer's fees, over which she has little control because she is now
a ward of the state.
   She left home because of friction with her parents, possibly the
reason social caseworkers decided not to return her to her parents.
And since she was a juvenile not with her family, Canadian law
required that she be made a ward of the state.
   She said officials in the Social Services Ministry have told her
they are not sure she can handle the grant, which comes out to
about $1,100 (more than $900 U.S.) a month. She is negotiating with
public trustee Steven Rumsey and the ministry superintendent over
how her grant should be paid.
   ``It's hard enough being a writer and not getting a paycheck
every two weeks, and the rewards are few and far between,'' Lau
said after she learned of the award last week. ``Then when you get
rewarded, they take it away from you.
   ``I felt like I was more of a human out there (on the street)
than I am now. At least I had some control.''
   ``I'm supposed to be jumping up and down, but I feel like every
time I do something that everybody should be happy about they have
an anxiety attack,'' she said. ``They're afraid I'm going to take
the money and blow it, which isn't even feasible.''
   ``If I went out and got a job that paid $1,100 a month, they
wouldn't come after me and say, `You're making too much money,' so
how is this different? Isn't this work?'' she said.
   ``We want to make sure the monies are used for the purposes
intended by the grant,'' Rumsey said Wednesday. ``We would be
responsible in looking after the funds as trustees.''
   Lau also receives $480 a month in social assistance. She pays
$300 for rent and uses the rest for writing expenses.
   ``When I get my check I buy my supplies first _ paper, ribbons,
stamps. I'm constantly submitting my short stories and poems to
magazines, and I'm not going to give that up, but it's amazing how
much it costs,'' Lau said.
   Her first encounter with the problems of being a ward of the
state came when the public trustee hired lawyer Bruce McColl to
review her contract with literary agent Denise Bukowski, her book
contract with Collins Publishers and her manuscript for any
potential libel.
   McColl's $175-an-hour fee is to be paid from Lau's advance on
royalties from Collins, although the size of the advance was not
known.
   Bukowski said the lawyer is unnecessary because the publisher
has its own lawyers to check the manuscript, butMcColl said he
redrafted the agent's contract, approved the publisher's contract.
   ``We have a responsibility to protect the child,'' Rumsey said.
``The publisher may well have counsel, but that doesn't necessarily
mean the best advice is going to go to the infant.''

   Rains and landslides were reported
across India on Saturday, and the death toll from the annual
monsoon rains rose to 255, reports said.
   The hill resort of Simla in the northern state of Himachal
Pradesh was cut off for the third day, the Press Trust of India
reported. Rail and road traffic to Simla, the state capital, has
been disrupted because of landslides and heavy rains.
   At least 20 more deaths were reported as a result of the rain,
which began last month. The rain, eagerly awaited by Indians after
three years of drought, has caused widespread flooding.
   In New Delhi, officials began evacuating people living in
low-lying areas near the Yamuna river.
   Warnings were issued to villagers living on the outskirts of the
capital because of the rising water levels of the river, the Press
Trust of India said.
   Five people died in Himachal Pradesh state in floods or
landslides, the United News of India reported.
   Eight more people were killed when heavy rains caused a mudslide
in northeastern Bombay, the news agency said.
   Three people died in Jammu district in Kashmir state when their
hut collapsed, and four people died in Uttar Pradesh state, UNI
said. Most of the deaths occurred in the past 24 hours.

<HEAD>Hungarian Leader, Seeking Closer Ties to West, Visits Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian leader Karoly Grosz, eager to
strengthen ties to the West as part of an ambitious reform program,
comes to Washington this week on the first visit by a Hungarian of
his rank since the country came under communist rule 40 years ago.
   Since becoming premier in June 1987, Grosz has moved decisively
to pursue economic and political openings to the West, where the
image of Hungary for years had been largely shaped by the Soviet
Army's smashing of an anti-Moscow uprising in 1956.
   Grosz's 11-day, U.S. visit, which began last week and took him
to Illinois, California and New York, has its high point Wednesday
when has a luncheon with President Reagan during a White House
visit.
   He also will meet with Secretary of State George Shultz,
congressional leaders and Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   Grosz, who became Communist Party general secretary last May in
addition to premier, is the first Warsaw Pact leader to make an
official visit to Washington since 1978 when President Carter
received Romanian leader Nicolai Ceaucescu.
   Grosz, 57, is from the same generation as Mikhail Gorbachev and,
like the Soviet leader, he has called for a new era of openness and
economic restructuring.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said that Grosz will be
encouraged during his talks here to continue his announced policy
of seeking increased trade with and investment from Western
countries.
   To improve efficiency, Grosz has been pushing market-oriented
approaches but this and other measures have increased unemployment
levels in Hungary. Another problem area for Grosz is Hungary's $11
billion foreign debt.
   Among economic goals approved by the party since Grosz'
accession are more foreign investment, fewer restrictions on the
ownership of foreign capital, an expansion of private initiatives,
and a greater voice for consumers.
   In Chicago last Wednesday, Grosz witnessed the signing of a $115
million joint venture between a Hungarian entity and Guardian
Industries Corp., an Illinois-based glass manufacturer.
   ``We have seen science and technology tear down borders between
countries and even continents ... and those who come to recognize
this will be in an advantageous position,'' said Grosz.
   Grosz also met with officials of MacDonald's Corp. to discuss a
larger presence in Hungary for the fast food giant. The firm
already has a thriving operation in Budapest.
   Grosz has been courting West European leaders as well. He was
received warmly on visits to Bonn and London and three weeks ago,
Hungary became the first communist country to reach an agreement
with the European Community.
   The accord will gradually allow expanded Hungarian exports to
Western Europe by removing present tariffs and quotas between now
and 1995.
   Still, Hungary is intent on maintaining its traditional role as
a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. More than three decades
after the Soviet invasion of Hungary, an estimated 65,000 Soviet
troops are deployed there.
   U.S. intelligence officials recently received indications that
the Soviets were planning to withdraw these forces but thus far
there has been no announcement.

   A large earthquake struck Saturday in
the southwest Pacific Ocean on Saturday, but there were no reports
of damage, officials said.
   The temblor struck at 1:17 a.m. Sunday local time (11:17 a.m.
EDT Saturday) and registered 6.8 on the Richter scale, said Pat
Jorgenson, of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   The quake was located about 150 miles northeast of Rabaul, New
Britain, off the northeast coast of New Guinea. No damage was
reported and no tidal wave warning was issued, Jorgenson said.
   The quake was reported by the National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., she said.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion and energy released by
a quake. The devastating 1906 quake in San Francisco, which took
place before the scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. on
the Richter scale.

   A criminal court judge kidnapped last week
was freed unharmed, but a friend abducted with him was tortured and
shot to death, police said Saturday.
   The abduction of the two men sparked a strike by Guatemala's
judges, clerks, lawyers and prosecutors.
   A National Police communique said Judge Sergio Anibal Trejo
Duque of the 7th Penal Court was kidnapped in Guatemala City along
with his friend, Carlos Moran Amaya, on Wednesday.
   Trejo Duque, 48, was set free Friday night, but his friend was
found dead earlier Friday, the communique said. It said Moran Amaya
was shot and his body showed signs of torture.
   When interviewed by reporters Saturday, Trejo Duque only said,
``They (the kidnappers) treated me well.'' He refused to say more
about his captivity.
   Members of the judiciary throughout the country stopped handling
cases in protest Friday morning. They called an end to the strike
Saturday after the National Police issued its communique.
   Trejo Duque's court has been handling a number of cases
involving members of the Treasury Police accused of robberies,
kidnappings and assassinations.

   A gas station owner who was enraged by the
town council's refusal to give him a car-wash permit shot and
killed the mayor of this northern Italian village and then
committed suicide, police said Saturday.
   Authorities said Marino Cotter, 58, shouted at Mayor Luigi
Rodigari during a town council meeting Friday night and left the
building only after officials threatened to call police.
   Colzate is a town of about 1,600 people, 50 miles north of Milan.
   After the meeting, Cotter, 58, approached the car in which the
46-year-old mayor was sitting in the parking lot, threw open the
door and fired 13 times with a pistol, police said.
   Cotter also shot the driver, Fernando Bonfanti, who heads the
local chapter of the Christian Democrat party, police said. He was
in serious condition.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address given from his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.:
   My fellow Americans, this week there was a certain meeting in
Atlanta, and maybe like me, you just couldn't help hearing a few
things about it and shaking your head. Some people just don't seem
to learn.
   The American people want to hear straight talk about where our
leaders plan to take the country, not personal attacks. For all our
history, we Americans have debated our differences vigorously. But
like two of the earliest political adversaries in our history _
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams _ while we've always fought hard
for our differing opinions, we've honored each other for taking
part in the democratic process.
   This week's convention speakers seemed to forget this American
tradition. But beyond that, there was something amazing about what
we heard. Our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in
America.
   To hear them talk, you would never have guessed that we're in
the longest peacetime economic expansion on record, that America
has created over 17 million jobs in the last five years, or that a
greater proportion of Americans in the work force has jobs today
than ever before in our history.
   You would never have guessed that after dropping by three
percent when their party was last in the White House, the real
income of the typical American family has grown by more than 10
percent since the current expansion began.
   You would never have guessed that our cuts in tax rates and
recent tax reform have done exactly what we said they would do _
Americans with the most income pay more of our total income taxes
than before. Many Americans at the bottom of the scale no longer
pay any income tax at all, and growth and opportunity have been
born again in America.
   Most of all, you would never have guessed how much our expansion
has meant to all Americans. For example, one respected economic
writer noted that for black Americans, the year 1982 to 1986
represented, in his words,``on every front, jobs, income, even
household wealth, the best five years in black history.''
   No, listening to the rhetoric, you'd never have guessed
America's economy is the strongest in decades. To them, it's
midnight in America. It's the same sad song they sang four years
ago.
   They say they want to turn America around. When their party left
the White House eight years ago, inflation was at one of the
highest levels in American history. Now, it's under control. Do
they want to turn that around?
   
   When they left office, America's industrial productivity was
stalled, our competitiveness was slipping, and technological
research, the key to our industrial future, appeared to be on hold.
   Today, manufacturing productivity is rising strongly _ some rate
us as the most competitive nation for manufacturing costs in the
industrial world, and we're again the world's leader in developing
new technology. Do they want to turn that around?
   And when their party turned over the keys to the White House,
the Soviet Union was going forward with the biggest arms build-up
in history. We were cutting back, and the Soviets had invaded
Afghanistan. Today, we have the first treaty in world history to
eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles. The
Soviets have pulled troops out of Afghanistan, and American-Soviet
relations are better than they've been for a good, long while. Do
they want to turn that around too?
   They said America can do better. With that, I wholeheartedly
agree. But the people also know that the last time our opponents
were in charge, America did a heck of a lot worse. What do your
opponents really want to do? Well again and again, we've heard from
the press that our opposition just won't say. We've heard that they
don't want to level with the country because when they've done that
in the past, the country hasn't liked what it's heard. So this
year, they've learned one lesson _ they're covering their tracks.
   You'll never hear that ``L'' word _ liberal _ from them. They've
put on political trenchcoats and dark glasses and slipped their
platform into a plain brown wrapper. But while they're saying that
government needs to do more of this or more of that, will they also
pledge not to raise taxes?
   While they're talking about reducing the danger of nuclear
weapons, will they also pledge to go forward full speed with our
Strategic Defense Initiative, the one practical way of reducing the
threat of those weapons once and for all? And while they're talking
about the war on drugs, will they also support the death penalty
for drug kingpins?
   The American people expect straight talk about real issues.
That's what they deserve and that's what they ought to get.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Honeymoon is Over, But Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Still
Optimistic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   M. Danny Wall, the nearly bald regulator of
the nation's savings institutions, is known as an optimist by the
comb he still carries.
   A year ago, Wall pushed hard for and was appointed to the
chairmanship of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, a job only a
cockeyed optimist would want at a time of unprecedented industry
losses and mounting S&L failures.
   To prove his credentials, he had only to pull out his pocket
comb and make a rueful reference to the few, wispy strands of hair
on the top of his head.
   Despite a year filled with criticism and difficulties, Wall said
in a recent interview, ``We haven't had any surprises'' and, asked
about his comb, he said smiling, ``I still have it.''
   The 48-year-old former Republican staff director of the Senate
Banking Committee enjoyed something of a honeymoon after he took
office last July, replacing Edwin J. Gray, an aloof administrator
disliked by his staff, the industry and Congress.
   A big part of Gray's problem was outside his control. His agency
was out of money and couldn't do much to stop the savings industry
from sliding into a morass.
   Wall came in with a number of pluses: a squeaky clean image, a
reputation for candor and enthusiasm and, most importantly, money
to work with. Congress last August provided for a $10.8 billion,
industry-financed infusion over three years into the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which guarantees deposits up to
$100,000 in 3,100 institutions.
   Now, the honeymoon is drawing to a close and there is no
shortage of critics. But even the critics acknowledge the bank
board's Herculean task. Insolvent institutions account for more
than 10 percent of the industry and losses in 1988 are expected to
top the $7.6 billion, post-Depression record of last year.
   ``I think he has the toughest job in the U.S. government and
everything has to be seen in that context,'' said Eric Hemel, a
former bank board, economist now an analyst for First Boston Corp.
   Earlier this month, the House Banking Committee put Wall through
a grueling session when he revealed he had more than doubled his
estimate of the cost of closing or merging insolvent S&Ls in Texas,
the state where the industry is sickest.
   In May, Wall was being criticized for being too optimistic by
insisting it was too soon to tell if his agency needed more money,
while private analysts were calling for a taxpayer bailout.
   Democrats were suggesting there were political motivations for
pushing debate over the problem into the next administration.
   Wall's refiguring less than two months later boosted the
pricetag for cleaning up the entire industry nationwide from $22.7
billion to $30.9 billion, more in line with the $26 billion to $36
billion estimate of the General Accounting Office and within range
of the $40 billion to $75 billion estimated by private analysts.
But he was still criticized for the change.
   ``Now you see it, now you don't,'' complained a frustrated Rep.
Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking
Committee.
   Wall, in the interview, said the new estimate was based on new
information, adding, ``We're trying to present a realistic view of
the problem. We're trying to keep everyone's fever in proper
perspective.''
   Despite the higher projected pricetag, Wall is still saying the
FSLIC could have enough money to handle the problem. But to do
that, he has had to offend another important constituency _
executives of the industry he regulates.
   Savings institutions were already disturbed by Wall's support of
legislation extending by one year the moratorium preventing them
from converting from FSLIC membership to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. The healthier FDIC insures deposits in commercial
banks, charging member institutions less than half of the
assessment charged by FSLIC.
   Industry executives objected when they found out Wall intended
to cover the cost of his his newly increased estimate of costs by
extending the special assessment thrift institutions are paying to
recapitalize FSLIC to 1998. Originally, it was scheduled to be
phased out by 1991.
   B.R. Beeksma, chairman of InterWest Savings Bank in Oak Harbor,
Wash., and vice chairman of the U.S. League, said the extension
would be misguided.
   ``What's necessary for this industry to survive in the long run
is the ability to attract new capital. ... Recently, the entire
profits of our business have been made available to solve the
problems of FSLIC. Yet we simply have to have profits because we
can't attract capital unless we have them,'' he said.
   Wall has also been criticized for moving too slowly in closing
or finding buyers for insolvent institutions in Texas, which alone
accounted for $3.5 billion of the industry's $3.8 billion loss in
the first three months of this year.
   ``It's just taking too long to get the deals done,'' said Bert
Ely, an Alexandria, Va., consultant. ``And by being so slow, they
are reducing the number of people who are even willing to look at a
deal.''
   ``We're critical of ourselves in that regard,'' Wall said, but
he pointed to three large transactions in the state in May and June
and promised the pace would pick up.
   Since money began flowing into FSLIC coffers in October, Wall
said his agency has closed, merged or otherwise resolved the
problems of 65 S&Ls.
   And, conservatively, he said the board would resolve the cases
of another 100 institutions by the end of this year, about one
third of the S&Ls considered insolvent under regulatory rules.
   ``If you had asked me about three months ago, I would have said
we're getting a lot of great promises, but not much action,'' said
James Butera, chief lobbyist of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, a trade group. ``But in the last three months, he has
really come through.''

<HEAD>Leader Resigns After 26 Years; Announces Referendum On One-Party
Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ne Win, who was blamed for leading Burma
into isolation and economic ruin during 26 years of authoritarian
rule, quit Saturday as chairman of the nation's only political
party and announced a referendum on one-party rule.
   Speaking to a special session of the ruling Burma Socialist
Program Party, the 77-year-old leader cited bloody anti-government
rioting in March and June as a main reason for his resignation.
   Five veteran party leaders, including the nation's president and
vice president _ less important positions than the party
chairmanship _ also resigned.
   ``Since I am indirectly responsible for the March and June
affairs and because of my adanced age, I am resigning from both
party chairmanship and also as a member,'' Ne Win told 1,000
delegates in remarks broadcast on state radio and television.
   ``Bloodshed in March and June showed the lack of trust and
confidence in the government,'' Ne Win said. ``To find out whether
the majority or the minority are behind (the demonstrators), a
referendum must be held so the people can choose between the
existing one-party system or a multi-party system.''
   He said the referendum would be held no later than the end of
September, until which the current government would continue its
functions.
   If a multi-party system is chosen, Ne Win said, general
elections must be held. Even if voters chose to retain a one-party
state, there should be ``necessary modifications,'' he said.
   ``Whatever the results of the referendum, and whatever the new
government, I will completely retire from politics,'' Ne Win said.
   The party congress was expected to choose a new chairman Monday.
Maung Maung Kha, prime minister since 1977, was seen as a likely
candidate.
   Since coming to power in a 1962 military coup, Ne Win led Burma
into isolation from the world community. The nation's economy
deteriorated, and political and personal freedoms were curtailed.
   Student-led demonstrations have rocked Rangoon and other Burmese
cities thre times since last October, resulting in deaths, mass
arrests and the closure of universities.
   Ne Win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far
more important party post. He was the most powerful figure in Burma.
   Authorities announced the convening of the three-day party
congress on July 7, two weeks after thousands of students and other
demonstrators battled riot police in the streets of the capital,
leaving at least nine people dead.
   A daytime curfew imposed on Rangoon following the rioting was
lifted, but violence spread to the cities of Prome and Taunggyi
last week and at least four people were reported killed.
   State radio disclosed last week that 41 people who were packed
into police vans during rioting in March suffocated on their way to
prison.
   Despite promises of economic liberalization, the government in
October withdrew three currency notes from circulation and offered
no compensation, triggering the first of the three major
anti-government protests.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon and other Western observers said
the outbursts after years of passivity reflected intense
disillusionment with the government.
   Regarded as potentially the richest nation in resources in
Southeast Asia, Burma has a per capita income of less than $200 and
ranks among the world's 10 poorest countries.
   Once the world's largest rice exporter and an oil producer,
Burma has suffered food shortages and has had to import petroleum
products.
   Although the state officially controls much of the economy, most
Burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in from Thailand, China
and Malaysia.
   Most foreign analysts and many Burmese blame Ne Win's rigid,
so-called ``Burmese Way to Socialism'' for these failures. The
``Way'' is an amalgam, forged during Ne Win's early years in power,
of a centralized economy, one-party military-backed rule, and
Buddhism.
   Probably as a result of Burma's colonial past, Ne Win also
sought to exclude foreign influence, including direct involvement
by private foreign companies. In recent years, tourists have been
allowed to enter the country, but only on seven-day visas.
   The five leaders who resigned wth Ne Win were San Yu, party vice
chairman and president of the country; Aye Ko, party
secretary-general and vice president; Sein Lwin, party joint
general secretary and secretary of the Council of State; Kyaw Htin,
party central executive committee mamber, deputy prime minister and
defense minister, and Tun Tin, central executive committee members,
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
   They are to retain their government positions until a new
government is formed.

   Iran said Iraqi forces today moved across
huge sections of Iranian territory and bombed targets with chemical
weapons.
   The fighting, reported by both countries, came as a U.N. team
prepared to travel to both nations to arrange a truce.
   Tehran radio urged all able-bodied Iranians to rush to the
front, saying troops were needed to ``thwart Iraq's new round of
mischiefs.''
   ``The General Command staff seriously wants all the trained
forces that are ready to go to the fronts to apply immediately to
resistance bases for rapid dispatch,'' the radio said in a report
monitored in Nicosia.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi Minister of Information Latif Nusayyib Jassem
reacted to the Iranian statement by saying Iraq had no desire to
occupy Iranian territory.
   ``All we want is to liberate our occupied areas... We have no
aggressive intentions against Iran,'' Jassem was quoted as saying
by the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi troops
had pushed across the border in the southern front and advanced to
within 24 miles of Ahwaz, capital of the Khuzestan province and 54
miles from the nearest border. It said hand-to-hand fighting was
continuing in the area.
   Iraqi troops were pushed back in the nearby Salamcheh region,
IRNA said, with the bodies of ``hundreds of Iraqi soldiers
scattered on the battlefield.''
   In the central sector, IRNA said that Iraqi warplanes dropped
chemical weapons on two villages between Sar-e Pol Zahab and
Gilan-e Gharb to the south, ``wounding a large number of
villagers.''
   In an earlier report, IRNA said Iranian forces repelled an Iraqi
attack at a southern border area west of the Iranian town of
Khorramshahron.
   ``The battle now continues between Iran's Moslem soldiers and
the invading Iraqis,'' IRNA said, adding that the Iraqis suffered
heavy casualties.
   IRNA said the Iranians used long-range artillery to bomb a
housing complex in Iraq's northern Sulimaniyeh province. The report
said three civilians were killed and four were wounded in the
attack Friday night.
   The news agency denied an Iranian report that Iran had shot down
an Iraqi jet fighter over the southern front.
   Both Iran and Iraw rarely let foreign observers near the
warfront and reports of fighting cannot be independently confirmed.
   On Friday, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, said the war with Iran was not over despite Iran's
acceptance Monday of a U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   ``My revolutionary children, you should not think that the war
has come to an end. Arm yourselves with the weapons of faith and
holy war,'' he said on Tehran Radio.
   Iraq said it regained on Friday the last remaining territory the
Iranians had captured in the eight-year war. Iran accused the
Iraqis of using chemical weapons.
   Both countries accepted an invitation by Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, to send their foreign
ministers to New York next week for meetings on implementing
Resolution 598, which the Security Council passed unanimously July
20, 1987.
   Iraq wants direct negotiations with Iran, and the Iranians
indicated Friday they may accept such talks if Perez de Cuellar
requests it.
   The Iraqis also said they would welcome a team Perez de Cuellar
is sending to arrange the details of a cease-fire. The nine
military officers and one civilian are due in Tehran on Sunday and
expect to be in the region about a week.
   A military communique read on Iraqi television Friday said: ``We
retook whatever was left of our land from the Iranians'' in an
offensive named ``In God We Trust 4.'' It said the victory ``will
acelerate the achievement of peace through the signing of a genuine
peace treaty via direct talks.''
   In the past few months Iraq has regained large areas that had
been captured by Iran, including the Faw Peninsula and marshlands
east of Basra, the Iraqi port.

   The drought is even beginning to interfere
with good clean fun.
   Officials of the annual Derby Days festival said the dry
conditions this summer made it difficult to find enough frogs to
compete in the 33rd Annual State Frog Jumping Contest this weekend.
   Last year 300 frog trainers ranging in age from 2 to 99 years
entered their leapers. But not everyone comes to the competition
with their own frog, so contest organizers sell locally raised
jumpers for $1.
   Jane Abbott, 76, a contest organizer, said marshes are dry this
year and there's been a dramatic decline in the frog population.
   ``Usually by this time of year we have lots of frogs hopping
around, croaking and just having a good time,'' Abbott said. ``But
not this year.''
   Contest organizers called local companies that use frogs for
research and asking them to donate competitors, Abbott said.
   ``The woman at one company said `We have some but they're all
bull frogs.' I told her, `I don't care what the frogs are full of,
I just want frogs,''' Abbott joked.
   Abbott, who has judged the competition for 33 years, said
participants have no shame about the way they go about trying to
win.
   Once a frog is put in the jumping circle and the timer is
ticking, owners often drop to their knees and coax, cajole, and
even sing ballads, trying to persuade their green athletes to jump,
she said.
   ``It is anything but dignified,'' she said. ``Frogs are funny,
you know. Sometimes they'll jump forward and then just turn around
and jump back again.''

   President Reagan on Saturday
proclaimed the week of July 24-30 as Lyme Disease Awareness Week.
   Reagan said in a statement that Lyme Disease afflicts ``a
growing number of Americans each year'' and has been identified in
more than 30 states.
   Lyme Disease, first identified by scientists in 1975, is spread
by the bite of a tiny deer tick.
   ``The best treatment for Lyme Disease is prevention,'' Reagan's
proclamation said. ``People must know the dangers associated with
ticks and take necessary precautions when hiking. They should check
regularly for the presence of ticks, know how to remove them and be
alert for symptoms of Lyme Disease.''

<HEAD>Man Charged In Death of Another Honeywell Co-worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was rehired by Honeywell Inc. after
serving four years in prison for strangling a co-worker has been
charged with killing another co-worker, a woman he allegedly
stalked and threatened for weeks.
   Randy Don Landin, who surrendered after the first slaying in
1979, turned himself in again Friday in the shotgun slaying of
Kathleen Nesser, saying ``he'd heard we'd been looking for him,''
said Sgt. Jeff McFarlane of suburban New Hope.
   Police had launched a search for Landin after Nesser, 25, was
slain early Tuesday outside her New Hope home, where she lived with
her 18-month-old daughter.
   Honeywell spokesman Tim Morin said he didn't know the specifics
of Landin's rehiring, but ``the philosophy we have is that we don't
discriminate when it comes to hiring practices.''
   Police had been trying to get the victim to file a complaint
about threats allegedly made by Landin. `If I knew then what I know
now, I guess we probably would have tried to move heaven and Earth
to prevent what happened,'' said McFarlane.
   Landin, 31, was charged with murder and jailed on $1 million
bail.
   In 1980, he pleaded guilty to murdering his girlfriend, Nancy
Miller. He was released from prison in 1984 after serving 4{ years
of an eight-year sentence reduced for good behavior and a year
spent in jail awaiting trial.
   Landin, who worked for Honeywell from 1977 to 1979, when he was
indicted in Miller's death, was rehired a few weeks after his
release.
   Police said Nesser befriended Landin at Honeywell's facility in
the suburb of St. Louis Park, where they were maintenance workers.
Landin told Nesser that Miller's death was an accident, police said.
   But Landin began stalking Nesser after she rebuffed his romantic
advances, harassing her with phone calls, police said. A death
threat note found on her locker about a month ago read ``One more
day dead,'' McFarlane said.
   St. Louis Park police found only Nesser's fingerprints on the
locker door, McFarlane said Saturday.
   Some residents of New Hope said Nesser ``was scared to death of
the man,'' who frequently visited her home. Neighbors said they
heard her phone ring unanswered for hours.
   On June 30, Nesser complained to her supervisor that she was
being harassed by another worker. On July 1, Honeywell officials
went to police with Nesser's concerns and six days later she was
reassigned to the company's Plymouth plant, McFarlane said.
   Nesser also changed her telephone number.
   Landin telephoned his supervisor on July 7 and resigned,
McFarlane said.
   McFarlane said police asked Nesser to make a statement about the
incidents so they could arrest Landin on charges of making
terroristic threats. She was scheduled to make the statement 10
days before she was killed but failed to show, he said.
   McFarlane, who talked to Nesser the Friday before her death,
said she ``was getting kind of complacent because there hadn't been
any threats for almost a week since she changed her phone number.''
   ``She got some breathing space after her transfer to Plymouth
and she felt that, if she charged him, it would make things worse
and she was feeling better,'' he said.
   On Monday, McFarlane said, St. Louis Park police told him they
had not heard from Nesser and had not been able to contact her
because her number had been changed.
   ``If you want to assess real blame, we're all guilty,'' he said.
``He was convicted, he got a sweet deal for no reason. He got out.
... Honeywell hired him back. This is just a whole series of errors
that culminated in a tragedy.''
   In a statement issued Friday through Honeywell, Nesser's mother,
Patricia Nesser, said: ``We are relieved that a suspect in Kathy's
murder is now in custody. I have no hate for him; it is not in me
to feel malice for him, at least not now.''

   No charges will be filed against a
woman who killed her husband after he threatened to shot the
couple's cocker spaniel, then started beating her when she
protested, police said.
   According to police, Ralph Hess Jr. said he was fed up with the
family's ``useless'' cocker spaniel and asked his wife, Katherine
Elaine Hess, ``Where's the gun?'' She refused to get it for him and
Hess turned on her.
   ``He then physically attacked her and knocked her to the floor,
kicking her and digging his fingernails into her arm as he was
kicking her,'' said George Pinckney, a police spokesman said.
   During the struggle late Thursday in a motel room, Mrs. Hess
reached under a nightstand, grabbed a small-caliber handgun and
shot her husband in the shoulder. Hess, 35, died a short time
later, police said.
   On Friday, the Pasco-Pinellas State Attorney's Office ruled that
Mrs. Hess acted in self-defense, said William Doniel, another
police spokesman.
   Pinckney said police closed the investigation and released Mrs.
Hess, 34.
   Police said the couple had come to Florida from Tennessee four
days before the shooting to open a business with another couple,
whom police would not identify.
   Motel manager Bob Carpenter said the Hesses were not guests at
the motel, but were visiting another couple who were staying there.
   ``After the shooting, I saw a cream-colored cocker spaniel
running around,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   St. Elizabeths Hospital wants to allow
presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to leave the mental
institution for a supervised recreational day trip with other
patients, a District of Columbia official said Saturday.
   The Secret Service, however, is opposing the proposed outing,
saying that the 33-year-old Hinckley remains a threat to President
Reagan and other federal officials that it protects.
   Hinckley was committed to the hospital in 1982 after he was
found innocent by reason of insanity in the March 30, 1981,
shooting of Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, a
Secret Service agent and a D.C. policeman.
   The proposed outing would, except for court appearances, be
Hinckley's first trip off the hospital grounds since Dec. 28, 1986,
when he received a 12-hour pass to have dinner with his parents.
Hospital staffers escorted him.
   Dr. Raymond Patterson, administrator of the forensic services
division of the D.C. Commission on Mental Health, said a review
board at St. Elizabeths has approved Hinckley's participation in an
outing to a museum, park or other public place.
   Patterson, who declined to say when or where the day trip might
occur, said that such outings are routine for St. Elizabeths
patients once physicians decide they are capable to participating
in such activities.
   ``These activities are considered therapeutic and allow
physicians to see how patients are able to handle themselves,''
Patterson said in a telephone interview.
   He said outings generally last from two to 12 hours and that
there is always at least one staff member for every five patients
on a trip.
   Federal prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge Barrington
Parker to hold a hearing on the proposed day trip. Parker, who
presided at Hinckley's trial, was not consulted about the 1986
pass, and hospital officials agreed to inform him in advance of
such activities.
   Patterson said that St. Elizabeths does not inform the courts
about impending day trips by other patients committed there as a
result of criminal proceedings.
   ``Mr. Hinckley will benefit therapeutically from participation
in this activity,'' the hospital said in a letter to Parker. ``It
has also been clinically determined that he can participate in this
activity without posing a danger to himself or to others.''
   Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams said the agency disagrees.
   ``We don't believe he should be released under any conditions,''
Adams said. ``We believe him to be a threat to our protectees and
will continue to believe that. There's nothing that's been shown to
us to indicate he's any different.''
   The last time St. Elizabeths sought permission for an
off-grounds activity for Hinckley was for an Easter 1987 visit with
his parents. The request was dropped after it was disclosed that
Hinckley had corresponded with Theodore Bundy, a convicted serial
killer.

<HEAD>Soviet Drug Addiction Rises As Alcoholism Drops, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper said Saturday that the number
of Soviet drug addicts soared from 1985 to 1987, while alcoholism
declined.
   The labor daily Trud said that in the two-year period, the
number of known alcoholics in the Soviet Union dropped by 17
percent.
   However, the newspaper said that in the same period, known cases
of drug addiction rose by 150 percent.
   It did not say exactly when the two-year period began, how many
drug addicts the country has or what kind of drugs were being used.
   The newspaper, which gave the figures in response to a reader's
question, based its report on information supplied by the State
Committee for Statistics.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev launched a tough
anti-drinking campaign in 1985 that included a reduction in vodka
production and stiff price increases for liquor. The newspaper did
not suggest a link between the increased drug problems and
Gorbachev's measures.
   The newspaper said alcoholism is most widespread in the Russian
republic _ which includes Moscow _ the Baltic republic of Latvia
and the southern republic of Moldavia. It said drug addiction is
particularly bad in the Ukraine and the Central Asian republic of
Turkmenia.

   Welcome Wagon International says an
off-color joke in the motion picture ``Big'' infringes on its
trademark and casts aspersions on its hostesses.
   The company, founded and based in Memphis, filed the federal
suit Friday against the producers and distributors of the film,
seeking an injunction against release of the movie for television
or videotape distribution.
   The action also seeks removal of the reference to Welcome Wagon
and payment of unspecified damages to the company.
   The film, which has already been released, stars Tom Hanks and
tells the story of a boy who gets his wish to become an adult.
   ``During (Hanks' character's) first day at work, one of his
co-workers points to a voluptuous woman who is dressed in red,''
the lawsuit says. The co-worker comments on the woman's sexual
prowess, saying, ``She is what we call the company `Welcome Wagon.'
''
   Welcome Wagon says in the lawsuit that its name is a trademark
and that the organization offers advertising to business sponsors
via gifts distributed by paid hostesses who visit people in their
homes.
   The reference in the movie conveys a false impression that a
typical Welcome Wagon hostess is promiscuous, the lawsuit says.
   Among the defendants are 20th Century Fox Film Corp.; American
Entertainment Partnership II, L.P.; Gracie Films and James L.
Brooks.
   Telephone messages for comment left Saturday at the offices of
20th Century Fox, Gracie Films and Brooks were not immediately
retuirned.

<HEAD>Bar Conference Recommends Sweeping Change In Gardianship Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RACINE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national conference sponsored by the
American Bar Association called Saturday for major changes in the
nation's guardianship system, including expanded legal rights and
representation for the old and disabled.
   Forty-four experts, including attorneys, psychiatrists, judges,
researchers and government officials, also cautioned that judges
and lawyers were often ``quantitatively and qualitatively
inadequate'' in performing their guardianship duties and
recommended greater awareness of flaws in the system.
   ABA officials attending the National Guardianship Symposium: A
Response to The Associated Press Inquiry said the meeting was a
result of growing concerns about the nation's guardianship system,
including the findings of the AP's 50-state investigation of abuses
in court-ordered guardianships.
   ``It's the perception of many professionals that the
guardianship system is not meeting the needs of some people and may
be abusing the rights of others, as demonstrated by the information
in the AP report,'' said Nancy Nevelowf Dubler, a commissioner with
that ABA's Commission on the Legal Problems of the Elderly.
   Last year's AP series found many of the 300,000 to 400,000
elderly under guardianship in this country are stripped of their
rights and placed under the power of a guardian without the same
court protections given those facing criminal charges.
   An AP review of 2,200 case files also found the courts often
failed to do their job monitoring guardianships, leaving elderly
wards prey to financial and physical abuse at the hands of their
guardians.
   The three-day conference issued 36 recommendations for change in
the system. Among them:
   _ Legal representation for all those facing guardianship. The
group said attorneys should represent the wishes of clients. The AP
investigation found lawyers often dismiss the rights of their
clients facing guardianship.
   _ The elimination of age, economic status, medical diagnosis or
``eccentricity'' as sole reasons for placing someone under
guardianship. While many state laws permit guardianships for
reasons of age alone, the conference stressed that guardianship be
used only when the person can no longer care of themselves.
   _ Greater efforts by judges, lawyers and court personnel to
understand the problems of the elderly. The courts were urged to
tailor proceedings for those with poor eyesight or hard of hearing.
   _ Attempts to find alternatives to guardianship in cases where
it does not serve the interests of the proposed ward. The AP study
found people are often placed under guardianship to assure payments
to nursing homes or limit liability to hospitals.
   David Wexler, a University of Arizona law professor and chairman
of the ABA's Commission on the Mentally Disabled said the
recommendations come at a time when the guardianship system is
coming under greater scrutiny.
   ``As the population ages and a larger number of people has
experience with this system it has to grow in importance,'' he said
   John Perry, commission director, said the recommendations would
go on to various ABA groups for review with hopes that state
legislatures and individual courts would amend laws and practices.
   ``It's one of the first volleys being fired in this issue,'' he
said.
   Since the AP's series last fall, some 20 states have either
passed or considered legislation to reform guardianship systems in
their courts.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., has drafted legislation setting
federal guardianship standards for the courts. Rep. Don Bonker,
D-Wash., also has drafted recommended standards for the system.
   The conference was sponsored by the ABA's Commission on the
Mentally Disabled and Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly
and was hosted by the Johnson Foundation.

<HEAD>Traditionalists Forming Group Loyal To Rome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of traditionalist priests and seminarians
have broken with renegade Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and are
setting up their own organization loyal to the papacy, according to
a Roman Catholic magazine.
   In an interview with the monthly 30 Giorni, Abbe Joseph Bisig
said 16 priests and 20 seminarians have joined the group and ``many
others'' are expected.
   The interview, to appear in the magazine's August issue, was
released to the media Saturday.
   Bisig, a former official in Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity in
Switzerland, said the new organization, called the Priestly
Fraternity of St. Peter, was being set up in Hauterive, Switzerland.
   Lefebvre, an 82-year-old Frenchman who heads an
ultra-traditionalist movement opposed to modernizing the Roman
Catholic Church, was excommunicated after he consecrated four
bishops without papal approval on June 30. The consecration led to
the first schism in the church in more than a century.
   The Vatican warned Lefebvre's followers that they also will be
excommunicated if they adhere to his movement. But Pope John Paul
II promised to meet their traditionalist needs, including wider use
of the 16th century Latin Mass, if they remained loyal to the
papacy.
   ``We want to be tied to the spiritual and liturgical tradition
in the church, thus with Peter,'' Bisig was quoted as saying. ``We
want to show our brothers that have created the rupture (with Rome)
that they can remain traditionalist Catholics within the church.''
   Bisig said he met with the pope and other Vatican officials in
Rome in early July to discuss the new traditionalist fraternity. He
said he was promised by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's
guardian of orthodoxy, that the group would receive official
Vatican recognition ``by September at the latest.''
   ``It is absolutely not our intention to fight with the St. Pius
X Fraternity,'' Bisig was quoted as saying. ``We are actually very
grateful for everything (Lefebvre) has done, apart from the schism.
He fought against progressivism and modernisn. That is also our
objective, but we want to do it within the church.''

   Kathy Foster, a third-year student at Tufts
University School of Medicine, was caring for a 10-year-old boy
with cancer last year when she noticed his depression over being
tutored while other youngsters were out playing.
   ``I thought, that's something medical students could do _ help
kids with their school work while they're at the hospital
undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster in an interview Saturday.
   Foster organized a group called Kids in Chemotherapy Support
(KICS) and passed out a questionnaire to other students to find out
how many might want to donate their time. She was amazed by the
response _ more than 75 Tufts medical students signed up.
   In order to link young cancer patients with medical students,
Foster contacted Dr. Lawrence Wolfe, assistant professor of
pediatrics at Tufts Medical School and chief of pediatric
hematology-oncology at the New England Medical Center. So far,
seven KICS students and patients have been matched.
   The program is similar to the Big Brother-Big Sister
organization. But the medical students help the children through
the kind of difficulties most kids fortunately don't face.
   ``The older kids are really concerned about their appearance,
such as hair loss or being too thin. Or their faces may be swollen
from steroids,'' said Foster.
   Students learn to help the kids cope with their problems
cautiously.
   ``You can't just come right out and ask them how they feel about
losing their hair,'' she said. ``But after playing a board game
with them four or five times, a lot of kids will confide in you and
say they're afraid of cancer.''
   Many children spend their eight hours of chemotherapy in the
hospital alone, with family or friends. Foster said she is helping
a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl who has Oriental cholangitis, a rare
gastrointestinal disorder. The girl lives with her grandmother and
other relatives, who attach a social stigman to her illness, Foster
said.
   Chris Aho, spokeswoman for the medical school, said school
officials were surprised at the number of students who signed up
for the program.
   ``Part of it is they're so anxious to be with patients,'' said
Aho. ``They want to help so much. They're looking for that
humanitarian aspect in people.''
   The students and the children often go on group outings. Last
spring, they attended a Red Sox baseball game at Fenway Park. The
highlight of the game, said Foster, wsa watching seven-year-old
Derek Walsh, a KICS child, enjoy the game.
   Walsh had a Wilms's tumor on his kidney but following surgery
and chemotherapy, he is cancer-free at this point. He was strong
enough to play baseball this spring.
   Foster said many of the students have formed close bonds with
their young friends and their families.
   ``When you are assigned to a child, you have that childthe whole
time they are undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster. ``Some
parents have even invited students over for dinner. The students
involved in these programs just love it. They wouldn't give it up
for anything.''

celebrations of his 70th birthday.
   Mandela's wife Winnie, their daughter, two grandchildren and an
American attorney who represents the Mandela family's interests
visited Mandela at Pollsmoor Prison for 80 minutes.
   Mandela also met with Yusuf and Amina Cachalia, activists who in
the 1950s waged with him a campaign against South Africa's policy
of apartheid, or racial segregation. The Cachalias last saw Mandela
in 1962, the year he was imprisoned. They had been applying for 15
years for permission to meet him again.
   Mandela is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the white-led government as a leader of the African
National Congress, the country's main guerrilla group.
   Mrs. Mandela said prison officials had the best intentions in
offering her husband a special meeting with nine of his relatives
on his birthday Monday. But she said Mandela rejected the offer to
protest the government's ban on celebrations of his birthday and to
protest the detention of pro-Mandela activists.
   Attorney Robert J. Brown, of High Point, N.C., said Mandela
agreed to grant power of attorney to him to protect the use of the
Mandela family name and its interests worldwide.
   Brown, who announced a similar agreement with Mrs. Mandela last
week, said the agreement requires that he consult with African
National Congress President Oliver Tambo in Lusaka, Zambia, on all
matters relating to the family.

   Ne Win, a one-time military hero and
Burma's undisputed ruler for 26 years, relinquished his grip on
power in a country shaken by mounting political unrest and economic
decline.
   Citing anti-government rioting and advancing age, Ne Win
announced Saturday he was resigning as chairman of the country's
sole political party, the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Ne Win, whose name means ``Brilliant as the Sun'' in Burmese,
called for a referendum on ending one-party rule that could shake
the very political foundations he established after seizing power
in a 1962 military coup.
   Born Shu Maung on May 14, 1911 in the central Burmese town of
Paungbe, he took the name Ne Win after entering revolutionary
politics in what was then a British colony.
   Ne Win worked briefly as a postal clerk after failing in medical
studies. He joined the anti-British movement and became one of
Burma's ``Thirty Comrades,'' who traveled secretly to Japan for
military training in the early days of World War II.
   Returning to Burma, Ne Win and his comrades fought first
alongside the Japanese against the British, but then turned against
their teachers after realizing that Japan would also colonize
rather than liberate the Burmese.
   Ne Win rose quickly in the military and became chief of staff of
the Burmese armed forces in 1949, the year after Burma gained
independence.
   He came to the political forefront in 1958 when the military
pushed aside an ineffective prime minister and established a
caretaker government in a country wracked by poverty and ethnic
division.
   As promised, elections were held in 1960. Nu, soon to become Ne
Win's archrival, won the post of prime minister. Ne Win, who had
the makings of a popular leader, staged a coup in 1962, jailed Nu
and vowed to lead his country on a neutralist, egalitarian and
moralistic ``Burmese Road to Socialism.''
   Once known as a playboy and gambler, Ne Win banned gambling,
closed nightclubs and preached strict, traditional morality. This
did not stop him from enjoying horse racing or from marrying six
times.
   He moved quickly toward socialism. Private businesses were
nationalized, generally with little or no compensation, and the
central government attempted to run everything from the vital rice
trade to light manufacturing.
   Foreign private investment ceased, and foreigners were carefully
screened before being allowed into the country. Some charged that
Burmese leaders, including Ne Win, could not shake a post-colonial
syndrome that included xenophobia.
   Ne Win became president under a constitution written in 1974.
   Although he retired from the military in 1972, Ne Win maintained
effective control of the capable, well-organized armed forces that
served as his chief instrument of control.
   When anti-government riots erupted from time to time, Ne Win
moved ruthlessly to suppress them. Thousands of dissenters were
jailed. Although most were later releaed, there have been
persistent allegations of human rights violations.
   Fearing assassination, Ne Win rarely appeared in public,
traveled under tight security and never gave a press conference. He
became a recluse and spent much of his time in a heavily-guarded
lakeside villa on the edge of Rangoon.
   About the only time Rangoon residents could catch a glimpse of
their leader was inside his heavily guarded limousine on the way to
play golf.
   He also kept potential rivals at bay, by firing or jailing
up-and-coming leaders and demanding loyalty from subordinates.
   Burmese say Ne Win is both a shrewd, calculating political
tactician and a personality given to sudden outbursts of anger.
   His moves were rarely foreshadowed.
   His resignation from the presidency in 1981 was unexpected, as
was Saturday's announcement that he would step down from his one
remaining post, the chairmanship of the party.
   He cited poor health on the first occasion and advancing age on
Saturday. There have been unconfirmed reports of heart, kidney and
stomach problems. But after 1981, Ne Win gave no indication that
declining health had lessened his grip on power.

   American tourists grumble about prices in Italy even
as they pitch coins into the Trevi Fountain. The symbolic gesture
is supposed to guarantee a return to Rome, but that is something
fewer Americans can afford to do.
   ``We've been traveling for a month and this is the most
expensive place we've been,'' said Caroline Faris of Wilson, N.C.
``Paris and Nice were cheaper, and that's surprising.''
   Italian tour operators aren't surprised. They say Italy is
pricing itself out of the market with exorbitant rates and inferior
service. The government predicts that compared to last year, U.S.
tourism will drop by more than 6 percent, or 112,000 people.
   Tourism from other countries is on the rise, and students and
backpackers from the United States still jam the streets of
Florence and the ferries in the Venice lagoon. The drop-off is
among the big spenders.
   ``We are one of the most expensive countries in the world for
hotels and restaurants. And this comes with a very low level of
service quality,'' said Isabella di Montezemolo, a spokeswoman for
American Express Travel Services here.
   ``Our country is very rich in natural and historical beauty, but
people are getting a bit tired of the services,'' she said. ``They
feel they are being taken for a ride.''
   ``Our tourist services are 30 years old. They are too old, too
small and not competitive anymore,'' said Enzo Poli, the president
of a federation of 2,700 Italian travel agents and tour operators.
   Giovanni Colombo, the president of the Federation of Italian
Hotels, said that compared to last year, the number of foreign
tourists in Italian hotels has increased by 5 percent. Ms. di
Montezmolo cited a 47 percent increase this year in Japanese
tourism due to a favorable exchange rate.
   But industry officials are concerned about the drop in the
number of Americans, who traditionally are among the biggest
spenders.
   ``This year Americans won't be the big spenders and they will
shorten their vacations in Italy,'' said Franco Cesaretti of the
Aviatur travel agency in Rome.
   Franco Paloscia, spokesman for the Italian National Tourist
Office, said his government spent about $9.2 million over the past
two years to promote Italy's image.
   His office predicts Americans will account for 6 percent of
foreign tourism this year and at least 10 percent of the revenue.
In 1985, Americans made up about 7 percent of the tourists and 17
percent of the revenue.
   That was before the rise of Middle East terrorism in Europe and
the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the Soviet
Union sent vacationing Americans elsewhere.
   The Italian tourism industry discounts the theory that recent
acts of terrorism in Europe, such as the killing of a U.S. diplomat
in Greece and an attack on a tourist ship there, are factors in the
declining number of U.S. tourists.
   ``Terrorism is not scaring American tourists anymore,'' said
Paloscia. ``Terrorism, pollution, strikes are problems which
tourists learn to live with.''
   Ms. di Montemezelo agreed, blaming instead the weak position of
the dollar.
   ``This is not connected to terrorism,'' she said. ``The decrease
is due mainly to the dollar. Bookings are done mainly in November,
and November was the lowest point reached by the dollar.''
   The dollar has rebounded from a value of 1,208 lire in November
to about 1,365 lire. But officials say that is not enough for
people to change their plans.
   ``Italy is extremely expensive, it is one of the most expensive
countries in the world,'' said Cesaretti of the Aviatur travel
agency. He said that in Rome, the average price of a night in a
first-class hotel is $184 to $220, while in Madrid it is $95 to
$110.
   An American Express spokeswoman in London, who asked not to be
identified, said a 14-day holiday in Spain at a three-star hotel
with breakfasts, some dinners and sightseeing tours would cost $965
while a comparable tour in Italy would cost $1,495.

   President Zia ul-Haq on Saturday
accused the Soviet Union of sending thousands of troops back into
Afghanistan to defend the capital of Kabul, but Moscow called it a
``sheer lie'' and said its pullout is continuing.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported meanwhile that
Afghan rebels fired six rockets into residential areas of Kabul
Saturday, killing two people, including a 3-year-old girl. Tass
said six people were wounded and several homes destroyed in the
third rocket attack on Kabul in a week.
   Zia, the Pakistani army chief of staff, said the Soviets
``decided not only to stop their withdrawal but they have also
brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the Soviet Union
into Kabul because Kabul was under threat.''
   Zia, speaking at a news conference, refused to reveal the source
of his information other than to say it came from a ``very reliable
source.''
   The Soviets agreed in April to withdraw more than 100,000 troops
backing the Kabul government in its war with U.S.-backed Moslem
guerrillas.
   In Moscow, Tass quoted Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of
staff, as saying the pullout continues. He described the claims of
bringing in 10,000 troops as a ``sheer lie.''
   The U.S. State Department said there were ``conflicting reports
about a possible reintroduction of Soviet troops in Afghanistan''
and cited Akhromeyev's statement Saturday that the withdrawal is
still in progress.
   ``The Geneva Accords are clear that the Soviets are to have half
their forces out by Aug. 15 and the rest by Feb. 15, 1989. We
expect them to comply with this obligation and their commitment to
us,'' said the State Department statement made available Saturday
at the White House press office in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   Earlier last week, Western diplomatic sources claimed Soviet
troops were taking the lead in the defense of Kabul after a series
of guerrilla attacks.
   Diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said
unconfirmed reports from usually reliable sources claim 4,000
guerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and
fighting is reported tense on all fronts.
   Rockets blasted the city Tuesday and Wednesday. Official Radio
Kabul said 15 people were killed Tuesday, and diplomats put the
toll at 17. Casualty figures for Wednesday's attack were not
available.
   On Friday, rebels shelled the Afghan city of Jalalabad, killing
a woman, a child and two other people, according to Tass. The news
agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart, Bakhtar, said nine people
were wounded in the attack.
   Tass quoted the Afghan president, Najib, as calling in a
televised speech Saturday for an end to the ``bloodshed and
fractracide.'' The agency said Najib blamed Pakistan, a guerrilla
ally, for the increase in attacks.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
government fight the guerrillas. In the U.N.-brokered Geneva
agreement signed in April, the Kremlin agreed in April to withdraw
its troops but the rebels, who did not sign the agreement, vowed to
fight on.
   Zia denied Pakistan has violated the Geneva accords. The Afghan
government has lodged almost 55 complaints with a U.N monitoring
team, accusing Pakistan of harboring guerrillas, supplying them
with weapons and allowing a resistance government to establish
itself on Pakistani soil.

<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton and family
saw the value of their stock lose more than $135 million last year
but they remained the wealthiest people in the United States, U.S.
News says.
   The Waltons of Bentonville, Ark., whose stores are fixtures in
small-town America, held $6.13 billion worth of stock in Wal-Mart,
keeping them atop the magazine's Richest 100 list for the third
time since the rankings began three years ago, U.S. News said in
its Aug. 1 editions.
   To make the list, an individual or family must own at least 5
percent of the shares of a publicly traded company. This is the
level the government considers large enough to influence management.
   In second spot again were Irenee and Edward du Pont and family
of Wilmington, Del., with $3.38 billion worth of the giant chemical
firm. U.S. News said the du Ponts kept the ranking despite a $1.3
billion loss in stock value in the year ending last March.
   David Packard, the computer pioneer from Los Altos Hills,
Calif., jumped from seventh spot in 1987 to third this year, with
$2.56 billion worth of holdings in Hewlett-Packard Co.
   No. 4 in the latest list were Carl Lindner and family of
Cincinnati, with $2.3 billion worth of holdings in food, financial
services, retailing and electronics firms. The Lindners were not in
the Top 10 last year.
   In fifth spot, up one from 1987, were John Dorrance Jr. and
family of Gladwyne, Pa., with $2.05 billion worth of the Campbell
Soup Co.
   Others in the Top 10 were Edgar and Charles Bronfman and family
of New York and Montreal, Seagram Co. Ltd., $1.88 billion; Sid,
Lee, Robert and Edward Bass of Ft. Worth, Texas, a variety of
holdings, $1.75 billion; Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb., Berkshire
Hathaway, $1.64 billion; William Ford and family of Grosse Point
Shores, Mich., Ford Motor Co., $1.62 billion; and the Bancroft
family of New York, Dow Jones & Co., $1.61 billion.
   U.S. News said the Bancrofts fell from third position in 1987
because of a $1.19 billion loss in stock value last year. It said
other stock-value losses included $859 million for the Bronfmans,
$510 million for the Dorrances and $320 million for the Lindners.
   U.S. News said the year's biggest money loser was Leslie Wexner
of Columbus Ohio, whose holdings in The Limited clothing stores
fell in value by $1.4 billion, or nearly 55 percent. Wexner was
ranked 17th among 18 billionaires on the list.

   Danbury, Conn., tops this year's Money magazine
survey of the 300 best areas in America to live, edging out last
year's winner, Nashua, N.H.
   Danbury moved from fifth place to the top of the list because of
a lower crime rate, slightly better schools and its proximity to
New York City's museums, theaters and top-flight hospitals, Money
said in its August issue.
   Danbury, with 60,470 residents, is about 55 miles northeast of
New York.
   ``I think it's great. It makes us feel good,'' said Robert D.
Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide Corp., which is headquartered in
Danbury.
   But a shopper on Danbury's Main Street questioned the ranking.
   ``I don't know why,'' said the woman, who identified herself
only as Barbara. ``It's boring. When we want to do something, we go
into the (New York) city.''
   The rating also was questioned in Atlantic City, which came in
last.
   ``It's almost a laughing matter to me,'' said Mayor James Usry.
``I think some of the data or statistics or research they used is
faulty. I have made my home here and I'm proud of the progress
being made here.''
   New York City was rated 19th, up from 82nd last year.
   ``Naturally, we would still think it's too low _ because we
think it's No. 1,'' said Rose Marie Conors, spokeswoman for Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
   In order, the top 10 regions are Danbury; central New Jersey;
Norwalk, Conn.; New York's Long Island; San Francisco; Nashua; Los
Angeles-Long Beach; California's Orange County; Boston; Bergen and
Passaic counties in New Jersey.
   ``Being top dog is always preferable to sixth place, but we
don't feel too bad nestled between San Francisco and L.A.,'' said
Michael Valuk, executive director of the New Hampshire Association
of Commerce & Industry, which includes the Nashua Chamber of
Commerce.
   The ``streaking stars'' included midwestern cities with growing
economies _ such as Cleveland, up from 83 last year to 22, and
Cincinnati, up from 104 to 31.
   Flint, Mich., inched up from the bottom of the list to 293.
Flint residents were ``pretty steamed up'' about last year's survey
_ some even burned copies of the magazine, noted Managing Editor
Landon Y. Jones.
   Areas that plummeted this year tended to be relatively
crime-free and inexpensive towns plagued by weak economies, such as
Houma-Thibodaux, La., down from 11 last year to 128;
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Pa., down from 9 to 114; and Wheeling,
W.Va., down from 3 to 45.
   ``I don't think it's (the economy) any weaker than when we were
named No. 3,'' said Wheeling Mayor Tom Baller. ``I don't know how
they come up with these figures.''
   Money staffers sifted through government and private data on the
nation's largest metropolitan statistical areas, ranking their
crime, housing, health, economy, arts, education, transit, weather
and leisure activities. They visited the top and bottom 10 regions.
   Even top-rated Danbury had its drawbacks. A three-bedroom house
there typically costs $175,000 or more _ not unusual, considering
each of the top 10 area scored poorly in the housing price category.
   By contrast, the Atlantic City area _ No. 300 this year _ ``has
a marvelous, five-mile stretch of boardwalk beachfront, stately
houses in surrounding towns and an outstanding public library,''
the magazine said.
   The ``Bottom 10'' among the 300 are Des Moines; Rockford, Ill.;
Flint; New Bedford, Mass.; Janesville-Beloit, Wis.; Battle Creek,
Mich.; Yuba City, Calif.; Benton Harbor, Mich.; Jackson, Mich.; and
Atlantic City.

<HEAD>Search For Marcos' Wealth Hampered By Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The resignation of a top official,
charges of corruption and internal squabbling are hampering efforts
to recover billions of dollars that Ferdinand Marcos allegedly
stole during his 20 years in office.
   There are even calls for scuttling the Presidential Commission
on Good Government, or PCGG, which President Corazon Aquino created
two years ago to recover up to $10 billion in assets that Marcos
and his associates are accused of taking.
   The commission is fighting for control of bank accounts, stock
and real estate scattered throughout the United States, Europe and
Asia, including about $350 million in New York real estate.
   But so far, the commission says it has gained control of only
$300 million in various assets in the Philippines. All but $60
million worth are subject to lengthy litigation.
   One commission member, Jose Laureta, told reporters that at the
current pace, it might take 100 years to retrieve the money ``if
we're lucky.''
   ``If we're unlucky, 300 years,'' he added.
   ``Only Marcos and (his wife Imelda) are laughing ...,'' wrote
columnist Vicente Albano Pacis in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
``The present difficulties of the PCGG must have been the first
good news the Marcoses have received since they arrived in Hawaii.''
   The Marcoses have lived in exile there since his ouster from the
presidency in February 1986.
   The crisis in the five-member commission reached a climax
Tuesday when Mrs. Aquino announced the resignation of its chairman,
Ramon Diaz.
   Diaz, a former insurance executive with an untarnished
reputation for personal honesty, quit in disgust after
Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez accused the commission of
incompetence and a ``trail of corruption.''
   Chavez made his accusation in the wake of a graft charge against
commission member Quintin Doromal, who allegedly used his influence
to win a government contract for a firm owned by his family.
   Doromal, who denied the charge, is to be arraigned before an
anti-graft court early next month.
   Diaz said in a letter to his staff that he resented being
``toyed around.'' He also claimed that relatives of unnamed
``powers that be'' interfered with the commission to free assets
seized by the commission.
   Diaz's replacement, Adolfo Azcuna, already has come under fire
because he was a partner in a law firm once retained by Benjamin
Romualdez, younger brother of Marcos' wife, Imelda, and former
ambassador to the United States during his brother-in-law's
administration.
   Romualdez's assets were among those seized by the commission.
   Following Diaz's resignation, Mrs. Aquino ordered an audit of
all assets taken over by the commission. They range from
businesses, stock, real estate, bank deposits, planes, automobiles
and jewelry. Some of the last three have allegedly disappeared.
   Members of the House of Representatives have called for a
separate probe. Speaker Ramon Mitra said the House is to debate
several bills calling for scuttling the commission or curbing its
powers.
   The commission has long been accused of corruption in the
handling of companies or shares of stock seized on suspicion they
were illegally acquired by the Marcoses or their associates.
   The commission was responsible not only for tracking down and
identifying companies controlled by Marcos and his associates but
also with administering them. Critics say that has given corrupt
officials the opportunity to rake off corporate funds.
   Commission officials have acknowledged corruption among some of
the commission's 200 ``fiscal agents'' and have filed charges
against six of them. In one case, members of a company board of
directors appointed by the commission allegedly voted themselves
car loans using corporate funds. Another case involves the
disappearance of hundreds of head of cattle from a sequestered
ranch.
   The current crisis complicates what was already an awesome task
of unraveling a web of dummy companies, laundered funds and aliases
allegedly used by Marcos and his associates to loot the treasury.
   Newspaper columnist Belinda Cunanan described the corruption
charges against the commission as exaggerated. But she acknowledged
its reputation had been so tarnished it deserves a ``mercy
killing.''
   ``Motives aside, I think Congress should really abolish the PCGG
at this stage,'' Mrs. Cunanan said. ``The exit of Ramon Diaz and
his replacement, even on a temporary capacity, by presidential
legal adviser Adolfo Azcuna ... just about shattered whatever
credibility is left of the PCGG.''

   Iran said Iraqi troops backed by tanks,
warplanes and chemical weapons pushed nearly 40 miles across the
border Saturday and it called on all able-bodied fighters to rush
to the front.
   Iraq said its aim was to capture a large number of prisoners
before cease-fire talks in New York. It said it had no intention of
keeping Iranian territory.
   A later report from the Iraqi News Agency said the Iraqi forces
``began withdrawing from freshly captured Iranian territory after
moving captured Iranian war equipment and prisoners behind the
lines.''
   It gave no figures on the number of prisoners taken or
casualties but said the Iraqis attacked a military camp in Hamid
and ``inflicted huge losses in men and equipment.''
   The agency said other Iraqi forces in Iran also would withdraw
after achieving similar objectives.
   The reports of fighting came as U.N. teams prepared to visit the
warring nations to work out implementation of a cease-fire in the
nearly 8-year-old war. The military observers were expected to
arrive in Tehran, the Iranian capital, Sunday.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said
Iraqi troops crossed into southern Iran and headed toward the oil
city of Ahvaz. IRNA said Iranian forces blocked another Iraqi
advance 15 miles to the west.
   The heaviest battles were around the towns of Hamid, Jofair and
Khushk west of Ahvaz, as well as Shalamcheh a little farther north
and the northern suburbs of the Iranian port city of Khorramshahr,
IRNA said.
   Iranian television broke into its regular newscast to announce
that ``our Moslem combatants forced the Iraqi forces to retreat''
from those towns.
   IRNA said Iraqi troops had been pushed back in the Shalamcheh
region, with the bodies of ``hundreds of Iraqi soldiers scattered
on the battlefield.''
   It said the tank-led ``Iraqi invasion'' was backed by heavy
artillery fire, chemical weapons, jet fighters and helicopter
gunships and was aimed at occupying Khorramshahr and Ahvaz.
   The Iranian dispatch said 5,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed or
wounded and 200 tanks or armored personnel carriers were captured.
   IRNA said the town of Gilan-e Gharb, 20 miles inside Iran and
about 110 miles northeast of Baghdad, fell to Iraqi troops who used
chemical weapons.
   ``The aggressors also captured Sar-e Pol Zahab garrison using
the same dastardly tactic,'' the agency said.
   The towns are in a disputed border area claimed by Iraq under
the terms of a 1975 agreement with Iran.
   ``All we want is to liberate our occupied areas,'' Iraqi
Information Minister Latif Jassem was quoted as saying. ``We have
no aggressive intentions against Iran.''
   Jassem, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said Iraq also aimed to
take as many Iranian prisoners as possible ``to facilitate the
achievement of a lasting and comprehensive peace.''
   There were no Iraqi comments on the Iranian claims that it used
chemical weapons in the fighting. Iraq has in the past admitted
using the outlawed weapons but said Iran used them first. Iran
denied that.
   President Saddam Hussein has said the capture of a large number
of Iranians would help in negotiations on a cease-fire based on
U.N. Security Council Resolution 598. Iran announced last week that
it was accepting the resolution, adopted one year ago.
   On Friday, both countries accepted an invitation by Javier Perez
de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, to send their foreign
ministers to New York this week for meetings on the resolution,
which provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders,
a prisoner exchange and peace talks.
   The resolution also calls for an investigation of which side
started the war.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Saturday that Iraq captured 8,635
prisoners in fighting Friday. According to figures released last
week by the International Red Cross, Iraq holds about 13,000
Iranian prisoners while Iran holds about 50,000 Iraqis.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, interrupted its regular
programming to urge all able-bodied Iranians to rush to the front.
   ``Oh proud nation of Iran ... make haste to courageously
confront the savage onslaught of the enemy. Turn towards the
fronts,'' the radio said.
   IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers flew 25 missions Saturday
morning, heavily bombing Iraqi positions in the southern and
central areas.
   It said an Iraqi jet fighter was hit by anti-aircraft fire over
the southern front and ``the aircraft disintegrated in the air.''
Iraq denied one of its aircraft had been shot down.

   The rupture and explosion of two underground
gas pipelines forced the temporary evacuation of 200 people and and
left a crater 30 feet in diameter and 25 feet deep in a highway,
authorities said Saturday.
   No injuries resulted from the Friday evening blast, which sent
flames up to 300 feet in the air, said Shawnee County Sheriff's
Deputy Richard Denton.
   The residents of an apartment complex and trailer court were
allowed to return to their undamaged homes after the fire was
extinguished about 1 a.m. Saturday, Denton said.
   The explosion blasted a crater into the northbound lanes of U.S.
75 near Topeka, he said.
   One pipeline carried methane and the other propane.
   Officials of Tulsa, Okla.-based Mid America Petroleum Co., the
pipelines' owner, met with city officials and emergency personnel
Saturday to determine the cause of the rupture and the extent of
damage, Benton said.
   Firefighters initially could not approach the ruptured lines
because of the heat. They extinguished nearby field fires ignited
by the explosion.

<HEAD>Jackson Leaves Atlanta, Says Convention Was `Tremendous Moment'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson headed home to Chicago
Saturday, leaving town in a decidedly more low-key manner than he
entered and maintaining that his failed presidential campaign made
history at the Democratic National Convention.
   The civil rights leader refused to speculate on whether he would
seek public office again, saying that his priority now is to work
for the Democratic ticket in the fall presidential race.
   ``My focus now is on the fall campaign,'' he told reporters as
he left a downtown Atlanta hotel. ``We'll be spending a lot of time
organizing for voter registration, issue interpretation, involving
people _ many for the first time _ and a big turnout for the fall
campaign.''
   Of his post-election plans, Jackson said, ``We'll have to
determine what will happen, based on the outcome of the campaign.
But we take this journey one phase at a time.''
   Jackson took members of his family, campaign staffers and
journalists who covered his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination to Paschal's, a well-known, black-owned hotel and
restaurant for lunch.
   The entourage then headed for Fulton County Airport, west of
Atlanta, where a chartered jet took off shortly after 2 p.m.
   Jackson, dressed in cuffed blue jeans, sandals and a red, white
and blue shirt, appeared at ease, accepting well-wishers and posing
for photographers. A few reporters and photographers covered his
departure and about 10 people gathered at the airport to bid
Jackson farewell.
   The casual scene contrasted sharply with the thunderous entrance
to Atlanta made by Jackson one week earlier.
   A motorcade of buses brought the Jackson campaign to Atlanta
July 16, two days before the start of the Democratic convention. He
addressed thousands of cheering supporters in Piedmont Park,
asserting that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, then assured of
the nomination, must give Jackson a stronger voice in the party.
   Dukakis, Jackson and vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas met on Monday and peace was made. Though Jackson's
name was placed in nomination at the convention, he later pledged
support for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Jackson said Saturday his campaign made great gains in Atlanta.
   He said blacks and others previously outside the party
mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall
campaign. And he noted that several Jackson platform positions were
adopted.
   ``We can leave Atlanta with a real sense of inspiration because
of the expansion of the Democratic Party, more inclusion,
involvement in the campaign at all levels, vertically and
horizontally. And also helping to determine the course, the
priorities _ being in the room where poilicy is debated and
priorities are set.
   ``This is a trmemendous moment for us,'' he said.

   Retired naval architect Charles Petzold and
a ship he helped design 44 years ago will soon be neighbors.
   A Navy demolition team will send the U.S.S. Rankin to the sea
floor off the coast of Martin County on Sunday to serve as an
artificial reef. The site is just a few miles from Petzold's home.
   ``It's crazy. It really is crazy. I can't believe how that thing
is following me,'' Petzold said.
   Petzold, a Stuart resident for 10 years, designed the ship with
colleagues at Gibbs and Cox Naval Architects in 1944 and followed
its career through World War II, when he was a civilian in charge
of monitoring ship performance during battle.
   After the war, his decision to keep the ship in the Navy fleet
enabled the vessel to build up a military record that includes
service in the Korean conflict and during the Cuban missile crisis.
   ``Here in the twilight of my life, that baby doll is going to be
right out there,'' he said.
   To add to the coincidence, his father-in-law, William McDonald,
was the Rankin's first full-time captain.

   A 6-year-old boy has his own theory on
the extinction of dinosaurs. ``My theory is that God killed off all
the dinosaurs so there would be room for all the other animals,''
says Andrew Shuster.
   Andrew, of Fremont, Neb., shared his theory with millions of
television viewers during an appearance Friday on the ``Tonight
Show with Johnny Carson.''
   ``That's not a bad theory,'' Carson said. ``It's as good as any
other.''
   Andrew was invited to appear on the show after its producers
heard of his 35-minute lecture on dinosaurs to second-grade
students in Fremont.
   Carson, a native of Norfolk, Neb., asked Andrew if he knew
Carson hailed from the Cornhusker State ``about 150 miles'' from
Fremont.
   ``Everybody who knows I'm going here tells me that,'' Andrew
said, seemingly unimpressed.
   The young dinosaur expert said he normally is not allowed to
stay up late enough to watch the show, but was given special
permission when he found out he would be a guest.
   Andrew said he likes the Tyrannosaurus Rex best of all dinosaurs
``because he was the king of the reptiles. He ate meat. He was
29-feet long.''

<DATELINE>PANCEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 10,000 Serbs rallied
Saturday to demand constitutional changes that would give Serbia,
Yugoslavia's largest republic, more control, Belgrade radio and
witnesses said.
   The rally in Pancevo backed Serbia's communist leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, who wants the republic to be given greater authority
over two of its provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   Those two provinces were granted wide autonomy by the Yugoslav
Constitution adopted under the late President Josip Broz Tito.
   The demonstrators, most Vojvodina Serbs, had expected to be
joined by Serbs from Kosovo for the rally in Pancevo, a Vojvodina
town 12 miles northeast of Belgrade.
   Belgrade radio said the Kosovo Serbs decided against attending
the demonstration to comply with a call by the Yugoslav Communist
Party presidium Wednesday for an end to the protest rallies.
   Two weeks ago Kosovo Serbs held a rally in Vojvodina's capital
of Novi Sad but received little support from Vojvodina Serbs.
   Vojvodina's leadership last week claimed Milosevic was behind
the Novi Sad demonstration.
   The state news agency Tanjug said the rally in Pancevo ended
peacefully.
   Tanjug said about 30 Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo who did
come to Pancevo met with local officials and organizations.
   It quoted Pancevo Mayor Radomir Dangubic as saying the town
supported the demands made by the Kosovo Serbs.
   About 90 percent of the population in Kosovo are ethnic
Albanians and some 25 percent of Vojvodina's inhabitants are ethnic
Hungarians who traditionally fear Serbian dominance.

   About a dozen people were arrested on charges of fighting,
according to a police official speaking on condition of anonymity.
No injuries were reported.
   The demonstration in Isola Capo Rizzuto on Italy's southern

   A pet piglet that led police on a three-hour
chase was finally nabbed by a farm agent who got down on the ground
and lured the animal with a handful of horse feed.
   ``It's easy _ you just have to be faster than the pig,'' said
Deputy Jack ``Hi-Ho'' Hrabovsky, a member of the Hillsborough
County Sheriff's Office Agricultural Unit.
   Blackie, an 8-month-old, 40-pound pig, spent the night behind
bars at the city's impoundment lot before being sent to the
sheriff's farm for ``wayward'' animals in Plant City.
   The pig's brush with the law began as owner David A. Brown
carried him along a city street late Thursday night. Officer Gary
Yost stopped to chat, and soon learned through a computer check
that Brown was wanted for violating probation on a charge of
driving under the influence of alcohol.
   As Brown was arrested, Blackie took off.
   For three hours, Yost and another Tampa officer pursued the
porker, at times catching a glimpse of the elusive swine in the
glare of police spotlights. About 2 a.m. Friday, they called
Hrabovsky.
   ``I was asleep when they called and asked if I could come catch
a pig,'' said Hrabovsky, who arrived to find police and the pig in
a standoff.
   ``I got down on the ground with him and took a handful of horse
feed and waited for him,'' he said.
   When the pig came to Hrabovsky, officers nabbed it.
   ``I tried to take Blackie with me, but the officers said they
had to take him so I just put him in the back seat of their car,''
Hrabovsky said. ``I guess they didn't know the procedure ... being
their first time and all that.''
   Brown remained in the Hillsborough County Jail late Friday, and
no hearing date or bail had been set.
   Meanwhile, Hrabovsky took Blackie to Plant City. The pig will be
auctioned off if Brown doesn't claim him in 40 days, but Hrabovsky
said he'd try to place Blackie with Brown's family.
   ``This is one gentle pig,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Businesses in Armenia tried to make up for lost
time Saturday after a crippling strike, but a walkout continues in
a disputed Armenian region of a neighboring republic, Soviet news
reports said.
   State-run television reported Saturday in its evening news
program ``Vremya'' that 54,000 businesses in the Armenian capital,
Yerevan, that normally stay closed on weekends had opened.
   The extra hours were aimed at catching up after a strike that
began July 4 and tapered off last week, the program said.
   But the broadcast said a strike continued in the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan Saturday despite a televised
appeal by the local Communist Party chief for Armenians to return
to work.
   State-run Radio Moscow said the situation remains tense in
Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, where residents have been
on strike since May 23 as they demand the incorporation of their
district into Armenia.
   On Monday the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's top
executive body, refused to alter the status of the district, which
has a predominantly Armenian population but no common borders with
the Armenian republic.
   In another development, the wife of Paruyr Ayrikyan, a jailed
Armenian activist the Presidium ordered expelled Wednesday, said
she had learned he was taken from Yerevan to Moscow. Lena Ayrikyan,
in a telephone interview, said it was not clear whether her husband
would be sent out of the Soviet Union via Moscow.
   A KGB agent reported the activist's transfer in a meeting Friday
with a sister of Ayrikyan, Mrs. Ayrikyan said.
   Ayrikyan, a leader of an Armenian nationalist group, was
arrested March 25 on a charge of defaming the state and imprisoned
in Yerevan. In ordering him exiled, the Presidium stripped Ayrikyan
of his Soviet citizenship and pardoned him.
   The U.S. Embassy has said Soviet officials have contacted them
about resettling Ayrikyan in the United States, where he has
relatives. Mrs. Ayrikyan said she had not been allowed to speak to
her husband and didn't know whether he might be headed for the
United States.
   The government newspaper Izvestia claimed Saturday that Ayrikyan
appealed to the Presidium June 1 to drop the criminal charges
against him and allow him to emigrate to the West. It accused
Ayrikyan of advocating more serious changes than annexing
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   On Wednesday, Armenian activists called for a resumption of the
general work stoppage to protest the Presidium's rejection of their
annexation demand. But Yerevan residents and the state-run media
have indicated people were generally ignoring the strike call.

   Thousands of Jews gathered at the Wailing Wall
Saturday to pray amid tight security after Palestinians battled
police in Jerusalem.
   Police fired rubber bullets and arrested 14 Palestinians during
clashes in which one Israeli and a Palestinian were injured,
according to broadcast reports. They said police used tear gas to
break up an anti-Arab demonstration by Jewish militants.
   The fighting came as Jews and Moslems were beginning religious
celebrations this weekend centering on the same site in Jerusalem's
walled Old City.
   Such skirmishes have made this disputed city a part of the
seven-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israelis seized control of
Arab east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967
Middle East War.
   Israeli television reported that many rabbis throughout the
country urged worshipers to attend prayer services at the Wailing
Wall and not be frightened away by Palestinian violence.
   Hundreds of riot police patrolled east Jerusalem as Jews began
observing Tisha B`Av, which marks the destruction of the Holy
Temple by the Romans 2,000 years ago.
   Services were conducted at the Wailing Wall, a retaining wall of
the Temple Mount and the only remnant of the ancient Jewish temple.
   Later this weekend Moslems begin celebrating the four-day Eid
al-Adha festival that commemorates the story of Abraham's planned
sacrifice of his son on the Temple Mount, which they call Haram
al-Sharif. Abraham instead sacrificed a sheep.
   With its importance to both faiths, the Temple Mount area has
become one of the flashpoints of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
   Some people who have prayed at the Wailing Wall in previous
years said there were fewer worshipers this year.
   Debbie Albert, a tourist from Philadelphia, said she would not
``let a little rock-throwing keep me from the holiest place in
Judaism. I am here because if we don't come, they'll win.''
   Israel radio said a Palestinian and an Israeli suffered head
injuries during a battle involving Arabs, police and Jewish
students from a seminary in the Old City's Moslem quarter.
   It said the violence began after a memorial procession attended
by hundreds of Palestinians for 15-year-old Nidal Fuad Rabadi who
was fatally shot Tuesday on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem.
   Fighting spread to the Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances
to the Old City. Police ordered shopkeepers there to close stores
and fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd of Arabs stocking up
for the Moslem holiday.
   Hundreds of Arabs and tourists rushed out of the area to escape
the gas.
   Israel television reported police also used tear gas to disperse
demonstrators belonging to the militantly anti-Arab Kach movement,
headed by U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   According to U.N. figures, 231 Palestinians and four Israelis
have been killed since the uprising began Dec. 8.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, given this week by Rep.
Beryl Anthony of Arkansas:
   Good afternoon. This is Congressman Beryl Anthony, Jr., from the
Fourth Congressional District in Arkansas.
   As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
I'd like to visit with you about the renewed spirit within the
Democratic party. As Democrats leave Atlanta where we held our
national convention this week and scatter from one corner of our
nation to the other, the enthusiasm for the Democratic party is
spreading like wildfire across the prairie.
   It's a spirit we haven't felt since John Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson filled us with hope and provided opportunities to all
working men and women. In 1988, we have another Massachusetts-Texas
team just as dedicated and just as capable of getting the country
back on the right track.
   In Atlanta, we nominated a presidential ticket of Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Today,
the Dukakis-Bentsen team will carry its message of hope and
opportunity to the valley of Central California, and then, move on
to the plains of North Dakota.
   In Atlanta, Democrats recaptured a sense of party unity that has
been missing for too long, and while we celebrated solidarity, we
also debated.
   Democrats in 1988 can debate without becoming divided for a
simple reason _ we share a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs
and challenges of all Americans, not just our closest friends.
   After eight years of a Republican administration, fueled by
selfish and sometimes unlawful motives, the American people are
looking for a return to the basic values of common respect,
compassion, and concern for all. And as Michael Dukakis promised,
we are determined to forge a new era of greatness.
   This fall, the Republicans will brag about low unemployment, low
inflation and sustained growth. But you and I know, we've paid a
big price for their bragging rights. Ohio and Michigan have paid
dearly with plant shutdowns. In our heartland, it's a daily
struggle for farmers to keep their farms. And if you brag about
sustained growth in Oklahoma and Louisiana, the folks there would
laugh, or maybe cry.
   George Bush was right eight years ago when he called Ronald
Reagan's policies ``voodoo economics.'' He seems to have forgotten
that, and forgotten the needs of the working men and women of this
country. Soon, Mr. Bush may begin to feel like a voodoo doll, when
he is stuck with explaining his administration's legacy of debts
and deficits.
   Voters who supported Reagan and Bush are now disillusioned
because this administration couldn't keep its promises. George Bush
will pay the price as many of these supporters return home where
they belong _ to the Democratic party. We're already hearing from
these folks. From Desha County, Arkansas, a farmer friend called me
recently.
   He said: ``Beryl, I'm sorry I voted for Reagan and Bush. I'll do
it again. Now, I need your help.'' My reply was simple: ``There's
no need to apologize. Just remember how empty those promises were
and that George Bush will try to hoodwink the public again.''
   Throughout most of the 1980s, Democrats in the Congress were the
safety net for the American people. We fought to protect your basic
rights. It was difficult at times, but our efforts have paid off.
It was Democrats in Congress who crusaded far and fast for
catastrophic health insurance.
   It was Democrats in Congress who initiated in fast trade
legislation to protect American jobs for opening more world
markets. It was Democrats who said it's only fair and decent to
give workers 60 days notice when they lose their jobs. And
Democrats even cooperated with the President in strengthening our
national defense.
   But Reagan and Bush took it too far to the point where crime
corruption and greed set in. Clearly, the priorities of the last
eight years served the interest of ambitious Reagan appointees and
the elite of our society.
   This administration favors missile systems over school systems
and supports payments to international drug-traffickers, but
doesn't fund programs to stop drugs at our borders. I think you'll
agree, it's time to straighten out our priorities.
   National security is no longer simply a debate over missiles and
troops _ it's a concern for the American family. It's a renewal of
the dream that our children will have greater opportunities. Every
American deserves the right to share the same hopes and dreams _
the hope that all of our children will receive quality education,
that adequate health is available for all, that all our children
will be able to afford to buy a house, and that all our children's
children will have a better quality of life.
   These hopes will remain just dreams if you, my fellow Americans,
don't get involved in the political process. The 1988 election will
be one of the most important ones in our lifetime. It's the
Democratic commitment to invest in our most precious natural
resource _ the American people _ that will propel this nation into

<HEAD>Land Purchase Nearly Doubles State Parkland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas' largest parkland acquisition in
history, the massive Big Bend Ranch, is putting the state Parks and
Wildlife Department into high gear. The $8.8 million purchase
nearly doubles the state parks system.
   ``It's a bargain,'' said Chuck Nash, chairman of the state Parks
and Wildlife Commission. ``This great property will provide a new
and exciting opportunity for the citizens of Texas to enjoy one of
the state's wildest and most beautiful places.''
   The purchase of the 215,000-acre ranch in Brewster and Presidio
counties in western Texas ends a 15-year struggle by former state
Land Commissioner Bob Armstrong to acquire the property.
   The parks system now has about 220,000 acres of land.
   ``It's really a unique area and we plan to keep it that way,''
said Armstrong, now a commission member. ``It's unreal how many
outstanding geological features the ranch has.''
   The ranch includes the Solitario, an extinct volcano with an
8-mile diameter, and is known to provide habitats for at least 11
endangered species of plants and animals.
   The purchase, approved by the commission Thursday, is expected
to be completed within three weeks. Title to the ranch is held by
Humble Oil and Gas Co., owned by Robert O. Anderson of New Mexico
and Walter Mischer of Houston.
   As land commissioner in the late 1970s, Armstrong negotiated a
trade of state lands for the ranch. But the swap was opposed by
several legislators and never completed.
   Armstrong described the ranch as one of the Southwest's most
significant natural resources. Covering about 336 square miles, it
is about one-third the size of nearby Big Bend National Park. The
ranch is about 350 miles southeast of El Paso.

<HEAD>Report: Three Drunk Policemen Disrupt Mass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three drunk policemen entered a church
linked to the outlawed Solidarity union and disrupted a Mass before
being evicted by worshipers, a Solidarity spokeswoman said Saturday.
   A scuffle broke out during the service Friday night at St.
Brygida's Church in Gdansk, said Joanna Wojciechowicz, speaking
from her home in the Baltic port city.
   She said one officer threw a knife and another used his
truncheon to ward off angry worshipers but the policemen, all in
uniform, were subdued and removed from the building.
   Police summoned by the parish priest, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski,
later located the three officers and detained them, according to
the spokeswoman.
   A duty officer at Gdansk police headquarters declined to comment
about the incident.
   The church is a few blocks from the Lenin shipyard where
Solidarity was founded in the fall of 1980 to become the only free
union federation in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was suspended by
the communist government in December 1981 and subsequently
outlawed. There have been frequent pro-Solidarity demonstrations at
the church.

<HEAD>Man Cheered by Reinstatement of Lawsuit over Products Derived from
His Blood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soft-drink distributor who maintains he should
get some of the profits from commercial products derived from his
blood and body tissues says he is pleased by a court ruling that
may lead to that.
   ``To me, this (ruling) is the ultimate vindication of the
rightness of what we're trying to do,'' John Moore said Friday
after learning the California 2nd District Court of Appeals
reinstated his suit against the University of California-Los
Angeles.
   Moore, 43, claims Dr. David Golde of UCLA never informed him of
the value of his blood while using it to develop a product that
scientists say offers considerable hope for treating cancer and
AIDS.
   His attorney in Los Angeles, Jonathan Zackey, said the ruling
was unprecedented.
   ``This is the first time an appellate court has ruled that a
patient has an interest in the unique properties of his genetic
material and that commercial exploitation without the patient's
consent entitles the patient to sue for damages,'' Zackey said.
   Private research companies paid UCLA $500,000 for exclusive
access to Moore's cells, Zackey said. Golde received benefits worth
about $1.5 million, and trade sources have indicated the full line
of treatments that could be developed from the cells might be worth
more than $3 billion, the lawyer added.
   An attorney for UCLA, Allen Wagner, said he might seek
reconsideration of the ruling or seek an appeal.
   Twelve years ago, Moore learned he had a rare blood disease
called hairy-cell leukemia, and in a relatively common treatment,
Golde removed his spleen.
   From that organ, Golde discovered Moore's blood possessed a
previously unknown capacity for fighting disease, and for the next
seven years he had the Seattle man frequently return to Los Angeles
to draw more blood.
   Moore said he never was told that researchers used his blood and
tissues to patent what they called the ``Mo-cell.''
   The product was developed by copying a unique characteristic
found in Moore's cells, a property that boosts production of
certain white blood cells which, in turn, stimulate the body's
first line of defense against some diseases.
   When patients consent to the removal of organs, they also
consent to disposal of the organs, including their use in research,
so Moore ``had abandoned any interests in the therapeutically
removed tissue,'' Wagner said.
   Since his spleen was removed, Moore has undergone no further
treatment and says the disease appears to be in remission.

<HEAD>Vets Returning to Vietnam to Clear Mine Fields</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by reports that land mines are maiming and
killing Vietnamese children, five veterans intend to return to
Southeast Asia to help clear mine fields they laid 20 years ago.
   ``I don't consider myself a Rambo type, and I don't consider
myself a Jane Fonda,'' former Cpl. Frank Noe said Saturday. ``I did
what I had to do, what I was told to do, during the war.
   ``And I'm doing what I feel is right to do now.''
   Noe, a 39-year-old firefighter in Stoughton, Mass., and four
fellow veterans of the 11th Marine Combat Engineering Battalion
have received the Vietnamese government's approval for a two-week
humanitarian mission in January.
   They plan to point out the perimeters of the fields they laid,
provide technical expertise on mines and, if necessary, comb the
jungle with metal detectors and probe the dirt with knives.
   Noe said they realize their actions may be dangerous and have
asked the Marine Corps to reduce the risk by turning over maps of
the fields.
   But a Marine Corps spokesman said the maps either never reached
the Pentagon or were tossed out long ago.
   ``If we kept everything back that far, this city would be buried
under paper,'' said Lt. Col. Frederick C. Peck of the Marine Corps
public affairs office in Washington.
   If that means the veterans have to rely on memories two decades
old, so be it, said former Lance Cpl. Nathaniel Genna, 40, of
Boston.
   ``I won't remember all the fields, but I'll remember the ones I
worked on,'' Genna said. ``You'd be surprised how well you recall
when you had ears on the back of your head and eyes on your rear
end.''
   Plans for the trip emerged from a September 1987 reunion in
Chicago, where Genna showed his companions a newspaper article in
which the Vietnamese government estimated 3,000 people _ many of
them children _ died from grenades, bombs and land mines between
1975 and 1985.
   Former Sgt. Eugene T. Spanos of Rosemont, Ill., who organized
the reunion, said the news hit him hard.
   ``I turned to one former battalion commander and said, `Sir, did
you take the mine fields out?,' and he said, `No.'
   ``So I turned to the other battalion commander who relieved him
and I said, `Did you?' And he said, `No.' So I said, `My God, all
these years have gone by, and we're still killing people over
there,'' recalled Spanos.
   After the reunion, Spanos, 40, contacted the Vietnamese mission
to the United Nations, wrote to other veterans and found an
anonymous donor willing to support the mine-clearing expedition,
which the veterans estimate will cost $30,000.
   Besides Spanos, Noe and Genna, the veterans who have volunteered
are William Johnson of Manchester, Conn., and Michael Wallace of
Langdon, Kan. All five served in Vietnam between 1967 and 1970.
   The group's translator and guide will be retired Marine Lt. Col.
Robert J. Dalton, who went to Hanoi last fall to help plan the
mission.
   ``I'm supporting them because it's a humanitarian effort I agree
with,'' Dalton said. ``I see this as an act of a reconciliation
between two governments that have been at odds for a long time _
and who better to do it than the young men who were sent to fight
the war in the first place.''

<TEXT>
   A bomb blew up Saturday on a road
near the Irish border and killed three members of a family headed
home after a vacation in the United States, police said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, admitted it was their bomb but that it
detonated prematurely and was meant for British soldiers, not
civilians.
   The blast blew a crater in the road and left bodies and luggage
scattered on the main road between Dublin and Belfast, witnesses
said.
   Killed in the explosion were Robert James Hanna and Maureen
Patricia Hanna, both 44, and their son David, 6.
   They were driving to their home in Hillsborough, 12 miles south
of Belfast, when the explosion occurred at about 10 a.m. near
Newry, about a mile from the Irish border, police said. It was not
immediately known where they vacationed in the United States.
   Three people in nearby cars were slightly injured.
   The explosion brought to 21 the number of people killed in
explosions in Northern Ireland this year, police said.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of the
predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   The IRA issued conflicting statements explaining the bombing.
   In a statement issued to journalists in Northern Ireland, the
South Armagh Brigade of the IRA said the Hannas were the
``unfortunate victims of mistaken identity.'' It said the attack
was a carefully planned military operation that ended in ``tragic
and unfortunate circumstances.''
   A later IRA statement said British scanning devices may have set
off the device, which was planned for British soldiers.
   ``This bomb which was to be detonated by remote control exploded
prematurely, tragically killing three civilians,'' it said.
   ``We are in a position to state that all volunteers in command
of the explosives did not detonate the device. Without shirking
responsibility for this tragedy, we are investigating the
possibility that the explosion could have occurred as a result of
British forces who were in the vicinity using electronic scanning
devices,'' the IRA said.
   Officials speculated the IRA mistook the family's jeep for a
Land Rover used by British security forces. Security forces
regularly patrol the area.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary denounced the IRA statement.
   Police described Hanna as a company director. They said the
couple had a 17-year-old son and an 19-year-old daughter who were
not traveling with them.
   The Hanna family, in a statement later Saturday, said they were
``stunned and hurt'' and wished to mourn in private.
   British security forces sealed off the area.
   ``When I came out from getting petrol, I saw parts of bodies
lying all over the road,'' a witness said. ``A (jeep) was blown
into a field and two other cars were damaged,'' another witness
said.
   ``From what I could see there were a couple of cars lying in the
crater. There was debris everywhere,'' said another witness. All
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A nearby abandoned house was demolished in the explosion.
   The blast occurred near the spot where a Northern Ireland judge
and his wife were killed by an IRA bomb 15 months ago. Three years
ago, four Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were killed by a bomb
at almost the same spot.
   Jim Nicholson, a former legislator in the Protestant Unionist
Party, said the IRA ``would react with another sickening apology
for the deaths of three innocent people.''
   On July 8, the IRA apologized for killing two civilians, who
died along with a British soldier and an IRA guerrilla during two
bombings and two mortar attacks. An IRA statement said the
operation went ``tragically wrong.''
   Gordon Mawhinney of the non-sectarian Alliance Party described
the bombers Saturday as savages and said they could only be
defeated ``if the community act against terrorism.''

   Heavy rain fell along parts of the East Coast on Saturday, with
rain also scattered across the northern Plains and Midwest, and
temperatures cooled to record lows over the south-central states.
   Showers and thunderstorms, some producing locally heavy rain,
were scattered ahead of a stationary front from Florida through the
lower and middle Atlantic Coast states to Maryland.
   Thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on eastern North Carolina during
the morning, including more than 2 inches at Wilmington, where the
ground was already saturated from nearly 7 inches that caused
street flooding on Friday.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over West
Virginia, Ohio, Lower Michigan and parts of western Pennsylvania.
Toledo, Ohio, got 1-inch diameter hail.
   Isolated thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front over
northeastern South Dakota.
   Isolated thunderstorms also broke out over northeastern New
Mexico, western Kansas, the Front Range of the Rockies and the
Texas Panhandle.
   Record lows Saturday were 63 at Monroe, La., and 61 at Paducah,
Ky. Calico Rock, Ark., tied its record low of 55 and San Antonio,
Texas, tied its record of 68.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 62
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 at Twentynine Palms,
Calif. Saturday morning's low was 36 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Florida and the eastern Gulf Coast region through the Atlantic
Coast states to Maine. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also
were forecast ahead of a cold front over northwestern Wisconsin,
western Iowa, southeastern Nebraska and northwestern Missouri, and
over eastern Colorado.
   Highs only in the 50s and 60s were predicted across Maine; in
the 70s over the rest of New England and New York state; in the 70s
and 80s over sections of the California coast and western
Washington state; in the 80s from the northern Plains and eastern
Colorado through the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes
states to the middle Atlantic Coast states and the Carolinas; from
100 to 110 in the desert Southwest and the valleys of California;

<TEXT>
   A group of intellectuals prayed and
fasted Saturday to pressure authorities to ease travel
restrictions, news reports said.
   The reports of the hunger strike followed an announcement by
Premier Karoly Grosz earlier last week that his communist
government was preparing to lift such restrictions on people
sentenced for participating in the 1956 anti-communist uprising.
The rebellion was put down by Soviet tanks.
   Grosz, who became national Communist Party leader in a major
reshuffle in May, began a 10-day U.S. visit on Tuesday. The hunger
strikers started Tuesday and reportedly intended to carry out their
protest for the duration of his visit.
   The Magyar Nemzet daily newspaper carried an interview with the
hunger strikers, and a popular Saturday afternoon radio news
program allowed them to broadcast their grievances. The reports did
not say how many people were taking part in the protest.
   Magyar Nemzet also quoted Ferenc Koeszeg, editor of the
underground journal Beszeloe, as saying the strikers wanted to
appeal to public opinion after repeated applications for passports
were refused.
   The Saturday radio news magazine ``168 hours'' reported that the
hunger strikers had addressed a letter to the justice minister and
intended to send another to the government asking that citizen's
rights be better guaranteed.
   The news media were taking advantage of a new government policy,
initiated under Grosz, allowing greater dissent. It is similar to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness.
   Hungary liberalized some travel laws Jan. 1, granting most
citizens passports for unlimited travel in East and West, provided
they have needed funds.
   Koeszeg was quoted as saying Friday that the hunger strikers
welcomed the move to abandon restrictions related to 1956.
   However, he told the newspaper that only one protester, Jenoe
Fonay, would be affected. The journalist said Fonay was associated
with the leaders of the 1956 revolt.
   The other strikers were denied passports under a regulation
allowing police to refuse exit to Hungarians deemed to have
violated unpublished regulations governing behavior on previous
trips abroad, Koeszeg said.

   About 400 Thai troopers and U.S.
Marines invaded a beach in central Thailand Saturday in joint
military exercises condemned by Thailand's communist neighbors.
   The troops made the assault on Yao Beach in Cholburi province 80
miles south of Bangkok. The seventh annual joint maneuvers, called
Cobra Gold 88, involves about 15,000 military personnel and is to
end Aug. 2.
   Thailand is bordered on the east by the communist regimes of
Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam sent more than 100,000 soldiers into
Cambodia in late 1978 and replaced the radical Khmer Rouge
government with another communist administration. An alliance of
the Khmer Rouge and anti-communist forces is waging guerrilla
warfare against the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
   William A. Brown, the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, said of Cobra
Gold 88: ``The message is the U.S. military have a good security
partner in the Thais. Our intent remains as always to keep the
peace, to deter aggression and this is an important element of it.''
   Cambodia's official radio station on Wednesday quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as denouncing the U.S.-Thai exercises.
   It quoted the spokesman as saying, ``Aircraft, tanks, and
armored personnel carriers are used ... which have occasionally
intruded deep into Cambodian territory in violation of Cambodia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
   Brown was asked about the complaints and he replied, ``The
Vietnamese say this is saber rattling. It's no such thing.''

   Police were looking Saturday for a
cream-colored pickup truck that may be linked to an explosion that
damaged the east entrance to Loogootee High School.
   The Friday night blast created enough force to destroy a metal
door and hurl pieces of the bomb up to 100 yards away, police said.
No injuries were reported in the 9:45 p.m. explosion, which was
heard over the entire town.
   Damage was estimated by police at $500.
   An older model pickup truck, which had a darker-colored stripe
along the side, was seen near the school at the time of the
explosion, state police dispatcher Richard Weintraut said.
   ``We're waiting on an Indiana State Police bomb investigator to
come up this morning for further investigation,'' said Loogootee
Chief of Police John Hunt.
   On July 5, 13 improperly wired time bombs were found in Salem,
about 50 miles east of Loogootee in southern Indiana. There was no
evidence the two incidents were related, Hunt said.
   The Salem incident involved dynamite improperly wired to timed
fuses. None of those bombs exploded. The Loogootee bomb was a fused
pipe bomb that was lit by someone shortly before it went off, Hunt
said.
   The only similarities were that neither bomber knew how to wire
a bomb correctly, Hunt said.
   ``Whoever made these bombs here didn't know what they were
doing,'' he said. ``The state investigator said whoever made the
bomb was real lucky it didn't explode while they were making it.''
   Earlier this month, police discovered an unfinished pipe bomb in
the center of an intersection about a block from the school.
   ``It looked like someone had made it and it fell out of a
vehicle or something,'' Hunt said. ``It looked like someone had
been experimenting, trying to make something like a homemade bomb,
but didn't get it finished. It didn't have any powder, wasn't
fused.''
   ``The school teachers are starting to get worried,'' Hunt said.
``They don't know if they want to go back to school or not.''
   Police talked to several teachers and neighbors Saturday, but
none reported receiving any threats, he said.
   Said one local officer who spoke on condition he not be
identified: ``What we are afraid of is that whoever is doing this
is practicing and the bombs might get bigger and bigger. We hope it
stops right now before someone gets hurt.''

<HEAD>New Dade County Teacher Contract Sets Top Pay At $64,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers could earn up to $64,000 under a tentative
contract agreement with Dade County that a schools spokesman
describes as one of the nation's ``most progressive'' and raises
salaries 28 percent.
   The three-year contract, which the teachers' union and school
board must still approve, sets average pay for the new academic
year at $33,066, Dade County school spokesman Andy Gollan said
Saturday. Average pay nationally is $28,031, according to National
Education Association figures.
   ``We believe this is very far reaching, aside from salary
considerations,'' Gollan said after negotiators reached a
settlement. ``There's an increased voice for teachers in a number
of areas, for example in the selection of principals. We believe
this to be the most progressive teacher contract in the United
States.''
   With 255,000 students in 260 schools, Dade County has the
fourth-biggest school district in the nation, behind New York, Los
Angeles and Chicago.
   Dade's school system, with 15,000 teachers, received national
attention earlier this year because of a program that gives local
schools more autonomy and lets teachers' councils help make
decisions.
   The program also aims to improve inner-city schools by involving
various community organizations, offering Saturday classes and
various professional growth initiatives.
   Gollan said the school system enthusiastically favors generous
raises, so that overall salaries would average $33,066 in the first
year of the contract, $36,042 in the second and $39,646 in the
third.
   A new teacher would receive $23,000 yearly, and an educator with
14 years of experience and a doctorate, who teaches summer school,
could earn up to $64,000 under the proposed pay scale, he said.
   ``It's a nationally recognized idea that teachers should be paid
more for the work they do,'' Gollan said.

   Workers at seven semiconductor plants owned by
Japan's largest electric machinery manufacturer will give up summer
vacations because of a worldwide shortage of computer chips, a news
report said Saturday.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, quoting unidentified industry
sources, said workers at seven Hitachi Ltd. semiconductor plants
agreed Friday to a management proposal that they skip their
vacations, usually lasting about a week in mid-August.
   No details were given on the agreement. Officials were not
available for comment because of the weekend holiday.
   Kyodo said two other major Japanese chip makers, Fujitsu Ltd.
and Mitsubishi Electric Corp., are negotiating with their unions
over a similar cancellation of summer holidays.
   Buyers are urging chip makers to maintain or increase production
to make up for serious chip shortages, expected to last until next
spring, Kyoto said.
   The brisk computer sales have caused the chip shortage, it said.

   George Bush declared Saturday that he
would win both the South and the Southwest, despite concentrated
efforts in the region by the new Democratic team and a shortage of
campaign funds that he called troublesome.
   Standing on the bank of the drought-depressed Mississippi River,
the Republican vice president proclaimed, ``If we are successful in
getting the truth out there, they (Democrats) will be unsuccessful
in drawing the traditional Southern Democrats and Southwest
Democrats back into the fold.''
   ``I have to help get the truth out there,'' he added. Both
regions went solidly for the Reagan-Bush ticket in both 1980 and
1984.
   The ``truth'' the prospective GOP presidential nominee said he
wants to spread would be his ``major philosophical differences with
Michael Dukakis,'' whom he called a ``traditional liberal.''
   However, Bush said he does not see similar differences with
Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
He said he agrees with Bentsen on most issues.
   Bush is on a two-day campaign swing through the South and
Southwest to try to seek to regain momentum lost to the Democrats
during their convention. Democrats are expected to make a major
effort to win back the region, beginning with heavy campaigning by
Dukakis and Bentsen.
   Dukakis, while campaigning in Modesto, Calif., was asked to
comment on President Reagan's characterization during his weekly
radio address of the Democratic convention message as ``midnight in
America.''
   The Democratic candidate said he had no response, but said, ``We
want to stress a positive message. ... That's the idea ... They
know we're going to have a chance.''
   In their second day of campaigning together, Dukakis and Bentsen
attended a rally of several thousand people in Modesto and then
moved on to Minot, N.D.
   Addressing a law enforcement group in Tampa, Fla., Bush
reiterated his call for stricter enforcement of drug laws and for
the death penalty for drug ``kingpins.''
   ``We've heard a lot of tough talk about drugs from the liberals
in Congress, but when are we going to see some tough action?'' Bush
asked. ``We need more money for prisons and prosecutors. And we
need tougher penalties for criminals.''
   At an airport news conference in Tampa, Bush said the bump in
the polls Dukakis got from the Democratic convention had served to
keep him in the position of underdog.
   But, he said, ``I like being behind ... I like fighting back. I
remember Iowa.'' Bush referred to his loss to Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., in the Iowa caucuses.
   The vice president was scheduled to campaign in Albuquerque,
N.M., on Sunday.
   The Bush campaign has all but used up the entire $27 million it
is permitted in pre-convention spending. Bush has only been able to
travel in recent days by coupling campaign events with GOP
fund-raising events _ such as a luncheon he attended here and
another dinner scheduled for Tampa.
   The funds are being raised for the national party for the fall
election, with some of the money channeled back to pay for Bush's
current travel.
   However, this limits his ability to take long trips, and most of
his recent campaign appearances have been confined to day trips,
with returns to Washington most evenings.
   This has had an inhibiting effect on campaign travel,
particularly to distant states, Bush conceded in a conversation
with reporters traveling with him on Air Force Two.
   ``It is troublesome,'' Bush said.
   Once Republicans hold their convention in August, his campaign
will be infused with more than $43 million in public funds.
   Bush was briefed on the condition of the Mississippi River, 20
feet lower than its usual height at this time of year, although
Bush was told that the river is expected to rise by about six feet
in the next week or so.
   Bush said he joined with the U.S. Corps of Engineers in opposing
a plan to divert more Great Lakes water into the river, claiming it
would not help that much and could cause environmental problems.
   He told a news conference that he would soon begin screening
potential GOP vice presidential candidates, possibly as soon as
next week, with financial disclosure forms to be sent to those he
will put on ``a long list.''
   Bush also said his campaign would conduct private polls to
determine the vote-drawing appeal of various candidates.
   But, he said, he would not conduct interviews or do anything
else that would be demeaning or elevate hopes of the people he
would be considering.
   Claiming he wanted to announce his choice at the GOP convention,
Bush said ``I will not leak my decision to anybody. But if I talk
in my sleep and my wife finds out about it, I'm in for serious
trouble.''
   ``I've told Barbara this is to be a real personal decision.''
   Asked about the declaration of California Gov. George Deukmejian
on Friday that he wanted to take himself out of consideration, Bush
said ``I really haven't had time to sort that one out.''
   ``I have enormously high regard for `our Duke,''' Bush said of
Deukmejian.
   He also went out of his way to praise to Tennesseans who are
frequently mentioned as possible running mates _ former Sen. Howard
Baker and former Gov. Lamar Alexander _ but again, said he
currently had no short list of favorites.
   Bush brushed aside a profile of Dukakis in the Soviet Communist
party newspaper Pravda, which appeared to suggest that the
Democratic nominee was more intelligent than Bush.
   ``I'm going to send (Soviet Leader) Gorbachev a photostat copy
of my Phi Beta Kappa key,'' quipped the 1948 Yale graduate.

<TEXT>
   The condition of a 2-year-old Ukrainian girl
whose mother believes her brain tumor was caused by the Chernobyl
nuclear accident was upgraded from critical, a hospital spokeswoman
said Saturday.
   Hanna Andrievna Sverstiuk, who had a brain tumor removed at
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was listed in stable condition
in the intensive care unit, said spokeswoman Martha Phan.
   ``She's doing real well,'' Phan said.
   Neurosurgeons removed the core of Hanna's brain tumor during a
nearly six-hour operation Friday and awaited test results to
determine whether the growth is benign or malignant. Phan said the
results are expected by Monday.
   Hanna's mother, Maria Sverstiuk, has said she believes the
walnut-sized tumor that was at the base of the child's brain stem
resulted from the radiation of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, 50
miles from Kiev in the Soviet Union.
   Hanna was born in Kiev five days after the April 26, 1986,
explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a
cloud of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe.
Two months ago, Hanna was diagnosed as having a brain tumor.
   Dr. Leonard A. Bruno, a neurosurgeon, said it is unlikely that
exposure to Chernobyl's radiation would cause a solid tumor, the
type of growth removed from Hanna's brain, in an infant.
   ``Radiation can be the cause of tumors of any kind,'' he said.
``However, the type of radiation one would get from a situation
like Chernobyl has a much longer latency period _ 10 to 20 years.''
   The toddler's trip to the United States followed efforts of
Ukrainian communities on both sides of the Atlantic and
negotiations between officials in Washington and Moscow.

<HEAD>Indian Atomic Energy Chairman Denies Diversion of Heavy Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of India's Atomic Energy
Commission on Saturday denied reports that India has illegally
imported heavy water for its nuclear plants, a news agency said.
   M.R. Srinivasan said India has been producing heavy water since
the 1960s, and it ``has been self-sufficient for her needs,'' the
United News of India reported. ``There is no question of importing
illegally. In fact, at one stage we had exported to Belgium.''
   He spoke at a news conference at Poona near Bombay.
   Newspaper reports in the United States, Europe and India have
said India may have received the water in shipments secretly
diverted from Norway, the Soviet Union and Romania. Opposition
party members in West Germany have charged that some of the
Norwegian heavy water was diverted with the help of a West German
firm.
   The shipments allegedly were diverted in the early 1980s. India
has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and reports
have suggested the heavy water could have been used to produce
plutonium for making nuclear weapons.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, looks like ordinary water but
has an extra neutron. It is used to cool a nuclear reactor by
moderating the speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction.
   India has six plants that manufacture heavy water, and two more
are under construction. Two of India's three nuclear power plants
require heavy water.
   The government says it plans more such plants to reduce its
dependence on fossil fuels.

<HEAD>Cardinal Calls For Regional Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CEBU, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the country's two Roman Catholic
cardinals called Saturday for peace negotiations at the regional
level to end the 19-year-old communist insurgency.
   Cardinal Ricardo Vidal of Cebu released a statement urging the
government and rebels to ``sit down and face each other once more.''
   He added ``this cannot be done if others stand up and fight. A
dialogue demands an atmosphere of sincerity and of course safety.
Firing has to cease in the meantime.''
   In proposing regional talks, the cardinal said: ``Such dialogues
are better held within a locality. The more familiar the
personalities involved, the better the issues are identified and
easier settled.''
   President Corazon Aquino's government reached a two-month
cease-fire agreement with the rebels in December 1986 and tried to
negotiate a political solution.
   But the talks broke down in January and fighting resumed after
the end of the cease-fire period the following month. Attempts to
revive the talks have failed.
   In the fighting, communist guerillas attacked a power station in
a southern town and raided a hospital in the northern Philippines,
military and news reports said Saturday. They gave these accounts:
   About 40 rebels of the New People's Army attacked the power
station in the town of Tudela Thursday night with rifle fire,
destroying four transformers and 45 voltage regulators. Another
power station had been attacked Wednesday and the two assaults
blacked out seven towns in Misamis Occidental province.
   In northern Cagayan province some 100 rebels raided a hospital
in the town of Tuao a week ago and fled with the medical supplies.
   No casualties were reported in the attacks.
   An estimated 3,000 members of anti-communist groups held a
``prayer rally'' Saturday in a downtown Manila park. The rally was
organized by the ``Philippines, Return to God'' movement that said
the action was to ``awaken the people to the evils and godlessness
of communism.''

   Chemical wastes in the Szamos River
that flows into Hungary from Romania have moved into the Tisza
River, killing thousands of fish, the Magyar Nemzet newspaper
reported Saturday.
   It quoted Lajos Szlavik, a water conservation director, as
saying Romanian officials said they were not aware of any pollution
in the Szamos River on their side of the border but they agreed to
participate in tests.
   Szlavik told the newspaper a net had been placed to keep the
dead fish from flowing downstream and about 3,300 pounds of fish
have been collected.
   Hungarian tests determined that the water was polluted with
chemicals and oxygen in the river had fallen below critical levels,
according to Szlavik.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis leads Republican George Bush by 17 percentage points,
according to a copyright poll by Newsweek magazine released
Saturday.
   The weekly news magazine said the poll shows that if the
election were held now, registered voters would favor Dukakis over
Bush by a margin of 55 percent to 38 percent.
   Black support for Dukakis reached 81 percent, with 74 percent of
black voters polled saying they were more likely to vote for the
Massachusetts governor after watching or reading about last week's
Democratic convention in Atlanta.
   Women voters back Dukakis more strongly than men, according to
the poll. Fifty-eight percent of the women surveyed said they would
vote for Dukakis while only 51 percent of the men said they would.
   Thirty-two percent of those who voted for President Reagan four
years ago said they plan to vote for Dukakis, while only 8 percent
of those who voted for Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in 1984
said they would cast a vote for Vice President Bush, who is certain
to become the Republican candidate next month.
   Newsweek said the poll found that only 24 percent of those
polled believe Bush is ``forceful and decisive,'' while 52 percent
agree that such a characterization fits Dukakis.
   The Newsweek poll was conducted by the Gallup organization,
which contacted a total of 948 registered voters on July 21-22. The
margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Mercenary For Contras One-Day Sentence, $50 Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American mercenary received one
day's probation and a $50 fine after pleading guilty to violating
the federal Neutrality Act by plotting to send civilian fighters to
help the Contras.
   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger refused to comment on the
sentence he gave on Friday to Joe Sam Adams, one of seven men
indicted earlier this month for activities aiding the Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras.
   ``If Roettger gave a sentence like that, what does it tell
you?'' said Rick Goldman, one of Adams' attorneys. ``Obviously, the
sentence reflects the judge's feelings about the indictment.''
   The Neutrality Act prohibits American citizens from trying to
overthrow a nation ``at peace'' with the United States.
   But attorneys for the defendants scoffed at the notion that the
United States is at peace with the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
   The original federal inquiry that started about two years ago in
Florida helped expose the Iran-Contra affair, but the seven
indicted this month were not major players in the underground
Contra aid network.
   Attorneys for the defendants have said their clients were
singled out to silence those in the network who had become critics
of the administration, while those who gave the orders were not
prosecuted.
   A spokesman for the Christic Institute _ which is appealing a
$24 million civil lawsuit relating to Contra aid efforts, alleged
guns-for-drugs deals and other covert activities _ said the light
punishment for Adams was no big surprise.
   ``This conforms with our experience that one can violate the law
to aid the Contras in the southern district of Florida without fear
of punishment,'' Christic spokesman Peter Dykstra said Saturday.
``We are upset but our anger lies more with the impunity that's
apparently afforded to those in Washington who gave the orders to
violate the law. That's why we intend to bring our case back
through the appeals process.''
   Adams pleaded guilty to the main charge of the indictment _ that
the defendants conspired to overthrow a foreign government while on
U.S. soil. Adams could have faced three years in prison.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldman said, ``I indicated to
the judge that I thought the sentence was fair.''
   Before appearing in Roettger's court, Adams pleaded innocent
before U.S. Magistrate Lurana Snow. He was released on $25,000 bond.
   Minutes later, Adams changed his plea to guilty and he and his
lawyers stood before Roettger for sentencing.
   Adams, 38, of St. Louis, is a marksman and professional weight
lifter as well as a former bodyguard for Adolfo Calero, a Contra
leader. He has said that he fought with the Contras in Nicaragua to
overthrow the country's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``I think certainly the judge sees this case for what it is, and
I think he recognizes how inappropriate the charges are,'' said
John Mattes, an assistant federal public defender who has
criticized the July 13 indictment for going after the ``foot
soldiers rather than the generals.''
   Five men named in the indictment have pleaded innocent.
   ``The sentence is absolutely phenomenal,'' said Doug Jones, the
lawyer for Tom Posey, an Alabama businessman named in the
indictment. ``I am sure that Mr. Adams and his attorneys are very
pleased.''
   One of the accused, mercenary-turned-whistle-blower Jack
Terrell, is expected to plead on Monday.
   Others indicted were Mario Calero, brother of Adolfo Calero;
Jose Coutin, a Miami Cuban and former Civilian Materiel Assistance
liaison here; Alex Martinez, a Cuban-American stockbroker; and Maco
Stewart, a former assistant state attorney general and state
representative in Texas.

<TEXT>
   The secretary of the U.S. Navy, William
Ball III, met Saturday with local defense officials as he wrapped
up a two-day visit to the Persian Gulf that was conducted under
extraordinarily tight security.
   An aide to Ball said his visit was a general overseas tour to
``see the troops.'' It was Ball's first trip to the area since
becoming Navy secretary this year, and it was not announced by the
Pentagon in advance.
   During the visit, Ball boarded the flagship Coronado, the
destroyer John Hancock and the mine sweeper Conquest _ three of the
approximately 16 American warships now in the gulf.
   The security included a bulletproof car.
   All Americans in the region have been cautioned about possible
terrorist acts in the aftermath of the July 3 downing of an Iranian
jetliner by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes. All 290 aboard the
plane were killed.
   U.S. officials meanwhile said they recovered a letter, bearing
10,000 signatures and expressing support for the Vincennes' captain
and crew, that was supposed to have been delivered to the warship
two days ago.
   The signature campaign was organized last weekend in San Diego,
the Vincennes' home port, by Rep. Bill Lowrey, R-Calif.
   The letter, which reportedly weighs about 50 pounds and is 1,000
feet long, had been mishandled on its way to the gulf through an
express delivery service, said Karl Higgins, a Lowrey aide.
Higgins, in a telephone interview from his home in San Diego, said
the letter was found in a London cargo terminal Saturday and was
shipped to Bahrain.
   Higgins said the letter would be delivered to the ship Sunday.
   The Vincennes sailed out of the gulf three days ago and is in
the Arabian Sea, according to a spokesman at U.S. Central Command
headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
   Although there has been speculation that the 9,600-ton cruiser
might be withdrawn from the region as a gesture toward reducing
tensions, military sources, who asked not to be identified, said
they had seen nothing to indicate the ship would leave before its
scheduled departure in late August.
   Ball's visit had been planned before Iran's announced acceptance
last week of a U.N. cease-fire plan for ending the 8-year-old war
with Iraq, according to U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Ball, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Sam H. Zakhem and Rear Adm.
Anthony Less, commander of the Joint Task Force Middle East, met
with Bahrain's defense minister, Sheik Khalifa Bin Ahmed al Khalifa.
   In keeping with the strict security, officials refused to
disclose the Navy secretary's destination after the gulf, other
than to say it was ``not in this area.''
   The United States is expected to reduce its naval force in the
Persian Gulf if the cease-fire is implemented. However, U.S.
officials here and at the Pentagon say it is too soon to speculate
on a timetable for a cutback.
   Naval sources, asking not to be further identified, said that
neither Ball's visit nor the departure on Saturday of two U.S.
warships was related to any reduction in force.
   The destroyer O'Brien and the missile frigate John H. Sides left
the port of Manama and headed toward the Strait of Hormuz toward
home after completing their three-month duty tours.
   The sources said both will be replaced by other warships now en
route.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Zia ul-Haq on Saturday
accused India of provoking ethnic violence in Pakistan's southern
province of Sind.
   ``We have fundamental proof, evidence to show to our friends in
India, that they have been interferring in Sind by trying to
isolate Sind from the rest of Pakistan,'' Zia said in a statement.
He did not elaborate.
   More than 40 people have been killed in ethnic fighting in Sind
during the past two months.
   In the latest incident, on July 17, the mayor of Hyderabad was
wounded in an assassination attempt and a Hyderabad city councilman
was killed in the attack. The shootings were followed by riots in
which seven people were killed.
   Much of the violence has involved Moslem immigrants who fled to
Pakistan from predominantly Hindu India in 1947 after the Indian
subcontinent received independence from Britain and was partitioned
into India and Pakistan.
   The immigrants are demanding recognition as a fifth ethnic group.
   Pakistan is ethnically divided into four major groups: Pathans
in the northwest, Punjabis in the eastern province of Punjab,
Baluchis in the western province of Baluchistan and Sindhis in Sind.
   Zia noted the immigrants have been in Pakistan more than 40
years and said: ``Why is it that now they have come all of a sudden
as a group demanding its rights? Because it has been provoked as
such, as a parochial element in order to advance political
reasons.''
   Zia denied Indian allegations that Pakistan is adding to the
violence in India's northern Punjab province. India claims Pakistan
is aiding militant Sikhs who are demanding an independent homeland
in that province bordering Pakistan.
   Sikhism is an offshoot of the Hindu religion. Pakistan is mainly
Moslem and Zia in mid-June invoked Islamic law, saying it took
precedence over existing legislation, and that Pakistan must become
an Islamic nation.
   He said Saturday, ``Anyone who considers that this is going to
be a secular state, or a state in which you can have Islam as a
religion between man and God only, is wrong.''

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis took his campaign to the nation's agricultural heartland on
Saturday, emphasizing his support for the farm family he called
``the backbone of this country.''
   Dukakis, with running mate Lloyd Bentsen at his side, appeared
before a huge crowd at the North Dakota State Fair and promised
that as president he would invest in rural development.
   ``If there's one thing I believe in it's the farm family because
it's the backbone of this country ... and our economy,'' Dukakis
said.
   The stop in Minot, in a state with the fewest electoral votes,
followed a morning rally in the central valley of California for an
early strike in the biggest battleground for electoral votes.
   ``Here I am the son of immigrants, running with the grandson of
immigrants,'' Dukakis told the cheering crowd of more than 5,000
overflowing from a park amphitheater in Modesto, Calif.
   ``This was a trip I wanted very much to make right after
Atlanta. To come out here, to the heartland of the country.'' he
said. ``To be in a valley which is America, because you are
America, all of you.''
   Even the music was designed to rouse local immigrant pride. As
the candidates entered and departed, the loudspeakers blared singer
Neil Diamond's song, ``America,'' about immigrants coming to
America and being proud of their new country, from the movie ``The
Jazz Singer.''
   The Massachusetts governor accepted gifts from children
representing local communities, including those from his own Greek
background. Wife Kitty put a Scottish cap on her husband, which he
showed off and then waved to the crowd.
   Kept off to the side was a noisy group of several dozen
anti-abortion protesters.
   In his speech, Dukakis threw in Greek, Spanish and Portuguese
phrases and got cheers from those groups. But his main pitch was to
economic issues and to what he called ``progressive values'' of
thrift and hard work, combined with help from the government
including expanded health insurance programs.
   He promised to find new uses for agricultural products and to
fight what he said was 12 percent unemployment in the Modesto area.
   The economic expansion of the Reagan administration was built on
a ``fiscal house of cards'' standing on the huge federal debt that
more than doubled during the past eight years, he said.
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, said the
Democrats ``don't want to level'' with the American people, trying
to hide their liberal politics.
   ``To hear them talk, you would never have guessed we are in the
biggest peacetime expansion in history,'' he said. When the
Democrats last controlled the White House, he said, ``America did a
heck of a lot worse.''
   The Democratic candidates were in the second day of a three-day
post convention swing across the country, with a strong
middle-America theme.
   On Friday, they campaigned in Bentsen's home state of Texas.
Sunday's plans included events in St. Louis and Erie, Pa., before
returning to Dukakis' native Boston.
   The rally was in the congressional district of Rep. Tony Coelho,
the third-ranking Democrat in the House, who said the ticket of
Dukakis and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen could wrest from the
Republicans two central valley voting groups which had strayed to
the Republican side in presidential elections.
   Dukakis appealed to the families of ethnic immigrants. Running
mate Bentsen, himself from a Rio Grande valley farm family,
appealed to those who moved to the rich agricultural valley from
Texas, Oklahoma and other states hit by the dust bowl of the
1930's, he said.
   ``If we can win the central San Joaquin valley, we can win the
state,'' said Coelho. California, with 47 electoral votes, has more
than any other state. The Democrats have not won it since 1964.
   Coelho, former chairman of the Democrats' national congressional
campaign committee, said Bush would probably neutralize the appeal
of the Democratic ticket in California if he chose Gov. George
Deukmejian as his running mate.

   Japan's Finance Ministry will investigate a real
estate firm at the hub of a stock scandal involving several of the
nation's top leaders, including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
news reports said Saturday.
   The scandal touches more than a dozen prominent political,
communications and other business leaders. They are suspected of
earning huge profits by obtaining unlisted shares of the company
and selling them after they were released on the market.
   ``We will investigate the case to disclose the whole picture,''
a senior Finance Ministry official was quoted as saying by the
nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun. The official was not
identified.
   Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, and former
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, a senior governing party official,
have acknowledged that their aides earned such profits. In Japan,
aides often act in such matters on behalf of their bosses.
   The Finance Ministry called on the real estate firm,
Recruit-Cosmos Co., to reveal the names of everyone who obtained
the company's unlisted stocks.
   Another leading daily, the Sankei Shimbun, said the Finance
Ministry will investigate to determine whether the dealings
violated the nation's Security and Exchange Law.

   President Reagan accused Democrats
Saturday of ignoring the accomplishments of his Republican
administration and ``singing the same sad song they sang four years
ago.''
   ``To them, it's midnight in America,'' Reagan said in his first
comment on the Democratic National Convention that ended Thursday
in Atlanta.
   ``To listen to the rhetoric, you would never guess the American
economy is the strongest it has been in a decade,'' he said.
   Reagan commented in his weekly radio address, delivered from his
mountaintop ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains north of here. The
president and first lady Nancy Reagan will return to Washington on
Sunday after a week-long vacation.
   While campaigning in Modesto, Calif., Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis was asked if he had any response to
Reagan's remarks.
   ``No,'' he said. ``We want to stress a positive message. ...
That's the idea. ... They know we're going to have a chance.''
   Later, Dukakis told reporters in Minot, N.D., ``If the
Republican Party thinks the way to win an election is basically to
tear the other guy down day after day, believe me (running mate)
Lloyd Bentsen and I can respond and will respond.''
   Dukakis said he dislikes ``ugly'' campaigns, ``but I also know
from painful experience that if the other side essentially runs a
negative campaign ... you have to respond and, believe me, Senator
Bentsen and I will respond. We're tough campaigners,'' Dukakis said.
   In his radio address, Reagan said, ``When their party left the
White House eight years ago, inflation was at one of the highest
levels in American history. Now, it's under control. Do they want
to turn that around?''
   Saying that his administration has improved American
competitiveness in world markets and improved American-Soviet
relations, he repeated, ``Do they want to turn that around, too?''
   ``They said America can do better,'' the president said. ``with
that, I wholeheartedly agree. But the people also know that the
last time our opponents were in charge, America did a heck of a lot
worse.''
   Reagan also said the Democrats are ``covering their tracks''
this year because they have found that the liberal policies they
have pursued in the past are unpopular.
   ``You will never hear that `l' word `liberal' from them,'' he
said. ``They've put on political trench coats and dark glasses and
slipped their platform into a plain brown wrapper.''
   ``While they are saying that government needs to do more of this
or more of that, will they also pledge not to raise taxes?'' he
asked.
   The president challenged the Democrats also to go forward with
the missile defense system known as the strategic defense
initiative or ``Star Wars,'' which he called ``the one practical
way of reducing the threat'' of nuclear weapons.
   ``And while they are talking about the war on drugs, will they
also support the death penalty for drug kingpins?'' he asked.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr., of Arkansas, delivering the Democrats'
response to Reagan's address, said the party's convention
enthusiasm was ``spreading like wildfire across the prairie.''
   ``After eight years of a Republican administration fueled by
selfish and sometimes unlawful motives, the American people are
looking for a return to the basic values of common respect,
compassion and concern for all,'' Anthony said.
   He cited the plight of workers whose plants have been shut down
and farmers who have lost their farms and said Democrats in
Congress have been ``the safety net for the American people.''
   Reagan opened his radio address by saying that ``this week there
was a certain meeting in Atlanta, and maybe, like me, you just
couldn't help hearing a few things about it and shaking your head.''
   ``Some people just don't seem to learn,'' he said. ``The
American people want to hear straight talk about where our leaders
plan to take the country, not personal attacks.''
   ``To hear them talk, you would never have guessed that we are in
the longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' the president
said.
   The Reagans have been at their Rancho del Cielo since Sunday,
enjoying generally sunny and pleasant weather.
   The White House said their son, Ron, and his wife, Doria, had
dinner with the president and his wife on Friday and spent the
night at the ranch.

   A woman faces child abuse charges because of
the ways she punished two sons and a nephew, including taping one
boy's toes ``because he's always wriggling them,'' police said.
   Arraignment was scheduled for Monday on three felony counts of
child abuse against Dorothy Christina Evanovich, 31, said Deputy
District Attorney Stephen A. Baron.
   Ms. Evanovich, described as a transient with no known address,
said she bound the eyes of her 8-year-old nephew, Stephen, with
clear plastic medical tape ``because he kept looking around,'' said
police Detective Susan Livera.
   The woman said she taped Stephen's hands in back and put a
plastic bag over them because the child ``wasn't a good eater,''
and also put a lit cigarette in the boy's nose and mouth, Ms.
Livera said.
   The mother said she taped together the hands of her son,
Nicolas, 7, as if he were praying and put a lamp shade on his head
because he ``likes to stay up at night,'' Ms. Livera said.
   She also taped Nicholas' toes, Ms. Livera added, while the hands
of her 4-year-old son, Anthony, were taped to his side for other
infractions.
   Ms. Evanovich was being held in lieu of $9,000 bail following
her arrest Wednesday at a motel where guests and employees reported
the alleged abuse, Baron said.
   The children were placed in protective custody while Ms.
Evanovich undergoes psychological tests.

<TEXT>
   Two youngsters pulled a prank on their
mom Saturday but it backfired and no one laughed _ especially not
authorities who believed an 8-year-old had been kidnapped.
   The older of the boys, age 12, told their mother his younger
brother was ``picked up by somebody in a red car who took off,''
said Constable Stephen Williamson of the Roxbury Town Police
Department.
   The 12-year-old and his mother approached Williamson's patrol
car and ``both of them were crying,'' the officer said. ``The
mother was hysterical. All the kid told me was that `a car pulled
up and took my little brother.'''
   Williamson alerted the Delaware County Sheriff's Department and
the state police in Oneonta and Margaretville on his radio, then
headed toward Margaretville _ ``because he (the boy) said they went
that way.''
   The sheriff's department, in turn, notified the local radio
station in this small town about 80 miles southwest of Albany.
   ``They wanted us to tell listeners to be on the lookout for a
red car headed to the Roxbury or Margaretville area from Grand
Gorge,'' said Kevin Wright, the disc jockey at station WDLA.
   The station interrupted programming and broadcast the warning on
its AM and FM frequencies at least seven times, said Wright.
   Meanwhile, authorities set up roadblocks and Williamson returned
to question the children's mother. It was then he learned it was
all a joke devised by the children, intended only to scare their
mother.
   The 8-year-old child had been ``in the woods near the home the
whole time and he'd come back (home),'' Williamson said.
   His 12-year-old brother was crying. ``The kid realized what he
did,'' the constable said.
   Williamson refused to release the names of the children or their
mother.
   ``In a way it was sad, but I was glad it wound up being like
that 'cause nobody really was hurt,'' Williamson said. Then he
speculated about what would happen to the 12-year-old boy, saying,
``I think maybe his mother will warm his bottom.''

   Police killed two black men after
they came under fire in a crowd in Natal province, according to a
police report Saturday.
   The daily police unrest report for Friday said 14 men were
arrested at Neamalala after the shooting ended.
   The report said the police had been investigating the deaths of
two men who had been stabbed to death in Zululand township.
   In two other incidents in Natal, at Kwandegezi, near Pinetown,
police said a gunman wounded a member of the security force, and
police found the body of a black man stabbed to death at Mbimbali.
   A group of blacks set a house afire in Mpumalanga, also in
Natal, and a black woman suffered slight burns, police said.
   No further details on any of the events were given. Fighting
between different black political factions in the Natal townships
has been going on for more than a year, with an estimated 500
people killed.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive.

   Three cars of an express passenger train
derailed near this central Italian city Saturday, injuring a

   The derailment was apparently caused by overheated train tracks,
police said.
   The five-car Florence-Foligno train jumped the tracks near
Cannara, about 125 miles north of Rome.
   Two people were treated at the Foligno hospital _ Walter
Pirotta, 48, of Cinisello Balsamo, Italy and Jane Westwell, 20, a
student in Perugia. Her hometown in England was not immediately
available.
   They suffered whiplash and were released shortly after treatment.

   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem
called on Israeli authorities Saturday to ``renounce repressive
measures'' in dealing with the Palestinian uprising.
   Michel Sabbah, a Palestinian, told Vatican Radio: ``Violent
measures used by the Israeli authorities, repressive measures, will
never lead to calm and even less to peace, because violence
encourages violence and an ever stronger resistance.''
   ``What should be done is to try to understand the desires of
these people calling for their rights, to talk with them and above
all to treat them like human beings.''
   The patriarch is the spiritual leader of the 65,000 Latin-rite
Catholics in Israel, the Israeli-occupied territories, Jordan and
Cyprus. Sabbah was the first Arab named to the post.
   The Jerusalem-born priest became patriarch in January, a month
after the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
began. More than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in
the violence.
   ``What can the church do?'' Sabbah asked. ``I don't think the
authorities listen, I don't think many others will listen. I
address myself to the Israeli leaders and call on them to renounce
repressive measures.''
   He also said he feared the violence connected with the uprising
would grow worse since ``it seems that until the elections this
November, authority will rest in the hands of the military and no
politician wants to take any responsibility.''

   Mexican lawmen stalking drug
traffickers mistakenly shot and killed a news anchorwoman, her
mother-in-law and a family friend Saturday, authorities said.
   Police officers mistook the journalist's car for one spotted
near a clandestine airstrip where a plane believed to have been
carrying Colombian cocaine had crashed, the official government
news agency Notimex reported.
   Notimex said federal Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez
ordered an investigation and the detention of the four police
officers involved in the shootings.
   XHIJ-TV said its anchorwoman, Linda Bejarano, 28, was killed
along with Lucresia Martinez de Gomez, 58, and Carlos Alfonso
Garcia, 25.
   Ms. Bejarano's husband, Manuel Gomez, said he was in the car
with the other three when they were shot about 3:30 a.m. near
downtown Juarez, but he was uninjured.
   Gomez, a co-anchor at the station, told reporters later Saturday
that the four were driving near downtown when a car carrying four
men tried to pull them over. He said the men identified themselves
as Federal Judicial Police officers, but that he didn't stop
because he was afraid they would rob him.
   He said he was carrying about $12,000 in cash raised by the TV
station at a circus.
   When Gomez didn't stop, the men started shooting the car with
machine guns. About 40 to 45 bullet holes were found in the car,
officials said.
   Gomez said he was taken in for questioning and then released.
   State Judicial Police Commander Ramon Olivas said a car similar
in description was found later abandoned with 40 kilograms of
cocaine.
   ``The Judicial Police cowardly killed my wife and my mother,''
Gomez said, his voice shaking. ``I hope the police don't hide and
protect these men.''
   Notimex identified the four police officers responsible for the
shootings as Joaquin Garcia Mendez, a federal judicial police
officer, and city police officers Santos Robles Pena, Roberto Gomez
Jilguero and Noel Librado Zavala.
   Federal Judicial Police officials told the TV station in this
border city across from El Paso, Texas, that the gunmen were
``madrinas'' _ uncommissioned officers who often carry guns and act
as surveillance agents.
   XHIJ spokesman Gustavo Aguirre said police told him the officers
were trying to track a similar car that supposedly was laden with
80 kilograms of cocaine when the shootings occurred.
   ``They said it was a mistake,'' Aguirre said. ``That's all they
say. They thought that they (the victims) were narcotics
traffickers because the car was the same type they were looking
for.''
   Carlos Armendariz, spokesman for the Federal Judicial Police,
said the four people involved in the shooting were arrested, and
added: ``These are embarrassing, lamentable deeds that we're not
going to permit, and those responsible will be punished.''
   Aguirre said he did not think the fact that Bejarano was a
journalist had anything to do with the incident. He said Ms.
Bejarano had not been covering any stories on alleged malfeasance
in government.
   Ivan Sanchez, shift commander at Red Cross Hospital, told Juarez
daily El Mexicano that several men drove up to the hospital about 6
a.m., identified themselves as Federal Judicial Police agents, left
the three bodies on the parking lot and drove away.
   In addition to anchoring news shows, Ms. Bejarano had her own
Saturday evening news program called ``Columnas Semanal,'' Weekly
Column. She taped the last show at 6 p.m. Friday, and before
Saturday's airing, a woman on the brink of tears appeared on the
television and read a letter from the management of the station.
   ``It's lamentable that she lost her life by mistake,'' the
unidentified woman read, her voice trembling. ``We hope the
Judicial Police seek justice.... We _ all of us at Channel 44 _
feel much pain tonight.''
   She said Ms. Bejarano was three months pregnant. She had two
daughters, Alejandra, 6, and Carla, 4.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kirov Ballet received rave reviews on
its first visit to Ireland as part of the celebration of Dublin's
1,000th birthday.
   The Soviet company's six-day tour, which ended Saturday,
featured the European premiere of a new production of ``Swan Lake''
by Kirov director Oleg Vinogradov.
   Under the headline ``A Production of Perfection,'' the Irish
Independent newspaper's dance critic Mary MacGoris wrote, ``The
magic of `Swan Lake' cast a sustained spell ... the dancing was
magnificent.''
   Reviewer Carolyn Swift of The Irish Times called the production
``the closest to perfect I have ever seen.''
   The 3,500-seat Simmonscourt exhibition hall at the Royal Dublin
Society was sold out for the Kirov's seven performances.
   Top price for tickets was 50 Irish pounds ($75). A jarring note
was the heat in the building, which does not have air conditioning.
   Many of the 200 members of the Kirov Ballet attended a
performance at Dublin's Gaiety theater and went to see the movie
``Crocodile Dundee'' during breaks from rehearsals before Monday's
opening performance. They also went shopping.
   The company goes to London Monday.

   A newborn baby was in fair condition
Saturday after doctors in Minnesota reattached two fingers severed
during a Caesarean section at a North Dakota hospital, officials
said.
   A surgeon at Trinity Medical Center in Minot, N.D., was making
an incision with a disposable surgical stapler when he accidentally
cut off the tips of the baby's index and middle fingers, hospital
President Terry Hoff said Saturday.
   About a quarter-inch of each of the two fingers was cut off
during the Friday surgery but the joints were unaffected, he said.
Surgical staplers cut and staple at the same time, Hoff said. The
North Dakota hospital's president said the instrument appears not
to have malfunctioned.
   Kristen Meckle, daughter of Ted and Diane Meckle, was flown to
North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale for reattachment
surgery later Friday, said North Memorial spokeswoman Karen
Knepper. The medical center has been the site of previous
successful reattachments.
   Knepper said the baby was in ``very critical'' condition when
she arrived Friday night, but her condition improved after the
surgery.
   ``The prognosis for keeping her fingers is good,'' Knepper said.
   Hoff would not release the name of the surgeon who performed the
Caesarean section.
   He said no formal investigation will be made, but hospital staff
members and doctors who handle what he called quality assurance
will look into the incident.
   Knepper said the baby will remain at North Memorial eight to 10
days.

   Lee LeBlanc, who became a leading
wildlife artist and a winner of the prestigious federal duck stamp
competition after retiring from a career at several Hollywood
studios, died Thursday at 74.
   LeBlanc, who lived in Iron County, Mich., since his retirement
in 1962, died at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis.
   From 1972 on, he designed stamps for wildlife and fishing
licenses in several states and Canada. He won the prestigious
federal duck stamp competition for 1973-74 with his painting of a
pair of Stellar's eiders.
   He also drew illustrations for such things as greeting cards and
children's books on wildlife.
   Born Oct. 5, 1913, in Powers, LeBlanc attended art schools in
Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York before joining the staff of
Walt Disney.
   He later held administrative positions at 20th Century Fox and
MGM studios until his retirement.

   John C. Burchard, who made headlines
for trying to fly an airplane with no experience in 1930, died in a
car crash Monday. He was 89.
   The electronics engineer tried his hand at flying in a small
plane in Chicago in June 1930, even though he had never been in one
before.
   After takeoff, he found himself in the air upside down with
gasoline dripping over his nose, hanging by his seat belt. He
managed to land in a pasture _ still upside down _ and walked away
with only a bump on his head.
   Burchard later took flying lessons, and received his pilot's
license in 1943. He continued flying until shortly before his
death.

   A bus driver was charged with possession
of drug paraphernalia Saturday night after the bus she was driving
went off the Garden State Parkway, injuring all 42 passengers, two
of them seriously, and tying up traffic for hours, state police
said.
   The Gray Lines tour bus, transporting a church group from New
York City to Atlantic City, went off the road and into some trees
Saturday afternoon, said state police Sgt. Stacy Cranmer.
   State police did not know the name of the church.
   The driver, Annette Smalls, 29, of Newark, N.J., was questioned
after she underwent blood and urine tests at Shore Memorial
Hospital in Somers Point, N.J., said state Trooper Michael Kaiser.
Test results will not be known for several days, he said.
   Kaiser said additional charges against Ms. Smalls, who was being
held at the Bass River state police station late Saturday night,
were pending. He declined to specify the paraphernalia involved. No
other arrests were made.
   An investigation was continuing into the accident's cause, which
occurred after rain had dampened the road, Kaiser said.
   Helene Kennedy, a nursing supervisor at the mainland division of
the Atlantic City Medical Center, said 21 passengers were brought
to the hospital.
   One person was in critical condition and another in serious
condition Saturday night, Ms. Kennedy said, adding their names were
being withheld until after notification of their families.
   The remaining passengers were treated and released, she said.
   Twelve passengers were taken to the Atlantic City Medical
Center's city division and were treated and released with minor
cuts and bruises, another nursing supervisor said.
   A nursing supervisor at Shore Memorial said nine people were
brought to the hospital. They also were treated and released with
minor injuries.
   The accident caused traffic back-ups of up to five miles in the
southbound lanes for several hours as vehicles were restricted to
one lane, Cranmer said.

   Authorities warned thousands of

   About 5,000 bikers were expected at the party on Vancouver
Island off Canada's Pacific coast. Last year's gathering of about
2,000 enthusiasts drew local complaints about noisy motorcycles.
   About 150 leaders of the bikers' group Hell's Angels gathered in
the island town of Nanaimo Friday for a weekend convention before
the party, said police spokesman Bob Stitt.
   ``We're having extra patrols to let them and the public know

<HEAD>Panda Ling-Ling May Be Pregnant Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ling-Ling, the nation's famed female giant
panda, may be pregnant again, a zoo spokesman said Saturday.
   Laboratory tests show the same hormonal pattern that was
observed when Ling-Ling was pregnant last year, said zoo spokesman
Mike Morgan.
   ``A lot of people are feeling positive, but no one will say for
certainty that Ling-Ling is pregnant,'' he said. ``There are
reservations.''
   If she is pregnant, she probably would give birth during the
last couple of days of July or the first week of August, he said.
She has given birth to four cubs at the zoo, all of which have died.
   Ling-Ling and her panda partner, Hsing-Hsing, the star
attractions at the National Zoo, mated three consecutive days
during the second week of April, he said.
   A sophisticated lab analysis of her urine shows the same pattern
of hormonal changes as scientists observed last year when she was
pregnant, which ``has led a lot of people around the zoo to believe
the panda is pregnant,'' Morgan said.
   ``But the people familiar with the analysis are telling people
that although the pattern is there, there is a lot of room for
error because we have only one accurate predecessor of this year's
results'' and a false pregnancy could produce the same results, he
said.
   However, Morgan said, ``We're proceeding like she is pregnant.
We've installed a sophisticated TV monitoring system and have
around-the-clock volunteers'' watching for any signs of impending
birth.
   ``We don't want to do anything to upset the panda,'' he said.
``We want business as usual as much as possible.''

   A 600-pound boulder slipped off a
mountain outcrop, crashed 1,400 feet down a steep incline and
smashed into a house Saturday, killing a sleeping child, state
police said.
   ``It was out of the blue, an act of God,'' said state police
Sgt. C.E. Berlin, Jr.
   The 3-foot-wide rock crashed through the outside wall of Ronald
Marcum's house and went through a closet and another wall and into
the bedroom of Marcum's sleeping 15-month-old child, Berlin said.
   The rock hit the infant, whose name was not released, and
continued through two more walls and another bedroom before rolling
to a standstill, Berlin said.
   ``If it was another four or five feet to one side, it would have
missed the house and just rolled onto U.S. 52,'' he said.
   The child's parents were at home at the time of the 4:15 p.m.
accident.
   Berlin said there was no mine blasting in the area and no
indication of anything that would have triggered the rockfall.
   ``It just came off the top of the mountain,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Producers and striking scriptwriters resumed
talks Saturday for the first time in more than a month, and both
sides immediately agreed to a news blackout.
   A federal mediator ordered negotiators for the Writers Guild of
America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
back to the bargaining table. The 5-month-old walkout has crippled
TV and movie production.
   Mediator Leonard Farrell can convene meetings but lacks the
authority to arbitrate the dispute. He asked for the news blackout
at the start of Saturday's meeting at alliance headquarters in
Sherman Oaks, said Martin Waldman, spokesman for the 9,000-member
guild. The news blackout extends for the duration of the resumed
negotiating sessions, Waldman said.
   ``Something historic is happening upstairs. I think there is
finally the opportunity to make a deal,'' George Kirgo, head of the
union's West Coast branch, said before Saturday's meeting. ``I have
true high hopes for the first time in a long time that we can make
some sense at this table and that it can come to an end this
weekend.''
   But alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the producers had
nothing new to offer.
   ``All of the ingredients for a deal are on the table and they
have been for several weeks,'' said Steinberg. ``We are going to
sit and listen. That is our posture for this meeting.''
   Previous talks ended in June with scriptwriters overwhelmingly
rejecting an offer from producers.
   The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns
of one-hour domestic shows and a bigger share in the increased
foreign market.

   Bond was denied Saturday to a man charged
with the beating death of a minister who had just returned from the
Democratic National Convention, authorities said.
   The Rev. Robert Wesby, a prominent civil rights activist in this
community, had gone to Atlanta to support Jesse Jackson, the
unsuccessful presidential candidate.
   Wesby, 61, was a ``good friend down through the years, an
honorable man,'' Jackson said Saturday.
   ``We regret so much that this good man was killed and we hope
that those who were involved will face swift justice,'' Jackson
said.
   Wesby was beaten to death Friday near the altar of his
Progressive Baptist Church, about 35 miles west of Chicago. Acting
on a tip, police arrested Calvin Green, 28, of Aurora and charged
him with first-degree murder.
   Kane County Circuit Judge Peter Grometer ordered Green held
without bond, said police Sgt. Ron Martin.
   Martin would not comment on whether police knew of a possible
motive for the slaying. Church members said Green was a street
preacher in the area.
   County Coroner Mary Lou Kearns said Wesby was killed with a
``very sharp, heavy instrument.'' No murder weapon was found at the
scene, police said.
   Kearns said wounds on Wesby's left arm indicated he tried to
defend himself.
   Wesby founded his church 25 years ago. Since 1972, he also led
the Aurora branch of Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil rights
organization founded by Jackson.
   He was a follower of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
participated in the famous 1965 march from Selma, Ala., to
Montgomery, Ala.

Sale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said
Saturday it has begun allowing AIDS patients to import treatment
drugs that have not been approved for sale in the United States.
   Speaking to a hostile crowd at a conference on gay and lesbian
health issues, FDA Commissioner Frank Young unexpectedly announced
that the government last Wednesday officially began allowing the
import of some unapproved treatments for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``All of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce,'' Young
told a crowd of about 300 people who heckled him throughout his
speech.
   Under the terms of the new policy, AIDS patients can import
drugs from other countries if the product is purchased for personal
use and not for sale, Young said. The FDA maintains the right to
deny any drug shipments into the country.
   Young said the FDA was moved to change its policy in part to
control the shipment of AIDS treatments because some drugs have
been imported illegally.
   He said some of the drugs have been shown to have applications
to help combat the disease, which is caused by a virus that damages
the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections
and cancer.
   Young defended the FDA's record, saying the agency had worked
hard to gain approval for the drug AZT, which federal government
scientists consider the most promising treatment developed to date
to prolong the lives of those with the virus. He said federal money
and personnel devoted to AIDS have increased dramatically.
   Despite the announcement, protesters charged the government with
failing to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat AIDS
victims.
   ``He announced the policy because he heard there were going to
be protests and he wanted to placate us,'' said Debbie Levine of
the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. ``But we're not
going to be placated with just dribs and drabs.''
   The demonstrators, most of the crowd attending the speech at the
10th National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum,
held aloft watches with alarms ringing to illustrate that people
with AIDS cannot wait while drugs are put through years of testing
before use.
   Levine said several drug treatments for AIDS being used in
Europe, Japan and elsewhere have been proven to be effective and
should be legalized in the United States.
   ``We've had other epidemics such as toxic-shock syndrome and
Legionnaires' disease which have been addressed swiftly,'' said
Alan Klein of ACT-UP. ``But after eight years, the commissioner of
the FDA is still talking about hope and we only have one drug
(AZT), which is highly toxic.''
   Young said he wanted the meeting at the conference to mark the
beginning of an effort to ``build bridges'' between federal
regulators and AIDS activists.
   ``The FDA shares your concern for the individuals who are
suffering from this devastating disease and (is) painfully aware of
their desperate efforts to seek treatment,'' Young said over
protesters' shouts, which often drowned out his speech.
   ``No higher priority exists for us than to work together to
alleviate their suffering,'' he said. ``The FDA shares your
frustration on the lack of effective therapies available, but we
also know that research is providing many new candidates, some of
which will be successful.''
   As of June 15, the FDA had approved 178 applications for testing
of drugs and other therapies to treat AIDS, Young said.
   Later Saturday, U.S. Reps. Barney Frank and Gerry Studds, two
Massachusetts Democrats who are openly gay, were presented awards
from both the National Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation and the
Association of Physicians for Human Rights for their work on behalf
of the gay community and to combat AIDS.
   Frank urged conferees to vote in the upcoming election. ``We
have a country that is not informed about AIDS and what we can do
about it. Part of it is due to a failure of political will and
partly it is due to the failure of the executive branch,'' he said.
   ``We would have more money for health issues if it weren't for
increased defense spending,'' said Frank, who received three
standing ovations.
   Studds criticized the Reagan administration's response to AIDS.
``This president seems to think the answer to this disease is
monogamy and marriage,'' he said.
   Other speakers included Cheryl Crane, the openly lesbian
daughter of actress Lana Turner, and Broadway actress Elaine
Stritch.
   About 1,500 homosexual men and women are attending the weeklong
conference, which ends Tuesday.
   Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the
68,220 U.S. AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981.
There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of the total cases,
the Centers for Disease Control reported last week.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Workers with spades, wheelbarrows and
trucks began removing heaps of garbage from New Delhi's slum areas
Saturday as officials reported 14 more deaths from cholera and
intestinal infections.
   The death toll from this month's outbreak is now at least 118,
and a city health spokesman said Saturday hospitals had admitted 70
more patients with cholera and other intestinal diseases.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who visited the affected districts
Friday, has given the municipal sanitation department a deadline of
three days to clean clogged drains and garbage dumps and spray
pesticides over stagnant water.
   He accused city administrators and health officers of not doing
enough to combat the epidemic.
   The health department spokesman, who spoke with the condition he
not be identified, said 103,684 people have been inoculated in the
disease-stricken zones.
   Trucks were collecting garbage and crews cleared the overworked
drainage system.
   The onset of the monsoon rains in early July resulted in clogged
drains in districts with inadequate sanitation facilities.
   Health officials blame the cholera outbreak on the contamination
of wells by rainwater flowing through garbage and sewage.
   More than 9,140 people have sought treatment at hospitals this
month for cholera and gastroenteritis, according to official
figures. That is more than four times the number of such cases
registered in all of July last year.
   Outbreaks of cholera and gastroenteritis also have occurred in
northern Uttar Pradesh and Punjab states claiming 62 lives,
according to news reports.

   Cambodian leader Hun Sen thanked
Vietnam and Indonesia Saturday for their efforts to find a peace
formula for his country and said success also depends on rebels
fighting his government.
   He made the remarks as he joined delegates from Vietnam and the
Cambodian resistance alliance for the first such talks since
Vietnam invaded Cambodia nearly 10 years ago. The talks are
scheduled to begin Monday.
   Hun Sen described the first informal meeting Saturday as a
result of the initiative of Indonesia and Vietnam.
   ``We appreciate the efforts to solve the Cambodian problem. We
will endeavor to make the `cocktail party' a success. But it also
depends on the other side,'' he said.
   Delegates were calling Saturday's meeting a cocktail party.
   Meanwhile, former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
arrived for a six-day visit as guest of Indonesian President
Suharto.
   The prince was not scheduled to attend talks between the three
guerrilla factions and government scheduled to be held at the
presidential palace in Bogor. The mountain retreat is about 40
miles south of Jakarta.
   Sihanouk resigned as president of the guerrilla coalition, which
includes his followers, anti-communists and the radical Khmer
Rouge, on July 11. He has said he will be represented at the talks
by his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
   Other delegates arriving Saturday included Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach and Laotian acting Foreign Minister
Thongsavath Khaikham-Phithoune.
   The Vietnamese official told reporters, ``I express my firm
belief that the `cocktail party' will be successful because of the
courage and wisdom of Indonesia.''
   In the meeting with Suharto, Sihanouk expressed hope for the
success of the talks, presidential spokesman Moerdiono said.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney on Friday
criticized as unfair a U.S. decision to impose economic sanctions
on Brazil for refusing to recognize patents for foreign
pharmaceutical products.
   President Reagan started a process Friday that will lead to
sanctions on $200 million worth of yet unspecified Brazilian goods.
The United States is the No. 1 market for Brazilian exports.
   Sarney issued a communique calling the decision ``unfair and
discriminatory.'' He said it ``violates the most elementary
principles of international law and the GATT,'' referring to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based body that
promotes fair trade practices.
   Sarney said the U.S. government was caving in to the special
interests of the American pharmaceutical industry and warned the
action ``tends to undermine bilateral trade relations.''
   The United States claims American drug companies lose about $36
million a year because Brazil permits unauthorized copies of
pharmaceutical products and formulas.
   Sarney denied that U.S. companies were being jeopardized. He
said 85 percent of the Brazilian drug industry is foreign-owned and
that American companies were the market leaders with a 35 percent
share.
   He added that Brazil may demand reparations under GATT
provisions for damages caused by the sanctions.
   The sale of medical drugs in Brazil totaled $1.1 billion in
1987, according to the Brazilian Pharmaceutical Industry
Association. About 73 percent of that total was by foreign-owned
multinationals.
   Of the 500 pharmaceutical companies in Brazil, 69 are
foreign-owned, the association said.
   The U.S. decision had been expected by the drug industry in
Brazil, said Jorge Raimundo, president of the Anglo-American
Pharmaceutical Industry Chamber.
   ``Only the government didn't see it coming. Brazil has not shown
any willingness to negotiate,'' Raimundo said in a telephone
interview.
   Raimundo, who also is an executive of the Brazilian subsidiary
of the British-owned Glaxo drug company, said the sanctions would
immediately hurt Brazilian exports.
   ``It already is having an effect. The American importer and the
Brazilian exporter don't know what products will be on the list, so
trade stalls,'' he said.
   The United States came close to slapping $105 million in trade
sanctions on Brazil earlier this year, but backed away in March
when that country responded to complaints about its policies
regarding importation of software products.

   Authorities Friday pulled three bodies from
the drainage canal where a DC-6 cargo plane crashed Wednesday
night, and investigators continued their inspection of the crash
site.
   The plane went down near the Golden Meadow community in
Lafourche Parish, about 40 miles south of New Orleans. The
Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office withheld the identities of the
three crash victims Friday, saying only that they were from the
Miami area.
   The four-engine, propeller driven aircraft belonged to Universal
Air Equipment Leasing Inc. of Miami and was operated by Fiorelli
Crews of Miami, according to a news release from TACA Airlines,
which had chartered the flight to carry 22,000 pounds of
handicrafts, seafood and other cargo.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators have not
determined the cause of the crash, but an FAA controller who asked
not to be identified has said the plane's pilot reported he was
short of fuel and would be unable to reach New Orleans.
   There were believed to be only three crewmen aboard the plane.

<HEAD>Military Court Will Investigate Alleged Improprieties In Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's highest military court said
Friday it would take over the investigation of alleged
improprieties in the decision that freed Navy heart surgeon Donald
Billig.
   Billig, convicted in 1986 on three charges of killing three
surgical patients through incompetence, was freed in April by the
Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review on the grounds the
evidence against him was not enough for a criminal conviction.
   The inspector general of the Defense Department, June Gibbs
Brown, in late June began an investigation of an anonymous
telephone tip that bribery and improper conversations with the
reviewing judges were involved in the decision to release Billig.
   She secured an order from the Judge Advocate General of the
Navy, Rear Adm. Hugh D. Campbell, to Edward M. Byrne, chief judge
of the reviewing court, for the seven judges to submit to
interviews.
   Byrne and his colleagues won an order from the U.S. Court of
Military Appeals against proceeding while it considered whether the
inspector general could conduct such an inquiry. They argued that
they were placed in an impossible position _ if they refused an
order, they could be court-martialed and if convicted sent to
prison; if they did not refuse, the public would lose confidence in
the secrecy of discussions among judges.
   The appeals court on Friday ordered that one of its members,
Walter T. Cox III, a former member of judicial investigation
commissions in South Carolina, to serve as a special master, to
supervise the investigation, ruling on all requests for interviews
or documents from the inspector general.
   Cox also ``shall have full power and authority to receive,
consider and independently investigate any allegations of judicial
misconduct'' if he finds good cause to do so, making
recommendations to the full appeals court on what he finds.
   Patrick Carome, appointed by the appeals court to represent the
reviewing judges, said that was ``an invitation to the inspector
general'' to detail her evidence, if any, to Cox.

   New attacks blamed on Sikh militants
killed 19 people in northern Punjab state, a news agency reported
Friday.
   The violence followed a bombing Tuesday near the holiest Sikh
shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, that killed at least 29
people and injured more than 40. Sikh radicals were also blamed for
that attack.
   The latest killings raised to at least 1,552 the toll in Punjab
this year blamed on Sikh militants fighting for an independent
homeland.
   In one attack, five Nihangs, members of a Sikh fundamentalist
sect, were shot to death on a highway about 20 miles from Amritsar,
the United News of India agency said.
   In a nearby village, three Sikhs, including two women, were
killed.
   UNI did not say when the attacks occurred and gave no details.
   Militant Sikhs are often blamed for slaying moderates who oppose
their calls for independence.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million people but
constitute a majority in Punjab.
   Radical Sikhs have been campaigning for a separate homeland
since 1982. They claim they are discriminated against by Hindus,
who make up 80 percent of the population.
   The Sikh religion was created 500 years ago as an alternative to
Hinduism and Islam.

   Cuba canceled visas of a U.S. congressional
delegation to express its objections to a meeting between American
diplomats and Cuban dissidents, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina
reported Friday from Havana.
   It said the Foreign Ministry issued a statement charging, ``The
July 15 meeting was organized to make it possible for American
diplomats to instruct their counterrevolutionary servants and was
not a normal diplomatic activity.'' Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla., chairman
of a House foreign affairs subcommittee, was to travel to Cuba with
several aides to inspect U.S. diplomatic facilities. The United
States maintains no formal diplomatic ties with the communist
Caribbean nation, but has a Special Interest Section in Havana.
   Cuba revoked the visas Tuesday night.
   Mica wrote to President Fidel Castro expressing ``shock'' and
``astonishment'' over Cuba's decision. Mica's letter was dated
Thursday and released Friday.
   The Havana government statement said the July 15 meeting
represented interference in Cuba's internal affairs and called the
gathering ``a gross provocation.''
   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, quoted the ministry as
saying the meeting was held at the home of an American diplomat in
Cuba ``with a score of former counterrevolutionary prisoners and
other enemies of our process.''
   It said the Cubans were advised how to act during a visit to
Cuba by a delegation of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, planned
later this summer.
   Mica wrote, ``If the mere fact that members of the Cuban
Committee on Human Rights attended a party results in punitive
action against the United States, one can hardly imagine that the
Cuban people would feel free to meet and provide information to
representatives of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.''
   He called on Castro to make it clear to the people of Cuba that
they are free to speak openly to the commission members.

   A sheet of steel estimated to weigh 1,000
pounds fell on a construction worker and pinned him, but other
workers got him out of the tight squeeze and he suffered only minor
injuries.
   ``I couldn't breathe under there,'' Thomas Bittner of Wausau
said Friday. ``I'm lucky I had enough guys there to get me out.''
   ``I was squashed. All I wanted was to get this thing off of
me,'' he said.
   Bittner, 35, was working on a fence being erected Thursday at
Wausau Steel Corp. when a hook connecting a section of fence to a
crane came loose and the section fell on him, the Marathon County
Sheriff's Department reported.
   The sheet of quarter-inch thick steel, roughly seven feet wide
and 30 feet long piece, pinned Bittner on top of scrap metal, said
David Pagel, safety director in the Marathon County Sheriff's
Department.
   Workers freed him before firefighters arrived, the fire
department said.
   ``I was working with about four or five other guys. They lifted
the corner of the plate and got me out,'' Bittner said.
   ``I'm just glad people were there to help,'' he said.
   Peter Wallach, president of Wausau Steel, said Bittner was
helping an outside crew putting up the fence when the accident
happened. ``I just figured we were all ... lucky that he didn't
even have a broken bone,'' Wallach said.
   Bittner, who was wearing a welding helmet when the fence section
fell, was treated for minor injuries to his head, chest and elbow
at Wausau Hospital Center and released, officials said. He also
needed stitches for a cut behind one ear.
   Bittner and the other workers estimated the sheet of metal
weighed about 1,000 pounds.
   ``I guess anything over 100 pounds doesn't feel so great,''
Bittner said.

   Angola's rebels said Friday they killed
more than 37 soldiers in four attacks this week. Their claim came
two days after Marxist Angola formally accepted a pact calling for
removal of foreign troops.
   Rebels of UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, also said they also captured two soldiers.
   They gave rebel casualties as four killed and nine wounded.
   The rebels gave no details, and there was no independent
confirmation of their claims, made in a statement distributed in
this Portuguese capital.
   South Africa, Angola and Cuba formally accepted a U.S.-brokered
agreement Wednesday aimed at getting foreign troops out of Angola
and granting independence to bordering South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   Cuban troops in Angola help the government fight the rebels,
while South African troops are in southern Angola to bolster UNITA
forces.
   South Africa controls South-West Africa and joins Washington in
backing the Angolan rebels.
   The rebels were not a party to the agreement, which gave no
specific timetable for withdrawal.
   Angola's guerrillas have been fighting since 1975 to force the
government to share power.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge listened to more than two
hours of legal arguments Friday, then delayed ruling on a news
media request to unseal documents in a major investigation of
suspected fraud in military contracts.
   ``It seems to me there is just no way to properly render a
decision from the bench,'' U.S. District Court Judge David Kenyon
said.
   He said he had not received complete copies of the documents
sought until Friday and wanted to study them before ruling and
added: ``I'm not at all sure what decision will be rendered.''
   The request pending in Los Angeles is one of a number of similar
efforts by news organizations to see affidavits related to the
coast-to-coast probe of the relationship between defense industry
consultants, Pentagon officials and weapons manufacturers.
   Before leaving the bench, Kenyon asked government prosecutors
how long they planned to keep the material sealed if he ruled in
their favor. Prosecutors had asked Kenyon to overturn a decision by
U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann, who ruled last week that the
public has a right to see the documents now.
   ``I can't give you a date, but I hope it would be reasonably
soon,'' responded U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner. He said it would be
released when the government no longer feared harm to its
investigation.
   But attorney Rex Heincke, representing the Los Angeles Times,
argued the government failed to show that any harm could come from
documents in an investigation that is already in headlines.
   ``Anyone who is going to destroy evidence has done it by now,''
he said.
   Attorneys for the Los Angeles Times, Copley Newspapers, NBC and
CBS sought release of the documents detailing searches at the
offices of Litton Industries, Teledyne Electronics and Northrop
Corp., and the Los Angeles home of consultant Fred Lackner.
   The most vehement opposition to unsealing the documents came
from a battery of attorneys representing unnamed employees of
companies mentioned as targets of the probe. They argued that the
reputations of these clients, referred to as ``Mr. X,'' would be
harmed by a mention in the documents, even if they are never
charged with a crime.
   ``It would be totally destructive of these individuals to unseal
the affidavits,'' said attorney George O'Connell.
   Among the newspapers seek release of similar documents are The
Washington Times; The Washington Post; St. Louis Post-Dispatch;
Newsday, published in Long Island, N.Y., and New York City; the St.
Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch; the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis; and The Hartford (Conn.) Courant.
   In Minneapolis on Friday, a federal magistrate took under
advisement a request to see documents allowing a search of Unisys
Corp. offices in Minnesota.
   Patrick Schiltz, lawyer for the Star Tribune, told U.S.
Magistrate Earl Cudd that keeping the search warrants and
affidavits sealed is pointless because ``any reasonably informed
observer'' could make a good guess as to what is involved in the
investigation, simply by reading newspapers.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Anderson told the magistrate
the fact the information was printed in newspapers ``doesn't make
it accurate.''
   On Thursday, The Hartford Courant filed a motion seeking
documents related to the search of Pratt & Whitney offices in
Washington, D.C. Earlier in the week, the newspaper had asked a
federal judge to unseal affidavits related to the search of three
Connecticut offices of Norden Systems and the home of a Norden vice
president.
   Both Pratt & Whitney and Norden Systems are divisions of
Hartford-based United Technologies Corp., Connecticut's largest
private employer.

   A Canadian provincial court in a landmark ruling
on Friday rejected an Edmonton man's bid to prevent his former
girlfriend from having an abortion.
   But Justice Joanne Viet of Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
acknowledged the rights of a father of an unborn child by ruling
that Randy Mock, 25, could sue 18-year-old Michelle Brandanburg for
damages.
   Mock obtained a temporary injunction to prevent Ms. Brandanburg
from proceeding with the abortion, but that injunction expired on
Thursday.
   When it did, Ms. Brandanburg's lawyer told reporters, her client
went to the United States and got an abortion.
   ``It's devastating,'' said Mock, who had claimed father's rights
and wanted to raise the child on his own.
   He said he would pursue the case for damages. ``I've come this
far ... I've just lost my child and it's not going to die in vain.''
   The decision came as Parliament wrestled with the abortion issue
following a controversial Supreme Court decision last January,
striking down Canada's restrictive abortion law.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government said
debate will begin next week on compromise legislation that would
permit easy access to abortions early in a pregnancy but impose
restrictions in later stages.
   Anti-abortion and pro-choice groups had used the Edmonton case
to back their arguments, and both sides claimed victory.
   ``Every step along the way in cases like this are important for
women,'' said defense attorney Donna Oliver Dyck, who represented
Ms. Brandanburg and argued that a woman should have control of her
own body.
   Mock's lawyer, Rosanna Saccomani, said the judge acknowledged
the merits of her client's case by saying he had the right to sue
for damages.
   Ms. Saccomani told the court the couple lived together 18 months
and had a verbal agreement as a common-law couple last February to
stop using contraceptives so they could have a child.
   ``There was an intention to create a child ... that was what the
parties wanted. She should continue with her obligations.''
   She said the relationship broke up in June because of opposition
from Ms. Brandanburg's family. By then, Ms. Brandanburg was
pregnant. Her lawyer argued that Mock's request for a permanent
injunction to prevent the abortion was ``ludicrous'' since he had
no rights as the father of an unborn child.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor offered prayers and
New York Mayor Edward Koch talked politics Friday as 1,000
Americans gathered in this land of fog and bog on a pilgrimage for
peace in Northern Ireland.
   ``I hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim. I hope to do nothing
but pray,'' O'Connor said at an airport ceremony, explaining why he
would not delve into political specifics.
   The cardinal, the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, said he
was visiting Ireland in ``a totally non-political,
non-ambassadorial position. ... The only contact we want to make is
with God.''
   The allusion was to his lack of meetings over the issue of
Northern Ireland.
   Koch, a self-described ``Jewish soldier in the cardinal's
army,'' was less reticent.
   He repeated his belief that the British should eventually leave
Northern Ireland and said the British should release a government
report on police violence against nationalists in the province.
   The mayor said that by not releasing the report, compiled by
veteran investigator John Stalker, the British government ``loses
any credibility for the future ... and that means that there's even
more bitterness.''
   At Knock, Koch joined the pilgrims and embraced O'Connor, who
kidded him, ``You're all over the papers'' _ a reference to a
photograph of Koch pouring a pint of ale in a Dublin pub.
   The pilgrims gathered at the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock, which
commemorates the evening of Aug. 21, 1879, when 15 people said they
saw a vision of Mary, mother of Jesus.
   The apparition was a rare sign of hope in a region that had been
devastated by famine and emigration. The shrine's success as a
tourist destination was ensured when Pope John Paul II visited it
in 1979.
   Knock is still a village of less than 400 people, but now it
boasts three hotels and as many policemen, more than a dozen pubs,
and an airport with an 8,000-foot-long runway.
   Despite a turnout that was lower than expected _ the basilica in
Knock was only half filled for his first Mass in Ireland _ O'Connor
said he was not concerned.
   ``Not only am I not disappointed, I am overjoyed by the number
that did come,'' O'Connor said.
   In a conclusion to his sermon, O'Connor said: ``This is the
beginning of a series of pilgrimages that will captivate the world.
... All hearts, all minds will turn toward the sufferings in
Northern Ireland.''
   The mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to push
the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it
with the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist
state. The IRA is outlawed on both sides of the border. Its legal
political wing is Sinn Fein.
   The Protestant-Catholic ratio in Northern Ireland is 3-2,
according to its Fair Employment Agency.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan on Friday that Japan's alliance with the
West blocks return of four disputed islands, a Japanese official
said.
   The Soviet leader reiterated the Kremlin's long-standing
position on the islands, under Soviet control since World War II.
His stance allowed no progress on what Tokyo considers the main
obstacle to improved relations with Moscow, the Japanese official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet Union occupied four islands off northern Japan at the
end of World War II. The dispute over ownership of the territory
has prevented the two nations from concluding a peace treaty for 43
years.
   Nakasone told Gorbachev some of the area was occupied illegally
by former dictator Josef V. Stalin. Nakasone argued that, as part
of the current Soviet drive to acknowledge and correct past wrongs
committed by Stalin, the territory should be returned to Japan, the
Japanese official said.
   In a 1956 joint declaration between the two nations, the Soviet
government announced its willingness to return two of the islands
upon conclusion of a peace treaty to officially note the end of
World War II.
   However, Gorbachev reminded Nakasone that the Kremlin amended
that position in 1960 ``because Japan decided to conclude a new
security arrangement with the United States,'' the official said,
paraphrasing Gorbachev.
   He reported that despite the impasse on the issue, Nakasone was
pleased with the visit that began here Wednesday. Nakasone was due
to leave Monday and return directly to Moscow.
   ``We didn't find anything particularly new in the messages sent
by the Soviet side,'' said the government official, who was present
at the meeting between Gorbachev and Nakasone. ``But what was more
interesting was the extent to which we were able to get our message
across to the Soviet side.''
   Nakasone left the office of prime minister late last year but
has been considered during the Soviet visit as an envoy of his
successor, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Japan officially
considers Nakasone's visit private, though he belongs to the Diet,
or Parliament.
   The Japanese official contrasted what he described as a new
Soviet receptiveness with conditions four years ago, when all
mention of the disputed islands was censored from Japanese speeches
carried by Soviet media.
   The official said Nakasone and Gorbachev expressed mutual
interest in improving relations between their countries but that no
specific agreements were concluded during the visit.

   A heat wave and a drought that is ravaging much
of central China is drying rivers, destroying crops and threatening
the water supply of China's biggest city, Shanghai, newspapers
reported Friday.
   The Liberation Daily (Jiefang Ribao) said water consumption in
Shanghai has been near an all-time high since the beginning of July.
   Temperatures have hovered around 100 degrees and little rain has
fallen.
   Nearly 500 heat-related deaths have been reported during the
last month in central China. Most of the deaths have been
concentrated around the Yangtze River basin.
   Vice Mayor Ni Tianzeng was quoted as saying that chemicals used
in purifying water would last only five days and that he sent an
emergency request to other provinces for such chemicals.
   In Hubei province, the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) reported
that 90 percent of middle-sized and smaller rivers had ceased to
flow.
   It said that in the province's northern Yunyang district 90
percent of the corn crop died.
   The China Youth News (Zhongguo Qingnian Bao) reported that in
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, one third of the city's 3 million
people were not certain of getting their daily minimum of water.
   ``There is no water in many buildings higher than four stories.
In some buildings built on high ground, there is no water in the
daytime and many people get up at midnight to store water for
daytime use,'' the paper said.

   British union leaders fumed Friday as the famed
luxury liner Queen Elizabeth II was shipped back abroad to be made
shipshape.
   ``This could have been avoided if the work had gone to a British
shipyard in the first place,'' said Alex Ferry, general secretary
of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.
   The ocean liner, also known as the QE2, will get a new propeller
system in West Germany, where it underwent a costly refitting last
year.
   Cunard Steam-Ship Co. PLC, the liner's owner, faced protests
last year when it gave the $190 million refit contract to the Lloyd
Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, West Germany. The shipping firm said
no British shipyard would accept the six-month deadline with
penalties reported at $1.7 million a day.
   A Cunard official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday the work performed by Lloyd Werft, primarily to install new
diesel engines, had been excellent.
   However, he said problems arose involving a fuel-saving type of
propeller installed at the company's request. He said the device
had never been tried before on a passenger ship.
   The propeller will be replaced with a traditional type at a cost
of $3.4 million, under a guarantee by Lloyd Werft, the spokesman
said.
   However, Ferry laid the problems to cost-cutting wars.
   ``Countries are undercutting each other because of the market,
and this has led directly to work being done to time and price at
the expense of good quality workmanship,'' he said.
   Passengers paying up to $5,950 for the first post-refit cruise
raised a host of complaints, including flooding in cabins and
bathrooms, sweltering rooms and faulty water taps, showers,
telephones and television sets. Some of these problems were linked
to vibration by the propeller shaft.
   The 19-year-old vessel was used as a troop ship during Britain's
1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
   It was due back in its home port of Southampton Aug. 1 to take
passengers on a trans-Atlantic trip.

   About 8,000 people rallied Friday
to support four Slovenians on trial for allegedly disclosing a
military secret, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   The meeting was organized in a park near Ljubljana, the
Slovenian capital, by an unofficial committee formed to defend
journalists Janez Jansa, David Tasic and Franci Zavrl, along with
Ivan Borstner, a non-commissioned army officer.
   The four were charged by the military court in Ljubljana with
possessing a classified document allegedly dealing with the
deployment of army units in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most developed
republic.
   Protesters said the closed-door trial, which started Monday, was
seen as an attempt to crack down on democratic tendencies in
Slovenia.
   Several speakers, including intellectuals and war veterans,
criticized the military and Yugoslav federal authorities for
wanting to ``usurp the sovereign rights of the Slovenian people,''
Tanjug said.
   Zavrl, the only defendent not in custody, also addressed the
meeting, describing the trial a ``shameful, humiliating court
proceeding,'' the report said.
   All three journalists have in the past sharply criticized the
army and particularly former Defense Minister Branko Mamula,
accusing him of promoting sales of Yugoslav arms to Third World
countries and of misappropriating public funds.
   Earlier Friday, Yugoslavia's presidency rejected an appeal by
the Slovenian leadership that the trial be conducted in the
Slovenian language instead of Serbo-Croatian.
   The republic's leadership has earlier demanded that the trial be
conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers
and that they be released from custody.
   The army rejected the requests, citing what they called the
sensitive nature of the classified documents.

<HEAD>China Says It Is `Consulting' On Cambodia Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

   China said Saturday the idea of a meeting with
the Soviet Union to discuss how to bring peace to Cambodia is still
under discussion.
   China's Foreign Ministry was replying to reports out of
Washington that Deputy Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen and his Soviet
counterpart, Igor Rogachev, would meet in Beijing in August to work
out a peace settlement on Cambodia.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was informed of the planned
meeting during a visit to China a week ago.
   The Cambodian question has been taken up in recent sessions of
Chinese-Soviet political normalization talks held twice a year, but
the August meeting would be the first devoted solely to the
subject. The Foreign Ministry called such a meeting ``still under
consultation.''
   It did not elaborate.
   China has said Cambodia is the main obstacle to normalizing
relations with Moscow. Relations have been strained since the two
Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences
in the early 1960s.
   China, which backs the Khmer Rouge and other forces fighting
Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, says the Soviet Union, financial
supporter for the Hanoi government, must use its influence to end
Vietnam's nine-year occupation of Cambodia.
   The main factions in the Cambodian conflict _ the three-party
resistance coalition, the Vietnam-backed Hun Sen government in
Phnom Penh and Vietnam _ are scheduled to gather in Jakarta next
week to set an agenda for peace negotiations.
   Vietnam, battered by economic crisis and natural disasters at
home, has pledged to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and remove
its total force of about 120,000 by 1990.
   But prospects for peace are clouded by squabbling within the
resistance coalition, the resignation of coalition leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and the future role of the Khmer Rouge, which
ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978. Under Khmer Rouge rule, hundreds
of thousands of Cambodians were killed.
   Soviet and Chinese involvement is considered crucial if peace is
to last in the Southeast Asian nation.
   A settlement to the Cambodian question would also set the stage
for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Soviet Communist Party
chief Mikhail Gorbachev have expressed interest in a summit, but
Deng has stressed that the Kremlin must first remove what China
calls the ``three obstacles,'' particularly the problem of Cambodia.
   The Soviet Union has moved to remove the other two obstacles by
beginning a withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan and easing
tensions along the Chinese border by reducing its troop strength in
Mongolia.

   At a news conference Friday, four scientists on the committee
said the Pentagon is asking for $300 million to conduct research

work could lead to the development of weapons for a war nobody

   The resignation of a top official,
charges of corruption and internal squabbling are hampering efforts
to recover billions of dollars that Ferdinand Marcos allegedly
stole during his 20 years in office.
   There are even calls for scuttling the Presidential Commission
on Good Government, or PCGG, which President Corazon Aquino created
two years ago to recover up to $10 billion in assets that Marcos
and his associates are accused of taking.
   The commission is fighting for control of bank accounts, stock
and real estate scattered throughout the United States, Europe and
Asia, including about $350 million in New York real estate. But so
far, it says it has gained control of only $300 million in various
assets in the Philippines. All but $60 million worth are subject to
lengthy litigation.
   One commission member, Jose Laureta, told reporters that at the
current pace, it might take 100 years to retrieve the money ``if
we're lucky. If we're unlucky, 300 years.''

   The weak dollar is not keeping hordes of
Americans from traveling abroad this summer, but it has prompted
many to seek cheaper destinations, travel consultants and tour
operators report.
   Although some foreign countries are getting more American
tourists than a year ago, overall foreign travel is running at
about the same level as last summer, the travel professionals say.
   That was around 2.3 million Americans, up sharply from the 1.8
million in the summer of 1986, when the dollar's steep slide and
terrorist incidents kept many at home.
   Europe still accounts for about half of all vacation travel
overseas by Americans, and Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Switzerland remain the most popular destinations, with Britain the
leader by far. But the erosion of their buying power abroad has
driven more Americans to countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Turkey, where the dollar goes further, experts say. Costs in those
countries are lower and their currencies have not risen as sharply
against the dollar as others have.

<TEXT>
   In the dusty days of summer, when
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end, New Delhi
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains.
   ``In the West, the rains are depressing. In India they are a
time of great joy, release, beauty and romance,'' says Khushwant
Singh, a noted author and journalist.
   As the rains come, the dust settles. Parched gardens suddenly
turn green. Temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers.
   But the monsoon has its sad side.
   The rains that started early in July ended two years of drought
in northern India, promising good crops at last, but they also
unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370
people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by
contaminated water. The death toll in New Delhi from contaminated
water approached 100. A city official said more than 7,100 others
had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis.
   For New Delhi, the downpour broke the stifling heat, but
telephones went dead, potholes multiplied or grew deeper, and
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and
wells.
   At the first delicious moment of the monsoon, though, the
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant.
   ``The monsoon ... for most Indians ... is not only the source of
life, but also their most exciting contact with nature,'' says
author-journalist Singh.
   When the clouds first burst open over New Delhi, dozens of
half-naked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the Yamuna River.
   ``It's always like this,'' said Gulab, an elderly woman watching
the fun. ``The children love to play in the rain, but they
invariably get sick.''
   More than 5,300 people have been treated this year for
gastro-enteritis and cholera in New Delhi. At least 75 have died,
most of them children.
   Maya Rao, a university teacher who has lived in New Delhi for
many years, described New Delhi's monsoon this way:
   ``There is muck and mud all over, mosquitoes attack you in
hordes, diseases spread like vice. It's impossible to get to places
on time, given the state of the roads, and calling people on the
phone is such a nuisance _ half the phones are dead.''
   Then, she added, there's the humidity.
   ``The moment the rain stops, you sweat to death.''
   Even so, Ms. Rao went on, she can't imagine life without the
monsoon.
   ``What could be more delightful than eating `bhutta' (roasted
corn-on-the-cob) on your terrace as the grey-purple skies melt into
rain?''
   One city official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could do
no work during the monsoon.
   ``It's too beautiful just to relax, sit and watch the rain,'' he
said, as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window.

<HEAD>Upbeat Market Message From `Insiders'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When they hear talk that corporate ``insiders''
are bullish on the stock market these days, many investors take the
message skeptically.
   After all, this supposedly savvy group of chief executives,
directors and major shareholders gave no warning whatsoever last
year that the market was headed for a crash.
   Nevertheless, since that debacle insiders have been buying
stocks of their companies at a furious pace. And the market has
recovered some of the ground it lost last fall.
   ``The rally has now progressed for more than half a year,''
observed Norman Fosback, editor of the investment advisory letter
The Insiders, which defines its subjects as ``America's most
knowledgeable investors.''
   ``Throughout this recovery,'' Fosback adds, ``the insiders have
correctly been flashing bright and clear signals that the market
outlook was bullish.''
   Insiders tend to acquire much of the stock they hold in their
companies through private arrangements such as corporate incentive
plans. Thus, their activity in the open market, which they must
publicly report, is skewed toward sales rather than purchases.
   By Fosback's ``insider indicator,'' the normal level of
insiders' buying is 35 percent of their total open market
transactions. A particularly bullish reading occurs whenever the
percentage gets to 50 or more.
   Immediately after the crash, it surged above 90 percent, and at
the end of 1987 it stood at 79.
   ``Since those on-the-money buy signals, the insider barometers
have gradually eased'' to around 50 percent, Fosback says.
   ``But an objective reading shows that they now stand very close
to the levels that signaled many a major market rally in the 1970s
and early 1980s. The outlook today, in other words, is bullish.''
   Most headlines about insider trading focus on stories of illegal
buying or selling based on information that hasn't yet been made
public. The activity Fosback and other analysts track, however, is
legal, and presumably reflects the special sensitivity insiders
have to their companies' prospects.
   Aaron Feigen, who publishes a newsletter known as The Insider
Outlook, adds that insiders are forced to look beyond short-term
market fluctuations.
   ``Insiders are the only group of investors who are required by
law to be long-term investors,'' he says. ``Government regulations
dictate that insiders must hold their purchases for at least six
months before selling them for a profit.
   ``Because of this regulation, insiders cannot take into
consideration the current mood or direction of the market. Instead,
when they buy they are focused on the `special situations' at their
companies.
   ``They expect to make substantial future capital gains _ more
than they could get elsewhere and with more certainty. And they
have an excellent track record for doing this successfully.''
   If any outsiders want to base their investment strategies on
what insiders are doing, Feigen suggests, they need to be prepared
to be patient, for an indeterminate and sometimes very long time.
   ``Although you can be certain that the insider is investing in
anticipation of a profitable return at some time in the future, you
can't tell what timetable he has in mind for achieving his
profits,'' Feigen says.
   ``There is no pattern that narrowly defines the length of time
that all insiders follow when accumulating their stock.
   ``In many cases, the insider buying is concentrated within a
relatively short time period _ a year or less. But other times it
can go on for years.''

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his name and a birthplace like Salzburg,
Austria, you might expect comedian Bill Kirchenbauer to talk like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   On request, Kirchenbauer does a pretty fair Schwarzenegger, but
his otherwise unaccented speech reflects his peripatetic upbringing
as an Army brat.
   ``I went to 13 schools in 12 years,'' he said. ``In just one
year I went to four schools. I was always the new kid. I was also
the class clown. They can't get mad at you if you're funny.''
   Kirchenbauer is still funny, both as a standup comedian and as
the star of the ABC comedy show ``Just the 10 of Us.'' The show, a
spinoff of ``Growing Pains,'' made its debut in the spring and will
return in the fall. He had originally auditioned for another role
on ``Growing Pains,'' which he didn't get. But they liked him so
much they offered him the role of Coach.
   He plays Coach Lubbock, who loses his job at Dewey High School
on ``Growing Pains'' and is forced to uproot his large family and
take a new job at an all-boys prep school in a small town. He and
his wife, played by Deborah Harmon, have five daughters, two sons,
and one child on the way.
   ``Coach Lubbock was probably named after the city in Texas,''
said Kirchenbauer. ``I lived there, too, when Dad was in the Army.
I was born in Salzburg, then I lived just about everywhere, from
Alaska to Florida. I think that had a lot to do with my becoming a
standup comedian. I moved so much I became the class clown to get
along. I began to look at each class as an audience. I said if you
squint it does look like an audience.
   ``My father was a sergeant-major, although he's now retired. The
first place I can remember was Fort Benning, Ga. We lived on
Ingersol Loop. My mother called me Billiker Boop from Ingersol
Loop. I've never been in the Army myself. I don't take orders very
well, except from a director.''
   He said he had been an entertainer for as long as he could
remember. ``When I was 5 I began working with puppets,'' he said.
``I always put on a show before Christmas. I had a Jerry Mahoney
puppet my parents gave me. Then around 12 they started looking like
dolls so I quit.
   ``In my teens I started doing impressions. I did shows at the
American Legion and places like that. But doing impressions is very
limited. All you can do is take people out of context. And so many
people did impressions better than me. Then I began to do
impressions of things. Like garbage trucks and typewriters and
roller deodorant.''
   He had a job selling video editing equipment, but about 10 years
ago he quit and worked full-time as a comedian.
   Kirchenbauer had previously worked with Alan Thicke when he
produced ``Fernwood 2-Night'' and ``America 2-Night.'' Kirchenbauer
played egotistical singer Tony Roletti.
   He said he sees Coach as a man who's idealistic about the way he
raises his family. ``He just wants the American dream for them,''
he said. ``My wife says he's like me: a bossy know-it-all, but a
sweet kind of guy who would return a wallet if he found it.''
   Kirchenbauer said the thing he likes most about the show is that
he doesn't have to travel as much. ``I enjoy doing the standup, but
the travel gets you down,'' he said. ``Some people get rowdy in the
clubs. I had to knock out a guy in St. Louis. I was using a big
flashlight in my act and I hit him over the head with it. People
think it's a game. You yell at the comedian and he yells back at
you.''
   Kirchenbauer has been appearing on NBC's ``Tonight Show'' for
eight years. The first time he was asked to be on the show he
turned it down. He'd won a competition in San Francisco for standup
comics and he got the call after his picture ran in the Los Angeles
Times. His manager told him he shouldn't go on ``The Tonight Show''
on a gimmick.
   ``I played the coach for six weeks on `Just the 10 of Us' and
now people think that's all I can do,'' he said. ``I've been doing
comedy for more than 10 years.''

   Unfortunately for AT&T's competitors, regulators are beginning
to loosen their grip on the phone giant. Under a new pricing plan
called Tariff 12, for example, AT&T has been able to offer
customized packages of services and equipment to such customers as
General Electric Co., Du Pont Co. and Ford Motor Co.
   ``AT&T's walking around the Fortune 50 handing out Tariff 12
proposals. That forces MCI and Sprint to run around chasing bids
all over the place,'' said Berge Ayvazian, vice president for
research at the Yankee Group.
   The completion of fiber networks in the late 1980s makes
carrying capacity so cheap that one company with staying power _
AT&T _ may be able to keep lowering prices until it drives others
out of business, suggests Mark Cooper, research director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
   More likely, Cooper says, AT&T could set an umbrella price high
enough to make big profits while letting MCI and US Sprint survive.
In that case consumers would be overpaying.
   AT&T strongly disagrees with that theory, saying that there is
vigorous competition in long-distance. MCI and US Sprint also
disagree, but they do say AT&T needs to remain regulated for now.
   ``We have to (make a) transition from a monopoly to competition.
That's a long, slow process. If AT&T wanted to crush competitors,
they could,'' Esrey said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said consumer prices climbed a modest 0.3
percent in June, with declines in gasoline and clothing costs
nearly offsetting a sharp increase in food prices. Other reports
showed housing construction rebounded partially in June from the
sharp slump in May, and American factories, mines and utilities
operated at 83.1 percent of capacity, up 0.2 percentage points from
May.
   _In a quarterly review, the government said growth in personal
income slowed in all but three states during the first three months
of 1988, barely keeping ahead of inflation.
   _Eastern Airlines said it will eliminate 4,000 jobs and cut
service to 14 cities on Aug. 31. It also plans to leave its Western
hub in Kansas City, Mo., as part of a drastic cost-cutting plan.
   _Pratt & Whitney Aircraft said it will cut more than 1,000
white-collar jobs in a move aimed at saving $100 million a year and
enhancing its competitive position in the jet engine market.
   _Roy E. Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney, announced a bid
to take over Polaroid Corp. that values the company at more than
$2.8 billion, challenging management's plan to revitalize the
instant camera company.
   _Macmillan Inc., already the target of a $1.9 billion hostile
tender offer from Robert M. Bass, received a competing bid from
Maxwell Communications Corp. that values the publishing giant at
$2.07 billion.
   _Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it would sell its elevator
business to a Swiss competitor, Schindler Holding AG, for an
undisclosed sum of cash.
   _More than 95 percent of A.H. Robins Co.'s stockholders and
Dalkon Shield claimants have approved a reorganization plan that
could end the company's nearly three-year bankruptcy struggle. The
plan would set up a nearly $2.5 billion trust fund to satisfy
Dalkon Shield claims and smooth the way for a $3.2 billion buyout
by the American Home Products Corp.
   _The chairman of MGM-UA Communications Co., Lee Rich, resigned a
week after controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian announced he
would split the movie and TV company into two.
   _General Motors Corp. said its profit rose strongly in the
second quarter as overseas operations had a record-breaking
performance and sales picked up in North America.
   _Beretta, the Italian arms manufacturer, sued General Motors
Corp. for $250 million, claiming its reputation for fine
workmanship will be ruined if the carmaker continues producing a

   Wall Street traders and brokers have been
treated lately to a smorgasbord of just about everything that can
go wrong in the investment game.
   Bond traders have been pinched by an erratic rise in interest
rates. Fanciers of high-technology stocks have seen their holdings
take a drubbing.
   Sluggish activity has left a big hole in brokers' commission
income. And even the bears who thrive on weak markets got stung by
selling short American depositary shares of Japanese stocks that
they thought were poised for a fall, but went the other way instead.
   Stan Weinstein, publisher of the Professional Tape Reader
investment advisory service, summarized it as ``a neutral trading
range market that has a serious case of the `blahs.'''
   Heading into July, many stock analysts were counting on earnings
reports for the second quarter to give the market a lift.
   True to expectations, results achieved by many companies for the
April-June period have been impressive. Case in point: General
Motors profits, up 54 percent from the comparable period last year.
   But the market chose to concentrate its attention on
disappointing earnings at a succession of high-technology companies
like Seagate Technology, Tandem Computers and Data General.
   And rather than just dumping the shares of the company
announcing the discouraging news, investors have responded each
time by selling stocks throughout the high-tech sector.
   The state of the overall stock market, meanwhile, received
eloquent testimony from the second-quarter reports of brokerage
firms themselves.
   Charles Schwab Corp., operator of the nation's largest discount
brokerage firm and thus considered a good gauge of activity by
individual investors, said its volume of business was off 42
percent from the second quarter last year.
   PaineWebber, a full-service firm that handles a lot of trading
for the public, said its commission revenues fell 32 percent. It
barely cleared a profit for the quarter.
   With all that to set the tone, the stock market took its
sharpest drop in more than three months this past week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 68.46 to 2,060.99,
for its biggest decline since it tumbled 76.26 points the week of
April 11-15.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.10 to
149.55; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 7.24 to 387.35; and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 3.20 at 306.11.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 150.13 million shares a day,
against 175.20 million the week before.
   Normally in declining markets, at least the bears get a chance
to feast by reaping profits on short sales.
   This time-honored strategy calls for borrowing stock from a
broker, selling it, and then buying it back later at a lower price
for return to the broker. The difference, minus commissions, goes
into the short-seller's pocket.
   But it hasn't worked out that way lately for one recent favorite
target of short-sellers, the Japanese stocks traded in this country
in the form of American depositary receipts.
   Many of these familiar names, such as Honda, Matsushita and
Sony, rebounded from the 1987 crash this year to new highs.
   Lately, they have been much discussed on Wall Street as a way to
``play'' a break in the Tokyo market, which by U.S. standards has
returned to very inflated levels.
   However, it looks now as though the shorts were caught in a
squeeze when the stocks failed to decline and they scrambled to buy
stock to cut their losses. For example, Honda, which closed the
previous Friday at 141, soared as high as 179 by Thursday.
   Somewhere on Wall Street, there is presumably someone who safely
traversed this minefield by owning the Japanese stocks and shorting
the technology issues. But otherwise, few have happy tales to tell
right now.

<HEAD>Banks Weathering Drought Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major farm-lending banks are weathering the
drought of the Midwest and South remarkably well.
   The big debt-rating services say the protracted drought
conditions that have dried up the profits of some farmers have left
virtually no wrinkles on the quality of these banks' credit.
   The reason: Savvy bankers left nothing to chance following the
farm crisis of the early 1980s. Most already had reduced their
exposure to agriculture loans by paring down their portfolios and
increasing reserves to cover possible losses, noted recent studies
by Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service.
   The previous farm crisis also weeded out inefficient and highly
indebted operations, while those that remained emerged stronger,
more disciplined, with the help of farm insurance and government
intervention, including price supports and disaster relief, the
reports said.
   ``If anyone is feeling any pain it's likely to be smaller,
unrated institutions,'' which normally don't rely on the credit
markets for additional capital, said Fay Wang, a Moody's analyst
and co-author of its drought-bank report.
   Both S&P and Moody's recently reaffirmed the credit ratings of
bank holding companies with the largest exposures to agriculture
loans, since the possibility of a drought or other problems already
had been factored into their ratings. But they warned that if the
same hot, dry weather conditions persisted next year, credit
quality could suffer.
   A good credit rating translates into cheaper borrowing costs in
the public sector.
   ``Their (banks') access to the credit market helps them on an
ongoing basis to expand in a diversified and less expensive
manner,'' said Nancy Stroker, co-author of S&P's report.
   These days, credit raters are more concerned with broader
problems facing banks, such as their exposure to loans to less
developed countries and for real estate, Ms. Wang said.
   Banks with over 50 percent of their equity tied up in farm loans
are most vulnerable, although only a handful of institutions fall
into that category, according to S&P. First Amarillo Bancorp Inc.,
whose senior debt has been rated non-investment grade, had the
biggest exposure in relationship to its size, with its $167 million
in agriculture loans representing a whopping 871 percent of its
equity, S&P said.
   The banks with the largest overall farm-loan exposure, according
to S&P, were the large Western banks: BankAmerica Corp., which has
about $950 million in agriculture loans; Security Pacific Corp.,
$850 million; Wells Fargo & Co., $630 million; and First Interstate
Bancorp, $596 million. Norwest Corp., with $440 million in loans,
is the largest agriculture lender in the Midwest.
   All of these big banks' loans are manageable because they
represent under a third of their equity base, S&P said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Squeeze Coming To An End</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An ADD containing weekly commodity price trends will follow
later in the cycle.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The orange juice supply squeeze that has raised retail prices
and propelled futures prices to record highs should ease next month
as shipments of frozen concentrate from Brazil resume, experts say.
   But consumers may not see a drop in retail prices of frozen
concentrate until next year, after the new Florida orange crop has
been harvested and processed.
   ``Once we get into the end of the year you get concerns about
Florida freezes, so it might be a while before consumers begin to
see orange juice prices fall,'' said Judith Ganes, orange juice
market analyst for the New York-based investment firm Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``We're not looking for a substantial break to occur until the
end of the winter,'' she said.
   Although U.S. imports of frozen Brazilian juice have declined
steadily as Florida's citrus groves have recovered from a string of
freezes in the early 1980s, imports from Brazil still account for
about 40 percent of U.S. consumption, Ms. Ganes said.
   Brazil says it exported the frozen equivalent of about 77
million gallons of orange juice to the United States from last July
through this past May, about 40 percent less than in the same
period a year ago.
   The declining U.S. dependence on Brazilian imports has been
offset to some degree by rising Brazilian exports to Europe, and
Brazil virtually sold out of orange juice during its latest
July-June marketing year.
   The new Florida orange crop won't be ready for processing until
late fall or early winter. So U.S. orange juice packers, caught
between two harvests, were forced to dig deeper into their frozen
stocks and raise their prices.
   Processing of the rapidly maturing new Brazilian crop will begin
in two weeks or so, and shipments to the United States should
resume before the end of August, analysts said.
   The resumption of imports should bring down prices for future
delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice, which rose to a
record $2.04 a pound July 18 on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Orange juice for September delivery settled Friday at about $1.88 a
pound.
   Wholesale orange juice prices generally lag behind futures
prices by two or three months, Ms. Ganes said. So retailers, who
are now paying about $1.65 a pound for frozen concentrated orange
juice compared with about $1.30 a pound a year ago, may see even
higher prices this fall.
   Consumers may not see significantly lower prices until next
year, but competition among producers and retailers may keep a lid
on prices at the retail level, she said.

<HEAD>Big Business Is Battlefield For Long-Distance Rivals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tumultuous events in the long-distance phone
business this past week show the continuing strains of the nation's
transition away from a monopoly phone network.
   As things stand, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is the
dominant carrier but losing market share, MCI Communications Corp.
has returned to predictable profitability, and US Sprint
Communications Co. is poised at a crossroads between prosperity and
trouble.
   Here is what happened in a rapid-fire week for the long-distance
business:
   _AT&T blamed spiraling expenses for a 0.3 percent decrease in
its second-quarter profits and announced a companywide hiring
freeze, the first since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. It
said it was moving 3,000 managers into sales and marketing.
   _MCI reported a surprising nine-fold quarterly profit increase,
setting records for both profit and revenue, less than a week after
revealing it would buy back the 16.2 percent stake held by
International Business Machines Corp.
   _US Sprint lost another $112 million before taxes in the latest
quarter, its parents said. GTE Corp. said it would reduce its stake
to 19.9 percent early next year, leaving the rest in the hands of
the smaller United Telecommunications Inc.
   ``You put these events together and you really have a snapshot
of the long-distance industry,'' said Eric Arnum, an analyst for
International Resource Development Inc. in Norwalk, Conn.
   AT&T had 72 percent of the long-distance market last year,
followed by MCI with 9.3 percent and US Sprint with 5.6 percent,
according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.
   From here, the battle of the long-distance carriers is expected
to focus on big corporate accounts _ traditionally a stronghold for
AT&T, but an area where the newcomers can build a track record that
carries over to other businesses, analysts said.
   The biggest question at week's end was US Sprint. If the company
fulfills its promises of profitability, GTE will look foolish for
having backed out and United Telecommunications will have the look
of genius.
   William T. Esrey, its new 48-year-old chief, is coming to work
at 6 a.m. and staying into the evening. Analysts call him
intelligent and committed to the goal of turning US Sprint around.
   On the other hand, analysts say some corporate customers are
reluctant to use US Sprint for other than secondary service because
of questions about whether it can blot its red ink. Losses total
$1.76 billion since the company was formed on July 1, 1986.
   Investors seemed willing to give United Telecommunications the
benefit of the doubt. The stock ended the week at $33.25 a share,
scarcely below the $33.62{ that prevailed before it announced plans
to pay GTE about $600 million for 30.1 percent of US Sprint.
   New York-based AT&T has lately lost some of the big jobs that it
once routinely won, a sign that it is losing its aura of
invincibility among major customers.
   Washington-based MCI has nailed down contracts from Merrill
Lynch & Co., the Social Security Administration, United Airlines
and the Defense Department, while US Sprint has gotten work from
the state of Illinois, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and SmithKline
Beckman.
   AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen's drive to hold costs down while
putting more salespeople on the road seems to be at least partly a
response to concerns about long distance _ even though long
distance remains highly profitable for the company, covering losses
in the computer business.
   One analyst compared AT&T to the New York Mets: loaded with
talent, but possibly lacking in desire.
   MCI, in contrast, is looking hot lately after hundreds of
millions of dollars in losses in 1986. Its stock has doubled in the
past year; its founder, William McGowan, is back on the job after a
heart transplant last year; its recent earnings report reflects
inroads into corporate accounts as well as 800 service and
worldwide direct dialing, all AT&T strongholds.
   US Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., has some obvious
advantages, including a high-quality, nationwide fiber network that
will eventually cost roughly $3 billion, said Steven Reynolds, an
analyst with Link Resources in New York.
   Its problems include two years of billing snafus, which it is
only now getting under control. Also, US Sprint lacks some of the
expertise in assembling networks that AT&T has and MCI is quickly
gaining.
   US Sprint is trying to prove its mettle in that area by taking
more advantage of the expertise at Telenet, a unit that is the
nation's biggest network for data transmission.
   Telenet, about the only profitable part of Sprint, has pretty
much gone its own way for the past two years, a situation that US
Sprint's new chief vows to change.
   ``I don't think we've done as good a job as we ought to there,''
said Esrey, who is chief executive of United Telecommunications,
and took on the added role of US Sprint chief executive when Robert
Snedaker abruptly retired this past week.
   Esrey predicted US Sprint would be profitable ``in the
not-too-distant future.'' But after steadily pushing back its
timetable for profitability, he has stopped naming dates.

   Here are some commodity price trends for the past week.
   Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in September settled Friday at $3.84{ a
bushel compared with $3.93{ a week earlier; September corn fell to
$3.12{ a bushel from $3.43; September oats skidded to $2.60 a
bushel from $3.17{; and August soybeans plunged to $8.30{ a bushel
from $9.91{.
   Livestock and meat futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   August live cattle advanced to 66.12 cents a pound from 64.27
cents; August feeder cattle rose to 77.37 cents a pound from 74.75
cents; August hogs finished at 46.12 cents a pound compared with
44.37 cents; and July frozen pork bellies expired Friday at 39.75
cents a pound compared with 37.30 cents a week earlier.
   Precious metals moved higher on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   August gold advanced to $442.90 a troy ounce from $441.30; July
silver moved to $7.606 a troy ounce from $7.310.
   Energy futures leaped higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery settled
at $16.38 a barrel, up from $14.97; August heating oil surged to
44.95 cents a gallon from 41.12 cents; unleaded gasoline improved
to 52.07 cents a gallon from 49.73 cents.

   Energy futures prices were little changed after
falling in early trading and then recovering on technical factors.
   The September contract for the benchmark U.S. crude oil, West
Texas Intermediate, fell 1 cent to $16.38 a 42-gallon barrel Friday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Thursday, the contract rose
34 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the contract for
August delivery of unleaded gasoline slipped 0.03 cent to 52.07
cents a gallon, while August home heating oil fell 0.58 cent to
44.95 cents a gallon.
   ``It was a mixed-bag session,'' said John Azarow, a trader with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Early trading was dominated by events in the Persian Gulf,
Azarow said.
   Traders became pessimistic about the impact the proposed
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq could have on already abundant
world oil supplies, Azarow said. Both countries could step up oil
production, adding to the glut, as they try to repair their
economies following the war, he said.
   Traders were thinking, ``Maybe the outbreak of peace is not that
good for prices after all,'' Azarow said.
   Contracts then fell to their lows _ with the September West
Texas Intermediate contract sinking to $16.12 _ after reports of an
Iraqi attack on Iran, Azarow said.
   But when prices did not fall further, the session turned around
on technical factors, Azarow said.
   ``New buyers felt confident because the market showed some
support,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up 0.3 Percent in June; Wall Street Finishes Down
Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market failed to shake its recent slump despite an
encouraging government report that consumer prices rose a modest
0.3 percent in June.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 25.60 points Friday
to 2,060.99, stretching its loss for the week to 68.46 points. That
marked the biggest weekly decline for the closely watched average
since it dropped 76.26 points April 11-15.
   Despite the favorable consumer price report and a modest decline
in interest rates, investors still showed little enthusiasm for
stocks, analysts said.
   In another dose of good economic news, the Treasury Department
said a surge in quarterly income tax payments by companies and
individuals gave the federal government a rare $9.5 billion surplus
in June. That left the cumulative red ink for the first nine months
of the fiscal year below last year's levels.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, meanwhile, uncertainty about the
weather outlook for the weekend and beyond in the drought-parched
Farm Belt pushed most crop futures prices lower.
   Soybean prices for near-term delivery fell for the fifth
straight day, bringing the August contract to just over $8.30 a
bushel, the lowest price for near-month delivery since June 2.
   The Labor Department's report said the 0.3 percent June rise in
consumer prices worked out to a moderate annual rate of 4.2
percent, with the effects of the drought showing up clearly only in
poultry and egg prices.
   Food price rises held to a 0.6 percent gain despite the biggest
surge in poultry and egg prices since August 1986, when the nation
was in the midst of another drought.
   Offsetting increases on grocery shelves were a 0.2 percent
decline in energy prices and a 0.3 percent drop in clothing costs.
   ``I'd say the report is good news. It clearly shows that
inflation is not getting out of hand. It has accelerated over the
last year or so, but very gradually and very unevenly,'' said
Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm.
