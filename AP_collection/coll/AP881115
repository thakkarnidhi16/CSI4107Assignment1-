<HEAD>Former Sect Pastor Gets 2-Year Prison Term In Boy's Death</HEAD>

   A judge on Monday sentenced the former
pastor of a faith-healing sect to two years in prison for his part
in the death of the son of church members, saying he wanted to send
a message to cultists.
   Jeffrey A. Siegel, 33, of Chapel Hill, N.C., was convicted of
second-degree criminal mistreatment. Spokane County Superior Court
Judge John Schultheis said circumstances warranted going beyond the
standard 90-day sentence for the crime, the maximum the prosecutor
sought.
   ``I have an obligation to send a message ... to anyone who might
be interested in beginning a religious cult,'' Schultheis told
Siegel.
   Siegel was the former pastor of a nameless Christian sect that
eschewed conventional medicine in favor of prayer. Aaron Norman, the
10-year-old son of sect members Bobby and Judith Norman, died Dec.
20, 1987, of untreated juvenile diabetes.
   Bobby Norman, 43, was convicted last month of first-degree
manslaughter for failing to seek medical attention for his son.
Charges against Mrs. Norman were dismissed prior to the trial.
   ``Why is it that it takes a tragedy for people to realize what
they've been doing is wrong?'' asked Schultheis. ``Medicine has been
given to us by God as much as the power of prayer.''
   Siegel also was sentenced to serve six months for a charge of
simple assault stemming from a spanking administered to an adult
church member in a separate incident. That sentence will be served
concurrently, meaning Siegel will be eligible for parole in 16
months, Schultheis said.
   Before he was sentenced, a tearful Siegel told Schultheis he was
``absolutely ashamed'' of his participation in the sect and its
``rigid view of the outside world.''
   ``I am absolutely heartbroken for what happened to Aaron
Norman,'' Siegel said.
   Testimony during the three-week trial indicated the gravely ill
boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and sect
founder Doug Kleber while Siegel and other church elders watched.
The beatings were believed necessary to get the boy to confess the
sin of masturbation and be healed.
   As pastor, Siegel knew, or should have known, that Aaron Norman
was vulnerable, Schultheis said. Spankings and other discipline of
the 10-year-old ``manifested deliberate cruelty,'' the judge said.
   Kleber, 34, of Champaign-Urbana, Ill., has pleaded guilty to
second-degree criminal mistreatment and is scheduled to be sentenced
later.
   Testimony also revealed that members were expected to consult
with church leaders on matters ranging from buying a car to their
sex lives. The fellowship once claimed 300 adult members in four
states, but disbanded in February.

   Harvard Law School students are helping
the homeless by making less expensive travel arrangements on job
interview trips and asking prospective employers to donate the
savings to shelters nationwide.
   ``We've got 125 (firms) going in on it, so I guess it's
popular,'' school spokesman Michael Chmura said of the program
called Firm Commitment. ``We're talking to the business school, the
Stanford Law School, and other schools to set up a similar thing for
next year.''
   In the job interview season that started in October, students are
booking trips through a Boston discount service, Filene's Travel
Service, Chmura said. They are also staying at less expensive hotels
than normal. The law firms interviewing the students are asked to
donate the savings to a local homeless shelter.
   In addition to raising money through the firms, Filene's is
donating part of its travel agent commission to local shelters,
Chmura said.

   A five-headed Khmer bust of Siva, the Hindu god of
destruction and reproduction, has sold for $574,200, an auction
record for any Southeast Asian work of art at auction, Sotheby's
said.
   The 31{-inch high, gray sandstone bust was sold Monday by an
anonynmous collector and bought by an unidentified overseas bidder.
   The figure dated from the third quarter of the 10th century. No
history of it was otherwise recorded, except that the uppermost head
had been in the Pan Asian Collection, most of which is in the Los
Angeles County Museum.
   Each of the heads wears an enigmatic smile. The uppermost head
was acquired by the seller, who reunited it with the rest of the
figure.
   The sale at Monday's auction of some 100 lots of Khmer, Thai,
Indian and Himalayan art totaled $2.8 million. The three top-priced
lots were sold by the same collector.
   A 7th century head of Buddha from Thailand, larger than lifesize,
was bought for $376,200 by a Swiss collector. Another anonymous
buyer paid a similar price for a 4-foot standing figure of a Khmer
four-armed male deity from the first half of the 9th century.
   The bidders included American and Swiss collectors and London
dealers.

   Pop superstar Michael Jackson canceled a
sold-out performance shortly before he was supposed to take the
stage Monday night because of swollen vocal chords, his publicist
said.
   The decision, announced about 40 minutes before the start of the
show, was made on advice of the singer's physician, publicist Lee
Solters said.
   Tuesday's sold-out performance also was canceled, and both will
be rescheduled at a later date, Solters said.
   An estimated 30,000 ticketholders at the Sports Arena were told
to save their stubs for admission to the new shows, Solters said.
   Jackson began a six-concert engagement Sunday night as part of
his worldwide tour promoting his ``Bad'' album.
   Concerts on Nov. 20, 21, and 22 will go on as scheduled, Solters
said.

<HEAD>Pakistan Now Armed With Nuclear Weapons, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan appears to have finally developed
atomic weapons, increasing the threat of a nuclear war with India
and representing a major setback to efforts to stem the spread of
atomic weapons around the globe, says a study published today.
   ``After a decade of slow advances, Pakistan appears to have''
joined a group of three other nations that have nuclear weapons but
don't admit it, according to the review by the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.
   The other countries in that category are Israel, India and South
Africa, said the report, the fourth such survey published by the
non-profit group that specializes in national security studies.
   Five nations have said they possess nuclear weapons: the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Great Britain and France. A sixth,
India, exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a
non-military explosion.
   Efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have
focused on the Middle East and South Asia, the report noted.
Pakistan and India have been the chief source of concern, since the
two countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were
created by the separation of colonial India from Britain.
   The report, titled ``The Undeclared Bombs,'' was written by
Leonard S. Spector, author of the three previous reports. Spector
formerly worked on non-proliferation issues at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
non-proliferation subcommittee.
   In the past two years, Spector said, ``convincing evidence
emerged that Pakistan had crossed the nuclear weapons threshold and
had acquired the essentials for its first nuclear weapons.''
   That evidence includes production of highly enriched uranium, a
key component of atomic weapons; and European reports of a
previously clandestine effort by Pakistan officials to smuggle
sophisticated nuclear components out of West Germany.
   The Pakistani program is a dilemma for the United States, Spector
said in an interview, because Pakistan is a prime recipient of U.S.
aid at the same time U.S. officials are pushing Pakistan not to
develop atomic weapons.
   Two years ago, President Reagan certified to Congress that
Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons, a certification required
by Capitol Hill before the U.S. aid program could go ahead. But in
recent months, U.S. officials have been less direct in asserting
that the Pakistanis don't have atomic weapons.
   Meanwhile, India has responded by quietly expanding its atomic
weapons capability and has also worked on development of delivery
systems, including medium-range rockets, the report said. India has
the ingredients to build between 20 and 50 atomic weapons, it said.
   For the future, Spector said, ``most observers are looking for
some sort of mechanism, some kind of regional arrangement, to bring
India and Pakistan into negotiations. The concept is to find a way
to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves. It will be
difficult, but it may be achievable.''
   The report also highlighted increasing dangers in the volatile
Mideast, particularly in light of the spread of long-range missiles
and chemical weapons among Arab enemies of Israel.
   Israel has refused to admit to possessing nuclear weapons, but
the report said the Israelis have ``a substantial, undeclared
nuclear arsenal of at least 50 to 60 nuclear devices _ and perhaps
significantly more _ some of which are an advanced design.''
   The risk of nuclear escalation in a future Mideast war has
``seriously increased,'' the study said, because of the improved
capabilities of Arab nations to inflict damage through missiles and
chemical weapons.
   ``Indeed, in 1988, Israeli leaders began implicitly referring to
this possibility by declaring that Israel would have the ability to
retaliate against an anti-city missile or chemical attack `many
times over,''' it said.
   In Latin America, the report said, a nuclear monitoring agreement
between Argentina and Brazil should be the ``top non-proliferation
priority for the coming year.''
   That is because Brazil announced last year that it had mastered
the process of enriching uranium and had begun a pilot program at a
plant that was not subject to international safeguards. Argentina
had a similar capability at least five years ago, the report noted.
   While both nations have pledged not to produce weapons-grade
uranium, those pledges need to be enshrined in formal policy, the
study said.

   A premature baby stolen from a hospital
two weeks ago by a woman posing as a nurse was found in good
condition Monday, and the mother recommended the kidnapper ``just
ask the Lord to forgive her for what she's done.''
   Christopher Michael Jones, who was born weighing only 4 pounds,
was found at a home in Hot Springs, 50 miles away, by FBI agents and
police responding to a tip to a hot line, said Little Rock Detective
Ronnie Smith. The caller said the baby might be at the home, he said.
   Acqunetta Rushon Smith, 32, who has worked as a nurse's aide in
Hot Springs and has four childre, was charged with kidnapping, said
Hot Springs police Lt. Bobby Thomas. She was in jail Monday night
and bond had not been set.
   A neighbor of Ms. Smith said she had not seen the baby during the
past two weeks. ``All I heard was that she had had a baby,'' Stella
Kidd said. ``I never seen him. When I would see her coming in and
out of her house, it looked like she could have been an expectant
mama, you know, with the clothes she wore.''
   ``If she took the baby because of a loss in her own life, I hope
that she will have the opportunity to get some help,'' the child's
mother, Annette Thomas-Jones, said at a news conference Monday
night. ``I forgive her.''
   She held the baby, dressed in a tiny white shirt reading
``Welcome Home,'' and said, ``He looks like $250 million wrapped up
_ not just a million, but 250 million. He looks fantastic. He looks
like his daddy.''
   When she first was reunited with Christopher, she said, ``I held
him and I looked at him and I checked his fingers out and his toes
out and his legs and his stomach and his head and everything's there.
   ``I feel wonderful, I feel relieved, joyful, thankful. I'm
happy,'' she said. ``I knew the Lord was going to bring Christopher
home for us.''
   Applause broke out from a crowd of about two dozen neighbors and
members the news media when Mrs. Thomas-Jones, 32, and her husband,
Willie Jones, 39, emerged from their house on their way to Doctors
Hospital to be reunited with the infant.
   ``Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, hallelujah!'' Mrs.
Thomas-Jones shouted.
   ``I just want to thank the media,'' she said, tears welling up in
her eyes and her voice breaking with emotion. ``Praise the Lord.''
   Local broadcasts and newspapers had carried repeated appeals by
Mrs. Thomas-Jones, her minister and others for information leading
to the baby's return.
   The reports all noted that Christopher needed continued medical
attention because he was six weeks premature when he was born Oct.
29. Mrs. Thomas-Jones, who has two daughters, handed him over Nov. 1
to a woman posing as a nurse at the hospital who said she needed to
weigh the baby.
   A banner at Doctors Hospital read ``Welcome Home, Christopher''
in baby blue letters, and small baby blue ribbons were being handed
out to employees and visitors by hospital spokeswoman Jessica
Szenher.
   Authorities first took Christopher to AMI National Park Medical
Center in Hot Springs for an examination, said hospital executive
director Warner Kass.
   ``The baby is in good condition, needs only what a normal infant
should need, as far as we know,'' Kass said.
   Christopher gained 1} pounds since being kidnapped, FBI agent Don
Pettus said.
   Dr. Susan Keathley, a pediatrician from Doctors Hospital who
examined the baby, said: ``I was surprised. Somebody has spent a lot
of time feeding him to put on a pound in two weeks.''
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones said: ``I agree. She took very good care of the
baby.''
   A positive identification was made through a footprint, said Ron
Wolfe of the FBI's Little Rock office.

<HEAD>Millions Of Transport Workers To Be Subject To Drug Tests</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto WX8</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of transportation workers including
pilots and truckers will be subject to random drug tests under a new
federal directive that is likely to be challenged in court before it
goes into effect in December 1989.
   The Transportation Department announced the broad-ranging drug
testing requirements Monday, and immediately the head of the airline
pilots' union promised to fight the regulation both in Congress and
in the courts.
   The testing requirements cover all types of transportation,
including airlines, long-distance trucks and urban transit systems.
   ``The American people demand and expect a drug-free
transportation system. These new rules will take us as far as
practically possible toward that goal,'' Transportation Secretary
Jim Burnley said at a news conference.
   He acknowledged the tests likely will be challenged in the
courts. The Supreme Court already has before it two separate
drug-testing cases _ including one involving post-accident testing
of railroad workers _ that are expected to be decided next year.
   The series of federal regulations announced by Burnley call for
transportation companies _ airlines, trucking companies, railroads
and commercial shipping companies _ to have comprehensive testing
programs in place by December 1989. Companies with 50 or fewer
employees, including tens of thousands of over-the-road independent
truckers, have another year to comply.
   The Transportation Department estimated the testing will cost
businesses more than $2.1 billion during the first 10 years, but
Burnley said the testing will save the same companies about $8.7
billion in increased productivity, accident reductions and medical
cost savings.
   In addition to random tests, the regulations call for drug
testing before employment if there is reasonable cause to suspect
drug use, periodically such as during annual physicals, and after an
accident. The drugs covered by the tests are marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, amphetamines and PCP.
   The random-testing provision, which requires that at least 50
percent of a given work force be tested during a single year, has
attracted the strongest protests, especially from unions. They argue
that such tests constitute an invasion of privacy, have minimal
benefit and will subject thousands of workers to the consequences of
``false positive'' results.
   ``Random testing is a counterproductive, shotgun strategy that is
at the same time an unwarranted invasion of privacy and of no
significant value in the battle against drug abuse,'' said Henry
Duffy, president of the 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association.
   The required testing programs cover:
   _Nearly 3 million long-distance truckers, including independent
drivers and those who work directly for large trucking companies.
Intercity bus drivers also must be tested.
   _More than 538,000 aviation employees, including 50,000
commercial pilots, 80,000 flight attendants and 300,000 airline
mechanics. Air traffic controllers already are subject to similar
testing requirements.
   _About 90,000 railroad industry workers, including engineers,
brakemen and train dispatchers.
   _Nearly 200,000 urban transit workers, including subway and
transit bus drivers and mechanics.
   _About 200,000 merchant seamen and other mariners on commercial
vessels that carry passengers or cargo. Fishermen are not covered by
the rules.
   Critics question whether the regulations can be enforced, at
least as they pertain to independent long-distance truck drivers.
   DOT officials said such independents will have to join in
``testing pools'' or be tested under a program operated by the
company for which they do business. Officials acknowledged the rules
do not require truckers to carry proof that they are participating
in a testing program.
   ``The big question is how are you going to enforce it'' in the
case of the self-employed independents, said David Gordon, a
spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, which represents
the trucking companies.
   Duffy of the airline pilots union said he fears random testing
``may be used by management as a punitive measure against pilots.''
He criticized the DOT regulation for leaving the program to be
administered by management with no requirement for rehabilitation.
   Burnley said the aim is ``getting the people (with drug problems)
off the jobs.'' He said the issue of rehabilitation will have to be
worked out through labor-management negotiations.
   DOT officials said in the last two years there have been 60
railroad accidents in which participants were found to have been
using drugs, although drug use was not always directly implicated in
the accidents.
   The worst of these was a Jan. 4, 1987 collision of a Conrail
locomotive and an Amtrak passenger train in Chase, Md., in which 16
people were killed and 178 were injured. The Conrail engineer and
brakeman admitted having smoked marijuana shortly before the
accident.

<HEAD>U.S. Bishops Weigh Rejection of Draft Vatican Document</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto WX10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops is
moving toward a showdown vote on whether to reject a draft Vatican
document questioning the theological authority of such conferences.
   The bishops softened the wording of their proposed reply to the
Vatican document on Monday but pressed toward a scheduled Wednesday
vote without changing their underlying judgment: ``The draft is not
suitable.''
   Despite frequent public compliments from both sides, relations
have often been uneasy between the Vatican and bishops' conferences,
particularly those such as the Americans' which have seemed to be
growing in prestige in recent years.
   Pope John Paul II has publicly supported many of the U.S.
conference's efforts, including national pastoral letters that
stirred controversy outside the church for their criticism of Reagan
administration policies on nuclear arms and the U.S. economy.
   However, there also has been criticism from high Vatican
officials, who have asked for whom the bishops were speaking in
commenting on matters of doctrine, and on what authority.
   Also on Monday, acceding to a Vatican request, the bishops
postponed a vote on another controversial item _ but did so only
grudgingly and with rare public complaints about the way church
leaders in Rome had handled the situation.
   While the bishops gave ground, they took pains to say they were
not knuckling under to Vatican pressure.
   ``We have not bowed obsequiously to Rome in an untoward
fashion,'' said Archbishop Oscar Lipscomb of Mobile, Ala., objecting
to a reporter's suggestion that that was what had happened.
   About 300 U.S. Roman Catholic cardinals, archbishops and bishops
had been scheduled to vote today on new guidelines for settling
disputes between theologians and bishops. But a letter from the
Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith complained that
the guidelines would make the theologians and bishops equals in the
settlement process.
   Bishop Raymond Lessard of Savannah, Ga., chairman of the bishops'
Committee on Doctrine, said he felt all that was ``sufficiently
addressed'' in the guidelines document. However, he added that it
seemed wise to postpone action until the bishops' June meeting.
   Several bishops complained about the timing of the Vatican's
complaint, including Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, who said
the intervention ``might be perceived as confrontational or as
belittling the episcopal conference, which I know is not intended.''
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said the Vatican agency was
understaffed, a possible explanation for the last-minute nature of
the objection. However, Archbishop John May of St. Louis, president
of the U.S. bishops conference, said the Vatican had had the
proposal for more than a year.
   As for the draft Vatican document on bishops' conferences, a
number of U.S. bishops apparently had been stung by news stories
quoting in advance from the proposed rejection notice.
   The new version, distributed by a committee of past conference
presidents on Monday, is considerably toned down from the original,
which had used such phrases as ``rigid and confusing'' and ``overly
defensive and negative'' to describe the Vatican draft.
   However, it still calls for the bishops to label the Vatican
effort ``non-placet,'' so flawed that it isn't even suitable to be
used as a basis for revision.
   Several bishops objected to such a label, suggesting it would be
a slap at the Vatican. This raised the possibility that the
conference's objections would have to be softened further if they
are to win the two-thirds majority necessary in Wednesday's vote.
   In other action Monday, the bishops:
   _Gave first reading to one proposal that would call for easing of
a 1986 law and give legal standing to many more undocumented
Hispanic workers, and to another resolution calling for acceleration
of religious freedom and an end to intimidation of worshipers in the
Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc countries.
   _Postponed action on a resolution calling for movement toward
normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam.
Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said Vietnamese-American

<HEAD>Study Shows Poor Physical Fitness Triples Heart Risk in Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women in poor physical shape are three times
more likely to die at an early age of heart disease than are those
who keep themselves in good condition, according to a long-term
study.
   Dr. Lars G. Ekelund, the principal author of the study, said it
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from
heart disease, just as it does men.
   Poor physical fitness ``is almost as important as smoking as a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease'' in women, said Ekelund, a
researcher at the University of North Carolina.
   The study was based on a 10{-year follow-up of 2,802 women who
ranged in age from 30 to 69. The results were presented Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Heart Association.
   ``This had been seen in males. Now it carries over into
females,'' said Dr. Paul L. McHenry of the Krannert Institute in
Indianapolis. ``This confirms what we all expected.''
   During the study, women walked on treadmills while their heart
rates were measured. Those who are physically fit have lower heart
rates while exercising than do people who are in poor shape.
   The researchers divided the women into four groups, depending on
their heart rates. During mild exercise, those in the most fit group
averaged 107 beats per minute, compared with 152 beats among the
least fit women.
   During the decade of followup, 40 women died of heart attacks,
strokes and heart failure. The risk of cardiovascular death was less
than 1 percent among the fit women and 2 percent in those who were
unfit.
   Ekelund said that while much of the difference in physical
fitness may be inherited, people can also improve their level of
fitness by exercise.
   ``It has been shown by many studies that you can improve fitness
levels by just walking,'' he said. ``Many people could benefit from
this. Later, if they felt like they needed more, they could progress
to jogging. But the important thing is to have a regular exercise
program.''
   The new findings in women are similar to those reported by the
same researchers in a study of men.
   Ekelund said the risk of being out of shape is close to that of
smoking or high blood pressure.
   Being unfit may be more of a problem for women than for men, he
said, because less than 20 percent of U.S. women say they get
regular physical activity, compared with about a third of all men.
   Among other studies presented at the meeting:
   _Consumption of fat by Americans has fallen substantially since
the mid-1960s. Dr. Alison M. Stephen of the University of
Saskatchewan said people may simply be trimming meat better and
throwing away more fat. She said the dietary change may be a major
cause of the drop in heart attack deaths that began in the late
1960s.
   _Doctors report progress in developing a variety of devices that
clean out clogged heart arteries by shaving, sanding and burning
away fatty deposits. All of them are intended to improve or replace
balloon angioplasty, a widely used procedure in which doctors reopen
clogged arteries by temporarily inflating tiny balloons inside them.
   _The heart disease death rate is declining dramatically among
middle-aged white men. A study by Dr. Lewis Kuller from the
University of Pittsburgh showed that in one county in Pennsylvania,
the death rate in this group fell 53 percent between 1970 and 1984.
A decline in cardiac arrest accounted for the largest share of the
drop.

   Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August
was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with
the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant
conducting debut there with the orchestra.
   And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three
Bernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well. As well
it should: It was the 1,215th time Bernstein conducted the orchestra.
   On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistant
conductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short notice
there was no rehearsal. The concert was broadcast nationally on
radio. And there was such acclaim that Bernstein, who had never led
the orchestra in concert until that day, was catapulted to fame, at
age 25.
   At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was the
Philharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as his
assistant, was introduced from a box.
   Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that
Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night. Eight
others who also were members in 1943 _ violinist Louis Fishzohn,
oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch,
cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker,
and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano _ went on stage.
   Bernstein gave bear hugs to all nine.
   ``I feel older than all of them,'' said Bernstein.
   Bernstein was given a silver box engraved with a reproduction of
Monday evening's program cover _ a caricature of him, with jutting
chin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading ``with love
and thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.''
   ``Will this birthday never end?,'' he told the audience.
   Monday's concert began with Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms,''
with the splendid Westminster Symphonic Choir. Todd Caruso, a member
of the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sang
the solo part.
   Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga in
the Soviet Union, was soloist in ``Serenade for Violin, String
Orchestra, Harp and Percussion.'' Kremer's sound isn't warm but his
technique is breathtaking.
   Pianist Krystian Zimerman, who was born in Zabrze, Poland, often
performs with Bernstein in Europe. He was the respectful and
thoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program,
Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra,'' subtitled
``The Age of Anxiety'' after W.H. Auden's poem.
   All the performers donated their services, with proceeds
benefiting the Philharmonic's efforts on behalf of American
conductors.

<HEAD>Psychotherapy May Help Prevent Cancer and Heart Disease, Studies
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Risks for cancer or heart disease may be revealed
through analyzing personality, and psychotherapy may be able to head
off the diseases, according to controversial research.
   ``If the research ... holds up under ongoing scientific scrutiny,
we will be entering a new era of health care and disease
prevention,'' British psychologist Hans Eysenck writes in the
December issue of Psychology Today.
   The thrust of research by Eysenck and psychologist Ronald
Grossarth-Maticek is that repressed emotions and hopelessness may
lead to cancer, and hostility and aggression to heart disease.
   Grossarth-Maticek has developed a six-question personality quiz
to identify people prone to cancer or heart disease, Eysenck writes.
   But in a statement accompanying Eysenck's article, senior editor
Joshua Fischman warns that researchers have spotted inconsistencies
and technical problems in Grossarth-Maticek's studies.
   One psychologist found the studies ``unable to achieve the level
of certainty that science demands,'' Fischman writes.
   ``The findings right now represent more hope than certainty, but
it is because of that hope, and the hope for further debate and
research, that we are presenting them,'' Fischman writes.
   According to Eysenck, Grossarth-Maticek's studies supported the
theory by predicting disease 10 years or more before people died of
it.
   In that research, almost half the people considered cancer-prone
died from that disease and fewer than a tenth from heart disease. Of
those considered at risk for heart disease, about a third died of it
but only one-fifth died of cancer, Eysenck wrote.
   Other studies found the risk could be reduced through
psychotherapy aimed at the personality flaws, Eysenck wrote. For
example, 45 of 50 people considered cancer-prone who went through
psychotherapy were still alive 13 years later, compared to 19 of
another 50 at risk who did not receive psychotherapy, he said.
   Some studies also suggest similar psychotherapy can help people
with cancer live longer, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Woman President `Inevitable'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan told a group of schoolchildren
that he believes it's ``inevitable'' that a woman will one day be
president, most likely after first serving as vice president.
   The president's comments came during a question-and-answer
session with junior and senior high school students from four
Washington-area schools.
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   Reagan said the idea of a woman president would take ``a little
getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.

<HEAD>Trade Problems To Face Incoming Agriculture Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nagging trade problems and preliminary
maneuvering on a new U.S. farm bill will face the Bush
administration's incoming secretary of agriculture next year.
   Lobbying for the Cabinet post already is in full swing, although
President-elect George Bush and his advisors have been focusing on
other matters and have dropped no hints about who might get the job.
   Trade issues will be near the top of the agenda for the new
agriculture secretary.
   Little progress has been made in reaching agreement on farm
provisions of a new 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) agreement, despite two years of talks in Geneva. A U.S. call
for phasing out farm subsidies by the year 2000 has received a
chilly reception.
   Also stalled are talks aimed at reaching a new long-term grain
agreement with the Soviet Union.
   The most recent, five-year agreement expired Sept. 30 and there
have been no formal talks since Oct. 24, when the United States
rejected a Soviet proposal calling for a one-year agreement.
   A free-trade agreement that would phase out most tariffs between
the United States and Canada had been approved by Congress but is
running into trouble in Ottawa. That is not viewed as altogether bad
among some U.S. wheat producers and potato growers who never had
much use for the pact anyway.
   Failure of the agreement, however, would be guaranteed to make
life more complex for the next agriculture secretary.
   On Capitol Hill, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees plan
to start talking next year about a farm bill to replace the omnibus
1985 farm legislation that expires in two years.
   The 1985 law is largely a blueprint for a massive cleanout of
huge grain surpluses that had piled up, driving down prices and
bringing on what came to be known as the crisis in rural America.
   Huge subsidies were provided to boost exports at clearance sale
prices as part of the effort to make farm surpluses disappear.
Surplus milk and cheese remaining on the shelf were simply given
away to the poor.
   The measure is generally viewed as a success. USDA analysts say
net cash income for the farm sector in 1988 should be near, and may
top by a small margin last year's record $57.1 billion, despite the
summer drought.
   For that reason many in the agricultural community think there
will be little change in the thrust of the next bill.
   But the secretary is certain to face an array of tough challenges
as lawmakers set about their work. New programs to help specific
crops are bound to be debated along with plans to reform the
troubled federal crop insurance program and further tighten
pesticide regulation.
   With the 70-year-old Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng saying
the time for retirement has arrived, or at least will when Bush is
sworn in, candidates are lining up for the secretary's job.
   One who says he does not want to serve in the Cabinet and would
like to return to private industry is U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton K. Yeutter. The one-time Nebraska feedlot operator had long
been mentioned as a possible future agriculture secretary.
   Getting a strong boost from congressional Republicans is Rep. Tom
Coleman, R-Mo. He is a force on the House Agriculture Committee but
is not a farmer and, thus, like Lyng, might need to have someone
with experience in production agriculture in the deputy secretary's
slot.
   Lyng's deputy, Peter C. Myers, raised crops and livestock in
southeastern Missouri between 1955 and 1982, when he came to
Washington to become head of the Soil and Conservation Service. He
has become a favorite at USDA.
   Bush's campaign assurances to voters that he is an
environmentalist might sway him to opt for Myers, the architect of
several major soil conservation measures contained in the 1985 farm
law.
   That far from exhausts the list. If Lyng's low-key, businesslike
approach captures Bush's fancy, the new president could turn to Bill
Lesher, a Washington consultant and former Lyng business partner.
Also being mentioned are former Rep. Cooper Evans, R-Iowa;
Mississippi soybean farmer Seymour Johnson and American Farm Bureau
past President Bob Delano.

<HEAD>Supreme Court: No Abortion Veto Rights for Fathers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, at least for now, is keeping
out of the continuing national debate over abortion rights.
   The justices on Monday refused to give husbands legal power to
prevent their wives from terminating pregnancies.
   Without comment, they rejected arguments by an Indiana man who
said he had ``fundamental rights and interests in his unborn
child.'' The action left intact a state court ruling that upheld a
mother's right to have an abortion.
   There has been speculation that an increasingly conservative high
court is prepared to take a new look at its landmark 1973 ruling,
Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion nationwide.
   The author of the 12-year-old court opinion, Justice Harry A.
Blackmun, has said he believes there is ``a very distinct
possibility'' Roe vs. Wade will be reversed during the court's
current term.
   But on Monday, the justices gave no signs they are eager to
tackle an abortion controversy now.
   The court let stand a ruling last July by the Indiana Supreme
Court that said allowing a husband to block a wife's abortion is
barred by past high court rulings.
   The high court in 1976 struck down a Missouri law requiring
spousal consent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the
first 12 weeks of her pregnancy.
   The Indiana case stems from an attempt last summer by Erin Andrew
Conn of Elkhart, Ind., to prevent his estranged wife, Jennifer, from
having an abortion. She was about six weeks pregnant at the time.
   A state trial judge issued a temporary order barring Mrs. Conn
from having the operation, but a state appeals court threw out that
order.
   ``Erin has no right to veto Jennifer's decision ... as such
decision concerns only her,'' the appeals court ruled.
   The Indiana Supreme Court upheld the appeals court ruling.
   The injunction prohibiting Mrs. Conn's abortion was lifted last
July 22 and she had an abortion.
   The Conns are in the midst of divorce proceedings. Conn's
attorney, James Bopp of Terre Haute, said a decree is expected
within days.
   The father argued that the 1973 and 1976 high court rulings did
not preclude state courts from taking a husband's rights into
consideration ``on a case-by-case basis.''
   ``The father has fundamental rights and interests in his unborn
child which should be judicially considered, on the facts of this
case, along with the rights and interests of his wife in aborting
their child,'' lawyers for Erin Conn said.
   But the Indiana courts rejected such a balancing test.
   In other action, the Supreme Court:
   _Cleared the way for enforcement of federal court subpoenas
requiring Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos to turn over financial records
and other material to a grand jury.
   The justices refused to shield the deposed president and first
lady of the Philippines from the subpoenas, related to a New York
case in which they are charged with looting their nation's treasury
of more than $100 million.
   _Ruled, 6-3, in a case from Arkansas that states may hold a
second sentencing trial for a defendant mistakenly sent to prison as
a habitual offender.
   _Let stand a ruling in a Louisiana case that the federal Voting
Rights Act, designed to prevent racial discrimination, applies to
state judicial elections.
   _Agreed to consider the constitutionality of a Connecticut law
aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it
does in three neighboring states.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Texas whether investors' claims
against brokers must be settled by binding arbitration.
   _Agreed to use a case from Arkansas involving truckers and one
from Florida involving a liquor distributor to determine whether
states must refund taxes collected under laws later declared
unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez says the savings and
loan industry crisis would be his top priority as chairman of the
House Banking Committee, but analysts say his expected selection to
the post may might delay a solution.
   With the backing of House leaders, the 72-year-old Texas Democrat
is considered the most likely successor to Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I., defeated last week in his bid for a 15th term.
   Gonzalez, a hot-tempered, outspoken maverick, is urging swift
action before the poor condition of the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. becomes a ``chaotic crisis.''
   He advocates establishing a $50 billion line of credit from the
Treasury, to be partly repaid from the sale of loans and property
from failed S&Ls.
   ``Nobody wants a taxpayer bailout ... but there are limits to
what the industry can do and they've reached those limits,''
Gonzalez told the National Association of Mortgage Brokers on Monday.
   Gonzalez later told reporters, ``If it ever gets around that
there's nothing insuring those accounts and deposits, you could have
chaos.''
   Some analysts said they believed Gonzalez' sometimes
confrontational style could further fragment an already divided
House Banking Committee, thus complicating congressional efforts to
find a solution to the S&L industry crisis.
   ``He's bright. He understands problems and he can be very direct
with what he says,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
consultant in Alexandria, Va. ``But it's one thing to be able to
make cogent comments and it's another thing to be able to forge a
legislative compromise. That may be where he has problems.''
   A new banking chairman is also taking over in the Senate, where
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., is expected to succeed William
Proxmire, D-Wis., who is retiring.
   The new Bush administration likely will fill the leadership
vacuum left by the transition in Congress, according to R. Dan
Brumbaugh, a savings industry consultant and former chief economist
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   But, he added, ``it's hard not to believe this is going to slow
momentum.''
   Gonzalez, a 27-year veteran of Congress, gets high marks from
colleagues for personal integrity and a willingness to speak his
mind. They also say he is a likeable man, despite a temper that
caused him two years ago to slug a man who called him a communist.
   However, many question Gonzalez's ability to rein in his own
views enough to ride herd on a committee with more than 50 members
and nearly as many factions.
   In 1977, Gonzalez was appointed to chair a special committee to
investigate the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr. But within weeks he quit in a dispute with the chief
counsel, leaving the committee in turmoil.
   As chairman of the Banking subcommittee on housing since 1981,
Gonzalez has shown a confrontational style. He once called Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, the only black member
of the Reagan Cabinet, ``a Stepin Fetchit.''
   He also had advocated the impeachment of former Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker, who was pushing up interest rates in
the early 1980s to fight inflation.
   Former Rep. Henry A. Reuss, a Wisconsin Democrat who preceded St
Germain as banking committee chairman, says Gonzalez might do better
in the post than many expect.
   Under the Reagan administration it just has not been possible to
pass housing legislation, Reuss said, adding that Gonzalez has
``shown a capacity to learn and grow ... and I think that will stand
Congress in good stead.''
   Gonzalez discounted talk that he may be too rigid in his views.
   ``I've never considered myself an ideologue no matter how I've
been labeled,'' he said. ``You (can't) last in politics unless
you're in the traditional American vein of pragmatism.''
   He said much of the criticisms circulating are ``hobgoblins
calculatedly set forth by those who ... have ambitions themselves.''

   George Bush, just finished with a
two-mile run, bounded across the beach and threw himself into the
choppy waters. He caught a wave, body-surfed in and swam around a
while. Later he waded back in shoulder-deep to cast a fishing line
against the brisk waves.
   After an hour or so, he took a break to visit his mother and go
to church, then piloted a U.S. Customs power boat some 40 miles back
down the coast and leaped into the water for more fishing. Afterward
he played nine holes of golf.
   This was a typical vacation day for the 64-year-old man who takes
over the White House next Jan. 20.
   Bush showed during his four-day stay in this balmy beach
community that his idea of relaxation is physical activity. He
enjoys a variety of outdoor sports.
   One day he followed his morning jog with a trip out to a Coast
Guard cutter 400 yards offshore in a motorized raft. He jumped off
the cutter and swam part of the way in, then grabbed a rope off the
raft for an arm-numbing tow to shore against the choppy waters.
   White House physician Dr. Rodney Savage has pronounced Bush's
fitness ``exceptional for a man his age'' and expressed amazement at
his health and stamina.
   His loping walk is that of a younger man, and he moves around a
tennis court with an alacrity that makes up for his unimpressive
serve.
   In an Election Day match, he and son Marvin Bush played doubles
with son Jeb Bush and son-in-law Bill LeBlond in Houston, just hours
before Bush learned he had been elected president. The
president-to-be lunged for balls and zigzagged across the court,
energetic and clearly competitive with the younger men.
   Toward the end of his long presidential campaign, Bush complained
of physical fatigue, saying he missed having the time to jog, which
he said invigorates him. Often on the campaign trail he had a
stationary bicycle brought to his hotel room.
   Since the election, he seems to be making up for the inactivity
of long airplane rides and motorcades.
   Bush told reporters in a beachfront news conference that his
Friday-through-Tuesday morning vacation in Florida helped him clear
his mind.
   ``I've been able to run every day,'' he said. ``I love the
fishing. It doesn't matter what you catch, it's the fact you're out
there and fishermen know that. And so I'm still of the Isaac Walton
school, that the days I spend fishing should not be deducted from
the time I spend on earth.''

   A vegetarian diet, quitting cigarettes,
moderate exercise and up to an hour a day of yoga meditation can
help reverse heart disease symptoms without the use of drugs,
according to a California study.
   Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco, said that instead of using any drugs, his
program forced dramatic changes in lifestyle to bring a significant
improvement in the health of patients with coronary artery disease.
   The program is radical, he admits, but for the small group
tested, it worked.
   ``For many who have heart disease,'' said Ornish, ``the
conventional therapy (which includes drugs or surgery, some diet
revision and exercise) may not go far enough.''
   Ornish outlined his research in a paper presented Monday at the
annual meeting of the American Heart Association.
   He devised a strict program that started with a week of training
and preparation, a vegetarian diet that was less than 10 percent
fat, and 16 hours a week of group therapy. Patients who smoked were
required to quit. A moderate exercise program, usually walking, was
devised individually for each patient. And, to manage stress, the
patients were taught yoga meditation and relaxation exercises.
   To test the concept, Ornish put 50 patients with coronary artery
disease into two groups. All were tested to find the condition of
their arteries, how well their hearts were supplied with blood, and
the amount of cholesterol in their bloodstream. Cholesterol is a
fatty material in blood that can lead to clogged arteries.
   For those in the first group, Ornish provided the traditional
lifestyle care, which included some counseling on how to lower
cholesterol levels, controlling high blood pressure and quitting
smoking.
   The second group, however, was placed on what Ornish called ``a
very demanding regimen'' of lifestyle changes.
   ``We were asking them to make huge changes in their lifestyle and
then evaluated the effects'' using high technology X-ray and imaging
techniques, he said.
   The program started with a seven-day retreat during which the
patients were evaluated by a psychologist and by exercise experts.
They were taught how to use yoga to relieve stress, and were placed
on the strict diet.
   After the retreat, the group met for eight hours, two days a week
for instruction sessions in exercise, yoga and food preparation.
   ``We provided the low-fat food for some in take-home
containers,'' said Ornish. ``They found it was not as hard as you
would think. The group support goes a long way.''
   At the end of a year, 29 patients completed the testing analysis
_ 12 in the lifestyle changes group, and 17 in the ordinary care, or
control, group.
   For the control group, the arterial lesions, or clogging of
vessels supplying blood to heart, grew worse. Vessels that were 44.1
percent blocked closed further, to 46.2 percent blocked.
   For the lifestyle group, the progression of the disease was
halted and some arteries measurably opened up, providing additional
blood flow to the heart. They went from an average of 44.4 percent
blocked to 40.8 percent, a clear regression improvement in the
artery health, said Ornish.
   ``There was a significant decrease in blockages in the lifestyle
treatment group and a significant increase in blockages in the
control group,'' he said.
   Ornish said he used yoga and other stress control techniques
because earlier studies have shown ``emotional stress can play a
role in increasing and reducing lesions.''
   Also, he said, ``stress can increase cholesterol (in the
bloodstream) regardless of diet.'' Ornish said studies have shown,
for instance, that cholesterol rates go up for drivers during auto
races and for students during final examinations.
   ``Yoga is an ancient way of managing stress,'' said Ornish.
``It's very practical.'' He said patients were urged to meditate an
hour a day.
   Cholesterol counts in the treatment group declined from a median
of 227 milligrams per decaliter to 135, well below the recommended
maximum of 200.
   Patients in the study were aged 40 to 74, he said, and those who
were the sickest seemed to be helped the most.
   ``The blockages that were the most severe seem to improve the
greatest,'' said Ornish.
   The California scientist cautioned that though the results were
encouraging, they are preliminary, and that the number of patients
was too small to draw final conclusions on the value of the
treatment system.

<HEAD>Nobel Laureate Steps Up Criticism Of Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel laureate and
Soviet human rights activist, says Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is using ``undemocratic means'' in attempts to improve
conditions in their country.
   ``From my point of view this is dangerous,'' Sakharov said.
   He spoke Monday to a group of American intellectuals after
comparing notes on human rights and the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative with President Reagan at the White House.
   Today, Sakharov is scheduled to receive the Albert Einstein peace
prize and a $50,000 award for making ``an enormous impact on the
conscience of the world.''
   A nuclear physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb,
Sakharov has long been the principal human rights advocate in his
country. He was confined to virtual house arrest in Gorky for six
years until Gorbachev arranged his release in 1986.
   The Soviet leader also arranged for Sakharov's first visit to
America.
   But Sakharov, at a session Monday of the Woodrow Wilson Institute
for Scholars, said Gorbachev may not have a long-range program for
reform.
   He said Gorbachev improvises, and often ``compromises with
existing forces that negate his efforts.''
   Specifically, the Soviet nuclear physicist criticized Gorbachev's
consolidation of power, the absence of multi-party and free-market
systems as well as restrictions on meetings and demonstrations.
   ``There is no clear realization how this system should be
reformed,'' Sakharov said.
   In fact, he said, the partial reforms arranged by Gorbachev could
lead to ``disequilibrium.''
   Before leaving the Soviet Union on his first trip to the West,
Sakharov leveled similar criticisms at the Soviet president.
   Sakharov supports glasnost _ a term for openness that has marked
Gorbachev's 3{ years in power _ but complains that the Soviet leader
has accumulated too much power as both president and Communist party
chief.
   ``His tactic seems to be getting democratic reforms through
undemocratic means,'' Sakharov said. ``From my point of view this is
a dangerous action.''
   On the human rights front, Sakharov said some dissidents remain
in psychiatric institutions along with many more people who were
chronic critics of their employers.
   He called the detention system ``one of the most acute abuses''
in the Soviet Union.
   Earlier, Sakharov discussed the plight of dissidents with Reagan
at the White House.
   The president said until the problem is ``completely eliminated''
human rights will remain an irritant in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The 67-year-old Sakharov met with Reagan for about 20 minutes in
the Oval Office. They shared a cautious approach to the measures
taken by Gorbachev.
   Sakharov, mindful of reporters at a picture-taking session, drew
Reagan's attention to two dissidents, Vazif Meylanov and Mikhail
Kukobaka, who Sakharov said still are being held.
   He called the detention of Meylanov ``ironic'' since he was sent
to prison protesting the removal of Sakharov from Moscow to Gorky in
1980. ``I'm free to travel and he is in prison,'' the human rights
activist said.
   Sakharov, speaking through an interpreter, said Kukobaka is in
prison for refusing to bear false witness against a foreign diplomat.
   Reagan praised Gorbachev as more cooperative than any Kremlin
leader before him, but said ``we can only wait and see'' if the
Soviet leader makes good on a promise to release all political
prisoners.
   Sakharov told the president ``there are only individuals'' left
in jails, implying that Gorbachev, in principle at least, does not
adhere to a policy of detaining dissidents for their views.
   Sakharov, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, also voiced concern
about the impact that Reagan's missile defense program, known
popularly as Star Wars, might have on efforts by the superpowers to
negotiate a cut in long-range nuclear missile stockpiles.

<HEAD>Energy Department Corrects Natural Gas Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it overestimated how
much natural gas American industry has been using, a mistake that
had set off false alarms about the energy efficiency of the U.S.
economy.
   The error arose when a new reporting form confused many of the
companies that report gas deliveries to the department's Energy
Information Administration.
   EIA's quarterly publication ``Short Term Energy Outlook'' for
October, which reached users Monday, said the previous quarter's
estimates of industrial natural gas consumption in the first half of
1988 were about 8 percent too high.
   The agency started checking its statistics when the July edition
of its outlook reported a 26 percent first-half increase in
industrial gas use, implausibly high.
   In fact, the first half increase was about 6 percent to 3.13
trillion cubic feet.
   Natural gas is a major source of energy for home heating,
electricity generation, chemical manufacture and industrial process
heat. A little less than a quarter of all energy comes frm gas;
industrial gas use is about 8 percent of the total national energy
bill.
   Without the exaggerated natural gas changes, there would have
been no significant change in the estimated energy efficiency in the
economy, the closely watched ratio of energy used in producing a
dollar's worth of goods and services.
   Environmentalists use this as a rough indicator of damage to the
environment from economic activity; policymakers watch it as an
indication of future vulnerability to interruption of oil imports.
   Ken Brown, an EIA analyst, said the agency distributed new
reporting forms to gas companies delivering gas to industrial users
with the start of 1988. The new forms asked for physical deliveries
of gas no matter who owned it.
   The old forms required listing deliveries only of gas owned by
the reporting company, no matter who delivered it.
   Some companies continued to report the old way, which meant some
gas was counted twice _ once by the owner, once by the shipper.
   EIA said ``43 companies apparently have consistently misreported
their monthly'' deliveries, resulting in ``an overstatement of
industrial consumption in the first six months of 1988 of 0.5
trillion cubic feet.''
   Now that the errors have been corrected, the agency expects
industrial gas use of 6.15 trillion cubic feet for all of 1988, only
a 4.4 percent gain, instead of the 19 percent increase projected in
July on the basis of the overestimates.
   The energy crises of the 1970s prompted major efficiency
improvements everywhere. In the United States, for example, autos
averaged about 13 miles per gallon of gasoline in 1973; Congress
required 27.5 mpg by 1985, a goal since relaxed to 26 mpg.
   More efficient processes have continued to be introduced in
industry, and energy efficiency gains accelerated from an average of
1.2 percent per year in the 1970s to 2.8 percent in 1980-1986.
   But in 1987, for the first time in 11 years, efficiency failed to
improve, a stagnation many analysts attributed to the collapse in
oil prices of 1986.
   It took 19,960 British thermal units, or Btu, to produce a
dollar's worth of goods and services in 1987, measured in dollars of
1982 buying power. This was roughly the same as the 19,950 Btu of
1986.
   A Btu is a standard unit of energy, equal to the amount of heat
needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree
Fahrenheit.
   In July the agency forecast a 1988 ratio of 20,180 Btu per
dollar, or a 1.1 percent decline from 1987, and a 1989 ratio of
20,050, a 0.6 percent improvement from 1988.
   The corrected October forecast predicts 19,840 Btu per dollar, an
improvement of 0.6 percent from 1987, and improvement of 1.3 percent
to 19,590 Btu in 1989.
   One analyst, Alan Durning of the Worldwatch Institute, an
environmental research group, said, ``I could believe'' an
improvement of 0.6 percent.
   ``I would expect gains ... in the aggregate of about a half
percent per year, just from the technologies and how much room for
improvement there is, almost indefinitely,'' Durning said.
   But at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley,
Calif., analyst Lee Schipper said that even after the data
corrections, ``As far as I'm concerned that's no change. There's a
plateau. ... If I were a policymaker I'd be worried.''

<HEAD>Study Recommends New National Emphasis On Preserving Wetlands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major environmental study today recommended
that Congress set a national goal of reversing the centuries-old
trend of destroying more wetlands than are created.
   The report called on Congress to approve legislation encouraging
the formation of wetlands preservation trusts, perhaps by restoring
some tax incentives for land donations that were restricted by the
1986 tax law overhaul.
   The study group, called the National Wetlands Policy Forum, is
composed of state and federal government officials, industry
representatives and environmental interests. It was convened by the
Conservation Foundation, a private Washington-based research group,
at the request of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The report urged Congress to add wetlands restoration and
creation to the missions of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau
of Reclamation, the Soil Conservation Service, the Federal Highway
Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority and other agencies.
   It said these agencies, along with the Fish and Wildlife Service
and the National Marine Fisheries Service, should be required to
organize a major effort to seek out public lands for restoration,
especially where government activity had caused wetlands to be lost.
   Existing federal and state protective programs are ``too
cumbersome and the responsibilities too diffuse'' to guarantee
protection of wetlands, the report said.
   ``It is a system that allows hundreds of thousands of wetland
acres to continue to be lost or degraded annually, almost unnoticed,
while substantial resources and time often are devoted to
determining the fate of a few relatively small areas,'' it said.
   ``The fact that the protection of wetlands makes good economic as
well as environmental sense for society but not necessarily for the
individual owning them is central to much of the conflict over
wetlands protection policies,'' the report said.
   Setting a national goal of reversing the trend toward a shrinking
wetlands base ``does not imply that individual wetlands will in
every instance be untouchable.'' the report said. It said the aim
should be that ``the nation's overall wetlands base reach
equilibrium between losses and gains in the short run and increase
in the long term.''
   No one knows how fast swamps, marshes, bogs and other wetlands
are being lost at present, although the 200 million acres present at
the time Europeans settled what became the lower 48 states are
believed to have been cut in half through conversion to farms, urban
settlement and other uses.
   One study estimated that in the two decades leading up to 1975,
400,000 to 500,000 acres were lost every year.
   Only in recent decades has it become widely recognized that
wetlands serve important environmental functions by storing flood
water, supporting a third of the nation's endangered species,
nursing and spawning 60 percent to 90 percent of commercial fish
catches, reducing erosion, recharging groundwater, filtering
sediment and controlling pollution.
   ``At the extreme, as in the case of some migratory birds, habitat
functions can extend even to other continents,'' the report said.
   The report called on all states to enact wetlands conservation
legislation if they have not done so, and to draft plans showing how
they would meet goals of the forum report. Under the Clean Water
Act, the EPA could delegate many of its wetlands responsibilities to
states with approved plans.
   The Louisiana coast must get priority attention in considering a
search for public land for wetlands restoration, perhaps through
diversion of Mississippi River sediment into the region. The report
said the Louisiana coast is suffering ``extremely high wetlands
losses from erosion ... largely as a result of government flood
control and other water resource projects.''
   Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey served as chairman of the wetlands
policy forum, with Govs. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and
Booth Gardner of Washington as vice chairmen.

   The Soviet space shuttle Buran touched down on a
concrete runway in Soviet Central Asia on Tuesday morning,
flawlessly ending its unmanned 3 hour, 25 minute maiden voyage,
Radio Moscow said.
   ``The U.S.S.R. has successfuly tested its first reusable space
craft Buran,'' the official radio said.
   ``The unmanned shuttle has just landed on a special runway near
the Baikonur Space Center,'' it said, interrupting its regular
programming.
   The delta-winged Buran, Russian for snowstorm, had orbited Earth
twice, lifting off on schedule despite a cold rain. The official
Tass news agency said the shuttle landed exactly on schedule.
   A previous attempt to launch the Buran had been frustrated by
last-minute technical troubles.
   The shuttle was launched at 6 a.m. Moscow time (10 p.m. Monday
EST) in yellow flame and clouds of white steam from the special
launch site in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Forty-seven
minutes later it reached orbit, firing its own rockets for the first
time.
   The U.S. shuttle lookalike completed two orbits and then returned
to the 2.7-mile concrete landing strip eight miles from its launch
pad.
   Before liftoff, technicians had been concerned that the Buran and
Energia might get covered with a coat of ice.

   The Soviet space shuttle Buran touched down Tuesday
morning on a concrete runway in Soviet Central Asia, flawlessly
ending its unmanned 3-hour, 25-minute maiden flight, Radio Moscow
said.
   Buran had flown twice around Earth on fully automatic control,
then landed at the special 2.7-mile concrete runway eight miles from
its launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
   ``The U.S.S.R. has successfuly tested its first reusable space
craft Buran,'' Radio Moscow said, interrupting its regular
programming.
   A previous attempt to launch the Buran had been frustrated by
last-minute technical troubles.
   An escort plane followed the shuttle as it approached the runway,
tracking the last moments of the flight with special optical and
television equipment. The official news agency Tass said the shuttle
systems of the Buran, or snowstorm in Russian, were tested during
the completely automated flight.
   In yellow flame and clouds of steam, the delta-winged Buran
lifted off on schedule at 6 a.m. Moscow time (10 p.m. EST) despite a
cold rain, indicating there had been no hitches in the automated
countdown and launch.
   The engines of Buran were fired twice about three-quarters of an
hour later after it had separated from its booster Energia, and the
craft reached orbit exactly on schedule, Soviet media said.
   There was no live broadcast of the liftoff, but 90 minutes later
Soviet television showed its first film. The shuttle, attached to
Energia and four first-stage rockets, lifted slowly off its pad in
the early morning dark.
   Controllers were shown applauding the launch and green computer
screens showed the flight trajectory.
   The craft's own engines were fired for the first time at an
altitude of 99 miles to nudge it into orbit with its left wing
facing Earth.
   Before liftoff, technicians had been concerned that the Buran and
Energia might get covered with a coat of ice.
   ``If the wind rises into a squall and the orbital vehicle (and)
Energia become covered with a crust of ice, then launch time will be
changed again,'' said correspondent Sergei Slipchenko, referring to
a failed attempt to launch Buran last month.
   U.S. officials won't launch the American space shuttle if there
is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter, and cold temperatures
contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the
Challenger disaster in January 1986.
   The radio report said the flight would be long enough to check
out all the shuttle systems and determine when a manned flight is
feasible.
   Technicians began fueling the 198-foot Energia, the world's most
powerful booster, with nearly 2,000 tons of liquid hydrogen, oxygen
and kerosene, Radio Moscow reported Monday night.
   Launch had been set for Oct. 29, but the countdown was halted
with 51 seconds left when an access arm failed to pull far enough
away from the space craft. Officials said Monday they redesigned the
joint and expected no more trouble from it.
   The United States flew its first shuttle, the Columbia, in 1981,
and for years the Soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and
unreliable. But Western space specialists say the Soviets began
planning their space plane in 1982 at the latest.
   Few technical details have been made public about the Buran, a
lookalike to the U.S. shuttle, and state-run media have only
indirectly indicated its cost.
   ``Comparing the cost of the Buran program and that of the similar
U.S. shuttle program ($10 billion), newspapers say they are
approximately identical,'' Tass reported.
   The Buran can carry up to 10 cosmonauts, Tass said.
   Alexander I. Dunaev, chief of the commercial Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, told reporters Thursday the maiden flight of the 100-ton
Buran will show the Soviets if they are ready to begin manned
shuttle missions.
   The Soviets have cited the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the
Challenger, which killed all seven crewmembers aboard, as an example
of the hazards they are trying to avoid.
   Dunaev said the Buran and ``several'' additional shuttles planned
by the Soviets will have a different role than their U.S.
equivalents, which were designed to ferry payloads into orbit.
   The Buran and its sister craft will be used to park satellites in
space ``only in exceptional cases,'' Dunaev said, since the use of
shuttles for that purpose costs ``tens, even hundreds of times''
more than conventional booster rockets.
   ``Soviet reusable spaceships will be used, first of all, for the
accomplishment of tasks involved in the operation of space
technology: maintenance operations and recovery of worn-out
satellites,'' he said.
   The Soviets repeatedly have criticized the military uses of the
U.S. shuttle, but the Pentagon says the Soviet spacecraft could be
used to deploy killer satellites, ballistic missile defense weapons
and other military uses.
   The Energia, which can lift a 220,000-pound payload, rivals the
power of America's huge Saturn 5 rocket, which was scrapped for
economy reasons after taking Apollo crews to the moon.

   The U.S. dollar firmed against the Japanese yen
Tuesday while share prices soared to a record high.
   The dollar opened at 123.60 yen, and traded in a range of
123.15-123.72 yen before closing at 123.25 yen, up 0.25 yen from the
previous day's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which closed at
a record 28,520.90 points Monday, gained another 308.51 points, or
1.07 percent, to close at 28,829.41, its highest close ever.
   Traders said continued intervention by Japan's central bank early
Tuesday morning helped brake the U.S. currency's recent fall against
the yen.
   The scale of intervention was considered small, but enough to
show monetary officials are determined to stem the dollar's slide,
they said.
   The central bank does not publicly comment on its activities,
although market sources said that on Monday it bought an estimated
$500 million in Tokyo in an attempt to stem the currency's rapid
plunge.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference Tuesday
that there would be cooperative intervention with other major
monetary nations in the currency market if rates again prove
unstable.
   An exchange dealer with a major commercial bank, speaking
anonymously, said market players were keenly awaiting the release of
U.S. monthly trade figures for September, scheduled for Wednesday in
Washington.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which closed at
a record 28,520.90 points Monday, was up 262.15 points from that
close to finish the morning session at 28,783.05.
   Share prices were broadly higher during the morning session on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said.
   ``Large capital issues, including steels and shipbuildings, are
heading upward after recent sessions of weakness,'' Seiichiro Kita
of Daiwa Securities said.

   U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson says he was thinking of the
Challenger astronauts' families, not about any cover-up concerning
the shuttle explosion, when he intervened in a dispute over the
astronauts' remains.
   ``It's the last thing in the wake of an American tragedy (that)
there should be a bureaucratic turf fight over who's going to
possess the remains of the seven dead astronauts,'' Nelson said
Monday. ``That simply was not right in the context of the national
tragedy we were all suffering, and it was not right for the families
of the seven astronauts.
   ``If I had to do it all over again, I would do it exactly the
same way,'' he said at a news conference.
   A story published Sunday in The Miami Herald's Tropic magazine
said Nelson, a Florida Democrat who chairs the House Space Science
Subcommittee, acted at NASA's behest in calling Brevard County
Medical Examiner Laudie McHenry and telling him to drop his office's
contention that the autopsies should be performed by Brevard
authorities.
   The article implied Nelson's actions were part of an alleged NASA
cover-up aimed at preventing the public from knowing that the
astronauts likely were alive until the Challenger slammed into the
ocean on Jan. 28, 1986. Autopsy reports from the county office would
have been public record.
   Nelson denied the story's report that George Abbey, head of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Astronaut Office,
called him to ask him to intervene in the autopsy dispute. Nelson
said he called Abbey in March 1986 to tell him he thought the
dispute was inappropriate and that he would call the Brevard medical
examiner.
   In Houston on Monday, the wives of Challenger astronauts Mike
Smith and Ellison Onizuka said they weren't surprised to read
speculation that crew members may have been alive during the
2{-minute free fall into the Atlantic Ocean, but that the Tropic
article was distressing.
   ``I think I always felt that Mike was alive because his PEAP
(personal emergency air pack) was found still attached to his seat
... breathed down three-fourths of the way, which was the same
amount of time that it would've taken to impact,'' Jane Smith said
at a news conference.
   ``It was in the on position and it is used only on demand, so he
had to be breathing in order to receive the air. I have known in my
heart always, I felt strongly that he was alive until that time.''
   Added Lorna Onizuka: ``I don't know if anything was covered up, I
hope not. It was an incident that nobody was prepared for ... or how
to handle it when it did happen.''
   Nelson, an astronaut aboard the last shuttle mission before
Challenger, said the astronauts' remains had been recovered in
international waters and taken to the Air Force Institute of
Pathology, and as far as he was concerned a presidential executive
order signed in February gave the independent Rogers Commission the
jurisdiction for all aspects of the Challenger investigation.
   Nelson said McHenry agreed with him, attributing the dispute to
an assistant medical examiner. McHenry's office said he was
unavailable for comment Monday.
   NASA officials denied they were trying to cover up details of the
astronauts' deaths.
   ``We've made every effort to determine the cause and time of
death but have never been able to pin it down,'' NASA spokesman Ken
Atchison said Monday in Washington.
   Nelson said that if there were lingering doubts about the
Challenger disaster, his subcommittee would hold new hearings. But,
he said, the possibility that the astronauts were alive until impact
wasn't new.

   Musicians of the Hartford Symphony
Orchestra voted overwhelmingly to reject a contract offer, extending
a 7-week-old strike.
   The musicians, members of Greater Hartford Musicians Union Local
400, voted 54-3 on Monday to reject the contract offer. The strike
began Sept. 22.
   ``Part of the problem we have been facing is the orchestra
management is rather conservative in that they are unwilling to look
for other avenues of additional funding,'' said William D.
Steinberg, president of the union.
   Morton Handel, president of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra,
called the contract offer ``fair and equitable.''
   Handel said the orchestra's 34 part-time musicians, who are paid
on a per service basis, were offered 6 percent pay increases during
each year of a three-year contract. Steinberg said, however, the pay
increases would be tempered by a salary cut for the 21 full-time
musicians.

   Here, at a glance, are key developments related
to President-elect George Bush's preparations for taking over as
chief executive:
   _On the eve of his return today to Washington, Bush had dinner at
a Florida beachfront vacation home with New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu, a top campaign adviser mentioned as a candidate for White
House chief of staff.
   _Leaders of the Bush transition team said he wants to assemble
his presidential economic team quickly. He is expected to retain his
longtime friend Nicholas Brady as Treasury secretary. Others are
expected to be former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman as
budget director and Stanford University professor Michael Boskin as
White House economics adviser.
   Bush aides said that a list of three to five names is being drawn
up for him to consider for each Cabinet post.
   _Vice President-elect Dan Quayle announced he intends to resign
his Senate seat in time to give his successor a jump in seniority
over the new class of lawmakers being sworn in Jan. 3. Quayle said
he had ``no recommendations'' to make on a successor when he met
privately with Indiana Gov. Robert Orr, who will make the
appointment.
   _The next chairman of the House Budget Committee said tax
increases will be needed next year to make legally required cuts in
the deficit. ``Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size
of the challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.

<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts of the official
English translation of the ``Declaration of Independence,'' which
was read in Arabic by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat today:
   ``When in the course of modern times a new order of values was
declared with norms and values fair for all, it was the Arab
Palestinian people who were excluded from the destiny of all other
peoples by a hostile array of local and foreign powers. ...
   ``Despite the historical injustice inflicted on the Arab
Palestinian people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them
of their right to self-determination, following U.N. General
Assembly resolution 181 (1947), which partitioned Palestine into two
states, one Arab and one Jewish, yet it is this resolution that
still provides those conditions of international legitimacy that
ensure the right of the Arab Palestine people to sovereignty and
national independence.
   ``By stages, the occupation of Palestine and parts of other Arab
territories by Israeli forces, the willed dispossession and
expulsion from their ancestral homes of the majority of Palestine's
civilian inhabitants was achieved by organized terror. Those who
remained, as a vestige subjugated in its homeland, were persecuted
and forced to endure the destruction of their national life. ...
   ``The intefadeh (Arabic for uprising) has set siege to the mind
of official Israel, which has for too long relied exclusively upon
myth and terror to deny Palestinian existence altogether. Because
the intefadeh and its revolutionary irreversible impulse, the
history of Palestine has therefore arrived at a decisive juncture.
   ``In pursuance of resolutions adopted by Arab summit conferences
and relying on the authority bestowed by international legitimacy as
embodied in the resolutions of 1947;
   ``And in exercise by the Arab Palestinian people of their right
to self-determination, political independence and sovereignty over
their territory. ...
   ``The Palestine National Council, in the name of God, and in the
name of the Arab Palestinian people, hereby proclaims the
establishment of the state of Palestine on our Palestinian territory
with Jerusalem as its capital.
   ``The state of Palestine is the state of Palestinians, wherever
they may be. The state is for them to enjoy in it their collective
natural and cultural identity, theirs to pursue in it a complete
equality of rights. In it will be safeguarded their political and
religious beliefs and their human dignity under a democratic
parliamentary system, based on freedom of expression and multiple
parties. The rights of the minorities will duly be respected by the
majority, as minorities must abide by decisions of the majority.
Governance will be based on principles of social justice, equality
and non-discrimination in public rights of men or women, on the
grounds of race, religion, color or sex under the aegis of a
constitution which ensures the rule of law and an independent
judiciary.
   ``Thus shall these principles allow no departure from Palestine's
age-old spiritual and civilizational heritage of tolerance and
religious coexistence.
   ``The state of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and
indivisible part of the Arab nation, at one with that nation in
heritage and civilization. ...
   ``The state of Palestine proclaims its commitment to the
principles and purposes of the United Nations, and to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It proclaims its commitment as well to
the principles and policies of the Non-Aligned Movement. ...
   ``The state of Palestine herewith declares that it believes in
the settlement of regional and international disputes by peaceful
means, in accordance with the U.N. Charter and resolutions ...
   ``Therefore, on this blessed day, November 15, 1988, as we stand
on the threshold of a new dawn ... we humbly bow to the sacred
spirits of our fallen martyrs. ...''

   The Palestine National Council is a
450-member bicameral parliament-in-exile with members selected from
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla factions and
professional unions.
   The council elects the PLO's ruling 15-man executive committee,
sets out the committee's policy, distributes finances to the
movement's seven departments and regulates relations with
governments and other organizations.
   In short, it is the Palestinians' supreme decision-making body.
   The council is led by Sheik Abdel-Hamid Sayeh, a 78-year-old
Moslem priest who was deported from the Israeli-occupied West Bank
after the 1967 Middle East war.
   The parliament is supposed to convene annually, but the executive
committee may call special sessions for internal, regional or
international developments.
   Another body, the Central Council, meets regularly. Its 70
members, who include the executive committee members, oversee
implementation of PNC resolutions.
   The PLO council first was formed in Jerusalem in 1964.
   After the 1967 war when Israeli took control of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, 100 additional members were added to allow
representation of the Gaza area, which had been under Egyptian rule.
   When east Jerusalem was occupied, the council moved to Cairo,
Egypt, where it drafted the PLO charter in 1968.
   Arab governments endorsed the guerrilla movement as the ``sole,
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people'' in a summit
the same year.
   After Egypt signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel in
1979, the council moved out of Cairo. Since then, the PNC has held
sessions in Syria, Jordan and Algeria.
   There are independent council members and those designated by PLO
factions and unions such as those representing students, lawyers and
women.
   Independents occupy 199 seats. The rest are distributed to the 10
unions and guerrilla factions.
   Council decisions also are made by majority vote.
   Fatah, the PLO's largest faction which is headed by Yasser
Arafat, has 55 seats, the largest block in the council.
   About 80 percent to 85 percent of the delegates are aligned with
Arafat.

   Soviet officials, who once criticized the American
space shuttle as wasteful and unreliable, joined the shuttle
business today with a craft that looks conspiciously like its U.S.
predecessor.
   The official Tass news agency even acknowledged similarities
between the crafts after its space plane, the Buran, made its maiden
unmanned flight today.
   ``In appearance the Buran resembles the U.S. space shuttle, which
has the same streamlined forms and double-delta wing _ the laws of
aerodynamics are international,'' it said.
   Despite the similarity in appearance and design, however, the
Soviets seem to have settled on different uses for their shuttle,
named the Buran, which is Russian for snowstorm.
   For years, the Soviets wouldn't even admit they were developing
their own shuttle, though Western specialists date the program back
to at least 1982.
   In June 1980, 10 months before the United States launched its
first shuttle, the Columbia, the chief of Soviet cosmonaut training,
Vladimir A. Shatalov, said Soviet officials ``consider that the
employment of these spacecraft is not justified for Soviet research
because present tasks can be solved with the well-tested methods in
an economical way.''
   Former cosmonaut Konstantin P. Feoktistov, writing in 1984 in a
Soviet newspaper, praised the American shuttle as ``an impressive
engineering achievement.'' But, he added, ``this system is not sound
economically and technologically.''
   Soviet officials appeared to become believers after settling on a
different focus for their shuttle than the one NASA chose.
   The U.S. shuttle was designed primarily to ferry satellites into
orbit. But Alexander I. Dunayev, the head of the Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, said in 1987 that shuttles are not as economical as
single-use rocket boosters for placing satellites into orbit.
   In the clearest hint of the Soviet shuttle's purpose, he said
such craft are valuable for servicing space stations and satellites
and recovering objects from orbit.
   The reasoning seems sound because ever since they pioneered space
flight with the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviets have forged a
proven track record for launching satellites on single-use rockets.
They put up more than 150 satellites a year, more than any other
country.
   In addition, the Soviets have concentrated on maintaining a
permanent manned presence in space aboard the orbiting space station
Mir. While Soviet officials have not said whether the shuttle is
capable of doing so, the shuttle might be able to ferry supplies and
cosmonauts to Mir.
   The Buran might also have the capability to retrieve and repair
potentially dangerous satellites in orbit.
   The Soviets have repeatedly criticized the military use of the
American shuttle, and the next American flight, of the Atlantis in
late November, is a mission for the Pentagon.
   But as with the American shuttle, the Soviets might use the Buran
for military missions. The U.S. Defense Department says the Soviet
shuttle could be used to deploy anti-satellite and ballistic missile
defense weapons.
   It isn't clear whether the Soviets will try to market their
shuttle's services to foreign customers, as they have done with
their Proton rocket boosters. If foreign customers are sought,
competition will come not only from the United States but from
Western Europe.
   The European Space Agency hopes to have its version of the
shuttle, the Hermes, on the launch pad in the late 1990s.
   The Buran clearly has advantages over its American cousin. Its
separate booster rocket, the Energia, is powered only by liquid
fuels, which can be extinguished in an emergency. It has no
solid-fuel boosters like the one that failed on the Challenger,
killing seven crewmembers.
   In addition, the Soviet shuttle can use jet engines in its tail,
giving it more maneuverability in landing than its American
counterpart.
   The Buran can also carry far heavier payloads than the American
shuttle. Energia can hoist more than 100 tons, and the orbiter
itself can carry about 66,000 pounds. The U.S. shuttle can carry
about 55,000 pounds.
   While Soviet officials maintain they did not copy the American
shuttle, the Pentagon has a different view.
   ``By using U.S. propulsion, computer, materials and airframe
technology and design, the Soviets were able to produce an orbiter
years earlier, and at far less cost, than if they had depended
solely on their own technology and engineering,'' the Defense
Department said in its 1988 report Soviet Military Power.

   A private Latin American collector paid nearly
$25 million at auction for an early Pablo Picasso painting of a
mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th
century work of art.
   ``Maternity,'' from the artist's blue period, sold Monday at
Christie's for twice its estimate, making it the third-highest price
ever paid for a work of art, behind Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
and ``Sunflowers.''
   The 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 post-Impressionist and
modern works on sale from the collection of William Goetz, a
Hollywood motion picture executive, and his wife Edith, the daughter
of film mogul, Louis B. Mayer.
   The 28 lots, all of which sold, fetched $85,024,500 _ a record
for a single owner's sale at auction.
   ``This may well be the sale of the century,'' said Christie's
president Christopher J. Burge, who presided over the auction.
   ``Tonight's auction was ripe for success _ unsurpassingly
beautiful works of art, a fiercely competitive market, and a
renowned provenance,'' he said.
   Earlier, Burge had predicted that the sale would fetch about $50
million.
   The Goetzes built their collection _ generally considered one of
the best of its kind _ during the 1940s and 1950s. Until this
summer, their paintings hung in their Holmby Hills mansion in
California, where the couple once entertained lavishly. He died in
1969; she died in June at the age of 82.
   After intense bidding, ``Maternity'' sold to an unidentified
Latin American collector, whose winning bid was placed by telephone.
The painting was expected to sell for $10 million.
   It depicts a blue-robed mother in a high-backed chair, with a
scissors and sewing basket at her feet. The child, standing next to
her, has a ball in his hands.
   The auction house described the painting as a ``majestic, tender
but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love.''
   ``It's a great, very rare picture,'' Burge said. ``It was a
unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture'' of
Picasso's, who painted it when he was 20, he added.
   When Burge brought the hammer down on the $24.75 million bid, the
crowd broke into applause.
   ``Irises'' sold for $53.9 million in November 1987. A few months
earlier, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million.
   The second-highest priced work sold at Monday's auction was
Claude Monet's ``The Beach at Trouville,'' an 1870 oil on canvas,
which went for $10.78 million.
   The third-highest priced piece was Edgar Degas' ``Little Dancer
At 14 Years,'' a statue that sold for $10,175,000, a new record for
the artist. The statue depicts a dancer in polychromed bronze; she
wears a muslin skirt and her hair is tied with a satin ribbon.
   Eight artist's records were set during the auction; they were for
Picasso, Degas, Pierre Bonnard, Henri Fantin-Latour, Marie
Laurencin, Alfred Sisley, Chaim Soutine and Edouard Vuillard.
   All prices include a 10 percent commission paid by the buyer to
the auction house.

   Community leaders and civil rights
activists expressed outrage at the beating death of a black man by
white youths believed to be ``skinheads,'' and one group called on
citizens to take direct action.
   Sunday's slaying was the nation's third linked to the bands of
young toughs who promote white supremacy. Skinheads, whose name is
derived from their shaved heads, have been linked to numerous
criminal acts against blacks, Asians, Jews and homosexuals
nationwide.
   Two other black men were injured in the attack by three young
men, who had shaved heads and wore military jackets. The three
victims were Ethiopian immigrants.
   Mayor Bud Clark said in a statement Monday he was ``saddened and
disturbed'' by the beatings, and urged citizens and public officials
to find a constructive solution to racial violence.
   ``A cowardly act against any one of our citizens is a cowardly
act against every one of our citizens,'' City Commissioner Bob Koch
said at a news conference. ``But let us not react out of hatred. Let
us react with love and understanding.''
   The militant Jewish Defense Organization mailed letters to
Portland synagogues asking them to arm their congregations.
   ``Violence will be met with violence,'' said Mordechai Levy, head
of the 3,000-member group based in New York.
   He said a $10,000 reward was being offered for information about
the beatings, or to anyone who physically restrains a neo-Nazi from
doing violence against a minority group.
   Police spokesman Dave Simpson said Monday that investigators had
no leads in finding the men who attacked Mulugeta Seraw, 27,
Wondwosen Tesfaye, 24, and Tilahule Antneh, 31. He said they may be
skinheads.
   Seraw was pronounced dead at Emanuel Hospital & Health Center,
where the two survivors were treated and released.
   Portland's African community planned a memorial service for
Seraw, who emigrated from Ethiopia seven years ago and worked at a
car rental agency.
   ``This is really kind of sad, for somebody to be looking for
someone with dark skin,'' said Abdi Hassan, who teaches a course on
southern Africa at Portland State University. ``No one is safe,
really, and it's a scary thought.''
   About 2,000 skinheads are active in 21 states, according to a
report issued last month by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, which surveys race- or religion-motivated crimes.
   The Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment last month
identified Oregon as a ``hotbed'' of skinhead activity. In Portland,
skinheads have been linked to various acts of vandalism and at least
two assaults, including the beating of an Asian man in March.
   Portland and the Northwest are ripe for such activity because so
few members of minority groups live here, said Herman Brame,
executive assistant for the Black United Fund. The Northwest has
been targeted by white supremacist groups as the site for an Aryan
``homeland.''
   Asked if Portland police were tracking skinhead activity, Simpson
would say only that the police intelligence unit ``is aware of some
of their activities.''
   ``Being a gang member isn't against the law. We deal with people
who violate the law,'' he said.
   Antneh and Tesfaye told police they were dropping Seraw off at
his apartment in a primarily white neighborhood early Sunday when
three men and two women pulled up in a car.
   The three men beat Seraw with a baseball bat and kicked him,
Antneh said, and beat the other two when they tried to intervene. He
said the attack lasted no more than two minutes.
   ``The women inside the car were shouting. They were saying `Let's
kill him. Kick him,''' Antneh told The Oregonian newspaper. ``They
(the men) never said anything. They just jumped us.''
   Skinheads were suspected in the beating death last December of a
41-year-old black man in Tampa, Fla., and the stabbing death in

<HEAD>State Attorney General Seeks Enforcement Of Insurance-Cutting
Proposition</HEAD>

   A ballot question that cuts insurance rates
20 percent should take effect while the state Supreme Court
considers insurance industry lawsuits seeking to void it, says state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   California voters passed Proposition 103 last week, but lawsuits
filed immediately by insurance companies claim the rate rollback for
car, home and business insurance is unconstitutional.
   Van de Kamp asked the court Monday to withdraw the order it
issued last Thursday blocking enforcement of the initiative.
Residents who voted for the proposition believed they would see
immediate insurance rate relief, he said in papers filed with the
court.
   ``That expectation should not be frustrated without giving the
initiative a fair chance to work,'' he said.
   The attorney general's brief said insurers are unlikely to win
their suits against the initiative and have not shown that they
would suffer ``irreparable injury'' if Proposition 103 were allowed
to take effect while the insurance suits were pending.
   But if the court did not want to go as far as withdrawing its
order, Van de Kamp said, it should let all Proposition 103's
provisions take effect except for the rate rollback and require
insurance companies to set aside enough money to lower their
premiums if they lose their case.
   Members of Voter Revolt, a group that backed Proposition 103,
said Monday they didn't have enough money to enter the case now but
were starting a fund-raising drive to pay for a later court
intervention.
   Proposition 103, which was fiercely opposed by insurers and
passed by a narrow margin, requires insurance rates to be reduced to
20 percent below their November 1987 level. It also requires a
freeze at that level until November 1989, when auto insurance rates
would be cut an additional 20 percent for motorists with good
driving records.
   In addition, the measure includes an exemption from the rollback
for insurers who could show a ``substantial threat of insolvency,''
and conversion of the state insurance commissioner from an appointed
to an elected office in 1990.
   The measure allows the insurance commissioner to consider an
insurer's financial situation in granting exemptions from the 20
percent rollback and in reviewing future rate increase applications.
   Insurance companies argue that the rollback violates their
constitutional property rights by denying them the ability to make a
fair profit.
   Insurers spent at least $60 million fighting Proposition 103 and
other rate reduction initiatives on the ballot and promoting an
unsuccessful no-fault auto insurance initiative. It was the most
costly state proposition fight in the nation's history.
   Since the election, several insurers said they would no longer do
business in California. In the latest announcement, State Farm
Mutual Auto Insurance Co., the state's largest home and auto
insurer, said it has stopped issuing new policies in the state.
   Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, Allstate Insurance Co. said Monday
it would become the third major insurer in two years to stop writing
new auto insurance policies in that state, where insurers say strict
regulation of rates prevents them from making a profit.
   Allstate lost $115 million in Massachusetts over the past five
years, largely as a result of the ``unique regulatory environment''
for auto insurance, said Kevin Sullivan, director of Allstate's
Group Auto division.

<HEAD>Back On The Job, Dukakis Tackles State Budget</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defeated presidential candidate Michael Dukakis,
declaring he is ``back and rarin' to go,'' acknowledged his state
faces financial problems but denied they were aggravated by his
20-month campaign.
   ``We face major challenges,'' Dukakis told a jammed news
conference on Monday, promising to balance the current $11.6 billion
state budget when the fiscal year ends next June.
   As he did on the campaign trail, he refused to rule out new state
taxes. But, he said, ``I hope we can avoid them.''
   Dukakis admitted that the presidential race ``took some of my
attention away,'' but he said other states are facing the same
fiscal problems. ``I'm back and rarin' to go,'' he added.
   During his conference at the Massachusetts Statehouse, Dukakis
appeared rested after his first weekend of rest in months. The
defeated Democrat ducked reporters' questions about his political
future.
   ``It's too early to tell. I'm back at a job I love. I'm
challenged by it,'' Dukakis said, promising to make a decision on
his plans ``sometime next year.''
   Last Wednesday, Dukakis held a day-after news conference to
assess his unsuccessful campaign. At the time, he said he planned to
continue the fight for the national agenda his campaign stressed,
but he would not speculate on a possible second run for the
presidency in 1992.
   On the campaign trail, President-elect George Bush challenged
Dukakis' credentials as a fiscal manager by brandishing a copy of a
tabloid Boston newspaper featuring a front-page story on the state's
borrowing to pay its bills under the banner headline ``What a Mess!''
   Dukakis refused to characterize the state's fiscal condition and
declined to specify the size of the shortfall in the current $11.6
billion budget. Moments later, however, his top budget official
testified at a House oversight hearing and admitted that the state
is lacking at least $282 million.
   ``We are in a very difficult two-year period here,'' the governor
said, citing the continuing impact on state finances of federal tax
changes. He said New York, California and other states were facing
similar problems.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Group Not Sufficiently Pressuring Nicaragua On Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Addressing the annual meeting of
the Organization of American States, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz criticized its members for not doing more to pressure
Nicaragua into democratic reforms.
   ``This organization has not always been out front on issues
concerning democracy,'' he said in the meetings' keynote speech.
   Shultz said Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government had
promised the OAS it would maintain a ``pluralistic'' political
system, but that member states had not held the Nicaraguans to their
commitment.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's vice-minister of foreign affairs,
disagreed.
   ``The general movement is towards discussion, towards
negotiation,'' he said during an informal press conference. ``The
OAS has started to take a political role in ending the Central
American crisis.''
   Tinoco noted that Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares has agreed
to a direct role in monitoring a now-stalled peace agreement between
the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateral
truce declared for the duration of the session by leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas opposed to the government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte.
   Duarte, in welcoming the delegates, condemned the guerrillas and
called for support for the overall Central American peace process,
   Other topics discussed at the General Assembly included Latin
American debt, the U.S. concern with drug trafficking and the OAS's
own financial straits.
   The OAS is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behind
on their dues. The United States, which provides the OAS
headquarters in Washington, owes $41 million.
   ``The member governments must decide what they want to do with
the OAS at this critical juncture in the life of the Americas,''
said Baena Soares, lamenting the organization's ``critical economic
condition.''
   The Brazilian was re-elected by acclamation to a second five-year
term as OAS secretary-general.
   An OAS commission has recommended that the group cut its $66
million annual budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of about 1,000
staff members.
   Delegates to the General Assembly will decide whether to accept
that recommendation this week.
   Shultz, who will be replaced by James A. Baker when
President-elect George Bush takes office in January, said he would
press for full funding by the U.S. Congress.
   The U.S. failure to pay its full contribution has been
interpreted by some Latin nations as an effort to reassert its
dominance over the OAS.
   ``The OAS's original sin is that it was founded to further U.S.
aims in Latin America,'' Tinoco said. ``But other countries are
trying to contribute a little more.''
   Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman who came to San Salvador to
press the rebels' case, questioned Tinoco's motives.
   ``They want negotiations on a biblical time scale _ to last a
thousand years,'' he told The Associated Press. ``They only want to
stretch things out to reinforce their grip.''
   At a news conference after his speech, Shultz pointed to the
exclusion of Panama from a meeting of Latin American nations last
month as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could be
taken by OAS nations.
   Panama, Shultz noted pointedly, was excluded from the ``Group of
Eight'' because it was no longer a democracy while under Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's thumb.
   In another speech to the assembly, Chile's foreign minister
Felipe Errazuriz reiterated the intention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
government to hold elections in 1989. However, he said, terrorism
was the major menace to the democratic process in Chile.

<HEAD>NBC and CBS Declare Promo `War' on ABC Epic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC and CBS declared a tongue-in-cheek promo
``war'' on ABC's mammoth World War II miniseries, ``War and
Remembrance,'' but were nevertheless relieved and surprised when its
first night didn't do as well as expected.
   ABC expressed disappointment in the prelminary ratings for
Sunday's opening episode, even though the first installment of the
18-hour, seven-part first half of the $110 million miniseries won
the night. It only got a 34 share _ or percentage of the viewing
audience _ compared to the 53 share for ``The Winds of War'' in
1983. ``War and Remembrance,'' based on Herman Wouk's novel, is a
sequel to ``The Winds of War.''
   ``We're a little surprised at the first night's viewing levels,
but it's quality viewing at its finest, and we're very proud of
it,'' ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said Monday.
   ABC estimated 50 million people watched the opening installment.
Another 14 hours or so of ``War and Remembrance'' will run on ABC
sometime next year. The length of the miniseries was a target of
NBC's and CBS' counter-advertising.
   An NBC promo asked viewers to weigh ``a World War II movie that
doesn't end'' against NBC's lighter fare, including a TV movie
starring Vanna White.
   ``The tricky thing is you don't want to use your airwaves to hype
something on another network in order to say there's an alternative.
We have a couple of spots that we've held back on,'' said NBC
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff.
   One of those he described as similar to the old Alka-Seltzer
commercials in which gorged Americans marveled, ``I can't believe I
ate the whole thing.''
   ``Don't be a prisoner of war in your own living room,'' said a
CBS ad that promoted CBS stars.
   ``I think there are things you can get away with, with humor,''
said CBS spokesman George Schweitzer. ``We were not disparaging the
competition, and we will never belittle or disparage the
competition. But tongue-in-cheek humor is acceptable when it works.''
   The first part of the epic miniseries was rushed on the air this
month because the writers' strike delayed production on ABC's new
series.
   In the 17 largest TV markets, ``War and Remembrance'' had a
rating of 23.8 on Sunday night. NBC ran the hit theatrical movie
``Back to the Future'' and got an 18.1 and a 26 share. CBS had an
11.4 and 16 with a made-for-TV comedy Western, ``Where the Hell's
the Gold?''
   The 18-hour ``The Winds of War'' averaged a 38.6 rating.
   The rating is a percentage of all homes with televisions in the
markets measured. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   ABC executives said last month that the network stands to lose
$20 million on the miniseries even if it gets the ratings the
network guaranteed to sponsors. If it doesn't meet the guarantee,
the network will lose additional money by having to provide free
advertising to make up the difference. ABC won't say what the
guaranteed rating was.
   The network was hamstrung by author Wouk's contractual
limitations on the amount and type of advertising that ABC could run
during the miniseries. Wouk was concerned about inappropriate
juxtaposition of some type of commercials with the miniseries'
graphic concentration camps scenes.
   The unexpectedly low rating for ``War and Remembrance'' can be
ascribed in part to Nielsen's new measurement system that tends to
produce lower ratings generally, but probably owes more to a general
trend away from network viewing, a trend that was exacerbated when
the writers' strike delayed the networks' new shows and summer
reruns extended well into the fall.
   But network executives have been saying for the past few years
that the days of the lengthy, big-event miniseries are probably
over. Most miniseries in recent seasons have been no longer than
four parts and most have been only two. ``Amerika,'' the last long
miniseries at 14{ hours, also only ABC, failed in the ratings two
years ago.

   An 11-year-old boy who took a city bus on a
seven-block joy ride bailed out of the moving bus before it collided
head-on with an automobile, injuring the driver, officials said.
   The boy, who was charged with juvenile delinquency, was treated
for head and eye bruises. The name of the boy was withheld because
of his age.
   The youth climbed inside the 40-foot-bus at a maintenance yard in
the borough of Brooklyn on Monday morning, said Bob Slovak, a
spokesman for the Transit Authority.
   The boy pulled the bus into the street, where it smashed into the
side of a parked fire engine, crashed into the side of a parked
truck, collided head-on with a car and then careened into a pillar
beneath elevated subway tracks.
   ``If he hadn't jumped out, he would have been killed,'' said
police Sgt. John Gorman.
   The 30-year-old injured driver was hospitalized in stable
condition with a neck injury, officials said.
   The boy, dubbed little Ralph Kramden by police, lives in a group
home on Chauncey Street _ the same Brooklyn street where the bus
driver played by Jackie Gleason in television's ``Honeymooners''
lived, the New York Post reported today.

   The U.S. dollar this morning eased against many
foreign currencies in European trading as traders said they were
withdrawing from the market ahead of Wednesday's release of U.S.
trade figures for September. Gold prices rose.
   ``We expect the (trade) report to show a gap of $10 billion to
$11 billion,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank in
Frankfurt. The August U.S. trade deficit was 12.18 billion dollars.
   Meanwhile, Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh Pemberton said
foreign exchange markets were ``unjustified'' in expecting an
instant response or meeting from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential elections.
   Leigh Pemberton said in an interview broadcast on the
Zurich-based European Business Channel that he does not favor a
lower dollar. He said there has been no change in the G-7's policy
of stable exchange rates since the group last met in Berlin in
September.
   ``The policy statement that flowed from our most recent meeting
is still valid and in my opinion there has been no change from the
stance expressed in that statement,'' he said.
   ``There was no reason why the dollar should be talked down and it
would be better if it shouldn't go down.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.25 yen to close at 123.25. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 123.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.7457 West German marks, up from 1.7452
   _1.4620 Swiss francs, down from 1.4645
   _5.9605 French francs, down from 5.9615
   _1.9663 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9735
   _1,298.25 Italian lire, down from 1,303.50
   _1.2328 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2297
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8090, unchanged from late
Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $422.70 a troy ounce, up
from $420.95 bid late Monday. At midmorning Tuesday, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $422.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $422.90, up from $420.00 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.56 to close at a bid $424.07.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.42 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $6.39.

<TEXT>
   The arrival of Amtrak's Texas
Eagle, wheels clicking and whistle sounding, marked the return of
passenger service between Dallas and Houston after more than 30
years and put the ``station'' back in this city's name.
   The Texas Eagle stopped briefly for ceremonies in College
Station-Bryan and in Corsicana, along its 265-mile route Monday from
Dallas to Houston. Passenger service for the public begins today.
   About 500 people watched the train arrive at a temporary depot at
the stop some 80 miles northwest of Houston. The Joe Azcona Band
performed Mexican mariachi music in the lounge for the inaugural run.
   For the special trip, Amtrak included its ceremonial office car
on the train as its caboose. The office car contains its own
kitchen, a sleeping area and a work-conference room.
   The car was most recently used by presidential hopeful Michael
Dukakis when he campaigned in California's San Joaquin Valley, said
Jim Larson, Amtrak's assistant vice president for operations.
   ``The car was used by three presidents,'' Larson said. John
Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford all used the Amtrak car, he
said.
   Many who toured the sleek, silver Texas Eagle in its inaugural
run were reminded of earlier train-travel experiences.
   ``I think it's great,'' said J.E. Loupot, a bookstore owner who
remembered arriving in College Station in 1928 as a Texas A&M
University freshman.
   ``We've been looking forward to it for a long time,'' said
Loupot, one of more than 100 Bryan-College Station residents who
took the train's inaugural ride. ``They'll (A&M students) use it,
too.''

   With the international attention drawn to
the recent rescue of two trapped whales near Barrow, perhaps it was
inevitable that someone would put the saga to music.
   Paul Candide, a New York composer, recently sent Gov. Steve
Cowper a tape recording of his song, ``Gentle Creatures,'' with a
letter asking Cowper to share it with those who helped free the
California gray whales from the Arctic ice last month. A sampling of
the lyrics:
   ``Have you heard of the tale of the whales who got stuck
   and the people who helped set them free?
   They were swimming alone when they got down on their luck
   underneath the deep blue sea ...
   Eskimos brought saws to open the sea
   as they joined in to set them free
   And the Russians brought icebreakers through the sea
   as they joined in to save those three.''
   Candide told Cowper that the whales' story touched him so ``that
I had to put it into words and music.''

   A Springfield couple whose dog
disappeared last week were reunited with the hound after it was
pictured in news reports with Gov. James R. Thompson.
   ``The governor's very happy that the dog is back with its
owners,'' Thompson spokesman Jim Bray said Monday. ``Anybody who
owns a dog knows the heartsick feeling when the dog leaves the yard
for any extended period.''
   Thompson had decided Sunday to keep the black-and-tan coon hound
after troopers found it Friday tied to a gate of the Governor's
Mansion with a note that read: ``Please give pup a good home, we
can't. We will miss him dearly, please take care of him.''
   The governor, who already has two dogs, named his new-found pet
Trooper in honor of the state police guards who found him.
   Bray speculated that when the dog left its owners' home, it may
have come into the hands of someone else, who left it at the mansion
rather than taking it to an animal shelter.
   ``Maybe they thought there would be plenty of room at the
mansion,'' he said.
   The dog's owners asked not to be identified, Bray said, but there
was no doubt that it was their pet.
   One of the owners described the 4-year-old dog in detail,
including a scar on its right ear and a scar on its left hip. And
when she called the dog's real name, Maximilian, he came running and
jumped into her arms, Bray said.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl who survived by playing
dead after she was shot, beaten and left in a burning house is ``one
of the bravest, strongest little girls I know,'' says the county
sheriff.
   The girl, Brook Rottinghaus, finally sneaked from the burning
house, which contained the bodies of her mother and stepfather, and
was able to get help early Sunday, authorities said.
   Okanogan County Sheriff Jim Weed said the girl awoke about 2 a.m.
Sunday to the sound of gunfire. She called downstairs from the loft
where she slept and a man she later identified as Lawrence R.
Sullens told her the noise was a propane stove popping, Weed said.
   Weed said the child saw her mother double over from a wound to
the abdomen.
   The man then climbed the stairs leading to the loft, shot the
girl, kicked her in the face and went back downstairs and started
two fires, police said.
   Brook went downstairs and hid, but the man found her, pulled her
into the living room, and kicked her in the face again.
   ``When she landed that time, she played dead with fires going on
each side of her,'' Weed said.
   Brook apparently waited a few minutes to be sure the man would
not come back, then ran about a quarter mile through snow in the
rural area in north-central Washington for help.
   ``This little gal was just exceptionally brave and had
unbelievable presence of mind in dealing with this situation,'' Weed
said.
   The girl was listed in good condition today at North Valley
Hospital in Tonasket, said Okanogan County Undersheriff Mike Murray.
He said she was shot in the upper right arm, then the bullet grazed
her chest and struck her upper left arm.
   The girl's father joined her from California, authorities said.
   Sullens, 25, was arrested Sunday night at his apartment in
Everett. He remained in jail early today, but no charges had been
filed, authorities said.
   Killed were Charles Glanville, 45, and his wife, Betty, 40.
   Weed said police did not have a motive for the shootings, but
added that the suspect was being questioned and was cooperative.
   ``We feel really bad,'' Weed said. ``It's so bizarre and she lost
so much.'' He said police have visited the girl at the hospital, and
some have taken teddy bears.
   ``I spent an hour with her. She's pretty upset but I don't think
the shock has hit her yet,'' Weed said.
   Sheriff's deputies say Sullens, a martial arts expert, had
purchased a tae kwon do studio near Everett from the Glanvilles and
had been to their home once before.
   Tonasket is a town of 1,000 residents about 20 miles from the
Canadian border.

<HEAD>Michael Jackson Cancels Two Concerts Because Of Swollen Vocal
Chords</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of fans were left disappointed when
swollen vocal chords kept pop superstar Michael Jackson from taking
the stage for the second of a series of sold-out concerts, his
publicist said.
   Jackson, who was unable to perform as scheduled Monday night at
the Los Angeles Sports Arena, also canceled tonight's show, said
publicist Lee Solters.
   Both shows will be rescheduled, Solters said. An estimated 30,000
ticketholders were told to save their tickets or stubs for admission
to the new shows.
   Solters said the cancellation of the shows, announced about 40
minutes before Monday's performance was to begin, was made on the
advice of Jackson's physician.
   Jackson began a local six-concert engagement Sunday night as part
of a worldwide tour promoting his ``Bad'' album.

<HEAD>Police Chief: Abortion Activists Must Pay Costs Of Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 102 anti-abortion activists
arrested for trying to block the doors of a women's clinic may end
up paying the Police Department for costs incurred in handling the
protest, the police chief said.
   Police Chief Joe Gerwens said Monday he had asked City Prosecutor
Scott Walker to try to recover the estimated $3,800 the Nov. 4
protest cost the department.
   ``They chose civil disobedience to make a point and they should
be willing to pay the consequences,'' Gerwens said. ``They planned
on being arrested.''
   Demonstrators planted themselves before the entrance to the Sigma
Women's Center, which advertises abortions, waiting to carried to
paddy wagons and booked on trespassing charges.
   It took 26 Fort Lauderdale police officers, plus eight from
nearby Oakland Park and the Broward County Sheriff's Office, to
quell the disturbance, Gerwens said.
   In addition to the officers' time, police cars had to be diverted
from their assigned zones to handle the protest. Other costs
included transportation, two portable toilets, film for booking
prisoners, an emergency medical truck and an ambulance, he said.
   Bonnie Callahan, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organization
Rescue South Florida, which was among several groups at the protest,
called the plan to seek reimbursement unfair.
   Ms. Callahan, whose 13-year-old daughter was among those
arrested, said the demonstration ``was not for the purpose of
getting arrested or getting publicity. Our main reason was to save
babies and save women from being exploited.''
   All those arrested were charged with trespassing, and all but one
were immediately released and given notice to appear in court.
   Gerwens said that by seeking reimbursement, the city was not
taking a position on the protest, only that taxpayers should not
have to pay for a deliberate disturbance. He said the department
will further pursue the idea of making those convicted of a crime
pay the police costs involved.

<HEAD>Wintry Storm Sweeps Rockies, Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow and high winds struck the Rocky Mountains and northern
Plains, with more than a foot of snow falling at Jackson, Wyo., and
in the northern Utah mountains.
   The storm left snow in the mountains of Southern California on
Monday and battered the region with high winds and rain, downing
tree limbs and power lines.
   A rogue wave in seas churned up by the storm swept over a jetty
next to Morro Rock, 180 miles northwest of Los Angeles, killing two
fishermen, according to the Morro Bay Police Department. A third
fisherman managed to cling to the jetty but suffered a broken arm.
   In Salt Lake City, a 17-year-old girl died Monday when she lost
control of her car on a snow-slickened road and it slid into the
path of a school bus.
   In Wyoming, strong winds accompanying the snow created
near-blizzard conditions in some areas. Winds up to 61 mph were
reported in Laramie, with winds up to 55 mph in Casper.
   Ski operators in western Wyoming were happy at the possibility of
early openings. ``We love it,'' said Jim Sullivan, mountain manager
at the Snow King ski area in Jackson.
   With the storm moving across the Plains, heavy snow and high
winds were developing from eastern Colorado and eastern Wyoming to
the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of the Dakotas. Winter storm
warnings were posted for portions of northern Arizona, southern
Utah, the Colorado mountains, southeastern Wyoming, northwestern
South Dakota, eastern North Dakota and the northwest corner of
Minnesota.
   Snow advisories were in effect over western North Dakota,
northeastern Montana, much of Wyoming and northwestern New Mexico,
and winter storm watches for heavy snow were issued for northeastern
Colorado, northwestern Nebraska, portions of South Dakota,
southeastern North Dakota and much of northwest Minnesota.
   Unseasonably mild air to the southeast of the storm raised
temperatures to the mid 60s this morning as far north as Kansas
City, Mo.
   Rain fell over portions of the Pacific Northwest, especially in
western Oregon, while densefog developed again this morning across
parts of the Southeast.
   Clear skies prevailed from southern New England across the
central and southern Appalachians and the Ohio and middle
Mississippi valleys.
   A number of cities reported record-high temperatures for the date
Monday, including Albuquerque, N.M., where 72 broke the 1967 record
of 70; Dodge City, Kan., where 82 was 4 degrees higher than the 1897
record; and Houston, where it reached 87, breaking the 1978 mark of
86.
   The high in the nation Monday was 92 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the central and southern
Rockies to the northern Plains; showers and thunderstorms from the
central and southern Plains to the middle and upper Mississippi
Valley, and rain in the Pacific Northwest. Stiff winds were expected
from the Rockies across the Plains to the Mississippi Valley,
causing blowing and drifting snow from eastern Colorado to the
northern Plains.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 20s and 30s from the
northern and central Rockies across western Nebraska and the
northern Plains to northern Minnesota; in the 40s and 50s from New
England across the Great Lakes to the upper Mississippi Valley and
central Plains, and in the southern Rockies to the Pacific
Northwest; in the unseasonably warm 70s in eastern Kansas, Missouri
and the lower Ohio Valley; and in the 80s from Florida across the
Gulf Coast to much of Texas. Elsewhere, highs were forecast for the
60s and 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Helena, Mont., to 78 degrees at Corpus Christi (Texas)
Naval Air Station.

   Today's developments concerning the Palestinian declaration of
independence:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALGIERS, Algeria _ The PLO's parliament-in-exile proclaims an
independent Palestinian state, approving a new, moderate political
program that indirectly recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism.
The move, a victory for moderates in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, is largely symbolic but could add impetus to
Palestinian efforts to achieve self-rule.
   Israel's leaders oppose a Palestinian state, and authorities said
they would quash unilateral Palestinian steps toward self-rule.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank _ The army seals off the West Bank
and Gaza Strip to squelch celebrations of the Algiers declaration,
but Arab youths defiantly take to the streets. Gaza is under curfew
for a fourth straight day and a curfew is imposed in Bethlehem for
the first time since 1967.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Reagan administration reacts cautiously to the
PLO move. President Reagan says before the declaration in Algiers
that the Palestinians' implicit recognition of Israel's right to
exist ``would be some progress'' toward achieving lasting peace in
the Middle East.
   The United States has long insisted that the PLO accept Israel's
right to exist and denounce terrorism if it wants to be recognized
by Washington.

<HEAD>Teacher Will Not Be Disciplined For Prison Simulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school teacher will not be
disciplined for arranging a field trip in which students were
strip-searched, hog-tied and forced to eat fish-head soup in a
simulation of Third World prison conditions, officials said.
   ``Some of the learning activities that were conducted went beyond
what was really necessary to accommodate the objectives of the
program,'' said Denie Young, spokeswoman for the Wheaton-Warrenville
school district, at a school board meeting Monday.
   Superintendent Richard Short ``supports the program, the prison
simulation,'' she said. ``The administration just feels that parts
of it were carried to an extreme.''
   Last month's voluntary field trip to Wheaton College by 34
juniors and seniors from Wheaton North High School was intended to
give students a taste of criminal-justice systems, included one that
might exist in a Third World country ruled by a despot.
   The field trip included strip-searches, a meal of potato soup
with a fish head floating in it, blindfolds, handcuffs and nude
``duck-walking'' involving some of the boys, Ms. Young said.
   The students who participated had no complaints, but afterward,
some parents said they were outraged by the field trip, and the
school board asked Short to evaluate the program.
   Short told about 50 parents that there would be no disciplinary
action against Wheaton North teacher David Oliphant, a popular
American government instructor who arranged the field trip.
   But Short said the consent form parents were asked to sign was
inadequate.
   ``We would want to see to it that the communication with parents
would be a lot more effective'' in the future, he said. ``There was
a need for parents to have a greater understanding of what they were
signing.''
   The field trip was supervised by Don Smarto, director of the
college's Institute for Prison Ministries, who acted as the
``warden.'' Two college students were ``guards.''

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle Has Picture-Perfect Maiden Flight</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to move up reference to U.S. program, ADD
Gorbachev comments. Picks up 10th pvs, `Buran separated ...'
^By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet space shuttle Buran orbited the Earth
twice today and landed eight miles from its launch pad in Soviet
Central Asia, ending with flawless precision its unmanned 3-hour,
25-minute maiden flight.
   The successful flight puts the Soviets into the shuttle program
alongside the United States. A major success for the Soviet space
program, it comes after a series of problems including the near loss
of cosmonauts on a joint Soviet-Afghan mission to the Mir space
station in September.
   The Buran, snowstorm in Russian, touched down on a 2.8-mile
concrete runway with a puff of dust from its rear wheels and rolled
to a halt as three parachutes opened at its rear.
   ``The U.S.S.R. has successfully tested its first reusable space
craft Buran,'' official Radio Moscow said, interrupting regular
programming two minutes after touchdown.
   The flight originally was scheduled for Oct. 29, but computers
stopped that countdown with only 51 seconds left when an access arm
failed to pull far enough away from the rocket. Officials said they
had since redesigned the joint.
   Within 30 minutes of today's landing, Soviet television showed
the fully automated approach and touchdown of the delta-winged U.S.
shuttle look-alike in the middle of the barren, brown steppe.
   Radio Moscow said the flight, which had been in jeopardy because
of cold, rainy weather, went according to schedule, and all on-board
tests were completed.
   Pointing to the January 1986 explosion of the U.S. shuttle
Challenger that killed its seven crewmembers, Soviet officials say
they will not make a manned flight until all the shuttle's systems
are fully tested in unmanned flight.
   They have not said when that might be.
   Tass said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, informed of the
flight's success, said the flight was ``one more confirmation of the
kind of huge possibilities the Soviet Union has to solve any
problem.''
   Buran separated as planned from the liquid fuel Energia booster
minutes after it lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in a flame
of yellow, with clouds of white steam lighting up the early morning
sky.
   About three-quarters of an hour later, Buran's own engines fired
twice at an altitude of 99 miles, nudging the craft into its two
orbits.
   Television film shot from a jet aircraft showed the shuttle's
dark silhouette against a pale blue-gray sky as it approached the
landing site, then switched to closer shots as the shuttle landed
like an aircraft.
   The official Tass news agency said as it prepared to re-enter the
atmosphere, the shuttle turned its tail forward, and switched on a
retrofire engine. At an altitude of 24 miles, the craft turned again
and began its approach like an airplane.
   The weather service in Moscow reported that it had been raining
in Baikonur three hours before the launch, and the temperature was
39 degrees. The weather at the exact launch time was not known.
   Soviet television said the launch was in jeopardy because of
rising wind and the danger of ice coating the shuttle and its
booster.
   U.S. officials will not launch the American space shuttle if
there is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter and cold temperatures
contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the
Challenger disaster, which halted the U.S. space shuttle program for
2{ years.
   The last U.S. shuttle mission began Sept. 29, and NASA plans to
announce its next launch date on Wednesday.
   Soviet space officals have said their ability to control the
shuttle entirely from the ground makes it safer than the U.S. space
shuttle program. And after the Soviet shuttle program begins in
earnest, fully automated ground control will allow cosmonauts more
time for scientific research, they say.
   The United States flew its first shuttle, the Columbia, in 1981,
and for years the Soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and
unreliable. But Western space specialists say the Soviets began
planning and building their space plane in 1982 at the latest.
   Tass said Buran is 36 yards long and has a wing span of 24 yards.
Like the U.S. shuttle, it is covered with 38,000 heat-proof ceramic
tiles to protect it from the searing heat of reentry.
   Soviet officials say their shuttle has a bigger payload capacity
than the U.S. shuttle, and that several more are under construction.
It can hold up to 10 cosmonauts and mission specialists.
   But the Soviet officials say only two to four flights are planned
yearly, and that the Soviet space program still will depend on
single-use spacecraft for the bulk of its work in the cosmos,
including putting satellites into orbit.

<HEAD>Shamir Invites Peres To Coalition Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, entrusted with
forming Israel's next government, said today that he will try to
coax the left-leaning Labor Party into his rightist-religious
coalition.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres accepted Shamir's invitation to attend
coalition talks today, but expressed doubts his party would join a
Shamir-led government. Labor and Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc are
sharply divided on how to end the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Shamir issued his invitation to Peres after being told by
President Chaim Herzog that the president's office had been flooded
with thousands of calls urging a Labor-Likud government.
   ``I said many times that I prefer a broad-based government
including the two large parties,'' Shamir said on Israel television.
``I'm looking for a way to bring this about.''
   A unity government would blunt the power of Shamir's other
coalition partners _ four religious parties that seek to impose
changes on Israel's secular majority and three extreme right-wing
parties that demand annexation of the occupied lands.
   ``The public is worried. There is a wish for unity to confront
the dangers from outside and the separation threatening us from
within,'' Herzog told Shamir on Monday after asking him to form the
next government.
   Shamir has six weeks to form a ruling coalition, and is expected
to get the needed 61-seat majority in the 120-member Parliament.
   In the Nov. 1 elections, Likud won 40 seats, Labor 39 and the
religious parties 18, putting the smaller parties in the position of
kingmaker.
   In issuing his invitation to Labor, Shamir ruled out an equal
partnership such as the uneasy one formed between Labor and Likud
after the inconclusive elections of 1984. Shamir also hinted Labor
could help formulate a peace strategy if it joined the government.
   But Peres appeared skeptical. ``I don't think there are many
chances for it (a national unity government),'' Peres said on Israel
radio without elaborating.
   Labor's secretary general, Uzi Baram, said his party would not
accept a junior position and demanded parity in the distribution of
Cabinet posts, including senior jobs for Peres and Labor's No. 2,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   But Israel radio quoted Rabin as saying Labor should join the new
government even as a junior partner to prevent a narrow
rightist-religious coalition.

   The Israeli Foreign Ministry today rejected a
PLO declaration of independence for Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as ``double talk.''
   Similarly, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected the PLO
announcement of a Palestinian state as another step in the ``war by
Arab terror organizations'' to destroy the Jewish state.
   Despite moderate language implictly recognizing Israel, the PLO
document approved Monday in Algeria was also rejected by Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   ``There is no chance ... that any declaration of theirs will be
accepted before negotiations,'' said Peres. ``Our problem now is not
solving the Palestinian issue but how to open negotiations because
without negotiations there will be no solution to the problem.''
   Hours after the declaration was announced, Israel's official
response came in a Foreign Ministry statement that criticized the
Algiers declaration as ``double talk'' employed to excuse PLO
support for violence and terror.
   ``No gimmick can mask the tragedy inflicted upon the Palestinian
people time and again by the absence of reasonable, realistic and
peace-seeking leadership,'' said the statement, which called on
other nations not to recognize the PLO state.
   Shamir, addressing his remarks to Palestinians in the occupied
territories, predicted there would be ``political war'' with the
Palestinians over international recognition of the PLO state.
   Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait and Malaysia have already
recognized the Palestinian state declared in Algiers.
   ``This is not the way to a life of peace, security and
coexistence with the Jewish people in the land of Israel,'' Shamir
said. ``This is another step in the war of Arab terror organizations
against Israel's existence and independence and we shall respond
accordingly.''
   Both Peres and Shamir spoke at the Negev Desert communal farm of
Sde Boker, where Israeli leaders gathered to pay tribute to Israel's
first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, on the 15th anniversary of
his death.
   Left-wing Israelis welcomed the more moderate language of the PLO
and the declaration's recognition of the Jewish state.
   But hard-line politicians called for annexation or a massive
drive to settle Jews in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip where
1.5 million Arabs and 70,000 Israels live.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading member of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, called the declaration a ``dangerous
development'' and said Israel should assert its claim by annexing
part of the occupied land in response.
   He said the security situation in the occupied lands could
further deterioriate. At least 312 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have
been killed in the 11-month uprising.
   In an interview with the daily Yediot Ahronot, Shamir called for
negotiations under the U.S.-Soviet sponsorship as an alternative to
a U.N.-sponsored international conference favored by the Arabs.
   Negotiations would take place with Egyptian, Jordanian and
Palestinian delegations but not the PLO, Yediot Ahronot reported.
   Israel's major dailies headlined the PLO's new political program
announced in Algiers, focusing on its acceptance of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 242 that implicitly recognizes Israel.

<TEXT>
   The leader of southern Sudan's rebels has
agreed to a cease-fire in his 5{-year rebellion and to allow relief
to reach starving war refugees, the official Sudan News Agency
reported today.
   In return, the agency said, renegade army Col. John Garang
expects a national state of emergency to be lifted and a
constitutional conference convened.
   The agreement was reported in dispatches from the Ethiopian
capital of Addis Ababa, where it was to be signed today, and from
Nairobi, Kenya. It does not commit the government, but Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi gave the talks his blessing and said he would
follow up on any agreements reached.
   Garang negotiated the agreement with Mohammed Osman Mirghani,
patriarch of the Democratic Unionist Party, the second partner in
Mahdi's governing coalition.
   Garang organized the Sudan People's Liberation Army in early 1983
and began his fight for southern autonomy and political, economic
and administrative reforms. Then-President Gaafar Nimeiri's
proclamation of Islamic law exacerbated the war six months later,
and Garang has vowed not to lay down arms until Sudan's civilian
government abrogates Sharia.
   Traditionally, the country's Moslem majority dominates the
central government. Most of the southerners are Christian or animist.
   Relief workers say the accumulated effects of more than five
years of war have brought widespread famine to much of the south
this year. They estimate that 1.3 million of the region's 6 million
inhabitants have fled this year alone, with starvation killing more
than 250,000 people.
   There was no immediate reaction to the agreement from the
government. Foreign Minister Hussein Suleiman Abu-Saleh attended the
talks as a member of the Democratic Unionist leadership.
   Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Hamid Khaleel has said the military
would welcome any peace agreement.
   ``We are the people most concerned about peace, because we suffer
more than the others from war,'' Khaleel said. ``We are with the
strategy of peace (but) will continue defending the territorial
integrity of Sudan.''
   The Addis Ababa talks have drawn fire from another coalition
partner, the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, which saw them
as a ploy to force the Moslem party from the government. Any
agreement between Mirghani and Garang would make future talks
involving the government ineffective, the front's political affairs
secretary, Ali Haj, said.
   The Sudan News Agency gave few details on the agreement. The
agency said Mirghani described his discussions with Garang as
``serious and frank.''

and drug use.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics said Monday that it rejects
censorship, but called on producers and programmers to demonstrate
``good taste'' in their choice of the images shown in videos on
television.
   ``Music videos may represent a new art form, but we believe it is
one that contains an excess of sexism, violence, substance abuse,
suicides and sexual behavior,'' the academy said in a statement.
   Dr. Victor Strasburger, an author of the statement, said the
academy is not against rock music, but listening to rock is one
thing, and watching images on television is another.
   ``Teen-agers who may not hear or understand rock lyrics cannot
avoid the often disturbing images that characterize a growing number
of videos,'' the academy said.
   The 34,000-member academy is based in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   MTV spokesman Barry Kluger defended his music video cable
channel, saying all videos are screened for their depictions of
women, children and drug and alcohol abuse before being allowed on
the channel.
   Kluger said he agreed with the academy that parents should more
actively control what is watched by their children.
   ``We're not urging parents to use MTV as a baby sitter,'' he said.
   Strasburger said the doctors are concerned about the number of
women who are sexually abused, adding that ``we can't show small
children images where women are being raped or chained or beat up.''
   And that is what happens in rock videos, he said. With one study
finding that 75 percent of the music videos telling a story contain
sexually suggestive material, and 56 percent of them containing
violence, often against women.
   Strasburger said parents should watch music videos with their
children to influence the children's reaction to the images.
   The academy has also criticized soap operas, prime-time situation
comedies, children's programming and commercials for displaying
``unhealthy images,'' Strasburger said.

   American females born today can expect to live
healthier, longer lives than those born a quarter century ago, but
the AIDS epidemic and limited access to the health care system pose
a serious threat, says a status report on today's woman.
   Citing recent surveys and national statistics, the study suggests
that although women make up a small proportion of those who have
been diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the
beginning of the deadly epidemic, women are the fastest growing
group of people with AIDS.
   A separate study on women's health care notes that of the 37
million Americans without health insurance, women are most
vulnerable.
   The poverty rate is higher among women, especially older women,
and they must rely on inadequate public programs, the study said.
Women classified as non-poor are less likely to work than men and
therefore are less likely to be covered by an employer's health
insurance plan.
   The studies are contained in ``The American Woman 1988-89: A
Status Report,'' a 443-page collection addressing issues ranging
from the presence of women in politics to basic health care to
women's progress in law enforcement.
   The report was prepared by the Women's Research & Education
Institution and was being released today. The women's organization
considers the report a challenge to the new administration of
President-elect George Bush.
   In a chapter devoted to AIDS, the study cites statistics compiled
by the Centers for Disease Control, which found that in the first 11
months of 1987, 1,377 women were diagnosed with the incurable
disease _ 8 percent of all AIDS cases reported during that period.
   The disease that attacks the body's immune system is believed
caused by an unusual virus, now called human immunodeficiency virus
or HIV. The virus is spread through close contact with blood or
semen from infected persons. The disease is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
or infected blood or blood products.
   The study notes that the Centers for Disease Control estimates
there are 50 to 80 times as many women who are infected with HIV as
there are women with active cases of AIDS.
   The status report says that 15 percent of women who acquired AIDS
through sexual contact were not aware of their contact's risk factor
_ intravenous drug user, bisexual or the recipient of possibly
contaminated blood.
   ``To prevent further spread of the deadly AIDS virus to women and
their children, it is imperative both to educate the general public
and to mount aggressive, targeted outreach efforts to women at
highest risk,'' the report said.
   The chapter ``Women and Health Care'' said girls born in 1975 can
expect to live an average of seven years longer than boys born the
same year, but death rates for women from lung cancer have
quadrupled and women suffer more than men from infections and
respiratory diseases.
   Life expectancy for women has increased rapidly, however. The
life expectancy for females born in 1960 was 73.1 years; for those
born in 1985, it was 78.2 years, the report said.
   The government's National Center for Health Statistics reported
in August that life expectancy for women was 78.3 years as of 1987,
the same as the high set the year before.
   But the most serious problem is access to health care.
   ``A country as prosperous and ingenious as this one is should not
tolerate the great disparities that exist between men and women,
between the poor and the non-poor, and between whites and minorities
in something so vital and basic as health care,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Police Order Two Americans To Stay After Illegal Trip To Laos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today ordered two Americans
who had illegally crossed into Laos on a search for U.S. prisoners
of war to remain in Thailand pending an investigation of their
status.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, returned to
Bangkok on Saturday after 41 days of detention in a Laotian jail.
The Laotian authorities detained them after they sailed across the
Mekong River from Thailand to illegally enter Laos.
   Once in Laos, they passed out offers of a $2.4 million reward for
Americans they believe are still being held more than 13 years after
the Indochina war ended.
   When they returned to Bangkok, immigration officials at the
airport let them through but kept their passports because they did
not bear the stamp given when travelers leave Thailand, said Capt.
Apisak Phumsvi of Immigration Police.
   That delayed the Americans' original plans to leave for the
United States Wednesday.
   Apisak said immigration commander Maj. Gen. Kriangkrai Karnasuta
must approve the Americans' request that the charges of an
immigration violation be waived. The process normally takes up to
three days, he said.
   ``Their case is not a serious violation of Thai immigration
rules,'' Apisak said. ``We are looking at it as if it were
unintentional.''
   Miss Long is a 45-year-old writer from Jacksonville, N.C., and
Copp is a 44-year-old schoolteacher from Hampstead, N.C. They said
they were not physically mistreated in Laos, but were subjected to
interrogations and spent 32 days in solitary confinement.
   They were released after $1,500 in administrative costs was paid
to the Laotian government and a veterans group canceled a protest
planned at the Laotian Embassy in Washington to demand their release.
   Miss Long said a police colonel told her that if any other
Americans dared enter Laos illegally again, they would be held
``forever, forever.''
   The reward the two Americans were trying to publicize was pledged
by 21 U.S. Congressmen and some private citizens.
   Laos has repeatedly denied it is holding any Americans from the
war.
   The State Department on Monday praised the release of Miss Long
and Copp. But its spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said: ``We reiterate
our conviction that government-to-government cooperation is the way
to resolve the the POW-MIA (prisoner of war - missing in action)
issue ... and that reward offers are counterproductive to this
ongoing effort.
   There are 547 Americans listed as MIA in Laos.

<HEAD>Students At University Campus Warned Of Computer Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warnings about a rapidly spreading computer
virus have been issued to students at California State University,
Northridge, following reports the virus is disrupting functions of
Macintosh computers.
   ``In general, this thing is spreading like mad,'' Chris Sales,
the university's computer center consultant, said Monday. ``It
originated in West Germany, found its way to UCLA and in a short
time infected us here.''
   School officials say at least a dozen of the Macintosh computers
at the suburban San Fernando Valley campus have been affected by a
virus that was discovered last week.
   A computer virus is akin to a living virus, and can spread from
terminal to terminal and even computer system to computer system by
``infected'' discs. It can disrupt such functions as word processing
and printing.
   Some viruses can even destroy valuable files, but Cal State
officials said the bug found there does not erase data. It does
stall computers, though, and removal requires hours of
reprogramming, officials said.
   Students' computer discs are being tested for the virus before
they are able to rent a Macintosh at the university bookstore.
   Earlier this month, another virus duplicated itself in university
and government research computers nationwide, slowing the computers'
processing speeds and filled up their memories. A graduate student
is under investigation in that case.

<TEXT>
   The army sealed off the
occupied lands today to block celebrations of Palestinian
independence, but Arab youths defiantly took to the streets,
shooting off firecrackers and singing a nationalist anthem.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called a general
strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip today to mark what the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, meeting in Algeria, proclaimed as independence
day.
   In Bethlehem, under curfew for the first time since 1967, dozens
of teen-agers ignored threats of fines and jail terms to run through
streets lighting fireworks and singing the nationalist song, ``My
Homeland, My Homeland.''
   Army jeeps blocked town entrances and soldiers ordered residents
to stay indoors. ``Everybody who goes out will endanger his life,''
one soldier announced over a loudspeaker.
   At Dheishe refugee camp, several cars belonging to Jewish
settlers were stoned, their windows smashed. Smoke from burning
tires rose from the camp, and Israeli soldiers could be heard firing
rubber bullets for riot control.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, an 18-year-old Palestinian
was shot by soldiers but the circumstances were not clear, hospital
officials said.
   In Israel, a 30-year-old Palestinian prisoner from Gaza was found
strangled to death in his cell in the Ashkelon Jail, and police
suspect he was slain by an Arab cellmate for allegedly collaborating
with the Israeli authorities.
   The army extended a curfew over the Gaza Strip's 650,000
residents for a fourth day and sealed the West Bank. The orders
blocked residents of the territories from entering Israel and
reporters from going to either occupied area without an army escort.
   Police forces were deployed within Israel, where leaders of the
720,000 Israeli Arabs ordered a general strike to protest recent
house demolitions.
   In Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, an additional 1,000
police officers were deployed to prevent pro-PLO demonstrations, and
authorities banned gatherings of more than 10 people.
   In Israel's first official response to the declaration of
independence, a Foreign Ministry statement called it ``double
talk.'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir predicted ``political war''
with the Palestinians over the declaration.
   Shamir was quoted by the daily Yediot Ahronot as saying he would
propose a new peace plan to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Shamir, who opposes a U.N.-sponsored international conference
endorsed by the Arabs, wants peace negotiations with Palestinians
and Arab states to be under the auspices of the United States and
Soviet Union.
   Zeev Hever, a settlers' leader from Hebron, said the Algiers
declaration has ``totally no meaning. Israel rules over the
territory and decides what happens.''
   Sheik Mohammad Abu Teir, a Moslem religious leader, criticized
the declaration's implicit recognition of Israel and repeated the
fundamentalist stand that all of Palestine should be an Islamic
state.
   ``We have been offering sacrifices for many years and now they
recognize the state of the Jews. Where is the land of this state?''
he said by telephone from Umm Touba village, near Bethlehem.
   The fireworks, graffiti splashed on walls and raising of outlawed
Palestine flags came despite an army announcement that Palestinians
could face prison sentences of five years and fines of $10,000 for
such actions.
   In Bethlehem, a map picturing Palestine before the Jewish state's
creation was painted on one wall, with this slogan:
``Congratulations, Palestine.'' The map contradicted the
independence declaration, which was based on a 1947 U.N. plan
calling for creation of Jewish and Arab states side-by-side in
Palestine.
   The Algiers declaration was expected to fuel the revolt against
Israel's 21-year rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The 11-month
uprising has cost the lives of at least 312 Palestinians and 11
Israelis.
   But the declaration will have little immediate impact on life in
the occupied lands. Israeli leaders oppose a Palestinian state, and
authorities said they would quash unilateral Palestinian steps
toward self-rule.
   Palestinian leaders expressed hope the declaration would get the
stalled peace process moving by implicitly recognizing Israel.
   ``This is the beginning of a new era for the Palestinians,'' said
lawyer Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent PLO supporter in the Gaza Strip.
``It shows the Palestinians are ready to co-exist with Israel, that
they want a state side-by-side with Israel.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Postpones Extradition Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The supreme court today postponed its
decision on the extradition of a Palestinian wanted by the United
States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
   Panayiotis Theodoropoulos, president of the five-member panel,
said the decision to extradite Mohammed Rashid would be issued after
the United States supplies key documents needed to make a ruling.
   The 39-year-old Palestinian is charged with planting a bomb
aboard a Pan Am Jumbo jet flying from Tokyo to Hawaii. A Japanese
teen-ager was killed and 15 other people were injured in the blast.
   Rashid may also be linked to the bloody July 11 attack aboard the
City of Poros cruise ship off Athens that killed nine people and
injured 98. Police theorize the attack may have been a failed
attempt to take the ship hostage and force Rashid's release.
   On Oct. 10, a lower court approved the extradition of Rashid, but
the decision must be approved by the Areos Pagos, the supreme court.
   Before today's decision was announced, hundreds of police
officers and sharpshooters with automatic weapons guarded the court
building near the city center.
   Rashid's defense lawyers contested the postponement, arguing that
lower courts had requested the same documents in the past and failed
to get them.
   ``The documents have been requested ... twice in the past. What
makes you think they'll send them now?'' defense lawyer Spyros
Fitrakis asked the court.
   The high court asked the United States to supply an official copy
of a Japanese visa application allegedly filled in by Rashid in
Baghdad, Iraq, in July 1982.
   It also asked for official transcripts of testimony given by an
FBI agent that was used to draw up the extradition request.
   ``These are the documents we need. It they can't send them, they
have to explain why,'' Theodoropoulos said.
   According to the extradition request, Rashid received a visa in
Baghdad to visit Japan.
   ``It is obvious that the judges are not convinced by the American
evidence. If they had the documents they would have sent them
already,'' Rashid told the court.
   Rashid was arrested at Athens airport on May 29 on a tip from the
U.S. Embassy in Athens.
   U.S. officials have said they view Rashid's extradition as a test
of Greece's determination to combat international terrorism.
   American officials have said Rashid was also involved in the 1986
bombing of a TWA jetliner over southern Greece that killed four
Americans. The blast is not mentioned in the extradition request.

   A Brooklyn synagogue that lost holy Torah scrolls
in an arson fire received two replacement scrolls from an unlikely
source: a police department warehouse.
   Police said the Torahs had gone unclaimed and unused for years
after being recovered from thieves.
   ``Today is a very special day,'' Rabbi Hillel David said in
accepting the Torahs on Monday.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, whose mother was an orphan
adopted by a Jewish family in Brooklyn, said the ceremony held a
special significance for him.
   ``Today I repay a little bit of a major debt that I always felt I
owed the Jewish community,'' Ward said.
   David's Orthodox Congregation Rabbinical Institute Shari Torah
was heavily damaged and five Torah scrolls were destroyed in a fire
set on the Sabbath between the holiest days on the Jewish calendar _
Rosh Hashana, the New Year, and Yom Kippur, the day of repentance.
   Two boys, ages 12 and 15, from the neighborhood where the
synagogue is located, were charged with arson for the Sept. 7 blaze.
   Police say the two boys broke into the Orthodox synagogue in the
racially mixed neighborhood, spray-painted swastikas on the walls,
set a fire and unrolled and burned the Torahs.
   Ward, who made the presentation with Mayor Edward Koch, said the
two Torahs _ Judaism's most holy objects _ originally belonged to a
police officer who died years ago. The unidentified officer received
the Torahs when a synagogue he attended in Brooklyn was disbanded;
when he died, they were passed on to his family.
   In 1983, burglars took the Torahs from the family home but they
were recovered by the police, said Deputy Inspector John Higgins,
who is in charge of the property room.
   The family members, who asked to remain anonymous, made no effort
to reclaim the Torahs. Ward said that when he contacted them
recently, they agreed to donate the scrolls to David's congregation
of about 300.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Radioactive Material Downstream From Savannah
Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have discovered small
quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from
Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River
Plant.
   Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken
from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the
Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found
tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health
hazard, The Charleston News & Courier reported today.
   The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine
Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia.
The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants
because of water quality problems believed to be caused by
industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said.
   Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of nuclear fission, and is
generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma
radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects,
depending on the dosage.
   Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy's
environmental division at the nuclear plant, said he had not been
informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the
material probably originated at the Savannah nuclear plant.
   The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. The government-owned
plant has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed
that a series of accidents at the site over the past 30 years went
unreported to the public.
   Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study
showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream
found similar traces both in the water and river sediment.
   Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but
some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell
said. The level of contamination is far below EPA's maximum
allowable level for drinking water, he said.
   Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump water from the
Savannah River for drinking water.
   Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below
the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a
half-life of 30 years, persists in the environment longer than
tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it
takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate.
   The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah.

<TEXT>
   The army opened fire on thousands of
people protesting the massacre of Sinhalese bus passengers by
suspected Tamil rebels, killing five and injuring 17, police said
today.
   Soldiers began shooting at 3,000 Sinhalese who were demonstrating
today in Matala, 65 miles northeast of Colombo, after tear gas
failed to disperse the crowd, a senior police official said.
   Two people were killed and 11 wounded, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Monday, soldiers and police killed three other people and
injured six when they broke up demonstrations in the central towns
of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruawa, Horawapatana and Kekirawa, police
said.
   They said the demonstrations were to protest the government's
failure to prevent a massacre of 27 Sinhalese bus passengers by
Tamil rebels.
   The rebels ambushed a bus on Monday near the village of
Pinkatiya, about 140 miles northeast of Colombo, and killed 27
Sinhalese passengers, according to police and military sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police blamed the largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, denied they were responsible.
   In a statement issued by their London office and telexed to news
agencies and newspapers, the Tigers said: ``This is malicious
propaganda carried out by the Sri Lankan government to tarnish the
image of our organization.''
   The police and military sources said the killings were part of a
continued Tamil effort to drive away the Sinhalese from the
northeast, where the Tigers have been waging a five-year war for an
independent homeland.
   Tamils, who form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who
form 75 percent of the population and control the military and the
government.
   The government's peace overtures to the Tamils have sparked a
backlash among radical Sinhalese, who claim too many concessions
have been offered to the minority community.
   The government has set up local administrative councils to grant
limited autonomy to the Tamils, but the Tigers rejected the plan in
1987 because they said it did not meet their expectations.
   The Tigers have vowed to disrupt a provincial council election
scheduled for Saturday in the northeast.
   Last week, Sinhalese radicals called a four-day strike to demand
the resignation of President Junius R. Jayewardene. The government
ordered soldiers to open fire at anti-government demonstrators and
decreed the death sentence for people convicted of starting strikes.

   A warning by Soviet human rights activist
Andrei D. Sakharov that the West has more to fear from the failure
of Kremlin reforms than from their successes goes to the heart of a
dilemma facing George Bush as he prepares to lead American policy.
   ``The threat of perestroika doesn't consist of its success but of
its bloody failure. This would be a total calamity,'' said Sakharov,
conjuring up an image of a newly militant Kremlin again embracing
the totalitarianism and expansionism of the Stalin era.
   With Sakharov's words still ringing, Bush must ask himself how to
deal with Gditions to cooperative ventures. If we
don't, we may one day find ourselves the odd man out, economically
and militarily,'' wrote Hough, an outspoken Gorbachev enthusiast.
   Other analysts believe Gorbachev is already in domestic political
trouble, that there is little the United States can do to help or
harm him, and that he is interested in good relations with America
as well as with the rest of the West.
   ``The biggest problem that the United States faces now is being
blamed by our allies if Gorbachev fails,'' said John Van Oudenaren,
a RAND Corp. expert on Soviet relations with the West.
   While it is true that Gromyko is out and Dobrynin is down, they
are no less hostile to the United States than the sometimes
acid-tongued Yakovlev and Falin.
   Moreover, ``the actual impact that we can have on the Soviet
Union is limited,'' said Van Oudenaren. ``The biggest challenge is
to avoid being blamed for a failure of Gorbachev.'' Such blame can
be avoided by being responsive to his initiatives and having a very
active diplomacy toward him.''
   ``The chances are that Gorbachev will fail in some way, or enjoy
at most a partial success. The wildest expectations that people in
the West have for him are not likely to come to pass,'' said Van
Oudenaren, echoing a view that is widely held by U.S. government and
academic experts on the Soviet Union.
   ``The Reagan administration had a hyperactive policy toward
Gorbachev,'' said Van Oudenaren. And that policy bore fruit in the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed last December, and
in talks toward a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   Those negotiations helped convince the presidential electorate
that a vote for Bush was a vote for peace. Bush may have to keep the
same pace if he wishes to make the same argument in 1992.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mistrial in Aeromexico Liability Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new trial must be held in the Aeromexico
jetliner disaster because the first jury was tainted by speculation
that the pilot of a small plane may have died before slamming into
the jetliner, a judge ruled.
   A pool of prospective jurors was ordered to begin the selection
process again today in the trial to determine the blame for the
August 1986 accident that killed 82 people.
   ``I see some prejudice, some very genuine prejudice, to certain
parties,'' said U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who declared a
mistrial Monday in the civil suit.
   The new panel cannot hear any allegations that pilot William
Kramer was dead or incapacitated before the accident, ruled Kenyon.
   ``It's nothing more than a guess,'' he said at one point.
   Kramer's private plane entered restricted airspace and hit an
Aeromexico airliner over Cerritos on Aug. 31, 1986. The pilot was
killed along with his wife and daughter, as well as 64 people on the
jet and 15 on the ground.
   In opening statements last week, Kramer lawyers said the pilot
may have died of heart failure two minutes before his plane collided
with the jet.
   That suggestion tainted the jury, alleged Justice Department
lawyer Steven J. Riegel, who sought a mistrial. Riegel is defending
the government in more than 70 lawsuits.
   Although Kenyon denied the mistrial motion last Thursday, he did
rule the Kramer family lawyers couldn't raise the death or
incapacitation issue because it was purely speculative and the
evidence couldn't support the scenario.
   Riegel raised the mistrial motion again Monday. Kenyon granted
the motion after several hours of argument.
   The judge noted that the trial had just begun and no evidence had
been presented.
   ``It seems to me much cleaner'' this way, Kenyon said, adding he
didn't want to take objecting parties ``kicking and screaming'' into
the rest of the trial, which is expected to last at least through
January.
   The trial will decide how to apportion liability in the crash so
attorneys representing more than 75 plaintiffs can proceed with
lawsuits.

   The editor of the Christian Science Monitor has
resigned, saying her decision was in part a protest of a plan to
trim the size of the church-owned paper and ``drastically cut'' its
staff.
   Katherine Fanning and two of her top assistants, David Anable,
managing editor, and David Winder, assistant managing editor of the
paper, announced their resignations Monday.
   Fanning said her resignation also came after a decision to allow
business manager, John Hoagland, control over content, which she
said ``threatens the editorial independence.''
   ``The increasing diversion of church funds from the Monitor to
other media, the decision to downsize the paper and drastically cut
its staff means the serious weakening of its editorial substance,''
she said after stepping down from her post.
   But Hoagland said the changes were positive. ``We expect that
this new alignment, plus revenues from our new products, will help
support our daily newspaper,'' he said of the 80-year-old paper that
has a Monday through Friday circulation of 170,000. ``We continue
with an unwavering commitment to offer both print and broadcast
services.''
   Fanning, 61, said in a statement that the church had decided to
cut the daily size of the newspaper to 16 pages from its current
average of 28 pages and to eliminate advertising.
   ``I leave this superb editorial staff with great sadness and
profound respect,'' she said.
   The paper has lost money for years but is widely respected by its
readers and by the newspaper industry. Hoagland said redesign and
other changes to be implemented in February of next year would be
revealed in the next few weeks.
   Directors of the church named Richard Nenneman, general manager
of print publishing for the church, as editor in chief in charge of
editorial content for the newspaper and all of its print and
broadcast enterprises. Richard Cattani, editor of the editorial
page, was named editor.
   Fanning became the first woman editor of the Monitor in 1983
after leaving the Daily News in Anchorage, Alaska, where she served
as publisher and editor for 12 years. After starting out at the
paper as a $2-per-hour librarian, she and her late husband, Larry
Fanning, bought the News in 1967.
   She served as president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors from April 1987 to April 1988.
   Supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the church $20
million a year, while the church seeks to establish a monthly
newsmagazine, radio and television programs.

   Space shuttle managers will set a
launch date Wednesday for a secret military mission to be flown by
five astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis.
   The current target is Nov. 30, but Conrad Nagel, Atlantis'
processing director, said Monday, ``I think we're looking real hard
now at Dec. 1'' because of a few outstanding technical problems.
   He said both dates would be submitted as options to shuttle
managers, who began a two-day flight readiness review today.
   Nagel spoke with reporters following the completion of a
countdown simulation for the flight. The five astronauts who will
fly the mission climbed aboard Atlantis for the final two hours to
run through launch day procedures.
   The exercise was termed ``very successful'' by Nagel, who
reported the only significant problem involved communications with
Mission Control Center in Houston. He said that would take one or
two days to correct.
   He also reported some trouble getting accustomed to a new
communications system that will be used because the shuttle will be
carrying a classified military payload.
   The mission will be the second for the shuttle program since the
Challenger explosion killed its seven crew members in January 1986.
Following a 32-month standdown for major modifications, the program
resumed on Sept. 29 with the successful launch of Discovery and a
five-man crew.
   In contrast to the fanfare surrounding the Discovery mission,
most details about the upcoming flight are not being made public.
Atlantis will be making the third Defense Department shuttle flight
dedicated solely to military experiments.
   Sources report the astronauts will deploy an
intelligence-gathering satellite intended to fly over 80 percent of
the Soviet Union and also conduct tests aimed at trying to define
man's role as a military observer in space.
   The astronauts assigned to the mission are commander Robert
Gibson, pilot Guy Gardner and mission specialists Mike Mullane,
Jerry Ross and William Shepherd.

<HEAD>Hitler's Autobiography Banned At U.S.-Operated Bookstores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials have
ordered a bookstore chain catering to American soldiers to stop
selling Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic book ``Mein Kampf,'' an official
said today.
   Hitler's book has been banned at the 158 Stars and Stripes
bookstores in Germany, said Deane McDermott, circulation manager for
the U.S. government organization in Darmstadt.
   ``Mein Kampf'' and other Nazi literature have been banned in
Germany for decades, McDermott said, but Stars and Stripes stores
had been selling about 70 copies a month of the book.
   ``It is against German law even to display the book,'' McDermott
said. ``We're guests in Germany and I think we should show certain
respect to our hosts.''
   McDermott said the subject of Nazism has become increasingly
sensitive in recent days following last week's 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht and former German parliament speaker Philipp
Jenninger's controversial speech marking the occasion.
   Kristallnacht, meaning Crystal Night, was a night of terror when
Nazi sympathizers burned and looted Jewish businesses and synagogues
in what is considered the beginning of the Holocaust. Under the
Holocaust, 6 million Jews were systematically killed.
   Jenninger was forced to resign as president of the Bundestag, or
parliament, after an awkward and inflammatory explanation of
Hitler's appeal to the German people. Jenninger said many Germans
considered Hitler's march through Europe ``triumphal'' and he
bluntly referred to the widespread anti-Semitism among Germans that
allowed Hitler's repression of Jews.
   Vandalism at Jewish cemeteries by presumed neo-Nazi groups also
has been reported over the past few days in Wiesbaden, Bad Buchau
and Berlin.
   Sales of ``Mein Kampf,'' ``My Struggle'' in English, at Stars and
Stripes stores came to the attention of American military officials
in Berlin last week when a television program, ``Abendschau,''
showed one of its reporters purchasing the book at the store in
Berlin's Truman Plaza.
   The book is filled with anti-Semitic outpourings and describes a
struggle for world domination.
   Heinz Galinski, West Germany's Jewish community leader, was
interviewed during the TV program and expressed dismay that the U.S.
stores were selling Hitler's book.
   McDermott said patrons are supposed to show their military
identification cards when shopping at the stores. He said the German
TV crew had received special permission from Stars and Stripes to
enter the Berlin store.
   ``There has been an awful lot of publicity on the Kristallnacht
anniversary and Philipp Jenninger's speech, and I think this all
came about because of that,'' McDermott said.
   About half of Stars and Stripes' 199 bookstores in Europe had
been selling Hitler's publication since about 1983, McDermott said.
   The order to remove ``Mein Kampf'' from the stores came on Friday
from Gen. Raymond Haddock, the U.S. commander in Berlin.
   On Monday, about 600 copies of the book were removed from the
German-based stores.

<HEAD>Boy Doing Well After Receiving Liver Slated for Girl</HEAD>

   A woman who agreed to let another mother's
child have a liver transplant ahead of her own daughter because the
boy needed it more says she is confident her daughter will get a
transplant eventually.
   ``Believe you me, I'm not any special person,'' said Penny
Thomas, whose 6-year-old daughter, Candi, was listed in fair
condition today at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Five-year-old Jason Point, who received the liver originally
intended for Candi, also was listed in fair condition today at the
hospital.
   ``I'm sure anyone would have to do it. I do have faith and I do
believe that in turn, Candi will get hers in time,'' Mrs. Thomas
said.
   Mrs. Thomas' daughter was lying outside the operating room
waiting for her transplant on Nov. 1, when doctors discovered that
Jason's liver was gangrenous. Doctors predicted that the boy would
live only another day or two without a transplant.
   Mrs. Thomas and Jason's mother, Nancy Point, were in a waiting
room at the hospital renewing a friendship established because both
of their children had already undergone one transplant shortly after
birth, Mrs. Thomas said.
   Doctors had placed the girl under aesthesia to give her a new
liver when the children's surgeon appeared, Mrs. Thomas said. Mrs.
Point was awaiting test results on Jason.
   ``Dr. (Thomas) Starzl came up. He told us that Candi needs the
liver ... but Jason is going to die in 24 to 48 hours because he has
gangrene of the liver,'' Mrs. Thomas recalled.
   ``He said, `What do we do?' and that's when we offered to give
Jason the liver,'' said Mrs. Thomas, adding that the doctors then
sent the girl back to her room.
   ``It was wonderful. Penny didn't hesitate for an instant,''
Jason's mother said.
   ``Circumstances brought us all together at the same time,'' Mrs.
Point said. ``All those circumstances fitting together ... a movie
script couldn't be more bizarre than this.''
   ``At the time my body was numb,'' said Mrs. Thomas. ``There was
just no other way to do it.''
   Jason was born with intrahepatic hypoplasia, which means the
liver was too small for his body and functioned at only 2 percent.
   Candi was also born with a birth defect. Both children had
received their first liver transplants in their first year of life.

<TEXT>
   Troops in armored personnel carriers
today patrolled cities on the eve of national elections, and
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan made a national appeal for peace during
the balloting.
   In Rawalpindi, a bomb hidden under wooden carts exploded in a
market, killing one person. Nobody immediately claimed
responsibility for the explosion and authorities refused to
speculate whether it was related to Wednesday's polls.
   Khan went on national television to urge Pakistan's voters to go
to the polls Wednesday and to accept the results peacefully. The
race is expected to be close between left-leaning populist leader
Benazir Bhutto and a nine-party conservative alliance.
   Ishaq Khan said heavy military and police security would be used
to prevent anyone from creating ``an atmosphere of fear or danger.''
The government has said it is deploying hundreds of thousands of
troops.
   ``A healthy tradition of respect for the public verdict through
the polls will, God willing, be established this time,'' Ishaq Khan
said. ``Gratitude and humbleness for the winners and patience and
tolerance for the defeated ones should be the hallmark of behavior
after the polls.''
   An undetermined number of people were injured by the Rawalpindi
bomb, which was planted under some wooden carts in a market, police
said.
   A similar device failed to explode an hour earlier in the same
city, adjacent to the capital, Islamabad. The bomb, concealed in an
empty cannister at a bicycle stand, only gave off sparks, police
said.
   Pakistani officials blame a wave of terrorist bombings over the
past two years on agents of neighboring Afghanistan's communist
government. Pakistan backs Moslem insurgents fighting to oust the
Marxists.
   Election officers have prepared 33,500 polling stations for
Wednesday's vote.
   Leaders of some 30 political parties contesting the National
Assembly polls conferred with their aides after the campaign
officially ended midnight Monday.
   The election promises to be Pakistan's first polls open to
political parties in more than a decade.
   A 25-member international delegation sponsored by the
Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs will monitor polling unofficially.
   Troops in armored personnel carriers and sandbagged bunkers
watched over the southern cities of Karachi and Hyderabad, scene of
a bloodbath in September that killed almost 300 people.
   Both Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and the
center-right Islamic Democratic Alliance predicted a sweep of the
vote. No reliable public opinion polls were published.
   At stake Wednesday are seats in the 217-member National Assembly.
On Saturday, voters elect 483 legislators to the four provincial
assemblies.
   Official statistics indicate there are about 48 million eligible
voters in this Moslem nation of 107 million people. The Federal
Election Commission ordered voters to present state identity cards
at polling stations to prevent fraud.
   The last open elections in Pakistan were held in 1977 under Ms.
Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar ali Bhutto.
   However, Gen. Zia seized power in a military coup shortly
afterward and nullified the results, alleging they were rigged. Two
years later, Zia ordered Bhutto hanged, allegedly for complicity in
a murder plot.
   Zia ruled under martial law for eight years before holding
national elections in 1985 on a non-party basis. Opposition parties
boycotted the polls.
   Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others were killed in
an Aug. 17 crash of Zia's C-130 transport plane. Officials suspect
sabotage as the cause, but investigations are continuing.

   A former U.S. hostage testified
today at the trial of confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi that
she still suffers nightmares more than three years after the ordeal.
   ``I have had nightmares and I'm scared of flying on planes,''
said Marypat Weber, a 21-year-old student. Under court guidelines to
protect witnesses, she did not state her hometown in the United
States.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 from Athens to
Rome. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed during the hijacking
and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi interrupted the trial today, saying ``I am very exhausted.
I feel very dizzy.''
   The session was adjourned for nearly an hour while a doctor
examined him and told the court he was suffering dizzy spells,
headaches and could not concentrate.
   The doctor, who was not identified, gave Hamadi an injection of
glucose for circulation irregularities.
   She also said Hamadi had been eating very little, but was not on
a hunger strike. She said medicine he was taking to counter low
blood pressure may have accentuated his weakened condition.
   Hamadi interrupted testimony by Ms. Weber's father, Dr. Burton
Weber, 48.
   Asked by the judge if he could return to Frankfurt to conclude
his testimony, Weber replied: ``My daughter and I felt that it was
unsafe for us to remain in Germany after the testimony.''
   The trial was adjourned until Monday, but Weber still was
negotiating a return date.
   His daughter, Marypat, who was returning from a Greek vacation
with her parents and sister when the jetliner was seized, told the
court she thought Hamadi directed the hijacking.
   ``I personally felt that Hamadi was more in charge and that he
was the leader,'' she said.
   Hamadi says the hijacking was directed by his accomplice,
fugitive Hassam Ezzeddin.
   Hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing
Stethem and testimony by several passsengers that he stole money and
jewelry.
   ``He took three rings and three chains from me,'' Ms. Weber said.
``One wouldn't come off, so he kept trying to rip it off.''
   Asked to comment by the court, Hamadi said: ``This is not
correct. I never stretch my hand for something like this. I never
did anything like this.''
   Describing her fears during the hijacking, Ms. Weber said, ``the
longer it continued, the more I was afraid. I didn't know if I was
going to live or die.''
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 when
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States requested Hamadi's extradition last year, but
the West German government turned it down, fearing for the lives of
the German hostages held in Beirut at the time.
   The hostages since have been released.

<HEAD>Hirohito Gets First Transfusion In a Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors gave Emperor Hirohito a blood transfusion
today to combat anemia, a palace official said. It was the emperor's
first transfusion in a week after two months of almost daily
transfusions.
   ``The transfusion ... was to combat acute anemia and loss of
vital force,'' Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
``No signs have been found that His Majesty discharged blood since a
week ago.''
   Hirohito, 87, the world's longest-reigning monarch, coughed up
blood on Sept. 19 and has since been bedridden with internal
hemorrhaging from the upper intestinal area where he underwent a
bypass operation in September 1987.
   His received his last transfusion Nov. 8 when his blood pressure
suddenly plummeted and his temperature soared.
   The frail emperor has received 42 pints of blood since the onset
of his crisis. He is being fed intravenously, and news reports say
his weight has fallen to about 77 pounds, down from 110 pounds when
he was healthy.
   ``Except for anemia, the emperor remained in stable condition. It
wouldn't mean, however, His Majesty's condition is improving. He
talks less and falls into sleep more often,'' Maeda told reporters
in a daily briefing.
   The monarchs's temperature dropped to 99.1 degrees following the
transfusion, compared to 99.7 this morning, palace officials said.
His normal temperature is about 95.9.
   Hirohito's blood pressure was 134 over 60, against 138 over 50 in
the morning. A healthy person normally has a reading of around 120
over 80, the palace reported.
   Palace officials have refused comment on reports that Hirohito
has pancreatic cancer.

   Mother Teresa ended a one-week trip
to South Africa today with a visit to a vast black squatter camp,
and a pro-government newspaper praised her for declining to discuss
politics during her stay.
   The 78-year-old nun, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize,
visited an old age home, a church and a high school in Winterveld, a
shantytown of 500,000 blacks north of Pretoria in the nominally
independent black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   At each stop, Mother Teresa was welcomed by cheering crowds and
gave brief speeches urging people to love one another.
   At the start of her visit, Mother Teresa told reporters she would
not become involved in political debate and added: ``I did not know
that something like apartheid existed.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg daily, praised Mother
Teresa for not making political statements and said she was more
worthy of praise than Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, also winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize. It described Tutu as a ``political priest
whose pronouncements cause division.''

   Arrest warrants were issued today for former
Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson and two other officials of
the U.S. multinational in connection with the 1984 Bhopal gas
disaster.
   On Dec. 3, 1984, more than 3,100 people were killed and at least
20,000 injured when toxic gas leaked out of a tank at a pesticide
plant operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   Chief judicial magistrate R.C. Mishra issued the arrest warrants
today after Anderson and the two Carbide officials failed to honor
summonses to appear in the Bhopal magistrate's court to answer
murder charges.
   The summonses for Anderson and the two others were issued last
December when the murder charges were filed in conjunction with the
Indian government's still unresolved $3 billion damage suit against
Union Carbide.
   Mishra issued the arrest warrants in response to a request by
government prosecutor U.S. Prasad.
   ``They are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law,''
Prasad said.
   The arrest warrants were issued for Anderson; John MacDonald,
assistant secretary of Union Carbide Corp., and Peter J. Whitley,
attorney for Union Carbide Eastern Inc., a Hong Kong-based
subsidiary.
   Earl Slack, assistant director of corporate communications at
Union Carbide's Danbury, Conn., headquarters, said the Indian courts
have no jurisdiction over Union Carbide or Anderson.
   ``Union Carbide Corp. is not an Indian corporation, it has no
presence in India and under Indian law can have no presence in
India,'' Slack said.
   MacDonald and Whitley had not been named individually in the
summonses issued last December, but Prasad sought orders for their
arrests, saying they had received the earlier summonses on behalf of
their companies.
   Prasad said the Indian government may initiate extradition
proceedings if the three men ignore the arrest warrants.
   In issuing the warrants, Mishra said the trio could be released
on $1,000 bond each after appearing in magistrate's court.
   As a magistrate, Mishra is not conducting any actual trial on
charges filed in the case. But his job empowers him to preside over
some procedural matters, such as failure to answer summonses and
whether to commit a case to trial in a higher court.
   The only Union Carbide representative present today was Rajendra
Singh, an attorney for Union Carbide India Ltd., the subsidiary that
operated the Bhopal pesticide plant.
   Singh did not speak about the arrest warrants, but he argued the
murder case should be sent for trial without any other accused
persons appearing in court. The Indian subsidiary is a defendant in
the $3 billion damage suit, and eight of its officers were named
when the murder charges filed last December.
   Prasad, however, argued that the murder case should not be sent
for trial unless Anderson, MacDonald and Whitley appear in court.
   Mishra set Jan. 6 as the date for hearing detailed arguments on
whether the murder case should be committed for trial.
   The damage suit against Union Carbide was filed in 1986 and is
still being heard in Bhopal District Court. It has bogged down in a
series of legal maneuverings, a common occurrence in India, where
court cases can drag on for years and even decades.
   The Indian government has accused Union Carbide of negligence for
the gas leak. Union Carbide says the leak of lethal methyl
isocyanate gas was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

<TEXT>
   Gainesville's daily newspaper has agreed
to pay the expected $15,000 cost of a special county referendum
because its omission of a legal advertisement made the special vote
necessary.
   The referendum on Nov. 29 will be on establishment of an enhanced
911 emergency telephone system.
   ``We have acknowledged forthrightly that the omission of the
legal advertisement created a problem, an expensive one,'' said
Denise Bannister, publisher of The Times. ``We made a mistake and we
will pay the cost of the special election.''
   Ms. Bannister's statement Monday came after the Hall County
Commission voted to ask The Times to pay for the election.
   The ad announcing a referendum was omitted from the Oct. 11 issue
of the newspaper, making it illegal for the county to place the
question on the Nov. 8 ballot. The newspaper agreed that county
employees were not at fault in the omission of the ad.
   In the referendum, voters will be asked if they want to pay
$160,000 for the enhanced 911 system, which proponents say would
speed up the response to emergency calls and allow faster tracing of
victims who need help.

   Canada today opened a sweeping general inquiry
into the use of illegal drugs in athletics after sprinter Ben Johson
was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using steroids.
   Ontario Associate Chief Justice Charles Dubin, appointed by the
federal government, said the investigation would examine drug abuse
in all Canadian athletics except professional sports.
   ``This is not an inquiry merely into the conduct of one or more
individuals,'' said Dubin, referring to the issue of whether Johnson
used anabolic steroids, as drug tests showed after his Olympic
victory.
   Johnson maintains that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance
his performances, capped by the world record 9.79 second, 100-meter
race at Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 24.
   Dubin said the inquiry also would examine if too much pressure
was being placed on Canadian athletes to encourage them to cheat.
   ``Are Canadian athletes being exploited by others ... who would
risk reputation or health?'' he asked.
   Canadian euphoria at Johnson's victory over Carl Lewis of the
United States quickly turned to sadness and disgrace as he was
stripped of the medal.
   ``I would never embarrass my family, my friends, my country and
the kids who love me,'' Johnson said after his return from Seoul.
   Some remained loyal, and T-shirts appeared with the slogan, ``Ben
Didn't Do It.'' They have slipped out of store display windows as
the weeks since the Olympics passed.
   Ironically, the hearings start at a time when Canadians are
enmeshed in an unusually passionate debate on their national
identity as part of the campaign for next Monday's national election.
   At stake is the free trade agreement with the United States
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
   Opponents of the pact argue that Canada faces a tremendous threat
to its national identity and could be overwhelmed by the more
populous and wealthier United States.
   They point to a sense of fairness and community as being central
to the concept of Canadian nationality.
   In the other incident this year of total national absorption in
sports, hockey hero Wayne Gretzky abandoned Edmonton, Alberta, to
pursue a more lucrative, flashier career in Los Angeles.
   Susan Butt, a sports psychologist at the University of British
Columbia, said Canadians ``have that tendency'' of placing the
national ego on the line over an athletic event.
   ``Hopefully, we can all educate ourselves to become more
realistic and mature about sports,'' she said in a phone interview,
adding that the hearings on drug abuse are ``a wonderful opportunity
for Canada to lead instead of being burdened with it.''
   Harold Minden, a psychologist from Toronto's York University who
traveled to Seoul with the Canadian Olympic team, said he was
surprised by the tremendous response to Johnson's victory and the
subsequent rush to judge him in public opinion.
   ``They really were a little overwhelmed and ecstatic when he won,
then went down in the basement of emotion when he lost (the
medal),'' Minden said.
   Burt Konzak, an expert in sports psychology at the University of
Toronto, said the hearings should examine the competitive pressures
put on Johnson and the excessive push for Canada to win a gold medal
in a high-profile event.
   ``Why were we so lax in testing our own athletes? It was because
we wanted a winner,'' he said.
   Dubin led a federal inquiry into airline safety several years
ago. He can call witnesses, require testimony, hire expert advisers
and take the hearings anywhere in Canada or out of the country.
   Among the most eagerly awaited witnesses are Johnson; his coach,
Charlie Francis; and Dr. Jamie Astaphan, the physician who treated
the athlete.
   Johnson has been banned from competition for two years by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs world track
and field.

   A man who successfully sued the government for
medical malpractice, blaming it for what he said was near total
blindness, has been convicted of fraud and perjury.
   Friends and neighbors testified they had seen Lowell Hedgecorth
mowing his lawn, reading, playing cards and even driving a car.
   Hedgecorth, 54, of St. Ann, was awarded $825,000 in 1984 when he
sued the government, claiming he lost nearly all of his vision when
he suffered a stroke in a stress test administered at the John
Cochran Veterans Adminstration Hospital here.
   The damage award was later overturned after the judge in the case
learned of Hedgecorth's activities. Hedgecorth was indicted on four
counts of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of
perjury stemming from his testimony in the civil suit. One charge of
mail fraud was later dismissed.
   In closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Steitz
noted that Hedgecorth had passed a vision test when renewing his
driver's license.
   Steitz recounted testimony of a radiologist who testified that
Hedgecorth's brain showed no evidence of the kind of stroke it would
take to blind him.
   Thomas Cotter, Hedgecorth's attorney, said his client had simply
adapted to his impairment. He cited the testimony of several blind
and visually impaired witnesses, all of whom said they knew of
legally blind people who occasionally drove cars.
   Hedgecorth faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in
fines. Sentencing was set for Dec. 23.

Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of job-related injuries and illnesses
increased by 5 percent last year, with 351,000 more injuries and
53,000 more illnesses reported, the government said today.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics said 83 of every 1,000 workers
experienced some kind of job-related illness or injury last year
compared with 79 of every 1,000 workers in 1985 and 1986.
   Meanwhile, job-related fatalities in surveyed private businesses
with 11 or more employees dropped from 3,610 in 1986 to 3,400 last
year. BLS officials called the decline ``statistically
insignificant.''
   The increase in injury and illness rates was the first since 1984.
   A total of 5,843,100 workers were injured on the job last year
compared with 5,492,000 in 1986, the bureau said.
   Nearly half of the injuries were so severe that employees lost a
full day or more of work and the number of work days lost totaled
48.8 million, compared with 45.4 million work days lost to injuries
in 1986.
   Some 190,000 workers suffered new illnesses for the first time,
most of them involving noise-related hearing losses, skin diseases
and repetitive motion ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome
prevalent in the meatpacking industry.
   That is a 28 percent increase over the 136,900 new cases of
job-related illnesses reported in 1986.
   The bureau said chronic and long-term latent cases that are often
difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in
the illness statistics ``but are clearly understated.''
   Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood said the increase
in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better
recordkeeping due to new government guidelines and intensive efforts
to improve the statistics.
   The National Academy of Sciences last year questioned validity of
the government's job health and safety data because of ``severe
underreporting'' by employers to avoid workmen's compensation claims
or government inspections.
   An academy panel said the actual number of job-related fatalities
could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has placed a
new emphasis on accurate records, levying hundreds of fines, some of
them in the millions of dollars, against employers for not reporting
job-related injuries or illnesses.
   Of the 3,400 reported on-the-job fatalities last year, two-thirds
occurred in the construction, manufacturing, transportation or
public utility industries. As in previous years, the single biggest
cause was traffic accidents, accounting for about one-third of the
deaths, the government said.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Cuba, Angola and South Africa today
agreed on a proposal that could be the basis of a regional peace
package for southern Africa, a South African official said.
   ``All parties have agreed to take a document home to their
governments,'' Pretoria's chief negotiator Neil Van Heerden told
reporters. He said the document would be the basis for a final
agreement ``if the parties accept it.''
   ``This could open the door to Brazzaville,'' he said, referring
to the Congolese capital which is the proposed site for the final
meeting in a U.S.- mediated peace effort.
   There was no immediate, independent confirmation of Van Heerden's
comments.
   Van Heerden met reporters after a plenary meeting led by U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker on the fifth day of
talks. He said no deadlines had been set for finishing the process.
   The main issue remaining in the peace effort, begun in May, is
setting a timetable for the withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops backing Angola's Marxist government in their fight against
U.S.- and Pretoria-backed UNITA rebels. Also to be resolved is a
framework for ending South Africa's 73-year control over South-West
Africa, or Namibia.
   A U.S. plan put forth in October reportedly calls for a gradual
two-year withdrawal of Cuban troops. Cuba has sought a 2{-year
timetable.
   The target date for the start of the pullout is said to be Jan.
1, the same day on which a U.N.-supervised process for bringing
independence to South-West Africa would begin.
   South African officials have tried to link the withdrawal of
Cuban troops to independence in South-West Africa.
   South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, lies between South
Africa and Angola.

   Pungent smoke from an underground landfill
fire spread for miles today as firefighters spent a fifth day
battling a blaze that is keeping 25 families from their homes.
   ``This morning, when people got up in Saratoga Springs, they
awoke to clouds of steamy, smelly smoke,'' said Paul Lent, Saratoga
County emergency services director.
   A temperature inversion kept cloud cover low overnight, and smoke
from the unlicensed landfill about three miles west of Saratoga
Springs couldn't dissipate, Lent said.
   ``The smell that people complained about doesn't mean that it's
getting worse. It actually means that we're making headway,'' Lent
said.
   Overnight, workers continued their ``wet and smother'' strategy
against the blaze, which started Thursday night.
   Water and air sample results should be available later today,
which would determine if the evacuated residents can go home, Lent
said. While the dump owner has claimed there was nothing toxic in
the landfill, low levels of PCBs were found in the smoke. State
Health Department officials said the level of the chemicals did not
exceed federal safety standards.
   The city of Saratoga Springs kept in effect a health alert for
residents of its west side, and Lent said all residents bothered by
the smoke were being advised to stay indoors.
   Bulldozers and dump trucks dug trenches Monday on two sides of
the smoldering area while acrid smoke poured from about two acres of
the 17-acre landfill.
   One trench, 30 feet wide by 30 feet deep and 400 feet long, was
filled with dirt Monday to form a firebreak similar to those used in
forest fires, Lent said. The other was to be filled in today, he
said.
   It might take days to extinguish the fire, he said.
   Saratoga Hospital reported 35 people, most of them firefighters,
had been treated for respiratory problems from the smoke. No serious
injuries have been reported.
   Lent said the dump contains plastic piping, gypsum board, wood
and other building materials placed there by its owner, John Rock,
who has been charged with operating a dump without a permit.

   The pilot of a small plane that crashed
into a shopping mall filled with Christmas shoppers and killed seven
people covered up serious medical problems, a jury was told.
   About 70 people are seeking $35 million in damages in connection
with the Dec. 23, 1985, crash at the Sunvalley Mall in Concord.
Opening arguments began Monday.
   Beech Aircraft, which built the plane in 1962, and General Air
Services, which inspected and maintained it, are defendants in a
civil trial to determine whether they should bear any liability for
the crash.
   Beech Aircraft Corp. lawyer William Owen said the crash was
caused solely by pilot error when James Graham, 67, became
disoriented in heavy fog. Graham and his two passengers were among
those killed. In addition, more than 70 people were injured.
   Owen said Graham lied to doctors who examined him for annual
flight physicals in 1983, 1984 and 1985 by saying in answer to a
questionnaire item that he hadn't seen any doctors during the
previous year.
   Graham also stated in 1985 that he was not using any medication
when he was taking blood-pressure medicine that can cause
drowsiness, Owen said.
   ``There is no way in the world,'' Owen said that Graham could
have passed his 1985 flight physical if he had disclosed his high
blood pressure.
   Owen said Graham had been taking an amphetamine daily, was
receiving injections of testosterone, a steroid, at least twice a
month, suffered from a sleeping disorder called early narcolepsy and
sometimes fell asleep in his car or at his desk.
   Gerald Sterns, an attorney for the plaintiffs, contended that the
plane had a defectively designed left engine that performed
improperly.

<HEAD>Legal Affairs Chief Chastises Estonian Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's chief of legal affairs
chastised Estonian leaders for encouraging nationalism and
increasing political tension in their tiny republic, Tass said today.
   Politburo member Viktor M. Chebrikov said the Central Committee
of the Estonian party had ``committed serious miscalculations in the
areas of inter-ethnic relations,'' the official news agency said.
   Chebrikov, whose visit likely was meant as a message to Estonians
to tread cautiously, made the remarks in a speech Monday to Estonian
party, government and economic officials.
   ``It is necessary to seek what unites rather than divides,'' said
Chebrikov, who was head of the KGB until September, when Gorbachev
appointed him to his present post.
   The growth of ethnic tensions in the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia, as well as the southern republics of Armenia
and Azerbaijan have become a severe test of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's program of greater openness and economic reforms.
   Party and government officials in Estonia have joined activists
in demanding greater economic and political autonomy from Moscow.
   Last week, they said in a meeting with Gorbachev in Moscow that
the Soviet leader's intended reform of the political system would
take away many of their republic's rights rather than increase local
control.
   On Monday, Chebrikov assured Estonian leaders that the Kremlin
was pleased more people were getting involved in public issues and
gaining a stronger ethnic identity. But he said ethnic feelings were
going too far.
   Chebrikov told the Estonian officials ``the situation in the
republic is characterized by a growing political tension,'' Tass
said.
   He described as especially alarming the division of the
population along ethnic lines, Tass said.
   Chebrikov went to Estonia on Friday, the same day two other
Politburo members were sent to the Baltic on similar missions. Vadim
Medvedev, the Kremlin ideology chief, went to the republic of Latvia
and Nikolai Slyunkov, chief of social and economic development,
visited the republic of Lithuania.
   Tass reported the Medvedev and Slyunkov visits, but their
speeches to officials were not as sharp as Chebrikov's in Estonia,
where the reform movement has been the most active and organized.

   The PLO's parliament-in-exile proclaimed
an independent Palestinian state today, and PLO chief Yasser Arafat
said the decision now puts ``the ball ... in the American court.''
   The Palestine National Council made the declaration early today,
approving a new political program that indirectly recognizes Israel.
   Council delegates broke into applause and the occasion was
immediately followed by quiet handshakes, kisses and an occasional
tear.
   At a news conference later, Arafat described the council meeting
as the ``intefadeh (uprising) session,'' referring to 11 months of
unrest by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``But it could also be the session of peace with the U.S.
Administration and Israel,'' he said.
   In a more threatening tone, he added: ``Let it also be clear I
can always come back to our (council) and declare that moderation
does not pay.''
   ``Our political statement contains moderation, flexibility and
realism, which the West has been urging us to show, Arafat said.
``The ball is now in the American court.''
   Earlier today, Israeli troops sealed off the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where Arab youths took to the streets to celebrate the
declaration and underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising
called a general strike.
   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, under curfew for the first
time since 1967, teen-agers ignored threats of fines and jail terms
to run through the streets setting off fireworks and singing a
nationalist song.
   Arafat did not describe the new state's borders, except to say
that a 1947 U.N. plan that provided for separate Jewish and Arab
states in Palestine still provides the basis for ``international
legitimacy.'' The Palestinian territory referred to in the
declaration presumably meant the West Bank and Gaza, captured by
Israel in 1967 Middle East war.
   Passage of the proclamation could mark a turning point in the
four-decade struggle through repeated Arab-Israeli wars and
recurrent guerrilla attacks. Israel gained independence in 1948,
when British rule ended.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization declaration will not
necessarily have any immediate effect because the PLO is unable to
challenge Israel for actual control, either in the occupied
territories or in Israel proper.
   PLO leaders consider it rather as a historic step toward creation
of an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Israel rejected any change in its attitude toward the PLO even
before the new policy was officially approved.
   ``It's not a problem of definition and formulations of various
positions,'' said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``We'll not
negotiate with them because they're opposed to peace with Israel.''
   The declaration says: ``The Palestine National Council, in the
name of God, and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people, hereby
proclaims the establishment of the state of Palestine on our
Palestinian territory with its capital Jerusalem.''
   A less symbolic but equally important move was the new
Palestinian political program, which clearly aims to overcome the
major objections put forth by the United States as reasons for not
dealing with the PLO.
   The council, the PLO's highest policy-making body, issued a
political declaration accepting U.N. Security Council Resolution 242
_ which implicity recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   The declaration also rejects terrorism, restricting PLO guerrilla
action to military targets in the occupied territories, which 1.5
million Palestinians share uneasily with 70,000 Jewish settlers.
   In Washington, the initial response was cautious. President
Reagan said the PLO action could represent progress, but added there
were ``other problems that remain to be solved.''
   The United States has demanded the PLO recognize Israel and
renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings.
   Resolution 242 calls for Israeli withdrawal from territories it
seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. The PLO
had in the past rejected it because of the recognition of the Jewish
state and because it referred to the Palestinian question as a
refugee problem.
   The Palestine National Council's political declaration calls for
the convening of an international Middle East peace conference under
U.N. auspicies and with participation of the permanent member states
of the U.N. Security Council and all parties to the conflict,
including the PLO.
   It also calls for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, Gaza and Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, and for putting
the occupied lands under U.N. supervision for a transitional period.
   The third item on the agenda of the council was approval of a
provisional government, to be formed at a later stage. That
government would be mandated to negotiate a peace settlement.
   For the moment, however, the government of the newly declared
Palestine is the PLO.
   The Palestine National Council is a 450-member bicameral
parliament-in-exile with members selected from PLO guerrilla
factions and professional unions. It was formed in 1964 by the Arab
League.

   A fire that broke out in a bathroom aboard
an Eastern Airlines jetliner was quickly extinguished and the plane
landed safely at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, authorities said.
   None of the 73 passengers and five crew members aboard the Monday
night Flight 52 from Miami to Detroit was hurt, said Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   A attendant and the first officer put out the fire with a fire
extinguisher before the plane landed, Ceremsak said.
   ``It was no big deal. Someone apparently was smoking in the
bathroom,'' said Cpl. Glen Hudson of the Wayne County Sheriff's
Department's Airport Division. Ceremsak said she couldn't confirm
the cause of the fire.
   Karen Ceremsak, spokeswoman for Easter Airlines in Miami, said
the flight was longer than two hours and therefore smoking was
allowed in the plane's smoking section. Federal law bans smoking on
shorter flights.

   Some campaign workers were arrested for violating a law that
prohibits campaigning within 100 yards of polling stations. They
tried to hand out sample ballots with their candidate's name written
in.
   However, no serious incidents were reported by early afternoon.
   People waitied patiently in lines up to four blocks long after
polls opened at 8 a.m. (5 a.m. EST). They were to close at 5 p.m. (2
p.m. EST).
   President Jose Sarney voted in his home state of Maranhao, in far
northern Brazil, then returned to Brasilia.
   Election results, not expected in full before Sunday, could
indicate how Brazilians will vote next November in the first
presidental elections in 29 years in Latin America's biggest and
most populous country.
   Voting is mandatory, and Brazilians who don't vote face trouble
getting a passport and obtaining a government loan or a civil
service job. But polls show voter apathy is high. Campaigns urging
voters to protest through voided ballots or to vote for nonsense
candidates _ such as a popular chimpanzee in Rio Zoo _ have
attracted national attention.
   At stake are mayorships and council seats in 4,307 cities and
towns.
   Campaigning by candidates from 29 parties has been unrestricted
in Brazil, which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21
years of right-wing military rule. Parties ranged from Communist
groups to supporters of the former military government.
   Although the voting is based largely on local matters, political
analysts say Brazilians will also be voicing their opinion on
Sarney's conservative-to-centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement
Party.
   Polls indicate that the party _ which in 1986 swept elections for
state governors, state assemblies and Congress _ will be lucky to
win the mayoral seats in three of Brazil's largest cities.
   The governing party has been blamed for the soaring inflation and
a 40 percent dip in workers' buying power. It has also faced charges
of corruption and nepotism.
   Last week, soldiers killed three workers at the state-run
National Steel Co. in a clash with strikers. Protest signs at the
workers' funerals said, ``Enough of Sarney.''
   Federal troops have been assigned to 207 cities in 13 states to
maintian order during voting.
   Sarney, a 58-year-old politician and poet, gained office as the
running mate of Tancredo Neves, who was chosen in a
military-controlled electoral college vote. Neves died shortly
before taking office.
   The leading mayoral candidates according to Brazilian polls were:
   _Sao Paulo, the country's largest and richest city: Paulo Salim
Maluf, 57, wealthy industrialist and the defeated military-backed
candidate for president in 1985. An appointed state governor and
mayor under the military regime, Maluf belongs to the former
regime's official Social Democratic Party.
   _Rio de Janeiro, the second-largest city: Marcello Alencar, 63, a
lawyer, journalist and former appointed mayor of Rio. He is from the
leftist Democratic Workers Party and an ally of Leonel Brizola, the
leading left-wing candidate for president in 1989.
   _Belo Horizonte, the No. 3 city: Joao Pimenta da Veiga Filho, 41,
of the left-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a rebel
breakaway group from Sarney's Democratic Movement.
   _Porto Alegre, largest city in Brazil's south: Olivio Dutra, 47,
militant bank workers union leader, federal congressman and member
of the far-leftist Workers' Party.
   _Fortaleza, largest city in Brazil's poor north: Ciro Gomes, 31,
a lawyer and constitutional law professor, from the Democratic
Movement.

<HEAD>Official Trade Unions Chief Challenges Walesa to TV Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today
accepted a challenge from the head of Poland's official trade union
alliance for a nationally televised debate on trade unions in Poland.
   Alfred Miodowicz, Politburo member and chairman of the OPZZ, the
All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions, made the challenge in an
interview in today's edition of the Communist Party newspaper
Trybuna Ludu.
   Publication of Miodowicz's offer in the official press appeared
to indicate the proposal already had official approval.
   ``All members of the government will be glad to sit in front of
their TV sets and listen to such a discussion,'' government press
spokesman Jerzy Urban said at his weekly news conference.
   The debate would be Walesa's first appearance on state television
since 1983, when he challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
F. Rakowski after Rakowski gave a televised speech at the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk. Rakowski became prime minister in September.
   Walesa accepted the invitation to debate in a statement today. No
date was announced.
   Poland's official trade unions were set up by the government in
1982 after the banning of Solidarity, the East bloc's first
independent union. Solidarity supporters say more than one union
should be allowed to exist in each workplace because official unions
are too tame and do not adequately represent workers' interests.
   Also today, Walesa addressed a rally of 3,000 workers in Gdansk
and told them he will support management plans to restructure and
save the Lenin Shipyard, Solidarity's birthplace. The government has
announced plans to liquidate the shipyard beginning Dec. 1.

<HEAD>Two Defendants in Ecclesia Child's Death Released Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has released two defendants and
reduced bail for the other two held in the beating death of the
daughter of Ecclesia Athletic Association founder Eldridge J.
Broussard Jr.
   The four face a joint manslaughter trial Dec. 12 in the Oct. 14
death of 8-year-old Dayna Lorea Broussard. She was among more than
50 children living at the association's religious-athletic camp near
Sandy.
   The four adults were supervising the children at the time.
   Her father, who was not charged, was then in Los Angeles, where
the group was founded. Broussard had said that his goal was to train
inner-city youth from the Watts area of Los Angeles to compete in
future Olympic Games.
   Neighbors in Oregon complained when the group moved there that
they saw children exercising for long periods of time and in
extremely hot weather.
   After the girl's death, the 53 remaining children, ages 1{ months
to 16 years, were taken into custody by Children's Services Division
officials.
   On Monday, Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe granted
defense motions for the release of Willie K. Chambers, 35, and
Constance Z. Jackson, 37. Lowe ordered them to remain in Oregon
until the trial, to contact their attorneys in person weekly and not
to be in charge of children under 18.
   Lowe reduced bail to $25,000 from $250,000 for Brian J. Brinson,
30, and Frederick P. Doolittle, 28.
   Ron Thom, a court-appointed attorney representing Brinson, told
Lowe that it was unlikely the defendants could post the reduced bail.
   In releasing Chambers and Jackson, Lowe said ``it appears that
they have substantial family relationships and ties to the
community,'' and said the lack of ties prompted him to only reduce
bail for Brinson and Doolittle.

   A strong earthquake today hit the southern area
devastated by a Nov. 6 quake in which more than 930 people died, but
official media reported no additional casualties.
   The Xinhua News Agency said the quake, which measured 5.7 on the
Richter scale, was one of the stronger aftershocks of last week's
deadly earthquake in Yunnan province near the Burmese border.
   The area has been hit by more than 1,300 aftershocks since the
Nov. 6 quake, which registered 7.6 on the Richter scale.
Seismologists have predicted one more strong tremor.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
with a measurement of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated
area. Each increase of one digit on the scale indicates a tenfold
increase in the strength of the quake.
   The Nov. 6 quake killed at least 938 people, injured more than
4,000 and left hundreds of thousands homeless, according to official
figures. It affected a wide swath of remote mountain terrain
inhabited mostly by farmers.
   Foreign reporters have not been allowed to visit the worst-hit
areas.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army today removed nine
more Pershing 2 nuclear missiles under a superpower treaty scrapping
all intermediate-range nuclear rockets, an Army spokesman said.
   Maj. Jerry Hart, spokesman for the 56th Field Artillery Command
in Schwaebisch Gmuend, said the missiles were transported by convoy
to a storage facility near Ramstein U.S. Air Force base in
southwestern Germany for shipment back to the United States.
   He said nine missile launchers were transported by separate
convoy to an Army facility outside Frankfurt, where they will be
destroyed.
   The shipments are the second withdrawal of Pershings from West
Germany. Nine were removed in September and their launchers
destroyed.
   The elimination is being carried out under the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Force treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last year in Washington.
   Before the superpower treaty was signed, the United States
maintained 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruise missiles at four
bases in West Germany.
   The first nine missiles removed were stationed at a base near
Heilbronn, south of Frankfurt.
   The Mutlangen base is located near Stuttgart, in southern Germany.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said today it had
canceled a meeting scheduled Wednesday of Deputy Secretary Joseph
Salgado and three western governors on low-level nuclear waste
issues because one governor could not be there.
   Doug Elmets, spokesman for Energy Secretary John S. Herrington,
said the department intends to send lower level officials to meet
with Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, who insisted on such a meeting.
   The governors of Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico had been
scheduled to meet Wednesday with Salgado in Salt Lake City.
   But Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico has to be in Washington
Wednesday to meet with members of President-elect George Bush's
transition team.
   Elmets said the department will try to reschedule the meeting
`hopefully, soon.''
   Herrington sought the meeting after Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus
refused to permit a boxcar of low-level waste such as contaminated
clothes and tools to unload at the department's Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory on Oct. 19.
   The waste originated from the department's weapons plant at Rocky
Flats, Colo. Romer allowed the car to come back to Rocky Flats,
where several carloads have accumulated.
   The waste has been stored at the Idaho installation for years,
pending opening of an underground storage repository in New Mexico.
   That opening has been delayed because Congress did not approve
legislation transferring the land from the Interior Department to
the Energy Department.
   Romer and Andrus complained about cancellation of the scheduled
meeting with Salgado, with Andrus calling it ``the latest instance
in a long line of indecision and delay'' by the Energy Department.
   ``As I suspected almost a month ago, DOE in Washington doesn't
have the slightest idea of what they are going to do to solve this
problem,'' Andrus said.

   Hundreds of prostitutes marched out of the
city's biggest red light district Tuesday night, demanding free
health care, education for their children and an end to police
harassment.
   The women, including aging brothel keepers who grew up in the
profession and supervise younger prostitutes, marched for four miles
through the streets of Bombay. A small delegation also met state
officials.
   About 800 women started the march, participants said, but by the
time they reached their rally site in south Bombay four hours later,
the number had dwindled to about 400.
   One marcher, Rukmanibai Bansode, 58, complained that some
prostitutes were starving. She said schools refused to admit their
children, and money lenders charged interest rates as high as 50
percent.
   The marchers were escorted by men from the Dalit Panthers, a
group formed in the 1970s to fight for the rights of the downtrodden.
   Other demands included protection from thugs and an end to
exploitation by money lenders.
   After a meeting with Maharashtra state Chief Minister Sharad
Pawar, the delegation announced to a cheering crowd that all their
demands had been granted. The government had no immediate comment.
   Bombay, a port city of 8 million people, has an estimated 100,000
prostitutes. About half live in central's Bombay's Kamathipura area.
   They do business openly, charging as little as $1.35, but
business has slacked off in recent months after one prostitute died
of AIDS.
   Minoo Irani, an assistant police commissioner, said a woman
engaging in prostitution does not violate a 1986 law that defined
prostitution as ``sexual exploitation for commercial gain.'' He said
it was illegal to solicit customers.
   ``We normally do not raid red light areas unless citizens
complain that minors are being detained,'' he said.

   Authorities have confiscated a private collection of
more than 45,000 prehistoric relics, fossils and artworks, officials
said Tuesday.
   The collection was found on the property of Piero Ceruleo, an
engineer from Tivoli, who told investigators that he had collected
the works in Italy and abroad in the past 20 years, according to
Italy's internal revenue and customs police.
   He was under investigation for suspicion of violating a law
requiring the registration of such relics. The law is aimed at
preventing their sale abroad.
   The relics, some of which date to the 5th century B.C., are being
studied by government archaeologists. They include various fossils,
prehistoric teeth, bones and arrowheads, and Etruscan and Roman
coins and sculpture.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet
with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush next month for
what Reagan called ``a brief get-together.''
   ``That's not going to be anything in the nature of a summit
meeting,'' the president said.
   Asked if Gorbachev might bring new proposals to the meeting, the
president said:
   ``I have no way of speculating. We'll just have to see what comes
up.''
   Reagan commented as he posed for photographers before a meeting
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Oval Office.
   ``We hope we can have a brief get-together,'' the president said
of the upcoming meeting, which will be his fifth with Gorbachev.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that neither a date nor a site
has been set, although he acknowledged that it would likely take
place in New York while Gorbachev is there to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
   Other officials, requesting anonymity, said Gorbachev would
probably meet with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7.
   Reagan, asked today if the December meeting could end up like the
summit in Iceland, to which Gorbachev brought surprise proposals on
arms control but from which no agreements flowed, the president
responded, ``That depends on whether you are going by the public
version of Reykjavik or what actually happened there.''
   He did not elaborate and reporters went on to other questions.
   When a reporter noted that Bush has said he does not need to get
acquainted with Gorbachev because he already is, the president
replied that the vice president ``has been involved in the meetings
that we've had in all these eight years we've been here and he has
met and is familiar with all the national leaders that we've met.
...''
   Asked, then, why Bush was going to be at the meeting, he said,
``I think now, in his present situation, it would be proper for him
to be present.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan and Bush would meet, probably together,
with Gorbachev, for what Fitzwater said was intended to be ``a
cordial meeting between superpower leaders reflecting the friendship
they have created and the historic change in the relationship
between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said Gorbachev would meet with the U.S. leaders as part of ``a
continuation of the U.S.-Soviet political dialogue that we believe
should continue without artificial pause.''
   Fitzwater said the main purpose of the meeting from the U.S.
standpoint would be to ``ensure that the momentum and continuity of
the arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the
relationship between the general secretary and the new president of
the United States.''
   ``I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling
things (differences),'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the Kremlin had proposed that
Gorbachev meet with Reagan and Bush in just the last few days and
that the administration had quickly approved the request.
   Gorbachev also will visit Britain and Cuba, the Soviet news
agency Tass aid in a dispatch from Moscow.
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev intends to appear in New York at the session
of the General Assembly of the U.N. to set forth the views of the
Soviet Union on the most important problems of world development,''
Tass said.
   Earlier, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, would visit London Dec. 12-14.
Buckingham Palace said today that Queen Elizabeth II also intended
to meet with Gorbachev.
   A get-together would also give the two sides another chance to
narrow the gap on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons
arsenals and to ease tensions caused by Afghan rebel attacks on
Soviet troops in Afghanistan and a slowdown in the Red Army's
withdrawal from the country.
   The treaty is bogged down with several technical problems that
may not be easily solved. But on Afghanistan, the Soviets already
have pledged to have all their forces out by Feb. 15.
   Two weeks ago, citing attacks by the U.S.-armed rebels, the
Soviets announced suspension of the withdrawal. Still, Gorbachev has
not ruled out adhering to the deadline set in last spring's Geneva
accords.
   A year ago, the Soviet leader made his first trip to the United
States. At a Washington summit with Reagan, he signed an
unprecedented treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear weapons.
   It was the first arms control treaty to actually reduce nuclear
arsenals. But a pact on strategic weapons, which are globe-girdling
and far more deadly, has continued to elude U.S. and Soviet
negotiators.
   Reagan and Gorbachev have held four annual meetings beginning in
1985, improving U.S.-Soviet relations on a number of fronts. Bush,
meanwhile, said after winning the presidency last week that he would
like to hold a summit meeting with the Soviet leader.
   Bush has set relatively easy conditions for a summit meeting with
the Soviet leader sometime after moving into the White House in
January. He asked only that it produce progress on arms control,
human rights or regional disputes.
   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, whom he
has named as his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with foreign ministers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Bush ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquainted
with him,'' the president-elect said of Gorbachev. ``What I want to
see is progress. I've never supported meetings just for the sake of
having meetings.''
   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in
November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Reykjavik,
Iceland, then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May
29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to reduce their
armories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50
percent, but are wrestling with problems over how to verify some of
the cutbacks.

   Spray-painted slogans reading ``AIDS Mormons''
and ``Mormons Go Home'' sometimes greet students walking to class at
the Mormon study center on the biblical Mount of Olives.
   The graffiti signals a renewal of anti-Mormon sentiment in
Jerusalem, especially among Orthodox Jews who fear the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is conducting missionary work at
its $15 million facility.
   Mormon officials deny the charge. But Orthodox leaders vow to use
the political muscle their parties gained in this month's national
elections to remove the Mormons from the Holy Land.
   ``We want them to leave and now we have room to do something
about it,'' said Rabbi Menachem Porush, whose Agudat Israel Party
won five seats in the Knesset, or parliament. ``The Mormons are very
dangerous. They have made it unsafe for Jews.''
   Porush contends the Mormons are trying ``to systematically
convert young Jews'' in violation of a lease agreement that forbids
missionary activities at their Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern
Studies.
   He said Orthodox leaders want the Israeli government to buy the
Mormon center and convert it into a religious high school for Jews.
   ``We would be more than happy to buy it from them,'' Porush said.
``We will pay any price.''
   Martin Hickman, the center's director, said the seven-story
marble and limestone building ``is not for sale.''
   He added that he expects the government to honor the Mormons'
49-year lease on the property despite the growing influence of
Orthodox parties.
   ``We realize there are certain groups that wish we weren't
here,'' Hickman said in an interview. ``But we respect the integrity
of the government of Israel, which has made a commitment that we
intend to keep.''
   Construction of the center began in 1984 after lengthy
negotiations between the Israeli government and the Mormon-operated
Brigham Young University in Utah, which runs the center. Approval
was given only after the Mormons pledged not to proselytize.
   The Mormon Church, with headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, has
some 6,500 congregations worldwide with more than 3 million members.
   Since its completion in January, the center has been supervised
by a five-member committee of three Israeli government officials and
two Mormon representatives.
   Haim Klugman, the Justice Ministry director-general who serves as
committee chairman, said there is no evidence the Mormons have
violated their agreement.
   ``We are here to deal with every complaint, but we have had
none,'' Klugman said.
   Hickman said the center's nine faculty members and 105 students
are well aware of the conditions of the lease and are careful not to
do or say anything that could be misinterpreted as missionary work.
   ``Some people think we're here to convert their Jewish state to a
Mormon state,'' said David Daines, 23, of Provo, Utah. A junior at
Brigham Young, Daines is a student at the Jerusalem center.
   ``I came here to study and to learn, not to proselytize,'' Daines
insisted. He said he ignored the graffiti.
   Students take courses for a four-month program that includes
Middle East history, archeology and Bible studies.
   Lisa Hillyard, 20, a native of Logan, Utah, and a junior from
Utah State University, said Israel's Orthodox Jews need not be
concerned despite the tradition of missionary work among young
Mormons.
   ``I understand that they were a little nervous about letting us
in,'' she said. ``But we gave our word.''
   Earlier this year, the American-born right-wing Rabbi Meir Kahane
and about 50 of his supporters marched near the center to demand its
closure. Kahane vowed to shut it down if he came to power.
   Porush contends the Mormons use the study center as a cover for
missionary activities from the Mount of Olives, where Christians
believe Christ ascended to heaven.
   He said the national elections, in which religious parties
captured 18 of the 120 seats in parliament, have put Orthodox Jews
in a position to scrutinize Mormon activities.
   ``We are not trying to hurt any religion, we just want our
religion to be left alone,'' Porush said. ``We will not let them do
their dangerous missionary work here.''

   China opened an international exhibit of its
arsenal Tuesday complete with scale models and videos of the weapons
in action.
   The China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp., one of the
country's largest arms manufacturers, said it was putting six new
missiles on the market during the four-day Asian Defense Technology
Exposition, or Asiandex 88.
   They included several medium-range coastal defense missiles
intended to replace the Silkworm, which Vice President Shen Rengui
said used outdated technology and was being phased out.
   The Silkworm became China's most famous missile when Iran used
one in October 1987 to attack a Kuwaiti oil tanker flying the
American flag. China denied selling Silkworms to Iran and said it
did not know where Iran bought them.
   But Western experts said the new missiles and other weapons shown
at Asiandex already were being promoted to potential buyers, and
that the show contained no surprises.
   The exhibit demonstrated China's determination to increase its
arms sales despite criticism from the United States and other
Western countries that Chinese sales to primarily Third World
countries are destabilizing.
   China does not release figures on its arms sales, but the U.S.
government estimates China sold sold about $2 billion in weapons
abroad in 1987. It is the fourth-largest weapons seller to the Third
World after the Soviet Union, United States and France.
   China began taking part in international arms shows in 1984, and
held the first show of its own, Asiandex 86, two years ago.
   Nearly 100 foreign companies also had booths at the exhibition,
including the U.S. companies Boeing and Lockheed, Britain's Marconi
Group, Hungary's Technika Foreign Trading Co. and Chile's Cardoen.
Arms manufacturers from France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands
and other countries also were represented.
   One Western manufacturer said his company attended not in hopes
of making an immediate sale to China, but simply to keep up contacts
with the Chinese military. ``We've talked with them and they sent a
team to tour our plant at one point but _ nothing,'' he said.
   A Western source noted China has been uninterested in importing
large quantities of weapons.
   ``What they want is joint ventures, so they can learn the
technology and reverse-engineer and make it themselves,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Many of China's current weapons were derived in this way from
1950s Soviet models. In recent years China has entered into
agreements with Western companies to use their advanced technology
to upgrade its obsolete arsenal.
   Aeritalia of Italy supplied avionics technology for China's new
A5-M fighter plane, which recently had a successful test flight.
U.S. and British companies also have cooperated in updating Chinese
tanks and planes.
   China's strategy has been to use arms exports to subsidize
improvements in its domestic arsenal that it could not otherwise
afford. Its biggest market has been the Middle East, where it has
sold to both Iran and Iraq during their 8-year-old border war.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher, with at least four more years
ahead of her as prime minister, flew to Washington today to bid
goodbye to President Reagan and welcome President-elect George Bush
to the ranks of Western leaders.
   The prime minister left Heathrow Airport under tight security at
4 p.m. (11 a.m. EST), bound for Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington.
   Thatcher, who has marched in ideological step with Reagan since
he took office eight years ago, thanked him in a speech Monday for
what she said has been his main contribution to the West:
   ``Let us above all thank President Reagan for ending the West's
retreat from world responsibility, for restoring the pride and
leadership of the U.S., and for giving the West back its confidence
_ confidence not only in the success of free enterprise but also in
the values which guide our societies.'' Speaking at the annual Lord
Mayor's banquet in the City, London's financial area, she added:
``He has left America stronger, prouder, greater than ever before
and we thank him for it.''
   In the speech, Mrs. Thatcher also announced that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would visit Britain Dec. 12-14. Around Dec. 7,
Gorbachev is to visit the United Nations as well as meet with Reagan
for a fifth time and possibly see Bush, U.S. officials say.
   Mrs. Thatcher also welcomed Bush as ``a worthy successor'' to
Reagan. ``We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of
unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all
that is best in America,'' she said.
   Reagan said Monday that Mrs. Thatcher was the best statesman he
had met. Asked by a group of schoolchildren at the White House if he
thought the United States would ever have a woman president, he
said: ``I am certainly not against (a female president)...
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she has done a remarkable job for England.''
   Reagan came to office 1{ years after Mrs. Thatcher, and together
they have reinvigorated the long-standing special relationship
between the two countries.
   But while Reagan must step down, Mrs. Thatcher, 63, who is now
the West's longest serving leader, faces no such constraints.
   Her present tenure lasts another four years, and she has said she
will seek a fourth term in the 1990s. If the Conservative Party
leader wins that means she will be working with Bush right up to
1992.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher have shared a deep anti-Communist
ideology, distaste for welfarism, faith in free markets and belief
in negotiating from strength.
   They have helped each other at critical movements, sometimes at
great political risk _ Reagan by approving arms supplies and
intelligence to Britain in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina,
and Mrs. Thatcher by letting Reagan use U.S. bombers based in
Britain to bomb Libya in 1986.
   Mrs. Thatcher played a role in the Reagan-Gorbachev thaw. She was
the first major Western leader to visit Gorbachev after he came to
power in 1985. And on his way to Washington to sign the
arms-reduction treaty in 1987, Gorbachev stopped in Britain for
talks with the prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher arrives in Washington tonight, and will have talks
with Reagan on Wednesday, followed by a state dinner. On Thursday,
she will have talks with Bush, returning home early Friday.

<HEAD>Culture Minister Calls For Review of Dissident Policy, Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Slovak culture minister on
Tuesday called on leaders to correct mistakes that have pushed
people away from the Communist Party and into the embrace of
independent groups and churches.
   Miroslav Valek's unusually critical analysis of Czechoslovakia's
political situation was published by the Communist Party daily
newspaper Rude Pravo.
   He said the country's leaders must right mistakes made since the
1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed.
   ``We must analyze the past period properly and expose errors and
mistakes not only in the economy but also in politics,'' he wrote.
   ``On the one hand, there were anti-socialist and ... unrealistic
tendencies. On the other hand, there were rational political and
economic pressures, the need for reform, and those should have been
seen and differentiated.''
   Moscow installed the conservative Czechoslovak leadership after
the Aug. 21-22, 1968, invasion that crushed the reforms of Alexander
Dubcek. While embracing some economic reforms, it has been reluctant
to follow Moscow's example in initiating wide-ranging political
reforms.
   The Slovak official said the purge of 500,000 people from the
Communist Party was perceived, especially by the young, ``as an
all-embracing condemnation of opposition, as a political trauma.''
   This ``trauma ... hasn't passed yet and is not going to pass all
by itself.''
   An analysis of the past was imperative, he said, to regain
people's confidence.
   ``It is necessary to analyze continuously the cause of the birth
and development of Charter 77'' human rights group, young people's
apathy toward the official Communist Youth Union and increasing
interest in religion, the minister said.
   ``All these are facts to which realistic policy can neither
surrender nor close its eyes naively,'' Valek wrote.
   The leadership's apparent unwillingness to re-evaluate the spirit
of 1968 was highlighted by the police quelling of an Aug. 21
demonstration to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion and
official articles condemning Dubcek and his reforms.
   Last week, up to 25 activists were taken into preventive custody
in Prague to stop a symposium to examine Czechoslovakia's role in
history.
   On Tuesday, the United States strongly denounced Czechoslovak
authorities for thwarting the symposium and served notice it will
irrevocably block consensus on any Helsinki follow-up meeting in
Prague.
   In a statement to the Vienna meeting of the 35-nation Helsinki
review conference on human rights, U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann
said, ``The contempt they (Prague authorities) displayed for the
rights of Czechoslovak citizens amounts to contempt for the Vienna
meeting and the ... process in which Czechoslovakia pledged to
respect those rights.''
   He said Czechoslovkia's poor human rights record disqualified it
from hosting a follow-up meeting. ``A prospective host should have a
credible record on the subject to be discussed,'' he said.
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry called in Czechoslovak Ambassador
Frantisek Chlad to condemn the crackdown as a ``violation of the
fundamental principles of human rights,'' a ministry spokesman said
Tuesday.
   ``The government also stated that it deplores the attitude of the
police against foreign guests,'' said the spokesman, referring to
reports that one of a dozen Western participants in the symposium,
former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, was manhandled by
Czechoslovak police Friday.

   National Geographic magazine is producing a
publishing first in its December magazine, an all-holographic cover.
   ``Never before has any magazine published an entirely holographic
cover; no ink was used on the front, spine or back,'' the magazine
reported.
   It's the third time, however, the magazine has included a
hologram _ a three-dimensional photo _ on its cover. It published an
eagle in March 1984 and the skull of the prehistoric Taung Child in
November 1985.
   More than 10 million copies of the magazine will be issued with
the gold-tinted cover. National Geographic spokeswoman Barbara
Moffet said Tuesday the cost of the special effect has not been
tallied.
   The cover of the magazine includes the traditional ``National
Geographic'' title plus a photo of the globe being shattered.
   The breaking Earth was chosen to symbolize the theme of the
December issue of the magazine, which focuses on the fragile nature
of the planet with articles the imperiled rain forest, nature
conservation, threats to the arctic and population growth, among
others.
   The photo of the breaking Earth was made by shattering a Steuben
crystal globe, the magazine reported, using a green laser light to
produce the image.
   The three-dimensional image of the hologram is produced by
printing the photo with microscopic ridges _ 20,000 per inch, on
rolls of clear plastic.
   The back cover of the magazine features an advertisement for
McDonald's restaurants, with a holographic photo of one of the
chain's restaurants.

   A mother reunited with her premature
baby says she forgives the woman who allegedly posed as a nurse and
took the 3-day-old boy from her arms at a hospital two weeks ago.
   ``If she took the baby because of a loss in her own life, I hope
that she will have the opportunity to get some help,'' 32-year-old
Annette Thomas-Jones said Monday, minutes after police returned her
son.
   ``I forgive her.''
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones and her husband, Willie Jones, 39, showed off
the child, Christopher Michael Jones, at a news conference at
Doctors Hospital, where the baby was kidnapped Nov 1. Today, they
took the child home.
   Police retrieved the infant Monday and arrested Acqunetta Rushon
Smith, 32, at Ms. Smith's Hot Springs home, 50 miles away, following
a tip to a hot line. The child was well cared for, authorities said.
   Ms. Smith, an unemployed nurse's aide with four children, was
charged with kidnapping. She pleaded innocent at arraignment today
in Little Rock Municipal Court, and a preliminary hearing was set
for next Tuesday.
   As she left the hospital today, Mrs. Thomas-Jones said that when
she got home with her baby, the youngster would be put to bed for a
nap first.
   ``Then his sisters will probably say, `Mamma, we're hungry,' so
we'll get something for them,'' she said. ``We'll just start our
lives with baby Christopher.'' The couple have two older daughters.
   As the family arrived at the house, a man brought a plant that
included blue ribbons and a foil balloon on a stick. On the balloon
was the word, ``Congratulations.''
   The infant was wearing a tiny white T-shirt reading ``Welcome
Home'' at the news conference Monday. He appeared no worse for the
ordeal.
   ``The baby obviously was well taken care of,'' said Terry
Jefferson, a pediatrician. He said Christopher weighed 5 pounds, 6
ounces Monday, up from 4 pounds when he was kidnapped.
   ``She took very good care of the baby,'' said Mrs. Thomas-Jones.
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones said the prosecution of the kidnapper would not
make the family feel any better, but that they would cooperate with
authorities.
   ``I wouldn't feel better, because I have Christopher,'' said Mrs.
Thomas-Jones, a secretary at the state teachers' union headquarters.
``She (Ms. Smith) needs help. ... (She should) just ask the Lord to
forgive her for what she's done.''
   The tip that led police and FBI agents to Ms. Jones came from ``a
concerned citizen'' who said the baby might be at the woman's home,
said Little Rock Detective Ronnie Smith.
   Detectives continued to question Ms. Smith late Monday but
released no details on a motive.
   A positive identification of the infant was made through a
footprint, said FBI agent Ron Wolfe.
   Applause broke out from a crowd of about two dozen neighbors and
reporters when Mrs. Thomas-Jones and her husband, a real estate
agent, emerged from their house on their way to the hospital to be
reunited with the infant Monday afternoon.
   ``Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, hallelujah!'' Mrs.
Thomas-Jones shouted.
   ``I just want to thank the media,'' she said, tears filling her
eyes and her voice breaking.
   Local broadcasts and newspapers carried repeated appeals by Mrs.
Thomas-Jones, her minister and others for information leading to the
baby's return. The reports noted that Christopher needed continued
medical attention because he was six weeks premature at birth Oct.
29.
   Three days after his birth, Mrs. Thomas-Jones handed the baby
over to a woman posing as a nurse who said she needed to weigh the
boy, authorities said.
   A couple who lives across the street from Ms. Smith, Andrew
Tucker and his wife, said their daughter, Barbara Ann Tucker, knew
Ms. Smith in high school and held the baby last week.
   They said Ms. Smith told their daughter she had the baby and was
released from the hospital the same day. Tucker said he didn't
believe the story because she didn't look like she had lost weight.
   Another neighbor, Stella Kidd, said Ms. Smith looked pregnant in
May, when she moved to the area. But she said she never saw a baby.
   On Monday, a banner at Doctors Hospital read ``Welcome Home,
Christopher'' in baby blue letters, and small baby blue ribbons were
handed out to employees and visitors.
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones said her son ``looks like $250 million wrapped
up _ not just a million, but $250 million. He looks fantastic. He
looks like his daddy.''
   When she first was reunited with Christopher, she said, ``I held
him and I looked at him and I checked his fingers out and his toes
out and his legs and his stomach and his head and everything's there.
   ``I feel relieved, joyful, thankful,'' she said. ``I knew the
Lord was going to bring Christopher home for us.''

   Firing chemical shells that caused
victims to vomit blood, Soviet and Afghan government soldiers
recaptured a key border post and road link with Pakistan from
anti-communist guerrillas, insurgents said.
   Mohammad Shuaib of the Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group said thousands
of government and Soviet troops were involved and that hundreds of
guerrillas died in the battle before it ended Sunday.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
denied the charge of chemical weapons use, saying neither Soviet nor
Afghan government forces have such weapons in Afghanistan.
   In a state radio broadcast, the Soviet-backed government in Kabul
said security forces had retaken the Torkham post on the
Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said 140 guerrillas were
killed and 150 injured at Torkham Monday. Large quantities of
weapons and ammunition were also captured, it said. It gave no other
details.
   In another development, Afghanistan today requested an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Security Council to stop Pakistan's arming of
anti-government rebels and warned it may be forced to use military
force in self-defense. The request was made in a letter from Abdul
Wakil, Afghanistan's foreign minister.
   Western diplomats on Monday confirmed the presence of Soviet
soldiers in the battle for the Torkham post and the highway linking
Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan to Pakistan.
   Diplomats said Soviet soldiers were flown in to join the
offensive, presumably from Kabul, the Afghan capital about 70 miles
to the west. They and most guerrilla informants spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Insurgents who reached Peshawar, about 30 miles inside Pakistan,
claimed Soviet and Afghan forces used chemical weapons. They said
explosive shells fired by artillery contained a chemical that caused
victims to blister and vomit blood.
   Moslem rebels began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978
and the Soviet Union sent military forces into Afghanistan in
December 1979. In April, the Soviets accepted a U.N.-mediated
agreement to withdraw their about 100,000 troops.
   About half the force has gone home, but the Soviets said last
week they were suspending the withdrawal and sending new weapons
into Afghanistan because of continuing guerrilla attacks. They
added, however, that they still intend to complete the pullout as
scheduled on Feb. 15.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas captured Torkham Nov. 2 and had
claimed they were closing in on Jalalabad.
   Both diplomats and rebels said Soviet commandos supported by
helicopter gunships moved out of Jalalabad on foot, moving along the
road to Torkham, according to insurgent sources.
   The official Afghan radio said high military officials visited
the post Monday.
   Insurgents and diplomats said the guerrillas retreated into
Pakistan, where about 3 million Afghan refugees live.
   Earlier this month, the government displayed SS-1 Scud missiles
in Kabul. Advanced MiG-27 ground-attack jets and sophisticated
helicopter gunships have been reported in action against the
guerrillas.
   Arrival of the new weapons prompted a guerrilla offensive along
the strategic Salang highway that links Kabul with the Soviet border
to the north.
   Ahmad Shah Masoud, Jamiat-e-Islami's commander in the Panjshir
Valley, claims to have closed the highway but Shuaib of the Jamiat
said reports from units along the road were sporadic and there was
no recent confirmation that it remained closed.
   The Salang highway is the only overland route to the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle was not invited
to the White House state dinner for British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, but ``it was not a slight in any way,'' a spokeswoman for
first lady Nancy Reagan said Tuesday.
   Press Secretary Elaine Crispen said invitations to the state
dinner, to be held Wednesday night, were mailed about a month ago _
well before the election _ and that no exceptions to invitation
policy were made so that the Indiana senator could attend.
   Jeff Nesbitt, a spokesman for Quayle, could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   Mrs. Crispen said suggested invitations to state dinners are
forwarded to White House social secretary Linda Faulkner from
several quarters, including the State Department, the National
Security Council, the White House Office of Public Liaison and the
White House Office of Congressional Liaison.
   At a typical state dinner, she said, there will be three members
of the Senate and three members of the House among the 126 guests,
along with various diplomats, business executives, artists,
scientists, musicians and others.
   Mrs. Crispen said Quayle had been to a state dinner in 1982, but
that under the rotation of three senators per dinner _ there are
nine such events a year _ his next invitation would still have been
a long time coming.
   But as vice president, she said, ``he will be coming to more
state dinners than he can imagine.''

<HEAD>Court Bans Controversial Film in Greek Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Tuesday banned ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' from movie theaters in the capital where
Nikos Kazantzakis, who wrote the book on which the film is based,
lived for more than 20 years.
   The ban came after eight Orthodox Christian organizations claimed
the movie insulted religious feeling and defamed the head of the
church, said a court spokesman.
   The court's injuction orders theaters and the film's distributor,
United International Pictures, to suspend screenings or face a fine
of nearly $700 for each violation, the spokesman said.
   Last week, a court in the northern city of Salonica banned the
film before its first showing.
   Both injuctions will be appealed in higher court. The Salonica
appeal hearing is set for Nov. 24. No date was set for the Athens
hearing.
   ``We were surprised by the decision. Of course we will fight
these kinds of decisions,'' said Nick Kalogerakis, a spokesman for
the distributor.
   The Martin Scorsese film, which opened in Athens on Oct. 23, is
being shown at four movie theaters in the capital area.
   At its first screening, hundreds of Greek Orthodox priests and
faithful slashed movie screens and clashed with riot police.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which has been called
``horrifyingly vulgar'' by the Orthodox Church of Greece, also has
been denounced by other church groups in Europe and the United
States.
   Kazantzakis, who died in 1957, was threatened with
excommunication by the Orthodox Church when the book was published
in 1954.
   Kazantzakis studied law at Athens university from 1902 to 1906.
He lived in the Greek capital for more than 20 years and served in
Athens as a minister without portfolio shortly after World War II.
His first work was published in Athens in 1906.

   Conductors struck the Metro-North Commuter
Railroad this morning in a dispute over pensions, stranding 95,000
suburbanites, but a federal judge ordered the strikers back to work
and the union said it would comply.
   It was the second surprise strike in as many months at the
nation's second-largest commuter railroad, which serves the city's
northern suburbs extending into Connecticut.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet signed a temporary restraining
order at 10:15 a.m. and ordered the United Transportation Union to
post a bond of $30,000. The railroad is seeking $1 million in
damages from the union.
   ``I will not defy it. I'm a law-abiding citizen,'' said James
Phelan, the union chief. The UTU represents 770 Metro-North
conductors.
   After the strike broke out, all trains were canceled and the
entire railroad was shut down as other unions honored the picket
lines set up by the conductors. The dispute also disrupted some
Amtrak service.
   Metro-North President Peter Stangl, who had called the strike
``outrageous and illegal,'' said that the trains should begin
running again at midafteroon. ``We'll have an evening rush (hour),''
he said.
   Phelan said the union struck because of a dispute about the
calculation of pension contributions and the timing of deposits.
``On such a sensitive issue as pension, strict compliance is
essential,'' he said.
   But the railroad insisted it was in compliance.
   At normally bustling Grand Central Terminal, no trains were
arriving, ticket counters were closed and people hoping to leave New
York City stood staring at the cancellation notices on the schedule
board.
   ``I've come all the way from Long Island,'' said Grace Giusto,
who was supposed to attend a 9 a.m. business meeting in north
suburban White Plains. ``I'm really stranded.''
   On the morning of Sept. 9, 780 Metro-North track workers from the
Teamsters union staged a surprise strike, but the railroad obtained
a court order within hours that ended the walkout. That strike was
prompted by the suspension of 37 employees for refusing to work
overtime, union officials said.

   Queen Elizabeth II expects to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev during his visit to Britain next month,
Buckingham Palace said Tuesday.
   No details of the meeting have been confirmed, a palace
spokeswoman said, but she noted the queen's meetings with world
leaders ``often take the form of a lunch.''
   The spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said there were no plans for a visit by the queen to Moscow.
If an invitation came, the queen would act on the advice of
government officials, who must approve all foreign travel by the
monarch, she said.
   No British sovereign has visited the Soviet Union since World War
I, when members of the Russian royal family, who were related to the
British monarchy, were killed by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, also will meet with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   British news reports said Gorbachev would arrive in Britain on
Dec. 12 and meet with Mrs. Thatcher on Dec. 13 at Chequers, her
official country residence, before leaving early Dec. 14.

   Space shuttle managers began a
two-day flight readiness review Tuesday to set a date for launching
Atlantis on a classified military mission with a crew of five
astronauts.
   The shuttle's processing director, Conrad Nagel, said Monday the
launch target was Nov. 30, but that Dec. 1 was a more likely date
because of a few outstanding technical problems.
   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, who directs NASA's shuttle program, is
expected to announce a launch date Wednesday afternoon after the
managers review the status of the orbiter, the payload, the global
tracking network and other elements needed to support the mission.
   Most details about the flight are not being made public because
Atlantis will be carrying a secret Defense Department payload which
sources say is a sophisticated intelligence-gathering satellite.
   The launch will be the second for the shuttle since the
Challenger explosion in January 1986 that killed its crew of seven.
Flights resumed last Sept. 29 with the successful launch of
Discovery and a five-man crew on a four-day orbital trip.

<TEXT>
   An osteopath faces a $125,000 lawsuit for
drawing a cartoon depiction of oral sex on a patient's chest,
despite his protest that it was just a joke between friends.
   Wayne Scherr, 35, of Spanaway, accused osteopath Scott Havsy of
Puyallup of battery, outrage, negligence, breach of contract and
breach of fiduciary duty. Scherr claimed the incident awakened
memories of having been molested as a teen-ager.
   A state Department of Licensing investigation of Havsy also is
pending, but Yvonne Braeme, program manager of the health therapies
unit, wouldn't say whether the probe was related to a complaint
Scherr filed with the Medical Society of Pierce County.
   The case concerned Scherr's visit to Havsy's office Feb. 24, 1987.
   A defense memorandum said the osteopath and patient had been
friends over the years and often told each other jokes.
   ``At the conclusion of the appointment and in the privacy of his
office, (Havsy) began the relating of a joke and (Scherr)
participated therein,'' the memo said. ``Subsequently, (Scherr) then
went out and publicly displayed his chest. (He) also went through
elaborate steps to preserve the drawing.
   ``(Scherr's) actions were designated solely to exploit a joke
between friends by turning it into a lawsuit.''
   Neither Havsy nor his attorney returned phone calls, and Scherr
refused to comment.
   In a deposition taken this year, however, Scherr gave a different
account, saying he told Havsy he was in pain.
   ```I've been in a lot of pain all weekend. Something has to be
done. I'm experiencing a lot more pain than I normally have,'''
Scherr recounted in the deposition.
   Havsy then held Scherr down and drew on his chest while laughing,
the document says.
   Scherr said he showed the cartoon to two of Havsy's employees,
then called several attorneys and talked to his father, who
persuaded him to have a picture of it taken at a photography studio.
His father also traced the design before Scherr washed it off his
chest the day it was drawn, he said.
   The case was set for trial March 20 in Pierce County Superior
Court.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ More than 250 people in three days
called a computer data base set up to help veterans find friends
from the Vietnam War, the program's coordinator said.
   ``The answering service is threatening to quit because they're
getting too many calls,'' John Sepcoski Jr. said Monday.
   The increased calls to the Find-A-Vet program followed an
Associated Press story that ran nationally in newspapers Friday and
Saturday. Pennsylvania television stations also have done stories on
the program.
   Find-A-Vet has more than 2,000 names in the data base and can
also search the Veterans of the Vietnam War's membership rolls for
more than 32,000 names, said Michael Milne, executive director of
the Wilkes-Barre-based organization.
   Milne said many veterans forgot to swap names and addresses when
they were rotated out of Vietnam.
   Find-A-Vet allows vets to search the data base, even if all they
remember is a military unit or a nickname. Sepcoski sends the person
making the request a list of people who fit the description. A $1
donation is asked.

<HEAD>No Indictments in Huerta Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A grand jury has decided against issuing
indictments in the beating of farm worker leader Dolores Huerta,
whose spleen was removed after she was injured during a
demonstration in September.
   Although the panel found the injuries were not the result of
criminal wrongdoing by police or protesters, it recommended
extensive changes in police crowd-control methods, grand jury
foreman Luther Jones said Monday.
   ``We feel that by better monitoring of the crowd, the whole
situation could have been avoided,'' Jones said of the Sept. 14
incident that took place outside the St. Francis Hotel where George
Bush was campaigning.
   Huerta, 58, suffered two broken ribs in addition to the ruptured
spleen and was in the hospital for almost two weeks.
   The jury, Jones said, found that police policies ``were
inadequate to deal with what happend.''
   Huerta was passing out leaflets about a grape boycott when
officers ordered a crowd of nearly 1,000 people to disperse. Union
workers claimed the 120-pound woman was struck and jabbed with a
police baton.
   Jones said the jury's findings were based on testimony from
witnesses, including Huerta, and a review of police and television
videotapes.
   ``It is disappointing that there is apparently going to be no
serious action on the part of the city to discipline the officer
responsible for nearly killing Dolores Huerta,'' said her attorney,
Dianna Lyons.

   A planetarium whose original projector made
viewers dizzy and ill is opening nine years late with a 68-foot-wide
dome and a projection system intended to simulate space travel.
   The Arnim D. Hummel Planetarium officially opens Wednesday at
Eastern Kentucky University.
   ``I always thought it would actually happen, but I didn't think
it would take as long as it did,'' said Jack Fletcher, who was hired
11 years ago as planetarium director.
   Equipment installed in 1979 projected images so blurred that
people who watched test programs became dizzy and nauseated.
   The university sued the manufacturer of the projection equipment,
Spitz Inc. of Chadds Ford, Pa. Two years ago, Spitz agreed out of
court to replace the original equipment with a new system called
Space Voyager.
   In most planetariums, the same projector produces images of the
stars and planets. That makes the planetariums ``Earth-bound,'' only
able to project the sky as it appears from the Earth.
   With the Space Voyager system, the projectors are separated,
making possible the illusion of space travel.
   The star-ball projector is 4 feet in diameter and projects 10,164
stars. Each star has a separate lens. There are five planet
projectors and a sun projector. Also part of the system are a
multiimage slide projector and a six-channel stereo sound system.
   The system is the third of its kind in the world. The others are
in Paris and Singapore.
   The planetarium is named for the first chairman of Eastern's
physics department. During World War II, Hummel was instrumental in
developing a radar-activated fuse.
   The university's planetarium is the 10th-largest of the 985
planetariums in the United States. The largest is the Reuben H.
Fleet Space Theater in San Diego, which has a 75-foot dome.

   The Reagan administration today rejected a PLO
proclamation of an independent Palestinian state, asserting that the
Arab-Israeli conflict must be settled by negotiations and not by
unilateral acts.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said the status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip ``cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side
but only through a process of negotiations.''
   ``A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood is such a
unilateral act,'' Redman said. A similar statement was issued by
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said that despite U.S. opposition to the proclamation
of an independent Palestinian state, the administration sees
``positive elements'' to the Palestine National Council meeting in
Algiers, most notably its support for U.N. Security Council
resolutions 224 and 338. These lay the groundwork for a
comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Redman said the administration has not yet seen the final text of
the resolution approved by the PNC but promised it would receive
serious study.
   ``Our objective is a comprehensive peace,'' Redman said. ``Direct
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process.
Palestinian partiicpation is required at every stage of
negotiations. All participants in the negotiations must renounce
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted
international basis of U.N. Security Council resolutions 224 and
338.''
   Fitzwater said it ``still is not clear just how specific'' the
Palestine Liberation Organization has been about extending an olive
branch to Israel by implicitly recognizing the Jewish state's right
to exist.
   At the Algiers meeting, the PLO's quasi-legislature voted to
accept Security Council Resolution 242, which established the
principle that all states in the region _ including Israel _ are
entitled to exist in peace.
   President Reagan said Monday that PLO acceptance of the
resolution, which long has been the cornerstone of international
efforts to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East, ``would be
some progress.''
   But Reagan said ``there are other problems that remain to be
solved'' before there is a breakthrough in the PLO's stance toward
Israel. He was not more specific.
   Reagan spoke before the Palestine National Council proclaimed a
new independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip with Jerusalem as its capital.
   Apart from accepting the 1967 U.N. resolution, U.S. policy
requires the PLO to renounce terrorism and to nullify the provision
in its covenant calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.
   Otherwise, U.S. officials are not supposed to negotiate with the
PLO or support its participation in any Mideast peace talks.
   The State Department on Monday released a ``fact sheet''
detailing attacks on Israelis attributed to the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   The group, which has its headquarters in Syria, is believed to
have opposed approval of the U.N. resolution in Algiers.
   ``Apparently there has been an indication they're willing to
abide by 242,'' Reagan said of the Palestine National Council's
approach to the U.N. resolution, adopted after the 1967 Mideast war,
that implicitly recognized Israel's right to live within secure
borders.
   ``I hope that is true because that would be some progress,'' he
said during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with Andrei
A. Sakharov, the Soviet human rights activist.
   The resolution, which was adopted by the Security Council again
in 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur war, also calls on Israel to
relinquish territory lost by the Arabs in 1967.
   Asked Monday whether an international peace conference on the
Middle East could represent a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute,
Reagan replied, ``I'm still not sure that that is the answer.''
   Earlier this year, the United States cautiously supported efforts
to arrange such a peace conference. However, officials stressed that
any settlement depended on direct negotiations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.

<HEAD>Study Says Emergency Heart Procedure Unnecessary After Heart
Attacks</HEAD>

   The expensive practice of using balloon
catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart
attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary
and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
   The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive
clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the
common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
   Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean
that most heart attack patients can be treated in community
hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.
   The study also has an important financial message. Its authors
estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart
attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704
million.
   ``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in
modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the
University of Washington, Seattle.
   The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction
Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
   The first phase of the study showed that giving people a
clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,
immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances
of survival.
   The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American
Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better
still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after
giving TPA.
   At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly
assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their
heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might
benefit. Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure,
which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart
arteries to squeeze them open.
   A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA. But they were not
considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or
abnormal exercise tests during their recovery.
   After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had
died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those
in the comparison group.
   A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.
About 93 percent of both groups were still alive.
   ``There does not appear to be any additional benefit from
angioplasty,'' Braunwald said.
   Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented,
``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of
health care delivery.''
   While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart
attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs
where angioplasty is performed.
   If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves
survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would
need to be established and more doctors trained to give the
procedure.
   ``The watch word is watchful waiting'' to see if patients need
angioplasty. ``This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be
treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care
centers if angioplasty is needed,'' said Dr. Howard Morgan,
immediate past president of the heart association.
   Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the
heart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve
these clots before the muscle dies. To be effective, the drugs must
be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack
symptoms.
   Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims
are considered to be candidates for the drugs. Many people delay
going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, the
treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery
or a history of strokes.
   Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with
clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks. The
latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of
angioplasty.

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Freeze on World Farm Price Supports, Subsidies in Two
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States wants to reform world
agricultural trade, beginning with a freeze on all farm price
supports, subsidies and trade barriers in the next two years, a
White House report said Tuesday.
   The proposal, dated Nov. 7, was made as part of the current
Uruguay Round of trade talks under the 96-nation General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. Those talks began in Uruguay in 1986 and are
scheduled to conclude in 1990.
   Earlier, the United States proposed the elimination of farm
subsidies and other GATT reforms by the year 2000 but has been
criticized heatedly by the European Economic Community and Japan.
   Under the latest proposal, which was released by the office of
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, the United States would
agree to the freeze in 1989 and 1990 in return for a commitment from
other countries to ``eliminate all measures that directly or
indirectly affect trade'' and to write new rules that are based on
free trade principles.
   The new U.S. plan is scheduled to be taken up during a mid-term
negotiating session beginning Dec. 5 in Montreal.
   According to the proposal, the United States also is seeking ``a
commitment to undertake specific reforms that would bring all
agricultural trade into compliance'' with new GATT rules within a
period of time agreed upon by the negotiators.
   No deadline, such as the year 2000 in the previous U.S. plan, was
mentioned in the new version.
   Yeutter said in October that a short-term or interim agreement
for 1989 and 1990 would be desirable for all of the GATT countries
and get the reform process in motion. But Yeutter added that the
United States ``is not about to embark on this proposition unless we
also receive a satisfactory commitment to long-term reform.''
   In seeking the full liberlization of agricultural trade, the U.S.
proposal called upon trade ministers meeting in Montreal next month
to undertake ``fundamental policy reforms, within an agreed upon
period of time, that would bring all countries into compliance''
with free-trade principles.
   Those principles, the proposal said, include the elimination of
``all market access barriers and thereby provide treatment for
imports no less favorable than the treatment accorded domestic
commodities and products.''
   Further, it said, the objective would be ``to eliminate all
direct and indirect subsidies that directly or indirectly affect
trade.''
   However, the U.S. proposal would allow some exemptions of
policies that do not affect trade, including:
   _Direct income of other payments to farmers that are unrelated to
production and marketing, including those that provide a safety net
against natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances.
   _Bona fide foreign and domestic food aid programs.
   According to the U.S. plan, once the GATT trade ministers agree
to the proposed reforms, the freeze on agricultural ``support,
subsidies and protection'' could be worked out for 1989 and 1990.
   The freeze would entail surveillance to ensure compliance by each
country. Also, GATT members would pledge ``not to introduce or
undertake any new measures nor any other measures that would
circumvent the objectives of the freeze.''

<TEXT>
   South Florida's Latin community is reporting a sharp
increase in anti-Hispanic incidents since the overwhelming passage
last week of the official English amendment.
   Amendment 11, which makes English the official language of
Florida but leaves implementation to the Legislature, received an 84
percent ``yes'' vote in the Nov. 8 statewide election .
   Since the election, a supermarket employee was suspended for
speaking Spanish to another employee, the mayor of Coral Gables was
quoted as making derogatory remarks about his Hispanic opponent and
children in a West Palm Beach high school complained they were
forbidden to speak Spanish in school.
   ``What has happened is that people have taken the law into their
own hands and are enforcing it as they see fit,'' Osvaldo Soto,
president of the Spanish American League Against Discrimination,
said Monday. ``I knew Amendment 11 would bring chaos to Miami.''
   Soto said his organization has received calls from dozens of
people saying some stores refused to help Spanish-speaking customers.
   Supporters of the initiative say it does only what it is supposed
to do. They believe the Legislature will implement the law despite
complaints from Hispanics and the opposition of most state
politicians, including Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Miami's Cuban community has interpreted the official English vote
as a direct slap in the face. One Spanish radio station mockingly
insisted everyone on a popular talk show speak English the day after
the election, hanging up on Spanish-speakers who called in to
complain about the new law.
   Jose Uzal, who led the anti-Amendment 11 drive in Palm Beach
County, said many supporters there were open about their reasons for
favoring the measure.
   In a Monday talk show on an English-language station, Uzal said,
``callers were telling me this was certainly an anti-Hispanic
amendment, and that's why they voted for it.''
   Two days after the election, in the most highly publicized
incident blamed on the ballot measure, a supermarket manager in
Coral Gables suspended a cashier for speaking Spanish to another
employee. Store administrators later apologized for the incident;
the manager is being transferred.
   Over the weekend, Coral Gables Mayor George Corrigan was quoted
as saying he was more qualified than his opponent, city Commissioner
Raul Valdes Fauli, because his rival is a Latin who likes to sleep
late and misses commission meetings.
   On Monday, parents met in West Palm Beach met with officials at
Forest Hills High School when their children said an assistant
principal banned them from speaking Spanish in the hallways.
   Uzal said the assistant principal, May Gamble, told him she
prohibited the language because students had been using profanity.
   School principal Joe Picklesmier, however, told Uzal and the
parents that the school has no such policy.
   Mark LaPorta, coordinator of the Florida English campaign, called
such incidents meaningless, and blamed them on the media.
   ``That's a mistake and an over-reaction,'' said LaPorta. ``There
is great hypersensitivity now, and I think that will go down.''
   LaPorta is acutely aware of the hypersensitivity. During a
conciliatory post-election news conference aimed at calming fears
about the amendment, his own supporters interrupted him, grabbed his
microphone and called him a traitor when he said Dade County's
anti-bilingual ordinance could be scrapped under the new law.

   Attorneys for singer Wayne Newton and NBC-TV
returned to federal court to argue over the scope of a new trial in
Newton's libel suit against the network.
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, urged U.S. District Judge Myron
D. Crocker on Monday to limit the new trial to damages only, while
NBC's lawyers argued for a complete rerun of the original trial won
by Newton.
   Floyd Abrams, NBC's lead lawyer, said the jury that gave Newton a
record $19.2 libel verdict in 1986 failed to pinpoint a reason for
its action and that a new jury should hear the case.
   Galane, however, contended the issue of liability was decided
fairly in the original trial, when the jury ruled that Newton was
defamed by NBC during broadcasts in 1980 and 1981 that linked the
singer to organized crime figures.
   Crocker, who presided over the first trial, reduced the initial
jury award to $5.3 million last year and gave Newton the option of
accepting the smaller award or going back to court. Newton rejected
the smaller award.
   Crocker took Monday's arguments under submission. He has
scheduled the new trial for May in Los Angeles.
   Newton was in court Monday, flanked by his girlfriend, aides and
bodyguards.
   He sued NBC over three broadcasts in which NBC reported that
sources said Newton had gone to a reputed organized crime figure for
help with a problem. Newton testified at the 1986 trial that he was
seeking help in stopping death threats against his daughter.
   Newton contended the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.

   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey has shed 67 pounds in
four months and fulfilled a desire to fit into size 10 jeans with a
liquid protein diet, plus jogging and counseling, she told her 20
million viewers Tuesday.
   Winfrey, 34, said her inspiration came from a friend's husband,
who lost 75 pounds in 12 weeks. She said she hasn't eaten any solid
food since July 7 _ with one notable exception.
   During a vacation to Hawaii with boyfriend Stedman Graham six
weeks into her diet, ``I became obsessed with having a cheeseburger.
I said if I don't have a cheeseburger, I'm going to die.''
   Winfrey said she ate the cheeseburger, then almost immediately
went out and ran a mile to burn off the extra calories.

<TEXT>
   Vowing there will be ``no honeymoon on the
issue of abortion'' for the Bush administration, leaders of
pro-choice and feminist groups on Tuesday outlined a plan of action
that will culminate in a march for women's rights next April.
   ``We are determined that not one woman in America wll die or be
maimed from a back-alley abortion because George Bush was elected
president of the United States,'' said Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women.
   ``Mr. Bush may intend to make abortion illegal again, but he has
to understand that if he tries, he will be awakening a `sleeping
giant''' _ the millions of women who have had abortions, both before
and after the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion, Yard said.
   ``There will be no honeymoon period,'' said Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority and a former
president of NOW. She said ``the election results indicate both
political parties continue to lock women and minorities out.''
   Smeal said politicians who ``talk family'' but vote against
pro-choice alternatives and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to
the Constitution are ``hypocrites.''
   Yard said the groups' activities will ``turn the spotlight'' on
members of Congress and state legislators who don't represent the
views of their constituents as indicated by recent polls showing a
majority of Americans support a woman's right to a safe, legal
abortion.
   NOW outlined plans that include:
   _Setting up phone banks immediately to urge supporters to flood
Bush, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Chief Justice William
Rehnquist with mailgrams and public opinion messages demanding that
the abortion-rights ruling, Roe vs. Wade, be left standing.
   _Conducting vigils and pickets directed at leaders and
institutions financing and organizing anti-abortion efforts such as
``Operation Rescue,'' in which hundreds of protesters nationwide
have been arrested.
   _Holding an ``Inaugural Watch'' designed to give the issue
visibility in Washington during the inaugural parade and other
related activities.
   _Forming a committee to help make RU-246, a French-developed
``morning after'' pill, and other contraceptions available in the
United States.
   _A nationwide effort to organize activities commemorating the
16th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision on Jan. 22.
   _Coordinating ``The March for Women's Equality'' on April 9 that
will enlarge an already-planned march to revitalize the movement for
the ERA.

<HEAD>Walesa Accepts Official Trade Unions Chief Offer for TV Debate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Tuesday
promptly agreed to a nationally televised debate on the issue of
union pluralism with the head of Poland's official trade union
alliance.
   Alfred Miodowicz, member of the ruling Politburo and chairman of
the OPZZ, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions, had challenged
Walesa to the debate in an interview in Tuesday's edition of the
Communist Party daily newspaper Trybuna Ludu.
   ``In connection with Alfred Miodowicz's proposal ... concerning a
public meeting, I state that I accept it,'' Walesa said Tuesday.
   Walesa said he had authorized Solidarity national spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz and historian Adam Michnik, a veteran adviser to
the banned union, to make the arrangements.
   Although all the parties involved seemed to agree on the idea of
holding the debate, it was unclear who would take the next step.
   ``All members of the government will be glad to sit in front of
their TV sets and listen to such a discussion,'' government
spokesman Jerzy Urban said at his weekly news conference.
   The developments appeared to catch senior television officials by
surprise.
   Jerzy Slabicki, deputy chairman of the state Radio and TV
Committee, said he knew nothing about the proposal, but did not
exclude the possibility that the debate would take place.
   ``If there is to be a round table in Poland, such things are not
out of the question,'' Slabicki said, referring to talks promised by
the authorities during the August strikes to discuss the future of
Solidarity. The talks are stalled over government objections to the
proposed participation of Michnik and Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron.
   Another broadcast official appeared excited about the possibility
of a TV encounter between Walesa and Miodowicz.
   ``It would be great. Two good partners would meet,'' said Marek
Tumanowicz, deputy news director for state television.
   ``It would be very exciting. If we announced for example that on
Friday after the news we were going to broadcast such a debate, I am
sure the streets would be totally empty.''
   Miodowicz has headed the official unions since they were set up
by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned Solidarity,
the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union.
   Solidarity and the OPZZ hold opposing views on the number and
organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop floor.
Solidarity supporters say more than one union should be allowed to
exist in each workplace because the OPZZ unions don't adequately
represent workers' interests.
   It would be Walesa's first appearance on state TV since 1983,
when Walesa challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski during a televised speech at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.
Rakowski became prime minister in September.
   Walesa said a public discussion Miodowicz was long overdue.
   ``I do want to talk about trade union pluralism, but without any
adjectives. But I've been asking for a public debate for seven
years. ... Please don't attribute this to Mr. Miodowiz. It's me who
has been asking for it.''
   Walesa on Tuesday told 3,000 workers in the Lenin Shipyard he
will support management plans to restructure the yard and he is
satisfied the plans will save most of its jobs.
   The government had announced that the shipyard, the birthplace of
Solidarity, would be liquidated beginning Dec. 1, but now concedes
it will take 1{ years to close it.
   The government has said the closure is needed for economic
reasons, but Solidarity has said there should have been greater
consultations with the workforce and the announcement was a veiled
attack on Solidarity.

   Pakistan's president told the nation
police and soldiers would be out in force Wednesday to prevent
anyone from creating ``an atmosphere of fear or danger'' during
National Assembly elections.
   In a televised address Tuesday night, Ghulam Ishaq Khan urged the
48 million voters to participate in Pakistan's first open election
for more than a decade and to accept the outcome peacefully.
   Ishaq Khan, who has served on an interim basis since President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was killed in a plane crash three months ago,
said his government had done its best to ensure a free and fair vote.
   A bomb killed a man Tuesday in Rawalpindi and police in the
northern city said another was found unexploded. No one claimed
responsibility and officials would not speculate about whether the
bombs were related to the election.
   Gen. Zia ruled by martial law for eight years after seizing power
in 1977 and did not allow political parties to run candidates in
elections held after that. About 30 parties have entered Wednesday's
races for parliament seats.
   Most are small or regional and the election is expected to be a
contest between Benazir Bhutto, populist leader of the Pakistan
People's Party founded by her father, and the nine-party
conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance involving many Zia
loyalists.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was the
man Zia overthrew in 1977. He was convicted of complicity in a
murder plot and hanged in 1979.
   Election officials delivered ballots, boxes and government stamps
Tuesday to about 33,500 polling stations. Voters must present
government-issued identity cards in order to cast ballots.
   Soldiers in armored vehicles and sandbagged bunkers stood guard
in Karachi and Hyderabad, southern cities where nearly 300 people
were killed in ethnic riots two months ago.
   Police and paramilitary forces checked cars for bombs and weapons.
   Of the 217 National Assembly seats at stake in the election, 207
will be filled by Moslems and 10 will go to members chosen by
non-Moslem voters. The other 20 seats are reserved for women and
will be filled later by vote of the assembly.
   Ishaq Khan will chose a member of the assembly, presumably the
leader of the strongest party, to become prime minister and form a
government.
   On Saturday, voters will elect the 483 members of Pakistan's four
provincial assemblies.
   Zia held national elections on a non-party basis in 1985 that
were boycotted by the Bhutto party and other opposition groups. Last
May, he dismissed Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo and dissolved
the National Assembly, alleging corruption and failure to implement
Islamic law.
   The general was killed Aug. 17, along with the U.S. ambassador
and 28 other people, in the crash of a military transport plane. An
initial report left open the possibility of sabotage but the cause
of the crash has not been determined.
   A 25-member international delegation sponsored by the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs, an affiliate of the
U.S. Democratic Party, is to monitor voting on an unofficial basis.
   A report from the institute after a delegation visited Pakistan
last month said a ``comprehensive framework for procedurally correct
elections has been devised.''

   The energy efficiency of the economy appears to
be slowly improving again after a year of stagnation, despite an
earlier forecast that it would worsen in the short term, the Energy
Department said Tuesday.
   According to the department's Energy Information Administration,
analysts have discovered major errors, namely significant
overstatements of natural gas use by American industry, behind the
previous projection.
   Correction of the natural gas error means the nation's energy
efficiency is actually improving, though more slowly than in the
past, the EIA said.
   The agency's ``Short-Term Energy Outlook'' publication in in July
projected a worsening of the ratio from 19,960 BTUs per dollar of
gross national product in 1987 (expressed in dollars of 1982 buying
power) to 20,180 in 1988, followed by a slight improvement to 20,050
in 1989.
   The October revision puts 1988 efficiency at 19,840 BTUs per
dollar, a gain of 0.6 percent, with 1989 efficiency projected at
19,590, a further gain of 1.3 percent.
   Many analysts pay close attention to how much energy the economy
uses to produce a dollar's worth of goods and services.
Environmentalists use that ratio as an indicator of how much damage
the environment might be subject to from economic activity;
policymakers take it as a gauge of the vulnerability of the economy
to future interruptions on oil imports.
   Last year was the first since 1976 the ratio had failed to
improve. Energy price increases of the late 1970s had set off a
global scramble to boost efficiency, and, in the United States, led
to average annual rate of improvement of about 1.1 percent in the
1970s and 2.8 percent in the period 1980-1986.
   Oil prices, though, collapsed in 1986, leading many analysts to
conclude that companies stopped looking so hard for ways to use less
energy _ heat, electricity, petroleum or whatever _ in producing
their products.
   The EIA's October report said that 43 companies delivering
natural gas to industrial users ``have consistently misreported
their monthly industrial'' deliveries following introduction of a
new reporting form in January.
   ``This resulted in an overstatement of industrial consumption in
the first six months of 1988 of 0.5 trillion cubic feet,'' about 16
percent of now-estimated industrial consumption for the first half
of the year, the EIA said.
   Natural gas accounts for 23 percent of all forms of energy use.

<HEAD>Long-Lost Collection of Islamic Art Going on Display at Smithsonian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chance remark at a Parisian dinner party two
years ago led to the discovery of a long-lost collection of rare
Islamic art that will go on public display Sunday at the Smithsonian
Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.
   The collection assembled by Henri Vever, a turn-of-the-century
jeweler and art collector in Paris, is ``perhaps the most important
purchase in the history of the Smithsonian Institution,'' says
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams.
   The 500 items in Vever's collection of richly detailed paintings,
manuscripts, calligraphies and bookbindings from ancient Persia,
India and other major artistic centers of the Near East were bought
for $7 million.
   Smithsonian officials say their real worth is much, much more,
but that the collection is priceless in scope and quality.
   Drawn from the Vever collection are 150 items that will be
displayed at the Sackler, many of them for the first time anywhere,
from Sunday through April 30 in a show titled, ``A Jeweler's Eye:
Islamic Arts of the Book from the Vever Collection.''
   An hour-long ``Smithsonian World'' television special on Vever
and his collection will be broadcast on public TV stations next
March.
   Vever's collection includes almost all of the great classical
Persian texts, several important Arabic works and previously unknown
manuscripts and paintings from major artistic centers of the Near
East and India.
   The art works, some dating to the 11th century, reflect the
reverence for the written word in medieval Islam, stemming from the
holy scriptures of the prophet Muhammad known as the Koran. The
ruling elite built libraries of lavishly illuminated books and
manuscripts as symbols of their cultural sophistication.
   Vever's collection includes brilliant paintings in which the
pigments were ground from minerals, precious stones and metals, an
irresistible attraction to the jeweler and his contemporary, Henri
Cartier.
   Smithsonian officials say the only comparable collection in the
world is housed at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland.
   Vever's collection disappeared in the late 1930s during the
German occupation of France. Vever himself died in 1942, and the
whereabouts of his collection remained a mystery for nearly half a
century.
   Then, during a small dinner party in Paris in November 1984,
Laure Lowry of Williamstown, Mass., found herself seated next to
Francois Mautin, a wealthy, elderly sportsman and naturalized
American, who casually disclosed a momentous secret.
   Mautin said he was Vever's grandson and had inherited a major
collection of Islamic art, which was shipped intact from France to
New York City after World War II for safekeeping. There it remained,
stored in a vault known only to Mautin.
   Mrs. Lowry telephoned the news to her son, Glenn D. Lowry,
curator of Near Eastern art at the Freer Gallery of Art and the
yet-unbuilt Sackler gallery. Lowry was dumbfounded. He and Milo C.
Beach, now acting director of the Sackler, raced to Paris and won
Mautin's commitment to sell the collection to the Smithsonian.
   Lowry and Beach were the first scholars to see the collection, by
then moved to London, in 50 years. Among the well-preserved items
hidden in trunks and stacked against walls was a surprise _ 39 full
manuscripts previously unknown to scholars except for a handful that
were exhibited in London in 1931.
   The $7 million purchase was financed by various Smithsonian trust
and acquisition funds and private donors, including the late Dr.
Arthur M. Sackler, chief benefactor of the underground museum that
opened in September 1987.

   The woman sought in the deaths of seven
elderly people whose bodies were dug up from the yard of her rooming
house had told police she ``never killed anybody'' when she was
questioned last week, court documents say.
   Police who found the sixth and seventh bodies in shallow graves
Monday were expanding a search for bodies beyond the yard of the
rooming house. Digging resumed this morning, and officers also
searched the house.
   A warrant charging the boarding home's landlady, Dorothea
Montalvo Puente, 59, with one count of murder was issued late
Monday, said police Capt. Sam Somers. Police questioned her Friday,
the day the first body was discovered, and released her Saturday
morning for lack of evidence.
   ``Our first priority is to get her into custody,'' Burns said.
   According to sworn statements that police filed to obtain the
warrant, Puente twice denied killing her missing tenants, saying,
``I have never killed anybody.''
   But the affidavits said that one of her tenants, John Sharp,
handed a detective a note that said, ``She's making me lie.''
   Sharp later told police that one resident disappeared after he
had caused a drunken ruckus and ``Dorothea told him that she would
take him upstairs and make him better.'' About four days later,
police said, Sharp ``smelled a very strong odor of what he thought
was death in the kitchen area.'' Puente told him the stench was
caused by some faulty sewers.
   Investigators using shovels, steel probes and a tractor found the
two bodies wrapped in cloth or clothes in the yard of the two-story
Victorian house, said police Sgt. Bob Burns.
   The bodies found Monday, one unearthed in the front yard under a
flower bed and the other in the side yard under a shed, are
unidentified, like the five others.
   ``We'll continue to dig, and we won't stop digging until we've
dug up every square inch of this yard,'' Burns said.
   The arrest warrant charged Puente only with the slaying of Alvaro
Montoya, a mentally disabled transient who lived in the boarding
house. A search warrant for the house was also issued Monday.
   The Sacramento Bee reported today that police in Las Vegas had
been told Puente may be there.
   Investigators planned to excavate the rest of the yard at the
rooming house and comb an adjacent lot that Puente gardened when it
was vacant several years ago, Burns said.
   In 1982, Puente was convicted of drugging and robbing three
people in a bar, and sentenced to five years in prison, authorities
said. She was paroled after 2{ years, said Christine May, a state
Corrections Department spokeswoman.
   Police said they were uncertain about the cause of death or even
the sexes of the victims found Monday. No cause of death was
determined for the other victims, police said.
   The list of possible victims lengthened during the day.
   ``There are a lot more than eight names,'' Burns said, referring
to the original list of occupants supplied by a social worker.
``There's a big list of names. We've got detectives scurrying all
over this city.''
   Puente also ran a board-and-care home up to nine years ago about
eight blocks away. A separate team of investigators was interviewing
tenants at that address but there were no immediate plans to dig
there, Burns said.
   Police Lt. Joe Enloe said investigators believed the elderly
victims were killed for their Social Security checks. Payments
continued to be sent after the disappearances and someone else
cashed the checks, he said.
   Police went to the house after neighbors reported a friend had
been missing since August and a social worker said some of her
clients were missing.
   A social worker familiar with the rooming house described the
residents as elderly people on fixed incomes and with few relatives.
   The case worker, Peggy Nickerson, told police Puente came to her
in 1986, offering lodging. Nickerson said she took up Puente's
offer, and during the past two years referred 19 clients to Puente.
   ``She was the best the system had to offer,'' Nickerson said.
``She said she was a widow and had a big house, and she said it was
her time to give back to other people. ... That was her story and I
didn't have any reason to doubt her.''
   Puente's daughter, Linda Bloom, described her mother as someone
who had a ``terrible childhood'' and was raised in orphanages.
   Bloom, of South Pasadena, met her mother for the first time two
years ago after being put up for adoption herself at birth. She said
Puente was ``not animated at all'' and spoke in a monotone.
   On Sunday, police arrested John McCauley, a 59-year-old resident
of the boarding house, on suspicion of being an accessory after the
homicides. He was being held at the Sacramento County jail.
   Authorities believe McCauley assisted Puente after the slayings,
and that she may have arranged for others to dig the graves, police
said.

   PEAPACK-GLADSTONE, N.J. (AP) _ He may be a reigning monarch, but
the king of Morocco is just another gentleman farmer in the eyes of
the Somerset County tax board.
   The board ruled Monday that the evaluation on King Hassan II's
322-acre estate in the borough of Peapack & Gladstone be reduced
from $25.8 million to $7.3 million. That means the king's property
taxes for 1988 will be lowered from $204,591 to $57,764.
   County officials agreed with arguments by the king's
representatives that 225 acres of the property should be reassessed
as farmland because it is used to grow corn and hay, and breed
cattle. The evaluation on the remaining 97 acres also was reduced.
   ``He is using the land as a farm and has produced income from
that land,'' said tax board member Warren Nevins. ``He's produced
receipts. He's entitled to it just like anybody else.''
   Neighbors say they have never seen the king at the heavily wooded
estate and no one knows if he has ever visited it.

   Spiders give most people the willies, but
for a biology professor who collects the critters and whose students
call him ``Spiderman,'' having a spider named for him is an honor.
   ``I certainly wouldn't call it an attractive spider, but I'm very
flattered,'' said Allen Brady, a professor of biology at Hope
College for 22 years who has about 3,000 spiders in his office.
   One of Brady's former students discovered the previously unnamed
spider recently and has proposed that it be named Cyclocosmia
bradyi. The name and description will be submitted to the Journal of
Arachnology for publication.
   Robert Wolff, a 1974 Hope graduate who teaches biology at Trinity
Christian College in Palos Heights, Ill., found the spider in
collections of unidentified material from the Illinois Historical
Survey. He said it comes from Guerrero, Mexico.
   Brady calls himself ``a champion of spiders,'' saying most people
don't appreciate their insect-control capabilities.
   ``We really should appreciate spiders.''

   Some people have elaborate weddings in gardens or
banquet halls, and some have a ceremony with a gimmick _ such as
exchanging vows on horseback or while scuba diving.
   Johnny Hamblen and Kathryn Rogers, both 30, chose to tie the knot
simply, at lunchtime, while guests clad in work clothes leaned on
ladders, ate sandwiches and sipped sodas.
   Hamblen, a union carpenter in the midst of setting up for a
convention at the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown
Houston, snuck away from work shortly before noon Monday to trade
his jeans for a black suit with a boutonniere.
   Moments later, to the accompaniment of the sounds of saws and
hammers, several friends sang ``Here Comes the Bride'' while Ms.
Rogers walked through construction rubble to meet Hamblen at a
makeshift altar.
   Hamblen said it was the only way he could fit a wedding into his
schedule.
   ``He has to go back to work this afternoon,'' his new wife
explained.

<TEXT>
   A new electronic toll system that will ``read'' a
special automobile tag may help motorists whiz by toll booths, under
an experiment planned by two New York-area authorities.
   The number of times a vehicle goes through the toll would be
recorded by computer and a monthly bill charged to a credit card.
   The new system, called automatic vehicle identification or AVI,
uses a radio frequency beam transmitter mounted in each lane that
will read a unique serial number up to 20 digits from a tag mounted
on each vehicle.
   A similar system now being experimented with in Dallas is working
well, officials there said.
   The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority hopes to experiment
with the new system at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge _ a span between
Staten Island and Brooklyn that carries about 58 million vehicles a
year _ beginning early next year, Martin Gottlieb, the TBTA's
project manager for AVI, said Monday.
   However, the experiment, which could cost up to $1.4 million,
must first be approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
the TBTA's parent agency.
   If approved, tags would be fitted on vehicles belonging to some
trucking companies as well as vehicles belonging to TBTA employees
and Transit Authority buses that use the bridge, according to TBTA
spokeswoman Catherine Sweeney.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is
experimenting with a similar system for buses at the Lincoln Tunnel,
plans to use the same trucking companies for its experiment at the
Goethals Bridge, according to Armando Arrastia, a Port Authority
spokesman. The Goethals Bridge connects Staten Island and New Jersey.
   In addition, he said, the New Jersey Turnpike, the New Jersey
State Highway Authority and the New York State Thruway Authority are
all committed to using the same AVI system.
   The decision to use the Verrazano-Narrows and Goethals bridges
was made because ``a lot of the traffic would be the same,'' Sweeney
said. Many long-distance truckers cross Staten Island to avoid
Manhattan.
   ``The speed of proccessing at the toll booths is the main
advantage'' of the system, Gottlieb said. ``It will reduce the need
to handle cash, tickets and tokens.''
   The New York and New Jersey transportation officials are
optimistic about the system because of good results from a similar
experiment in Dallas by the Texas Turnpike Authority that started
last summer.
   ``It's coming along very well,'' said Harry Kabler, a spokesman
for the authority.
   The Dallas experiment is being conducted on the North Dallas
Tollway and is currently limited to employees of AmTech of Texas,
one of two companies that has developed the automated system. The
Tollway is a heavily traveled, 20-mile-long highway between downtown
Dallas and its northern suburbs.

   Los Angeles county leads the nation in
population gains this decade, Wayne County, Mich., has lost the most
people, and the scattered residents of Loving County, Texas, make
the most money and the fewest babies, the Census Bureau says.
   More than 10,000 communities are profiled in the new ``City and
County Data Book: 1988'' published Wednesday by the bureau.
   The 964-page book, selling for $36, offers a wide range of data
about the nation's cities and counties, including government
finances, employment, vital statistics, social welfare programs,
income and other factors.
   In addition to information collected by the bureau, the volume
incorporates information collected by 15 other public and private
organizations including the National Center for Health Statistics,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, American Medical Association and
Elections Research Center.
   Here is a brief rundown of some of the county findings:
   _Most populous county, 1986: Los Angeles, 8,296,900.
   _Smallest county population, 1986: Kalawao, Hawaii, fewer than
100.
   _Most population growth, 1980-86: Los Angeles: 818,700.
   _Largest population decline, 1980-86: Wayne, Mich., 173,500.
   _Most people per square mile, 1986: New York county (Manhattan),
67,181.8.
   _Fewest people per square mile, 1986: 0.1 in Loving, Texas; North
Slope, Yukon-Koyukuk and Dillingham, all in Alaska.
   _Lowest percentage of whites, 1984: Macon, Ala., 13.2.
   _Highest percentage under age 5, 1984: Unita, Wyo.: 15.7.
   _Highest percentage aged 25 to 44, 1984: Juneau, Alaska: 43.6.
   _Highest percentage 65 and over, 1984: Pasco, Fla.: 32.7.
   _Highest birth rate, 1984: Wade Hampton, Alaska: 41.9 per 1,000.
   _Lowest birth rate, 1984: Loving, Texas and Yellowstone National
Park, Mont.: too low to calculate.
   _Highest per capita income, 1985: Loving, Texas: $34,173.
   _Lowest per capita income, 1985: Logan, Neb.: $2,209.

<HEAD>Reagan Calls Berlin Wall Litmus Test of East-West Relations</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs graf 7, Kohl was meeting, with meeting occurring.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan declared the Berlin Wall ``a
litmus test of East-West relations'' today as he held a farewell
meeting with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Kohl, responding through a translator at a departure ceremony on
the White House lawn, thanked Reagan for his efforts to improve
relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``Any kind of worsening in East-West relations will be felt like
an earthquake in our country, and of course first of all in
Berlin,'' Kohl said.
   Reagan, who will leave office Jan. 20, said, ``The divided city
of Berlin remains a powerful symbol of a divided Europe and a litmus
test of East-West relations.''
   The two leaders, who have been close allies, exchanged personal
best wishes along with discussion of issues.
   ``These have been good years,'' said Kohl. ``Both of us have
paved the way for a development that will be pursued by your
successor in office.''
   Kohl met with President-elect George Bush later in the day at the
vice president's residence.
   On Wednesday, Reagan meets with Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, whom he said Monday he respects more than any other world
leader he has met.
   Answering a question from a junior high school student as to
whether the United States would ever have a woman president, Reagan
said he thought it was inevitable.
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have met
that I respect the most is the Prime Minister of England, Margaret
Thatcher,'' he said. ``And she's done a remarkable job for England.''
   In London, columnist George Walden of the conservative Daily
Telegraph wrote, ``We must brace ourselves for a Niagara of mutual
admiration. The personal relationship has indeed been special.''
   Mrs. Thatcher is scheduled to meet on Thursday with Bush, who
will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20.
   There have been reports from London that the prime minister would
bring with her a proposal for an early meeting of Bush with other
NATO leaders.
   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said, ``We have nothing specific from the British in the
course of planning this visit that said the prime minister would be
bringing along a proposal of this kind, but we certainly wouldn't be
surprised if such a proposal came.''
   April 4 will be the 40th anniversary of the signing of the North
Atlantic Treaty, and such decade anniversaries have been observed in
the past by turning the annual spring ministerial meeting of NATO
into a heads of government meeting.
   ``We had heard that, as London, which is to be the site of the
spring ministerial, considered planning for that spring ministerial
in the 40th anniversary year, that some thought was being given to
that meeting being a summit,'' the official said.
   The meeting will be in late May or early June.
   A West German official who briefed a reporter on condition of
anonymity said Kohl's visit would enable him again ``to congratulate
the president-elect and to see with him what the immediate tasks for
both countries are.''
   Both the U.S. and West German officials said Kohl was expected to
discuss East-West relations with the president and to report on his
own meetings with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and other
Kremlin officials last month.
   Reagan last met with both Kohl and Mrs. Thatcher at the
seven-nation economic summit in Toronto last June. Kohl was last in
Washington in February and Mrs. Thatcher in July of 1987.

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi fell ill during his trial Tuesday, forcing the judge to
interrupt emotional testimony by a former American hostage.
   The trial was adjourned until Monday after a doctor examined
Hamadi and ruled the defendant was unable to follow the proceedings.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847, which was
diverted on an Athens-to-Rome route and forced to land in Beirut and
Algiers. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi told the court he was feeling ``very exhausted'' and
``very dizzy.''
   The session was adjourned for nearly an hour while he was
examined by a doctor, who told the court Hamadi was suffering from
dizzy spells and a headache.
   Circulation irregularities were blamed for the symptoms and
Hamadi was given a shot of glucose, said the doctor, who was not
identified by the court. She said Hamadi had been eating very little
and taking medicine to counter low blood pressure.
   The session was interrupted during the testimony of Burton Weber,
a 48-year-old American physician, who said he was returning from a
vacation in Greece with his wife and two daughters when the TWA
plane was seized.
   He described how he got up to go to a restroom and tried to find
his wife among the passengers.
   ``I looked everywhere on the plane but she wasn't there,'' Weber
said, his voice choked with emotion.
   ``First I thought she might have been killed, but then a
stewardess told me she had been released from the plane,'' he said.
Some of the passengers were released while the plane was in Algiers.
   Weber also testified how the hijackers robbed his wife of her
jewelry, which he valued ``in excess of $50,000.''
   Weber said one of the hijackers ``lectured us on the evils of
America, and it went on and on.''
   Like more than a dozen other American witnesses at the trial,
Weber also described the brutal beatings of passengers by the
hijackers.
   He said he had given a woman passenger an insulin shot, but that
the hijackers had refused his request to examine two men who were
severely beaten.
   ``They lay unconscious and looked dead. One had blood on his
shirt,'' Weber said.
   Weber's 21-year-old daughter, Marypat, who testified earlier in
the day, said she still suffers nightmares more than three years
after the ordeal.
   ``I have had nightmares and I'm scared of flying on planes,'' she
said.
   She also told the court she thought Hamadi directed the hijacking.
   ``I personally felt that Hamadi was more in charge and that he
was the leader,'' she said.
   Hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing
Stethem or robbing the passengers. He says the hijacking was
directed by his accomplice, fugitive Hassan Ezzeddine, who is at
large.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 when
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Spurt In Retail Sales Spurs Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales shot up 0.9 percent in October,
the strongest increase in seven months, the government said Tuesday
in a report that heightened inflation fears in the financial markets.
   Boosted by gains at department stores and auto dealerships, sales
rose to a seasonally adjusted $135.6 billion, the Commerce
Department said. It also revised its figures for the two previous
months, showing a brisker sales pace than previously thought.
   In response, bond prices fell Tuesday morning. Traders saw the
report as a sign of inflation. Too much consumer demand can strain
factory capacity, causing a shortage of goods and higher prices. It
also could encourage more imports and retard progress on whittling
the nation's trade gap.
   However, bond traders were hoping for good news on Wednesday with
the release of the merchandise trade deficit for September. Most
economists expect a decline in imports to narrow the September
deficit to $9.5 billion to $11 billion, down from $12.2 billion in
August.
   In another economic report Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board
said its index of industrial production increased a moderately
strong 0.4 percent in October, the biggest gain in three months.
   ``These numbers give a much different picture than just a month
ago. Some people were betting the expansion would die of old age.
These numbers refute that strongly,'' said David Jones, an economist
with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer in New
York.
   But, he said the unexpected strength has rekindled concern about
inflation, which had waned as growth cooled in August and September.
   ``There's the perception that in response, the Fed will move to
tighten credit at least modestly, pushing up interest rates,'' he
said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the reports
``are both very positive and very encouraging for continued steady
growth in the economy.''
   ``We see no evidence of rekindling inflation,'' he added.
   In the latest report, the government said retail sales fell 0.3
percent in September, up from an earlier estimate of a 0.4 percent
decline, and rose 0.3 percent in August, rather than falling 0.1
percent as previously thought.
   The October increase of 0.9 percent was the steepest since March,
when sales shot up 1.6 percent. Most economists had been expecting a
milder rise of about 0.3 percent last month.
   Auto sales in October jumped 1.7 percent to $29.2 billion, after
falling 2.2 percent a month earlier. However, it was only the second
increase since March.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a consulting
firm in Washington, said the pattern of retail buying is shifting
from ``hard goods,'' such as autos and appliances, to ``soft
goods,'' such as clothing, as the year winds up.
   Clothing sales were lackluster earlier this year partly because
of high prices and partly because women rejected new fashions, she
said.
   ``I think there is some pent up demand out there,'' she said. ``A
lot of women were just waiting it out through two years of
merchandise that was not appropriate for work.''
   Excluding the automotive category, which is the most volatile,
sales rose 0.7 percent last month after a 0.2 percent increase in
September.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up
2.4 percent to $15.6 billion last month, following a 0.8 percent
gain in September.
   Hardware, garden and building-supply stores reported no change in
October after a 0.8 percent rise a month earlier.
   Furniture stores posted a modest 0.2 percent gain after falling
0.3 percent in September.
   Food and grocery stores reported a 1.1 percent gain, gasoline
stations a 1.2 percent jump, specialty clothing stores a 1.3 percent
increase, and drug stores a 0.6 percent rise.
   The only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars,
down 0.2 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in September.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Co., noting
that the sales figures are not adjusted for inflation, said much of
the increases for food, gasoline, clothing and autos can be
attributed to higher prices.
   For the first 10 months of the year, overall sales were up 6.1
percent over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the
inflation rate.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stunning election upset by Scotland's
nationalists illustrates deepening Scottish dislike for the London
political establishment and could breathe new life into the campaign
for independence.
   Thursday's election in the Govan district of Glasgow was to fill
a vacant seat in Parliament, and since such by-elections are
traditionally an occasion for registering protest votes, the result
cannot be accurately projected over Scotland as a whole.
   But it is a spectacular victory for the Scottish National Party,
which seeks independence for Scotland, and a humiliation for the
Labor Party, the opposition in Parliament but the dominant force
north of the English border.
   In one of the biggest upsets in 40 years of British politics, the
SNP's Jim Sillars won 14,677 votes aginst 11,123 for Labor's Bob
Gillespie, a 38-percent swing from the June 1987 general election,
when Labor took Govan by a massive 19,509-vote majority.
   It was almost a rerun of 1973, when Sillars' wife, Margo
MacDonald, staged a similar upset in Govan for the SNP. By the
following year, after two general elections, the bandwagon effect
had taken nationalist strength in the 650-member House of Commons
from two seats to 11.
   By last year, however, the SNP was down to three seats. Now the
question is whether the latest result is a freak, or the precursor
of a 1970s-style revival.
   ``The Scottish people will now start marching towards their
destiny as an independent country with an independent economy,''
Sillars, 51, declared to cheering supporters after the result was
announced in the heavily blue-collar constituency.
   ``It's a pretty substantial blip,'' conceded Scottish Laborite
John Home Robertson. He warned Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that
``If she's not careful, and if this sort of bandwagon gets going,
she could actually split up the United Kingdom.''
   But the Conservatives, having harbored no expectations in Govan,
felt little disappointment with their paltry 2,207 votes, preferring
instead to mock Labor's defeat.
   ``Last night must be the first by-election where the protest vote
has been against the opposition rather than the government,''
taunted Tory government minister Michael Forsyth.
   Scotland's yen to end its 281-year-old union with England ebbs
and flows. Right now, says Professor James Kellas, a political
scientist at Glasgow University, ``there is a trend of Scottish
nationalism rising.''
   One reason is a widespread Scottish perception of Mrs. Thatcher
as a thoroughly English prime minister with no understanding of
Scottish concerns. ``There's a general feeling of Scottish interests
being neglected by the London government,'' Kellas said.
   Another reason is a new property tax that has provoked widespread
hostility in Scotland.
   The poll tax, or community charge, will be calculated per head
instead of on size of property, and is central to Mrs. Thatcher's
crusade against left-wing local authorities who tax the well-off to
finance welfare programs for the needy.
   An opinion poll on election night found 21 percent saying the
poll tax was the most important issue, compared with 19 percent who
cited unemployment.
   The SNP seized the opportunity. Where Labor opted for legal,
low-key opposition to the poll tax, the nationalists promised to
organize a non-payment campaign.
   Thus, says Kellas, ``the Labor Party appears powerless and
doesn't make enough impact. They're seen as playing the game
according to the rules, through peaceful opposition within the
confines of Parliament.''
   He says there's no telling whether the SNP will capitalize on its
triumph. Unlike in 1973, this time no general election is due for up
to four years, and the afterglow of Govan may not last that long.
   But at the same time, the SNP believes it has found a winning
formula _ ``independence within Europe.'' That means an independent
Scotland living alongside England and united with it through
membership in the European Economic Community.
   ``We are talking about freeing Scotland from England within the
context of the European Community, where England would be no more
than a friendly partner and there would be no control of Scotland
from England whatsoever,'' says Sillars.
   With the approach of 1992 and an end to tax barriers and frontier
restrictions within the EEC, that notion ``is looking more palatable
to people than in the past,'' said Kellas.
   Scottish social commentator Tom Nairn said Scots who in the past
would shy away from outright secession see the new formula as a way
of retaining an association with England while going independent.
   ``The formula is appealing,'' he said, ``because it smacks of
having your cake and eating it.''

   Two teen-agers already charged in incidents
of molesting young boys were charged Tuesday with an additional 302
counts of sodomy and sexual abuse, authorities said.
   The new charges bring to 20 the number of boys allegedly abused
at a home computer school in Great Neck operated by Arnold Friedman,
56.
   Friedman's son Jesse, 19, and his friend, Ross Goldstein, 18,
pleaded innocent to the new charges Tuesday before Nassau County
Judge Abbey Boklan.
   Boklan ordered Friedman continued free on $100,000 bail despite
the objections of Nassau County Prosecutor Joseph Onorato, who urged
bail of $200,000. He argued the additional charges against Friedman,
which bring the total to 250 counts, increase the risk that he will
flee.
   Goldstein was released on $25,000 bail.
   The latest indictment alleges that Friedman and Goldstein
sexually abused seven boys, ages 9 to 12, at the Friedman residence
in 1986 and 1987. The boys were students at the computer school.
   This latest indictment charges Jesse Friedman with 198 counts of
sodomy, sexual abuse, use of a child in a sexual performance and
endangering the welfare of a child.
   Goldstein had previously been arrested and charged with various
sex-abuse charges in connection with purported child sex orgies at
the Friedman residence in 1986 and 1987.
   Tuesday's indictment accuses Goldstein of 118 counts of
sex-related crimes.
   Friedman's father pleaded guilty last March to 42 sex-related
charges involving 13 boys who attended his home computer courses. He
is serving 10 to 30 years in prison. The sentence is concurrent with
a federal sentence that Friedman received for sending child
pornography through the mails.
   Goldstein and Jesse Friedman are scheduled for trial Jan. 4.

   Jubilant Palestinian youths set
off fireworks and chanted ``My Homeland, My Homeland'' Tuesday
despite tight security measures aimed at quelling fanfare over the
newly declared Palestinian independence.
   The celebrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip took on a
cat-and-mouse style, as youths violated curfews to send balloons
aloft with outlawed Palestinian flags or sing patriotic songs, then
ran and hid when army patrols arrived, Arab witnesses said.
   At least seven people suffered gunshot wounds in Gaza, where
650,000 Arab residents were under orders to stay in their homes,
hospital officials said. Military spokesmen had no reports of bullet
wounds.
   The army sealed the territories, setting up checkpoints on major
highways and barring Palestinians from entering Israel. Reporters
were allowed into the territories only with military escorts.
   A reporter escorted into Ramallah was told by a Palestinian woman
who gave only her first name, Marlin: ``Today we are very happy
because the PLO says we have an independent state. No matter that we
do not celebrate today. We will celebrate tomorrow or the next day.''
   The declaration of independence was announced early Tuesday by
PLO chief Yasser Arafat at a meeting of the Palestine National
Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, in Algiers, Algeria.
   Curfews were in force throughout Gaza and in at least 25 towns
and refugee camps in the West Bank, the army reported.
   Soldiers patrolled communities in jeeps and on foot. Armored
personnel carriers mounted with machine guns drove through the
streets of Bethlehem, and metal-plated gravel throwers used in riot
control were seen in downtown Nablus.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, 1,000 additional police and army troops
were brought in. An army officer who insisted on anonymity said
troop strength in some areas north of Jerusalem had been increased
three-fold.
   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to 1.5
million Palestinians, since the 1967 Middle East war. For the past
11 months, the army has been battling an uprising against Israeli
rule.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the PLO
declaration issued Tuesday in Algiers was ``double talk'' that did
not clearly recognize Israel or renounce terrorism.
   ``We still see the PLO as a terror organization,'' said ministry
spokesman Alon Liel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said of the PLO declaration: ``This
is another step in the war of Arab terror organizations against
Israel's existence and independence.''
   Some Palestinian leaders welcomed the declaration. ``It shows the
Palestinians are ready to co-exist with Israel, that they want a
state side-by-side with Israel,'' said Gaza Strip lawyer Fayez Abu
Rahme, a moderate among PLO supporters.
   But fundamentalist Moslem leaders opposed the move.
   ``We have been offering sacrifices for many years, and now they
recognize the state of the Jews,'' complained Sheik Mohammad Abu
Teir, a Moslem religious leader associated with the Hamas (Zeal)
movement.
   In Gaza City, hundreds of small colored balloons, each bearing a
tiny Palestinian flag, were released over the Shati refugee camp and
the city's Remal neighborhood, witnesses said. Soldiers fired tear
gas, they said.
   Tear gas also was used to disperse 50 youths who marched through
downtown banging on kitchen pots, dancing and shouting ``PLO, Israel
No!'' When the soldiers went away, the partying resumed, the
witnesses said.
   In Bethlehem, which was put under curfew for the first time since
1967, the night sky was lighted with firecrackers launched by bands
of youths.
   At the nearby Dheishe refugee camp, passing cars of Jewish
settlers were stoned.
   Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, was under curfew and
streets were deserted. Still, the voices of children could be heard
as they played on rooftops, and chanting of the Palestinian anthem
``My Homeland, My Homeland'' could be heard through windows.
   Arabs who live in Israel staged a one-day strike to protest
recent demolitions of houses in an action aimed to coincide with the
PLO declaration.
   A man in an army uniform and driving an army truck fired an Uzi
submachine gun at reporters covering the strike in the Israeli town
of Taibe, but no one was hurt. Police took the man away.

<HEAD>Former Police Officer Opens Fire On Blacks, Kills Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police officer belonging
to a neo-Nazi group opened fire on a group of blacks Tuesday in
downtown Pretoria, killing three and wounding 10 before he was
arrested, police said.
   The white gunman was identified as Barend Strydom, 23, who
resigned from the police force in February after an inquiry found
him guilty of improper behavior, including ``possession of radical
right-wing documents,'' police said.
   Strydom, dressed in a police camouflage jacket and armed with a
pistol, opened fire on a group of black street vendors, witnesses
said.
   As panicked pedestrians fled, the gunman ran along a sidewalk and
opened fire a second time before police arrested him near the State
Theater in Pretoria, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The rampage left one man and two women dead and at least 10 other
people wounded, police said. All the victims were black.
   Strydom is a member of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, said Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok. The gunman
claimed to be the leader of a right-wing faction called the White
Wolves, he said.
   In a related development, a man claiming to be the leader of the
White Wolves called the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld on Monday
night and threatened to kill President P.W. Botha if he released
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Botha spoke Monday night in Pretoria, but made no mention of
Mandela, the head of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   There has been widespread speculation that the government was
planning to release Mandela, who has been in prison 26 years.
   Tim du Plessis, a reporter with Beeld, said an Afrikaans-speaking
man claiming to be the leader of the White Wolves called him at his
office Monday night.
   The caller said he ``would have shot Mr. Botha dead had he
announced Mr. Mandela's release,'' du Plessis told the South Africa
Press Association. The caller said ``something'' would happen
Tuesday to prove the seriousness of the White Wolves, du Plessis
said.
   Police were investigating whether the caller was connected to the
attack in Pretoria.

   Methods of quelling civil disturbances such as tear
gas and clubs are more dangerous than the public perceives and can
be lethal, physicians said Tuesday at the American Public Health
Association's annual meeting.
   ``The problem we have is that in government and police and
military actions there are a variety of so-called non-lethal weapons
that are used,'' said Jonathan Fine, president of Physicians for
Human Rights. ``There's little public appreciation that some of
these devices and weapons are in fact lethal.''
   Fine said police and military forces using such things as tear
gas or guns loaded with rubber bullets should be made aware of their
potential danger.
   ``It really is important for police and military personnel to get
a better understanding for the medical consequences so that they be
used with more caution, more restraint, and in some cases be totally
banned,'' he said.
   ``Tear gas is a misnomer, if ever there was one. It's actually
poison gas,'' Fine said.
   Effects of tear gas were documented from observations of the
effects of tear gas used to control student demonstrators in South
Korea in June 1987, Fine said. While the common symptoms of crying,
coughing and nausea subside within a few hours, people living near
areas frequently gassed reported getting ``tear gas cold,'' a
persistent cough and sore throat for several weeks, he said.
   While police and government officials say crowd control methods
are vital to maintaining public security, Fine said the Physicians
for Human Rights believe the instruments used should be carefully
examined and their use should be limited.
   Other health care professionals at the seminar reported results
of a February trip to Israel observing casualties on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Jennifer Leaning, director of emergency services for the Harvard
Health Plan, said that of 103 injured people interviewed, 72 percent
had been injured within 24 hours of the interview. While gunshot
wounds accounted for 5 percent of the recently injured, the
remainder were due to rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs, she said.
   Many of the beating wounds were broken bones in the arm or hand.
   Leaning said the Israeli government cooperated with the
physicians' visit, but the team had difficulty interviewing injured
Israeli soldiers and spoke mainly with Palestinians. After the team
reported its findings, the Israeli government responded mainly by
pointing to an improved infant mortality rate on the West Bank and
Gaza.
   Velvl Greene, a professor of epidemiology at Ben Gurion
University in Beer Sheva, Israel, said the reports of injuries
suffered by Palestinians on the West Bank were biased because they
didn't take into account injuries inflicted by Palestinians.
   ``They're not demonstrations, they're attacks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israel Rejects PLO Declaration as `Double Talk'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel rejected the Palestinian declaration of
independence Tuesday as an exercise in ``ambiguity and double talk''
that neither renounces terrorism nor clearly recognizes the Jewish
state.
   Israel was put on the defensive by the move toward moderation,
however, and officials concede they face an uphill battle against
the PLO attempt to win recognition for a Palestinian state.
   The Palestine National Council, acting as the PLO legislature,
proclaimed the Palestinian state and issued a political declaration
accepting U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which implicity
recognizes Israel's right to exist. The declaration also limits PLO
guerrilla action to military targets in the occupied territories.
   Only leftist groups in Israel praised the PLO for moderating its
anti-Israeli language. Extreme right-wing groups urged the
government to respond by annexing part or all of the occupied lands
and establish new Jewish settlements.
   About 1.5 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers live in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 war.
   The Foreign Ministry, which issued the Israeli government's
official reaction, said of the PLO declaration: ``Ambiguity and
double talk are again employed to excuse its advocacy of violence,
resorting to terrorism and adherence to extreme positions.''
   Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said: ``They mentioned rejection of
terrorism outside Israel, but they did not denounce terrorism inside
Israel. So we still see the PLO as a terror organization, and the
government decision not to negotiate with the PLO stands.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is expected to lead a new
right-wing government, contended that moderating the PLO language
was merely a tactic, part of an overall strategy to destroy Israel.
   He said the declaration was ``another step in the war of Arab
terror organizations against Israel's existence and independence and
we shall respond accordingly.''
   U.S. Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., met with Shamir and described
him as ``very concerned that world public opinion will be taken in
by syrupy words in a great, vast hoax.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left Labor
Party and Shamir's rival, said there could be no Palestinian state
without negotiations involving Israel and the PLO declaration was
``yet another attempt to avoid making unequivocal decisions.''
   Avraham Sela, an international relations expert at Hebrew
University, said: ``It will be seen by Israelis as too little and
not convincing enough. The PLO needs to do something striking with a
clear intention,''
   Leil of the Foreign Ministry said: ``We realize we will have to
work very hard in order to explain our position in the world.''
   Analysts said the main problem for Israel is its lack of a
credible plan for starting peace negotiations and ending Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories that began nearly a year ago.
   Asher Susser, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University, said
the Algiers declaration may cause the world to look more favorably
on the PLO.
   ``Israel's position does seem to be rather inflexible as opposed
to what seems to be a softening of the PLO's position,'' he said in
an interview.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading member of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, called the declaration a ``dangerous
development.''
   Sharon said Israel might face economic sanctions and political
isolation, and should assert its own claim by imposing sovereignty
on part of the occupied lands.
   Yossi Sarid, a parliament member, was among leftists who welcomed
the more moderate PLO language. He praised Palestinian acceptance of
a 1947 U.N. partition resolution that envisioned both Jewish and
Arab states.
   ``Adoption of the partition principle by the PLO, indirect
recognition of Israel, and readiness for negotiations shows the PLO
has changed,'' he said.
   Susser of Tel Aviv University wording of the declaration
suggested the PLO viewed acceptance of a two-state solution only as
a ``necessary evil.''
   ``It's clearly an effort to have your cake and eat it too,'' he
said. ``That's what the PLO has been doing for years.''

   The Air Force has inspected and cleared more
than two-thirds of its B-1B bombers following a crash last week that
destroyed one of the long-range planes in Texas, officials said
Tuesday.
   Lt. Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman for the Strategic Air
Command, said 63 of the 85 B-1B's located at SAC bases had been
inspected as of Tuesday without any problems being detected.
   The remaining 13 planes in the B-1B fleet are currently assigned
to other Air Force units for such things as equipment testing and
minor modifications, Peck added, but at least four of those planes
also have been inspected and cleared.
   The latest totals mean 67 of the 98 bombers, or 68 percent, have
been checked since the Nov. 8 accident near Dyess Air Force Base,
Texas.
   In that accident, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near the
base _ the second accident to claim one of the new bombers in 14
months. The crew of four managed to eject and survived the accident.
   The Air Force has refused to speculate on the cause of the
accident, although a fire was observed by witnesses around the
plane's left two engines before the crash. SAC's grounding order
specified a mandatory inspection of electric, fuel and hydraulic
fluid lines.
   SAC, which is responsible for land-based nuclear bomber and
missile forces, has described the grounding and inspection order as
a ``normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident.
   The bombers have been deployed to four operational bases: Dyess;
Ellsworth AFB, S.D.; Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.

<HEAD>Bush Drew Support From GOP, Disaffected Voters, Survey Says</HEAD>

   George Bush won the presidential election by
solidifying his support with Republicans and successfully convincing
disaffected voters to back him, according to a post-election survey
released Tuesday.
   The poll, conducted by The Gallup Organization for the Times
Mirror Co., also said 44 percent of the respondents thought the
federal budget deficit should be the top priority for the Bush
administration. Other crucial issues for voters are protecting
American jobs and increasing programs for families and children.
   The telephone poll, one of several done for the Los Angeles-based
news company in 1988, measured responses from 2,022 registered
voters. The margin of error was three percentage points.
   Bush, who defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis by 54 percent to 46
percent on Nov. 8, did not entirely recreate the coalition that gave
President Reagan a resounding victory in 1984, the poll found.
   But by the second week in September, the vice president had put
together various elements that gave him a victory in November, the
survey indicated.
   ``While our surveys showed a fair degree of offsetting change
within Democratic groups between September and October, the overall
patterns of support first identified in September persisted through
Election Day,'' the pollsters said in a statement that accompanied
the results.
   Among the trends reflected in the poll are that Bush:
   _Bolstered support among core Republican groups between May and
late October.
   _Increased support among young, moderate voters during the same
period.
   _Seized the backing of disaffected voters, those
lower-middle-income people who feel alienated and tend to be
disgruntled.
   ``Bush could not have won with the disaffecteds,'' said Andrew
Kohut, Gallup's president. That group is estimated to comprise about
10 percent of the voting pool.
   In May, shortly after the end of the primary season, the
disaffecteds were evenly divided between Dukakis and Bush. By
September, their opinions of Dukakis had moved from lukewarm to
highly critical. Ultimately, 68 percent said they voted for Bush,
the survey found.
   Michael Traugott, a Gallup analyst, said Bush attracted the
disaffecteds by stressing his tough crime theme and pinning the
liberal label on Dukakis.
   In fact, the success of the Bush campaign was based on
highlighting the controversies over liberalism, the Pledge of
Allegiance and the prison furlough program.
   Among Dukakis voters, the most important campaign issues were the
allegations about Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra matter, the
administration's dealing with Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and the selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as the GOP vice
presidential candidate.
   Voters expressed some discontent with the campaign and the
candidates, the survey said. Some 63 percent who backed Dukakis said
they were dissatisfied with the candidates, while 16 percent of
those who voted for Bush expressed dissatisfaction.
   Respondents also were asked to rate others participants in the
political election. The news media and campaign consultants were
given the lowest marks on an A through F rating system. One in six
people gave the press a failing grade.
   Traugott said he thought the low grade given the press reflected
in part a lack of understanding of how reporters do their work.
Other surveys have shown, for instance, that the media as an
institution is evaluated highly.

   U.S. industrial production rose a moderately
strong 0.4 percent in October, the best increase in three months,
despite a decline in activity in the nation's oil fields, the
government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said its industrial production index
last month rose to a seasonally adjusted 139.2 percent of its 1977
base, reflecting increases in production of business equipment and
automobiles.
   ``We're not talking anything dramatic here, but it's a
comfortable gain,'' said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Noting that retail sales for the month also increased, Dederick
said, ``We're seeing strength in both the production side (of the
economy) and the demand side, which suggests that strength on the
production side can continue.''
   The October gain in production at factories, mines and utilities
was in line with economists' expectations. It followed smaller
increases of 0.2 percent in September, revised up from an earlier
estimate of no change, and 0.3 percent in August. Production jumped
1.1 percent in July.
   The index has not declined since September 1987, a reflection of
the strength in the manufacturing sector. A drop in the value of the
dollar has triggered a surge in sales of U.S. goods overseas this
year and a related boom in spending to expand and modernize
factories.
   However, economists have become worried that manufacturing may be
growing too strongly, straining production capacity and leading to
inflation. The relatively weak industrial production of August and
September had calmed those fears somewhat, but signs of a rebound in
October have rekindled the concern.
   ``What is needed is really rather subdued growth ... and that's
not what we're getting,'' Dederick said.
   Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in
October, following a 0.4 percent gain in September. The Federal
Reserve said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6
million units, up from 7.4 million units a month earlier and 7.0
million units in August.
   Production of business equipment jumped 0.8 percent for the
second month in a row and stood 9.4 percent higher than a year ago.
Within that category, production of manufacturing equipment rose 1.8
percent last month and 1.9 percent in September.
   Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, fell 0.9
percent in October, the third consecutive decline.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., forecasting firm, said falling world oil prices have curtailed
drilling in the United States.
   ``Over the last couple of weeks drilling activity has dropped off
sharply. You're going to see that continue,'' he said.
   Production at utilities rose 0.4 percent last month, following a
large drop of 3.8 percent in September, which was attributed to the
decline in electricity use for air conditioners following the summer
heat wave.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent
higher than a year ago.

   U.S.-Soviet arms talks aimed at slashing long-range
nuclear arsenals adjourned Tuesday until next year after a
four-month session, and U.S. negotiators said major disagreements
remain.
   The chief U.S. envoy, Max Kampelman, said an 11th round of talks,
hoped to ``move the process forward,'' will begin early next year
after President-elect George Bush assumes office Jan. 20.
   ``We are hoping for new progress'' under the Bush administration,
Moscow's chief delegate Alexei Obukhov said before a final full
meeting of both delegations at the Soviet diplomatic mission.
   Kampelman said he assured the Soviet delegation of Bush's
commitment to the talks and said the president-elect would maintain
``continuity'' in the U.S. position.
   ``We continue to move forward and are encouraged by that
movement,'' Kampelman said after the session. But he added: ``Major
disagreements remain. We understand each other better and we
understand the issues better.''
   ``It is just beginning. It will continue,'' he said of the
superpowers' effort to reduce their giant atomic arsenals.
   The latest round of talks began July 12. Two areas are involved:
the draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty aimed at cutting U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear forces by half, and defense and space.
   The talks began in March 1985 and have produced the U.S.-Soviet
agreement to scrap all intermediate-range missiles.
   ``We have significantly reduced both areas where positions are
starkly contrasting,'' U.S. negotiator S. Read Hanmer said of the
latest round.
   He said differences were narrowed on air-launched cruise
missiles, where agreed counting rules are being sought, and on
monitoring mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they are
included in the treaty.
   A long-standing disagreement remains over the range an
air-launched cruise missile must have to be included in the treaty,
Hanmer said.
   Kampelman indicated no progress was made on sea-launched cruise
missiles, which Moscow wants to limit under the pact. Washington has
resisted including them, saying they cannot be reliably monitored.
   Kampelman also said President Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative, the program for a space-based missile defense opposed by
the Soviets, remains a ``serious'' objective and is not a bargaining
chip at Geneva.
   The program, popularly called ``Star Wars,'' has been a stumbling
block since negotiations began.
   Kampelman said he was not aware of plans for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's fifth and final meeting with Reagan that U.S.
officials say has been set for next month in Washington.
   The summit would give the two sides another chance to narrow the
gap on START.
   The Geneva round formally ends Wednesday with a ceremony in which
the two sides will exchange copies of the START treaty draft.
   Kampelman, 68, said it was too early to talk about whether he
will remain chief negotiator in the Bush administration.

   George Bush returned to the nation's capital
today after four days of sun and surf in Florida and held his first
meeting as president-elect with a foreign head of government, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Bush also asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady today to remain
in his current post in the new administration.
   Brady is a former investment banker who served briefly as an
appointed member of the Senate. He is a longtime friend of the
president-elect, and was a key member of a circle of advisers that
Bush leaned on during his successful presidential campaign.
   Bush greeted Kohl outside the vice president's residence at the
Naval Observatory after the German's leader's lunch with President
Reagan.
   Asked by reporters if he would give Kohl reassurances on the U.S.
budget deficit, Bush said, ``the chancellor knows how strongly I
feel about doing something about that deficit.''
   Kohl agreed in German.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle was also on hand to greet Kohl
and two of his Cabinet members, West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Bush told reporters who asked what he hoped for from the meeting,
``Maybe I can get a little advice.''
   He returned to Washington earlier in the day after a four-day
vacation in Gulf Stream, Fla.
   ``Off to work,'' Bush said as he departed on Air Force Two from
Palm Beach International Airport. After landing at Andrews Air Force
Base outside Washington, he was flown by helicopter to his residence.
   Bush was to meet Wednesday with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   The White House announced today that Bush and Reagan would meet
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month when he visits
the United States to address the United Nations.
   On the eve of his departure for Washington, Bush was joined at a
beachfront vacation home for dinner by New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu, a top campaign adviser mentioned as a candidate for White
House chief of staff.
   But Bush laughingly told reporters not to ``read too much into''
the visit by Sununu, who was the only political associate to see
Bush on vacation and who flew back to Washington with Bush.
   Asked by reporters about his prospects for the chief of staff
job, Sununu said, ``I'm still governor.'' Pressed further, he said,
``I'll do whatever he needs.'' He said he and Bush ``discussed
things in general. ...He will talk specifics in about a week or so.''
   Bush told reporters in a beachfront question-and-answer session
that his meetings with Kohl and Thatcher would focus on ``talking
about where we go after I become president, but it should be viewed
as a continuation of existing policy.''
   Bush also sought to reassure a nervous international financial
community that the U.S. budget deficit will be a top priority at the
start of his administration.
   ``It is a matter of great urgency ... and I want to be in the
forefront of trying to do something about it after I become
president,'' he said.
   Bush's campaign promise to reject any tax increases has led some
analysts to question whether he is serious about reducing the
deficit. He was been dogged by reports of a declining dollar abroad
and a dramatic drop in the Dow Jones industrial average after his
election.
   The calming statements had an impact on financial trading Monday
and today, however, as the dollar rebounded on most international
financial markets after its downward spiral last week. Several
traders credited the statements with calming fears that Bush's
advisers want the U.S. currency to fall further.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which took an
election-week loss of nearly 80 points last weeks, fell 1.95 on
Monday to record its fourth consecutive losing session.
   In Washington, the incoming chairman of the House Budget
Committee said tax increases will be needed next year to make
legally required cuts in the deficit.
   ``Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size of the
challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   Bush, however, dismissed the financial unrest by saying, ``These
gyrations happen.''
   Bush said he will tackle the deficit ``early on in my
presidency'' but added, ``I do not want to start acting like I am
president of the United States yet.''
   He was expected to name former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard
Darman as budget director and Stanford University professor Michael
Boskin as White House economics adviser.
   Bush aides said that a list of three to five names is being drawn
up for him to consider for each Cabinet post.
   Bush also was asked about a report suggesting that Baker, his
choice as secretary of state, would wield clout as a ``deputy
president.''
   Bush replied: ``You haven't heard that here.''
   On reports that a three-person chief-of-staff arrangement was
under consideration, Bush said, ``Stay tuned. I'll have
announcements on that pretty soon.''
   On other topics:
   _Bush sidestepped a question about whether he would name a woman
to his Cabinet, coining a new word in the process. ``I will
anticipate there will be female representation in the Cabinet, but
... I don't like to put it like that sounds kind of quotaistic.''
   _ He rejected allegations that government foreclosure warnings to
80,000 farmers were held up until after the election.
   ``I don't believe there's any political motivation related to
agricultural policies at all,'' he said.

   The next first lady of the United States is
getting ready for the 29th move of her married life and, as usual,
she is taking her bed and pillows.
   Barbara Bush said she and President-elect George Bush always take
their bed with them as they have moved from city to city during his
public career.
   Their move from the vice president's official residence on the
Washington Naval Observatory grounds to the White House on
Pennsylvania Avenue will be no different in that respect, she told
reporters flying aboard Air Force Two as the couple returned on
Tuesday from a post-election vacation in Florida.
   Mrs. Bush said she will start packing for the move when they
return from their Thanksgiving holiday in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   She said first lady Nancy Reagan already has moved the Reagan
furniture out of the White House residence and found replacements
for the pieces they took. The Reagans are retiring to California.
   Mrs. Bush said she and the president-elect do not have many items
of furniture. But she does anticipate a staggering job of packing.
   ``I have a whole roomful of toys,'' said the grandmother of 10.
   Mrs. Bush said the entire Bush clan, the couple's five children
and spouses, are expected at the inauguration in January, but she
expressed concern that her son Neil's pregnant wife would be up to
the trip.
   In an informal chat with reporters during which she kept a
watchful eye on her dog Millie, who was roaming the plane aisle,
Mrs. Bush also fueled speculation about the political aspirations of
her children.
   ``I think someday a couple of my boys will run for office,'' she
said.
   One prospect is the Bushes' oldest son, George W. Bush, 42, who
is moving his family back to Dallas. They had moved to Washington so
he could work full time on his father's campaign.
   As her husband had indicated a day earlier, Mrs. Bush said she
did not know if son George was planning to run for governor of Texas.
   Mrs. Bush said her son Neil ``is dying'' to run for office. Neil
Bush is in the oil business in Denver.

   Pennsylvania must begin providing autistic
children with the special education and attention their handicap
demands, a House committee said in a report approved Tuesday.
   The House Select Committee to Study Autism voted unanimously to
accept a draft report that outlines ways the state can help autistic
children.
   There are about 15,000 autistic adults and children in the state,
Committee Chairman Joseph F. Markosek estimated.
   The 32-page report will be put into bill form for introduction
during next year's legislative session, Markosek said. The current
legislative session ends Nov. 30.
   As defined in the report, autism is a mental disorder that is a
``severely incapacitating, lifelong developmental disability'' that
usually appears from birth to age 3. Autistic children suffer from
poor social relationships, impaired communication, and persistent
repetitive and restrictive behavior, the report said.
   The state's failure to recognize autism as an illness different
from other mental disorders results in autistic children being
placed in educational courses that do not meet their needs, Markosek
said.
   ``Since there are no formal categories, the children are placed
in the category of being mentally retarded,'' he said, adding that
``a lot of times they get training that is inappropriate for them.''
   Yvonne Husic, a lobbyist for the Association For Retarded
Citizens of Pennsylvania, said because autism is not recognized as a
separate disorder, autistic children are ``falling between the
cracks.''
   The report recommends developing in-service training programs on
autism for professionals who deal with handicapped children,
educating parents on ways to help their autistic children at home,
and implementing programs to help the autistic move into regular
classrooms, vocational training programs or the community.
   Also included in the report is a long-range recommendation that
the state set up two regional centers for helping autistic children.

<TEXT>
   A minister is suggesting that various
congregations could save money and reduce waste by joining forces to
build a high-rise church, with one floor for each denomination and
shared meeting areas.
   The Rev. Ronald Nevin, pastor of Episcopal Church of the
Ascension in Wilmington, says such partner congregations could sell
their land and put the money into a trust fund to help the needy.
   Nevin, 55, doesn't propose all churches move in this direction.
   But he estimated that six churches within four miles of his
church use their sanctuaries no more than 20 hours a week, and said
the issue of under-used or wasted space needs to be considered.
   ``It is simply outrageous _ not to say un-Christian and a
betrayal of the gospel _ that in those places where unfortunate
people are most to be found, empty buildings and rarely used
buildings are owned by people who call themselves by the name of
Christ, who himself had nowhere to lay his head,'' Nevin said.
   However, he said, ``Whenever I've shared it with other clergy,
they've said, `Yes, it is interesting, but it will never happen.'
They just shrug it off.''
   George F. Cora, executive director of the Delmarva Ecumenical
Agency, who has worked as a Catholic priest in a shared church
building in Columbia, Md., said that sharing a building ``does
promote ecumenism to some extent.''
   ``It doesn't solve all the problems, in the sense that people
still want to be organized in groups small enough so they can know
each other,'' Cora said.
   The Rev. Charles O. Walter, pastor of Holly Oak United Methodist
Church in Wilmington, said he hoped the proposal would be seriously
explored.
   ``Part of me says it's important for historical reasons to
maintain my church, but ... I would probably agree to it a little
bit reluctantly to serve the greater good ...,'' Walter said.
   ``The most attractive part of it is you'd be able to spend more
money on missions and not just on taking care of church property,''
Walter said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of ``silent'' episodes of cardiac
distress show that an absence of pain does not mean an absence of
heart problems, scientists reported Tuesday at a meeting of the
American Heart Association.
   The temporary reduction of blood flow to the heart, a condition
called ischemia, can occur with no symptoms and no pain, an thus are
``silent.'' Yet, doctors said at news conference, these episodes
indicate that a patient may be in real danger of serious heart
disease or even fatal heart attack.
   Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida said many
cardiologists now recognize that silent ischemia can strike time
after time and never leave a trace of pain or discomfort to signal
that there is a problem.
   ``It can occur in subjects who have never had a symptom of heart
disease,'' he said, yet new techniques of measuring heart activity
have determined that silent ischemia occurs often, and can last for
hours.
   Usually a reduced flow of blood to the heart will cause chest
pain. Severe pains are called angina pectoris and usually quickly
send patients to the doctor.
   Vessels narrowed by disease, spasms or blood clots can all block
or impede blood flow to the heart. If it's serious enough, the
result is a major heart attack and much pain. But even Pepine said
doctors now realize that even when there is no pain, the heart may
be under seige.
   Dr. Sydney O. Gottlieb of Johns Hopkins University Medical
Institutions said tests using ambulatory electrocardigams, which
record activity of the heart for 24 continuous hours, are able to
detect episodes not felt by the patient.
   Such patients, he said, can be ``at very much higher risk of
subsequent heart attack'' and should be treated more aggressively
than their pain symptoms would indicate.
   Among patients being treated for heart attack and doing well,
said Gottlieb, the indications of silent attack ``is a very potent
marker for those who are at high risk for mortalilty in the
subsequent year.''
   Gottlieb said it would be impractical to test everyone for these
silent attacks, but he said his experiences suggest it would be
reasonable to test people, such as middle-aged men, who have a
number of other risk factors, such as a family history of heart
disease, cigarette smoking or high cholesterol readings.
   Treadmill stress tests, he said, have been very successful in
finding silent, pain-free heart disease that might otherwise have
not been detected. In these tests, subjects are attached to sensors
that monitor heart function while they walk on a treadmill.
   ``Even in an individual who is not having pain, poor performance
on a treadmill can identify those relatively well individuals who
are at high risk for a coronary event,'' Gottlieb said.
   He said he recently tested a middle-aged firefighter who was
totally pain free and had never been diagnosed with a heart
condition.
   Within 2{ minutes on the treadmill, Gottlieb said, the sensors
detected a severely stressed heart. Later tests using X rays showed
that one major cardiac artery was completely blocked and another had
only 10 percent flow.
   ``He was a walking time bomb,'' Gottlieb said. ``Yet, he played
tennis, felt well and said he never had any pain.''
   Pepine said studies have proven that the silent attacks occur
often, and that they are predictive of more serious heart problems.
But studies have yet to demonstrate that treating patients with
silent ischemia can extend their lives. He said such studies are now
under way.
   Dr. Stephen P. Glasser of the University of South Florida College
of Medicine said that though tests have proven that these silent
attacks occur, scientists still don't know why some patients feel no
pain.
   ``People's pain thresholds are different,'' he said. ``It might
be that people with high thresholds might be more apt to have these
silent episodes.''

<HEAD>Bush Asks Brady to Remain as Treasury Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush today named
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, a longtime friend, to remain in
his current post in the new administration.
   Bush said his appointee for the Treasury understands the need to
keep inflation low and ``knows that we must resist the policies that
will impede that effort such as raising taxes or resorting to
protection.''
   Added the president-elect, ``He knows we've got to sit down with
the Congress on a deficit reduction agreement and we've got to do it
soon.''
   Bush, fresh from a long weekend of relaxation in the Florida
sunshine, appeared with Brady outside the vice president's official
residence.
   For his part, Brady said he would ``do my best to help the
president-elect, serve the people and to build on this, the longest
recovery in the history of the country.'' Brady said he had no
comment on the dollar, which has fallen in recent days.
   Bush said he would make no other appointments during the day. He
said he felt no pressure to name a new chief of staff but added he
might do so ``fairly soon.''
   The president-elect dined alone Monday night with New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu, believed to be a leading candidate for the top
staff job in the new White House. Sununu walked off Air Force Two
just behind the Bushes when they arrived in Washington earlier in
the day.
   Brady's appointment marked the second time that Bush has turned
to a longtime confidante to fill a key post in his administration.
Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III was Bush's first
Cabinet appointment, announced the morning after his election last
week.
   Bush described Brady, a former chairman of the investment banking
house of Dillon, Read & Co., as a man who ``brings to his office an
extraordinary knowledge of financial markets, experience in the
private sector'' and said he was ``very well respected both here and
abroad.''
   Bush announced the appointment of Brady after meeting privately
with visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Brady, 58, served briefly as an appointed member of the Senate
from New Jersey. He is a longtime friend of the president-elect, and
was a key member of a circle of advisers that Bush leaned on during
his successful presidential campaign.
   The appointment came as no surprise. President Reagan appointed
Brady to his Cabinet post last summer, and it was long expected that
Bush would keep his old friend in the Cabinet if he won the
presidential election.
   Bush made the appointment in an uncertain international economic
atmosphere. The value of the dollar fell sharply last week, dragging
down stock prices as well because of investor fears over Bush's
economic policies.
   To calm jitters, Bush and Brady both acted in recent days to
reassure investors that the new administration had no secret plan to
drive down the value of the dollar.

<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Under the U.N. partition plan of 1947 the West Bank was
to have been the nucleus of an independent Palestinian state, but in
the 1948 war Israel captured some of the area allotted to Palestine
and Jordan annexed the rest. In 1967, Israel captured Jordan's share
of the West Bank and took the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LANDS _ The West Bank is two bulges of land on the west side
of the Jordan River, with Jerusalem between them, totaling 2,323
square miles. The Gaza Strip is a coastal slip of land that covers
141 square miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ About 850,000 Palestinians live in the West Bank,
including 400,000 refugees whose families fled the territory that
became Israel in 1948. Since Israeli occupation began in 1967,
62,000 Jewish settlers have established more than 100 settlements on
land expropriated by the government. More than two-thirds of Gaza's
650,000 Palestinian residents are refugees crowded into eight U.N.
camps, many living in single-room shacks built from scraps of wood
and corrugated iron. About 8,000 Jewish settlers also live in the
Gaza Strip.

   President Reagan and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, calling each other ``Dear Ron'' and ``Helmut,'' bade
their farewells on the sunlit South Lawn of the White House on
Tuesday after six years of close alliance on the world stage.
   Reagan reaffirmed ``the strong American commitment to Berlin''
and said, ``That divided city ... remains a powerful symbol of a
divided Europe and a litmus test of East-West relations.''
   Kohl thanked the American president for his ``bold and resolute
commitment to improving East-West relations'' and said, ``Any kind
of worsening of the situation between East and West will by felt
like an earthquake in our country ... and, of course, first of all
in Berlin.''
   It was an unseasonally balmy day, and even warmer weather is
forecast for Wednesday, when Reagan holds a similar meeting with
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Neither Reagan nor Kohl broke any new ground in their meeting or
the formal departure statements that followed it.
   Reagan said that the two countries ``continue to seek ways to
share early the risks, burdens and responsibilities, as well as the
benfits, of our common defense.''
   ``We reviewed the difficulties each country faces in doing more,
but pledge we would each do our fair share,'' the president said.
   He congratulated Kohl on the decision of the European Community
member states to take steps toward closer economic integration by
the end of 1992 and expressed ``our concern that this be done in a
manner that promotes fair trade internationally.''
   They devoted much of their closing statements, however, to
reminiscence and farewell.
   ``Helmut, this marks my last meeting as president with you,''
Reagan said. ``Six years ago, we stood together as I announced the
formation of a presidential commission to commemorate the
tricentennial of the first German settlement in the United States.
Six years to the day, I'm proud to announce a product of that
commission _ the dedication of a garden, here in Washington, as a
symbol of the friendship between our two countries.''
   ``In a few months, I`ll be leaving the White House,'' he said.
``But, the garden _ and all it represents _ will remain, to be
nurtured and sustained by the friendship between Germans and
Americans and by the leadership that you have provided.''
   Kohl, speaking through an interpreter, told Reagan, ``I believe
we can say, Mr. President, Dear Ron, we can put it very briefly and
say these have been good years. I think that both of us have paved
the way for development which will be pursued by your successor in
office.
   ... God bless you in all you do.''

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted Teamsters union ``ghost'' employee
testified Tuesday that Jackie Presser set up a $110,000 embezzlement
scheme to pay people who did no work for the union.
   Federal prosecutors have said Presser, who at the time of his
death July 9 faced embezzlement and labor racketeering charges,
masterminded a scheme to issue $700,000 worth of union paychecks to
such people, a form of embezzlement known as ghosting.
   Two other Local 507 officials now are on trial in the alleged
scheme.
   John A. ``Jack'' Nardi Jr., a prison inmate and a federally
protected witness, testified he received paychecks of at least $300
a week from Local 507 in Cleveland from late 1971 through 1978,
while never reporting for work.
   Federal labor laws require union leaders to use dues from union
members for the benefit of those members.
   Nardi, son of the late Cleveland Teamsters official John A.
Nardi, last April struck a plea bargain and and entered a guilty
plea to embezzling Local 507 funds and also arranging to accept a
bribe from Presser to cover up the embezzlement. Sentencing was
deferred until after the present trial.
   He is in prison on a state grand theft conviction.
   Presser was secretary-treasurer at Local 507 and president of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1983 until his death
from cancer.
   Nardi testified that his father told him in late 1971 that an
arrangement had been made for him to work for Presser. Nardi said
that in a meeting with Presser, his role was never clarified, but
that his starting pay was set at $300 a week, and his checks
starting coming every week in the mail.
   Nardi said he never worked even one day for Local 507.
   He said Presser and Harold Friedman, Local 507 president, signed
his checks.
   John A. Nardi, who was secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 410
and a reputed organized crime figure, was killed in a car bomb blast
in 1977. Nardi Jr. testified that at his father's funeral, Presser
reassurred him his pay would continue.
   He said the paychecks stopped after 1978, when, he said, Presser
told him about concerns he had with a possible federal investigation
into the payments.
   Friedman, 66, is still president of Local 507 and is one of the
nation's most powerful Teamsters officials. He has been a Teamsters
international vice president since 1983 and also is president of
Teamsters Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio and the Ohio Conference
of Teamsters.
   He is charged with two counts of labor racketeering, two of
embezzlement of union funds and two of making false statements to
the Department of Labor.
   Anthony Hughes, 52, recording secretary at Teamsters Local 507
and a business agent at Bakery Workers Local 19, is charged with two
counts of labor racketeering and one count of embezzlement.
   Pretrial documents indicated that Presser's defense in the
``ghost employee'' allegation would have been that he was authorized
by the FBI to hire certain people onto the union's payroll in order
to preserve his secret status as an FBI informant. The so-called
``ghosts'' were described as being able to provide information
largely about organized crime activity.

<HEAD>Doctors Weigh Whether To Separate Siamese Twins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>

   A doctor who delivered Siamese twins said his
first indication of the unusual birth was the sight of three arms
emerging from the incision he made for a Caesarean section.
   ``On the fetal monitor, there was only one heartbeat and it was
perfect. The baby appeared to be of normal size. There was no fetal
distress,'' said Charles Kim, the obstetrician-gynecologist who
delivered the twins Sunday at Frederick Memorial Hospital.
   Shortly after birth they were brought to University of Maryland
Hospital in Baltimore.
   ``We were expecting one baby, not two babies joined together at
the chest and upper abdomen,'' Kim said.
   When Kim made the incision, ``Three arms came out and I knew
definitely that something was going on,'' he said. ``I also knew the
first incision would not work. The baby was trapped. I was afraid we
might damage the baby.''
   Kim said he quickly made another incision.
   ``We could see the baby was not in good shape _ its color was
poor, it was lethargic and not breathing well,'' Kim said. ``Then, I
had a very big, astonishing surprise. We didn't have one baby. We
had two that were conjoined. After I calmed down, I did my surgery.''
   Siamese twins, which result when a fertilized egg fails to divide
completely, occur once every 50,000 to 100,000 live births. About
half of such twins die within 48 hours of birth.
   The parents, who live in Frederick and have one other child, have
asked that their names and details of the twins be withheld,
including their sex and whether dcotors will try to separate them.
   ``I think the parents are still in shock,'' said Karen Harrop,
University Hospital spokeswoman. ``It will be a couple of days
before our physicians can say whether we can do anything for the
babies.''
   Kim said he did not perform a sonogram, or ultrasound test, which
can detect multiple pregnancies, physical abnormalities and
determine fetal age, because the mother did not want one.
   In March 1982, Siamese twins joined from the chest to the abdomen
were successfully separated in a 10-hour operation at Johns Hopkins
Hospital.
   And 14 months ago, Hopkins made medical history when Patrick and
Benjamin Binder of Ulm, West Germany, became the first Siamese twins
ever to survive separation at the head.

   A damp breeze made for poor putting
weather Tuesday, but Soviet officials touring a golf course similar
to one being built in their country said it made them feel right at
home.
   ``This is the Reds visiting the greens,'' said Robert Trent Jones
Jr., architect of both the SentryWorld 18-hole course here and the
course just outside Moscow.
   The Soviets signed an agreement with Jones last June during the
summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The five Soviet officials touring the Wisconsin course laughed as
they rode in golf carts for the first time and tried their hand at
putting a few balls.
   Then they studied both how the course is managed and the
machinery used to groom it.
   ``Too many machines and cars is needed for decoration of the golf
course,'' said Valentin Maltsev, vice president of Techno Export
Moscow, as he toured the maintenance building where Sentry Insurance
keeps about 100 pieces of machinery.
   The Soviets came to northern Wisconsin to see the par-72 golf
course because it was built despite some of the same problems the
site 35 kilometers west of Moscow faces, said Ivan Sergeev of the
administration for services for the diplomatic corps. Like northern
Wisconsin, the Moscow site is relatively flat and forested and the
trees must be removed and lakes built, he said.
   ``The climate in the area of Moscow is almost exactly what it is
here,'' Sergeev said through an interpreter.
   The Soviet course, expected to open in 1991, will be the
country's first championship course and will be open six months a
year, he said.
   ``In the winter, it will not be open because it will be lying
under a lot of snow,'' Sergeev said.
   The Soviet course will provide an opportunity for visitors and
diplomats to play golf in Moscow, he said.
   But Sergeev said he hoped the Soviet course ``will be a place to
rest and not to do business on the golf course'' as is often done in
the United States.
   The quality of rest is a matter of opinion. The Soviet course
will not have golf carts.
   ``That's an American way. The Russian way, we walk,'' he said.

   Potato seedlings treated with a genetically
modified bacteria designed to protect plants from frost damage
suffered one-third as much damage as unprotected plants, a
researcher reported Tuesday.
   Two years of small-scale field tests proved the procedure to be
safe and effective, according to Steven Lindow, associate professor
of plant pathology at the University of California at Berkeley's
College of Natural Resources.
   Lindow was scheduled to report his findings Tuesday at the annual
meeting of the American Phytopathological Society in San Diego.
   Similar research by other scientists has shown that genetically
modified bacteria can protect strawberry plants from frost.
   The minor genetic modification was designed to counter the effect
of common bacteria whose structure triggers frost formation on
plants at temperatures just below freezing. Lindow and an associate
genetically modified a strain of the bacteria so it lacked the
frost-promoting gene but was otherwise unchanged.
   The modified bacteria was applied to potato seedlings before
naturally occurring bacteria could gain hold. Monitoring showed that
the modified bacteria could not be detected beyond the experiment's
93-foot buffer zone.
   Lindow's field tests were delayed for almost four years because
of safety concerns about outdoor experiments using genetically
engineered organisms.
   But Lindow said the genetically altered bacteria ``won't thrive
outside of the treated area'' because other bacteria are established
there.
   Established frost-fighting methods such as sprinklers and wind
machines can be more effective but they work in a narrower
temperature range and are more expensive to administer than the
bacteria strategy, Lindow said.

   Romania defeated Peru 3-1 Tuesday in the
third round of the Chess Olympiad and took first place with 11
points out of a possible 12.
   The Soviet Union is in second place with 9{ points and one
unfinished game.
   England and Bulgaria are tied for third with 9{ points.
   The Soviets lead Argentina 3-0, but on board two, Anatoly Karpov
has adjourned in an equal position against Argentinian Grandmaster
Oscar Panno. On board one, world champion Garri Kasparov, scored a
crushing 36-move victory against Daniel Campora.
   Bulgaria moved up with a devastating 3{-{ win over Singapore,
while England, the second seed, defeated Israel 3-1.
   Hungary, seeded third, placed sixth after a 2-2 draw with
Czechoslovakia.
   A win scores one point and a draw scores a half-point.
   The Olympiad, a biennial world team championship, features 107
teams from 106 nations. The event is held under the auspices of the
127-member World Chess Federation.
   The biggest upset of the day occured when China, seeded only
27th, scored a 3-1 victory over fifth-seeded Yugoslavia. On board
two, Ye Tiangchuan defeated Yuoslavia's Predrag Nikolic. In the
second round Monday, he defeated Larry Christiansen of the United
States.
   In the match between the United States and Canada, grandmaster
Boris Gulko, who emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1986, defeated
Canada's board one, international master Igor Ivanov, a Soviet
defector. Gulko is ``Grandmaster in Residence'' at Harvard
University.
   In an unusual double, Gulko's wife, Anna Aksharumova, playing on
board one for the U.S. women's team was paired with Tatiana
Lematchko, a Bulgarian defector who represents Switzerland. The game
has been adjourned with Aksharumova two pawns ahead in an endgame.
   ``Today was the day the emigrants played against the refugees,''
said Gulko after his 28-move victory.
   The adjourned games will be played out on Wednesday, before the
fourth round. The 14-round contest is scheduled to finish Nov. 29.

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Tuesday it
was up to the United States to make the next move toward Middle East
peace now that the Palestinians have formed an independent state
that implicitly recognizes Israel.
   ``The ball is now in the American court,'' Arafat said a few
hours after the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, solemnly proclaimed Palestinian independence in
a ceremony early Tuesday.
   The declaration accepted U.N. Security Council Resolution 242,
which implicitly recognizes Israel when it refers to the right of
all countries in the region to live within secure and recognized
borders.
   The proclamation topped the list of issues taken up during the
council's four-day special session in Algeria, which ended Tuesday.
The 450-member council also voted to form a provisional government
at a future date and pledged to restrict guerrilla operations to
military targets in Israeli-occupied territories.
   The council's move, largely symbolic and clearly aimed at
capitalizing on the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in
Israeli-occupied lands, sought to remove obstacles to U.S. and
Israeli dealings with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Referring to the intefadeh, or uprising, Arafat told a news
conference: ``It is true that this is the intefadeh session of the
(council), but it also could be the session of peace with the U.S.
administration and Israel.''
   The PLO chief said the council had given him a mandate to pursue
a political settlement. ``But if we are met with a rebuff,'' he
said, ``only God knows the outcome.''
   ``Let it also be clear, I can always come back to our (council)
and declare that moderation does not pay,'' Arafat said.
   Israel immediately rejected Arafat's declaration, calling it
``double talk'' and denying that it recognized Israel or truly
renounced terrorism.
   ``They mentioned rejection of terrorism outside Israel, but they
did not denounce terrorism inside Israel,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Alon Liel. ``So we still see the PLO as a terror
organization, and the government decision not to negotiate with the
PLO stands.''
   Washington also rejected the move, saying that the Middle East
conflict had to be resolved by negotiations, not a unilateral act on
either side.
   The United States has demanded the PLO recognize Israel and
renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings.
   The declaration, which Arafat read out at a seaside conference
center west of the Algerian capital, did not specifically describe
the new state's borders. But officials said it was clear the
``Palestinian territory'' referred to was the West Bank and Gaza,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``We are obviously talking about land occupied in 1967,'' said
Nabil Shaath, head of the political committee that drafted the
document. Of accepting Resolution 242, he said: ``It's a bitter
pill, but we had to swallow it.''
   Resolution 242 also calls on Israel to withdraw from territories
it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. In
the past, the PLO has refused to accept the resolution because it
deals with the future of Palestinians as merely a refegee problem.
   Late in the afternoon, the PLO announced its state had been
recognized by 12 countries, most Arab and Moslem PLO supporters.
Arafat, accompanied by other PLO officials, laid the cornerstone for
the first embassy of the Palestinian state in a suburb of Algiers.
The Algerian government donated the land.
   A member of the PLO's political department who asked not to be
named said that aside from waiting for the United States to act, the
organization also so plans to launch another diplomatic offensive in
Europe and elsewhere.
   ``We are expecting a new declaration from the European (Economic)
Community,'' said the official, adding that discussions would be
aimed particularly at Greece and Spain. Greece is the current
president and Spain steps in next in the rotating common market
presidency.
   ``It's a new era in Palestinian political thinking,'' said the
official. ``In the past, we talked about dreams. Now, we are talking
about realities.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, warning
that America's security in the next century will depend upon
advanced research being performed now, said Tuesday he wanted to
increase by $300 million the Pentagon's support of independent
corporate research.
   Carlucci, in a speech at American University, said he had been
reviewing Pentagon spending on ``independent research and
development'' and that despite the national budget deficit, could
not support cuts in such spending.
   ``This independent R&D program allows corporations full
flexibility in determining what research and development to conduct,
while at the same time enabling the Defense Department to identify
emerging technologies judged to have important defense
applications,'' Carlucci said.
   ``In 1987, the Defense Department reimbursed contractors for $3.6
billion of the more than $7 billion they spent on IR&D. As a measure
of this program's effectiveness, I want to announce today that I
will submit a 1990 budget request to the president allotting an
additional $300 million to underwrite independent R&D.''
   Carlucci described the move as one of four key steps to
maintaining America's technological lead over the Soviet Union in
military weaponry.
   The other steps include maintaining effective controls against
technology theft and espionage; more cooperation with Western allies
who also are pushing back technological frontiers; and supporting a
healthy defense industrial base of Pentagon contractors.
   In his speech, a copy of which was released in advance at the
Pentagon, Carlucci expressed optimism about each of the four steps
except one: the U.S. industrial base.
   ``This, I am sorry to say, is at present a dark cloud on the
strategic horizon,'' he said.
   ``There are unmistakable signs that right now, our defense
industrial base is shrinking _ the result of a defense budgeting
process and acquisition system that combine chronic instability and
excessive regulation, with predictable results.
   ``We need to put an end to this erosion; streamline and stabilize
the system, and create a more hospitable climate for technological
innovation and growth.''
   Carlucci is expected to step down in January when Vice President
George Bush is inaugurated as president and thus the fate of his
recommendation for increased research spending remains unclear.
   However, the Pentagon had been widely rumored in recent months to
be considering a cut in such funding and thus Carlucci's endorsement
of an actual increase might carry great weight with his successor.
   Earlier in his speech Tuesday, delivered before the Kennedy
Political Union at the university, Carlucci asserted technology had
made it possible for the United States ``to meet its national
security needs without militarizing society.''
   ``Rather than engaging in a contest to match potential
adversaries soldier for soldier, ship for ship or tank for tank, we
have sought to turn our technological superiority to our strategic
advantage. To a large extent, we've offset quantity with quality,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Families of 28 men killed in the
L'Ambiance Plaza building collapse and the 16 men who were injured
will share $30 million under a tentative $41 million settlement of
all lawsuits, a judge said Tuesday.
   Legal experts said the mediation process that led to the
agreement may have averted years of litigation and was unique
because of the number of lawsuits and potential lawsuits involved.
   U.S. District Judge Robert C. Zampano said he and a state
Superior Court judge, who together mediated talks leading to the
settlement, scheduled a hearing for final approval of the agreement
for Dec. 1.
   If all parties sign, it would end all litigation from the
collapse of the half-finished apartment building in Bridgeport on
April 23, 1987.
   ``I think we have a global settlement of all aspects of the
L'Ambiance building collapse and I feel very, very good,'' Zampano
said. ``All 40 defendants and potential defendants contributed (to
the settlement), which speaks of extraordinary cooperation.''
   ``No amount of money is going to replace what those people lost.
The only good thing is that it was done speedily,'' said Richard
Bieder, lead counsel for the plaintiffs.
   The proposed settlement didn't resolve the question of who was to
blame, although federal investigators placed the primary blame for
the accident on three contractors.
   Lawyers for all sides are reviewing documents drafted to
implement the settlement. Federal, state and probate judges, along
with two members of the state Workers Compensation Commission, also
will be asked to approve it, Zampano said.
   Under the settlement, the children of the men who died will
receive a weekly income until they are 30 years old and money for
college if they choose to go, Zampano said. The mediators wanted
them to be taken care of ``just as if their fathers had lived,'' he
said.
   Widows will receive income from annuities until they are 62 to 65
years old, when they will be eligible for Social Security, Zampano
said.
   Individual payments to victims and their heirs weren't released.
   Several legal experts commended the mediation process Zampano and
state Judge Frank S. Meadow organized.
   There were 92 attorneys involved representing victims' families
and workers, 40 companies involved in the project, the city of
Bridgeport and state and federal agencies.
   ``It's working concurrently to wrap the whole thing up in one
package that seems to me to be quite unusual and commendable,'' said
J.L. Pottenger, adjunct professor of law at Yale Law School.
   ``What is (unusual) is the size and scope of this case and the
potential number of parties and complexity of it,'' said James
Stapleton, president of the Connecticut Bar Association and a
Stamford attorney.
   Zampano and Meadow determined how much each victim should receive
by considering such factors as the age and health of the deceased or
injured, past wage history, earning capacity, age and income of
heirs, severity and degree of personal injuries, and life expectancy.
   In addition to the $30 million for the workers and their
families, the proposed settlement provides $11.25 million to settle
other claims, including those of contractors and insurance carriers
against one another, and to be used as reserve funds.
   A portion of the $30 million would be invested in annuities,
which are expected to generate an additional $20 million.
   The tentative settlement also includes provisions for the
rebuilding of L'Ambiance Plaza and the distribution to the
plaintiffs of some profits from the building for an undetermined
number of years.
   Still unresolved are $5.1 million in proposed federal fines
against five companies that worked on the project and accusations
that they violated federal safety rules.
   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman in Washington, D.C., said, ``I
can confirm that OSHA is in discussion with the court on a possible
settlement. There is no agreement at this point.''
   Zampano and Meadow said in their report that if OSHA demands full
payment of fines from the five companies, it could ``affect
seriously the contributions to the settlement fund.''

<TEXT>
   In asking Nicholas Brady to stay on as Treasury
secretary, George Bush has turned again to a long-time personal
friend to staff a key Cabinet post.
   Last week, Bush announced as his first Cabinet appointment his
choice of James A. Baker III to be secretary of state.
   While Baker is the better known because of his service with Bush
in the Reagan administration, Brady is just as close to the
president-elect.
   Earlier this year, Brady, Baker and another close Bush friend,
Houston oil millionaire Robert A. Mosbacher Sr., were dubbed the Big
Three in the Bush presidential campaign _ the longtime friends whose
counsel Bush listened to most often.
   There is speculation that Mosbacher may become Commerce secretary.
   With Bush's support, Brady, 58, got the nod from President Reagan
to become Treasury secretary when Baker announced in August that he
was leaving the administration to formally become chairman of the
Bush presidential campaign. Brady was sworn in as the nation's 68th
Treasury secretary on Sept. 15.
   In his first two months, Brady has adopted a low-key approach
which emphasized keeping the economy on track and avoiding any
controversy that might stir up financial markets before the Nov. 8
election.
   With the election over, Brady is expected to move just as
cautiously. Many are looking for Baker to continue to play a major
role in setting the economic as well as the foreign policy course
for the new administration.
   Many of Baker's major economic initiatives at Treasury were in
the foreign- policy area. It was Baker who three years ago launched
an initiative with major U.S. allies to coordinate economic policies
in an effort to lower America's huge foreign-trade deficit.
   That coordination had at its heart a sharp devaluation in the
value of the dollar, to stem a flood of foreign products into the
country by making them more expensive while reducing the cost of
American products on overseas markets.
   While the dollar devaluation has shown results, America and its
allies are now concerned that financial markets might push the
dollar down too far in value, raising the specter of higher interest
rates and a possible recession in this country.
   Even the mention last week by sometime Bush economic adviser
Martin Feldstein that the dollar needed to drop further to cure
America's trade problems was enough to send the greenback and the
stock market plunging.
   Brady issued a statement Monday that the administration was not
abandoning its committment to stabilize the value of the dollar and
his comments along with those of Bush during a beachside interview
calmed the markets. Experts are looking for no change from the Baker
policy in this area.
   On another international matter, Brady has voiced support for
Baker's plan to revitalize lending to Third World countries.
   However, the effort has fallen far short of expectations and many
believe that Japan, France and other countries will force the Bush
administration to acknowledge next year that more needs to be done
in the area of debt forgiveness.
   Events are also likely to force Brady to quickly address the
savings and loan crisis, where estimates of the cost of bailing out
hundreds of insolvent institutions have skyrocketed to between $50
billion and $100 billion. Brady has already appointed a Treasury
task force to study the problem.
   Another Treasury study group is looking at the capital gains tax
and this too is likely to be a priority in the new administration.
   Bush campaigned on a pledge to cut the capital gains tax, which
is levied on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other
investments. The top rate is 33 percent, the same as for salary
income, and Bush proposed cutting it to 15 percent, prompting the
charge from Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis that
such a cut represented a giveaway to the rich.
   Brady has discussed capital gains tax-reduction proposals with
top aides and reportedly favors the idea of a ``sliding-scale'' tax
that would allow the rate to decline the longer the asset had been
held.
   Brady is a millionaire whose upbringing and Ivy League education
closely resemble those of Bush.
   He entered Yale one year after Bush graduated. He went on to get
a masters degree in business at Harvard and then became an
investment banker in New York, spending an entire career since 1954
at Dillon, Read & Co., where he was known as a rainmaker, someone
who could attract big clients to the firm.
   Brady was appointed to serve out the Senate term of New Jersey
Democrat Harrison A. Williams Jr., who resigned in March 1982
following his conviction in the Abscam scandal.
   He did not seek election to the post but he remained active
politically as a troubleshooter for the Reagan administration,
serving in 1983 on three different advisory commissions _ on the MX
missile, Central America and foreign aid.
   When the stock market suffered its record plunge last year,
Reagan again turned to Brady, giving him the job of heading a White
House panel that investigated the market meltdown.
   He and the other task force members had only 60 days to figure
out what went wrong and recommend ways to fix it. One of the first
reports written on the crash, the Brady report is still widely
regarded as the best.
   The administration, however, almost immediately distanced itself
from Brady's main recommendation: a call for the Federal Reserve to
coordinate regulation of financial markets.
   But during his confirmation hearing in September, Brady hewed to
the administration's free-market line, saying he was satisfied with
the administration's approach, even though his own proposals were
much tougher.
   Brady was born in New York City in 1930 and grew up on a large
estate in Far Hills, N.J. His family's wealth gave him a substantial
start in business.
   His grandfather, who had arrived from Ireland during the mid-19th
century potato famine, started several electric utilities that later
became part of the Consolidated Edison Co. of New York.
   Brady's close friendship with Bush dates back to the early 1970s
when the two men became better acquainted through Bush's brother,
Jonathan. When Bush left the CIA in 1976, Brady tried to recuit him
as a partner at Dillon Read, but Bush turned down his friend's offer.

   A wind-whipped fire that started in large

   Joe Courtney, the city administrator, said the fire broke out
about noon in 40-foot-long storage modules filled with cotton on the
south side of the town. Some homes were reported on fire and a radio
station transmitter apparently burned in the blaze, Courtney said.
   Billowing clouds of smoke blanketed the town in far southwestern
Oklahoma.
   Fire units from as far away as Lawton, Okla., and Vernon, Texas,
were called in to help.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Joins Paula Cooper Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International filed a brief with the
Indiana Supreme Court on Tuesday in an effort to prevent the
execution of Paula Cooper, who was 15 when she was convicted of
killing a 78-year-old Bible teacher.
   The human rights watchdog group argued in its ``friend of the
court'' brief that putting Cooper to death would violate
internationally recognized standards of law against executing people
who were younger than 18 at the time of their crime.
   Cooper was convicted in 1985 of killing Ruth Pelke.
   Michael Sutherlin, coordinator of the Indiana lawyers who belong
to Amnesty International, said Indiana's recently revised death
penalty statute, which raised from 10 to 16 the age at which a
person could be executed, should be applied to the Cooper case.
   ``Any beneficial change in the law that would make punishment
more lenient should be applied retroactively,'' said Sutherlin.
   Ten juvenile females have been executed in Indiana since 1676,
the last in 1912, Sutherlin said.
   ``Surely we have become a more civilized nation since 1912,'' he
said.
   The Cooper case is in the first stage of review by the state
Supreme Court. If appeals through the state courts fail to overturn
her sentence, she could pursue an appeal through the federal courts.
   No execution date has been set for Cooper, now an inmate at the
Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis.

   No change will be made in the announced
requirement that farmers will have to idle 10 percent of their feed
grain base acreage to qualify for price supports and other benefits
next year, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the 10 percent acreage
reduction program, or ARP, for 1989 was announced on Sept. 30. But
the law also authorizes further adjustments by Nov. 15 if the
prospective total supply of corn and other feed grains changes
significantly.
   The 10 percent reduction applies to 1989 crops of corn, sorghum
and barley, which carried a 20 percent ARP this year. The ARP for
oats will be 5 percent, unchanged from 1988.

   The Soviets broke the U.S. monopoly on reusable
spacecraft Tuesday by launching their own space shuttle on a
3{-hour, unmanned orbital flight that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
hailed as a major coup for his country.
   ``The space plane has ushered in a new era in the history of
Soviet space exploration,'' state-run Radio Moscow declared after
the 100-ton Buran made two orbits, streaked earthward in a fireball
and landed at a specially  Sharp, told officers she asked him to
mislead them. Police affadavits said Sharp handed a detective a note
that said, ``She's making me lie.''
   Sharp later told police that one resident disappeared after he
had caused a drunken ruckus and ``Dorothea told him that she would
take him upstairs and make him better.'' About four days later,
police said, Sharp ``smelled a very strong odor of what he thought
was death in the kitchen area.'' Puente told him the stench was
caused by faulty sewers.
   Police previously had estimated that ``seven or eight'' victims
may be buried at the home, but they have received numerous inquiries
from people who say they also have relatives who were once tenants
at the rooming house and have since disappeared.
   The warrant signed by a Municipal Court judge charged Puente only
with the slaying of Alvaro Montoya, a mentally disabled transient
who lived in the boarding house. Authorities, however, refused to
say they had identified any of the bodies as being Montoya.
   Authorities have arrested tenant John McCauley, 59, on
investigation of being an accessory after the fact to murder. Burns
said detectives believe McCauley helped dig the graves.

<HEAD>Study Finds New Evidence That Pakistan Has Nukes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is ``convincing evidence'' Pakistan has
finally developed atomic weapons, leading to the possibility of a
nuclear arms race with its long-time enemy India, according to a
study published Tuesday.
   Pakistan has not tested any atomic weapons and continues to deny
it has built them, a public stance similar to three other countries
which are also believed to have nuclear weapons, the study said. The
others are India, Israel, and South Africa.
   ``Between 1986 and 1988, after a decade of slow advances,
Pakistan appears to have become the fourth country to join this
group of unannounced, de facto nuclear powers,'' said the report by
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   The review was the fourth such recent survey published by the
non-profit group, which specializes in national security issues. It
was written by Leonard S. Spector, author of the previous reports.
Spector formerly worked on non-proliferation issues at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
non-proliferation subcommittee.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said he had no
comment on the findings.
   Five nations have said they have nuclear weapons: the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Great Britain and France. India
exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a
non-military explosion.
   Efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have
focused on the Middle East and South Asia, the report noted.
Pakistan and India are the chief source of concern, since the two
countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were
created by the separation of colonial India from Britain.
   The evidence that Pakistan has the bomb includes production of
highly enriched uranium, a key component of atomic weapons; and
European reports of a previously clandestine effort by Pakistan
officials to smuggle sophisticated nuclear components out of West
Germany, the report said.
   Pakistan may be capable of producing two to four atomic weapons,
Spector said. ``India responded to this challenge by continuing the
quiet expansion of its nuclear weapons capabilities _ which far
overshadow Pakistan's _ while maintaining an ambiguous public stance
concerning its nuclear intentions.''
   A future war between the two enemies could be devastating, the
report said. ``It has been estimated that a dozen nuclear weapons
used against military targets in India or Pakistan could cause over
a million casualties.''
   The Pakistani program is a dilemma for the United States, Spector
said, noting Pakistan is a prime recipient of U.S. aid at the same
time U.S. officials are pushing Pakistan not to develop atomic
weapons.
   Two years ago, President Reagan told Congress that Pakistan did
not possess nuclear weapons, a certification required by Capitol
Hill before the U.S. aid program could go ahead. But in recent
months, U.S. officials have been less direct in asserting that the
Pakistanis don't have atomic weapons.
   President-elect George Bush has shown more of an interest in
stopping the spread of atomic weapons in South Asia, Spector said.
``I think it may get more attention in a Bush administration,'' he
said.
   Spector suggested U.S. policy should be aimed at developing
``some sort of mechanism, some kind of regional arrangement, to
bring India and Pakistan into negotiations. The concept is to find a
way to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves. It will be
difficult.''
   The report also said Israel has ``a substantial, undeclared
nuclear arsenal,'' which includes more sophisticated weapons than
previously thought. Specter explained that there are indications the
Israelis have some bombs based on thermonuclear _ fusion _
principles, which are more powerful than fission weapons.
   The Israelis have never admitted possessing nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>NYC FBI Agents Get Big Pay Boost In Demonstration Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents in New York City have been given a
25 percent pay increase _ more than six times the raise for agents
elsewhere _ in an effort to solve a staffing crisis there.
   As part of the same, five-year ``demonstration project'' to
entice agents and staffers to work in New York, those who agree to
move to the nation's largest city for specified periods also will
receive lump-sum bonuses of $20,000.
   The pay increases were set up by the Intelligence Authorization
Act for fiscal 1989, which was signed into law Sept. 29.
   The FBI made no public announcement when the project became law,
even though it had been trying for several years to find a mechanism
to raise salaries in the New York field office.
   Some 300 jobs are vacant because bureau pay has not kept pace
with the city's cost of living, particularly housing. The
resignation rate in the field office had been running at about 4
percent annually.
   So while FBI agents elsewhere in America receive an average base
salary of $39,000 a year, New York agents at that level got raises
to $48,750 on Oct. 23, FBI spokesman Gregory Jones said Monday. FBI
agents and staffers in other offices will receive the same 4.1
percent raise that other federal workers will get on Jan. 1.
   Jones said it was too soon to tell whether the lump-sum offer had
attracted any volunteers to work in New York.
   FBI Director William Sessions said last week he thought the pay
increase would solve the problem in the New York office _ the FBI's
largest, with more than 1,200 agents and 900 support workers. The
pay boost affects all agents and about two-thirds of the support
staff _ namely those workers who are subject to mandatory transfers,
according to the law.

<HEAD>Case Dropped Against Women Accused of Taking $50,000 From Ill
Patient</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nurse's aide accused of draining $50,000
from an 84-year-old patient's bank accounts and of neglect that may
have contributed to his death will keep the money and avoid trial
because prosecutors say they have no case.
   Seminole-Brevard State Attorney Norman Wolfinger said Monday he
lacks evidence to prosecute Patricia VanDyke, 42, on charges of
grand theft and exploitation of the elderly.
   Ms. VanDyke, who is free on $2,000 bond and lives in a Sanford
mobile home she bought with George Reek's money, said Monday she has
been vindicated.
   The investigator who ran the case, however, said prosecutors have
plenty of evidence.
   ``If I didn't feel that I had a case, I wouldn't have directed
the investigator to go over and arrest the woman,'' said Seminole
sheriff's Sgt. Steve Walthers. ``She broke the law and she needs to
be prosecuted.''
   And a state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
counselor, Harry McLaulin, said in a March 3 report that Ms. VanDyke
exploited and neglected Reek.
   ``There are reasons to believe that said neglect directly
contributed to Mr. Reek's death,'' he said. Reek died March 22 of
tuberculosis.
   The day Ms. VanDyke gained control of Reek's accounts, she
withdrew $38,000. She withdrew $6,000 the next day, sheriff's
reports show. Detectives say a total of $91,000 is missing from
Reek's estate. They traced $50,000 to Ms. VanDyke and charged her
May 10.
   Florida's speedy-trial law requires that people charged with
felonies go to trial within 175 days of their arrest. The deadline
for Ms. VanDyke's trial passed Nov. 1, meaning she can petition to
have the case dismissed. She said Tuesday she would file a petition
within a few days.
   Wolfinger could fight the petition, but would have to try Ms.
VanDyke within 15 days.
   Ms. VanDyke said she took the money because Reek wanted her to
have it.
   ``We loved each other. I took care of him,'' she said. ``I cry
every day because I loved that man so much. I loved that man more
than anything in the world. I love working with elderly people.''

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of manslaughter has been
ordered to spend New Year's Eve trying to prevent the kind of
tragedy that occurred last Dec. 31 when his stroke-of-midnight
gunshot killed a young woman.
   Ellis Pryor, 52, won't be sentenced until late January for the
shooting that neighbors say still haunts him. But Common Pleas Judge
Lisa Richette on Monday directed him to guard his North Philadelphia
block from reckless New Year's Eve gunfire.
   Pryor was shooting a semi-automatic gun into the air at midnight
last New Year's Eve when he staggered and misfired, killing Yvonne
Hunter, 18, while she stood on a nearby porch, Assistant District
Attorney Carolyn Short said. The prosecutor said she will ask for a
five- to 10-year prison sentence for Pryor.
   ``You are appointed captain of that block for the purpose of
discouraging and persuading everybody not to shoot live bullets,''
the judge told Pryor. ``If one live bullet does get fired, I'm
holding you responsible.''
   ``I want you patrolling that block. This will be your way of
redeeming yourself.''
   ``It was a good (order),'' Pryor's wife, Mary, told the
Philadelphia Daily News. ``I guess with his past and everyone
knowing him, they thought that was a good thing to do.''
   Pryor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, reckless
endangerment and weapons offenses in connection with Ms. Hunter's
death.
   Neighbors said Pryor, who has several children and grandchildren,
has been haunted by the slaying and has not been able to sleep well
since.
   ``He has suffered tremendously,'' said Jo Ann Graham, 42, who has
lived next door to the Pryors for more than 20 years. ``He feels
awful, because she was so young. He's not a man without a
conscience.''
   ``On this block, I feel almost certain that we won't hear any
gunshots,'' Ms. Graham said. ``Everyone knew the young girl, and we
all knew the Pryors. It was devastating. Of course, he realizes he
was wrong.''
   Ms. Hunter ``had went visiting on New Year's Eve, and she was
going to come home at midnight to wish her mother Happy New Year,''
said neighbor Essie Haskins, 80. ``She got as far as the porch where
she was visiting and that's when it happened.''
   The judge told Pryor his street has been ``traumatized by this
death.''
   ``This was outrageous,'' she said. ``This was irresponsible,
immature and reckless. You are lucky only one person was killed.''

said schools Superintendent Gary Livingston.
   There were reports of damage to homes in the southwest part of
the city, and to the Westridge Mall. There were reports of cars
overturned at the shopping mall.
   A number of power lines were down.
   ``We had two to three reports of tornadoes on the ground,'' said
a Shawnee County sheriff's deputy who hung up the phone to take

services outside the United States and administration of AP's
foreign bureaus.
   A native New Yorker, Doelling was graduated from the City College
of New York and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
He began his reporting career at the Gainesville (Fla.) Sun and
later became an associate editor for Army Times in West Germany.

<HEAD>Bail of Eight Defendants Revoked as Treason Trial Comes to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday revoked the bail of
eight defendants as he prepared to deliver the verdict in a
three-year trial of the leaders of South Africa's biggest
anti-apartheid group.
   The 19 black defendants, who belong to the banned United
Democratic Front, have pleaded innocent to charges of treason,
terrorism, murder and subversion related to an allegation that they
sought to promote violence in order to make South Africa
ungovernable.
   Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst began delivering a
summary of the trial and is expected to announce the verdicts in two
or three days.
   Sixteen of the 19 black defendants had been granted bail during
the trial. Van Dijkhorst did not explain why he revoked the bail of
only eight defendants. The three most prominent defendants _ senior
leaders of the United Democratic Front _ have been denied bail and
have spent 40 months in jail. They are Popo Molefe, 36, who was the
United Democratic Front's national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, who
was its publicity secretary, and Moses Chikane, 40, who was
secretary of its Transvaal Province branch.
   The United Democratic Front, South Africa's largest opposition
group, was founded in 1983 and includes more than 600 anti-apartheid
groups with about 2 million members. It was banned in February.
   The charges against the 19 arise from violence and mob killings
in black townships south of Johannesburg in September 1984 that were
the start of two years of nationwide unrest in which more than 2,500
people were killed.
   Treason and murder carry a maximum penalty of death.
   Van Dijkhorst, who has presided over the non-jury trial since it
began in June 1985, has sole responsibility for the verdict and
sentencing. He was initially assisted by two lay experts, but one
was dismissed because he had signed a petition supported by the
United Democratic Front opposing constitutional changes that
excluded blacks from Parliament.
   Van Dijkhorst said Tuesday the defendants were not being
prosecuted for their political views. He said it was possible to
commit treason even if one believed a new government would serve the
interests of a majority of the people.
   Under South Africa's policy of apartheid, the 26 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5
million whites.

   Retired Army Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was buried with full military
honors Tuesday in Arlington National Cemetery.
   Internment came after a private funeral service at the Old Post
Chapel of Fort Myer, Va., near the Pentagon.
   Lemnitzer, who died Saturday morning at age 89, was buried near
the main entrance of the cemetery, next to Gen. Omar N. Bradley and
near the gravesite of President William Howard Taft.
   After the funeral ceremony, units representing the Army, Marines,
Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard led a procession to the gravesite,
followed by the casket on a caisson and a riderless horse with boots
placed backwards in the stirrups, a symbol of a fallen leader.
   At the conclusion of the interment service, a 17-gun salute was
fired by members of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Salute Guns Platoon.
   Lemnitzer was also given three volleys from the rifles of an Army
unit. After the playing of ``Taps,'' the U.S. flag on Lemnitzer's
casket was folded and presented to Katherine Lemnitzer, the
general's widow, by Maj. Gen. Donald C. Hilbert, commanding general
of the Military District of Washington.
   Honorary pallbearers included retired military leaders Gen.
Bernard W. Rogers, Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster, Adm. Thomas H. Moorer,
Lt. Gen. Edward L. Rowny and Maj. Gen. James A. Grimsley Jr.
   In addition to serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
in 1960, Lemnitzer was NATO commander in 1962, a former Army chief
of staff and combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War.

<HEAD>Panel Offers No Hints On Bases To Be Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special commission created to identify
unneeded military bases for closure met a congressional deadline on
Tuesday for describing its ``evaluation process,'' but dropped no
hints about individual bases that might end up on its hit list.
   The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure, in a 2{-page
statement, outlined a five-step process ``for the evaluation of
major military installations within the United States, its
territories, commonwealths and possessions.''
   ``We're going to be running everything under the microscope, and
this simply explains how,'' said Jim Abbee, a spokesman for the
panel.
   ``You can't make any inference from this that any base is or is
not likely to be recommended for closure. You'll have to wait until
Dec. 31 for that.''
   Legislation signed by President Reagan last month authorized the
12-member citizens' commission to review the nation's military bases
and to decide which are outmoded and can be closed, at a projected
annual savings of $2 billion to $5 billion.
   The panel has until Dec. 31 to report its findings to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who may forward the list to Congress if
he wishes. Should he decide to do so, Congress can veto the entire
list but cannot act to protect individual bases, as it often has in
the past.
   The ``all-or-nothing'' legal procedure is viewed as offering the
best chance in more than a decade to actually close unneeded
military bases over the objection of local congressmen.
   According to Tuesday's statement, the commission is first
grouping together ``by mission'' the military facilities across the
country; for example, all Army depots, all Air Force fighter bases,
all Navy submarine ports.
   ``The second step will evaluate bases within the category to
determine whether additional mission capacity exists beyond current,
future or mobilization requirements,'' the panel added.
   After reviewing overall capacity, the commission said it would
begin evaluating each individual base on five factors: mission
suitability, including geographical environment and ease of
deployment; the physical facilities in place; the quality of those
facilities; the quality of life for personnel such as housing, and
community support.
   The bases that rank at the bottom of each ``mission'' list will
then be considered for closure by determining if other bases higher
on the list are in a position to become ``receiving'' bases, the
panel added.
   ``The combination of possible realignments and the closing of the
base will be considered as a package for cost evaluation ...,'' the
statement says.
   In the final step, the ``package'' of a ``closing base'' and ``a
receiving base'' will be reviewed for environmental concerns such as
hazardous waste problems and for socio-economic impact ``in the form
of evaluation of the potential closure's impact on local
employment.''
   Abbee said the commission is in the midst of applying the
procedure to 871 large military facilities. He declined to predict
how many of them might end up on the recommended closure list.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional 1.2
million metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery in the 1988-89
marketing year that began on Sept. 1, the Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for
1988-89 to more than 5.9 million tons. Last year, U.S. corn sales to
the Soviet Union totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.2 million tons
of corn would be about 47.3 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.55 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $120 million.

<HEAD>ABC Launches `War and Remembrance,' But NBC Wins Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first episode of ``War and Remembrance,'' the
opening salvo from ABC's big gun in the November ratings war, placed
fourth in the weekly Nielsens, not good enough to prevent NBC from
winning the week.
   The No. 1 show of the week was a one-hour episode of NBC's ``The
Cosby Show'' in which Cliff and Clair became grandparents. It had a
30.3 rating and a 47 share, the highest-rated ``Cosby'' since last
March.
   NBC dominated the top 10 and won the week ending Nov. 12 with an
average, prime-time rating of 15.6. ABC was second with 14.0 and CBS
third with 11.5.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with television. The share
is a percentage of sets in use.
   ``War and Remembrance'' opened Sunday with a 21.8 rating and a 31
share. The national rating, released Tuesday, was lower than the
17-city overnights available Monday. The first installment's rating
reportedly met ABC's guarantee to sponsors, but the network was
somewhat disappointed since ratings for multi-episode miniseries
often start and finish at a high but sag in the middle.
   The miniseries is a sequel to ``The Winds of War,'' which opened
in 1983 with a rating of 39.1 and a 53 share.
   ``War and Remembrance'' runs 18 hours in seven parts, but the
story doesn't conclude until sometime next year when ABC is
scheduled to run the rest of the 32-hour World War II saga.
   Because of delays in its other programming due to the writers'
strike, ABC rushed the first part of the miniseries to air this
month, one of four ratings ``sweeps'' periods each year when network
affiliate ratings are measured. Originally the entire 32 hours was
to have run in 1989.
   The 10 top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show,''
``Cheers'' and ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``War and Remembrance,'' ABC;
``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Growing Pains,'' ABC; ``Empty Nest,'' ``L.A.
Law'' and ``Dear John,'' all NBC.
   The theatrical film ``Back to the Future,'' which NBC ran against
``War and Remembrance'' on Sunday, placed 11th.
   The only new shows to make the top 20 were NBC's ``Empty Nest,''
``Dear John'' and ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   CBS' new comedies were in trouble. Mary Tyler Moore's ``Annie
McGuire'' and Dick Van Dyke's ``The Van Dyke Show,'' plus ``Dirty
Dancing'' and ``Raising Miranda,'' were among the 10 lowest-rated
network shows of the week.
   ABC's ``Knightwatch'' had an inauspicious premiere in
second-to-last place.
   The bottom 10 were: CBS' election-night coverage, ``Police
Story,'' ``Annie McGuire,'' ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``National Love and
Sex Test,'' ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Simon & Simon,''
``Knightwatch'' and ``Raising Miranda.''
   In news, the three networks finished in a virtual dead heat.
``CBS Evening News'' and ``ABC World News Tonight'' had a rating of
10.7 and a share of 19, barely ahead of ``NBC Nightly News'' with a
10.5 rating and 19 share.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Major Overhaul of Wetlands Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government-sponsored panel of diverging
interests on Tuesday recommended a major overhaul of wetlands
protection, with states assuming responsibility for a national goal
of creating more wetlands than are being destroyed.
   The National Wetlands Policy Forum, convened by the Conservation
Foundation at the request of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said the proposed goal of ending the conversion of wetlands to other
uses did not mean every single parcel of marshy ground would have to
be preserved, but enough wetlands should be created or restored to
outweigh the losses.
   ``The federal government has hundreds of wetlands rules, but
there is no guiding principle, no overriding goal,'' said New Jersey
Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who served as chairman of the forum. ``The
result is confusion equal to rush hour on the beltway.''
   The 20-member forum embraced representatives of builders,
industry, environmental groups, state and local governments and
federal agencies. Its recommendations were presented as a consensus
package, and Kean and others said the group would oppose attempts to
pick out particular measures from the more than 100 recommendations
to support or oppose.
   About half the 200 million acres of marshes and bogs, fens,
swamps and other wetlands that were present in the lower 48 states
when European settlement began have been converted to other uses _
farms, housing developments, shopping centers, airports and
everything else that humans do.
   In recent decades, though, environmental benefits of wetlands
have been recognized increasingly: storage of flood water, cleansing
of pollution, protection of wildlife, spawning and nursing of 60
percent to 90 percent of the nation's commercial fish catch,
recharging groundwater and controlling erosion.
   A major study in the 1970s estimated that losses over the two
previous decades had proceeded at 400,000 acres _ half the size of
Rhode Island _ to 500,000 acres per year. No one knows if that still
holds true. EPA uses 350,000 acres and a recent congressional study
used 275,000 acres.
   Among major recommendations of the forum:
   _A national agricultural wetlands reserve which would pay farmers
to transfer land or easements to wetlands preservation trusts. These
trusts would operate somewhat like the Nature Conservancy and other
private groups to hold reserved land. The reserve should aim to
protect 5 million existing acres and restore half as much, the forum
said.
   _Each state should enact wetlands protection plans which, if
approved by EPA, would qualify the state to take over many, though
not all, of EPA's wetlands protection jobs. Only Michigan has taken
over EPA wetland regulation tasks so far.
   _States with approved programs might be able to issue ``regional
general permits which would allow the conversion of a limited amount
of ecologically low value wetland areas in exchange for full
compensatory mitigation.''
   _Federal activities would have to be consistent with approved
state plans, just as they now must be in states with approved
Coastal Zone Management plans.
   _``Regulatory authorities should take any necessary action,
including amending existing regulations, to prevent the willful
alteration of wetland characteristics to circumvent regulatory
jurisdictions.''
   _Make the definitions of wetlands uniform. Some 50 different
definitions of wetlands are in use throughout the federal government.
   _A major effort to identify public lands where wetlands could be
restored, with priority attention to the Louisiana coast's
``extremely high wetlands losses from erosion and subsidence,
largely as a result of government flood control and other water
resource projects.''
   The report noted, ``The fact that the protection of wetlands
makes good economic as well as environmental sense for society but
not necessarily for the individual owning them is central to much of
the conflict over wetlands protection policies,'' and a conservative
advocacy group singled out that point as one weakness.
   ``Property owners have a right to develop their property,'' said
Robin L. Rivett of the Pacific Legal Foundation of Sacramento,
Calif., adding that ``there is no mention in this report of the
Fifth Amendment problem.''
   He referred to court rulings that some land use regulations can
be so burdensome as to amount to a ``taking'' of property for public
use that requires compensation to the owner under the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment.
   Tom Hookano of the foundation said the group believes major
wetlands need protection, but he said the report does not go beyond
recommendations of the regulatory task force chaired by Vice
President George Bush in 1982.
   ``It's irresponsible to recommend a program without a price
tag,'' he said, arguing that the agricultural wetlands reserve could
cost billions of dollars.
   The National Audubon Society and the National Wildlife
Federation, whose leaders took part in the study, endorsed the
report, but one environmental group that did not participate said it
had ``serious concerns about delegating authority to the states''
because state and local governments were more vulnerable to pressure
from development interests than the federal government.''
   Dave Malakoff of Friends of the Earth said, ``We're suspicious of
state control. We're not sure the states have the resources to
regulate in this area.''

   The financial markets were hoping for good news Wednesday with
the release of the merchandise trade balance for September. Most
economists expect a decline in imports to narrow the trade gap to
$10.5 billion from the $12.2 billion August deficit. If the deficit
exceeds that amount, market analysts fear it could trigger a selloff
in the dollar, stock and bond markets.
   Meanwhile, there were these developments in the economic picture
Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.09 points to
2,077.17 in a particularly slow session, reflecting widespread
reluctance to participate ahead of the monthly trade report.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose 0.9 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted
$135.6 billion, the strongest increase in seven months. Sales
figures are not adjusted for inflation and many of the increases can
be attributed to higher prices.
   For the first 10 months of the year, overall sales were up 6.1
percent over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the
inflation rate.

<HEAD>INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose
0.4 percent in October, the strongest increase in three months. It
followed smaller increases of 0.2 percent in September and 0.3
percent in August, and a big jump of 1.1 percent in July.

   Malaysia is studying whether to
participate in the Soviet Union's space program, a move that would
cost $10 million, a government official said Tuesday.
   Considering the cost, Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Amar Stephen Yong said the matter needed further study, as
well as Cabinet approval.
   There are 22 Malaysian applicants to fly in space, and four would
be selected for further training to become a cosmonaut, he said.
   ``We have to ascertain whether our participation in the program
would benefit the nation in any way and therefore a detailed study
was necessary,'' he said.

   Slightly radioactive water spilled at
the Oyster Creek nuclear plant Tuesday, forcing officials to declare
the lowest of four emergency categories.
   Nobody was contaminated and no injuries were reported, said plant
spokesman Sandy Polon.
   The water spilled onto a reactor floor when a seal that is
normally used to cap the flow failed during maintenance, Polon said.
   About six employees were working on the device when the water
spilled.
   The accident prompted declaration of an ``unusual event,''
because water flow exceeded the normal 25 gallons per minute, Polon
said, estimating the flow at between 25 and 50 gallons per minute.
   The declaration, the lowest of four emergency categories, began
at 2:40 a.m. and ended at 4:30 a.m., Polon said.
   About 10,000 gallons of water were collected before repairs were
completed, Polon said. The water went into the plant's drainage
system, where it was recirculated.
   Oyster Creek has been shut down since Sept. 29 for maintenance
and refueling. There is no fuel in the reactor.

<HEAD>Thousands March For Peace In Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of peasants, students
and workers marched through the capital Tuesday to demand that the
U.S.-backed government negotiate with leftist rebels to end the
9-year-old civil war.
   The march coincided with a meeting of the General Assembly of the
Organization of American States. Peace in Central America is among
the topics being discussed during the week-long meeting of delegates
from 31 nations.
   An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people marched in the procession
that stretched more than 2 miles. Protesters walked from the city's
eastern edge to the hotel where the OAS meeting is being held in
western San Salvador.
   ``The struggle for peace is the duty of all!'' chanted the
marchers beneath hundreds of blue-and-white Salvadoran flags, white
flags symbolyzing peace and banners with slogans demanding an end to
the bloodshed.
   Organizers of the event, including dozens of anti-government
labor, peasant, student, church and human rights organizations,
called it ``The Great March for Peace and a Political Solution to
the Conflict.''
   Participants represented a cross-section of Salvadoran society,
with straw-hatted, sandaled peasants walking alongside factory
workers and neatly attired white-collar workers.
   The Salvadoran armed forces, battling a Marxist-led insurgency,
had said the march was part of a guerrilla plan to disrupt the
capital during the OAS meeting. The army also accused organizers of
seeking to provoke government forces.
   But the march was peaceful as both armed forces and demonstrators
apparently made efforts to avoid violence.
   Troops and police took up positions a few blocks from the
Sheraton Hotel, where the OAS is meeting, to prevent the marchers
from reaching the general assembly site. Instead, demonstrators
gathered at a nearby traffic circle where they sang songs and
listened to speeches.
   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   The centrist government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte demands
that the guerrillas lay down their arms and incorporate themselves
into the democratic process.
   The guerrillas and their civilian political supporters contend
Duarte's government is a facade for military domination and that
elections have been a farce.
   The guerrillas last week declared a unilateral truce for the
duration of the OAS meeting and renewed a call for negotiations with
the government.
   The army rejected the move as propaganda, and on Tuesday, the
Armed Forces Press Office said the rebels violated their cease-fire
by shooting at government forces.
   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, the
rebels charged the army with ``provocation,'' and said any fighting
was the result of army offensive action.
   Three rounds of government-rebel negotiations in recent years
have been fruitless.
   ``The government has not demonstrated sincerity in previous
negotiations,'' said an Episcopal Church worker taking part in the
march. ``But negotiation is the only way. By pursuing military
means, there will only be more dead.''
   He declined to be identified. Activists in El Salvador are
reluctant to be quoted by name. In the early 1980s, soldiers and
death squads linked to the military were blamed for the kidnap and
murder of thousands of suspected leftists.
   Duarte, in his address Monday to OAS delegates, said the
guerrillas' expressed desire to resume negotiations was merely
``tactical.'' He accused the rebels of pursuing ``a strategic
maneuver to destroy democracy through democracy's own liberties.''

   With AIDS increasingly striking women, those
women at highest risk of exposure should make extradordinary efforts
to avoid contracting the deadly disease, even if that means possible
abandonment, physical harm or never having children, a private study
said Tuesday.
   The report from the Women's Research & Education Institution,
``The American Woman, 1988-1989,'' noted that AIDS is growing faster
among women than among men or children.
   Figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control show the
number of AIDS cases rose 106.1 percent for women from 1987 to 1988,
49.5 percent for children and 31.4 percent for men.
   To combat this rapid increase, the new report _ a compilation of
existing studies _ said programs aimed at educating those most at
risk are ``imperative,'' even if the consequence of knowledge is the
serious disruption of lives.
   The study said those most at risk are intravenous drug users and
sexual partners of male intravenous drug users and bisexual men.
   Yet many of these vulnerable women, the report said, don't know
the danger they are in because they do not realize that the behavior
of their sex partners puts them at high risk of contracting AIDS or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   And some women trying to avoid contracting AIDS face additional
problems.
   ``For a woman to take the steps necessary to avoid sexual and
perinatal transmission of AIDS may mean risking rejection,
abandonment, even physical harm at the hands of her partner, and the
disruption of sexual and@or family relationships,'' the report
said. ``In some cases, it may mean the decision not to have
children.''
   To educate these women, the report said, they often must first be
persuaded ``that their lives are worth saving and that it is within
their power to prevent the deadly disease'' from infecting them.
   Only when these women, who often feel helpless and depressed over
their lives, believe their actions will make a difference can
traditional AIDS-education programs have a real impact, the report
said.
   The CDC estimated that 2,839 women were diagnosed with AIDS
during the first 11 months of 1988, compared with 1,377 for the same
period a year earlier. For men, the comparable numbers were 24,538
and 18,674; for children 474 and 317.
   Worse than the numbers themselves, the report noted, was an
assessment by the CDC that there are 50 times to 80 times as many
women who are infected with the precusor virus to AIDS as have been
diagnosed with the disease itself.
   The 443-page book, which addresses issues ranging from the
presence of women in politics to women's progress in law
enforcement, was prepared as a challenge to the new administration
of President-elect George Bush.
   Sara E. Rix, the report's editor, said she was encouraged by
Bush's vision of a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
   ``He can change the dream into reality by supporting the needs of
women,'' Rix told a news conference.
   One area needing change, the report said, is the quality of
health care offered women with limited choices.
   The report said that ``a country as prosperous and ingenious as
this one is should not tolerate the great disparities that exist
between men and women, between the poor and the non-poor, and
between whites and minorities in something so vital and basic as
health care.''
   The report also said:
   _Of the 37 million Americans without health insurance, women are
most vulnerable.
   _The poverty rate is higher among women, especially older women,
and they must rely on inadequate public programs.
   _Life expectancy for women has increased rapidly, from 73.1 years
for females born in 1960 to 78.2 years for women born in 1985.
   The book was published by W.W. Norton for the institute, which is
a non-partisan research arm of the Congressional Caucus for Women's
Issues.

   Margaret Thatcher arrives here Tuesday to take
nostalgic leave of President Reagan and size up his successor,
George Bush, whom she has called a symbol of ``all that is best in
America.''
   ``She wants to stress the forward-looking aspects of relations as
well as taking a backward look,'' said British Embassy spokesman
Michael Price.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, will call on Reagan on Wednesday for a
three-hour visit summing up an extraordinary eight-year relationship
that was both a personal friendship and a mutually supportive
diplomatic alliance.
   The two leaders, who last met when Reagan stopped by in London in
June on his way home from Moscow, also are expected to map out plans
for their meetings next month with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
in New York and London, respectively.
   The White House visit will be followed by a lavish gala dinner in
Mrs. Thatcher's honor _ the last such state dinner the Reagans will
host before the president leaves office Jan. 20.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher will meet with President-elect Bush to
talk about priorities for future arms control negotiations with the
Soviets, the American trade and budget deficits which have upset
international financial markets and prospects for resolving the
Arab-Israeli conflict, said Price.
   ``The Middle East will be high on the agenda,'' Price said.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Bush will discuss the latest developments in
that troubled area, including this week's Palestine National Council
declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the council's
renunciation of terrorism.
   Bush has pledged to commit his administration to the search for a
solution in the seemingly intractable dispute. Mrs. Thatcher, along
with other European allies, long have urged the United States to
pressure its ally Israel into negotiations with the Palestine
Liberation Organization if it recognizes Israel and forswears
terrorism.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, who is the longest-serving Western leader with
nine years in office, has meet Bush numerous times in his role as
vice president.
   ``We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of unrivaled
experience and we respect him because he stands for all that is best
in America,'' she said before leaving London.
   Barring unforeseen events, Mrs. Thatcher will be in office
through almost all of Bush's tenure.
   The deficit problem, as well as U.S. concern about the
integration of the European Economic Community in 1992, also will
come up at Mrs. Thatcher's meeting with Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve.
   Mrs. Thatcher will receive Greenspan, as well as Soviet physicist
Andrei Sakharov, at Blair House, the official White House guest
quarters. She is the first leader to stay in the 19th-century
mansion since it was shut down six years ago for extensive
renovations.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who was last here in July 1987, also is scheduled
to hold talks with Secretary of State George Shultz before flying
home Thursday.

<HEAD>Ahearn Named Executive Editor; Mears Returns to Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William E. Ahearn, managing editor of The
Associated Press, was appointed executive editor Tuesday, to succeed
Walter R. Mears, who will become Washington vice president and a
political columnist for the news cooperative.
   President Louis D. Boccardi announced the appointments, effective
Jan. 1, 1989.
   Ahearn's successor as managing editor will be Martin C. Thompson,
who has been AP chief of bureau in Los Angeles.
   Mears, whose Washington career spanned 23 years before he became
executive editor, asked to return to the capital and to the
political writing that was his specialty.
   Boccardi said the change was in line with a plan established when
Mears came to New York five years ago.
   ``He has been a great help to me and an asset to the AP in his
time here, and he will continue those contributions from the city
that has been his professional home,'' the AP president said.
   Mears, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977 for his political
reporting, will write three analytical columns a week for the AP in
the new assignment.
   Charles J. Lewis remains in his post as Washington bureau chief.
   Boccardi also announced that Charles J. Hanley, who has been
assistant managing editor, will become deputy managing editor.
   Julie Dunlap was named assistant managing editor@features, and
Mike Silverman was appointed assistant managing editor@national
news.
   Mears, 53, became executive editor in January 1984, after serving
as Washington bureau chief for seven years. He has been an AP
special correspondent since 1975 and a vice president since 1978. He
first joined the AP in Boston in 1955 while still a Middlebury
College student, returned in 1956 and became Montpelier, Vt.,
correspondent later that year. Mears was reassigned to Boston in
1960 and transferred to Washington in 1961.
   Ahearn, 45, has been managing editor since 1985. He joined the AP
in 1971 in New York as a broadcast news writer after serving with
the Army as an infantry officer in Vietnam. Ahearn moved to the New
York General Desk, the AP's main news desk, in 1972. He was named
enterprise editor in 1979 and assistant managing editor in 1981.
   He was graduated from the University of Bridgeport in 1965,
worked as a copy editor on the Bridgeport Post-Telegram, then
attended graduate school at Boston University.
   Thompson, 50, has been chief of bureau in Los Angeles since 1986.
He was chief of bureau in San Francisco for 11 years prior to that.
He joined the AP in Seattle in 1966; was named correspondent in
Reno, Nev., in 1968; and then transferred to the AP's San Francisco
bureau in 1970 where he served as news editor.
   Thompson joined the AP after serving as a newsman for radio
station KEDO in Longview, Wash., and then was news director of radio
station KREW in Sunnyside, Wash. Thompson is a 1960 graduate of the
University of Washington.
   Hanley, 41, joined the AP in Albany following graduation from St.
Bonaventure University. He transferred to the Foreign Desk in New
York in 1976 where he was an editor and a special writer who
traveled extensively on foreign assignments. He was named assistant
managing editor in 1987.
   Dunlap, 40, has been the AP's senior feature editor for six
years. She joined the AP in Philadelphia in 1974 and transferred to
the General Desk two years later. Following a year as an editor at
The New York Times, she returned to the AP and became
enterprise-special assignments editor with responsibility for AP's
six-member regional reporting team and five-member national writing
team. She is a graduate of Penn State University.
   Silverman, 44, joined the AP in San Francisco in 1971 and
transferred to the General Desk five years later. In 1985 he was
named AP's senior national editor, responsible for coordinating
daily coverage of national news. Silverman is a graduate of the
University of Chicago and Stanford University.

   Palestinian refugees outside the
Israeli-occupied territories welcomed the PLO declaration of a new
state Tuesday, but some criticized the implied recognition of Israel.
   ``I'm as happy as if I had won millions of dinars,'' said
23-year-old Ahmed Salhi, whose family fled to the Al-Hussein refugee
camp in Amman from Lydda in what is now Israel.
   In Abu Dhabi, a Persian Gulf emirate, teacher Irtifaa Gameel
Khateeb said: ``It's lovely to hear the term Palestinian state .. .
but the Palestinian is still being beaten up'' in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   More than 300 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded
since an uprising against Israeli occupation began in the occupied
lands Dec. 8, 1987.
   One of more than 300,000 Palestinians who live in Kuwait,
economist Tewfik Abdel-Latif, called the declaration ``a good
political step that represents an embarrassment to Israel and the
United States. They should now prove their good intentions.''
   He referred to the U.S. refusal to deal with the Palestine
Liberation Organization until it endorsed U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, which implies acceptance of Israel, and renounced
terrorism.
   The Palestine National Council, meeting in Algiers, proclaimed a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and endorsed the
U.N. resolution while stressing Palestinian rights to
self-determination.
   It also said guerrilla actions against Israel would be limited to
military targets in the occupied territories, where the Palestinian
state presumably would be established. The council serves as the PLO
legislature.
   Some pessimism was evident.
   ``I think the Americans will not recognize the PLO regardless of
what concessions we extend,'' said businessman Mohammed Hassan in
Kuwait. ``They will now say what the PLO did is inadequate, we want
more.''
   A dentist at the Al-Hussein camp, Bassam Khadra, said: ``As a
political step it means the recognition of Israel and we reject
that.'' His family is from Safad in what is now Israel.
   In Damascus, Syria, Palestinian groups opposed to PLO chief
Yasser Arafat said the declaration was ``dangerous'' and threatened
the unity of Palestinians involved in the uprising.
   In the Jebel Hussein district of Amman, Saadi Dabbour, a
physician from a Safad family, served Palestinian sweets to visitors
at his clinic to celebrate the Algiers announcement.
   Dabbour said he was ``full of happiness. ... I have been waiting
for this for four decades.''
   Asked about recognizing Israel, he said: ``It is an evil that we
cannot avoid.''
   Abdul-Munim Subeihi, a butcher in the Al-Hussein camp, said his
family fled Lydda in 1948 and he will return someday.
   ``I was prosecuted (in Jordan) ... on charges of smuggling
weapons to the West Bank,'' he said. ``I will go back (to
Palestine). ... I am very happy. There is something now I can depend
on.''
   Shukri Ibrahim, a taxi driver who came to Amman's Nuzha camp from
Jaffa in 1968, said: ``All the people I drove today said they are
celebrating the new beginning, a bright one, the Palestinian state.
Long live Palestine.''
   About 26,000 refugees are crowded into Al-Hussein camp, on the
slope of a hill in the Jordanian capital. Scores of children played
in front of simple concrete houses along narrow dirt lanes that
intersect the main paved road through the camp. The main road was
lined with stalls for the weekly vegetable market and customers
crowded around them.
   More than 100,000 registered refugees live in five official camps
in the Amman area, and at least 100,000 more live in five camps in
northern Jordan. Jordan has about 800,000 registered Palestinian
refugees.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new to clarify nature of alleged braking probleand

<TEXT>
   vehicle by the drag of the engine, NHTSA said.
   Meantime, the agency said it has ended a five-year investigation
into alleged power-brake failure in GM's 1980 X-body cars, finding
that ``no defect trend'' existed.
   The allegations of a defect had been cited as contributing to a
brake problem linked to 1,417 accidents, 18 deaths and 400 injuries,
NHTSA said.
   A federal court after a lengthy trial refused to order a recall
of 1.1 million 1980 X-body cars.
   NHTSA opened its inquiry into the Sundance and Shadow vehicles, a
total of 345,000 cars, as an engineering analysis, the second
highest level of investigation.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said the company was
cooperating with the investigation. The manufacturer, in a service
bulletin on the problem earlier this year, described the problem as
a failure of the engine to return to a lower rate of idle if it were
driven while cold.
   ``In terms of ever feeling that you're out of control of the car
and you can't stop it _ No. ... It is just slightly higher than the
idle normally would be when the engine is warm,'' Stewart said.
   She said the company believes no braking problem is involved.
   NHTSA also began seven lower-level investigations into alleged
defects involving cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and two foreign manufacturers, Subaru and Saab.
   One involved three complaints of the wheel and hub assembly
falling off 1986-1987 Pontiac Fieros because of metal fatigue.
   The problem resulted in three accidents but no injuries,
according to unconfirmed reports received by NHTSA. The preliminary
evaluation involves 104,000 vehicles.
   GM, the maker of the cars, pledged to cooperate with the NHTSA
investigation, but spokesman John Anderson added, ``Just because
there is an investigation doesn't necessarily mean there is a
defect.''
   NHTSA also opened preliminary evaluations into allegations that:
   _The power-steering pump on 1987 GM Firebirds and Camaros
fractures, causing a loss of power steering. The investigation,
based on 10 complaints, involves 250,000 vehicles.
   _The bracket bolts holding the steering column on the 1988 Ford
F-150 light truck come off, causing the column to fall. The
investigation, based on two complaints, involves 80,000 vehicles.
   _The adjustable front-seat headrest on the 1986-1988 Ford Taurus
and Sable cannot be kept in a raised position. The investigation,
based on three complaints, involves about 1.2 million vehicles.
   _The front-seat bracket of the 1986-1987 Taurus and Sable fails,
allowing the seat to move nd making control of the cars difficult.
The investigation, based on four complaints, involves 420,000
vehicles.
   _A faulty oil-pressure gauge sensor on the 1984 Subaru GL fails
to work, allowing oil to leak in the engine compartment, where it
causes a fire. The investigation, based on three complaints,
involves 157,000 vehicles.
   _A faulty cable can cause the battery to short-circuit on the
1988 Saab 900 Turbo. The investigation in the 5,000 cars was
prompted by a Saab service bulletin.
   Besides the GM X-cars, NHTSA also closed without action
investigations into alleged:
   _Cruise-control response in GM's 1988 G-series vans with
6.2-liter diesel engines.
   _Driver-seat failure in Ford's 1988 Lincoln Mark VII.
   _Rear-wheel lockup in Ford's 1983-1984 F-250 trucks.
   _Windshield wiper failure on Chrysler's 1987 Jeep Wrangler.
   _Seat failure in Mitsubishi's 1986 Montero.

<HEAD>US Rejects Palestinian State But Finds Positive Elements in PLO
Stand</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with Helms comments</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Tuesday there
are ``positive elements'' in a new Palestine Liberation Organization
policy statement but it rejected a PLO proclamation of an
independent Palestinian state.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the status of
territories under Israeli occupation ``cannot be determined by
unilateral acts of either side but only through a process of
negotiations. A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood is
such a unilateral act.''
   The statement early Tuesday in Algiers by the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council, did not specify
the borders of the new territory but it presumably encompasses the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have been under Israeli control
since 1967.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration sees ``positive elements'' to the PNC statement,
including its acceptance of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242
and 338.
   These lay the groundwork for a comprehensive settlement to the
Arab-Israeli conflict and implicitly recognize Israel's right to
exist.
   Successive U.S. administrations have conditioned the opening of a
dialogue with the PLO on its acceptance of those resolutions.
   The administration's response left ambiguous whether it sees the
new policy statement as representing a significant shift in the PLO
stance and whether it could provide the basis for a changed U.S.
policy.
   President-elect George Bush told reporters that ``I think the
jury is still out. If indeed there is specific recognition of ...
Resolution 242, that would be a very important step forward. And I
have to wait until I'm sure that that is exactly what's taken place.
But it would be something that we've been encouraging for a long,
long time.''
   The PLO declaration left open the possibility that the incoming
administration may give high priority to the Middle East during its
early months in office. Bush himself said he already has talked with
Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III about it, and said,
``Obviously we're going to be concerned about the Middle East.''
   Redman said the administration has not seen the final text but
promised it would receive ``serious study.''
   ``Our objective is a comprehensive peace,'' Redman said. ``Direct
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process.
Palestinian participation is required at every stage of
negotiations. All participants in the negotiations must renounce
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted
international basis of U.N. Security Council resolutions 224 and
338.''
   The PLO declaration renounces terrorist activities against
civilian targets but the administration insists that the PLO must
forswear all terrorist activities, among other conditions.
   The administration was more ambivalent in its attitude toward the
outcome of the Algiers meeting than was Israel, whose Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir ruled out all negotiations with the PLO ``because
they are opposed to peace with Israel.''
   Fitzwater said it was not clear whether the PLO initiative
constituted an olive branch to Israel.
   Reagan added to the confusion about future steps with his
response to a question on whether the United States was ready to
talk with the PLO.
   ``That's under consideration. We do not know exactly what is in
the agreement,'' he said.
   That statement went far beyond what his official spokesmen were
willing to say but it was not clear whether Reagan understood the
question, which a reporter shouted at him at the conclusion of a
departure ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House for visiting
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Fitzwater quickly amended Reagan's remark by saying, ``What he
was referring to was the meeting of the Palestine National Council
and the fact that we would have to consider and we are considering
the results of those meetings, but that we have reached no decisions
on them.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., wrote a letter to President
Reagan urging him to withhold recognition of the PNC decisions and
to encourage U.S. allies to do the same.
   ``The declaration falls short of the statutory standard'' set by
Congress for contacts with the PLO, Helms said.
   He said U.S. policy since 1975, as well as a bill passed by
Congress several years ago, states that the PLO ``must expressly
recognize Israel.'' The PNC decision does not do so, Helms added.

   Negotiators reached tentative agreement Tuesday
on a plan that will bring Namibian independence from South Africa in
early 1989 and a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola over a 27-month
period, U.S. officials said.
   The agreement was worked out during five days of negotiations in
Geneva involving officials from South Africa, Cuba and Angola. It is
subject to final approval by their respective governments.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said current plans call
for the formal agreement to be signed in early December. The accord
was mediated by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker.
   The plan calls for implementation, starting in February, of a
U.N. Security Council resolution designed to end South Africa's
73-year rule over Namibia, Africa's last colony.
   Under the plan, elections for Namibia's first independent
government will be held in August and the new regime will take
office in early 1990, the officials said.
   A second part of the agreement envisions the withdrawal of
two-thirds of the more than 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola during the
one-year period ending in December 1989.
   The agreement also calls for the gradual redeployment of
remaining Cuban troops northward, away from the Namibian border and
from the stronghold of anti-communist Angolan rebels backed by the
United States.
   In Geneva, no details were disclosed but South Africa's chief
negotiator, Neil Van Heerden, said, ``All parties have agreed to
take a document home to their governments.''
   He said the document would be the basis for a final agreement
``if the parties accept it.''
   Cuba first sent troops to Angola in 1975 to help the fledgling
independent government, newly freed from Portuguese colonial rule,
fend off military incursions from South Africa which was concerned
about communist penetration of the region.
   With the exception of a residual force, all the Cubans will be
back home by early 1991 under the timetable agreed to in Geneva.
   Left unanswered is the fate of the U.S.-backed rebel movement,
known by its Portuguese initials, UNITA.
   South Africa has been the principal supplier of the UNITA forces
for years, ferrying equipment across the Namibian border to the
rebel stronghold in southeast Angola.
   But with South Africa apparently intending on removing its forces
from Namibia, that country will no longer be able to continue its
resupply operation because of logistical problems.
   President-elect George Bush has said U.S. support for UNITA will
continue, but American officials have indicated that the South
African resupply role cannot be duplicated.
   On the other hand, the officials said that Cuba has played an
indispensable role in supporting the Angolan Army and that the
removal of the Cuban troops will shift the military balance in
UNITA's favor.
   Crocker has sought to bring an end to Angola's internal conflict
by calling for national reconciliation negotiations between Angola's
Marxist government and the UNITA rebels.
   But the Angolan government has rejected negotiations with UNITA,
calling instead on the rebels to lay down their arms and join in a
national reconstruction effort.

   At least 13 nations recognized the
Palestinian state declared Tuesday, most of them Arab or Moslem
backers of the PLO, but Europe was cautious and Palestinians opposed
to Yasser Arafat condemned the move.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, welcomed the
decision by the Palestine National Council to recognize Israel's
right to exist and said it opens ``fresh opportunities .. . for
progress towards peace.''
   Countries recognizing the state included Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq,
Jordan, Kuwait, Tunisia, Saudia Arabia, North and South Yemen,
Malaysia, Mauritania, Turkey and Indonesia.
   Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco stopped short of
extending diplomatic recognition but said they supported the move by
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the
Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt read a statement to
reporters saying: ``The establishment of a Palestinian state is an
important step toward achievement of a peaceful settlement of the
Middle East crisis through agreement among all parties to the
conflict.''
   Only Egypt among Arab countries has signed a peace treaty with
Israel.
   Britain's Foreign Office called the declaration ``premature.''
Norway said it was a step forward in the Middle East peace process
but that a state without territory could not be recognized, and the
Netherlands described the declaration as ``no breakthrough.''
   In Spain, Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said the
``step of enormous importance ... will obligate the United States
and Europe to review their policy stand on the Middle East peace
process.''
   Sten Andersson, Sweden's foreign minister, said the decision
``could be a historic step that opens the way for peace and
reconciliation.''
   Greece said it ``salutes the courageous decision of the Palestine
National Council ... within the framework of United Nations
resolutions and international law.'' The Greek government has
diplomatic relations with both Israel and the PLO.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
``foundations of the state-to-be are unsound and unenduring.'' Iran
is Moslem but not Arab.
   Kuwait said it hopes ``this state will realize the hopes and
aspirations of the Palestinian people in building up their national
and pan-Arab identity on their national soil.''
   Syria, which backs Palestinian factions opposed to Arafat, made
no official statement. A commentator on the state radio said: ``The
road to liberation, just rights and peace is the road of struggle
and refusal of any surrender in front of the enemy.''
   A statement from the Fatah Uprising guerrilla group in Damascus
called the declaration a ``catastrophe'' and said of Arafat and his
supporters: ``Their most dangerous aspect is that they threaten the
unity of our people inside the occupied territories and deal a blow
to the unity of the land (Palestine).''
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
said: ``This is a black day in our history, as they are trying to
fool our people through declaring an illusion independence to cover
their renouncing most of the Palestinian territory.''
   Jordan's official news agency quoted Prime Minister Zaid Rifai as
saying his country ``has always recognized the Palestine Liberation
Organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people and the PNC represents their will.''
   He said the kingdom will ``continue to support the PLO in its
efforts to insure the national rights of the Palestinian people,
including their right to self-determination and the creation of
their independent state on their national soil.''

   President Reagan set limited goals Tuesday for
his farewell meeting next month with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. U.S. officials said the administration has proposed the
session be held over lunch on Dec. 7 at New York's Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
   Reagan said the meeting, in which President-elect George Bush
will participate, will not be in the nature of a summit. But mindful
of Gorbachev's escalation of the agenda at their meeting in Iceland
two years ago, he said, ``We'll just have to see what comes up.''
   At the session, Reagan plans to seek Soviet confirmation that the
four-part agenda for superpower relations, which included arms
control and human rights, would be carried over to the Bush
administration, said U.S. officials.
   The two other agenda items for the four Reagan-Gorbachev summit
meetings as well as the talks Secretary of State George P. Shultz
held with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze were
regional conflicts, such as the war in Afghanistan, and U.S.-Soviet
bilateral problems.
   Reagan is likely to seek a reaffirmation from Gorbachev of a
Soviet pledge to withdraw all Soviet troops from Afghanistan by Feb.
15, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The plans for the meeting at the Manhattan art museum have not
yet been approved by Moscow, the officials said.
   They stressed they did not expect Reagan and Gorbachev to
complete a new treaty scaling back U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear
weapons. That will be left for the Bush administration to pursue,
the officials said.
   The meeting is to be held in conjunction with a speech by
Gorbachev to the U.N. General Assembly. Bush, who takes office Jan.
20, is already committed to pursuing a summit with Gorbachev next
year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the agenda had not
been set. Shultz plans to fly immediately after the Gorbachev
session to a meeting with the foreign ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels Dec. 8-9.
   Gorbachev proposed the meeting with Reagan and Bush through
Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin. The envoy delivered a note to
Shultz on Sunday from Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a
U.S. official said.
   The president told reporters he anticipated ``a brief
get-together'' with the Soviet leader. They have held four summits
in the last three years and improved superpower relations. The
principal achievement was the treaty Reagan and Gorbachev signed
last December in Washington to abolish U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Reagan, asked about seeing Gorbachev again, said ``that's not
going to be anything in the nature of a summit meeting.'' He
acknowledged, however, that he had ``no way of speculating'' what
proposals the Soviet leader might offer.
   Other U.S. officials said the agenda would be worked out in
diplomatic exchanges between Washington and Moscow. ``Likewise, the
nature of the meeting,'' said State Department spokesman Charles E.
Redman.
   Before Reagan and Gorbachev met in Reykjavik, the capital of
Iceland, in October 1986, U.S. officials had limited expectations of
their agenda. But the two leaders proceeded to reach tentative
judgments about wide-ranging reductions in their nuclear arsenals.
The summit broke up in a disagreement over Reagan's anti-missile
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Asked if the New York meeting could develop the same way, Reagan
replied: ``That depends on whether you are going by the public
version of Reykjavik or what actually happened there.''
   He did not elaborate and reporters quizzing Reagan while he posed
for pictures with visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl went
on to other questions.
   Bush has already said he did not need a get-acquainted meeting
with Gorbachev, having met him during the Soviet leader's visit to
Washington. The president-elect has said he would like to hold a
summit meeting provided it held out promise of progress in any one
of several areas, including arms control and human rights.
   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, his
choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with NATO foreign ministers.
   ``What I want to see is progress,'' Bush said last Wednesday.
``I've never supported meetings just for the sake of having
meetings.''
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
described the meeting as part of ``a continuation of the U.S.-Soviet
political dialogue that we believe should continue without
artificial pause.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said the main purpose from the U.S.
standpoint was to ``ensure that the momentum and continuity of the
arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the
relationship between the general secretary and the new president of
the United States.''
   ``I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling
things,'' he said.
   Several major issues in the U.S.-Soviet relationship are on the
brink of resolution.
   These include a treaty that would reduce by 30 to 50 percent U.S.
and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines, and
arrangements for the withdrawal of more than 50,000 Cuban troops
from Angola.
   Also, the Soviets two weeks ago announced a suspension of their
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, while the two sides are
maneuvering for position on a Soviet drive to hold a conference in
Moscow on human rights.
   Announcing Gorbachev's visit, the Soviet news agency Tass said he
would travel also to Britain and Cuba and set forth Soviet views on
problems of world development in his speech to the United Nations.
   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in
November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Reykjavik,
then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   At the end of the Moscow summit, Reagan said the two leaders had
established so deep a relationship they could get together and
discuss world problems ``without the necessity of a planned
agreement,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the New York meeting, their last, ``will reflect that
relationship.''
   Moreover, the spokesman said, ``this brief meeting will help
smooth the transition from president to president-elect. It will
ensure that the moment and continuity of the arms control talks are
extended. It will reaffirm the relations between the general
secretary and the new president of the united states as we enter the
decade of the '90s.''

   Federal investigators on Tuesday called for an
immediate review of air traffic control procedures in the Northeast
after finding that a string of errors allowed a commuter plane to
fly alarmingly close to Air Force One last month.
   The incident, which had been reported previously without detail,
occurred Oct. 12 when Air Force One with President Reagan aboard and
a Bar Harbor Airlines commuter plane flew within 500 feet vertically
and 1.5 miles horizontally as both planes were preparing to descend
to Newark, N.J.
   Standard separation for aircraft is 1,000 feet vertically and
five miles horizontally. At the time of the incident, White House
officials said the president was never in danger.
   But the incident prompted a broad investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board which said Tuesday that ``numerous
managerial, operational and training deficiencies'' at four Federal
Aviation Administration facilities near Washington, at Philadelphia
and near New York were at fault.
   These errors reflected ``a serious lack of effective management
and quality assurance,'' said the NTSB. It called on the FAA to
conduct an independent investigation of air traffic control
performance at the facilities involved similar to a probe recently
concluded after a series of controller errors at Chicago.
   The board also said it was particularly concerned about its
findings because the FAA on a number of occasions dating back to
l986 had investigated similar shortcomings at the facilities and
indicated improvements had been made.
   ``The seriousness and magnitude of the problems ... justifies the
highest level of FAA attention and action,'' the five board members
said in a letter to FAA Administrator Allan McArtor.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency would have no immediate
comment on the NTSB findings.
   Among the findings that raised the NTSB's concerns were:
   _The controller at the Washington air traffic control center near
Leesburg, Va., who was handling the Bar Harbor plane, was never
aware that Air Force One was in the same vicinity as the commuter in
airspace between Philadelphia and Newark.
   _A senior controller who was handling Air Force One was not clear
on airspace boundaries and allowed Air Force One to penetrate the
Washington center airspace handled by the controllers near Leesburg.
   _A directive to hold up traffic into Newark because of the
impending arrival of Air Force One was misunderstood because the
message was not specific regarding which route Air Force One was
using.
   _Two controllers who observed Air Force One and the commuter
plane converging did not raise an alarm because they assumed there
were plans already made to resolve the potential conflict.
   _An area supervisor involved indirectly in the incident was found
to have been ``assigned to a position for which he was untrained and
uncertified'' while another air traffic coordinator was given duties
``without receiving formal on-the-job training or a briefing on his
responsibilities.''
   The board said these and other shortcomings ``contributed
directly or indirectly to this incident.''
   As a result, the NTSB said, a controller at the Washington air
route center gave the Bar Harbor commuter pilot permission to
descend from 11,000 feet to 7,000 feet, while another controller at
the New York air traffic control center cleared Air Force One to
descend from 11,000 feet to 9,000 feet.
   Both planes were converging toward roughly the same area.
   The two planes were allowed to continue to converge until another
controller noticed the two aircraft and directed the commuter to
halt his descent at 10,000 feet and directed it away from the Reagan
aircraft, the safety board said.
   At one point, two other air traffic controllers, whose primary
responsibility was to monitor traffic flow, ``realized there was a
potential conflict when the radar targets, representing Air Force
One and the commuter plane were about 10 miles apart and at about
the same altitude,'' the investigators said.
   But the two controllers, who were not directly handling either of
the planes, ``did not initiate a (warning) ... because they believed
that some type of separation standard was going to be achieved.''
   When the incident occurred, Reagan was on a campaign trip on
behalf of Vice President George Bush. He had spoken near
Philadelphia and was headed for Newark for another appearance.
During the trip, officials advised reporters of the incident but
provided no details and emphasized that Air Force One was never in
danger of a collision.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president was not
aware of the incident until later. FAA officials said that the pilot
of Air Force One had been advised that the Bar Harbor commuter plane
was nearby and no evasive action was required.
   Bar Harbor aircraft was flying as Continental Express Flight 3494
and carried 33 passengers and three crew members on a flight from
Baltimore to Newark.

<TEXT>
   The right-wing Likud bloc asked the Labor Party
Tuesday to join a coalition government as junior partner, but both
sides indicated there were too many policy differences.
   Likud and Labor, which leans to the left, spent four years as
equal partners in a tenuous ``national unity'' coalition after
indecisive elections in July 1984.
   In parliamentary elections Nov. 1, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset and Labor, led
by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, got 39.
   Shamir has been negotiating with small right-wing and religious
parties. On Monday, President Chaim Herzog asked him to form a
government.
   During a 90-minute meeting Tuesday, Shamir said Labor could join
a government under his leadership only if it dropped its insistence
on an international Middle East peace conference.
   Peres did not respond publicly to the demands, but Israel radio
said Labor ministers in the caretaker Cabinet opposed a coalition
under such conditions.
   After two weeks of negotiations, Shamir is in a position to form
a majority coalition with four religious parties and three from the
extreme right. His offer to Labor was seen as an attempt to avoid
growing demands from those potential partners.
   ``I explained to Labor that the good of the country demands the
establishment of a broad-based government, a government which would
include the Likud, Labor and those parties that expressed a
willingness to join a government under my leadership,'' the prime
minister said on Israel television.
   ``We have heard an invitation,'' Peres said. ``Some things were
more explicit, some things were more open-ended. We will discuss it
and then decide.''
   The 4-year-old coalition, in the first half of which Peres was
prime minister and Shamir foreign minister, has been split on how to
achieve peace with Arab nations and end the 11-month-long
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir and Likud refuse to trade occupied land for peace, have
called for increased military measures to end the Palestiinian
revolt and oppose an international conference, which the Arabs
demand.
   Peres and his Labor Party are willing to exchange some of the
occupied land for peace and favor an international conference.
   Yitzhak Modai of Likud said: ``The question is do we have a
common approach on basic issues. After glancing at Labor's election
platform, I would have to say no.''

<HEAD>Brazilians Vote in Local Elections Seen As Test For Sarney</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Brazilians voted Tuesday in
municipal elections seen as popularity test for President Jose
Sarney's government. Exit polls showed the government trailing
badly, a television network said.
   At stake were mayoralties and city legislatures in 4,307 cities
and towns in Latin America's biggest country.
   Sarney has been widely blamed for the country's economic
stagnation, inflation approaching 2,000 percent a year and a 40
percent drop in workers' buying power.
   Exit polls showed the government party leading in just six of
Brazil's 24 state capitals, according to TV Globo, the nation's
largest private network. In 1985 mayoral and city council elections,
the same party took 17 major cities.
   Pre-election polls showed Sarney's Brazilian Democratic Movement
Party _ which in 1986 swept elections for state governors, state
assemblies and Congress _ will be fortunate if it wins even three
mayorships in Brazil's 14 largest cities.
   More than 75 million registered voters were to choose from 1.2
million candidates belonging to 29 parties, ranging from two
communist groups to supporters of the former military regime.
   Lines at polling places were four city blocks long in many cities.
   Some results were expected late Tuesday, but officials said final
results probably would not be announced until Sunday.
   Voting is mandatory, and Brazilians who don't vote face trouble
getting a passport, obtaining a government loan or a civil service
job.
   Sarney, the first civilian president since a 21-year military
regime ended in 1985, called the elections a ``step toward
democracy.''
   ``Don't think democracy is easy .... To be a democrat, it's
necessary to renounce violence and convince by ideas and choose by
the ballot,'' the president told a nationwide television audience
Monday night.
   But recent polls showed voter apathy and distrust of politicians
were high. In Rio de Janeiro, many Brazilians took advantage of the
national holiday and the warm weather to crowd the city's famous
beaches, leaving voting for later.
   In recent weeks, a campaign begun by a satirical newspaper to
``elect'' a chimpanzee in the Rio Zoo as mayor has gained national
attention as a sign of Brazilians' lack of confidence in politicians
in general.
   Public service announcements on radio and television urged
Brazilians not to throw away their votes by casting blank ballots or
voting for nonsense candidates.
   Federal troops were stationed in 15 states and 271 municipalities
to keep order.
   Police arrested some campaign workers for violating a law
prohibiting last-minute campaigning within 300 feet of polling
stations. The workers were trying to hand out sample ballots with
their candidate's name written in.
   Sarney voted in his northern home state of Maranhao, then
returned to the capital of Brasilia.
   Sarney, a 58-year-old politician and poet, gained office as the
running mate of Tancredo Neves, who was chosen in a
military-controlled electoral college vote. Neves died shortly
before taking office.
   The elections are viewed as an important indicator of party
popularity as Brazil prepares for presidential elections in late
1989, the first such election in 29 years.

   A car smashed into a K mart department
store Tuesday, killing one person and injuring 13, authorities said.
   A witness said that after the car had plowed through the store
the driver tried to turn it around and drive back out.
   The car crashed through the front of the building and traveled
about 100 feet into the crowded store, spraying glass and concrete
and scattering employees and shoppers, said police Lt. Joseph
Simonetti.
   ``I just saw everybody flying,'' said Helen Romano, who was
standing outside the store when the accident occurred.
   At least 12 people were struck before the automobile came to a
stop.
   Ms. Romano said the driver of the late model Cadillac El Dorado
tried to drive out.
   The driver, 72-year-old Louis Prosperi of Bloomfield, was
questioned by police Tuesday evening and released.
   ``He stated he had a malfunction in the car,'' said Simonetti.
``The vehicle was impounded and will be given a safety and
mechanical check tomorrow. No charges have been filed or are pending
at this time.''
   The dead woman was identified as Barbara Urbanovick, 37, of
Nutley. Simonetti said she was pronounced dead at the scene.
   Clothing, cameras and jewelry were strewn across the store,
aisles were demolished and thick black skid marks were left on the
linoleum floor.
   One woman, Dorothy Becker, 65, was taken to University Hospital
in Newark where a spokeswoman said she was in guarded condition.
   Eleven others were taken to Clara Maass Medical Center in
Belleville, said hospital spokesman Lew Gardner. All were in stable
condition, with three of them suffering from leg and hip fractures
and the rest from lacerations and bruises, Gardner said.
   Hal Lindsay, district manager of the store chain, said there was
no available estimate of how much damage was done. He said police
would remain at the store to guard against looting.

   George Bush announced Tuesday that he was
asking Nicholas Brady to remain as Treasury secretary, and a source
said the president-elect also asked New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu
to be his White House chief of staff.
   Sununu, who is retiring as governor, had been one of two top
candidates for the job, along with Craig Fuller, who was chief of
staff for nearly four years in Bush's vice presidential office.
   Bush made the announcement to keep Brady after meeting with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the first of a string of sessions the
president-elect has scheduled with foreign leaders. Bush will meet
Wednesday with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and will
confer with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month.
   Bush also said Tuesday that his administration would work to
reduce the budget deficit while resisting higher taxes and trade
protectionism.
   His decision to keep Brady, 58, in the Cabinet was expected.
   ``Our most important priority is to keep our economy growing with
low inflation and he knows that we must resist the policies that
will impede that effort, such as raising taxes or resorting to
protection,'' Bush said.
   He said Brady ``knows we've got to sit down with the Congress on
a deficit-reduction agreement and we've got to do it soon.''
   Brady, a former investment banker and Bush's longtime friend, is
the second person chosen for the new Cabinet. Bush last week picked
James A. Baker III, his election campaign chairman, as secretary of
state.
   An official announcement of Sununu's appointment was expected
later.
   A source said Bush had decided on Sununu, whom he had invited to
a private dinner Monday night at a vacation retreat in Florida and
who flew back to Washington with Bush on Tuesday.
   Sununu declined to talk about his future as he arrived back at
the nation's capital.
   ``I'm still governor,'' said the 49-year-old conservative
Republican, who was credited with helping Bush save a primary
victory after the vice president lost Iowa's GOP caucuses. ``I'll do
whatever he needs.''
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate, after talking with Fuller and
transition co-director Robert Teeter, said late Tuesday that she
could not confirm the choice.
   Also mentioned as possible candidates for the post were Fuller,
37, co-director of Bush's transition office, and Teeter, the other
co-director.
   Republican sources involved in Bush's campaign and on the outside
said Tuesday night that Fuller would not want a White House post
under Sununu. There has been widespread speculation that he might
accept another post such as a Cabinet job.
   Sununu was promoted for the chief of staff job by conservatives
who felt that he had more of an ideological edge than Fuller.
   ``I will make orderly announcements,'' Bush said. ``We're really
just beginning to take a look at the Cabinet.''
   Bush said he informed Kohl of his choice of Brady and that the
West German Chancellor was pleased. The U.S. dollar has fallen
sharply in relation to foreign currencies, including the West German
mark.
   ``I'll do my best to help the president-elect, serve the people
and to build on this, the longest recovery in the history of the
country,'' said Brady, a former senator from New Jersey who
succeeded Baker at Treasury last August.
   He had no comment on the fall of the dollar.
   Bush said the announcement was not made particularly to calm
world financial markets. But he added, ``I hope to the degree they
need calming they will have that effect.''
   He described Brady, a former co-chairman of the investment
banking house of Dillon, Read & Co., as a man who ``brings to his
office an extraordinary knowledge of financial markets, experience
in the private sector.''
   Bush cited Brady's involvement in the presidential panel that
studied the Oct. 19, 1987 stock market crash, as well as the
Kissinger commission on Central America and the Packard commission
on Pentagon management.
   Bush said he and Brady will sit down soon to focus on the savings
and loan industry crisis, in which about 900 thrift institutions are
either insolvent or ailing. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board says it
may cost the government up to $50 billion to bail them out.
   The Bush-Kohl meeting took place at the vice president's official
residence several miles from the White House. Vice President-elect
Dan Quayle and West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher
sat in on the talks.
   Bush has said he wants to forge close ties with the Western
allies, and the discussions with Kohl and Mrs. Thatcher raise the
possibility of an early meeting with leaders of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   The president-elect has vowed to hold an early summit with
Gorbachev but said he wants to see Soviet progress on issues such as
arms control, human rights and regional conflicts. Reagan has held
four summits with Gorbachev, and he and Bush plan to see him in New
York next month, when the Kremlin leader addresses the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Meantime, the rumor mill worked overtime on who might be
appointed to top jobs in the next administration.
   The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, planned to
deliver 2,500 resumes to the transition office, hoping to place
people with their views in jobs. Chase Untermeyer, the transition's
personnel director, is guiding the selection process for at least
5,000 political jobs.
   Among those expected to round out Bush's economic team are
Richard Darman as budget director and Michael Boskin as head of the
Council of Economic Advisers.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who has been mentioned for a
possible Cabinet post, spent the day here Tuesday, delivering a
speech to a conservation group. His name has cropped up for possible
secretary of transportation.
   Sources on Capitol Hill said Bush campaign official Janet Mullins
was a leading candidate to serve as chief congressional lobbyist.
   Loret Ruppe, the Peace Corps director, has been touted as a
possible secretary of health and human services, as has Rep. Willis
Gradison, R-Ohio. At the Commerce Department, Robert Mosbacher's
name has surfaced. He is a Houston oilman who was the Bush
campaign's finance director.
   Meanwhile, Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., said Tuesday
he had heard that his name ``is at the top of the list'' among
Bush's possible choices for secretary of veterans affairs. However,
he said Bush had not mentioned the new Cabinet level post to him.
   Montgomery, as chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee,
last year helped push to passage legislation that elevated the
Veterans Administration to a Cabinet-level agency. He and Bush have
been friends since both were freshman congressmen 22 years ago.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs on Costa Rica proposal for U.N. observers.</NOTE>

   The General Assembly on Tuesday adopted a
consensus resolution opposing outside interference in the Central
American peace process. The United States blamed Nicaragua for
obstructing democracy in the region.
   ``The United States urges the international community to adopt a
realistic and honest appraisal of the disastrous effects of
Nicaraguan mismanagement and repression upon the search for peace
and democracy in Central America,'' said U.S. Ambassador Patricia M.
Byrne, U.S. alternate representative to the world body.
   As it did last year, the assembly endorsed by consensus a
resolution supporting the peace plan of five Central American
countries signed in Guatemala City on Aug. 7, 1987. The five who
signed the plan, also known as Esquipulas II, are Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
   But in a change from last year, the resolution said the General
Assembly ``appeals to the countries which are outside the region but
which have links with it and interests in it to facilitate the
implementation of the Esquipulas II accords and to abstain from any
action which may impede such implementation.''
   The reference appeared aimed at the United States, which aides
the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, as well as Cuba and the
Soviet Union, both of which arm Salvadoran rebels. The peace plan
prohibits foreign aid to rebels.
   Byrne told the assembly that the United States shares the desire
of the Central American peoples for democracy. But she said some
``troubling developments'' and anti-democratic trends in Nicaragua
were not addressed in the resolution.
   One year ago, Byrne said, the peace plan represented a mechanism
for moving toward democracy.
   ``Now, we know that the promise is not yet fully realized and
that one Central American country (Nicaragua) has not lived up to
its commitments,'' she said.
   Byrne said that under the peace plan Nicaragua promised a free
press, freedom of assembly and free elections. ``It has delivered on
none of these promises,'' she said. Nicaraguan elections have been
postponed, the free press is in danger of extinction and political
opposition leaders are in jail, the U.S. envoy said.
   She protested that the resolution calls for international
economic cooperation ``despite the absence of any progress by
Nicaragua to grant the freedoms that are basic to building a healthy
economy.''
   But Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera told the
Assembly that U.S. aid to the Contras was impeding democracy in the
region and fulfillment of the peace plan.
   He said the U.S. Reagan administration was using ``pressure and
manipulation of opposition groups ... in an effort to create
internal chaos.'' This, he said, had been orchestrated by the former
U.S. ambassador to Managua.
   He criticized the Reagan administration which last week renewed
its economic embargo against Nicaragua. This embargo was declared
illegal by the International Court of Justice in June 1986, he said,
and the General Assembly has demanded its revocation since 1985.
   Meanwhile, Costa Rica on Tuesday proposed that neutral observers
be stationed along Nicaragua's and El Salvador's borders with
Honduras.
   Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto made the suggestion
during his address to the General Assembly of the Organization of
American States meeting in San Salvador, El Salvador.
   He said stationing U.N. observers would be ``a procedure of
verification and control.''
   The presence of thousands of Contras in camps in Honduran
territory is one of the key obstacles to progress in the peace plan.

<HEAD>State Board Delays Action on AMA Request to Ban `Smokeless
Cigarette'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Board of Pharmacy on Tuesday
decided it wouldn't act on the American Medical Association's
request that it stop distribution of a new ``smokeless cigarette.''
   The R.J. Reynolds Co. is test marketing Premier cigarettes in
Phoenix, Tucson and St. Louis. The AMA filed a petition Nov. 2
seeking to have the product declared a new and hazardous drug, the
distribution of which then would fall under the auspices of the
pharmaceutical board.
   ``Our obligation is to protect the public health, so we feel that
something needs to be done about this,'' said Norma E. McConnell,
president of the board. But the board ``will not in the morning make
a decision that `yes it is a drug' or `no it isn't,' but we are
working toward that,'' she said.
   Mrs. McConnell said the board hopes to get more information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration, which regulates
distribution and marketing of drugs in the United States and has
more facilities and expertise that the state board.
   A petition the AMA filed with the FDA in April is pending.
   If the Arizona board later decides the cigarette is a drug, its
options include seeking an injunction, such as the AMA suggested in
its petition.
   ``Also, they have the authority as (the) AMA set forth in their
position to seize misbranded drugs,'' said Timothy J. Agan, an
assistant attorney general.
   Arizona law empowers the board to regulate drugs or hazardous
substances sold in Arizona, but it would have to file a lawsuit to
enforce any regulation declaring a product a drug, Agan said.
   Reynolds said in a news release that ``Premier is a cigarette ...
not a drug-delivery system, as the AMA has alleged.'' Its smoke,
Reynolds said, ``substantially reduces many of the chemical
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about.''
   The company also said at the time it found ``it difficult to
understand how the AMA can in good faith suggest that Premier be
banned.''
   Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, an AMA assistant executive vice president,
said the product contains nicotine, an ``addictive drug ... which
has been implicated in cardiovascular disease.''

<HEAD>Damage From Hurricane Joan: $828 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Tuesday said
Hurricane Joan caused more than $828 million in damages to
Nicaragua, more than the amount of money spent fighting the
U.S.-backed rebels.
   Ortega also suspended the 30-day state of emergency enacted two
days before Joan struck on Oct. 22. He called on workers, producers
and political opposition groups to help reconstruction.
   Thousands of homes were destroyed, bridges collapsed and
thousands of acres of crops were flooded. Ortega said 137 people
died in the hurricane and 119 people still were missing.
   He said almost 500,000 people were homeless.
   Ortega said the direct costs of the hurricane were more than $828
million. That figure did not include ecological damages, which he
said still were incalculable. The leftist Sandinista government said
in 1987 that direct costs of the civil war, which began in 1981, was
$586.5 million.
   Ortega puts total war costs at more than $12 billion, including
loans to Nicaragua blocked by the United States and projections of
what Nicaraguan exports could have earned if not for the fighting.
   The president, in an 90-minute speech before the National
Assembly and foreign diplomats, called on Nicaraguan workers and
producers to create a fund to aid rural peasants who suffered the
worst damages in the hurricane.
   ``These peasants lost their homes, their work implements, their
harvests,'' Ortega said. ``These peasants don't have anything.''
   Ortega lashed out at the United States for failing to offer
emergency assistance but continuing to fund the rebels known as
Contras.
   ``The only humanitarian aid the Yankee government, the Yankee
Congress has approved is already known to us, that which they have
approved for criminals, Somoza guards, to continue killing the
people,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration began funding the Contras almost two
years after the Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary
war that desposed the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza. Washington
claims Nicaragua is a communist beachhead in Central America.
   The Nicaraguan economy has suffered from the war, corruption and
government mismanagement. Ortega pointed out that when the
Sandinistas assumed power, Nicaragua's economy already was reeling
from the revolution and a powerful earthquake in 1972 that
devastated Managua, the capital, and killed 10,000 people.
   Sandinista measures to right the economy failed. Inflation runs
rampant, with some analysts putting it as high as 10,000 percent
annually. The average worker complains he lacks the income to buy
basic food staples.
   Nicaragua ran a trade deficit last year of $520 million. The
foreign debt is estimated at $6 billion.
   Ortega said the government would enact new economic policies, but
provided no details.
   Ortega said the threat posed by Hurricane Joan no longer existed
in explaining his decision to repeal the state of emergency, which
curbed some constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and
empowered the government to take over private property if necessary.
   ``It was enacted to confront the phenomenon that was coming, to
be able to make preparations under the best conditions within the
mark of the law,'' Ortega said. ``This reason has disappeared.''

   More than 9,000 union members at
Walt Disney World voted Tuesday to accept a three-year contract,
averting a strike at the giant theme park.
   The six-union Service Trade Council had rejected similar offers
twice.
   Council president Harvey Totzke said the vote was 1,059 to 677 in
favor of the agreement.
   ``I think they finally took a realistic look at the offer. I can
say it now, it was a fair offer. We got all we could get.''
   ``I'm obviously very happy about it,'' said Bill Ward, Disney
vice president for labor relations. ``We felt that we had a good
contract.''
   The new contract calls for raises of 50 cents an hour to workers
now at top scale. They earn $6.80 an hour in the lowest pay grade to
$9.70 an hour at the top grade. Workers below top scale would
receive raises of 35 cents an hour. In April 1990, workers at top
scale would get pay increases of 45 cents an hour, while those below
top scale would receive 30 cents an hour more.
   The Service Trades Council represents workers in various
categories, including ride operators, animal handlers, monorail
pilots and the people who portray Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy
and other characters.

   The PLO's parliament-in-exile proclaimed
an independent Palestinian state early today, approving a new,
moderate political program that indirectly recognizes Israel and
renounces terrorism.
   Addressing the body, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat declared that the
state, with Jerusalem as its capital, would be run by ``a
democratic, parliamentary system based on freedom of expression and
multiple parties.''
   Passage of the proclamation could mark a turning point in the
four-decade struggle through repeated Arab-Israeli wars and
recurrent guerrilla attacks. Israel gained independence in 1948,
when British rule ended.

   The Soviet space shuttle Buran orbited the Earth
twice today and landed eight miles from its launch pad in Soviet
Central Asia, ending with flawless precision its unmanned 3-hour,
25-minute maiden flight.
   The mission was a major success for the Soviet space program
after a series of problems that included the near loss of cosmonauts
on a joint Soviet-Afghan mission to the Mir space station in
September.
   The Buran, snowstorm in Russian, touched down on a 2.8-mile
concrete runway with a puff of dust from its rear wheels and rolled
to a halt as three parachutes opened at its rear.
   ``The U.S.S.R. has successfully tested its first reusable space
craft Buran,'' official Radio Moscow said, interrupting regular
programming two minutes after touchdown.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make
another visit to the United States in early December and hold a
fifth and final meeting with President Reagan and, possibly,
President-elect George Bush, U.S. officials said.
   The Soviet leader also will address the United Nations General
Assembly as it winds up its current session.
   The meeting with Reagan around Dec. 7 would give the two sides
another chance to narrow the gap on a treaty to reduce long-range
nuclear weapons arsenals and to ease tensions caused by Afghan rebel
attacks on Soviet troops in Afghanistan and a slowdown in the Red
Army's withdrawal from the country.
   The treaty is bogged down with several technical problems that
may not be easily solved. But on Afghanistan, the Soviets already
have pledged to have all their forces out by Feb. 15.

   The incoming chairman of the House Budget
Committee says tax increases will be needed next year to make
legally required cuts in the federal deficit, despite
President-elect George Bush's anti-tax stance.
   ``Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size of the
challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said in an interview. ``Once you say this area won't be
considered, you paint yourself into a corner.''
   Panetta said new revenues will have to be part of any package for
the required reduction of red ink by tens of billions of dollars,
irregardless of Bush's oft-repeated campaign pledge ``no new taxes.''
   Under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, the deficit for the
1990 fiscal year _ which begins Oct. 1 _ is not to exceed $100
billion.

   Pakistan appears to have finally developed
atomic weapons, increasing the threat of a nuclear war with India
and representing a major setback to efforts to stem the spread of
atomic weapons around the globe, says a study published today.
   ``After a decade of slow advances, Pakistan appears to have''
joined a group of three other nations that have nuclear weapons but
don't admit it, according to the review by the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.
   The other countries in that category are Israel, India and South
Africa, said the report, the fourth such survey published by the
non-profit group that specializes in national security studies.
   Five nations have said they possess nuclear weapons: the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Great Britain and France. A sixth,
India, exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a
non-military explosion.

   Millions of transportation workers including
pilots and truckers will be subject to random drug tests under a new
federal directive that is likely to be challenged in court before it
goes into effect in December 1989.
   The Transportation Department announced the broad-ranging drug
testing requirements Monday, and immediately the head of the airline
pilots' union promised to fight the regulation both in Congress and
in the courts.
   The testing requirements cover all types of transportation,
including airlines, long-distance trucks and urban transit systems.
   ``The American people demand and expect a drug-free
transportation system. These new rules will take us as far as
practically possible toward that goal,'' Transportation Secretary
Jim Burnley said at a news conference.

   Women in poor physical shape are three times
more likely to die at an early age of heart disease than are those
who keep themselves in good condition, according to a long-term
study.
   Dr. Lars G. Ekelund, the principal author of the study, said it
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from
heart disease, just as it does men.
   Poor physical fitness ``is almost as important as smoking as a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease'' in women, said Ekelund, a
researcher at the University of North Carolina.
   The study was based on a 10{-year follow-up of 2,802 women who
ranged in age from 30 to 69. The results were presented Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Heart Association.

   Jake Steinfeld, the high-energy exercise
instructor and motivator has muscled into the ``infotainment'' TV
market, but is playing what he calls that game's ``right field''
this season.
   You have to get up at 5:30 a.m. in most areas of the country to
catch the 30-year-old Steinfeld's ``Body By Jake,'' his entry in the
crowded ``infotainment'' market. Steinfeld and show co-owner Samuel
Goldwyn Co. are hoping the show's format will put it ahead of other
shows for advancement to better time slots.
   ``It's like saying, `Put on a uniform. You're on the team, and
you can play right field for now.' So I'm in the game now. A lot of
balls aren't going to come to me, but I'm out here in right field.''
   Steinfeld, a popular figure through his ``Fitness Breaks'' on
Cable News Network, three exercise videos, a book and coaching of
such Hollywood luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford,
Michael J. Fox and Madonna, said in a recent interview that he has
been approached several times to do a television show.
   ``They've offered me to do exercise shows all over the place,''
Steinfeld said. ``The reason I refused was because I asked myself,
`Where is a show like that going to go? What are you going to say?
Tune in tomorrow and I'll count to 60?'''
   The answer is a show that mixes exercise, tips, pep talks and
unscripted chats with celebrity guests who talk about health or
personal care. The syndicated show currently is in 115 markets, or
about 86 percent of the country.
   ``The main thing is I don't take myself seriously in the show,''
Steinfeld said. ``I don't walk around saying `well, this is how
things are going to be done.' In the past, exercise people have done
that and there's a stereotype of that, with them jumping up and down
and screaming at people.
   ``The idea of the show is lifestyle. It's family. You don't want
to make health training and nutrition a second job,'' said
Steinfeld, who peppers his language with invented words such as
``buttissmo'' for buttocks and ``abadab'' for abdominal muscles.
   The show has a seven-minute ``energizer'' exercise segment along
with the tips and talk. But there's a twist.
   Instead of featuring a few good-looking models working out with
Jake, the show has a shapely ``advanced'' workout model and a guest
exerciser who is decidedly unfit. And that is the person Steinfeld
and the camera give the most attention to.
   ``When you watch these shows, everyone looks gorgeous,''
Steinfeld said. ``Here we are in L.A. We're very jaded here. Very
jaded. It's a very vain community. Everybody seems gorgeous here,
whether by naturalness or doctorness.
   ``But if you see a regular person working with Jake, you'll say,
`Hey, I can do that,'' he said.
   Brooklyn-born Steinfeld, whose often-repeated favorite slogan is
``Don't quit,'' has described himself as a chubby teen-ager until
his parents bought him a weightlifting set when he was 15. He spent
only one year in college in New York before deciding to move to
California and become a bodybuilder.
   ``I was living the life of a musclehead, eating, sleeping and
drinking bodybuilding ... sitting in the sun and bouncing at bars at
night,'' Steinfeld recalled.
   ``I entered a Mr. Southern California contest and came in second
without using steroids. The guy who beat me was on the stuff and
worked half as hard as I did and ate chocolate cake before the
contest because he was taking thyroid and all this other stuff,''
Steinfeld said.
   He was disillusioned with bodybuilding after that. ``I'm not even
close to that world anymore. I was mad. Here I was, a kid growing up
and reading muscle magazines, and no one ever said anything about
steroids. It made you think anyone could do it,'' he said.
   ``I just turned 30. When I was 20, nobody was talking about
steroids. And now its finally out there as an issue.''
   ``The best advice is do it naturally. You'll keep the weight you
want, you'll keep your strength forever, and you'll feel a lot
better about yourself,'' Steinfeld said.

<HEAD>Freed Hostage Says Faith Essential During Ordeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

   Recently freed from nearly two years as a hostage
of Islamic fundamentalists in Beirut, a university professor says
some kind of religious conviction is necessary to make it through
such an ordeal.
   ``You've got to have courage and faith in some absolute,'' says
Mithileshwar Singh, an India-born American resident dumped on a
Bierut street Oct. 3 after 20 months of captivity.
   ``It was to what I know of God and of myself in relation to God
that I had to turn in my 611 days,'' he said in an interview with
Religious News Service, one of his first since his sudden,
unexplained release.
   ``Everybody has an end to his strength. I was near the end of
mine. The others (still held) must be coming near the end of theirs,
too.''
   For the last six weeks, he has been staying at a Presbyterian
Church retreat center at Stony Point, N.Y., to ``collect myself, get
well and get ready to go to work.''
   Singh, 61, a business administration professor who has spent much
of his career teaching in the United States but was teaching at
Beirut University College when kidnapped, said:
   ``In the beginning, your span of endurance is large, but as time
goes on the span of time grows longer than the span of endurance.
You become mentally exhausted, confused, listless.''
   He said the he and three other hostages were kept together,
usually in handcuffs, by the Islamic Jihad (Holy War) Organization
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   In the 20 months, he said they were moved six times to different
locations, usually a room measuring about 10 by 12 feet, with food
adequare, a bath allowed once a week.
   ``Our captors listened to our physical and medical needs but they
did not listen to us as people,'' Singh said. ``To be a captive is
to have nobody to rely upon to give meaning to what you are going
through except for yourself.
   ``We had no meaning for the Jihad (kidnappers) as individuals,
only as representative figures.''
   Singh, a Hindu, said at one time to endure while ``very sick and
weak,'' he reached back to his adolescence in India when he once
continuously chanted mantras (a repetitious prayer form) for a week.
   ``So now again, in the room I shared with the other captives, I
turned to my mantra, wrapping my blanket over my head and chanting
softly,'' Singh relates.
   ``One million mantras I figure I said in that room. And as I said
them I grew grateful for the experience, the chance, to do again at
my age what I did in my youth.''
   It was the ``process of saying the mantra, of thinking of God and
of myself and the universe, that saved me, I think,'' he said.
   ``The point I am trying to make is that we as children, as
adolescents, as young people should not try to live in a
materialistic vacuum.
   ``We should develop our reservoirs of strength, of power, the
deep moorings of the self to which we can turn and cling for safety
in time of both adversity and prosperity.
   ``This ability comes out of a way of life, a lifestyle, and I am
afraid _ oh I hope I am wrong _ that young people today are not
building these moorings, not filling these reservoirs.''
   Singh, who taught for l0 years at the University of Western
Colorado and for two years and at the University of Wisconsin, said
``everybody, everywhere'' should press for release of the remaining
captives.
   Nine Americans are among 14 foreigners still held being held
prisoners in Lebanon.
   Singh said that during his captivity, he and three university
colleagues kept with him _ Jesse Turner, Alan Steen and Robert
Polhill _ worked on future plans and projects, all mentally, without
pencil or paper.
   In one project, Singe said he worked in his head on how to solve
challenges to education in America and India, each morning reviewing
and critiquing his previous day's work, and in the afternoon
advancing another step ahead.
   He said he now is eager to get to work on the two books he
already has written in his mind.
   In the first two weeks of their captivity, Singh said Jihad
leaders concentrated on interrogating the three, with ``vigorous
attempts'' to get them to admit ties to American intlligence
agencies.
   After that interlude, he said boredom became the rule, but at one
point they were told they would be executed at midnight if Jihad
demands were not met _ release of Palestinians held in Kuwait and in
Israel.
   But the deadline hour passed.
   ``I would not say that I am bitter over what I went through,''
Singh said. ``Through meditation, the experience brought me its own
rewards.''

   President Reagan, in a message for observance
of National Bible Week Nov. 20-27, says the Bible ``is the most
precious treasure yet entrusted to man.''
   ``Over the centuries, though empires have risen and fallen,
though civilizations have ebbed and flowed, the Bible has remained a
constant source of hope and inspiration,'' he says.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are honorary national chairman and
chairwoman of the week, an interfaith project emphasizing importance
of the Bible and promoting greater reading of it, including daily
passages recommended for the week.
   Reagan says the Bible ``shaped the ideas and formed the
consciences of many early Americans'' and nurtured ``a profound
belief in human dignity, in individual freedom and in the
inalienable rights of man...
   ``Unless we ... insure that the wonderful treasures of the Bible
are handed down to each new generation, we cannot, I believe, long
remain a `nation under God'.''

   ``Considering all of the scientific data collected through the

   With the promise of legal U.S. residency held
before them, thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants are
emerging from the shadows under which they harvested America's fresh
fruits and vegetables.
   In a last, desperate chance to become legal U.S. residents, many
of these farmworkers are using fraudulent documents to prove they
worked here before, thus qualifying for a legalization program that
ends Nov. 30.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service and organizations
working to help the mostly Mexican immigrants agree there is massive
fraud.
   But the organizations say the INS has developed a ``paranoia''
over the problem and has coerced applicants into signing
``confessions'' that their documents are phony.
   Immigration authorities deny the allegation.
   To qualify for legal residency under the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986, foreign farmhands must prove they harvested
fruits, vegetables or other perishable crops in the United States
for at least 90 days in a one-year period that ended May 1, 1986.
   The INS had estimated that 600,000 farm workers would apply.
Instead, the figure topped 1 million by the first week of November,
and up to 200,000 more are expected before the filing period ends
Nov. 30, according to Aaron Bodin, who heads the INS' Special
Agriculture Workers program.
   Under the initial phase of the legalization program, which ended
May 4, temporary residency was granted to more than 1.7 million
illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the United States
since Jan. 1, 1982.
   The INS admits the service was ill-prepared with budget and staff
because it underestimated the farmworkers' demand for legalization.
To complicate matters, Bodin said, many of the farmhands were unable
to obtain the documents they needed. So they turned to labor
contractors who hire illegal immigrants, many of whom wrote letters
to anyone who asked _ for a fee.
   ``Every time I call the INS, they're screaming fraud, fraud,
fraud,'' said Christine Brigagliano, an attorney for the non-profit
California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation in San Francisco. ``The
INS is going bonkers with this fraud stuff.''
   ``The farmworkers are being penalized for fraud when we have
created a wonderful black market here,'' Ms. Brigagliano said.
   Mary Lopez, the California-based director of the Martin Luther
King Jr. Farmworkers' Fund, said she received reports of people
paying up to $800 for a phony letter, with the average about $300.
   Bodin said the INS concern over fraud is not paranoia but
suspicion that half the undecided cases that have reached processing
centers may include phony papers.
   Nonetheless, he said, early statistics showed a 92 percent
approval rate for the first 325,000 applications reaching the
centers, where initial decisions are made. Rejections can be
appealed to Washington.
   Those qualifying for legalization under the 90-day prior work
provision will receive temporary residency cards, which will be
adjusted to permanent status in most cases on Dec. 1, 1990. The
immigrants are not required to work in agriculture once admitted.
   The program also is available to those who can show they worked
90 days in each of three years that ended May 1, 1986, and have
resided in the United States for at least six months for each of
those years. They can become permanent residents earlier _ Dec. 1,
1989.
   The agricultural program was included in the 1986 law at the
insistence of growers, especially in the West, who argued they
needed a pool of legal workers who could be ready to harvest
perishable crops on short notice.
   ``The real test is yet to come,'' said Mike Stuart, senior vice
president of the Western Growers Association. ``It will be in the
number of workers who remain working in agriculture.''
   Stuart suggested that those evaluating the program watch how many
newly legalized workers show up to pick strawberries in Orange
County, Calif., in January _ the first harvest after the deadline.
   But for thousands of farmhands seeking a better life, the test
begins when they appear at a U.S. immigration office.
   ``They're being harassed, treated without dignity, told they will
go to jail,'' said Ms. Lopez of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Farmworkers Fund.
   Bodin described most INS personnel as ``cordial, friendly and
trying to help'' but acknowledged their job was ``to determine the
credibility of the applicant.''
   He said farmworkers may find their interviews difficult because
they're victims of ``the labor market they've been in.''
   ``They were paid in cash, they rode around in a pickup truck,
they might not know the names of the farms they worked, only the
crew leader's first name,'' he said.
   ``We try to talk to the applicant and try to get a sense of his
credibility. We have gone the last mile. But we cannot simply take
peoples' word for it. The statute and the regulations require
documentary evidence.''

<HEAD>Gary Busey Plays Reporter in Miniseries About Fall of Marcos</HEAD>

   When HBO named its miniseries about the
revolution in the Philippines ``A Dangerous Life,'' it wasn't
supposed to describe the filming.
   ``When I got to Manila they gave me a three-page form to fill out
with very personal information to use in negotiations in case I was
abducted,'' said Gary Busey, who stars as a journalist in the
three-part, six-hour film airing on Home Box Office this Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday.
   ``A Dangerous Life,'' as seen through the eyes of a reporter,
tells of the 1986 ``people's revolution'' that brought down the
government of Ferdinand Marcos and brought Corazon Aquino to power
as president.
   During his 5{-week stay in the Philippines, Busey was accompanied
by four bodyguards and three trucks.
   Even so, Busey and the film company were forced to leave the
Philippines on short notice after Juan Ponce Enrile, the former
Minister of National Defense, obtained a court order halting
production, citing invasion of privacy. Another prominent military
officer also filed suit.
   ``All the judges of the Supreme Court were out of town,'' said
Busey. ``They gave us six hours to get out. We left under armed
guard. We went to Australia for the interiors then to Sri Lanka to
finish the exterior scenes. We finally won the case, but it took
months to come to trial.''
   Busey stars as Tony O'Neill, in Manila on assignment when he
witnesses the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino,
Mrs. Aquino's husband. Marcos' right-hand man, Gen. Fabian Ver, is
accused in the murder, but his acquittal spurs Cory Aquino to
challenge Marcos in the presidential election.
   Marcos wins the election amid charges of fraud. Most of the
military sides with Aquino, and Marcos is forced to flee.
   The miniseries also stars Rebecca Gilling as O'Neill's estranged
wife, a fellow journalist; Tessie Tomas as Imelda Marcos; Ruben
Rustia as Marcos; Laurice Guillen as Corazon Aquino, and Joonee
Gamboa as Enrile.
   A number of Filipino actors appear in the miniseries, Busey said.
``They were magnificent. They came prepared, they were very
disciplined. The focus of the series is a story about their country,
which was very important to them. Tessie Tomas, who plays Imelda,
used to do a one-woman show on her. Imelda loved it. These are
actors who are playing people who are still alive who have the
ability to get back at them.
   ``Some members of the cast were pro-Marcos and some were
pro-Aquino. We had a lot of tension. My character is a man who gets
caught up in the passion of the revolution. I talked to
correspondents who covered it. They were very emotional about it.
They stayed with the rebel troops. That's where the story was.
   ``I thought this was going to be easy, but it was like two
lifetimes doing this. I learned an awful lot. It was a rewarding
experience. I learned a lot about human nature and how democracy
works in a Third World country.''
   Busey talked about the film on a break from the theatrical
feature ``Hider in the House.'' He was in his trailer watching the
soap opera ``As the World Turns'' while on location in Duarte, about
25 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``I've been watching this for 25 years,'' he said. ``When I go to
New York I visit with these guys. I started watching when I was in
college in Coffeyville, Kansas. It's got everything _ sex,
blackmail, revenge. It's a great mental catharsis for an actor.''
   In ``Hider in the House,'' Busey plays a demented man who takes
up residence in the attic of a house being remodeled. The film
company was working at the site of an old house that was due to be
remodeled. The movie also stars Michael McKean and Mimi Rogers.

   As Air Force One began its descent into Carswell
Air Force Base, President John F. Kennedy glanced down through the
darkness. Amber lights silhouetted the Fort Worth skyline and gave
the city a friendly, festive glow.
   ``Spectacular,'' Kennedy told Congressman Jim Wright.
   The date was Nov. 21, 1963, and the presidential party had flown
to Fort Worth for the third stop on a whirlwind tour designed to end
the left-right squabbling among bitterly factionalized Texas
Democrats and secure the state for the presidential election the
following year.
   A crowd estimated at 6,000 greeted Kennedy and his wife,
Jacqueline, at Carswell, and thousands more lined the motorcade
route to the old Hotel Texas, where the president would spend his
final night.
   A 26-year-old AP reporter caught his first glimpse of an American
president that evening and, in that era of innocence, was every bit
as excited as a small-town West Texan should have been.
   Hours later, that AP reporter joined other numbed and dismayed
colleagues in covering the death of his president and the wounding
of Gov. John B. Connally. Just days later, he covered the slaying of
Lee Harvey Oswald and, drafted for the task, helped carry his body
to its grave.
   Then came the 1964 murder trial of Jack Ruby, the Ides of March
conviction, a death sentence and an appellate court ruling that set
the verdict aside. Ruby died of cancer before he could be retried.
   Through the years, there were interludes with Oswald's widow,
Marina, and turbulent, intriguing bouts with his mother, Marguerite,
whose favorite pastime was haranguing Fort Worth reporters.
   And always the conspiracy buffs, the researchers dedicated to
proving the Warren Commission's basic conclusion a lie, and not a
very convincing one at that.
   They insisted Oswald was not the killer or, at the very least,
was not the sole triggerman.
   In 1981, the conspiracies peaked with a trip to Rose Hill
Cemetery to dig up the body buried 18 years before in Oswald's
grave. A British author had claimed we had buried an impostor, a
Russian spy in fact. He was wrong. Forensic tests at Baylor
University Medical Center proved it was indeed Oswald.
   Although the echoes of gunfire in Dealey Plaza grow fainter with
each passing autumn, the events of November 1963 continue to touch
us all in mystifying ways and to different degrees.
   This month, there will be network and cable documentaries, new
books, an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former Peace
Corps volunteers and PT boat veterans. Millions of words will be
written.
   Still, Kennedy family members would prefer that remembrances of
the slain president be changed.
   ``They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' says Melody
Miller, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   What is the significance of this 25th anniversary and the
anniversaries that preceded it? Do we know the legacy of Dallas? Or
the lessons of 1963?
   Historians may one day pinpoint all this and more.
   But don't bet on it.

   Anyone old enough to read or watch television 25 years ago can
recite from memory the events of November 22.
   Kennedy spoke twice in Fort Worth that morning, first to a crowd
of 5,000 who had gathered in the rain in the hotel parking lot. Vice
President Lyndon Johnson and Connally joined him, but Jackie did not.
   ``It takes a little longer to put herself together, that's why
she's prettier than we are,'' the president joked with the cheering
crowd.
   Inside, Kennedy addressed a sold-out Chamber of Commerce
breakfast in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. That group totaled 2,050,
with 50 extra tickets allotted at the last minute to the black
community.
   No blacks, no breakfast speech, the White House said when told
the president would be addressing an all-white audience.
   It was Kennedy's final speech, but Jackie stole the show, looking
lovely and self-assured in a two-piece pink suit with matching
pillbox hat.
   Kennedy and his entourage then returned to Carswell for the short
flight to Dallas, where the president was to address a luncheon at
the Trade Mart.
   In Dallas, 200,000 people, many on lunch breaks, jammed the
streets to see the 46-year-old president and his 34-year-old wife.
Smiling and waving, Jackie sat at her husband's side as the
motorcade rolled through the canyons of downtown Dallas.
   Delighted and relieved by the big, friendly reception, Nellie
Connally, the governor's wife, turned from her seat in front of
Kennedy and said:
   ``No one can say Dallas doesn't love and respect you, Mr.
President.''
   ``You sure can't,'' he replied.
   Seconds later, the motorcade passed in front of the Texas School
Book Depository and into a sniper's cross hairs.

   The first year after the assassination was difficult for most
Americans. It was a nightmare for Texans, particularly those living
in Dallas.
   A number of publications found much to dislike about Texas and
most were mightily concerned with the so-called ``mood of Dallas''
and the accommodation granted its far-right fanatics in the
conservative mainstream.
   In an editorial headlined ``A Year Later,'' the Dallas Morning
News touched on the ``scathing and unjust criticism'' of Dallas and
observed how the city stood alone ``in the spotlight of unfavorable
conspicuousness.''
   The editorial did not mention the small but noisy element of
right-wingers whose agitation had prompted Kennedy's visit 12 months
before.
   Perhaps it was unimportant. What seemed to matter to the
newspaper was that hysteria and shock had subsided and the city
could move ahead with new resolve and high purpose.
   November 22 that year fell on a Sunday, and a still sorrowful
nation remembered Kennedy in prayers and memorial services across
the country.
   It had been a year of memorials.
   The U.S. Space Flight Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., was renamed
Cape Kennedy, but later was changed back. New York changed the name
of its international airport from Idlewild to John F. Kennedy.
   Congress authorized construction of a cultural center in
Washington to be named in Kennedy's honor, and Harvard University
announced plans for a Kennedy Memorial Library.
   By the end of the year, it seemed certain that more American
streets, avenues and boulevards would be named Kennedy than Main.

   The Dallas ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the
assassination was so brief and simple it almost slipped past
unnoticed.
   Fifty people gathered for the prayer service near the spot where
Kennedy was slain. A city official laid a wreath of red and white
carnations beside the bronze marker that tells the assassination
story.
   The news was dominated by the Vietnam war and the 1968 election.
Pain still lingered from the slayings earlier that year of Martin
Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

   By the 10th anniversary in 1973, reporters were getting lathered
up over Watergate. In Dallas, 500 people gathered near the
assassination site, but the top news story of the day was an
18-minute gap in a Nixon White House tape recording.
   The JFK focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories, fed by
books and a movie called ``Executive Action'' that laid blame for
the Kennedy killing on a group of greedy Texas oilmen.
   ``There's nothing new. My view is the same _ Oswald did all the
shooting,'' retired district attorney Henry Wade said in an
interview last month. ``I haven't seen anything to change my mind. I
feel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought that
somebody ought to kill him (Kennedy) while in town. But there is
absolutely no proof of anything like that.''
   Fifteen years ago, Wade, who would have prosecuted Oswald had he
lived, was less certain.
   ``I find it hard to believe that Oswald didn't have help,'' he
told the AP in 1973. ``Call it a gut feeling on my part. I don't
have any evidence to back it up. But I believe there was a
conspiracy. You just don't go downtown one morning and kill the
president.''
   The widow of J.D. Tippit, the police officer Oswald shot after
fleeing the school book warehouse, had remarried by the 10th
anniversary. A lawyer said the $600,000 she received from a
sympathetic public after Tippit's death went into a trust for their
three children.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the spartan fifth anniversary, the landmark 20th touched
all bases.
   Movies, television specials, documentaries, books, magazine
articles and news stories explored the assassination anew.
   In 1963, Marina Oswald, at age 22, was a stranger in a foreign
land, a frightened young woman with few friends, no money, no job,
no future, two infant daughters and a dead husband accused of
killing the president of the United States.
   ``It was horrible,'' she told the AP 20 years later.
   ``For a while I thought it would all blow over, just go away. But
now I accept the fact that I must live with this for the rest of my
life.''
   Less than two years after the assassination, Marina married
Kenneth Porter, a carpenter, and they moved to a country house north
of Dallas.
   She was then and remains today uncertain of Oswald's guilt and
whether he acted alone. She initially agreed with the Warren
Commission that Oswald was the lone assassin, but doubts crept in
and she later changed her mind.
   But, she told the AP, ``I don't have any desire to waste the rest
of my life trying to prove something that cannot be proven.''
   There are those, however, who are obsessed with doing precisely
that.
   In 1983, an AP story first pulled together theories about the
Black Dog Man, the Umbrella Man, the Mafia Con Man, the Tall Tramp
and a man called Frenchy. The article also looked at publications
called ``The Continuing Inquiry,'' ``Coverups!'' and ``Echoes of
Conspiracy.''
   Those are names and newsletters well-known to the self-described
``theorists'' or ``critics'' who claim there is a sinister and still
secret story behind the assassination.
   They raise provocative questions but provide few answers.
   That brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories.
   A British television documentary entitled ``The Men Who Killed
Kennedy,'' broadcast Oct. 25, claimed three gangsters from
Marseilles, France, assassinated Kennedy on orders from U.S.
organized crime.
   The two-hour documentary on Central Television identified the
purported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in Mexico
in 1972, a second was working in Colombia's drug trade and the third
was living in Marseilles after his recent release from prison.
   But the day after the program aired, a Marseilles newspaper
assembled records indicating that two of them could not have been in
Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963; one was serving on a minesweeper from Oct.
16, 1962, to April 16, 1964, according to French navy headquarters,
and another was in a Marseilles jail cell that day, according to the
Justice Ministry.
   In addition, the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran as
saying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day of
the assassination.
   The program was based on a four-year inquiry by American writer
and researcher Steve Rivele and the program's British director,
Nigel Turner.
   In this country, a syndicated television report is reviving the
theory that Kennedy's assassination was an act of revenge by
Lousiana mob boss Carlos Marcello, who was deported in 1961 by
then-U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The program, presented by
reporter Jonathan Kwitny, was broadcast in New York Nov. 1 and will
air elsewhere this month.
   The report said evidence indicated that Oswald and Ruby had
connections to Marcello: Oswald through his uncle, who purportedly
worked for the Marcello organization, and Ruby through drug
trafficking, which would have been controlled by Marcello.
   In a two-hour television special Nov. 2, columnist Jack Anderson
argued another theory involving the Mafia, that Kennedy was a victim
of underworld figures first hired by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro.
Anderson's special says Santo Trafficante, mob boss in Havana before
Castro took power in 1959, double-crossed the CIA and informed
Castro.
   Castro then made a deal with Trafficante to kill Kennedy,
Anderson theorized. Trafficante allegedly enlisted the suppport of
two other bosses, Marcello and Sam Giancana, and Oswald was set up
as the fall guy. Anderson's special also linked Ruby to the Mafia
plot.

   Back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in Dealey
Plaza, the media struggled to define the mood of Dallas and how the
city's right-wing tolerance might have figured in the assassination.
   They apparently failed.
   D Magazine, a slick Dallas monthly, unveiled its November 1988
issue with this cover: ``25 Years Later: Did Dallas Kill Kennedy?''
   Inside, there is a story entitled ``Was Dallas a City of Hate?''
   The debate goes on.
   Robert H. Johnson Jr., the AP's Texas bureau chief who directed
the news agency's assassination coverage, wrote the AP's first
startling words:
   ``BULLETIN
   ``DALLAS (AP) _ President Kennedy was shot today just as his
motorcade left downtown Dallas. Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed
Mr. Kennedy. She cried, `Oh, no!' The motorcade sped on.''
   Johnson, recently retired and living in New Mexico, remained in
Texas for six years after the shootings. Never once, he said, did he
drive past the book depository without getting a ``prickly feeling''
on the back of his neck.
   ``I still feel it,'' he said after a visit to Dallas this year.
``The event has got some kind of hold on Americans ... and many
foreigners as well. It's hard to explain.''
   Barbara Womble cannot explain it either. But she vividly
remembers the look on her fifth-grade teacher's face when he
dismissed his pupils in Chicopee Falls, Mass., that November
afternoon.
   ``Just by his expression, we knew something really big had
happened,'' she says now.
   Ms. Womble, 35, now director of marketing at upscale Highland
Park Village shopping complex in Dallas, said the whole issue is
muddled because the case has never been solved.
   ``But to me, the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regret
is to discuss them openly and repeatedly,'' she said. ``They just
don't vanish.''

   Americans rank John F. Kennedy as the nation's
greatest president, remembering him with a striking sense of loss a
quarter-century after his assassination, a Media General-Associated
Press poll has found.
   But Kennedy's exalted place in history rests more on his
potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in
office. In the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma
than on other attributes.
   Slightly more than one-fifth of the 1,125 adults surveyed picked
Kennedy as the greatest U.S. president, more than named any other.
Only Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln came close in
popularity.
   Among all respondents, a plurality rated Kennedy as a good
president, not a great one. Still, a majority said they believed
that had he lived and served a second term, the United States would
be a better place today.
   Kennedy, at 43 the youngest president elected, served nearly
three years before he was shot and killed in a Dallas motorcade Nov.
22, 1963. Twenty-five years later, his name is invoked and his words
are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of popularity.
   In more recent years, the Kennedy image crumbled a bit with
reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a Mafia boss.
In the survey, Kennedy's judgment was rated lower than other
qualities.
   Most striking, however, was the depth of feeling associated with
the slain president. More than six in 10 respondents said they still
felt a personal loss from Kennedy's assassination, including many
who were children or were not yet born in 1963. Among his
contemporaries, seven in 10 feel a loss.
   In another gauge, the poll asked if respondents remembered where
they were when they heard Kennedy had been killed. Of those 30 and
older now _ meaning they were at least 5 years old then _ more than
90 percent said yes.
   To order the pantheon of presidents, the survey asked: ``Who do
you think was the greatest American president?'' Kennedy was named
by 21 percent; Lincoln and Roosevelt, 17 percent each; Harry Truman
and Ronald Reagan, 7 percent each. Kennedy has led similar lists in
other polls over the years.
   Kennedy was most popular with 30- to 44-year-olds, who were
children or teen-agers when he served; nearly a third of them called
him the greatest president. In other ratings as well, that group
viewed Kennedy especially favorably.
   Kennedy, who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the South,
also was rated particularly highly by blacks. Eight in 10 felt a
personal loss from his death, and 60 percent of blacks called him a
great president, compared to 31 percent of whites.
   Overall, a third of respondents said Kennedy was a great
president and 40 percent said a good one. He did better with
Democrats and the less-educated, and as the first Roman Catholic
president, he was rated highly by Catholics.
   Kennedy also was more popular with liberals, but his standing to
a great degree transcended ideology. He achieved his high ratings
even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal, while only 15
percent identified themselves as liberals.
   To gauge the components of Kennedy's image, the poll took
measures _ excellent, good, fair or poor _ of his accomplishments as
president, his potential for accomplishments had he not been
assassinated, and his leadership, judgment and charisma.
   Although he was rated highly in all categories, Kennedy drew far
and away the best ratings for his charisma _ 60 percent excellent.
Next were his leadership and his potential, both rated excellent by
39 percent.
   But Kennedy's excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments
and his judgment: In both, about two in 10 said excellent. Half said
good, but in his only sizable negative scores, more than a fifth
rated him just fair in both categories.
   There was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings. Fifty-two
percent overall said the nation would be a better place had Kennedy
lived and served a second term; that included 68 percent of the
Democrats polled, compared to 34 percent of the Republicans.
   Doubts emerged on the specific issue of Vietnam. About a third
said Kennedy would have prevented the United States from becoming
deeply involved in the fighting there, but 44 percent said not. The
rest didn't know.
   The survey found considerable familiarity with Kennedy; more than
half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal about
him. But such awareness waned among younger adults: Of those 18-29,
only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the former
president.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in
the continental United States. Each phone number was selected
randomly by computer, and the interviews was conducted with the
adult who'd had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every
adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the
poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
   The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ 5 points, for
example, for Democrats.
   Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and
order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this
poll; because of rounding, some may not total exactly 100:

   In the rugged Rogue River Valley of southern
Oregon, the few people who had contact with Irwin Lehrer knew him as
a man of few words.
   But when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Lehrer took
a pen and with a trembling hand but strong heart wrote a rare
letter, to the first lady.
   ``I am just an old man living by myself way up in the
mountains,'' he wrote. ``John F. Kennedy was the best president we
ever had and you are the most wonderful woman in the world. Anyone
(tries) to tell me different has me to whip. Twin fawns come in my
yard to eat feed I put out for them. One's name is Caroline the
other John John.''
   Lehrer's letter is now in a special file at the John F. Kennedy
Library, created by the National Archives from condolences sent to
Jacqueline Kennedy.
   Most of the 300,000 pages of letters, selected from about 3
million pages, are still being catalogued. But the couple hundred
already on file reveal, in simple, touching and rarely mawkish
prose, how deeply personal the Kennedy presidency and passing was
for average Americans.
   There are letters from heads of state and celebrities, but most
are from the likes of a self-proclaimed ``nobody'' housewife from
St. Louis; from a retarded boy in Riverside, Calif., who labored for
an hour to print his 45 words; from a woman from Ripley, Tenn., who
said that because of Kennedy many Southerners no longer accept an
old saying that ``a child born of a black mama and a black papa, his
days will always be unhappy.''
   The most frequent reflections are on JFK's vigor and humor, his
efforts on behalf of the mentally handicapped and minorities, and
his handling of the Cuban missile crisis.
   Some letters note special personal connections: Lewis Cagle of
Tennessee, for instance, whose life sentence Kennedy commuted three
days before the assassination, and a crippled woman from Boston whom
Kennedy once gave a ride when he spotted her struggling to keep up
with marchers in a parade in his honor.
   Several of the dozen letter writers contacted 25 years later had
only vague recollections of what they had written Mrs. Kennedy. But
memories of the assassination and the president were strong and
little changed.
   Deborah Lynn Dills of Fort Worth, Texas, had written at the age
of 12 to Mrs. Kennedy: ``When I heard your husband's speech that
fatal morning I was glowing with pride because of the nice things he
said about Texans. But now I am ashamed that I am a Texan. I wish I
was not one.''
   Dills is now a pediatric nurse who's back in love with her home
state but unremitting in her devotion to a president and a period
she believes ``was the last time people really felt proud.''
   She recalled getting the news of the assassination while in
physical education class. She cried. ``And then I remember a girl
saying `Good,' and (my) turning around and busting her one.''
   Judy Knight of Orlando, Fla., wrote as a high school senior that
she was ``a bigot'' until Kennedy inspired her with his civil rights
stands and other programs. And the riveting media attention given
the assassination helped steer her to a career in communications.
   Now, as a producer and writer for a commercial film company in
Washington, D.C., she says ``this current Washington scene is a very
cruel comparison to what that was. ... We're all waiting for
something like him to come back ... some part of us that feels if
the right person would step out we'd have Camelot again.''
   Virginia Chetwynd of Melrose, Mass., told the AP, ``This country
simply turned around and got lousy when the both of them went,''
referring to Kennedy and his brother, Robert.
   Her condolences to the first lady included an account of her
mother, a polio victim, once being given a ride by Kennedy. ``It was
the highlight of her life. She clipped and cut out everything in the
papers about him. It was like he was her own boy.''
   The letters to Mrs. Kennedy often include notes like ``you'll
probably never see this.'' But she read thousands of them, and
notations on some indicate that ``JBK'' found this one or that one
especially touching.
   In fact, it was Mrs. Kennedy who promised almost 25 years ago
that such a file, expected to be completed and available to
researchers next year, would be created.
   She inspired many of the letters. Actor Brian Keith, for example,
wrote the day after Christmas 1963 that her courage had helped him
and his wife when they lost a son nine days earlier.
   The letters also shared with her glimpses of the backyard
tributes that went on around America.
   Mrs. G.W. Robinson of Deerfield, Ill., wrote how her 14-year-old
son returned to a tree house he had long since outgrown. He raised a
flag from a halyard there. ``And every morning in the cold dawn
before school he raised it, lowered it to half staff, and in the
chill afternoon quietly took it down.''
   Cynthia Biever of Nappanee, Ind., wrote that ``our neighbor
children named our favorite shortcut path Kennedy Lane. We
christened it and everything.''
   A quarter of a century later, and now Cynthia Montgomery of
Ludington, Mich., she had little memory of the event, but she
believes Kennedy ``was an influence in many of the major things of
my life, such as being active and aware politically.''
   At Peninsula High School, in Gig Harbor, Wash., teacher Ruth
Crook wrote, ``The news came just before I was due to teach
Shelley's `Ode to a Skylark.' (You were at the hospital.) Numb,
cold, choked, I put it to the class: `What do you do? Go home?'
There was silence, and no face registered anything at all. Then a
boy, very quietly, without waiting for recognition, said, `No, we're
Americans. Let's do the work we have to do.'''
   An Indian chief from Sun Valley, Calif., offered his sympathy and
then said he had asked the great spirit of his people to provide
``plenty of soft spruce boughs for his rest at night.'' He also said
that from now on, ``the gentle breeze will be his touch, the
rippling of running water his smile, and the song of birds his
voice.''
   A few letters were sent to people in the administration.
Reclusive author J.D. Salinger sent a telegram to presidential press
secretary Pierre Salinger, no relation: ``My wife and I simply ache
for an effectual way to send Mrs. Kennedy and the children our love
and to say that we would be inexpressibly grateful for a way to be
of some comfort or use to them. Surely everyone in the world must be
heartbroken tonight.''
   Some of the letters were just dropped off at the gravesite. One
signed by ``Just Another American'' concluded, ``Good-bye my chief,
my leader, my captain. Good-bye, my president. Good-bye.''

   Oh, how the world has changed in 25 years.
   Then, McDonald's bragged ``Over a Billion Hamburgers Sold from
Coast to Coast,'' now it's simply ``billions and billions.'' The
Chrysler Theater was on the air, the Weavers were on their farewell
performance tour, and George Lincoln Rockwell and his American Nazi
Party were peddling hate. In those days of the quickening civil
rights movement, blacks still were referred to in newspapers as
Negroes.
   In 1963, ``superb men's suits'' sold in the Robert Hall clothing
chain for $39.95, sirloin strip steaks went for $1.39 a pound, a
quart of Dewar's White Label was $6.39. Snow tires on sale were
$10.22, wheel balancing and mounting free. Joe Palooka and Terry and
The Pirates were in the funnies and so was Pogo. Condoms were sold
in gas station restroom vending machines or from under the counter
in drug stores. Boys still blushed when they asked for them.
   Tempus fugit. Time flies.
   It stood still that day in Dallas when John F. Kennedy was
killed. But the world that he knew _ and that knew him _ is a
different world today.
   Then, it cost $950 to send a kid to a state college, $1,907 to a
private school _ room, board and tuition. Now those figures are
$4,445 and $11,330.
   Northern Rhodesia of Kennedy's day is Zambia. Southern Rhodesia
is Zimbabwe. The United Nations' 113 member states have grown to
159, the world's population from 3.2 billion to more than 5 billion,
America's from 189 million to 244 million.
   China, then an outcast, a technological pygmy, now bids to launch
American satellites. The Soviet Union, which rattled the nuclear
saber and blustered ``we will bury you'' in Kennedy's time, is
working with the United States to reduce the number of horrible
weapons.
   At the time of Kennedy's Cuban missile crisis, the United States
had 5,000 nuclear weapons, the Soviets only 300. Now each country
has over 25,000.
   Kennedy revived Depression-era food stamps as a pilot program;
now 19 million people use them. The number of farms in the United
States has fallen by more than 1 million, to fewer than 2.2 million.
   Baseball's major leagues crossed the border to embrace Montreal
and Toronto. Oakland, Seattle, San Diego and Atlanta got into the
majors and so have Arlington, Texas, halfway between Dallas and Fort
Worth, and Anaheim, Calif., home of Disneyland. The nation's game,
however, is no longer played professionally in the nation's capital.
   If you were shopping for early Christmas presents in 1963 you
could choose from wood tennis rackets, home movie projectors,
portable typewriters, most of which can still be gotten but who
needs them in the days of graphite rackets, camcorders and laptop
computers?
   You couldn't buy a telephone then; you can now.
   When people talked about using ``calculators,'' they meant slide
rules or adding machines. You could take the SS France to Europe,
buy a VW bug, which everyone thought would be around forever. Cars
from Japan? Don't be silly.
   In 1963, Jack Nicklaus became the second golfer ever to make
$100,000 _ Arnie Palmer, of course, was the first. But that was
before television invented Sunday afternoons. Last year Curtis
Strange set the record for a single season, winning $925,941.
   Buddhist priests were dousing themselves with gasoline and
setting themselves afire in Vietnam. Kennedy had sent in 16,000
advisers, the advance contingent for America's longest and most
controversial war that saw 543,400 troops there at the high point.
More than 58,000 young Americans lost their lives.
   People have become famous who weren't born yet or were
pre-schoolers when Kennedy was killed. Michael J. Fox, the actor;
Amy Carter, the presidential daughter; Jose Canseco, the World
Series ballplayer; Mike Tyson, the heavyweight champion; Carl Lewis,
the runner; Greg Louganis, the diver. Among the teen-agers of that
day, Steven Jobs, the computer whiz; Albert Gore, the senator; Dan
Quayle, the vice presidential nominee.
   John Kennedy's federal budget proposal for 1964 envisioned
spending $98.8 billion, a record, with $11.9 billion in red ink. The
deficit built into in Ronald Reagan's 1989 proposal _ $129.5 billion
_ is more than the entire Kennedy budget.
   The debt ceiling was $315 billion. It is now _ hold your breath _
$2.8 trillion. That's 2,800 billion dollars. Or: $2,800,000,000,000.
   Eastern Airlines reported a net 1962 loss of $14,895,365. What's
changed there? In 1987, the airline lost $181.7 million. Standard of
New Jersey had earnings of $84 million; now, as Exxon, its earnings
are $4.84 billion.
   Mary Haworth has left the advice column field to Ann and Abby,
the Nash Rambler has gone the way of the Studebaker, the DeSoto and
the dodo bird, and the United States population has moved inexorably
west and south, so that between 1960 and 1980 its center moved from
6{ miles northwest of Centralia, Ill., to one-quarter mile west of
DeSoto in Missouri.
   Lunch counters were still closed to blacks when John Kennedy was
in the White House. To vote in most of the South, one had to pay a
poll tax. Drinking fountains were labeled ``white'' and ``colored.''
   In 1988, 6,829 elected officials across the nation are black,
including 301 mayors and 429 judges of state courts. In 43 states,
Martin Luther King's birthday is a holiday.
   Only two of the Supreme Court justices of Kennedy's time, William
J. Brennan and Byron White, still sit on the bench. And eight men
who were serving in the Senate still are there, including Kennedy's
youngest brother, Ted.
   Around the world, a handful of national leaders who were in power
in Kennedy's time remain. Fidel Castro in Cuba, Alfredo Stroessner
in Paraguay, King Hussein in Jordan, and Kim Il-Sung in North Korea.
Bobby Kennedy is gone, but his son is in the House of
Representatives. JFK's son, John Jr., who saluted bravely as his
father's coffin passed, is a strapping, handsome 28-year-old.
   In 1963, 77 percent of American homes had television sets; 98
percent do today. And three out of four homes had telephones; now 93
out of 100 homes have them.
   More than half of all homes have video cassette recorders, which
were virtually unknown then. Radios have multiplied: 156 million in
1963 and 530 million now. There is no change in older folks'
complaints about the younger generation's taste in music.
   Kennedy had committed the nation to going to the moon in the
decade of the '60s, and it did, but when he died only six Americans
had gone into space. Since then, 12 Americans have walked on the
moon and, in all, 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 U.S. space
flights. The Soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights. They
have female astronauts, and so have we.
   In 1963, there was no transplanting of hearts, but there was
cocky confidence that virtually any infection could be controlled
with antibiotics and chemicals. That was before toxic shock
syndrome, Legionnaire's disease and now, the dread AIDS.
   Tempus fugit. John F. Kennedy's beautiful young wife is a
grandmother. The world has changed. The torch, as he said, has
passed.

   In fairy tales, the beautiful princess marries
the handsome prince and they live happily ever after.
   But Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis' fairy tale
short-circuited on a warm day in Dallas when her pink suit was
splattered with her prince's blood. In the ensuing 25 years, she has
had to write her own happy ending.
   The plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the
adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the
national widow. Her 1968 marriage to Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle
Onassis engendered outrage, and her penchant for privacy has bred
some resentment.
   But once a year, she kneels alone at Arlington National Cemetery.
And once again she becomes the stoic, black-veiled widow who stood
at that spot in November 1963 to bury her husband, President John F.
Kennedy.
   ``One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness,'' she once
said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It is important to remember what Jackie Kennedy was to America
and to the world. She was the glamorous, whispery-voiced brunette
whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husband's _ so
much so that he laughingly introduced himself as Jackie's escort.
   She was the fashion plate whose designer dresses, pillbox hats
and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her hatless
husband wounded the fedora trade.
   ``We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to
Mrs. Kennedy's beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and
symbolism,'' said Oleg Cassini, her official designer.
   She was the young hostess of a televised tour of the White House,
the graduate of Miss Porter's School and Vassar who said her prime
responsibility was to ``take care of the president so he can best
serve the people.'' She was 34 years old when JFK died, a striking
contrast to her matronly predecessors, Bess Truman and Mamie
Eisenhower.
   Most of all, she was mistress of Camelot.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   She forfeited that title when she married Onassis, the aging
Greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant Kennedy. Many said
she was a golddigger; she never explained the marriage publicly,
never responded to such headlines as ``Jackie: How Could You?''
   ``She, by surviving and being with him (JFK) when he died so
dramatically, became a legend in her own lifetime,'' said a friend,
Paul Mathias. ``And she cannot live up to it because no human being
could.''
   The marriage foundered quickly, and Ari and Jackie lived separate
lives. When he died in 1975, he left her $120,000 in his will; she
won a $26 million settlement from the Onassis family.
   At the same time, stories about JFK's escapades while he was
president began to spread _ stories about alleged liaisons with
Marilyn Monroe and the mistress of mobster Sam Giancana. And others
suggested that JFK's most lasting legacy was the war in Vietnam.
   Camelot wasn't what it used to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   With her millions, Jackie Onassis could have done absolutely
nothing, enjoying her 14-room apartment on upper Fifth Avenue, her
estate in Bernardsville, N.J., and the oceanfront compound on
Martha's Vineyard while raising her two children, Caroline and John
Jr.
   Instead, she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for
Doubleday & Co. She works there 3{ days a week _ producing ideas and
acquiring books from authors and agents, then guiding the writing of
manuscripts.
   Her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment, never
politics. Her bestsellers have included Michael Jackson's
autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' and ballerina Gelsey Kirkland's
``Dancing on My Grave.''
   ``I think people who work themselves have respect for the work of
others,'' she has said.
   Her salary, reportedly $40,000-50,000 a year, is a pittance of
her net worth _ estimated at around $50 million, plus $200,000 a
year from a trust fund bequeathed by Kennedy.
   She has made some public appearances in recent years. She has
supported efforts to save city landmarks like Grand Central
Terminal, attending news conferences but saying little and slipping
out through freight entrances.
   On her infrequent appearances at social galas, she often dons the
designs of Carolina Herrera. Her date is usually longtime friend
Maurice Tempelsman, 58, a Belgian-born diamond dealer and
international businessman.
   On autumn weekends, Mrs. Onassis sometimes rides with the Essex
Hunt Club, near her Bernardsville estate. She often is among the
spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby Peapack; she does
not mingle with the locals.
   She has been seen sailing and waterskiing off Martha's Vineyard
with Tempelsman, but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a
scarf and sunglasses. Her island house is at the end of a 2,000-foot
driveway.
   The signs out front say ``No Trespassing.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Onassis' battles with paparazzi are legendary. She
repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer
Ron Galella, first obtaining a court order barring Galella from
coming within 30 feet of her or her children, then going to court to
enforce that order.
   She declines all interviews, according to her spokeswoman, Nancy
Tuckerman. She would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the
assassination; she will not speak on the quarter-century anniversary.
   But occasionally, New Yorkers catch glimpses. One newspaper
recently showed Jackie, a still youthful-looking grandmother,
crossing a street while engrossed in a book, oblivious to the
photographer. Even celebrity-immune New Yorkers stare when they spot
her jogging in Central Park or shopping on Madison Avenue.
   ``You have two compartments. Your private and your public life,''
she once explained. ``I think I'm more of a private person. I don't
really like to call attention to anything.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after the assassination, after Jackie's fall
from grace with a Greek, after revelations about the Kennedy era and
after her determined efforts to maintain her privacy, a poll asked
Americans to list their most admired first ladies.
   First was Eleanor Roosevelt, the most active of all president's
wives. Second was Nancy Reagan, whose anti-drug campaign was the
stuff of current headlines.
   And third was Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis.

   When John F. Kennedy Jr. took the podium at the
Democratic National Convention in July, the national memory drifted
back nearly 25 years, to the mind's image of a 3-year-old boy
saluting his father's horse-drawn caisson.
   But this was no ``John-John'' on the stage in Atlanta. This was a
darkly handsome, well-spoken law student who would soon be declared
America's sexiest man by a national magazine; this was a 28-year-old
millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with the poor.
   More than a quarter-century has passed since Kennedy and his
sister, Caroline, now 30, charmed the nation with their Oval Office
shenanigans.
   They endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and their
Uncle Bobby in 1968. They adjusted when their mother married Greek
shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968.
   Still, by all reports John and Caroline thrived _ they did well
in private schools, became proficient in sports, made lasting
friendships and avoided the drugs that so twisted the lives of some
of their cousins.
   Like their mother, both Kennedy children guard their privacy and
decline all interview requests, said family spokeswoman Nancy
Tuckerman.
   Caroline Kennedy earned a fine arts degree at Harvard, then
served as manager and coordinating producer of the office of film
and television at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She
abandoned a career in photojournalism because other people aimed
cameras at her every time she tried to take pictures.
   She married author-artist Edwin Schlossberg in July 1986. After a
$1,250-a-week internship in 1987 as a summer associate at a New York
law firm, she graduated from Columbia University law school in May.
She gave birth to a daughter, Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, on June 25.
   Her brother has kept a more public profile.
   Now an athletic 6-foot-1, with matinee-idol good looks, Kennedy
recently was named by People magazine as ``the sexiest man alive.''
   Like his father, Kennedy has been described as extremely shy,
although he did make a few campaign speeches when his cousin, Joseph
P. Kennedy II, ran for Congress.
   Kennedy acted in two productions at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., where he graduated in 1982.
   In the summer of 1985, he starred in a revival of a play called
``Winners,'' staged and directed by his fellow Brown graduates at
the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. His co-star was Christina Haag,
an actress and his steady girlfriend of the past two years. They
have known each other since they were both 15.
   There have been no theatrical experiences since. ``Acting is just
a hobby,'' he once told a reporter.
   While an undergraduate, Kennedy spent a summer traveling in
southern Africa, where Maurice Tempelsman, his mother's friend, has
mining and manufacturing interests.
   Another summer he worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala.
Later, he spent six months working with the poor in India.
   In 1984, he began his first job, in the New York City Office of
Business Development. He also spent one summer as a $1,100-a-week
intern at a Los Angeles law firm.
   The young Kennedy, who lives in a modest apartment in Greenwich
Village, is a millionaire, thanks to a trust fund left by his father
and the settlement his mother made with the Onassis estate.
   Although he has no personal recollection of the White House days
_ he was only 3 when his father was killed _ he majored in American
history in college, has studied his father's administration and is a
member of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
   Despite speculation about a possible political future, he has
steadfastly denied having any definite career plans beyond New York
University Law School, where he is completing his final year.

   With varying success, new video remembrances of
John F. Kennedy reflect the magic and the fears of his 1,000 days in
the White House.
   They're most effective when they show the young president
speaking for himself _ in the witty repartee at news conferences,
for instance _ and when they let real-time recordings register the
grief at his death _ a reporter's voice breaking as he dictates from
Dallas, a waiter sobbing into a starched napkin at the luncheon
where JFK was headed that day.
   One-hour biographies can hardly tell a life story like Kennedy's.
In the end, these retrospectives seem to move too fast, missing
milestones.
   In presenting his personal life, they show the outdoorsman
sailing or playing touch football, the father cuddling his kids, the
dashing husband of a dazzling wife, the portrait that made the
Camelot myth. The tabloids' man of clay is nowhere to be found.
   Still, it's nice to hear a president straightforwardly admit a
big mistake, as Kennedy does a year or so after the Bay of Pigs.
It's nice to feel the energy of an administration that holds a
summit with the Soviet leader within six months of taking office.
It's nice to see, again and again, that oh-so-easy smile.
   Here are glimpses of the new videos:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>``JFK in His Own Words,'' HBO Video, $19.99</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The most personal of the remembrances, this one used 200 hours of
film and, at least as importantly, 300 hours of voice recordings, so
JFK is heard narrating his life.
   At one point, as he's seen reviewing troops and meeting with
advisers, the familiar voice confides: ``The responsibilities placed
on the United States are greater than I imagined them to be; and
there are greater limitations upon our ability to bring about a
favorable result than I imagined. ... It's much easier to make the
speeches than it is to finally make the judgments.''
   There are lighter moments in the film, which will air on HBO
cable in November. During a televised call-in show when he's running
for the Senate, a caller suggests his wife would make a better
senator. The smile. Then, ``I agree with that. But in any case, I
have the benefit of her advice. So, maybe I'll improve.''

   David L. Wolper was executive producer of this documentary-style
effort, first released the year after the assassination. Under a
foreboding musical score, it follows the movements of JFK and of Lee
Harvey Oswald, effectively splicing news film with re-enactments by
people who played supporting parts: a cab driver who picked up
Oswald, the shoe-shop owner who spotted the fugitive and tipped
police.
   Waiting for the motorcade, the camera looks through a scope and
fixes the crosshairs on passing traffic.
   The script is full of detail: the Secret Service had checked the
table decorations at the luncheon JFK was going to and would select
his steak at random from 2,500. The elegant language of the script

   A French diplomat, quoting Stendahl, called Kennedy ``a brilliant
maybe,'' and that neutrality is the theme here, as ABC News' Peter
Jennings narrates.
   This documentary traces the presidential years, using effective
clips from speeches to show JFK's inspiring style but noting that,
for example, in civil rights reform he waited until unrest pushed
him to act. ``Halfway through his presidency the New Frontier had
remained unconquered,'' Jennings says.
   JFK built up troop numbers in Vietnam but took the first steps
toward co-existence with the Soviets. Toward the end, he was
focusing on peace. ``Our most basic common link,'' says Kennedy's
voice-over, ``is that we all inhabit this planet, we all breathe the
same air, we all cherish our children's future, and we are all
mortal.''

   Produced by CBS News, this three-segment documentary summarizes
the White House years, replays CBS coverage of the assassination,
and concludes with an interview with Rose Kennedy, the president's
mother.
   In an intimate Oval Office interview two months after the Cuban
missile crisis, JFK gives a glimpse into history: ``The 15 people,
more or less, who were directly consulted frequently changed their
views, because whatever action we took had so many disadvantages and
each one we took had raised the prospect that it might escalate with
the Soviet Union into a nuclear war. ...
   ``If we'd had to act on the Wednesday, in the first 24 hours, I
don't think probably we would have chosen as prudently as we did.''
   Mrs. Kennedy says Jack as a boy was denied supper if he was late.
``He would promptly go to the kitchen where the cook, who loved him
very much, did serve him his meal. And I'm afraid that was the way
he was the greater part of his life: he would charm people into
giving in to him.''

   Behind locked doors at the National Archives
sit hundreds of dusty boxes, the product of the House of
Representatives' two-year investigation of the John F. Kennedy and
Martin Luther King Jr. slayings.
   A decade has passed since the House Select Committee on
Assassinations ended its work by concluding that Kennedy and King
were apparently the victims of conspiracies, but the committee
documents, which scholars say would be important research tools,
appear no closer to being opened to the public.
   ``What we're talking about is the records of our political
history _ two of the most important events of the 20th century,''
said Kevin Walsh, a former committee aide who has led a small group
of private Kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records.
   ``This is about the public's right to know.''
   Most of the work conducted by the Warren Commission, which
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the Kennedy slaying,
has been opened to the public, a move that has helped researchers
evaluate _ and in many cases strongly criticize _ that investigation.
   But the House committee, the only government investigation to
conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder, ran out
of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents.
   Without such a vote, the materials fell under the House's
so-called ``50-year rule,'' keeping congressional documents under
lock and key for a half-century.
   The late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, R-Conn., a member of the
select committee, had taken up the scholars' cause in Congress,
fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents. But he
died in 1987.
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, the committee chairman, originally led
opposition to that resolution, but had a change of heart after
McKinney's death, from AIDS, and said he would work for the
information's release.
   That buoyed researchers, but the 1988 legislative session came
and went without any action on the committee documents.
   House counsel Steven R. Ross said he expected Stokes to act next
year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records,
but he declined to provide specifics.
   The committee sent shockwaves around the world in December 1978
when it concluded that Kennedy's killing in 1963 was probably the
result of a conspiracy _ pointing to accoustic evidence that experts
said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman. The committee
also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the King slaying
in Memphis five years later.
   But in 1982, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that
there was no evidence of a second Kennedy gunman and that the
independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a
tape recording made from a motorcycle policeman's open microphone.
The experts' testimony had been the key to the committee's
conclusion; before it, the panel had planned to conclude that there
was no conspiracy.
   Despite the academy study and the Justice Department's final
conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either slaying,
Stokes stands by his committee's report.
   ``It's a difference between scientists,'' Stokes said.

<HEAD>After 25 Years, Dallas Finally Able to Open Sixth Floor Assassin's
Perch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After 25 years, Dallas finally has matched courage
with cash and will open the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository to the world.
   Over the decades, the old warehouse has survived arsonists and
calls for demolition. For a time, all buyers shunned it. All this
ill will because of a new young order clerk named Lee Harvey Oswald,
who, perched at a corner window on boxes of ``Rolling Readers,''
apparently fired two, maybe three, rifle shots at a motorcade
passing below.
   Now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside
elevator that will carry up to half-a-million visitors a year to the
infamous sixth floor, where they can view an exhibit on President
John F. Kennedy and look out that corner window down to Dealey Plaza.
   It's a $3.5 million project 12 years in the making _ one that
Dallas, for a long time, never wanted for fear of drawing more
attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city.
   ``What we are doing is facing up to our history,'' said Lindalyn
Adams, chairwoman of the Dallas County Historical Foundation, who
has made the exhibit a decade-long personal crusade.
   ``The old saying is, `Time heals all wounds,''' said Lee Jackson,
the chief of the county commissioners who made completion of the
Kennedy exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech.
   ``It's not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover
over some period of time, like Gettysburg, or the Alamo, or
Yorktown,'' Jackson said. ``It's taken Dallas 25 years to reach this
consensus.''
   Every day of the year, virtually around the clock, a steady
trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to Dealey
Plaza and the grassy knoll. They find monuments but then learn they
honor the city's founders.
   They see a 10-sentence plaque on the side of the book depository.
The nine sentences noting the spot where Dallas was settled are
followed by this:
   ``On Nov. 22, 1963, the building gained national notoriety when
Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F.
Kennedy from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade
passed the site.''
   And then they invariably count six floors up.
   Next Feb. 20, on President's Day, ``The Sixth Floor Exhibit''
will open to the public.
   More than $1 million has been raised privately, with $300,000 to
go. The fundraising effort took years, Adams said, and didn't really
pick up until Jackson made it a county priority.
   ``It's easy to misunderstand what we're doing,'' Mrs. Adams said.
``There is a feeling among many of us who were living in Dallas at
the time that we'd just as soon not be reminded.''
   To permit construction to begin, the county advanced $2.2
million, which will be repaid through the $4 admission charge.
   The exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together
with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker Martin Jurow
(``Terms of Endearment,'' ``Waltz Across Texas,'' ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's'').
   ``It's far more than an assassination museum,'' Adams said.
``It's about the life of President Kennedy, and his death. It's
about the '60s and what Dallas was like. It puts everything in the
context of American cultural history.''
   The non-profit exhibit will have few actual artifacts _ no rifle,
for example, only an original of the black-bordered anti-Kennedy ad,
headlined ``Welcome to Dallas, Mr. President,'' that appeared in The
Dallas Morning News that day, along with a reporter's notes and an
Associated Press teletype machine.
   There will be 400 photographs, many taken by the 22 people who
were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired.
   The corner window will be sealed by glass panels, although the
actual green-painted window frame was removed by a previous owner.
The spots where Oswald's rifle, three spent cartridges and palm
prints were found will be recreated, based on police photos.
   The building, like Dealey Plaza, is remarkably unchanged from
Nov. 22, 1963.
   The school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for
eight years after the assassination. A Nashville, Tenn., promoter
bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a
Kennedy Museum. Ownership reverted to the previous owner, Dallas oil
and real estate mogul D. Harold Byrd, who then could not sell the
building. Calls for its demolition were turned back because the city
refused to issue a demolition permit.
   In 1977, voters approved a bond package that included $400,000 to
purchase the warehouse and convert it _ except for the sixth floor _
into county office space.
   It is now the Dallas County Administration Building. Jackson's
second-floor office looks out on the spot where Kennedy was shot.
   ``No one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck
by the number of curious visitors,'' Jackson said. ``And everyone
who works here is aware they're located in a place of unusual public
interest.''
   Over time, Jackson said, Dallas realized the world probably would
never stop coming to Dealey Plaza.
   ``Over time, people finally felt they were able to put the
experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer
viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the
assassination,'' he said.
   ``Over time, the community has seen that the interest of the
world is permanent and enduring.''

<TEXT>
   It is a novel with an ending dictated a
quarter-century ago: A president is assassinated, his purported
killer gunned down while in police custody.
   It also is a union of fact and fiction, a work of more than 100
real and invented characters that teeters on yesterday's headlines
with its tale of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the
labyrinthine network of spies and mercenaries of
civil servants, the brutal underworld of the mob and the lives and
times of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.
   In ``Libra,'' author Don DeLillo sets up the theory that
Kennedy's assassination was part of a CIA scheme to rejuvenate, the corruption
the
anti-Castro movement in the United States following the Bay of Pigs
debacle. He futher hypothesizes that Ruby killed Oswald as part of a
conspiracy with the Mafia to pay off a nightclub debt.
   He uses literary roads once traveled by such technicians of the
``nonfiction novel'' as the late Truman Capote in ``In Cold Blood''
and Norman Mailer in ``Armies of the Night.'' Oswald and others are
not presented to us as mere cardboard shadows of news reports;
DeLillo sks have been written about
Kennedy and his family, according to the John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston. The assassination feeds a public hungry for any nugget that
can explain what to many is still a hideous riddle.
   ``Lincoln's death was tragic, but we remember what he did as
president. Kennedy didn't do as much as Lincoln; he didn't have
time,'' Kennedy chronicler, friend and historian William Manchester
has said. ``Jack's death was a tragedy and his life was a triumph. I
think we should remember more than the tragedy. We should remember
the triumph.''
   The Kennedy slaying seems to haunt DeLillo's earlier works, such
as ``Running Dog'' and ``Players.'' His ``Americana'' ends in Dallas
at Dealey Plaza.
   However, ``Libra,'' which was Oswald's astrological sign, is no
mere assassination theory book: Its tapestry is richer, with threads
of human frailities, fears and desires woven into it. It is an
intricate design of twists and turns and surprises.

   ``Lee turned up the handle, drew the bolt back.
   ``The President reacted, arms coming up, elbows high and wide.
   ``There were pigeons, suddenly everywhere, cracking down from the
eaves and beating west.
   ``The report sounded over the plaza, flat and clear.
   ``The President's fists were clenched near his throat, arms bowed
out.
   ``Lee drove the bolt forward, jerking the handle down.
   ``The Lincoln was moving slower now. It was almost dead still. It
was sitting naked in the street 80 yards from the underpass.
   ``Ready on the firing line.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In a 1983 Rolling Stone article, DeLillo called the Kennedy
assassination ``a story about our uncertain grip on the world.''
   It was a tale, he said, ``exploded into life by a homeless man
who himself could not grip things tightly and hold them fast, whose
soul-scarred loneliness and rage led him to invent an American
moment that echoes down the decades.''
   After writing the article for Rolling Stone, he spent three years
researching and writing ``Libra.'' He shoveled his way through the
Government Printing Office's 26 volumes of the Warren Commission
Report, which concluded that Oswald was the sole assassin. He also
visited places in Dallas and New Orleans where Oswald had lived.
   DeLillo has an afterword in ``Libra,'' a disclaimer of sorts:
``This is a work of imagination. While drawing from the historical
record, I've made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any
question raised by the assassination.''

   ``Where were you, and what was your reaction when
you heard that President John F. Kennedy had been shot?''
   John Jovich, who was 8 years old when he overheard the school
principal whisper news of the shooting to his teacher, recently put
that question to 250 celebrities and assembled their responses into
a book, ``Reflections on JFK's Assassination,'' published by
Woodbine House.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, recalled being near the Senate
chambers and realizing that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the
presiding officer. ``I immediately dispatched a page to tell Senator
Kennedy to leave the rostrum for a matter of utmost emergency. It
was then that Senator Kennedy learned of his brother's shooting.''
   Singer Billy Joel said he first tried to console an eighth-grade
classmate who was crying. He later took a long walk, feeling ``a
deep bitterness and a despair I had never before experienced in my
life.''
   Rona Barrett, the Hollywood columnist, remembers being ``at a
famous Palm Springs racquet club. People came running out of the
clubhouse screaming that someone had shot Jack Kennedy.''
   Roy Rogers said the assassination ``proved to me that we have a
lot more subversive activists in our country than we realize.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter said he had walked into his
warehouse to weigh a load of grain when a group of farmers told him
of the shooting. He said he prayed, and ``wept openly for the first
time in 10 years _ for the first time since the day my own father
died.''
   Novelist Isaac Asimov said all he could think about was ``that I
didn't want Johnson. But I got him.''
   Burt Bacharach said he was working on a song with Hal David when
he found out about the shooting. He said he left the building and
went to a bar, where he eventually got ``into a fight with some
people who were having a good time laughing, etc., totally
disrespectful of the moment.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It came as no surprise to anyone in Latin
America that a novelist, poet and essayist, Mario Vargas Llosa,
would seek to become president of Peru.
   For Vargas Llosa, frequently mentioned as a future winner of the
Nobel Prize for Literature, is following a centuries-old tradition
of an area where cultural figures, both classical and pop, have also
played important political roles.
   Peru's Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez, himself a writer and
educator as well as politician, says that in Latin America
individuals who have distinguished themselves in literature and art
can carry their prestige into politics because they live in ``half
finished'' societies that value men of multiple talents.
   ``In societies that have not evolved greatly, there is little
specialization,'' Sanchez, who is 88 and has written more than 100
books, said in an interview.
   ``The politician can be a writer, a priest, a military man, many
things.''
   Vargas Llosa, who once described himself as a ``specialist in
fanatasies, in dreams,'' stands in sharp contrast to the
professional politicians and technocrats in many other parts of the
world.
   ``This is definitely not my calling,'' the 52-year-old writer
said recently. ``If my country were not what it is, politics would
probably be a very secondary concern in my life.''
   Instead, the author of such books as ``The Green House'' and
``Conversation in a Cathedral'' finds himself leading a center-right
political movement that seeks to prevent the election in 1990 of
Alfonso Barrantes, a declared Communist now favored to win the
presidency.
   ``I am fundamentally a writer, but at the same time I am a person
concerned about the reality of his country and, above all, its
future,'' said Vargas Llosa.
   Peru is wracked by its worst economic crisis of the century, with
the annual inflation rate surpassing 1,200 percent. It also is
bloodied by a savage leftist insurgency that has claimed more than
12,000 lives.
   Vargas Llosa has been traveling into Peru's remote backlands,
climbing down mine shafts high in the Andes and visiting isolated
Indian villages in the Amazon forests to spread his message of the
dangers that await Peru if the next presidential election is won by
Communists.
   ``They would impoverish us even more than we are now and little
by little, just as has occurred with other Marxist regimes, they
would totally trample our political freedoms,'' he declared at a
recent rally.
   Elsewhere, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Latin America's most popular
ballard singer, speaks seriously of running for president of
Venezuela. Ruben Blades, one of the region's top singers and
composers of salsa music, talks of one day seeking the presidency of
Panama.
   Although writers and artists participate actively in politics
throughout the region, only a few have been successful in their bids
for the presidency of a country.
   Romulo Gallegos, Venezuela's greatest novelist, was elected
president in 1947. Juan Bosch, regarded as the Dominican Republic's
finest short story writer, was elected president of that Caribbean
country in 1962.
   Both men were overthrown after only months in office by their
countries' armed forces, which viewed them as arrogant and soft on
leftists.
   ``Gallegos had a lot of Communists around him and they began to
flatter him _ and that is a writer's great weakness, his vanity. We
are all vain,'' said Sanchez, a founder of Peru's populist Aprista
Party.
   Bosch's ouster led to a 1965 popular rebellion that ended after
U.S. troops invaded the Dominican Republic. At 79 Bosch is still
active in politics. He received 18 percent of the vote in 1986, but
polls indicate that if the elections were held today, he would win
against conservative President Joaquin Balaguer, a lawyer and also a
writer.
   In Brazil, where the national language is Portuguese, President
Jose Sarney has written collections of poetry and short stories,
some of which have been translated into English, Spanish, French and
Russian.
   Sarney has called his election to the prestigious Brazilian
Academy of Letters ``the greatest moment of pure happiness in my
life.''
   The list of distinguished Latin American writers and artists who
have sought public office or influenced public policy through their
political activism is long.
   Chile's most famed literary figure, the poet Pablo Neruda, winner
of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971, was the Chilean Communist
Party's candidate for president in 1970. But he withdrew to give his
support to a coalition candidate, Salvador Allende, a Marxist who
went on to win and was overthrown in a military coup three years
later.
   The region's best known writer, Colombia's Nobel Prize winner
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, is a vigorous defender of Fidel Castro's
Cuba.
   In Mexico the late world-renowned muralists David Alfaro
Siqueiros and Diego Rivera were leading members of the Mexican
Communist Party.
   Mexico's poet and essayist Octavio Paz and novelist Carlos
Fuentes have both won the Miguel de Cervantes prize, the most
important literary honor for Spanish-language writers, and are
perennial candidates for the Nobel Prize. Both have served in the
Mexican diplomatic service and have been outspoken in their
political views.
   Fuentes, currently a professor of literature at Harvard
University, has been a strong critic of U.S. policy in Central
America.
   Octavio Paz, going against the current of leftist sympathy among
Latin American intellectuals, says he has little use for Marxism.
Mexico's leftist intellectuals say they have little use for Paz.
   Although he never served in public office, Argentina's most
distinguished writer, Jorge Luis Borges, was known not for what he
did in the political arena but what he wrote and said about it. He
frequently expressed his scorn for elected governments in Argentina
and other Latin American nations.
   ``You Americans are worthy of democracy, but we are not,'' Borges
said in an interview before his death last year. ``In this country
we always find some rascal to vote for.''
   Nicaragua's leading poet is the Rev. Ernesto Cardenal, a Roman
Catholic priest who served for years as culture minister in the
leftist Sandinista government. An immediately recognizable figure
for his black beret, Cardenal has been criticized for using his
international prestige to defend the regime.
   But Vice President Sergio Ramirez of Nicaragua, who just
published his third novel, is considered the most influential
intellectual within the Sandinista government.
   The Venezuelan writer Carlos Rangel has sharply criticized the
role of intellectuals in Latin American public life in a
controversial book, ``From the Good Savage to the Good
Revolutionary.''
   ``The quality of work of these writers or their academic
distinction is often mediocre,'' he wrote. ``Many of them have
achieved prominence because they were born into undemanding
societies.''
   Rangel excepted from his criticism a handful of distiguished
writers, among them Vargas Llosa.
   Vargas Llosa has unleashed his own criticism of intellectuals in
politics, whom he accuses of irresponsibly urging violent revolution
in Peru.
   ``Many young men are killing and dying because of what they have
been taught by intellectuals, many of whom today are at American
universities, living off the imperialism they condemned,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Mexico's foremost living writers, Octavio Paz
and Carlos Fuentes, are among the sharpest critics of Mexico's
system of government, under which the same party been in power for
six decades.
   Paz charges the long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which emerged from the 1910-20 revolution, has become corrupt.
Fuentes maintains the revolution itself was betrayed and corrupted
even before it was over.
   Both writers were born in Mexico City and are recipients of the
prestigious Miguel Cervantes prize, the foremost literary award for
Spanish writers. Both lived abroad for many years and served as
Mexican diplomats, and both resigned for the same reason _ the
bloody suppression of student riots in Mexico City in 1968.
   Although they no longer have any direct influence on government,
their works and statements provoke thought and sometimes acrimonious
debate among their countrymen.
   Paz, once an admirer of Marxism, now calls himself a
``European-style social democrat'' and says he has little use for
Marxist ideology.
   Fuentes has been called a ``liberal'' but so far has not
committed himself to any ideology; he has been criticized by Paz's
fans on grounds that he has spent so much time abroad that he
doesn't know Mexico anymore.
   Even so, his influence was demonstrated after the U.S.
presidential election when his long analysis of the American outcome
was published on the front page of one of Mexico's leading
newspapers, Excelsior.
   Fuentes credited George Bush's aide, James Baker, with running a
brilliant, cynical and pragmatic campaign and said Baker's
appointment as Secretary of State was a good sign for U.S.-Mexico
relations because of what he called Baker's pragmatic turn of mind.
   Paz's most influential work, the 1950 book-length essay ``The
Labyrinth of Solitude,'' attacks the notion that the Mexican has
developed a philosophy of his own. Instead, he says the Mexican has
isolated himself from the world and should seek to break that
pathological solitude.
   ``The whole history of Mexico ... can be regarded as a search for
our own selves, which have been deformed by alien institutions, and
a form that will express them,'' Paz says.
   In Fuentes' best known novel, ``The Death of Artemio Cruz,'' the
reader listens in on the thoughts of the dying hero who reflects on
the 12 most important days of his life and the events that brought
on the corruption of the revolution's ideals.
   Paz was born March 31, 1914, and lived in exile in the United
States for a time as a teen-ager because of his father's
revolutionary activities.
   While still a law student, he became a protege of the Chilean
Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda, who helped him publish his
first book of poems, inspired him with Marxist ideals and sent him
to Spain at the height of that country's 1936-39 civil war.
   Paz joined Spain's leftist Republican forces, insisted on being
sent to the front but was not considered ``reliable'' enough to be
given a rifle.
   Within a few years he became disillusioned with Marxism and had a
falling out with Neruda, then the Chilean ambassador.
   Paz joined the Mexican foreign service but quit in 1968 when he
was ambassador to India to protest the suppression of the student
riots. He turned against the Institutional Revolutionary Party, in
power for the past 59 years, which he has often called ``corrupt.''
   He also raised hackles by equating Cuba's Fidel Castro with
Chile's rightist dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, claiming that both
are equally repressive.
   Four years ago he caused a furor by calling Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista revolution _ which Mexico supports _ inconsequential.
   The son of a career diplomat, Fuentes was born on Nov. 11, 1928,
has lived most of his life abroad and is fluent in English. He is
currently a professor of literature at Harvard University.
   Fuentes, too, joined the diplomatic service, but resigned in 1977
while he was ambassador to France because Gustavo Diaz Ordaz was
named ambassador to Spain. Diaz Ordaz had been president in 1968,
and Fuentes said he did not want to be in the same service with the
man who ordered the Mexico City massacre that left at least 36 dead.
   Fuentes' novels include ``Hydra Head,'' ``Where the Air is
Clear,'' and ``Old Gringo,'' the fictionalized story of American
writer and journalist Ambrose Bierce, who disappeared in Mexico
during the revolution.
   Literary critics and historian Enrique Krauze, Paz's friend and
colleague, have accused Fuentes of losing touch with Mexico.
   In an article he wrote for The New Republic last June bitingly
entitled ``The Guerrilla Dandy,'' Krauze asked of Fuentes, ``Is he a
willing exile from Mexico in the United States, or a reluctant exile
from the United States in Mexico?''
   ``His work simplifies the country; his view is frivolous,
unrealistic and, all too often, false,'' Krauze added.
   ``I visit Mexico regularly,'' said Fuentes in reply. ``I go to
places where no one goes. I talk with the common people more than
with the intellectuals.''

   The dollar has bounced back after a weeklong
slide, supported by the Japanese and U.S. central banks and calming
statements from American officials.
   Monday's rebound took momentum away from traders who are bearish
toward the dollar heading into the next big test for the currency,
Wednesday's report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
September.
   Last week's slide stemmed from fears that President-elect George

more competitive abroad and shrink the trade deficit.

<HEAD>Caught in the Middle: The Sandwich Generation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caught in a vise between the financial needs of
children and the care of elderly parents, a generation of Americans
is confronted with planning problems that almost defy solution.
   They are the ``sandwich generation,'' age 45 to 55 years, with
college-age children and parents whose incomes are limited.
   Unlike the very poor, the minorities, the elderly and
disadvantaged, this group has little political clout. Its existence
barely recognized, it is nevertheless destined to grow because of
biological and sociological factors.
   Among those factors: Parents are living longer, but their
income-producing years generally are not being extended. And young
marrieds are waiting until the last tick of the biological clock
before having children.
   As a consequence, the sandwich generation's parents become aged
and more dependent just as the offspring are preparing for or
entering college. Rising tuitions add to the pressure.
   To deal with the phenomenon, financial planners are seeking
creative investment techniques for the sandwich generation, but in
almost every instance those techniques require many years to become
effective.
   Moreover, the old and once-trusted method of shifting assets to a
controlled trust and automatically getting them back after the
demise of the parents does not work any more, thanks to the 1986 Tax
Reform Act.
   In addition, the tax laws make inefficient the simple, direct
technique of providing support from the checkbook, because such
funding involves after-tax dollars, effectively reducing the benefit
to 72 cents on the dollar.
   The tax law does leave two exceptions, but many members of the
sandwich generation may find them inapplicable to them. The
exceptions are:
   _If you provide more than one-half of a parent's support, and the
parent earns less than $1,900 a year, you may claim the $1,000
dependency exemption on your tax return.
   _You may claim your parents' medical expenses along with your own
as long as you provide one-half of your parents' support. And in
this case, the $1,000 gross income test need not be met.
   Judy Walsh, an accounting partner in the San Antonio office of
Deloitte Haskins & Sells, believes a member of the sandwich
generation should find a way to transfer assets to parents so that
the parents instead are taxed.
   Walsh, who made a special study of the situation, notes that if
you transferred titled property to your parents, particularly
property with an income, you can effectively move income to their
lower tax bracket.
   One approach along this line would be to set up a trust, put
assets in the trust and instruct the trustee to use all income for
the parents. This income then becomes taxed to the parents.
   While you lose total control of the funds, the trust could be so
arranged that the assets are distributed as provided in the parents'
wills, which means the money could very well revert to you.
   Ms. Walsh suggests that a second plan would be to create the
trust to pay income to the parents for life, with the assets to go
to the sandwich generation's children upon the parents' death.
   This plan might combine support of aging parents at a minimum
after-tax cost and provide gifts to children for education. Still,
there is no assurance that the money would be available in time to
help pay tuition.
   Another strategy is to have aging parents sell their home and use
the funds for support. They would then live in a residence, perhaps
a condominium, purchased by their children, who could tap their own
home for an equity loan.
   If all works as intended, these might be among the results:
   _The aging parents could shelter up to $125,000 of the gain from
the sale of their home.
   _They would have money to live on.
   _They could pay their children rent.
   _The sandwich generation members might have tax deductions from
their equity loan.
   _The sandwich generation members might be able to deduct rental
property losses.
   _They also would have an investment that, if it were properly
selected, might earn an excellent return.
   None of the solutions is without risk, especially in view of
Congress' inclination to change tax laws. But for those in a very
difficult financial squeeze, they at least offer hope that the pain
will be reduced.

<HEAD>Interest Rates on Short-Term Securities Hit Highest Level in Three
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest
level in more than three years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.82 percent on Monday, up from 7.54
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.87 percent, up from 7.71 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.87
percent on April 29, 1985 and six-month bills averaged 7.90 on May
13, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.09 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,802.30 and and 8.31 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,602.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.35
percent last week after averaging 8.10 percent the week before.

   Private exporters have sold an additional
300,000 metric tons of American corn to the Soviet Union for
delivery in the marketing year that began Sept. 1, the Agriculture
Department has reported.
   The sale brings the total of American corn sold to the Soviets

said Monday.
   The statement did not provide further details, but last week's
price of $134.50 a metric ton for grain delivered at Rotterdam would
make the sale worth about $40.3 million. A metric ton is equivalent
to 2,200 pounds.
   The Soviet Union has been buying U.S. grain in substantial
quantities despite the expiration on Sept. 30 of a five-year grain
agreement between the two countries.
   Negotiations aimed at reaching a new agreement have been going on
periodically for a year, although there have been no formal talks
since Oct. 14, when the United States rejected a Soviet proposal of
a one-year agreement.

12.5 percent increase. Sales had fallen 10.8 percent in September

   A new computerized hotel reservations system
being developed by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and nine hotel chains
could allow travelers to book rooms like they book airline tickets.
   The new system, called UltraSwitch, will provide a central
electronic source of hotel room information for the participating
hotels and for travel agents, officials of the venture told a news
conference Monday.
   Currently, only a small fraction of hotel rooms are booked
electronically, using the computer systems provided by major
airlines to travel agents. Most hotel bookings are made through
toll-free ``800'' numbers or directly with hotels, methods which are
more expensive for the hotels to process.
   Under UltraSwitch, the number of electronic hotel bookings made
by travel agents will increase, the officials said. The system also
will provide a central pool of information on rooms available at the
participating hotels.
   By using new computer software, UltraSwitch will link the five
existing airline reservations systems in the United States with
those used by participating hotels.
   If a hotel is full, for example, it will be able to tell travel
agents what rooms are available at other participating hotels in the
same city. This is the practice followed by the airlines, which
often will book a passenger on another carrier's flight if one of
their own flights is full.
   UltraSwitch, which is expected to serve hotels in the United
States and abroad, is scheduled to be operating before the end of
next year.
   ``The consumer will now have the best opportunity to get what he
wants,'' said Robert D. McGrail, senior vice president of marketing
for Days Inns of America.
   McGrail also is chairman of The Hotel Industry Switch Co., or
THISCO, formed by the nine participating hotel chains and Murdoch
Electronic Publishing, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News America
Publishing Inc.
   The participating chains are Best Western, Days Inns, Hyatt
Hotels, La Quinta Inns, Marriott Corp., Quality Inns, Ramada Inns,
Sheraton Hotels and Trusthouse Forte Hotels. They each will have one
share in THISCO. Murdoch Electronic Publishing, which is putting up
$8 million to $9 million to finance the project, will own a special
class of stock in THISCO.
   McGrail said the group also hoped to attract as shareholders
other hotel chains, and possibly airlines and other companies. The
nine participating hotel chains represent about half of the major
hotel chains in the United States.
   ``We'll see a marriage here eventually between'' airline and
hotel reservations systems and travel agents, said Murdoch, who flew
in from London for the news conference.
   Murdoch said he got involved because some of the magazines he
publishes are ``entirely dependent'' on advertising by hotels and
airlines. The publications include Hotel and Travel Index, Travel
Weekly, Official Hotel and Resort Guide, Meetings and Conventions
Magazine, Official Meetings and Facilities Guide, and European
Travel and Life Magazine.
   The software for UltraSwitch will be developed mainly by Anasazi
Corp. of Phoenix, which has developed programs for the hotel and
financial services industries.

<HEAD>Insurance Officials React To Allstate's Plans To Pull Out</HEAD>

   Massachusetts insurance officials reacted with
surprise to Allstate Insurance Co.'s decision to become the third
major insurer in two yeras to stop writing new auto insurance
policies in the state.
   ``We had no advance knowledge,'' Peter Rice, deputy Massachusetts
insurance commissioner, said Monday. ``I guess our overall
assessment is we think the company was premature in assessing the
effect of the recently passed auto reform bill on the market.''
   Allstate officials say frustration and the state's regulatory
climate prompted the company's decision, which comes amid a wave of
anger by insurers nationwide over changing regulatory climates.
   Allstate has lost $115 million in Massachusetts over the past
five years, largely as a result of the ``unique regulatory
environment'' for auto insurance, said Kevin Sullivan, director of
Allstate's Group Auto division.
   Sullivan made his comments during a news conference to announce
Allstate's decision not to renew its license when it expires June 30.
   ``We have no intention to return,'' Sullivan said.
   The announcement came about a week after a number of insurers
doing business in California promised to leave that market _ the
nation's biggest _ after voters approved a measure providing deep
cuts in auto and other insurance rates.
   Allstate will continue selling new policies and follow through on
all its Massachusetts policies until they expire, Sullivan said.
   Last week, a bill was signed into law that will reduce 1989
insurance premiums in Massachusetts by 16 percent, or $400 million,
by cracking down on fraud and abuse in the system, reducing required
coverages and limiting the number of auto cases that end up in
court. The legislation came after industry court challenges and rate
decisions increased rates by nearly one third since 1986 to among
the highest in the country.
   Allstate saw some encouraging improvements for consumers in the
bill. But Sullivan said it did little or nothing to restore free
markets to Massachusetts.
   Massachusetts state law requires all companies wishing to sell
any form of insurance in the state to participate in an open
``high-risk'' auto insurance pool.
   State law also forbids open competition for automobile insurance.
Instead, the state insurance commissioner annually calculates a
single statewide rate for each category of compulsory and optional
insurance. Only Texas has a similar system.
   Allstate, based in Northbrook, Ill., has been doing business in
Massachusetts since 1951. The company has 6.6 percent of the
Massachusetts auto insurance market and 5.2 percent of the state's
homeowners insurance market.
   Massachusetts accounts for some $199 million of Allstate's
premiums annually, or about 2 percent of the company's business in
the United States.
   Allstate has 573 full- and part-time employees at several
locations in Massachusetts. Sullivan said Allstate will ``make every
effort to try to relocate qualified employees'' and predicted there
would be few or no layoffs.
   In California, voters last week approved Proposition 103, which
mandates that property and casualty insurers roll their rates back
to a level 20 percent below those in effect on Nov. 8, 1987. In a
addition, drivers with good records would get an additional 20
percent off.
   The California Supreme Court has delayed the start of the law
while it considers its constitutionality. Sullivan said Allstate was
confident the insurers would prevail in court.
   He also said Allstate had no intention to pull out of California,
which he described as quite different from Massachusetts in that it
allows ``open competition.''
   More than 100 companies sell auto insurance in Massachusetts, but
90 percent of the coverage is written by the top 25 insurers.
Allstate ranked fourth in statewide market share.
   Allstate's departure was preceded in the past two years by Kemper
Group, Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. and two smaller companies. All
cited millions of dollars in losses in the Massachusetts auto market
for their decisions.
   To continue writing other forms of insurance in the state, Kemper
Group recently won state regulatory and legislative approval to set
up a spinoff company to assume its auto insurance business.
   Fireman's Fund, meanwhile, agreed to pay a $45 million settlement
to the state as compensation to the high-risk drivers' pool so it
could abandon the Massachusetts market. Since reaching that
settlement last year, the company has proposed buying a subsidiary
firm with Massachusetts licenses so Fireman's Fund could re-enter
the state and sell other forms of insurance.

Planning</HEAD>

   Japanese companies are poised to erode the
United States' lead in the biotechnology race, partly by introducing
biotech lipstick, wine, detergent and other products that help build
grassroots support for the field, according to a panel of industry
experts.
   ``The Japanese are more unique and more innovative in the use of
biotech,'' said Akihiro Yoshikawa, a biotechnology research director
at the University of California at Berkeley. He also predicted Japan
would be the world biotechnology leader by the year 2000.
   Yoshikawa made his remarks at a news conference Monday marking
the opening of Biotech USA, a three-day industry conference and
exhibition. Participants called on American business, government and
research leaders to forge a long-term strategy _ including
government assistance _ to help the United States maintain its
competitive place in the international biotechnology market.
   Industry watchers fear history will repeat itself and the United
States will lose its lead in biotechnology as it lost the lead in
electronics and computer chip manufacturing.
   ``We have a tremendous lead, we discovered it and it's sort of
been our baby,'' said Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.
   ``We still have time to do something if we can get our act
together,'' said Chiles, who sponsored legislation this year to
consolidate the government's role in biotechnology. ``We can do a
hell of a lot better job than we've done in some other areas. In
fact, we've got to. Other countries are not sitting still.''
   Chiles' legislation failed, but its key elements have been
implemented, he said.
   Yoshikawa joked that ``you don't want to try Japanese biotech
wine,'' but nevertheless praised Japanese companies for introducing
household products created through biotechnology.
   ``People are not afraid of trying something new,'' he said.
``That may be a key factor for Japanese success in biotechnology.''
   The wine is made with a tissue culture of the slow-growing
ginseng root that is produced in a test tube, and purple-colored
biotech lipstick is made with a tissue culture pigment rather than a
costly plant-based coloring agent, he said.
   ``Biotech companies cannot survive...without some systematic
government protections,'' Yoshikawa said, mentioning funding,
product protections and other support mechanisms.
   Japan is the leading threat to America's edge, according to
panelists who said Japanese product approval regulations and patent
laws can slow the introduction of American products in Japan.
   George Rathmann, president of AmGen, a biotech firm based in
Thousand Oaks, Calif., said government support could include
speeding up the U.S. patent process and possibly subsidizing
research.

<HEAD>Another Look: Chubb Moves to Heal Black Eye Over Drought Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chubb Corp. faced a major image problem from
a minor part of its insurance business, but the company's handling
of controversy over its drought insurance should keep its name
relatively unclouded, analysts say.
   ``They really exhibited the type of concern about the quality of
their business and their reputation,'' said Carol Manning, an
analyst at Smith Barney in New York.
   Chubb took a major step toward putting the controversy behind it
last week when it announced a $48 million settlement to a
class-action suit representing 8,000 farmers in 10 midwestern
states. Farmers had sued when applications for insurance over this
summer's drought were denied.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin in Cincinnati still must approve
the settlement.
   Chubb, based in Warren, was prepared to offer $40 million in
insurance for below average rainfall. But brokers sold more than
$300 million in coverage, enraging the farmers who were denied
coverage and prompting at least seven state insurance departments to
launch proceedings against the company.
   Chubb took steps to repair the damage, including granting $11
million in goodwill payments, setting up a crisis center to answer
questions and taking out newspaper advertisements, all in advance of
last week's settlement.
   ``I think they as a company want to get this behind them'' and
``out of the press,'' said Jamie Guenther, an analyst at Duff &
Phelps Inc. of Chicago.
   ``They are a company with a sizable ego to match what is over
time a pretty darn good company,'' Guenther said. ``They have
nurtured their reputation.''
   Chubb ``bent over backwards to appease all parties involved,''
said Michael Lewis, of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   Weather insurance constitutes less than 1 percent of Chubb's
business. Its main lines are commercial property and casualty
insurance, and it also specializes in products such as corporate
officer liability insurance and upper-income homeowners' insurance,
said Guenther.
   Financially, costs associated with the insurance and controversy
could cost investors about 76 cents a share for 1988, Chubb has
estimated. Jeffrey Cohen, of Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York,
expects 1988 earnings to be $8 a share, excluding one-time tax
benefits.
   Chubb earned $345 million, or $8.29 a share in 1987. It is the
nation's 16th largest property and casualty insurer, with assets of
$9.4 billion as of Sept. 30.
   Analysts said the drought insurance program was unusual partly
because Chubb had an outside managing general agent, Good Weather
International, design and handle the policy. That was a rarity for
Chubb, and unlikely to happen again, said Lewis.
   The company has said Good Weather exceeded its authority in
offering more than $40 million in insurance.
   ``I think they'll be more careful with how they (deal) with
managing general agents,'' said Ms. Manning said.
   Eventually, Lewis said, ``Wall Street will forget about (the
controversy) and concentrate on 1989 numbers.''
   Chubb is not contemplating offering a similar type of drought
insurance next year, said company spokeswoman Gail Devlin. She said
it was not appropriate to discuss plans beyond that.

<HEAD>Dollar Inches Up Against Yen As Share Prices Hit Another Record
High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today while prices soared to a record high on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange for the third day in a row.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's
main index, rose 308.51 points, or 1.07 percent, to close at
28,829.41, its all-time high.
   The dollar opened at 123.60 yen and moved in a range of
123.15-123.72 yen. It closed at 123.25 yen, up 0.25 yen from
Monday's finish.
   Dealers said the dollar opened bearish, but continuous
intervention by the Bank of Japan prevented the U.S. currency from
falling.
   ``It appeared difficult to push the dollar below the 123.30 yen
level because of the intevention by the Bank of Japan,'' said a
dealer at a U.S. commercial bank in Tokyo.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference today
there would be cooperative intervention with other major monetary
nations in the currency market if the dollar again drops markedly.
   Another dealer with a major commercial bank said market players
were looking forward to the release of U.S. monthly trade figures
for September, scheduled for Wednesday.
   In the stock market, securities dealers said gains in
large-capital companies such as steel and heavy industry ignited the
rally across the board.
   ``Share prices are rising in an almost ideal pattern,'' said a
securities dealer at a major Japanese brokerage, who demanded
anonymity. ``Steel shares are leading the market, and when they are
resting, other shares such as financials, are taking over.''
   The previous record high for the Nikkei was Monday's close of
28,520.90, followed by Friday's finish of 28,489.57.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 3rd graf pvs, Panetta said, to CORRECT ``irregardless''

<TEXT>
   The incoming chairman of the House Budget
Committee says tax increases will be needed next year to make
legally required cuts in the federal deficit, despite
President-elect George Bush's anti-tax stance.
   ``Anybody who's dealt with budget issues knows the size of the
challenge is too large to exempt any areas,'' Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said in an interview. ``Once you say this area won't be
considered, you paint yourself into a corner.''
   Panetta said new revenues will have to be part of any package for
the required reduction of red ink by tens of billions of dollars,
regardless of Bush's oft-repeated campaign pledge ``no new taxes.''
   Under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, the deficit for the
1990 fiscal year _ which begins Oct. 1 _ is not to exceed $100
billion.
   Last week, just two days after Bush was elected, the Reagan
administration's Office of Management and Budget raised its 1990
deficit estimate to $132 billion. Panetta said he believes the
shortfall will be even higher _ closer to $140 billion or $150
billion.
   If the deficit target is exceeded, the law requires automatic
spending cuts to pare the red ink to $100 billion.
   Panetta said Bush's well-known ``read my lips'' promise to oppose
tax increases ``create a potential for confrontation'' between
Democrats and Republicans.
   ``Republicans will feel a commitment was made that can't be
breached in any way, and Democrats will say why should we vote for a
tax increase if he has made that commitment,'' Panetta said.
   Panetta, who takes over the budget panel when lawmakers return in
January, said he believes Bush's willingness to compromise will be
apparent when he submits his first budget to Congress, perhaps in
February or March. President Reagan will present his final budget to
Congress on Jan. 9, but lame duck presidents' final budgets can be
rewritten by their successors.
   ``If Reagan submits his budget proposal and if it reflects the
same Reagan priorities that he's submitted time and time again, that
have been declared dead on arrival, and if Bush replays those same
priorities, that will be a signal that we're in for more
confrontation on the budget issue,'' Panetta said.
   Panetta said he hopes Bush will begin seeking congressional input
early on so his spending plan reflects agreements with Capitol Hill
on taxes.
   ``If not, I suspect we'll be fighting tooth and nail to see what
can be done,'' he said.
   On the campaign trail, Bush proposed a ``flexible freeze'' plan
for balancing the budget. Under the proposal, overall government
spending would be allowed to keep up with inflation, with cuts in
some programs and increases for others. He never provided any
specifics, however.
   Panetta said that with Bush insisting he will not slash large
chunks of the budget _ such as defense and Social Security _ there
simply will not be enough vulnerable programs left to yield sizable
savings from spending cuts.
   ``I've looked at that thing in a dozen different ways and don't
see how it works,'' Panetta said of the flexible freeze plan.
   Panetta said he believes Bush has not yet made it politically
impossible for himself to agree to tax increases. He said that just
as Reagan agreed to several tax increases despite his anti-tax
rhetoric, Bush could shift his position.
   ``The president will have to say to the American people that
we're facing a major crisis in dealing with the deficit, and the
only way to meet the challenge is to sit down and work out a package
with Congress,'' Panetta said.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., is stepping down after four
years as budget committee chairman. Under House rules, a lawmaker
can only head the budget panel for four years.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Blocks West Point-Pepperell's Defense Against Farley
Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officers of West Point-Pepperell Inc., denied the
use of their ``poison pill'' takeover defense, will have to come up
with another way to battle a $1.4 billion buyout bid from Farley Inc.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell granted a temporary
injunction Monday blocking the Georgia-based textile maker from
using the pill against Farley's $48-a-share takeover attempt. The
judge also refused to grant Pepperell two preliminary injunctions it
sought against Farley.
   Pepperell spokesman Donald Downs said the company plans to appeal
Tidwell's ruling and declined further comment.
   Pepperell now must fight more aggressively to overcome the bid,
said Deborah Bronston, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   The ruling ``weakens their case, and it becomes incumbent upon
West Point Pepperell managers to come up with their own offer,'' she
said.
   That offer to stockholders could include a leveraged buyout of
the company, a restructuring that would include the sale of
Pepperell assets or a ``white knight'' that would make a friendly
counter offer for ownership of the company, Ms. Bronston said.
   The West Point-based diversified manufacturer of consumer soft
goods including Arrow shirts and Martex towels sought to protect
itself against a possible takeover by Chicago-based Farley, which
owns 2.87 million shares, or 9.8 percent, of Pepperell stock.
   Farley, a maker of clothing, including Fruit of the Loom
underwear, and precision metal products, announced its attempt to
buy Pepperell May 23.
   Farley's offer is based on 16.73 million shares being tendered,
and other conditions, and expires at midnight EST, Nov. 21.
   Pepperell stock closed Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$42 per share, down 87{ cents.
   Pepperell's board created the pill in October 1987 to protect
itself against a possible hostile takeover. The pill allowed
stockholders not involved in a takeover attempt to purchase
additional shares, which would sharply increase the cost of a buyout.
   In response to suits by both corporations against each other and
other defendants over the plan, Tidwell voided the rights agreement.
   ``The court finds no authority in either the state law or West
Point's Articles of Incorporation which authorize the rights plan,''
Tidwell wrote. He said the plan discriminated among shareholders
because some were given rights not allowed others in a takeover
attempt.
   William F. Farley, chairman of the company seeking to take over
Pepperell, said, ``We are pleased by the court's ruling and believe
that it will facilitate the successful completion of our offer.''
   ``In light of the court's decision, we believe that the West
Point board should recommend the acceptance of our offer, which is a
full and fair one.''
   Pepperell had countersued Farley and asked for preliminary
injunctions against the takeover on two grounds: that the company
violated a ``standstill agreement'' executed when Pepperell acquired
textile maker J.P. Stevens & Co. Inc. in March and that Farley's
proposed financing package violated federal margin regulations.
   Another defendant in Pepperell's suit was Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., a New York-based financial services corporation which was
involved in the dismantling of J.P. Stevens. The standstill
agreement approved March 13 specified that none of the parties
involved would assist or encourage any attempt to acquire Stevens,
which Pepperell now owns.
   The suit claimed Drexel was providing assistance to Farley in the
takeover attempt in violation of the agreement.
   Tidwell ruled that neither Drexel nor Farley were parties to the
standstill agreement and, among other things, ``there has been no
showing that either Drexel, or derivatively, Farley, used any
confidential information obtained by Drexel'' in connection with the
buyout of Stevens in the Pepperell takeover attempt.
   Tidwell conceded ``the showing made by West Point indicates that
Farley's financing is substantially suspect and may be a violation
of the margin requirements,'' but ruled ``Farley has adequately
disclosed the potential effect of the alleged margin violations''
and denied the request for an injunction.

<HEAD>Quasar Must Pay $3.8 Million in Discrimination Case: Attorneys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury has awarded $3.8 million to three
former Quasar Co. employees, all over 50, who were fired and whose
duties were transferred to younger men, their attorneys say.
   A federal jury Monday awarded $1.9 million _ between $508,000 and
$713,000 to each man _ but the total amount was being doubled to
$3.8 million because the jury found the discrimination was willful,
the attorneys said.
   Quasar, a sales subsidiary of Japanese-owned Matsushita Electric
Corp. of Paramus, N.J., dismissed John Fortino, Carl Meyers and F.
William Schulz during a 1986 company restructuring that affected
approximately 200 workers in Franklin Park.
   Attorney Steven L. Bashwiner, who represented Quasar, declined to
comment on the verdict.
   ``There were several tip-offs that discrimination might be a part
of the picture,'' said plaintiff attorney Norman Berger. ``The
company continued to hire new people. The vast majority of them were
very young, under 40.
   ``They told our clients that their jobs were being eliminated,
but they reassigned those functions to younger people,'' he said.
   Fortino, 58, had been assistant general manager of the
advertising and sales promotion department at Quasar's Franklin Park
facility since March 1979. He was awarded $508,857, or $1.01 million
when doubled.
   Meyers, 53, was a nine-year employee and manager of sales
administration at the site. He receives $728,223, or $1.45 million
when doubled.
   Schulz, 54, had worked for Quasar and its former owner, Motorola
Inc., since 1957. When he was forced to leave, he was national
manager of physical distribution. He was awarded $713,908 or $1.42
million.
   The jury rejected a claim made by a fourth former worker, Sophie
Mustachio of Franklin Park.

   Stocks opened slightly higher this morning but
trading was light, reflecting investor reluctance to participate
ahead of the government's potentially market-moving monthly trade
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.47 points to
2,072.55 by 10 a.m. EST.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.29 to 151.33. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose 0.56 to 289.96.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
440 up, 411 down and 562 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
15 million shares after the first 30 minutes.
   Wall Street strategists said the market remains preoccupied with
the weak dollar and fear of higher interest rates, which hurt stocks
in the aftermath of Vice President George Bush's presidential
election victory a week ago.
   If the Commerce Department report on the September merchandise
trade deficit Wednesday is substantially above the expectations of a
$10.5 billion shortfall, many investment professionals expect the
market to weaken because it will likely mean the dollar will fall
again.
   ``The real focus is on the trade numbers tomorrow,'' said Peter
J. DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York. ``We won't see anything more clearly until after
those numbers come out.''
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.95 to
2,065.08, bringing its loss over the past four sessions to 62.41
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 539 up, 885 down and 510 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 142.90 million shares, against 135.50

<HEAD>Grand Met Extends $60-Per-Share Offer for Pillsbury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC today extended for the
third time its $5.23 billion offer for Pillsbury Co., saying that
79.1 percent of Pillsbury stock now has been tendered to the British
conglomerate.
   The $60-per-share takeover offer, which was to expire Monday
night, was extended until Nov. 18.
   Grand Met said that as of the Monday night deadline, nearly 67.6
million shares of Pillsbury common stock, representing approximately
79.1 percent of the outstanding shares, had been tendered and not
withdrawn.
   When it extended its second deadline of Nov. 8, Grand Met
reported that about 74.3 percent of Pillsbury outstanding shares had
been tendered.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said today the Minneapolis-based
food and restaurant company would have no comment on the latest
extension.
   On Oct. 4, Grand Met undertook one of the biggest hostile
takeover attempts on a company with its offer for Pillsbury.
   Pillsbury later announced a restructuring that included spinning
off its Burger King Corp. subsidiary as an independent company.
   Pillsbury and Grand Met also have been skirmishing in court over
the validity of Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' takeover defense, which
would make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive.
   Grand Met said Friday a Delaware judge had requested briefs by
Monday from both sides on new motions in the British firm's suit to
quash the pill.
   Meanwhile, the British company's chief of U.S. operations, Ian A.
Martin, said he was taking seriously rumors that a group of
unidentified investors were seeking buyers for all or parts of the
London-based distilling, gambling and franchise conglomerate.
   Martin said one of the potential participants might be Pillsbury.
   Part of the reason Grand Metropolitan might be considered an
attractive takeover target is the difference between its stock price
of about $8 a share and its estimated breakup value of between
$12.50 and $18 a share.
   That degree of discrepancy can invite takeover bids by investors
who hope to profit by selling pieces of a target company.

<HEAD>Lukman Calls For Higher Oil Production Ceiling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Chairman Rilwanu Lukman called for a higher
oil production ceiling for the 13-nation cartel Tuesday, and warned
that a price war would erupt if the group's members did not respect
their output quotas, a published report said Tuesday.
   Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are gathering in Vienna for their semi-annual meeting on
Nov. 21, which has taken on added importance because of a plunge in
oil price as a result of over production.
   Lukman, quoted in an interview with the daily Al-Watan newspaper,
did not specify what the new production ceiling should be. But he
excluded a rise to as many as 22 million barrels a day.
   Current OPEC output is estimated at just below that figure,
because of overproduction by some cartel members.
   OPEC's current production ceiling is 16.6 million barrels a day.
This includes a quota of 1.5 million barrels for Iraq, which
rejected this figure when it was set in Dec. 1986 and is currently
producing almost double that amount.
   Kuwait and its sister states in the Gulf Cooperation Council have
proposed that Iraq be given a quota equal to Iran's 2.3 million
barrels per day, to raise the OPEC ceiling to at least 17.4 million
barrels per day.
   The other GCC states are Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
producer, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
   Lukman stressed in the interview that adherence by member states
to the production quotas was the best way to raise the price of oil
above the OPEC benchmark of $18 per barrel.
   The current world oil glut has forced the price down to around
$13 per barrel.
   ``As the present OPEC agreement expires at the end of December,
we have to reach a new accord in Vienna, but this time we aspire to
see the agreement signed by all 13 members,'' Lukman said.
   He warned the agreement would collapse if it was violated by
anyone. He explained that ``in the past some members managed to go
on violating the agreement because other members stuck to their
quotas.
   ``But if the coming agreement is violated by any member, all
members will have to increase their production. Those violators are
well aware of this fact,'' he said.

the market remains preoccupied with the weak dollar and fear of
higher interest rates, which hurt stocks in the aftermath of Vice
President George Bush's presidential election victory a week ago.
   If the Commerce Department report on the September merchandise
trade deficit is substantially above the expectations of a $10.5
billion shortfall, many investment professionals expect the market
to weaken because it will likely mean the dollar will fall again.

<HEAD>Beazer Buying Out Deal Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British industrialist Brian Beazer announced a
refinancing plan that eliminates one of the most contentious issues
in his hostile $1.8 billion takeover of Koppers Co.
   Beazer's company, Beazer PLC, plans to acquire the interests of
its partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster
Bank PLC, in BNS Inc. BNS is the shell company formed to launch the
takeover last June.
   The partners are to be bought out by the end of February, Matthew
Thorne, Beazer's group investment director, said Monday.
   In a separate development Tuesday, Beazer announced from Bath,
England, that it has conditionally agreed to sell Koppers' Wolman
division, a leading supplier of timber treatment products and
services, to Hickson International PLC for $67.5 million in cash.
   The deal depends on approval by the Hickson shareholders and
regulatory clearance. It is part of the ongoing program for disposal
of the Koppers chemicals operations.
   Shearson Lehman's ownership of the takeover company BNS was
criticized by Koppers and the Pittsburgh-based company's allies as a
dangerous precedent in which an investment bank was in effect
helping take over a company.
   BNS would then be disbanded, and Beazer would become fully
responsible for debt incurred in the Koppers takeover.
   Shearson owns 46.1 percent of BNS, and a National Westminster
subsidiary, County NatWest Ltd., owns 4.9 percent. Beazer owns 49
percent.
   The transfers are part of a refinancing in which a consortium led
by Citibank will lend Beazer $2.3 billion.
   About $1.3 billion of that will refinance debt from the takeover
and $570 million will substitute for money Beazer planned to raise
by selling high-yield junk bonds, the British company said in a
letter to shareholders. By not issuing the bonds, Beazer expects to
save $25 million in interest expense.
   The remaining $400 million will be temporary financing to be
repaid by future sales from Koppers' chemical operations.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mostly Lower In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
disappointment about the size of corn sales to the Soviet Union and
a weakening technical picture.
   The corn market registered little excitement about the Soviet
Union's purchase of 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn. The
Agriculture Department announced the sale late Monday after the corn
market already had closed higher on rumors the Soviets had bought as
much as 2 million metric tons of corn, analysts said.
   Wheat prices were narrowly mixed this morning while soybeans were
under pressure due to weakening chart signals, which prompted one
independent trader to unload a large amount of futures contracts.
   ``The beans are acting pretty well as far I'm concened,
especially with someone pounding on them like that,'' said John
Frazier, a grain market specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in
Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.19{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.70\ a bushel; oats were \
cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $2.12{ a bushel; and
soybeans were unchanged to 3{ cents lower with November at $7.55{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .33 cent to .70 cent higher with December at
72.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .53 cent higher
with November at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower
to .35 cent higher with December at 41.02 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .33 cent to .38 cent higher with February at 45.10
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Monday while pork futures
were mostly higher.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales, bolstered by big gains at
department stores and auto dealerships, jumped 0.9 percent in
October, the biggest increase in seven months, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose $1.2 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $135.6 billion. In September, they fell by 0.3
percent after rising by a similar 0.3 percent in August.
   The October increase was the steepest since March, when sales
shot up 1.6 percent. Most economists had been expecting a milder
rise of about 0.3 percent last month.
   Retail sales are closely watched by analysts as a barometer of
overall consumer demand. Consumer spending, including services,
which are not included in the retail sales report, accounts for
about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Analysts have been divided in recent months over whether economic
growth is slowing. Sluggish retail sales in September, along with
weak job growth, led many to conclude that the Federal Reserve
Board's effort to curb growth to non-inflationary levels through
increases in interest rates was working.
   However, the early indications are that the economy rebounded in
October. In addition to the substantial gain in retail sales, the
unemployment rate dropped, matching a 14-year low.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the reports on
retail sales and industrial production _ which showed a rise of 0.4
percent in October _ ``very positive and very encouraging for
continued steady growth in the economy.''
   ``We see no evidence of rekindling inflation, inflation remains
low and under control and the economy appears to be on a very sound
and steady basis,'' he said.
   Auto sales in October jumped 1.7 percent to $29.2 billion, after
falling 2.2 percent a month earlier. It was only the second increase
since March.
   Excluding the automotive category, which is the most volatile,
sales rose 0.7 percent last month after a 0.2 percent increase in
September.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up
2.4 percent to $15.6 billion last month, following a 0.8 percent
gain in September. August sales had been depressed by
hotter-than-normal weather.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years rose 0.9 percent last month, as did non-durable
goods sales.
   Hardware, garden and building supply stores reported no change in
October after a 0.8 percent rise a month earlier.
   Furniture stores posted a modest 0.2 percent gain after falling
0.3 percent in September.
   Food and grocery stores reported a 1.1 percent gain, gasoline
stations a 1.2 percent jump, specialty clothing stores a 1.3 percent
increase, and drug stores a 0.6 percent rise.
   The only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars,
down 0.2 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in September.
   For the first 10 months of the year, sales were up 6.1 percent
over the same period of 1987, barely keeping ahead of the inflation
rate.

<HEAD>Two Japanese Auto Makers Report First-half Results</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TOKYO (AP) Honda Motor Co. reported Tuesday its earnings rose
11.4 percent in the first half ended as its sales rose nearly 10
percent.
   Because of a change in Honda's fiscal year, the comparison was
made with hypothetical six-month figures obtained by prorating
results in the transitional seven-month, year-earlier first half.
   Honda's earnings rose to 48.537 billion yen, or $392.9 million,
from an adjusted 43.572 billion yen a year earlier. That translates
to 49.06 yen, against an adjusted 43.50 yen.
   Sales totaled 1.674 trillion yen, up 9.8 percent from adjusted
sales of 1.524 trillion yen.
   Officials at Honda, a leading Japanese manufacturer of
motorcycles and four-wheel vehicles, attributed the sales gain to
favorable car sales in Japan, the United States and certain other
overseas markets.

<HEAD>Report SEC in Insider Probe of Former Penn Pals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly is probing
allegations that a group of former University of Pennsylvania
classmates who work on Wall Street have traded illegally on inside
information about corporate takeovers.
   The Washington Post, quoting what it called documents and
unidentified sources familiar with the case, said Tuesday that the
subject of SEC scrutiny was a group of about a dozen Penn graduates,
some of them former fraternity brothers, a number of whom are
professional stock speculators.
   The newspaper said the SEC's New York office began the
investigation last year after it was tipped by a confidential
informant that the group was obtaining non-public information about
takeovers from a number of investment banks. including Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. No charges have been filed.
   Lawrence Iason, the SEC's regional administrator in New York,
declined to comment on the Post story. The enforcement agency
ordinarily does not comment on pending investigations.
   The Post's account suggested that at least part of the
investigation overlapped with some of the other highly publicized
probes that have stemmed from the Ivan Boesky insider trading case
two years ago.
   Boesky, once the best-known speculator on Wall Street, turned
state's evidence after paying the SEC a record $100 million in
penalties for insider trading. He also pleaded guilty to a criminal
charge of conspiracy to lie to the SEC and is serving a three-year
prison term.
   The biggest target of Boesky's cooperation so far has been
Drexel, which is battling major civil-fraud charges by the SEC and
may face criminal indictments soon. Drexel has denied any wrongdoing.
   The Post said one of the Penn alumni allegedly under
investigation is Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader indicted a
few months ago in a criminal securities and tax fraud case involving
a small New Jersey investment firm.
   The newspaper account did not identify all the other Penn alumni
allegedly subjected to SEC scrutiny, but said four declined to
comment and one denied any wrongdoing.

   Ramada Inc. shareholders will get cash payments of
$7 per share under a restructuring that will see the sale of the
company's Ramada and Rodeway hotel businesses and its restaurant
operations.
   In a statement mailed Monday to its shareholders, Ramada provided
details of a plan it announced in October to thwart a proposed
buy-out by the company's biggest stockholder, the Pritzker family of
Chicago.
   After completing the restructuring, Ramada will be left with its
casino operations in Nevada and New Jersey, which already provide a
major share of its operating revenue.
   ``The purpose of the plan is to enable you to realize a near-term
return on your investment and provide you with a continuing stake in
Ramada's profitable gaming business,'' said Richard Snell, Ramada
board chairman, in a letter accompanying the statement to
stockholders.
   Ramada stock closed down 37{ cents a share to $8.87{ in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday.
   Jay Pritzker, president of HCC Corp., an affiliate of the
Pritzkers' Hyatt hotel chain, offered $10 a share for Ramada in
early September. Ramada rejected the $368 million offer as unfair to
shareholders.
   ``It is our firm conviction that a sale of control of the company
at this time is not in the best interests of the company, its
shareholders and other affected constituents,'' Snell said.
   Ramada operates TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort in
Atlantic City, the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Ramada
Express in Laughlin and Eddie's Fabulous '50s in Reno, Nev.
   ``We have been successful in our efforts to establish the company
as an innovative and efficient operator in the gaming industry,''
Snell told shareholders. ``Our strategy has been to provide
something more than gambling. The product we strive to offer to
customers is a complete entertainment experience in a gaming
environment.''
   Al Glasgow, a gaming analyst based in Atlantic City, said the
casinos had attracted Pritzker's attention.
   ``Mr. Pritzker wouldn't have chased Ramada a few years ago, when
it was a neophyte in the casino industry,'' Glasgow said. ``He's
chasing it today because it's matured into a pretty nice-looking
product.''
   The information statement mailed to shareholders Monday projects
operating income from the Atlantic City properties at $48.5 million
in 1989 and $74.5 million by 1991. Operating income from the Nevada
properties was projected at $29.6 million next year and $42.2
million in 1991. Net income was projected by the company at $9.4
million in 1989, $21.5 million in 1990 and $36.8 million in 1991.
   Ramada reported overall net earnings of $4.4 million during the
first nine months of 1988, including a net loss of $2.6 million for
the hotel and restaurant operations. The four gaming facilities
posted a profit of $7.6 million through September, the company said.
   Ramada owns Marie Callender's restaurants and owns, operates,
franchises or has under contract more than 800 hotels under the
Ramada and Rodeway brand names.
   But Snell said Ramada remained optimistic about the long-term
prospects for the hotel and restaurant groups.
   ``We feel confident that they will be attractive to prospective
purchasers,'' he said. ``Both have well-recognized and established
brand names and room in their markets for long-term growth.''

<HEAD>High Plains Cotton Farmers Expecting Second Big Crop in A Row</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>

   Having plowed the financial harvest of 1987
into this year's crop, cotton farmers of the Texas High Plains are
expecting to reap bountiful results again this fall.
   With the harvest in full swing, crop observers are forecasting a
total yield of about 2.7 million bales from 3 million acres for the
25-county area that stretches from Amarillo in the Panhandle of the
state, south to Midland in West Texas.
   That's slightly below last year's bumper crop of 2.7 million
bales from 2.7 million acres, which marked the second-highest
per-acre yield on record behind 1965 when slightly more than one
bale an acre was harvested.
   Texas leads all U.S. states in cotton production, and the High
Plains area alone produces more than any state except Texas.
   The 1987 crop eased financial burdens on many farmers, allowing
them to pay off loans and buy new equipment. Unlike years past,
during this growing season they had some money to spend on better
fertilizer, more irrigation and pest control.
   ``People were in a better position to invest a little more in
this crop,'' said cotton agronomist James Supak of the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service. ``We've gone through some pretty
tough ones. People are still working largely on borrowed money, but
it was a little easier to finance this crop because of the better
production last year.''
   The weather also played a big part in what should be back-to-back
crop successes. Warm and dry conditions in October improved yield
prospects by about 10 percent over earlier forecasts, say crop
observers. As a result, the cotton bolls, or seed pods, matured
before a freeze could kill the plants.
   Area growers could have been tending an even better crop had more
rainfall soaked fields during the summer.
   ``This could have been an exceptional crop, perhaps a record
crop, had we caught a rain in August,'' Supak said. ``The dryland
cotton went through a pretty severe drought stress. That will put a
cap on production.''
   Crops in most areas were spared from severe hail damage, which
all but devastated the 1986 crop, but drought conditions will cut
into the harvest in some areas of West Texas.
   Michael Gruber, an extension agent in one West Texas county,
estimated that farmers in his area would bring in only about 8,000
bales over 55,000 acres, compared with 22,000 bales last year.
   Scant rainfall and boll weevil infestation in the area, where
dryland farming predominates, doomed crops early on.
   ``We didn't have any rain through July, August or September,''
said Gruber. ``The drier it got, the worse the bugs got us, and
before we knew it we didn't have any cotton.''
   Still, state agriculture officials project that Texas' cotton
crop will be the fourth-largest in 10 years, down about 7 percent
from 1987.
   While cotton experts say the quality of this year's High Plains
cotton has been good so far, market prices have edged lower.
   ``It appears that the demand for cotton is somewhat weaker now
than it was at this time last year, especially the export demand,''
said Don Ethridge of Texas Tech University's agricultural economics
department. ``I also see that there is some weakness in the domestic
demand for cotton, and that is certainly affecting the market
price.''
   Ethridge attributed the weakness in demand to a sluggish economy.
   But the High Plains economy should pick up as a result of
consecutive bountiful harvests, said L.J. Richardson Jr., president
of First National Bank in Brownfield, Texas.
   ``Since agriculture is the base of the economy in Brownfield ...
it just has a tremendous impact on our local economy and the
financial institutions,'' he said.
   The influx of deposits from last year's crop boosted First
National to a record $94 million in assets.
   ``We expect that when we get this crop in, we'll reach the $100
million mark,'' he said.
   Despite the hopeful outlook, weather-related misfortunes could
still befall the cotton before it's out of the field later this
month, said Supak.
   ``What would tend to hurt us would be weather systems that would
come in here with ice and snow and moisture,'' he said. ``Cotton is
very vulnerable at this stage to weathering and will lose its color
if exposed to moisture.''

<HEAD>Corporate American Gifts Finds Just The Right Present</HEAD>

   Because a Japanese sees red if handed a
gift wrapped in white, a pair of Connecticut entrepreneurs are
getting a nice reception for their business helping executives
select and send presents to associates in the United States and
abroad.
   Seven months ago, Lydia V. Klatsky and partner Elizabeth R. Gray
invested $40,000 to launch Corporate American Gifts.
   Klatsky and Gray bring crafts to executives' offices for
selection, advise clients, wrap and ship gifts to domestic or
foreign locations.
   The crafts are one-of-a-kind pieces culled from American artists,
whom the two meet during scouting excursions around the country.
They attend major craft shows and drop in on artists.
   ``We feel it's really important that Americans give American
gifts abroad,'' Klatsky said.
   The gifts, which range in price from just under $5 to a $12,000
library oak table designed by Craig Nutt, suit a variety of tastes
among both givers and receivers.
   For conservatives there are hand-made leather binders, exquisite
glass paperweights and hand-carved wooden clocks. Tiny executive toy
boxes filled with bronze ``toys,'' burl wood boxes with secret
compartments and lacquered puzzle cubes with several faces appeal to
the more adventuresome.
   ``Very often the person doing the buying doesn't have the time or
the inclination to go shopping,'' Klatsky said.
   But more important for the convenience for some gift-givers is
the knowledge Grady and Klatsky have of the customs of other
cultures.
   ``They'll come to your office with appropriate samples after a
brief phone conversation in which we identify the nationality of the
recipients and other factors which influence the type and value of
the gift one wants to provide,'' said K. Grahame Walker, president
of the Dexter Corp. in Windsor Locks, Conn.
   ``You have to be careful when purchasing gifts for anyone,
particularly for the Japanese,'' Walker said, noting that even the
color of certain gift wrapping paper can offend particular cultures.
   For example, white is a color of mourning in Japan and would be
inappropriate as gift wrap, Gray said, while black or purple
wrapping paper would be considered offensive in some Latin American
cultures.
   Klatsky, a registered nurse, and Gray, who worked in advertising
with her husband, now have among their clients Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp., Cigna Corp. and Gerber Scientific Inc.
   They declined to release sales figures, but said they expected to
make a profit in their first year.
   To develop the savvy necessary to advise buyers, Klatsky and Gray
researched what gifts are appropriate for specific countries, but
such information is scarce.
   Klatsky said she once turned to the White House for advice. Her
quest eventually led to the person in charge of presidential gift
giving, who acknowledged the dearth of information on the subject
and asked Klatsky to forward a Corporate American Gifts catalog when
it's finished next spring.
   ``There are certain countries where one gift is acceptable and
another is not,'' Gray said.
   ``You don't give the Japanese anything with a fox or a badger on
it. The inference is that foxes are cunning ... and the badger is a
scavenger.''
   People of various cultures also react differently to expensive
gifts.
   ``Saudi Arabians give very lavishly and you are expected to
reciprocate. But you might run into trouble with that in South
America,'' where an expensive gift could be perceived as too
intimate, Klatsky said.
   Similarly, in some Latin American countries handkerchiefs are
associated with tears and sorrow, the women said.
   While the concept of fine American crafts appeals to many U.S.
companies, if left to their own devices executives' good intentions
sometimes backfire, the partners note.
   In one instance recalled by Klatsky, ``a major American
corporation gave clocks to a Japanese company, thinking they were
American made, only to discover they were made in Japan.''

   If the makers of Ruffies are accurate in their
view of America, making gains in the garbage bag business is a
matter of appealing to the nation's conscience.
   Poly-Tech Inc., of Bloomington, Minn., is launching a line of
degradable plastic trash bags with hopes that U.S. households will
pay a little extra for Ruffies knowing they have the potential to
turn to dust.
   ``We've gotten just a tremendous response,'' said Robert
Doernbach, chairman and chief executive officer of Poly-Tech, a
company founded in 1958 by flamboyant philanthropist Percy Ross, who
sold out in 1969. ``It's going to be interesting to see if people
will go out and buy those products.''
   It's not the first time degradable garbage bags have been
marketed, but Doernbach says Ruffies is the first nationally
advertised brand to make the move.
   ``On their part it's smart marketing,'' said Frank Rolfes, a
securities analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. of Minneapolis. ``I think
people like to do the environmentally right thing.''
   By adding photo-sensitive material to the plastic compound, the
bags break down when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the
sun. Once the chain reaction begins, the bags eventually are reduced
to a fine powder, the company says. The bags will completely degrade
in about three months in direct sunlight, the company says.
   But there's a catch. Doernbach said bags must be exposed to the
sun a minimum of about seven days for the breakdown process to begin
_ give or take a few days depending on seasons and the bag's
distance from the equator.
   Given the dark nature of landfills, ``most bags won't degrade
with the way they are normally used,'' Rolfes said.
   Still, degradable bags are helpful in the fight against litter
and even the darkest landfill can't stop the degrading process of a
bag once it starts, Doernbach said.
   The technology will add about a dime to the retail cost of a
package of 30 tall kitchen container-sized bags, which vary in price
from $1.99 to $2.69 depending on where they are sold.
   ``Hopefully, there's some profit there, but it's not a wildly
profitable thing,'' Doernbach said.
   Ruffies, with about 400 employees in Bloomington, Denver and
Battleboro, N.C., controls about 8 percent of the total U.S.
consumer trash bag market while its two other national competitors _
Glad and Hefty _ each has about a 30 percent share, Doernbach said.
   Poly-Tech posted $71.8 million in revenues in 1987 but earned
just $472,000. Rolfes said the degradable bags could give Poly-Tech
a small sales edge in some locations, but not enough to make a
``night-and-day difference'' because the product could easily be
duplicated by competitors if it skyrockets.
   Rick Tanner, product manager for Glad trash bags in Danbury,
Conn., said he's neither surprised nor worried about the change in
Ruffies.
   ``This is not a hot button with consumers,'' Tanner said.
``(Poly-Tech) is responding to special interests.''
   Tanner and Allen Gray, a spokesman for Mobil Corp., which makes
Hefty bags, said it's a waste of time and resources to make garbage
bags degradable.
   ``The degrading process takes far, far too long to create extra
space in landfills,'' Gray said. ``The money is much better spent on
real solutions to the problems.''
   Although plastics only account for an estimated 7.2 percent of
the country's solid waste as measured by weight, many experts
believe plastics pose a much greater problem than the figures reveal
because they are so light.
   About 9.6 million tons of plastic were discarded in the United
States in 1984 and the volume is expected to increase 9.8 percent to
15.5 tons by 1990.
   Recycling, garbage incineration and reducing the stream of solid
waste are environmental causes more worthy of corporate concern,
Gray said.
   ``It's a matter of taking care of the volume that we generate and
reducing that volume,'' he said.
   Still, Hefty will be keeping an eye on Ruffies sales to see what
consumers want.
   ``Mobil's position has been, if the market demands that the bags
be made biodegradable we'll do it,'' Gray said.

   Sharon and Larry Jangula feared this year's
drought would force them off their farm, until one of the nation's
largest travel agencies moved 20 computer terminals into a vacant
local storefront.
   Her part-time bookkeeping jobs did not earn enough, and the
alternative was driving 60 miles to Bismarck each day for a
full-time job.
   ``It was becoming reality that we had to do something,'' before
the Philadelphia-based Rosenbluth Travel Agency opened an office in
Linton and hired 40 local farmers and farmwives as data processors,
Mrs. Jangula said.
   The $5-an-hour, part-time jobs have helped many families hurt by
the drought put food on their tables this fall.
   ``It's not going to save the farm, but it really helps out,''
said Mrs. Jangula, who was hired as coordinator of the office.
   The agency, for its part, discovered that being a good samaritan
can sometimes be good business.
   By employing farm families to punch customer profile data into
computers, the agency thought it could help the farmers survive
their misfortune while saving the company money on overtime it was
paying elsewhere, said Diane Peters, the agency's marketing manager.
   Hal Rosenbluth, the travel agency's president, ``just decided it
was our social responsibility to help,'' she said.
   The only requirement for employment was that workers be from farm
families. ``Because that was where the greatest effect of the
drought was going to be felt instantaneously,'' Rosenbluth said in a
telephone interview.
   Without any prompting from government, Rosenbluth took it upon
himself to find out what his successful travel business could do to
improve the lot of the drought-stricken farmers.
   ``He saw the plight of the people in that area. He realized they
were good business people, but that nature had just dealt them a bad
hand,'' Peters said.
   ``He looked at work that needed to be done and said why can't
those people do it.''
   The Rosenbluth agency is one of the nation's top three corporate
and vacation travel agencies and expects more than $700 million in
sales in 1988, Peters said.
   It is the official travel agency of some 1,300 major U.S.
corporations, including the Eastman Kodak Co., E.E. du Pont de
Nemours & Co., General Electric Co. and the NBC television network,
and employs 2,000 people at 160 offices in 33 states and abroad, she
said.
   To find out where his company's assistance might be most needed,
Rosenbluth contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture. After being
directed to North Dakota, the travel agency hooked up with state and
local officials who led Rosenbluth to Linton, population 1,450, and
Ashley and Napoleon, each with about 1,000 residents.
   The drought dealt an estimated $2.1 billion blow to North
Dakota's economy, or 10 percent of the state's gross business
volume, according to economists at North Dakota State University.
The state's agricultural sector lost $700 million.
   ``They decided on Linton because they had the type of building
best suited for what they wanted to do,'' said Ron LeClerc, rural
development coordinator for the state's Economic Development
Commission.
   The 40 workers in Linton come from seven towns in a 30-mile area,
said Mrs. Jangula, the only full-time employee at the office.
   The travel agency originally intended to hire 20 full-time
workers, but when 90 people applied for the jobs, it decided to hire
40 part-time employees instead, Peters said.
   ``We decided it would be better to impact 40 families,'' she said.
   Jim Weisser, president of the Linton Industrial Development
Corp., said the extra income is helping many of those families
survive.
   ``It's just in some cases the difference of buying groceries or
not,'' he said. ``This has really given us a boost in attitude more
than anything.''
   The agency flew computers and trainers to Linton to open a
temporary office Aug. 8 for a three-month trial, Weisser said. The
development corportion chipped in $1,000 for two months' rent and
coaxed local residents to wage a letter-writing campaign to show
their interest in keeping the office open, he said.
   The office did such a good job during the trial period,
Rosenbluth quickly decided to make it a permanent addition to the
company fold.
   The travel agency is now the town's fourth biggest employer,
surpassed only by the county, school and hospital, according to
Weisser.
   Although the Linton office was the first one his agency has
opened that was not requested by a client, it may not be the last,
Rosenbluth said.
   ``What we do is very electronic,'' he said. ``It could be in
Linton; it could be in Maine. ... The key is to be where we have
some very fine associates.''

<DATELINE>PORTO VELHO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind his ramshackle wooden counter
Luiz Ferreira Costa sells anything from toilet paper and cigarettes
to cooking oil and rice, literally for the price of gold.
   His prices are calculated in grams of the yellow metal _
one-tenth of a gram (worth about $2) for a dozen eggs or a half a
gram for 2 pounds of coffee.
   Costa's customers are part of an estimated 1 million prospectors
who have invaded Brazil's vast Amazon rain forest to tap its rich
gold deposits.
   Fortunes are made. But the gold rush also is creating widespread
violence, smuggling, tax evasion, health problems, environmental
pollution and even the disturbance of primitive Indians.
   The gold dust, which Costa carefully weighs on his scale, comes
from the bed of the Madeira River that flows past Teotonio, a small
prospectors camp 25 miles from Porto Velho, capital of the western
jungle state of Rondonia, about 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   ``This is my way of digging for gold,'' said Costa, a
58-year-old, pot-bellied, toothless man who claimed he was too old
to put up with the rough-and-tumble life led by most gold diggers.
   According to Jose Altino Machado, a director of the Gold
Prospectors Federation, there are close to 3,000 gold-digging sites
spread out over the 2 million square miles of the so-called Legal
Amazon, comprised of the states of Amapa, Para, Roraima, Maranhao,
Goias, Acre, Rondonia, Mato Grosso and Amazonas.
   Since the late 1970s, ``close to 600,000 newcomers have swelled
the ranks of the 400,000 professional prospectors who have been
working in the region for years. And if you include spinoff services
such as food, equipment, transportation and prostitution, the number
of people living off the gold rush jumps to 7 million,'' Machado
said.
   Most prospectors were poor peasants fleeing Brazil's
drought-ridden Northeast. But over the past few years ``businessmen,
doctors and lawyers have also become gold diggers. They make more in
six months than in five years behind their desks,'' Machado said.
   He said a prospector extracts on the average at least 50 grams of
gold (worth about $1,000) a month.
   Most work for well-established entrepreneurs who take 70 percent
of the production in exchange for equipment, transportation,
medicine and food. ``Very few get rich,'' Machado said.
   But fortunes are made in the jungle. About 5,000 prospectors have
earned at least $1 million, and some 200 are worth more than $5
million, he said.
   Most of the gold from the Amazon never finds its way into the
national economy. Buyers who purchase the gold directly from the
prospectors hoard it or acquire dollars as a hedge against
inflation, or smuggle it out of the country to evade income and
mineral extraction taxes.
   Marcos Antonio Maron, an official of the Mines and Energy
Ministry's National Mineral Production Department, said, ``lack of
funds and manpower make it almost impossible to police the vast
expanse of land on which the gold digging sites are located.''
   In an interview, Maron said that of the estimated 100 tons of
gold produced in Brazil in 1987 ``only 35 tons were registered with
the government.'' For 1988, he estimated a ``real production of 110
tons versus a registered production of no more than 55 tons.''
   Ministry figures show that between 1977 and 1986 almost $23
billion of gold was ``detoured from the economy.''
   In terms of real production, Brazil ranks sixth among the world's
largest gold producers coming after South Africa, the Soviet Union,
the United States, Canada and Australia.
   Maron said Brazil has known reserves of 1,000 tons of gold. He
said geological studies have not been made to pinpoint gold reserves
in the Amazons ``but all told I would estimate Brazil has a
potential of producing about 30,000 tons of gold.''
   ``A lot of gold is found inside Indian territory. This has led to
several conflicts, especially with the Yanomami tribe in the
northern state of Roraima, near the frontier with Venezuela,'' Maron
said.
   Police and army troops occasionally evict prospectors from Indian
territory, ``but they keep coming back,'' he said.
   Machado admitted prospectors work near Indian territory, ``but
never invade it. It is the Indians who enter prospectors' camps and
dig for gold and they are always welcomed.''
   Amazon gold comes from huge open-pit mines or is blasted from the
earth with high pressure water hoses, pumped from riverbeds or
simply panned by solitary prospectors.
   The most serious environmental hazard posed is the use of
mercury, a metallic chemical element used to join gold dust
particles.
   The mercury is burned off the gold, emitting a highly toxic gas
that enters the atmosphere and can be inhaled by the prospector. The
toxins can cause nervous disorders and genetic deformations in
offspring.
   Maron said 180 tons of mercury enter the Amazon's ecosystem every
year ``affecting the region's flora and fauna and poisoning the
rivers.''
   Along a 370-mile stretch of the Madeira River, some 5,000 dredges
daily suck up huge amounts of gravel, which yield more than 4 tons
of gold a year.
   Near the Teotonio prospectors camp, Paulo Oliveira employs 16 men
on his two dredges, which operate 24 hours a day. Seventy-three feet
below, hoses acting like giant vacuum cleaners pump up about 6 tons
of gravel per hour.
   On hundreds of small barges, competing with dredges for space,
divers plunge into the dark, muddy waters, hand-carrying smaller
versions of the suction hoses.
   Joaquim Lins, 23, dives twice a day. Air, pumped through a tube
by an engine on the barge, allows him to remain underwater for two
hours at a time.
   Lins' profession is a dangerous one. He runs the risk of bursting
his lungs by getting his air tube tangled with those of other divers
or with the dredges' hoses. Divers are also known to cut their
rivals' air supplies.
   ``Scores die this way each year,'' Lins said as he prepared to
dive.
   But it's not only divers who die for gold. Each day at least four
people are shot dead in Teotonio ``mainly because they didn't obey
our unwritten code of ethics,'' said Oliveira.
   ``Here it's live and let live and work and let work. Anyone who
doesn't follow this rule dies.''
   Machado, Oliveira and other prospectors interviewed denied
reports that drug traffickers from neighboring Bolivia and Colombia
cross frontiers to exchange cocaine for gold.
   ``But we have information of traffickers buying gold with dollars
as part of their money-laundering process,'' Machado said.
   More than 1,000 gold fever-stricken prospectors enter the Amazon
each year hoping to strike it rich, and according to Machado, ``Very
few will leave the jungle, because once you come down with the fever
you never want to recover.''

<HEAD>Bipartisan Commission Chairman Says Gasoline Tax Hike Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-chairman of the National Economic
Commission told oil industry executives Tuesday that an increase in
the gasoline tax could become a reality under the new administration.
   Robert S. Strauss, a prominent Texas Democrat, said a new tax on
gasoline had been discussed as one possible way to help reduce the
federal government's huge budget deficit.
   ``A great many experts feel ... that if indeed additional revenue
is needed ... that a gas tax or a broad-based energy tax is
something the government should look at very strongly,'' Strauss
told some 1,500 participants at the closing session of the American
Petroleum Institute's annual meeting.
   However, Strauss declined to say whether he had or would
recommend a new gasoline tax to the commission, a bipartisan body
formed to make recommendations on reducing the budget deficit.
   During the three-day meeting, industry leaders have spoken out
against new taxes, arguing that the oil industry is the most heavily
taxed in the nation.
   Amoco Corp. Chairman Richard M. Morrow has called the retail
gasoline tax the ``single most regressive form of taxation,'' one
that would tax the low income most heavily and have a harmful
regional impact.
   Morrow, who also is chairman of the trade group, said Tuesday
that while President-elect George Bush had promised not tol
resources, it is more environmentally acceptable than other fossil
fuels _ and particularly so in addressing such concerns as ozone,
acid rain and the greenhouse effect,'' Morrow said.

^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. airlines have put off for another week the elimination
of a popular category of discount air fares, the so-called ``junk
fare'' used by major business travelers.
   The cuts, which represented an industrywide restructuring of
discount fare programs, had been scheduled to take place today.
   But officials of several carriers said today they had decided to
extend the deadline to Nov. 22. Continental Airlines, which
initiated last Friday the move to eliminate the fares, has extended
them for the same period, according to travel agents. Continental
spokesmen were unavailable for comment today.
   ``Other carriers made that move and we simply matched it,'' said
Al Becker, a spokesman for Dallas-based American.
   Becker said he could not provide an explanation for the
postponement. However, the New York Times reported today one reason
for the change was that some carriers, including Trans World
Airlines, had not yet put the new fares into effect.
   ``I think all the airlines are watching each other,'' said United
spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, said the airline
had joined in the delay because of confusion among passengers and
travel agents over elimination of the discount fare.
   ``I think passengers became confused and travel agents and we
wanted to give time for them to sort these issues out,'' Gibbons
said.
   The fare changes involve the discontinuation of most three- to
seven-day advance-purchase fares.
   Besides having the relatively short advance-purchase requirements
the so-called junk fares often did not require a traveler to stay at
the destination on a Saturday night. They also were between 10
percent to 35 percent below full coach fare.

   The United States will need just about as much
imported steel next year as this year even if an economic recession
reduces overall steel consumption, a leading steel importer said.
   The requirement for foreign steel will be a central issue in
Washington, D.C., as debate heightens over the extent to which
President-elect George Bush should renew steel import quotas due to
expire next Sept. 30.
   Domestic producers cannot sustain production much above 80
percent of rated capacity, and exports are expected to grow, said
Fred Lamesch, president of the importer TradeARBED Inc. of New York
and past president of the American Institute for Imported Steel.
   For this year, domestic shipments are expected to reach 83
million tons, imports 21 million tons and exports 2 million tons,
leaving total U.S. consumption of 102 million tons, he said Monday
night in New York during an address to members of the Association
for Steel Distributors Eastern Region.
   ``Let's assume steel consumption drops five million tons to 97
million tons next year. If, as widely forecast, exports rise by two
million tons, we would still need 20 million tons of imported steel
in this market. And for specific products and regions, dependence on
imported steel is much greater,'' Lamesch said.
   Lamesch said domestic producers can be expected, among other
things, to begin filing unfair trade cases as early as spring, as
they lobby for an extension of the trade restraint agreements.
   ``Domestic producers prefer a situation in which the sum of their
own capacity plus imports does not surpass a level that will
threaten future price stability,'' the importer said. ``In practice
that translates into an effort, first to keep closed domestic
capacity from being reopened and, second, to extend and expand
restraint agreements.''

<TEXT>
   Small businesses are feeling better about the
economic outlook these days, with an increasing number thinking
about adding more jobs, building new plants and maintaining
relatively high inventory levels.
   But don't expect to see too much in the way of salary increases
over the next few months, according to the latest quarterly survey
by a leading trade group.
   The National Federation of Independent Business _ whose 500,000
member firms employ about half the country's non-farm work force _
reports that its small-business optimism index rose to 102.9 in
October from 100.5 in July.
   The seasonally adjusted index, which assumes conditions that
existed in 1978 equal 100, reached a high of 108.7 in January 1984
and a low of 81.1 in April 1980. Earlier this year it had been
slippping.
   ``Firms had become decidedly less optimistic about future
economic growth during the year,'' explained William C. Dunkelberg,
dean of Temple University's business school and originator of the
survey.
   ``But the declines of early 1988 were reversed in October ...
returning to levels that prevailed in 1986 and early 1987.''
   The data compiled in the survey of 2,084 small responding
businesses includes predictions on expected business conditions, the
climate for expansion, earnings, job openings and hiring plans and
plans for capital outlays.
   Dunkelberg said the overall sentiment of responding firms could
be summed up this way: ``There is still no sign that there is
substantial weakness in the economy or that a recession is likely to
start anytime before mid-1989.
   ``Strong earnings are supporting strong plans to hire and spend
on inventories and capital projects.''
   Among details of the report:
   _Eighteen percent of the firms plan to increase total employment
in the next three months, while 11 percent plan reductions. The
percentage of firms with job openings set a record for the current
expansion, rising to 25 percent and surpassing the previous high of
23 percent last January.
   ``The employment rate should continue to fall under such
pressure,'' the report said.
   _Twenty-nine percent reported raising prices in the third
quarter, unchanged from the previous period, while 8 percent reduced
prices, down two percentage points from July. Plans to lift prices
fell one percentage point from July levels, to 25 percent of all
firms.
   ``Although not large, there is a clear upward drift in the
percent of firms planning to raise prices. (But) ... non-food
inflation should fall off somewhat in the fourth quarter,'' the
report said.
   _Planned capital outlays rose to an all-time seasonally adjusted
high of 35 percent. Fifty-five percent reported outlays in the last
six months, although the spending rate is still nine percentage
points below the high level set in 1979.
   _Plans to add to inventories were unchanged from July levels, but
remained strong in comparison to the past four years. Seventeen
percent planned to add to inventories, while 17 percent planned to
reduce.
   ``Accumulations have been heavy among retail and wholesale firms,
perhaps in anticipation of the Christmas selling season,'' the
report said.
   _The percentage of firms borrowing on a regular basis rose to 38
percent from a record-low 35 percent of all firms. ``Apparently
profits and cash flow are sufficient to meet he capital needs of
most small firms.''
   _Twenty-six percent reported increases in employee wages in the
third quarter of 1988, up one percentage point from the previous
period. Plans to increase wages rose three percentage points to 21
percent of firms.
   ``With job openings at expansion-high levels, there is still
little evidence that compensation is responsiding in any substantive
way to labor market tightness,'' the report said.

<HEAD>British Airways' Profit Down 2 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC reported that its profit
declined 2 percent in its second quarter as its 1987 acquisition of
British Caledonian Airways continued to reduce earnings.
   Britain's largest airline said Tuesday that its net profit in the
three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 91 million pounds, or around
$165 million, from 93 million pounds, or $168 million, a year
earlier. Per-share earnings slipped to 12.6 pence, or 23 cents, from
12.9 pence, or 23 cents at prevailing exchange rates.
   The decline occurred despite a 12 percent rise in second-quarter
revenue, to 1.19 billion pounds, or $2.2 billion, from 1.06 billion
pounds, or $1.9 billion.
   The latest quarterly results for the airline were in line with
most analysts' forecasts.
   In the first six months of its fiscal year, British Airways'
profit fell 5 percent to 144 million pounds, or $261 million, from
151 million pounds, or $273 million. Per-share earnings declined to
20 pence, or 36 cents, from 20.9 pence, or 38 cents.
   Half-year revenue rose 13 percent to 2.21 billion pounds, or $4
billion, from 1.96 billion pounds, or $3.5 billion.
   Results for the former British Caledonian operations, acquired by
British Airways last year for 253 million pounds, or $458 million,
were included in the figures for the current fiscal year but not in

   British Airways Chairman Lord King said second-quarter results
from most market segments were satisfactory but that there was a
disappointing performance from European and British operations.
   ``The winter months are our most vulnerable period,'' he said.
``However, present (passenger) traffic levels remain high for this
time of year and our forward bookings are ahead of last year.''

<HEAD>Siemens Offers To Inspect, Fix Circuit Breaker Boxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of I-T-E circuit breaker boxes is
offering to inspect and repair, if necessary, breaker boxes which
could overheat and malfunction, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission announced Tuesday.
   According to the manufacturer, Siemens Energy and Automation Inc.
of Alpharetta, Ga., some of the breaker boxes were made with
incorrect components.
   The I-T-E circuit breaker boxes, or ``load centers,'' can be
identified by the five-digit code marked on top of the wiring
diagram label inside the door. Those in question are:
   H2586-H3186, made Aug. 25-31, 1986.
   J0186-J30-86, made Sept. 1-30, 1986.
   K0186-K2486, made Oct. 1-24, 1986.
   If the wiring diagram has a sticker labeled ``inspected lugs,''
it already has been checked and corrected if necessary, Siemens
reported. Anyone finding boxes with the codes in question but
without the inspected sticker should contact Siemens at
1-800-334-2982 or the Safety Commission, 1-800-638-2772.

   member firms employ about half the country's non-farm work force _
reports that its small-business optimism index rose to 102.9 in
October from 100.5 in July.
   The seasonally adjusted index, which assumes conditions that
existed in 1978 equal 100, reached a high of 108.7 in January 1984
and a low of 81.1 in April 1980. Earlier this year it had been
slippping.
   ``Firms had become decidedly less optimistic about future
economic growth during the year,'' explained William C. Dunkelberg,
dean of Temple University's business school and originator of the
survey.
   ``But the declines of early 1988 were reversed in October ...
returning to levels that prevailed in 1986 and early 1987.''
   The data compiled in the survey of 2,084 small responding
businesses includes predictions on expected business conditions, the
climate for expansion, earnings, job openings and hiring plans and
plans for capital outlays.
   Dunkelberg said the overall sentiment of responding firms could
be summed up this way: ``There is still no sign that there is
substantial weakness in the economy or that a recession is likely to
start anytime before mid-1989.
   ``Strong earnings are supporting strong plans to hire and spend
on inventories and capital projects.''
   Among details of the report:
   _Eighteen percent of the firms plan to increase total employment
in the next three months, while 11 percent plan reductions. The
percentage of firms with job openings set a record for the current
expansion, rising to 25 percent and surpassing the previous high of
23 percent last January.
   ``The employment rate should continue to fall under such
pressure,'' the report said.
   _Twenty-nine percent reported raising prices in the third
quarter, unchanged from the previous period, while 8 percent reduced
prices, down two percentage points from July. Plans to lift prices
fell one percentage point from July levels, to 25 percent of all
firms.
   ``Although not large, there is a clear upward drift in the
percent of firms planning to raise prices. (But) ... non-food
inflation should fall off somewhat in the fourth quarter,'' the
report said.
   _Planned capital outlays rose to an all-time seasonally adjusted
high of 35 percent. Fifty-five percent reported outlays in the last
six months, although the spending rate is still nine percentage
points below the high level set in 1979.
   _Plans to add to inventories were unchanged from July levels, but
remained strong in comparison to the past four years. Seventeen
percent planned to add to inventories, while 17 percent planned to
reduce.
   ``Accumulations have been heavy among retail and wholesale firms,
perhaps in anticipation of the Christmas selling season,'' the
report said.
   _The percentage of firms borrowing on a regular basis rose to 38
percent from a record-low 35 percent of all firms. ``Apparently
profits and cash flow are sufficient to meet he capital needs of
most small firms.''
   _Twenty-six percent reported increases in employee wages in the
third quarter of 1988, up one percentage point from the previous
period. Plans to increase wages rose three percentage points to 21
percent of firms.
   ``With job openings at expansion-high levels, there is still
little evidence that compensation is responsiding in any substantive
way to labor market tightness,'' the report said.

   Share prices drifted higher Tuesday in uninspired
dealings on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 8 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 1,802.3.
   Volume was 341.8 million shares, compared with the 479.9 million
shares traded Monday.
   Some selected shares were energized by takeover talk, dealers
said, but added that they saw few substantive moves in prices.
   ``Institutions are still out of the game and without them, we
can't expect to cover much territory,'' one trader said.
   Dealers said they were encouraged by the fact that the index
managed to close above the psychologically important 1,800 level.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index edged up 8.4 points
to 1,460.9.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 4.16 points to 1,026.11.

   Stock prices were mixed today in a light session
that reflected investor reluctance to participate ahead of the

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had lost 62.41

<TEXT>
   Go-Video Inc., which makes video
cassette recorders, has agreed to accept cash settlements from three
defendants in a $1.5 billion antitrust suit, the firm's chairman
said.
   Chairman R. Terren Dunlap said Monday that his company had agreed
to accept settlements from Hitachi Ltd. of Japan, the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan and Goldstar Co. Ltd. of Korea.
   In return for the settlements, Go-Video agreed to dismiss the
three as defendants in the lawsuit.
   The suit, pending in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, alleges that
the defendants conspired to block the manufacture and marketing of
Go-Video's dual-deck video cassette recorder in the United States.
There originally were 26 defendants, including Japanese and Korean
manufacturers and the Motion Picture Association of America.
   Settlements have been reached with 17 of the defendants,
including the Motion Picture Association, Dunlap said.
   The terms of the settlements have not been disclosed because of
confidentiality agreements and a court order, Dunlap said.
   ``Although we can't reveal the amounts until we are required to
do so by law, we believe they properly reflect the seriousness in
which the defendants are taking the case,'' Dunlap said. ``Go-Video
is determined to recover its damages and ensure the availability of
the dual-deck VCR to the American public.
   Dunlap said the lawsuit is expected to go to trial in March.
   Go-Video holds a patent in the United States for a dual-deck VCR
tht it intends to market under the VCR-2 trademark.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures End Sharply Lower On Late Sell-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as a late round of speculative
selling sent soybean and corn prices down sharply.
   Prices were weak throughout the session amid bearish chart
signals and disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain
exports.
   The Agriculture Department's announcement late Monday of a
300,000-metric-ton corn sale to the Soviet Union failed to rally the
corn market, which was expecting a Soviet corn purchase of up to 2
million metric tons.
   Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for Balfour
Maclaine Corp. in Chicago, said most of the selling was done by
speculators while the outnumbered buyers were largely commercial
traders.
   ``There's just not enough cash business right now to support
these price levels,'' Zusel said. ``And if you can't go up, you've
got to go down.''
   At the close, wheat was 5\ cents lower to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.15{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 5\ cents lower with December at $2.66\ a bushel; oats were 3
cents lower to { cent higher with December at $2.10} a bushel; and

   Oil futures prices drifted lower Tuesday in dull,
directionless trading, reversing the gains of the previous session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
declined 37 cents to settle at $13.90 a barrel, after rising 32
cents on Monday.
   Other contract months also lost ground.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 46.96 cents, down
1.20 cents. The contract had risen 1.51 cents Monday.
   The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which rose
0.62 cent in the previous session, fell 0.23 cent to settle at 44.40
cents.
   William Byers, senior energy analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co.,
said technical factors dominated trading in the absence of any
market-moving news.
   ``It was so dull, incredibly quiet. There was nothing to say
about the market,'' he said.
   Many traders were attending the American Petroleum Institute's
annual convention in New York while those who remained at their
desks stayed on the sidelines in advance of upcoming OPEC meetings.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was scheduled
hold pricing and strategy committee meetings on Thursday followed by
a full meeting of all 13 ministers next Monday.

<HEAD>Polls Finds Budget Gap Biggest Concern of Small Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of the nation's small-business owners
believe the federal budget deficit is the No. 1 issue facing
President-elect George Bush, and they favor spending cuts to reduce
the shortfall, a poll said Tuesday.
   The 21,000 entreprenuers responding to Arthur Anderson & Co.'s
third annual Small Business Survey also expressed general optimism
about the economic outlook despite the lingering budgetary problems.
   Two-thirds of those polled said the deficit was the most pressing
issue of the day. Forty-five percent listed tax rates, 26 percent
domestic programs, 25 percent foreign policy and 15 percent defense
spending.
   The respondents were asked to pick the two most important
political issues facing the incoming administration.
   Spending cuts were picked by 55 percent of those surveyed as the
best solution to the deficit problem, while 44 percent favored both
spending cuts and increased taxes.
   ``Emerging and owner-managed businesses appear to see taxes as
both a concern and a reality,'' said James P. O'Halloran, an Arthur
Anderson partner.
   ``To reduce our deficit, most small businesses prefer a reduction
in spending by cutting defense spending, welfare and foreign aid.''
   As far as the economy was concerned, 60 percent of the
respondents predicted they would record at least a 5 percent gain in
sales in the upcoming year, with 35 percent foresaw an increase of
more than 10 percent.
   Three-fourths estimated profits would stay the same or increase
over last year.
   ``In past studies, the executives' predictions have been right on
target because they are aware of their competitive environment and
the pressures facing small business, and are committed to setting
and reaching optimistic goals,'' O'Halloran said.
   Arthur Anderson, based in Chicago, is one of the world's largest
accounting and tax consultants.

   Stock prices creaked to a mixed finish today in a
particularly slow session, reflecting widespread reluctance to
participate ahead of the government's potentially market-jolting
monthly trade report.
   ``The only thing I've noticed is nothing's happened,'' said
Edward P. Nicoski, a technical analyst at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood
Inc., a Minneapolis-based investment firm. ``Everybody's just
waiting to see what those numbers are going to do.''
   The Commerce Department is due to report the September
merchandise trade balance Wednesday morning and most expectations
are for a $10.5 billion shortfall. If the deficit exceeds that
amount, some fear it could trigger a selloff in the dollar, stock
and bond markets.
   The trade statistics vary widely from month to month but remain
one of the most sensitive market movers. That's largely because the
huge trade deficits the United States has been racking up over the
past several years are seen by many economists as a reflection of
eroding economic might.
   Wall Street strategists said other figures released today that
showed higher retail sales and industrial production in October
caused little reaction in the market.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Reports Third-Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said Tuesday its third-quarter earnings
declined 6.7 percent, while Dayton Hudson Corp. said its income rose
35 percent during the period and Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.
reported a 5.6 percent earnings gain for its first quarter.
   Penney said its third-quarter earnings declined to $160 million
from $171 million in the same period a year earlier. Penney's
per-share earnings increased to $1.17 from $1.14 as it had 13
percent fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter.
   Penney attributed some of the earnings decline to accounting
changes.
   The company said its revenue totaled $3.61 billion, down from
$3.76 billion a year earlier.
   The retail industry has been struggling through a slump that
began in February 1987. Some companies, like Penney, are still
showing profit declines. Other companies have showed earnings gains,
but securities analysts caution that the results, when compared with
last year's depressed numbers, may look stronger than they really
are.
   Dayton Hudson said it earned $45.6 million, or 54 cents per
share, in the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $33.6 million, or 34
cents per share, in the comparable period a year ago.
   Third-quarter revenue increased to $2.87 billion from $2.54
billion for the same period in 1987.
   Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton
Hudson, said sales at its Mervyn's department stores strengthened
during the quarter because of improved inventory content.
   Mervyn's has been a trouble spot for Dayton Hudson in the past.
   The company also owns Dayton's and Hudson's department stores and
Target discount stores.
   Carter Hawley Hale said it had earnings of $11.3 million, or 52
cents a share, during its first quarter, compared with $10.7
million, or 49 cents per share in the same period a year ago.
   Carter Hawley Hale said it had a $4 million operating loss in the
latest quarter.
   The company, parent of the Broadway, Emporium Capwell,
Thalheimers and Weinstock's department stores, said sales were
$636.7 million in the quarter, up from $610.6 million in the same
period a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Penney said it earned $372
million, or $2.74 per share, compared with $328 million, or $2.18 a
share, in the comparable 1987 period. The 1987 results included a
$140 million pre-tax charge for the relocation of Penney
headquarters to Dallas from New York.
   Revenue during the period totaled $10 billion, down from $10.39
billion.
   Dayton Hudson's net earnings for the nine months were $104.9
million, or $1.24 per share, compared with $94.7 million, or 97
cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first nine months increased to $8.1 billion from
$7 billion a year ago.

<HEAD>Industry Facing Serious Energy Problems, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falling energy prices and rising profits at many
oil companies are concealing more serious industrywide problems that
a national energy policy must address, the American Petroleum
Institute said Tuesday.
   ``The truth is that the state of the nation's energy health today
is perceived as `good' only because enough inexpensive foreign oil
is available,'' the industry's main trade group said in a report.
``Our condition could turn to `poor' or `critical' if that supply
were disrupted ....''
   The report, ``Energy Security White Paper: U.S. Decisions and
Global Trends,'' was issued during the group's annual meeting.
   The survival of domestic exploration and production is in
question as lower crude prices discourage investment in new oil
development, the report said.
   Dependence on foreign oil, primarily from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has increased U.S. vulnerability to
the dangers of a supply disruption and price volatility, it said.
   Despite recent huge quarterly profits by major oil companies, the
gains came in ``downstream'' sectors such as refining and chemical
manufacturing, said Charles J. DiBona, president of the trade group.
But the favorable earnings were offset at least partly by losses in
``upstream'' _ production and exploration operations _ stemming from
low crude prices.
   The paper calls for a national energy policy to ensure an
adequate and secure supply of oil at reasonable prices while
reducing vulnerability to a future oil crisis.
   The report does not specifically call for tax incentives to help
offset the crude prices, but contends correct ``government
decisions'' could increase domestic oil supply by 2 million barrels
a day by the end of the 1990s.
   Only 921 oil rigs are working in the United States, compared with
about 1,000 a year ago and 4,000 in 1981, the group noted. Those
rigs are producing approximately 8 million barrels of oil a day and
output is falling 3 percent a year while demand is rising about 2
percent annually, the report said.
   Consequently, foreign imports have soared to 43 percent from 31
percent just three years ago and some economists predict that in
five years the United States may be importing half of its oil.
   The report said dependence on foreign supplies, primarily from
the Middle East, increased U.S. vulnerability to a supply disruption.
   With demand increasing rapidly, the current glut of oil on world
markets could dry up in the 1990s, the report said.
   ``Then any number of unpredictable developments around the
Persian Gulf could directly, swiftly and critically affect oil
supply,'' the paper said.
   In addition, another steep plunge in oil prices, like that which
occurred in 1986, threatens the survival of smaller oil companies,
damages the economies of oil states dependent on the industry for
revenue and ``hurts the country's long-term energy security,'' the
report said.

other company officials to answer murder charges in the 1984 gas
disaster that killed 3,100 people.
   The prosecutor sought the warrants after Anderson and other
executives of the U.S. company failed to respond to summonses issued
in December.
   ``They are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law,''
government prosecutor U.S. Prasad said.
   A spokesman at Union Carbide's headquarters in Danbury, Conn.,
said Indian courts had no jurisdiction over Anderson or the company.
   ``Union Carbide Corp. is not an Indian corporation,'' said Earl
Slack, the company's assistant director of corporate communications.
``It has no presence in India and under Indian law can have no
presence in India.''
   The charges are in addition to a still-unresolved $3 billion
damage suit filed against Union Carbide and its Indian subsidiary by
the Indian government.
   The Indian government argues the leak was a result of negligence.
   ``We believe that the energy expended in the pursuit of
ill-founded criminal charges in India to be more productively
invested in getting aid to the victims or in revealing evidence that
would confirm that the tragedy was caused by sabotage,'' Slack said.
   The Bhopal pesticide plant, where toxic gas leaked out of a tank
and wafted over nearby shantytowns, was operated by Union Carbide
India Ltd., in which Union Carbide holds a 50.9 percent stake. The
remaining stock is owned by Indian interests.
   In addition to 3,185 deaths counted by the government, more than
20,000 people were injured when they inhaled the lethal methyl
isocyanate.
   The Indian government filed its damage suit in early 1986.
   Last year, the government filed the separate murder charges
against Anderson, Union Carbide Corp., its Hong Kong-based
subsidiary Union Carbide Eastern Inc. and eight officers of the
Indian subsidiary. Anderson retired in late 1986 after reaching the
company's mandatory retirement age,of 65.
   The only arrest warrants issued Tuesday were for Anderson; John
MacDonald, assistant secretary of Union Carbide Corp.; and Peter J.
Whitley, attorney for Union Carbide Eastern Inc.
   Neither MacDonald nor Whitley was named in the murder charges.
   Prasad, the prosecutor, said he sought warrants for MacDonald and
Whitley because they were the people who took receipt of the
summonses issued to their firms.
   Prasad also said the Indian government might start extradition
proceedings if the trio ignored the arrest warrants.
   In granting the request for arrest warrants, chief judicial
magistrate R.C. Mishra said the three men could be released on
$1,000 bail apiece if they appeared in court.
   Mishra is not hearing any actual trial cases, but his job
empowers him to preside over some procedural matters, such as
failure to answer summonses and whether to commit a case to trial by
a higher court.

   Some people in the computer industry
mistakenly blame computer ``viruses'' for anything that goes wrong,
an independent computer security consultant says.
   ``Out of over 1,400 complaints to the Software Service Bureau
this year, in only 2 percent of the cases was an electronic virus
the cause of the problem,'' Chrles Wood said. ``People are jumping
to the conclusion that whenever a system slows down, it's a virus
that's responsible.''
   Wood and other panelists at a 15th annual computer security
conference cautioned that computer-dependent companies should focus
more on the day-to-day breakdowns caused by human error than on the
kind of virus introduced recently into a government-supported
computer network.
   Robert Morris Jr., a 23-year-old Cornell University graduate
student, allegedly unleashed the virus in the nationwide
6,200-computer government-supported network called Arpanet. He is
the subject of an inquiry by the FBI and U.S. attorneys in two
states.
   That incident ``could be a cheap lesson,'' Steve Irwin, president
of LeeMah Datacom Security Corp., said Monday. ``We were lucky
because it was not a real malicious attempt ... If Morris had
ordered the programs to be erased, the loss could have gone into
billions, lots of zeroes.''
   Wood said: ``The virus is the hot topic right now, but actually
the real important subject is disaster recovery planning. But that's
not as glamorous as the viruses.''

   The Farmers Home Administration began mailing
thousands of notices Tuesday to farmers who are past due on loans,
and members of Congress vowed to scrutinize the post-election timing
of the move.
   Agency spokesman Marlyn Aycock said about 83,500 letters would be
mailed through Nov. 25.
   The agency had said earlier that 90,000 letters would be sent in
an effort to collect $8.8 billion in past-due loans, but Aycock said
some had since been paid up. The collection effort comes under rules
implementing new credit legislation.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, accused the FmHA of holding the letters back
until after the Nov. 8 presidential election for ``political
reasons,'' although the agency had the letters in hand ``well before
the election.''
   ``That is no way to administer a program that is so important to
our nation's farmers, and it is no way to treat the 6,500 or so
Texans who are getting the letters,'' said Bentsen, who was the
Democratic nominee for vice president.
   ``The Farm Credit Act of 1987, legislation on which I worked long
and hard, may give us the means to restructure some of the overdue
loans so that we do not push farmers into foreclosure
unnecessarily,'' Bentsen said. ``That is where I will focus my
attention in the days ahead. I urge the Farmers Home Administration
to do the same.''
   FmHA is considered the farm lender of last resort because it
makes loans only to those who cannot qualify at banks or other
commercial sources.
   Rep. Glenn English, an Oklahoma Democrat and member of the House
Agriculture Committee, said he was ``certain that the actions of the
Farmers Home Administration will be scrutinized by both the House
and Senate agriculture committees with an eye toward whether Farmers
Home has carried out both the letter and the intent of the 1987
Agriculture Credit Act.''
   The letters inform borrowers who are more than 180 days late of
their options. The notices explain that FmHA borrowers must notify
the agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make
arrangements for settling their debts. Details regarding the
options, including debt restructuring and writeoffs, will be
provided.
   Congress in the Farm Credit Act ordered FmHA to revise its
lending practices, with the debt write-down considered one of the
most important parts of the law. It allows FmHA to reduce a farmer's
delinquent debt to the recovery value of the collateral, which is
usually land or farm equipment, depending upon cash flow and other
factors.

   The U.S. dollar edged downward Tuesday in
uncertain trading in advance of Wednesday's report on the nation's
merchandise trade deficit for the month of September.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $423.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from
$422.85 late Monday.
   Forecasts of the trade deficit ranged widely from $9 billion to
$11 billion. Traders said any number above the range would be likely
to drive the dollar lower, while a figure below the range probably
would spark a rally.
   ``Eight or 12 (billion dollars) is clearly going to move the
markets,'' said Wayne Lyski, a portfolio manager of Alliance Capital
Management in New York.
   Trade deficits and the markets' reaction to them are notoriously
difficult to predict. Currency dealers said sentiment toward the
dollar is predominantly bearish, and any rally caused by a good
trade number might be quickly swamped by a wave of selling.
   The trade deficit in August was $12.2 billion.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was slightly helped
Tuesday by the government's report of a rise of 0.9 percent in
retail sales in October, the biggest increase in seven months.
Strong economic growth attracts investors to dollar-denominated
securities.
   The market shrugged off a 0.4 percent advance in industrial
production in October, which fell within expectations, traders said.
   In contrast to other recent sessions, there were no reports of
intervention by central banks to support the dollar against other
currencies. The dollar had rallied on Monday on the strength of
central-bank purchases and reassuring statements from officials of
the United States, Japan and West Germany.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 123.25 Japanese yen from 123.00 yen
Monday. Later in London, the dollar traded higher at 123.40 yen.
Later in New York, the dollar fell to 123.23 yen from 123.75 yen
Monday.
   In London, one British pound fell to $1.8060 from $1.8090 late
Monday. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.8083 from $1.8074.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7433 West German marks, down from 1.7465; 1.4626
Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 1.2337 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2313; 5.9535 French francs, down from 5.9635; and 1,297.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,300.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7465 West German marks, up from 1.7452; 1.4630
Swiss francs, down from 1.4645; 5.9660 French francs, up from
5.9615; 1.9685 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9735; 1,300.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,303.50, and 1.2344 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2297.
   Gold prices moved higher, but traders said there wasn't enough
interest in the metal to sustain a big rise.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $424.07 a troy ounce, up from
$422.51 an ounce late Monday. Gold closed in London at $423.75 a
troy ounce, up from $420.95 late Monday. The late Zurich price was
$423.00 an ounce, up from $420.00.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $424.40 a troy ounce from $423.90 at Monday's close.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $6.41 a troy ounce, up from
$6.39 late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $6.368 a troy ounce from $6.418 an ounce Monday.

<HEAD>California Computer Company Launches Bid for Prime Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California computer company controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow launched an unsolicited takeover
offer on Tuesday for the much larger Prime Computer Inc. that values
Prime at $970 million.
   MAI Basic Four Inc., which already owns 4.1 percent of Prime's
48.5 million outstanding shares, is offering shareholders $20 a
share for the remainder of the stock.
   The bid comes about 11 months after Natick-based Prime launched a
hostile bid for Computervision Corp., a Massachusetts manufacturer
of computer-aided design, or CAD, systems which it eventually
acquired for $435 million.
   Prime's stock remained below the offering price, rising $1.87{ a
share to $17.75 a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading. MAI Basic fell $1 a share to $11.37{ a share.
   ``This is unusual, one computer company trying to acquire another
computer company,'' said Bruce Jenkins, an analyst with Daratech, a
Cambridge research firm. ``We do not see this as a technological fit
or a customer fit. It has to do with benefit to stockholders.''
   Jenkins also suggested that in making the offer, MAI Basic may
inspire other offers for Prime. MAI Basic, based in Tustin, Calif.,
may be looking to be acquired by the company itself, Jenkins said.
   John Dexheimer, an investment banker with Broadview Associates,
also said MAI Basic's bid appeared to be purely for financial gain.
   ``It's a straight, smart financial move,'' said Dexheimer. ``The
question now is, does he (LeBow) really want to go ahead with it?''
   LeBow owns 43 percent of MAI Basic's stock with an associate,
William Weksel. LeBow also controls Western Union and Liggett Group
Inc. and recently asked the Federal Trade Commission for clearance
to buy more than 50 percent of American Brands Inc.
   Both Prime and MAI Basic Four are manufacturers of midrange
business computers. Prime is now a leading supplier of integrated
computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering systems, having
recently agreed to acquire General Electric Co.'s Calma unit, a CAD
systems maker. That acquisition makes Prime second only to
International Business Machines Corp. in the CAD market.
   The offer is contingent upon MAI Basic getting at least 67
percent of Prime's outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis.
   MAI Basic has said that it has filed a lawsuit against Prime and
its board in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to block Prime's
shareholder rights plan, a defense against unwelcome takeovers.
   The company has also sued Prime in a federal court in
Massachusetts seeking relief with regard to certain Massachusetts
state takeover laws.
   MAI Basic said it had lined up financing from Canada Imperial
Bank of Commerce and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Drexel Burnham and
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets are the dealer-managers for the offer.
   For the nine months ended Oct. 3, Prime earned $33.4 million, or
69 cents a share, on revenue of $1.16 billion.
   For the nine months ended June 30, MAI Basic had net income of
$18.7 million, or $1.25 a share, on revenue of $302.9 million.
   LeBow informed Joe Henson, president and chief executive officer,
of the bid in a telephone call Monday night, according to Joe
Gavaghan, a spokesman for Prime.

   Stocks advanced marginally Tuesday and volume
fell to the lowest level in seven weeks, reflecting investor
reluctance to participate ahead of the government's potentially
market-jolting monthly trade report.
   Brokers said buying was largely limited to the components of the
Dow Jones industrial average, which finished with a 12.09 gain to
2,077.17, snapping a four-session losing streak. Most broader market
barometers nudged higher.
   The Commerce Department was due to report the September
merchandise trade balance Wednesday morning and most expectations
were for a $10.5 billion shortfall. If the deficit number
substantially exceeds that amount, some fear it could trigger a
selloff in the dollar, stock and bond markets.
   ``Everybody's just waiting to see what those numbers are going to
do,'' said Edward P. Nicoski, a technical analyst at Piper Jaffray &
Hopwood Inc., a Minneapolis-based investment firm.
   Although the huge trade deficits racked up by the United States
can vary widely from month to month, they remain one of the most
powerful market movers and have become a symbol of American economic
weakness.
   Despite widespread reluctance by investors to participate in the
stock market ahead of the trade-number release, some Wall Street
strategists said the conditions have been laid for some gains over
the next several days.
   ``I think barring something totally unforeseen in terms of a
negative trade number, we're setting ourselves up for a fairly
significant rally,'' said John Conlon, executive vice president and
director of equity research at Nikko Securities Co. International in
New York.
   ``There's been a lot of liquidation over the last week or so by
traders and a good deal of skepticism in the market,'' he said.
``That's a potent combination for stocks to go up.''
   Others were more cautious, based on technical analyses that
showed a lack of demand for stocks.
   ``We're oversold enough to give us a pop, but based on breadth, I
really don't think we'll get much to the upside,'' Nicoski said.
   Advancing issues barely outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 715 up, 709
down and 534 unchanged.
   Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 115.17 million shares, down from
142.90 million in the previous session. It was the lowest level of
trading since a 113.72 million-share day Sept. 28.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 137.24 million shares.
   Prime Computer led the NYSE's most-active list, rising 1~ to 17}
on volume of 2.3 million shares. New York investor Bennet Lebow
undertook a $20 a share offer for the company.
   J.C. Penney rose 1 to 53 after it reported third-quarter earnings
that exceeded expectations. Among other retailers, Dayton Hudson
rose ] to 39| after it reported a 35 percent gain in third-quarter
earnings.
   Among gaining blue chips, Woolworth rose ~ to 51\, General Motors
rose } to 81[ and IBM rose ] to 117{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $3.264 billion or 0.12
percent in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.29 to 151.33.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.71 to 308.44, and S&P's
500-stock composite index rose 0.62 to 268.34.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.22 to 372.14.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.19
to 289.59.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge Despite Continuing Strike in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices plummeted Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange as edgy speculators ignored bullish supply-and-demand
factors and sold heavily on fears that the market had topped.
   On other markets, precious metals were mixed; grains and soybeans
were lower; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; energy
futures retreated; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The miners' strike in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper
producer, entered its fifth week with no hint of a settlement but
most futures traders sold the market anyway.
   Copper settled 2.7 cents to 6.1 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $1.299 a pound and the spot November
contract at $1.369 a pound, about 17 cents below the record high of
$1.538 reached Nov. 2.
   ``The market is caught in the throes of bearish sentiment,'' said
George Anagnos, metals market analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   ``It's sort of like a snowball going down a hill,'' Anagnos said.
``It tends to gain momentum to the downside.''
   The sell-off was sparked by weakening technical signals, the
chart patterns followed by many speculators, he said. As more people
sold, prices kept falling to levels that triggered further selling.
   But Anagnos noted that last year's extraordinary copper rally,
which saw prices hit $1.46 a pound on New Year's Eve, included a
20-cent correction, so the price slide of the past two weeks was not
unprecedented.
   ``This doesn't indicate the market is incapable of resuming its
upside move,'' he said. ``The fundamental situation to me still
portends upward prices.''
   In addition to the Peruvian strike, bullish fundamentals include
tight supplies and strong demand for copper, which is heavily used
for construction and by almost every industry.
   Gold futures rose slightly but silver prices fell on the
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 40 cents to 60 cents higher with December at $425.60
a troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.2 cents lower with December at
$6.393 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices settled at a 3{-month low on the Chicago
Board of Trade on a late round of speculative selling. Corn also
finished sharply lower while wheat futures were mixed.
   Prices were weak all session amid bearish chart signals and
disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain exports. Even
the Agriculture Department's announcement late Monday of a
300,000-metric-ton corn sale to the Soviet Union did not rally the
corn market, which was expecting a Soviet corn purchase of up to 2
million metric tons.
   Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for Balfour
Maclaine Corp. in Chicago, said most of the selling was done by
speculators while the outnumbered buyers were largely commercial
traders.
   ``There's just not enough cash business right now to support
these price levels,'' Zusel said. ``And if you can't go up, you've
got to go down.''
   Wheat settled 7 cents lower to 1} cents higher with December at
$4.13} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 5{ cents lower with December at
$2.66 a bushel; oats were 3} cents lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.10 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 15{ cents lower
with November at $7.43{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled sharply higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, buoyed by improving cash markets and strong buying by
commercial players, analysts said.
   Pork futures enjoyed some spillover support from the adjacent
cattle pits but gains were limited by expectations of lower cash
prices on Wednesday and concerns about the rapid buildup of pork
bellies in cold storage.
   Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.25 cents higher with December
at 73.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to 1.30 cents
higher with November at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent
lower to .38 cent higher with December at 41.05 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .40 cent higher with February
at 44.87 cents a pound.
   Oil futures prices drifted lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in dull, directionless trading, reversing the gains of the
previous session.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 37 cents
lower with December at $13.90 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to
.69 cent lower with December at 44.40 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .55 cent to 1.20 cents lower with December at 46.96
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted modest gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled .65 point higher at 269.50.

   A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday
refused to oust U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack from presiding
over the civil insider trading case against investment giant Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In a 2-to-1 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
declined to intervene and remove Pollack over an alleged conflict of
interest. The Wall Street firm did not immediately say whether it
will appeal further.
   But the decision was welcomed by officials at the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which brought the massive civil-fraud case
against Drexel more than two months ago.
   ``Naturally we're pleased,'' said Daniel Goelzer, general counsel
for the SEC in Washington. ``We didn't feel that Judge Pollack was
required to recuse (disqualify) himself and the court agreed with
us.''
   Drexel has claimed that it is playing a key role in financing the
acquisition of Palais Royal Inc., a Houston-based retailing company
in which Pollack's wife Moselle is a major stockholder.
   Although she has no direct relationship with Drexel, Mrs. Pollack
stands to gain about $35 million in the transaction.
   Drexel and other defendants, including Drexel's high-yield bond
financier Michael Milken, have contended that their connection to
the judge's wife creates an appearance of partiality by Pollack
toward them. They have requested another judge that would make the
case free of any possible taint.
   In sometimes heated court sessions, Pollack, an 82-year-old
jurist with a pro-government reputation, balked at stepping aside,
calling the Drexel move an ``illusionary diversion.''
   Other lawyers familiar with the case have called the Drexel move
a tactical strategy to get another judge because of fear by defense
attorneys that Pollack would rule harshly against the firm.
   ``We conclude that an objective observer knowing and
understanding all the facts and circumstances could not reasonably
question Judge Pollack's impartiality,'' wrote Circuit Judge Richard
J. Cardamone, with Judge Lawrence W. Pierce concurring.
   But Judge J. Edward Lumbard disagreed in a sharply worded
dissenting opinion, saying: ``It is clear to me that a reasonable
person knowing these ultimate conceded facts would reasonably
question Judge Pollack's ability to supervise such litigation
impartially.
   ``Such a reasonable person's next question would be `Why hasn't
the judge stepped aside?' Moreover, Judge Pollack's expressed
resentment to the suggestion of recusal and his castigation of
Drexel and its counsel has confirmed these doubts. He cannot act
impartially in these cases,'' Lumbard wrote.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said ``we naturally are
disappointed with today's decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals. We
have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and we will be doing
so in the next few days.''
   The SEC filed a 184-page civil fraud complaint against Drexel,
Milken and three other employees Sept. 7, accusing them of trading
on inside information, cheating clients, manipulating stock, keeping
phony books and other violations.
   The SEC also claimed Drexel used the organization of convicted
takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky as a front for its alleged
illegal activities.
   The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.

   Car and light truck sales by U.S. automakers rose
14.9 percent in early November compared with results a year ago that
were depressed by the absence of buyer incentives.
   The seven manufacturers assembling cars and light trucks in the
United States said Tuesday they sold 295,497 vehicles during the
Nov. 1-10 period this year, compared with 228,665 vehicles during
the same time last year.
   That amounted to a 14.9 percent increase in the daily sales rate.
There were nine selling days during the period this year and eight
last year.
   U.S. automakers have sold 10,190,150 vehicles in 1988, a 7.6
percent increase over the 9,437,194 sold during the Jan. 1-Nov. 10
period last year. There have been 266 selling days so far this year,
one more than at the same time last year.
   ``That's very olid,'' analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman
Hutton of New York City said of the sales figures. ``Our outlook
calls for continued moderate steady growth without any ripples.''
   Ron Glantz, an auto analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in
San Francisco, said, ``The '89 model year is starting off very, very
well.''
   Part of the reason for the increase in year-to-year sales was a
lack of incentives in early November last year. The super-low
financing and big cash-back offers of last summer ended with the
1987 model year on Sept. 30, 1987.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported
they sold 172,325 cars during the Nov. 1-10 period this year
compared with 130,062 during the same period last year, a 17.8
percent daily sales increase.
   Ford recorded the largest period-to-period increase, selling
57,275 cars in early November this year, compared with 40,877 during
the same period last year, a 24.5 percent rise in the daily sales
rate. Since New Year's Day, the nation's No. 2 automaker has sold
1,923,078 cars, a 9.4 percent increase from the 1,750,770 it had
sold during the same period last year.
   GM, the industry's sales volume leader, sold 88,238 cars during
the first 10 days of this month, a 16.4 percent rise in daily sales
over the 67,364 cars it sold during the same time last year. For the
calendar year, GM has sold 0.7 percent more cars in 1988 than 1987,
rising to 3,167,132 cars this year from 3,133,795 last year.
   Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 carmaker, said it sold 26,812 cars
in the Nov. 1-10 period this year, compared with 21,821 cars sold
during the same time last year _ a 9.2 percent increase in daily
sales. Chrysler also said it has sold 930,457 cars so far in 1988, a
11.7 percent increase over the 829,958 cars it had sold between Jan.
1-Nov. 10 of last year.

<HEAD>Virulent Citrus Canker Suspected in Central Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A virulent form of citrus canker may
have been detected again in a commercial grove in Central Florida,
state Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner announced Tuesday.
   The area in Manatee County already is under restriction because
of previous discoveries of citrus canker A strain in 1986, the
announcement read.
   The discovery was only the second time the canker has been found
in a commercial Florida grove in recent years.
   State and federal plant pathologists ``are conducting extensive
tests on suspicious samples taken from navel orange, red and pink
grapefruit and Hamlin orange trees,'' said a release by Conner's
office.
   In the meantime, officials are surveying the area around the
suspect groves to take action if the tests prove positive, Conner
said.
   There was no response to a telephone call to the agriculture
department seeking elaboration on the announcement, which was made
late Tuesday afternoon.
   After canker was detected in Florida in 1984, federal authorities
declared a temporary embargo on citrus shipments, and the state
burned an estimated 20 million citrus trees. The state has since
been ordered to pay the owners of many of the trees who argued that
agriculture authorities acted too hastily in destroying many groves
not affected by canker
   A meeting of the joint state-federal Citrus Canker Technical
Advisory Committee has been called for Friday in Palmetto to
recommend regulatory measures, Conner said.
   The canker tentatively has been identified as the A strain, the
release said.
   ``Considered one of the more virulent strains of the disease, it
can spread rapidly, producing premature fruit drop as well as stem,
fruit and leaf lesions,'' Conner said.
   The A strain was discovered in the summer of 1986 on residential
trees on Anna Maria Island, in St. Petersburg and in one commercial
grove in Manatee. Since those discoveries, movement of citrus in
Manatee, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties has been strictly
regulated.
   A total of 3,600 infected trees have been discovered to date in
those areas, Conner said.

   The rate of occupational injuries and disease
is on the rise again, with more than 6 million cases last year,
including 351,000 more injuries and 53,000 more illnesses than in
1986, the government said Tuesday.
   A 5 percent jump in the incidence of job-related illnesses and
injuries, from 79 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 83 per 1,000
workers last year was the first increase since 1984, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics said.
   The AFL-CIO blamed the increase on a ``lack of enforcement'' of
federal safety standards and regulations by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
   However, directors of OSHA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics
said at least part of the increase can be attributed to better
record-keeping brought about in part by stiff fines against
companies that under-report job accidents to the government.
   Meanwhile, job-related fatalities in surveyed private businesses
with 11 or more employees dropped from 3,610 in 1986 to 3,400 last
year, a decrease that BLS officials called ``statistically
insignificant.''
   A total of 5,843,100 on-the-job injuries were reported last year,
compared with 5,492,000 in 1986.
   Nearly half of the injuries were serious enough to cost a full
day or more of work, and the number of workdays lost totaled 48.8
million, compared with 45.4 million workdays lost to injuries in
1986.
   About 190,000 workers _ nearly 39 percent more than in 1986 _
suffered job-related illnesses in 1987, most of them noise-related
hearing losses, skin diseases and repetitive motion ailments such as
carpal tunnel syndrome, prevalent in the meatpacking industry.
   The bureau said chronic and long-term latent cases that are often
difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in
the illness statistics ``but are clearly understated.''
   Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood said the increase
in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better
record-keeping resulting from new government guidelines and
intensive efforts to improve the statistics.
   For example, the BLS last year trained some 14,000
representatives from companies employing a total of 20 million
people on keeping accurate injury and illness records.
   The training plus a crackdown by OSHA on recordkeeping violations
followed several years of complaints that companies were
under-reporting illnesses and accidents as a way of avoiding OSHA
inspections.
   Among others, the National Academy of Sciences last year
questioned the validity of the government's job health and safety
data because of ``severe under-reporting'' by employers.
   An academy panel said the actual number of job-related fatalities
could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau.
   During the first five years of the Reagan administration, OSHA
targeted its inspectors on plants with higher-than-average injury
and illness rates. Critics said that merely gave employers an
incentive to under-report them.
   However, in the past two years, OSHA has levied hundreds of
fines, some of them in the millions of dollars, against
manufacturers for not reporting job-related injuries or illnesses.
   ``Over the short run, improved reporting will mean higher injury
and illness rates,'' said Assistant Labor Secretary John A.
Pendergrass, who heads OSHA. ``But over the long run it should
improve workplace conditions.''
   Diane Factor, an industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO,
acknowledged that part of the increase is likely due to better
records. But she said job-related illnesses and injuries are still
severely under-reported, particularly in high-hazard industries like
logging and agriculture where OSHA has not targeted its enforcement
resources.
   ``Workmen's compensation data from several states, which is not
dependent on employers' record-keeping, also show substantial
increases in injuries,'' Ms. Factor said. ``In Ohio, for example,
the workmen's comp data show a 15 percent increase last year in
construction injuries.''
   The BLS data show a decline in construction injuries and
illnesses, from 152 per every 1,000 workers in 1986 to 147 per 1,000
last year. In every other industry, the incidence rate was either
the same or higher last year.
   Of the 3,400 reported on-the-job fatalities last year, two-thirds
occurred in the construction, manufacturing, transportation or
public utility industries. As in previous years, the single biggest
cause was traffic accidents, accounting for about one-third of the
deaths, the government said.
   The highest incidence of injuries continued to be the lumber and
wood products industry, at 186 per 1,000 workers, the same rate as
1986. Second was the metal industry with an injury rate of 163 per
1,000 workers, up from 133 per 1,000 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Merv Griffin Becomes New Owner of Resorts International</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Merv Griffin became the
new owner of Resorts International Inc. on Tuesday, taking control
from developer Donald Trump after months of haggling with financiers
and gaming regulators.
   Griffin paid $96 million for Trump's controlling block of Class B
shares, or $135 a share. He paid another $201 million for the less
powerful Class A shares, or $36 a share.
   The transaction will be completed Wednesday when Griffin pays
Trump $63 million to terminate his management contract with Resorts.
   ``Sixty-three million for six months' work _ that's not bad,''
Trump said.
   Griffin on Wednesday also will sell Resorts' unfinished Taj Mahal
casino project to Trump for about $273 million.
   ``That's $300 million less than Resorts already has put into it,
so as you can see, I'm very happy,'' Trump said.
   Griffin said after Tuesday's closing in New York that ``it's been
a long, exhausting process.''
   ``In April, we felt it was a completed deal, but there were so
many assets involved,'' he said. ``It's not just buying a hotel,
it's buying an island, a surveillance company, real estate, aircraft
_ it has so many pieces that it was almost impossible to put it
together.
   ``It all came together today, though, in a stack of paper about
100 feet high.''
   Asked what advice he has for Griffin, Trump said, ``He has to
work hard. It's going to be a very tough deal. He's got the problem
of the Taj's debt and he's taking over a facility that's 60 years
old.''
   ``He will have to invest millions in it,'' Trump said. ``He also
is taking over the place in the Bahamas that has a brand-new casino
opening next to it. More millions will have to be spent to bring it
up to date.''
   ``It looks like he could lose $50 million a year in this
transaction,'' Trump said.
   Under terms of the deal, Griffin will make $25 million in
improvements to Resorts' Atlantic City casino and another $25
million to the Bahamas operation.
   Griffin said he believed both parties ``came out even'' in the
deal. He acknowledged that the Resorts' facilities are old, ``but
they are also charming.''
   ``I purchased the most famous house in Atlantic City,'' he said.
Having the massive Taj Mahal open next door ``only benefits us _ it
will bring a lot of people.''
   Griffin said his first plan of action will be to start capital
improvements on the properties ``so that when the Taj opens and
people taste this end of the Boardwalk, Donald will be content with
my spillover.''
   Griffin, a former big band singer and talk show host, has
developed a number of television game shows, including ``Wheel of
Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.''
   He financed the Resorts deal through a $325 million bond offering
and will contribute $50 million in equity into Resorts. One of the
conditions that Griffin wanted met before securing the deal _ a $200
million tax break _ was granted by the Internal Revenue Service.
   Trump said he raised $675 million to complete the 1,250-room Taj
Mahal. Construction will begin again immediately, and the doors
should open in about 15 months, he said.
   Also Tuesday, Resorts International released its third-quarter
results, showing a $339.8 million net loss, the bulk of which comes
from the sale of the Taj Mahal and the cost of breaking the
management contract. That is compared to a net loss of almost $7
million in the same quarter in 1987.
   Revenue for the third quarter totaled $123.9 million, compared to
$118 million for the same quarter last year.
   The net loss for the first three quarters of 1988 was $357.4
million, compared to net earnings of $5.9 million for the first
three quarters of 1987.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $353.5 million, up from $348 million a
year earlier.
   Griffin has hired David P. Hanlon, president of Harrah's Marina
Hotel and Casino, to run Resorts International's Atlantic City
gaming hall.
   The numerous parcels of property that Resorts owns in Atlantic
City will be sold ``little by little,'' Griffin said.
   ``It shouldn't be coveted _ it should be out there, made
available to people. There's a nice 15-acre zoned parcel on the
other side of Showboat that would make a very nice spot for
someone.''

<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC on Tuesday extended its
hostile $5.23 billion tender offer for Pillsbury Co. for the third
time, and said Pillsbury shareholders had tendered 79.1 percent of
the company's outstanding shares under the offer.
   The $60 a share offer, which was to expire Monday night, was
extended to Nov. 18.
   The offer, launched Oct. 4, is conditioned on the removal of
Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' defense. Judges in two states have left
the pill intact despite lawsuits from Grand Met and dissident
shareholders. The pill would make a takeover prohibitively
expensive. Further court action is pending on the issue.
   Grand Met said 67,595,940 shares of Pillsbury common stock had
been tendered and not withdrawn by the Monday night deadline.
   Pillsbury, which has rejected the bid as inadequate, had no
comment on the extension of the offer.
   Chairman Philip Smith has told Pillsbury shareholders they would
be better off keeping their stock in light of the food and
restaurant company's proposed spinoff of its Burger King business
into a separate public company.
   Pillsbury shareholders would receive a special dividend and stock
Burger King stock under the planned restructuring. The company also
is considering other moves to enhance shareholder value, Smith has
said.
   Separately, Burger King Chairman Jerry Levin met Tuesday in Miami
with key franchisees a day after Ian Martin, chief of Grand Met's
U.S. operations, met with the 15-member National Business Council,
the official representative of Burger King's 1,200 franchises.
   A number of franchisees are upset over Pillsbury's plan to spin
off Burger King, on the grounds that corporate support for their
businesses would decline from the surviving, debt-burdened company.
   Martin told franchisees that Grand Met would spend a significant
amount of money to renovate existing Burger King restaurants, build
more, and improve the company's marketing. The strategy could lead
to streamlining and management changes at Burger King headquarters
in Miami, Martin said.
   ``We think Burger King is a fantastic brand,'' Martin said in an
interview after the franchisee meeting at The Bilmore Hotel in Coral
Gables. ``You can't have more than 5,000 outlets with that brand
name and not have a tremendously powerful brand names.''
   ``I'm impressed. I'm very impressed with him,'' said Manny
Garcia, who owns 38 Burger King restaurants in central and northern
Florida. ``I think they'll do the things necessary to move the
system forward.''
   Martin said his company was ``paying very serious attention'' to
rumors that somebody, possilby inspired by Pillsbury, might mount a
takeover bid for Grand Met. He called the notion that Pillsbury
could take over Grand Met, in a so-called Pac Man defense against an
unwanted suitor, ``farfetched.''
   In such defense, a target attempts to thwart a hostile buyout by
taking over its suitor.

<HEAD>ICC Overturns Arbitrator's Ruling In New England Rail Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission on Tuesday
overturned a federal arbitrator's ruling that would have reinstated
union pay rates and work rules that were slashed by Guilford
Transportation Industries last year in a sweeping cost-cutting
reorganization.
   The ICC, on a 3-1 vote, ordered that union and company
negotiators return to the arbitrator's mediation table to try to
work out new pay rates and work rules for the freight line, the
largest privately-owned railroad in New England.
   Last year, Guilford reorganized its subsidaries, Boston & Maine
and Maine Central, putting them under Springfield Terminal, a tiny
rail line with much lower wage scales. Guilford officials argued
that the move was necessary to cut costs and keep the company
competitive.
   In June, arbitrator Richard Kasher ruled that workers transferred
to Springfield Terminal must be the wages they received under their
Boston & Maine and Maine Central contracts and be subject to the
work rules under those pacts.
   But ICC Chairwoman Heather J. Gradison, ruling Tuesday on an
appeal from the company, said the arbitrator's decision on pay rates
and work rules failed to give Guilford officials ``management
flexibility.''
   She voted with the majority to send the issue back to the
arbitrator and negotiators for mediation, although she noted that
``we have never seen anything to lead us to believe that (the two
sides) can or will come up with an agreement.''
   ``Our objective is we want to see this railroad operate. We want
to see management be fair to labor. We want to see labor be fair to
management,'' she said. ``It's tempting to impose a solution here
today, but we believe you understand your business better than
anybody else.''
   Commissioner Karen Phillips, voting with Gradison and
Commissioner Frederic N. Andre, said she feared that forcing
Guilford to comply with the old union wage scales and work rules
would cripple the company and its ability to compete.
   Guilford Transportation, the Billerica, Mass. company owned by
Timothy Mellon, a reclusive heir to the Mellon banking family of
Pittsburgh, reorganized last year, saying it could not compete under
the union wage and rule restrictions.
   In a statement released following the commission meeting, the
company said it would ``wok within the process prescribed by the ICC
in the hope that it will pave the way for the railroad to meet the
competitive challenges of the New England marketplace while at the
same time meeting the requirements of the railroad's employees.''
   Commissioner Paul H. Lamboley, the lone dissenter, said it was
inappropriate to ``dissect'' portions of the arbitrator's decision.
``You can't break out bits and pieces of it,'' he said, adding that
the commission was venturing into an area beyond its expertise.
   Eugene F. Lyden, international vice president of the United
Transportation Union, said he was disappointed with the commission's
ruling on pay rates and work rules, but applauded the panel's votes
upholding other sections of the arbitrator's decision.
   The commission ruled 4-0 to affirm Kasher's decision to provide
Boston & Maine and Maine Central workers not rehired by Springfield
Terminal with severance pay and benefits in accordance with the old
contracts.
   And the commission agreed that workers hired by Springfield
Terminal must receive the difference between their new salaries and
their old, higher wages for up to six years. But the workers would
be subject to the new work rules that Guilford officials say would
make the company more efficient.
   The commission also voted unanimously to require Guilford to
honor the seniority employees built up at Boston & Maine and Maine
Central.

   Sterling Plumbing Group Inc., a
subsidiary of Kohler Co., will purchase USG Corp.'s Kinkead
Division, a manufacturer of tub and shower enclosures, the companies
said Tuesday.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Kinkead employs about 425 people at manufacturing plants in Union
City, Tenn., and Hickman, Ky., and warehouses located throughout the
country, USG said.
   Sterling manufactures faucets, drain products, valves,
stainless-steel sinks and Vikrell bath fixtures.
   Chicago-based USG said it was selling Kinkead due to its recent
recapitalization and its decision to concentrate on its core
business of manufacturing and distributing gypsum wallboard and
other building products.
   Kohler, based in Kohler, Wis., is a leading manufacturer of
plumbing products. Kohler also makes engines and generators and
operates real-estate and hospitality services in east-central
Wisconsin.
   USG Chairman Robert J. Day said the company restructuring program
was proceeding as scheduled and that proceeds from the sale of
various divisions were expected to exceed the $535 million in
after-tax income originally envisioned.

<TEXT>
   Just days after initiating an industry move to
drop discounts aimed at business travelers, Continental Airlines
announced a restructured ``MaxSaver'' program Tuesday that is
expected to boost most remaining cut-rate fares.
   Continental said MaxSaver fares _ which are used by most vacation
travelers _ would be based on the length of a flight under the new
formula.
   Competition on individual routes, not mileage, had determined the
fares in the past.
   It was not immediately clear whether other big carriers would
follow Continental's move, but the airline has been the pacesetter
on fares in recent years.
   The airline planned to notify travel agents about the new fares
Tuesday night and Wednesday, spokesman Ned Walker said in a
telephone interview from Continental's headquarters in Houston. He
said the new MaxSaver fares would take effect next Wednesday.
   ``You will see some MaxSavers going up and some MaxSavers going
down,'' Walker said. ``We are returning air fares to a more rational
level.''
   He said fares for longer flights generally would be raised while
those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced.
   Some travel agents told about the changes said they appeared to
have the effect of raising roughly two-thirds of Continental's
MaxSaver fares and cutting the remaining third or so.
   ``They're going to raise it to the level that it should have been
in the first place,'' said Jack Bloch, the owner of JB's World
Travel in New York.
   MaxSaver tickets must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance
and require an overnight stay.
   Air fare structures have become geographically ``out of whack''
as a result of airlines frequently matching each other's fare
increases in recent months, said Robert Decker, an airline analyst
for Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   The changes come amid plans by Texas Air Corp. subsidiary
Continental and other big U.S. airlines to eliminate another
category of discount air fares _ the ``junk fares'' available four
to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business travelers.
   In a move initiated by Continental and followed by several major
carriers, the junk fares were slated to be eliminated on Tuesday.
But the airlines decided to extend the deadline by a week because of
confusion over the change.
   Only about 10 percent to 20 percent of all airline passengers use
the last-minute junk fares, according to some analysts' estimates.
   The popular MaxSaver fares, by contrast, are used by most
vacation travelers.
   More than 90 percent of air travelers use some form of discount
fare, be it last-minute or advance purchase, according to the Air
Transport Association, an industry trade group based in Washington.
   The discounts generally aren't available for flights during
holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Some examples of changes in Continental's one-way MaxSaver fares
are:
   _Between Newark, N.J., and Houston: current off-peak fare, $129;
current peak fare, $159; new off-peak, $139; new peak, unchanged.
   _Between Boston and Dallas: current off-peak, $149; current peak,
$169; new off-peak and peak, both unchanged.

<HEAD>Union Members Vote To Accept New Contract; Mickey Mouse Won't
Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a union coalition
representing 9,200 workers at Walt Disney World voted overwhelmingly
Tuesday to accept a new three-year contract, ending a strike threat
against the giant tourist attraction.
   Harvey Totzke, president of the six-union Service Trades Council,
reported union members voted 1,059-677 to approve the agreement,
which provided for immediate pay raises of 35 cents to 50 cents.
   Asked about two previous rejections of similar offers and
repeated calls by some union members for a strike, Totzke said: ``I
think they finally took a realistic look at the offer. I can say it
now it was a fair offer. We got all we could get.''
   Bill Ward, Disney vice president for labor relations, said, ``I'm
obviously very happy about it. We felt that we had a good contract.''
   Rejection by two-thirds of the voters would have authorized labor
leaders to call a strike.
   Among the workers represented by the Service Trades Council are
ride operators, sandwich makers, bus drivers, stockroom workers,
hotel housekeepers and clerks, animal handlers, monorail pilots and
the people who portray Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and other
characters.
   The company has said it was prepared for normal operations in the
event of a strike. Disney officials planned to fill park operating
jobs from among the 13,000-plus non-union employees, and from among
management, workers who chose not to observe a strike call and any
people hired after a strike call.
   The balloting was the second within four days.
   An election last Friday was nullified by union bosses who
discovered some workers voted more than once. Angry employees
rejected two earlier contract proposals, contending they did not
offer enough money for pay raises.
   The new contract provides pay raises of 50 cents an hour to
workers now at top scale, who earn from $6.80 to $9.70 an hour, and
raises of 35 cents an hour for workers below top scale, who now make
$4.85 to $9.20 an hour.
   In April 1990, workers at top scale would get pay hikes of 45
cents an hour, while those below top scale would receive 30 cents an
hour.
   Workers rejected an earlier package offering wage increases of 5
percent in the first year and 4 percent in each of the contract's
final two years, plus other benefits.
   Dissatisfaction by many union members dates back to 1985, when
the unions agreed to a two-year wage freeze and took one-time
bonuses instead. Two weeks later, the company announced record
revenue and profit for its 1985 fiscal year, union members said.
   The Service Trades Council is composed of the Service Employees
International Union, the Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees
Union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the Transportation
and Communication Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes One Contract Provision Pilots Said Hindered Buyout</HEAD>

   A federal judge has struck down a provision of
United Airlines' contract with union machinists, ruling the language
was intended to hinder the pilots union's attempt to buy the
carrier, union and company officials said Tuesday.
   The Air Line Pilots Association sued in April to block two
provisions in United's contract with the International Association
of Machinists on the grounds .
   The pilots union claimed the provisions were restrictive
covenants aimed at blocking its more than $4 billion proposal to buy
the airline, said ALPA spokesman Hank Krakowski in Chicago.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel on Saturday rejected one
provision, which would have prohibited the pilots' union from
participating in an employee ownership plan unless the machinists
and other unions agreed to the terms, Krakowski said.
   Russell Mack, United's vice president for corporate
communications, said late Tuesday the airline would have no comment
on the ruling.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins confirmed Zagel's rejection of the
provision, but said Tuesday he did not know the details of the
lawsuit or of the judge's decision.
   Krakowski said that under the stricken provision, any stock
ownership option tendered to the pilots would have to be offered to
the other unions and subjected to possible arbitration.
   ``We'd be in the position of trying to buy a company and not
knowing what the price was going to be until after arbitration,''
Krakowski said.
   Local 1487 of the Machinists, which negotiated the contract with
UAL, issued a statement confirming Zagel's rejection of the
provision, but made no further comment.
   Richard Delaney, president of the local, was in Florida on
Tuesday and would not be available for comment until next week, said
a union officer who declined to be identified.
   Zagel let stand the second provision challenged in the ALPA
lawsuit. That provision would give the Machinists a choice of
reneging on their existing contract or extending it for three years
in the event of any takeover.
   In April 1987, the machinists refused to join ALPA in its buyout
attempt, citing what union officials called philosophical and
technical problems with the pilots' proposal.
   Despite that refusal, ALPA officials said last December they
considered the possibility of a sympathy strike against United if
the machinists and the airline failed to agree on a contract.
   The machinists' pact, containing the two provisions challenged by
ALPA, was reached Nov. 15, 1987, hours before expiration of a 30-day
``cooling-off'' period.
   ALPA, which has made three offers to acquire the airline, has
enlisted the aid of a syndicate of banks and the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   The pilots' first proposal for a $4.5 billion employee takeover
of United was made in April 1987 and rejected by its parent UAL
Corp. that same month as inadequate.
   Two months later, in June 1987, ALPA came back with a
recapitalization plan, under which ownership of United would have
been transferred to employees and stockholders. The company also
rejected that proposal.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher; Stocks Up In Early Tokyo Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei closing, later
dollar trading, comments. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar moved higher against the Japanese
yen in Wednesday morning trading, while share prices rose to another
record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 123.58 yen, up from Tuesday's close of
123.25 yen, and by late morning was changing hands at 123.50 yen.
   Exchange dealers said activity was slow as investors waited for
the release of the U.S. Commerce Department's report on the nation's
September trade deficit, scheduled for later Wednesday in Washington.
   ``But in general, the market sentiment toward the dollar is
bearish,'' said an exchange dealer at a U.S. commercial bank in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main price index, rose 99.21 points from Tuesday's record close to
finish the morning session at 28,928.62, a record for the early
session.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said the Nikkei index
briefly topped the 29,000-point mark for the first time, but moved
back slightly due to profit-taking.
   ``Share prices appear to be as bullish as they can be,'' said a
dealer at Nikko Securities Co. in Tokyo. ``Financial shares were
down today but other shares, such as construction, are leading the
market.''
   The dealer said it was a good sign that different types of issues
were variously leading the market.
   ``As long as this sort of cycle continues, the Nikkei will
continue to grow for some time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rate Intitative Reaction Hit Business Harder than Consumers, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Most of the insurance companies that quit
selling and renewing policies after last week's voter approval of a
rate-cutting initiative have returned to the market, according to an
industry survey released Tuesday.
   But far fewer companies are offering homeowners' and business
liability policies, according to the survey by the Independent
Insurance Agents and Brokers of California.
   The survey, which gauged the market as of Monday, suggested that
fears of mass insurer defections from the California market after
last week's passage of Proposition 103 _ a ballot initiative that
would deeply cut insurance rates _ were exaggerated.
   Numerous companies suspended policy sales and renewals after the
initiative passed last Tuesday. But many have returned to the market
since the state Supreme Court, acting on an industry lawsuit, put
the measure on hold pending a trial.
   As of Monday, the brokers' group found, companies making up 81
percent of the California market were selling new auto insurance
policies. Renewals were being offered by companies representing 94
percent of the market.
   For reasons the group has yet to determine, the figures were far
lower for homeowners and business policies.
   Insurers accounting for 75 percent of the market for homeowners'
policies were selling new policies, while renewals were available
from companies making up 83 percent of the market.
   New commercial insurance policies were available from companies
holding just 54 percent of that market, and renewals were available
in 66 percent of the market.
   The figures are based on direct communication with 75 insurance
carriers that hold more than 90 percent of the market, and were
valid as of Monday, said Joseph Annotti, spokesman for the agents'
group.
   While the high court's stay has returned stability to the market,
the long-term health of the industry _ and the availability of
insurance to consumers _ depends on the outcome of the lawsuit,
Annotti said. He repeated frequent industry warnings that most
insurers would incur unacceptable losses if Proposition 103 were
upheld.
   The measure, backed by consumer crusader Ralph Nader, was
approved by voters who rejected four other competing initiatives
proposed by industry or trial lawyers' groups.
   Proposition 103's principal effect would be to roll rates for
nearly all types of insurance back to November 1987 levels, and then
impose an additional 20 percent cut.
