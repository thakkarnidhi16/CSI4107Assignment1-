   A man who wanted to have his wisdom
teeth pulled was mistakenly given a lethal dose of a local
anesthetic, authorities said.
   Rodney Scott Craig, 25, of San Bernardino died Saturday, two
days after he was given an overdose of lidocaine, Jim Beisner,
Chief Deputy Coroner of Orange County, said Wednesday.
   Investigators said an unknown person in the office of oral
surgeon Chris Larson mistakenly inserted intravenous lines into
Craig's arm that contained lidocaine instead of glucose, a sugar
solution used to raise blood sugar level.
   Beisner said he did not know how much lidocaine Craig received
before the mistake was discovered by Larson or his staff. Garden
Grove police Sgt. Phil Mason said the coroner determined there was
no criminal wrongdoing.
   The California Board of Dental Examiners was investigating the
death, said supervising investigator Larry Ballard.

<HEAD>Odds on Ending Drought a Bad Bet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The odds the government is putting on an end
to the drought over the next couple of months would likely be of
little interest to even the most dedicated riverboat gambler.
   The probability of getting enough rain to end the drought ranges
``from 1 in 500 for central Iowa to 1 in 1,000'' for at least three
other major drought regions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reports.
   And, looking back at history, even that may be optimistic.
   That's because never in the period that records have been kept
has rainfall in August, September and October in major
drought-plagued areas been enough to end a shortage equivalent to
today's.
   In this week's drought advisory, the National Climatic Data
Center takes a look at four specific drought areas, and what it
finds isn't encouraging.
   In central Iowa, for example, the amount of rain needed by Oct.
31 to end the drought totals 22.42 inches. That amount can be
expected in the August-October period only once in 500 years, the
advisory said.
   Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the Asheville, N.C., data
center, said those were the best odds found in the four areas
studied _ the other three all came out to one chance in 1,000 of
getting enough rain by the end of October to declare the drought
broken.
   Those areas are northeastern Montana, near the North Dakota
border, where 10.36 inches of rain would be needed to end the
drought; the east slope of the Cascades in Washington, where 13.21
inches would be needed, and Tennessee, which would require 21.98
inches by Oct. 31, Heim said.
   Only once in 1,000 years can those regions expect that much rain
in the months of August, September and October, he said.
   ``In no prior year,'' going back to 1895, did any of the four
studied regions receive as much rain as they now need in the
three-month period, according to records kept by the center.
   The calculations are based on the detailed Palmer Drought Index,
a system developed to allow scientists to measure shortages of
moisture over the long term.
   The system compares water available from precipitation and from
stored soil moisture with water used by plants, evaporation,
runoff, people and to recharge lakes, reservoirs and dry soil. If
incoming and outgoing water balance, the reading is zero.
   An index reading of minus 4 is termed severe drought, and the
drought is considered to have ended when the Palmer reading gets
back up to minus 0.5, since that is nearly a balance and indicates
that much of the soil moisture has been replenished.
   Severe drought continues to afflict large areas of the nation
despite some recent rains which provided short-term moisture, but
did little to recharge depleted ground water supplies or to improve
the conditions of many rivers and lakes. Palmer Drought Index
readings range as high as minus 7 and minus 8 in some areas.
   In addition to soil moisture problems, restoring normal river
and stream conditions in some regions could take years.
   ``Two to three years of above normal winter precipitation over
the mountainous headwaters of the basin followed by above normal
snowpack runoff for each of the years'' is needed to get the
Missouri River basin back to normal, the National Weather Service
hydrologic office reported.
   For California, the hydrologic office reports, ``one year of
normal winter precipitation followed by normal spring snowpack
runoff'' would do the job.
   The Ohio and lower Mississippi river basins, the agency says,
could be restored to normal flows by ``a series of major low
pressure systems producing at least 8-12 inches of rain over much
of the Ohio River Basin over a two-four week period.''

   Regional disparities in personal incomes
widened last year as strong economic growth continued for coastal
states while states in America's heartland did not fare as well,
the government reports.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that the current economic
expansion is the first in 28 years in which regional differences in
incomes have grown larger rather than narrowing.
   The department said all 10 of the states with the highest
average personal incomes last year were on the nation's coasts:
eight along the Atlantic and two, California and Alaska, on the
Pacific.
   Connecticut ranked No. 1 with residents earning $21,266 for
every man, woman and child last year, an increase of 8.8 percent
over 1986.
   For the entire nation, incomes rose 6 percent to an average of
$15,481 last year, the best showing since a similar 6 percent
increase in 1985. Incomes had risen 5.1 percent in 1986.
   The gain last year kept Americans ahead of inflation, which
climbed 4.4 percent.
   Seven of the 10 states with the lowest incomes were in the
South. Mississippi remained in last place with a per capita income
of $10,292, an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year.
   In contrast to most recovery periods, regional economic
differences have widened since the 1981-82 recession, the report
said.
   The Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions were farther behind the
national income average in 1987 than they were in 1982 at the
depths of the recession, while New England and the Mid-Atlantic
regions were farther ahead.
   ``This has been a somewhat unusual economic expansion,'' said
Rudolph DePass, a Commerce Department analyst. ``Regions like New
England have benefited from rapid growth in high-tech industries
and relatively slow increases in population, while the Southwest
and Rocky Mountain states have been hit by a slump in the oil
industry.''
   New England was the top-earning region in 1982, with incomes 9
percent above the national average. It increased that lead last
year with incomes 20 percent above the national average. The
Mid-Atlantic region, which had incomes 10 percent above the
national average in 1982, had incomes 14 percent higher last year.
And the West had incomes 11 percent higher than the national
average last year, compared with 12 percent higher in 1982.
   By contrast, the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions saw their
incomes fall to 12 percent below the national average in 1987,
compared with 4 percent or less in 1982.
   This drop put these two regions close to the Southeast, which
still came in last with incomes 13 percent below the national
average. The Southeast had been 14 percent below in 1982.
   The Great Lakes region was unchanged, with incomes still 2
percent below the national average in 1987.
   The new figures are likely to supply ammunition for Democratic
charges that the Reagan economic program, while benefiting some
sectors of the economy, have left other areas far behind.
   The Democrats charge that the country has been turned into a
``bicoastal economy'' divided between healthy sections on both
coasts and a problem-plagued heartland afflicted by hard times in
agriculture, oil and declining smokestack industries.
   New Jersey, with an average income of $20,352, ranked second
behind Connecticut. Massachusetts was No. 3, with an average income
of $19,142, followed by Alaska, $18,230, and Maryland, $18,124.
Rounding out the top 10 were New York, California, New Hampshire,
Delaware and Virginia.
   In addition to Mississippi, states with the lowest incomes were
West Virginia, with an average of $11,020; followed by Utah,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Alabama, South Carolina and
Kentucky.
   Thursday's report was based on revised figures that showed
incomes overall grew at a stronger pace than estimated when the
original report was released in April.
   At that time, the government said national per capita incomes
rose 4.8 percent, barely ahead of the 4.4 percent rise in consumer
prices last year.

<HEAD>White House Won't Give Up Documents on Noriega Drug Info</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says it will not
provide information sought by congressional investigators about
alleged drug dealing by Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega
unless the scope of the investigation is reduced.
   The announcement Thursday by President Reagan's chief spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, came as Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis accused the White House of ``stonewalling'' the probe by
the General Accounting Office.
   The inquiry could delve into Republican presidential nominee
George Bush's knowledge of the Noriega case.
   Bush, who is promoting his role in administration anti-drug
efforts, has denied having early knowledge of Noriega's ties to the
drug world or suppressing information about the matter. For years,
Noriega provided intelligence information to the CIA, which Bush
headed in the 1970's.
   Fitzwater, in Santa Barbara while Reagan vacations at his ranch
north of here, said administration officials had ``met with the GAO
in an effort to narrow the request, which GAO declined to do.''
   He said the GAO request ``asks for a broad range of sensitive
intelligence material, information from open law enforcement files,
and material reflecting the deliberative decision-making process of
the executive branch.''
   The administration told the GAO on July 13 that it would need to
complete a legal review before responding to the request, Fitzwater
said.
   ``The Justice Department has just completed that review and has
concluded that the subject matter of the request is beyond GAO's
statutory authority,'' he said. ``The Justice Department has also
concluded that, even were the request within GAO's legal authority,
there are statutory and constitutional objections to providing
various specific categories of information requested.''
   Based on this advice, the White House spokesman said, ``We
cannot participate in the study as currently designed.''
   In Miami, Dukakis said, ``I think the White House does not want
to cooperate because they are embarrassed by this. They should be
embarrassed by this.''
   Nancy R. Kingsbury, who is directing the study for the GAO, an
investigative arm of Congress, said the agency has had disputes
with the executive branch in the past over specific documents, but
it is unusual for the administration to refuse to answer any
questions at all.
   Nicholas Rostow, legal adviser to the National Security Council,
said in a letter to Ms. Kingsbury that the GAO request raised
``important statutory and constitutional issues'' requiring
analysis before the administration could reply.
   The Rostow letter was made public by Rep. Bill Alexander,
D-Ark., who requested the study along with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Rostow's letter was followed by one from State Department
comptroller Roger B. Feldman saying the NSC counsel was ``acting as
the administration's point of contact on this matter'' and adding,
``All executive branch agencies have been instructed by the White
House not to take any action on your request until various legal
issues have been analyzed by the administration.''
   Rostow's office said he was not available to comment.
   Ms. Kingsbury said the study is part of a larger inquiry
examining how information about drug trafficking by foreign
officials has affected U.S. foreign policy decisions.
   Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges earlier this
year by two federal grand juries in Florida. The administration has
sought without success to force Noriega from power in Panama since
that time.
   The GAO is seeking information from the State Department,
Defense Department, Drug Enforcement Administration and National
Security Council.

   The Reagan administration is
applauding ``continuing steps toward democracy'' in Pakistan and
sending Secretary of State George Shultz as the chief U.S. mourner
at the funeral of President Zia ul-Haq.
   President Reagan, vacationing at his ranch north of here,
announced the makeup of the funeral delegation Thursday.
   At the same time, acting with unusual speed for a diplomatic
appointment, he announced that he will nominate veteran foreign
service officer Robert B. Oakley to succeed Arnold Raphel as
ambassador to Pakistan.
   Zia and Raphel were killed Wednesday in an airplane crash near
Lahore, Pakistan. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the chief U.S. military
representative in Pakistan, also was among the 37 people who
perished in the crash.
   In Washington, the State Department declined to speculate about
the cause of the crash.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Dan Howard announced the dispatch of
a team of eight U.S. accident investigators to Pakistan.
   A team of six U.S. military forensic specialists also was being
sent from West Germany to assist the Pakistanis in identifying the
crash victims, Howard said.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, the wife of the new
ambassador-designate, said that Acting President Ghulam Ishak Khan
had reaffirmed Pakistan's pro-United States foreign policy and she
praised the nation's ``continuing steps toward democracy.''
   She applauded Ishaf Khan's indication that elections would be
held in mid-November, as scheduled by Zia, saying, ``These are
sound first steps ... a welcome sign.''
   Oakley, 57, the prospective ambassador, previously has served as
ambassador to Somalia and Zaire and headed the State Department's
Office for Combatting Terrorism. At present, he is senior director
of Middle East, South Asia and North Africa affairs for the
National Security Council.
   He will accompany Shultz to Zia's funeral Saturday in Islamabad.
Others in the delegation will include Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost, State Department Country Director Robert Flatten
and Army Maj. Gen. Robert Jones, who will represent the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   Congressional members of the delegation will include Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., Rep. Bill McCollum Jr., R-Fla., and Rep. Charles
Wilson, D-Texas.
   The White House said the president placed telephone calls
Thursday to Nancy Ely-Raphel, the ambassador's widow; Sara Raphel,
his mother, and Judy Wasson, the general's widow.
   ``The president is expressing condolences and sympathy on behalf
of the nation,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater also said that the president and his wife, Nancy,
along with Vice President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, had
sent messages of condolence to the Zia family.
   Reagan and Bush also sent messages to Ishaq Khan, Fitzwater
said. Reagan told the acting president, ``Let us all rededicate
ourselves to the task of regional peace and reconstruction to which
President Zia dedicated his life. As you carry out your heavy
responsibilities in his absence, please count on the United States
for support.''

<HEAD>There's Help For Small Agriculture Firms That Want To Export
Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small agriculture operators who want a piece
of the action in farm exports can get help from the Agriculture
Department's Foreign Agricultural Service, the department says.
   It's a tricky game to compete with the corporate giants, said
Dugger Harris, coordinator of the minority and small business
program for FAS.
   The agency has a formal agreement with the Small Business
Administration to include small and minority-owned companies in
USDA's export market development programs.
   Most of the assistance offered under the programs is free or
available at nominal costs. Harris said his office is providing
services to about 250 companies and is looking for more.
   ``We want small and minority-owned businesses to know that we
will make available to them the same services the FAS provides to
large exporting businesses,'' he said.
   Harris described the program in the forthcoming September issue
of Foreign Agriculture magazine, a monthly publication of the USDA
agency.
   One of the best ways FAS can help small businesses gain a
foothold in exporting is through participation in international
trade fairs and the business contacts that can be made through
them, he said.
   There is a large demand for the limited exhibit space at trade
fairs, but Harris said FAS has reserved 10 percent of the U.S.
space for small and minority-owned businesses.
   Participation fees are covered by the agency and the Small
Business Administration for those small and minority companies that
are selected to exhibit at the overseas fairs. However, the
companies must bear the costs of travel, lodging and other expenses.
   A firm can qualify for consideration if it has an annual gross
income of $5 million or less and not more than 25 full-time
employees.
   Jerry Ravenell, president of Low Country International Inc. of
Washington, D.C. and Mount Pleasant, S.C., was cited as an example
of how the program works. The company provides export services to
small- and medium-size U.S. companies, ranging from crating and
shipping to serving as overseas agents for U.S. food products.
   Ravenell began four years ago, working with FAS and Small
Business Administration programs, and now ``is gaining a reputation
as a knowledgeable and experienced exporting enterprise,'' the
report said.
   Another example involves beef jerky made by the Apache Meat
Processing Co., Apache, Okla., owned by Robert Rowell, a Kiowa
Indian. Like Ravenell, Rowell also exhibited at a 1984 food trade
show in London. His beef jerky attracted so much attention that
Rowell received an order from Harrod's, the famous London
department store.
   For six months, he supplied Harrod's with beef jerky made with a
special patented sauce.
   Rowell even got a National Minority Business Person of the Year
Award from President Reagan. Unfortunately, Rowell's dream ran
afoul of British suspicion of the water in Oklahoma.
   ``While my jerky met with U.S. government health guidelines, the
English analyzed it and decided that Oklahoma's water, which is
used in making the jerky, wasn't as pure as they would like,''
Rowell said.
   But the report added that Rowell is installing a water
chlorinator at his processing plant and is hoping to get back into
the British jerky market. The Japanese also ``are showing interest
in our dried beef products,'' he said.
   The report said people interested in the USDA program can
contact: Dugger Harris, Coordinator, Minority and Small Business
Programs, High Value Products Division, Foreign Agricultural
Service, Room 4639-South Building, Washington, D.C. 20250-1000.

   China has been given the go-ahead by the
Agriculture Department to buy an additional 2 million metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said Thursday the
wheat will be sold to China at competitive world prices under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under various authorizations, or initiatives, since Jan. 26,
1987, China has bought about 7 million tons of U.S. wheat under the
program. The previous authorization was for 2 million tons on April
5, of which only 10,000 tons remain for use, which is added to the
latest authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big buyer of U.S. wheat under
EEP, with purchases totaling about 13 million tons since April 30,
1987.

   About 355 million bushels of surplus feed
grains owned by the Agriculture Department have been set aside as a
reserve to meet potential demand for emergency livestock use under
the recently passed $3.9 billion Drought Assistance Act.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Thursday the grains are
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. and are being held
in warehouses in 40 states. The grains include 250.4 million
bushels of corn, 79.7 million bushels of sorghum, and 25 million
bushels of barley.
   Myers said additional stocks of CCC feed grains can be made
available if demand from eligible farmers proves greater than
current projections.
   The drought relief measure was signed by President Reagan on
Aug. 11. Myers said final rules as to eligibility requirements for
the grain will be issued in the near future. The program will be
carried out by county offices of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.

   Housing authorities in Boston on Thursday investigated the
deaths of five elderly people, the homeless in Tennessee sought
shelter from the swelter and New York City's mayor decided water
troughs make good horse sense.
   Things weren't much better in other parts of the country as the
nation sweats through one of the hottest summers on record, but
rain and lower temperatures helped a rural community in western
Pennsylvania save its water supply for now.
   At Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, the
mercury climbed to 106 degrees Thursday, the highest reading in the
steamy state. Raleigh tied its all-time high of July 23, 1952, as
the mercury climbed to 105 degrees, the National Weather Service
said.
   Also setting heat records for the date were Charlotte, N.C.,
where 101 degrees broke a 1956 record of 99, and Lynchburg, Va.,
where 98 broke a 97-degree mark set in 1914.
   But a front stretching central Iowa across the Ohio Valley and
into the Appalachians brought relief _ and thunderstorms _ to many
cities north of it, with temperatures in the 70s.
   A 75-year-old Boston woman died of heart failure Monday,
bringing to five the number of residents at a housing project who
have died during 10 days of high temperatures. Four of the
residents lived on the same floor.
   The woman earlier became ill in her room on the top floor of the
eight-story building. Three other top-floor residents and a man who
lived on the floor below have died since Aug. 4, a period in which
temperatures soared into the 90s.
   ``It's quite obvious someone has to look at it and see why that
floor must have been so hot,'' said Massachusetts Medical Examiner
Bryan Blackbourne.
   Boston Housing Authority officials Thursday found all systems
functional at the 18-year-old building, said spokesman Bill Wright.
The 12 exhaust fans on the roof were working, and temperatures in
the halls on each floor were only a few degrees apart, he said.
   The heat in Kentucky, where it reached 103 degrees in Paducah,
breaking the 1954 mark of 102, forced some school systems to put
off the start of classes.
   ``I think the heat index (measuring the combined effects of heat
and humidity) is hotter than I can ever remember it,'' said Darvin
Estes, school superintendent in Bath County, where opening day was
postponed from Wednesday to Monday.
   Southern Illinois also remained in the heat wave's grip as the
northern part of the state got relief from a cold front that
brought thunderstorms and hail. By 2 p.m., Peoria reported the
mercury had soared to 101 degrees; in contrast, Chicago had a
relatively mild 85 degrees.
   Two homeless shelters in Nashville, Tenn., where temperatures
hovered around 100 degrees all week, stayed open all day to provide
a cool spot.
   ``It's a terrible problem. There's really nowhere for these
people to go,'' said Winnie McKenzie, director of St. Patrick's
Shelter. ``I've been keeping our people in during the day. I can't
put them out with babies and all.''
   The Nashville Union Rescue Mission also opened its
air-conditioned chapel during the day.
   In New York City, the collapse earlier this week of a carriage
horse working in 90-degree-plus weather created a public furor and
prompted Mayor Edward I. Koch to announce some changes.
   Koch said Thursday the city will provide more watering holes in
Central Park, move a horse ambulance there and provide shade in hot
weather. He also called for review of a regulation that requires
horses to return to the stable when the temperature hits 90 degrees.
   The changes, he said ``make good old-fashioned horse sense.''
   Rain and lower temperatures enabled Tidioute, Pa., to save its
public water supply.
   ``We don't know how long it's going to last. Another hot day and
we'll be right back where we were,'' said Karen Bajorek, borough
secretary.
   Workers installed a pump to draw water from a well that was
drilled in 1985 but left unused because of high concentrations of
minerals, including iron that leaves rust-colored stains and sodium
that has been linked to high blood pressure.
   ``So people on a no-salt diet will not be able to drink it, and
because of the high iron content, it might stain their sinks and
their clothes,'' Ms. Bajorek said.
   Despite the misery, some people have come up with creative ways
of beating the heat.
   H.M. Hines, who owns Home Ice and Coal Co. in Raleigh, said it
was hot enough that some people had asked him to dump blocks of ice
into their swimming pools.
   ``But it's not a good idea,'' Hines said.``Somebody jumps in and
hits that 300-pound block of ice, it's dangerous.''

that State Department officials say could tarnish Najibullah's
image.
   The Afghan ruler and his brother, Saddiqullah Rahi, were said to
have been at odds for years. Saddiqullah was under death threat and
was protected for months by an anti-government faction that then
spirited him out of Afghanistan to Pakistan, said two U.S.
officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   The two brothers sometimes go by shorter names. Najibullah is
also known as Najib, and Saddiqullah as Saddiq.
   Saddiqullah, 37, his wife, Soraya, and their two young sons
reached the United States on Wednesday from Frankfurt, West
Germany, and have been given sanctuary, the officials said.
   ``He was accepted in this country as a refugee,'' an official
told The Associated Press. ``No special deals were made, but the
processing was expedited. Elaborate security precautions have been
taken.''
   Saddiqullah, who was described as an intellectual, apparently
joined the forces of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the rebel field commander
who has led the fight against Afghan troops and Soviet forces in
the strategic Panjshir valley.
   He also was believed to have joined the Jamiat-i-Islami party,
one of the largest opposition groups.
   Some years ago, a U.S. official said, Saddiqullah served as
Afghanistan's banking representative in Hamburg, West Germany. He
broke with his brother, and claimed he was kidnapped, taken to East
Germany and forced back to Afghanistan, the official said.
   ``It certainly doesn't do anything for the image of the leader
of Afghanistan for his brother, who had a privileged position, to
defect,'' the official said.
   Meanwhile, the State Department, expressing satisfaction with
the pace of the Soviet troop pullout from Afghanistan, urged Moscow
on Thursday to withdraw all remaining soldiers by year's end _ six
weeks before the deadline set by the Geneva accords.
   ``We see no reason why the Soviets cannot meet their
often-stated goal of completing the withdrawal by the end of 1988 _
nine years to the month from their invasion,'' the department said
in a statement.
   ``The Soviet withdrawal is indispensable to the ability of the
Afghan people to determine their own future and of the Afghan
refugees to return home in safety and honor,'' it said.
   The Geneva accords signed last April call for completing the
Soviet army's pullout by Feb. 15. Half the troops were to have been
removed by last Monday, a deadline the State Department said the
Soviets met.
   ``The vast majority of Afghanistan is now free of Soviet
troops,'' the statement said. ``Soviet combat units remain deployed
in only two corridors in northern Afghanistan. The bulk of Soviet
troops remaining in that country are in the Kabul area and along
the road heading north from Kabul to Termez, the Soviet border
town.''
   On Wednesday, after Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq was
killed in an air crash, U.S. and Soviet diplomats held an
unannounced meeting in Washington. Zia had played a leading role in
arranging the Afghan troop withdrawal.
   A U.S. official, who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified, said the Soviets assured the Americans that Zia's death
would not affect the withdrawal.

<HEAD>Texas Air Accuses United, American of Illegal Acts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Texas Air Corp. has accused American and
United airlines of gaining hundreds of millions of dollars through
illegal use of their reservations systems.
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline group, charged in a
complaint filed Thursday with the Department of Transportation that
United and American were deliberately misleading travel agents
using their computerized reservations systems.
   By giving agents unreliable information about rivals' flights,
American and United have discouraged the agents from booking
passengers on airlines other than theirs, the complaint said.
   ``This is the first time anyone has documented how American and
United use the power of technology to pick the pockets of
consumers,'' said Bill Diffenderffer, vice president and general
counsel of System One, which runs Texas Air's computerized
reservations system.
   The complaint was made in the names of System One and Texas
Air's two main carriers, Continental and Eastern.
   American and United both denied the charges, saying past
attempts by Texas Air to challenge the legality of their
computerized reservations systems had failed.
   ``This effort by Texas Air is unworthy of serious attention,''
said Charles Novak, a United spokesman in Chicago. He said Texas
Air had been unsuccessful in past lawsuits against the United
computerized reservations system.
   Novak accused Texas Air of trying to ``use the courts, the
Congress and federal agencies ... to gain for itself business that
(United) has secured through hard work, large investments and
innovation.''
   Jim Brown, an American spokesman, said Texas Air's charges were
without foundation.
   The inch-thick Texas Air complaint said United's computerized
reservations system, called Apollo, and American's, known as Sabre,
are supposed to allow travel agents to make seat reservations and
issue boarding passes reliably for flights on other airlines.
   Instead, Sabre and Apollo are designed deliberately not to
provide consistently reliable information about other carriers, the
Texas Air complaint said. Because of the unreliability, travel
agents are discouraged from booking flights on airlines other than
American and United, Texas Air contended.
   The Houston-based Texas Air claimed United and American had
violated Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act, which prohibits
unfair or deceptive methods of airline competition.
   The complaint includes a copy of what Texas Air called an
internal American memo dated July 15, 1980, expressing concern that
United's Sabre system might be giving United an edge.
   The memo says that if American can determine that United's
computerized system gives it ``greater market preferences'' than
does American's system, ``either through conscious bias or by
making it inconvenient to book carriers other than United, we must
find a way to skew the usage rates of Sabre in similar ways.''
   The complaint also accused United and American of preventing
travel agents from obtaining competing computerized reservations
systems, such as Texas Air's System One.
   Texas Air contends in a 20-city survey included in the complaint
that American's system diverted to American $7.1 million in
additional passenger revenue from flights serving Los Angeles in
May 1988. Similarly, United diverted $8.7 million on the same
routes in that period, the complaint alleges.
   It said such diversions had totaled hundreds of millions of
dollars in recent years, but it gave no exact figures.

   Rolling Stone magazine, long the definitive word
on rock 'n' roll, has chosen the 100 best singles of the past
quarter-century, and the magazine's name is high on the list.
   ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones topped
the list, followed by Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling Stone.'' The
Beatles were third with ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' and its flip
side, ``I Saw Her Standing There.''
   The Rolling Stones hit the list three more times: at No. 27 with
``Honky Tonk Women''; at No. 68 with ``Jumpin' Jack Flash''; and at
No. 74 with ``Brown Sugar.''
   ``I actually didn't want it to be a single,'' said Keith
Richards, who invented the buzzing guitar riff for
``Satisfaction.'' He told Rolling Stone: ``I thought it was just
filler.''
   Richards said he wrote the guitar line in a motel in Clearwater,
Fla., during the band's U.S. tour in 1965.
   ``Like a Rolling Stone'' is Dylan's only recording in the top
100, though his ``All Along the Watchtower'' ranked 65th in the
version recorded by Jimi Hendrix and ``Mr. Tambourine Man,''
covered by The Byrds, was No. 86.
   ``Like a Rolling Stone'' broke through the three-minute format
of most 45s and set the rock world on the road to free-form FM.
   Unlike Richards, Dylan never suffered doubts about the quality
of his song. ``The first two lines which rhymed `kiddin' you' with
`didn't you' just about knocked me out; and later on, when I got to
the jugglers and the chrome horse and the princess on the steeple,
it all just about got to be too much,'' he said in a statement
given to the magazine.
   The Beatles also appear at No. 29 with ``Hey Jude''; No. 48 with
``Strawberry Fields Forever'' backed by ``Penny Lane''; and at No.
53 with ``Help!'' John Lennon's ``Imagine'' is No. 44 and his
``Instant Karma'' No. 79.
   The magazine, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year,
said it could easily have compiled a list of 100 great 45 rpm
recordings from the 1950s. However, it chose to go back to 1963 as
``a time of revitalization and reinvention in rock 'n' roll.''
   The highest-rated song from 1963 is ``Louie Louie,'' the
unintelligble garage-rock hit by the Kingsmen of Portland, Ore.
Other 1963 hits are ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' by the Crystals (No. 35) and
``Be My Baby'' by the Ronettes (No. 38), both produced by Phil
Spector.
   Rolling Stone's list was compiled by 25 rock critics and is in
the Sept. 8 edition, which goes on sale Tuesday.
   The rest of the Top 10:
   4. Marvin Gaye, ``I Heard it Through the Grapevine.''
   5. The Jackson Five, ``I Want You Back.''
   6. Aretha Franklin, ``Respect.''
   7. Otis Redding, ``The Dock of the Bay.''
   8. Creedence Clearwater Revival, ``Fortunate Son.''
   9. Bruce Springsteen, ``Born to Run.''
   10. The Supremes, ``Stop! in the Name of Love.''
   Springsteen's ``Born to Run,'' recorded in 1975, is the most
recent song in the Rolling Stone top 10.
   The 25 rock critics, including Rolling Stone editor and
publisher Jann Wenner, paid little homage to the king of rock 'n'
roll, Elvis Presley, putting his ``Suspicious Minds'' at No. 47.
   Of course, Presley's best recordings were mostly before 1963. So
were Chuck Berry's, whose later singles didn't make the list.
   There's more soft rock than hard rock _ hard rock always has
done better with fans than critics. Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way''
is No. 61, and Led Zeppelin's ``Whole Lotta Love'' is No. 96.
   The soft rock is mostly by groups, not individuals, and most of
the groups no longer exist: the Eagles, the Mamas and the Papas,
Buffalo Springfield, Fleetwood Mac, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,
the Byrds and Lovin' Spoonful.
   Among those missing from the list are The Band, the Carpenters,
Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Jim Croce, Boz Skaggs, Gordon
Lightfoot, the Monkees, Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, Madonna,
Carly Simon, the Doobie Brothers and Cher, with or without Sonny.
   Paul Simon, who was in 71st place with the Simon and Garfunkel
hit ``Bridge Over Troubled Water,'' didn't place as a solo artist.
Neither did Tina Turner, who was No. 30 with ex-husband Ike Turner
with ``River Deep, Mountain High.''

   Republican delegates fretted Thursday over
Dan Quayle's decision to join the National Guard when the Vietnam
war was raging, but many shrugged it off and some groused about a
news media ``witch hunt.''
   Several said they would have done the same themselves had they
been eligible for the military draft during the conflict. National
Guard units were rarely activated for Vietnam duty.
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley of Maryland said, ``I don't like the
sound of it,'' She said Quayle, George Bush's choice as a running
mate, had denied Wednesday that anyone used influence to help him
get into the Guard in 1969.
   Bentley at first suggested that Quayle had only two choices:
either admit ``he was a liar or he can withdraw from the race.''
But later she backed off, saying the issue was ``dead'' and had
been based on ``inaccurate news reports.''
   Rep. Bob Dornan, a staunch conservative and co-chairman of the
Bush campaign in California, said, ``It requires a Checkers-like
speech, and he must do _ must do it _ quickly, before this gets out
of hand.''
   George Walker Bush Jr., the vice president's eldest son, called
the flap ``ridiculous'' and said he joined the National Guard, too,
in 1968.
   ``It was available and I went,'' said Bush, 42, who was a pilot
in the Guard. ``I thought it was service to my country and I'm
proud of my time in the National Guard.'
   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said, ``If Dan can withstand the next two
weeks, which will be brutal, he'll be vice president of the United
States.''
   ``What's the big deal?' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire. ``He pulled some strings to serve his country. He could
have gone to Canada.''
   The questions through the state delegation meetings Thursday
morning, hours before the climactic night of the Republican
National Convention.
   Samuel Atkins, 43, a Watkinsville, Ga., lawyer, said the ``baby
boomers will understand, but the older generation may hold it
against him.''
   Gordon Pederson of Wall, S.D., a retired U.S. Army lieutenant
colonel, said: ``I was in three wars and a riot and see nothing
wrong with that. It was just a legal option. ... It just burns me
up because somebody is looking for headlines.''
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Navy fighter pilot who spent 5{
years in a Hanoi prison, said, ``Service in the National Guard is
an honorable profession.''
   ``If, however, there is clear evidence that the process may have
been manipulated to give some kind of special preference, then I
think it's a problem ... that needs to be resolved,'' he said.
   T.J. Bailey of Bailey, Ore., the state GOP chairman and a
Vietnam veteran, said: ``I truly do not resent Dan Quayle for not
having gone. It is a way a number of my lifelong friends opted. We
have to examine the sanity and wisdom of people who resent him for
not being shot at.''
   Noble Cody, a businessman from Cookeville, Tenn., said: ``If I
had a son that age and knowing what I do now about that war, I'd do
everything I could to keep him out of it.''
   Bob Naylor, the California state GOP chairman and a Vietnam
veteran, said Quayle did what ``anyone in his position would do at
that time.''
   Delegate Tom Adam of Pierre, S.D., said, ``I think that's just a
witch hunt.''
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Jerry Curry, a congressional candidate
from Virginia Beach, Va., who served two tours in Vietnam, said,
``The idea that anybody who serves in the National Guard or
Reserves should be called a draft dodger because their unit did not
get activated and sent off to war is disgusting.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska said Quayle should ``get his uniform
pictures and put them out everywhere. It's a plus, not a negative.''
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said suggesting that joining the National
Guard ``was almost the same as going to Canada'' made him ``the
fightingest mad that I've been in a long time.''
   Jerry Prevo of Anchorage, chairman of the Alaska delegation,
said, ``People make mistakes when they're young.''
   Tom Cole, chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party, called it
``Quayle-bashing. I think it's kind of a cheap shot and a low
blow.''

<TEXT>
   A state Supreme Court ruling that limits
the ability of unmarried people to sue for emotional distress when
a live-in companion is killed shows the court is out of touch with
the times, says a lawyer in the case.
   ``We all know that in this society no one frowns on people who
are not married living together,'' said Michael Robins, a lawyer
for Richard Elden, who filed suit over a fatal 1982 crash in
Pasadena.
   ``It's a new world and the Supreme Court just hasn't caught up
with it,'' Robins said.
   In a 6-1 decision Thursday, the court cited ``the state's
interest in promoting marriage'' in saying that Elden, who saw his
lover fatally injured in a car crash, cannot sue the other driver
for emotional distress and loss of companinship.
   The ruling prevents a member of an unmarried couple, whether
heterosexual or homosexual, from suing for emotional distress
suffered from seeing the other partner injured. Such suits can be
filed by a spouse, a parent, a child or other close relative.
   Justice Stanley Mosk, writing for the majority, said allowing a
suit by a lover ``would impose a difficult burden on the courts,''
which would have to decide whether the relationship was ``stable
and significant'' and contained ``the emotional attachments of the
family relationship.''
   Such an inquiry would also threaten a ``massive intrusion into
the private life of the partners,'' Mosk said.
   The court also said a suit for ``loss of consortium,'' which
refers to love, companionship, emotional support and sexual
relations denied by loss of a partner, can be filed only by a
spouse.
   In dissent, Justice Allen Broussard said there was no legal or
social reason to prevent one member of a couple living together to
sue for emotional damage caused by seeing the other partner injured.
   Such emotional injuries are to be expected, ``given the
widespread reality and acceptance of unmarried cohabitation,''
Broussard said.
   The ruling did not affect a 1976 ``palimony'' decision involving
actor Lee Marvin, in which the court led the nation in establishing
property rights of married couples by allowing one member of an
unmarried couple to bind the other to an implied promise of
financial support.
   Patrick Mesisca, a lawyer for Robert Sheldon, the other driver
in the case, said allowing a suit by a member of an unmarried
couple ``could have opened up a Pandora's box of litigation'' that
``could include people of the same sex, could include roommates,
could include people who have close personal friendships.''
   Elden was injured in a December 1982 crash in Pasadena that
killed Linda Ebeling, the woman he lived with. His suit said
Sheldon had run a red light and hit their car broadside.
   Elden settled the suit over his personal injuries, but his
attempt to collect damages from Sheldon for emotional distress and
loss of consortium was dismissed by Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge George Xanthos. A state appeals court upheld that decision.
   Those rulings, and Thursday's Supreme Court decision, rejected
rulings by a few appellate courts allowing suits by one member of a
couple who claimed a ``stable, significant relationship''
equivalent to marriage.

   Here is a chronology of the two-day
hostage-taking drama, based on reports from police and witnesses.
All times are local:

<HEAD>TUESDAY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   8 a.m. _ Two armed robbers rush the Gladbeck branch of Deutsche
Bank and barricade themselves in the building, taking hostage a
34-year-old cashier and a 23-year-old female assistant.
   8 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. _ Hundreds of police surround the bank and
negotiators try to persuade the bandits to release the hostages,

but no one is injured. Police give the the bandits 300,000 marks
(about $160,000) and the key to the bank's main safe. The robbers

<HEAD>Fresh Water Supplies Of Gulf Arabs Shrinking, Raising Concerns</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil remains in good supply, but fresh
water is running low in the six Arab nations on the Persian Gulf.
United Nations experts are concerned.
   The Dammam aquifer, running like an umbilical cord under the six
nations, provides an estimated one-third of their overall water.
But with all six states sucking up the water faster than nature can
put it back, the experts predict a future far more arid than it is
now.
   ``Man can live without food for two to three months, but he
would die without water for two to three days,'' said Ahmed Adel
Orabi, deputy director of the regional U.N. Environmental Program,
which is based in Bahrain, a Gulf island.
   ``If extraction continues to exceed recharge, the Dammam aquifer
can dry up within 10 to 50 years,'' he said. ``If well-exploited,
it can last forever.''
   Water resources are a problem throughout the Middle East: riots
broke out in Sudan in July over fluctuations in the water supply;
Libya is expecting to invest $25 billion in an underground river
system; some analysts see a danger of wars in the future over the
area's water resources.
   The Dammam aquifer stretches the length of the western coastline
of the Persian Gulf, from Kuwait in the north through Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
   The reservoir, used mostly for agriculture, is the source of the
artesian wells that allowed oases to flourish along the coast for
hundreds of years.
   But oil wealth brought new demands on the water supply as
economies expanded.
   Saudi Arabia has a daily desalinized water flow of 588 million
gallons for a population of less than 12 million. With its vast oil
reserves, it can afford it.
   But states like Bahrain still have to rely on nature, and
officials here view the depletion of the Dammam aquifer with alarm.
Bahrain gets 50 percent of its water from the underground system.
   ``Water has been stored in the reservoir over millions of years.
... Over the past 10 to 15 years, it is being bled more than can be
compensated,'' said Jamil Al Alawi, Bahrain's assistant
undersecretary for power and water affairs.
   Bahrain's finances, battered by soft oil prices, have enabled it
to build only two desalinization plants. A third, a gift from Saudi
Arabia, has been delayed.
   Desalinization plants make it unlikely that anyone in the area
will go thirsty. But the cost of the refined water is prohibitive
for farm irrigation. This means that water from the aquifer could
be the key to agricultural and economic development.
   ``Desalinization plants complement the reservoir, they are good
for drinking purposes, but it is the reservoir that helps vital
development going,'' said Orabi. ``There can be no food security
without water security.''
   Area leaders call for nationwide prayers when the rains do not
come in the winter, while newspaper and television campaigns skewer
careless users.
   Television programs remind Bahrainis that only 50 years ago
water used to be hauled in from the ``kawkabs'' _ the sweet-water
springs gushing from the sea.
   ``Water is our most precious source of life. When it's gone, so
are we,'' said another TV program.
   This year's rains have been bountiful, so much so that tomato
growers on Bahrain nearly lost their crops.
   But rains are unpredictable.
   The U.N. Environmental Program hopes to come up with a
comprehensive plan within two years for conserving the Damman
aquifer, and an international agreement might have to be worked out
to distribute the water among the six nations.
   The U.N. plan will also suggest alternative irrigation sources,
such as recycling sewer water. It also will seek to re-educate
farmers on cutting the amount of water used on their fields.
   Orabi said it is a false concept that land in desert areas
requires more water for irrigation.
   Al-Alawi estimated that Bahrain's population was growing at the
rate of 5 percent to 10 percent annually, and coupled with a rising
standard of living, water consumption reached a peak of 61 million
gallons a day last year. It is expected to hit 65 million this
summer. Its desalinization plants produce a little over half that.
   Until greater production and conservation redress the situation,
Bahrain would have to pump 30 million gallons a day from the Dammam
aquifer to meet demand.
   Bahrain sits at the edge of the aquifer, and drawing too much
water too fast could allow seawater to seep in, Al-Alawi said. Too
much salinity in artesian wells is irreversible.
   ``This year and the coming years the situation is critical,
(but) I won't call it dangerous,'' he said.

   Delegates of South Korea and North Korea
met Friday for the first time in more than 2{ years to discuss
easing their bitter 40-year rivalry, but they disagreed on the
North's demand to be a co-host of the Summer Olympics.
   The two sides adjourned without reaching any agreement after
talking for almost three hours on the format and agenda for
full-scale parliamentary talks. They agreed to a second meeting
Saturday.
   The talks between five lawmakers from each side opened with
chief North Korean delegate Chon Kum Chol insisting the communist
North act as co-host at the Games and calling for a non-aggression
pact between the two Koreas.
   The Olympics, he said, were a ``serious political problem which
will decide the destiny of the Korean people.''
   Chief South Korean delegate Park Joon-kyu, in his opening
speech, said the only solution was for the North to take part in
the Olympics in Seoul, which begin Sept. 17. He made no reference
to co-hosting the Games with North Korea.
   ``The only way for the two sides to cooperate with each other in
the cause of the 24th Olympiad is for your athletes to take part in
the Seoul Games together with our athletes,'' he told North Korean
delegates.
   The North is demanding to co-host the Olympics to stave off what
might be viewed as a major political defeat. Both sides claim to be
the sole legitimate government of Korea, and the South sees its
selection to host the Olympics as international recognition of its
claim.
   Park said the South would keep the door open until the last
moment for the North to take part, but he noted that the deadline
for entries was Sept. 2.
   ``How regretful it would be if our nation, already suffering
from the division of the homeland, must see even the Olympics cause
a split between Seoul and Pyongyang,'' he said.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics if it is not
allowed to co-host the Games.
   The International Olympic Committee has said repeatedly North
Korean cannot co-host because the Games are awarded to a single
city. South Korean authorities fear the North may use terrorism to
try to disrupt the Olympics.
   The two Koreas, technically still at war, are archenemies with
hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile border in
a state of constant tension.
   The two sides have no relations. The border is sealed, and the
two countries maintain no direct transportation or communications
links except for a single hotline.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and U.S.
forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II. Separate republics were declared in 1948. North Korea invaded
the South in 1950, beginning the Korean War that ended in stalemate
three years later.
   The South has evolved into a major economic power and started to
move toward full democracy. The North has remained one of the most
isolated and authoritarian nations in the world.
   Friday's meeting at the truce city in Panmunjom represented the
first meeting between the two sides since the last peace talks
collapsed in January 1986.
   All the North Korean delegates at Friday's sesssion were drawn
from the official rubber-stamp Supreme Peoples' Assembly. The South
Korean delegation consisted of two government party members of the
National Assembly and a legislator from each of the three main
opposition parties.
   While stressing the importance of the Olympics, the North Korean
delegation placed it second on its list of priorities, putting the
need for a non-aggression pact first.
   South Korean observers said it could be a sign the North
realized it could not co-host the Olympics and was already looking
beyond the Games.
   The two sides also remained far apart on the agenda for later
full-scale talks. North Korea wants to discuss a non-aggression
pact and the Olympics. The South said it wants much broader talks
covering a range of social, political, and economic issues.
   The North also continued to insist on participation of the full
parliaments of both sides, in addition to representatives of social
and cultural groups.
   South Korea insisted on smaller delegations.
   Chon said the first full-scale meeting should be held Aug. 26 in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. He said any final agreement
would be put to a vote of the two assemblies.

   Shifting wind abruptly fanned a week-old
fire in the mountains on the outskirts of Helena, quadrupling the
blaze to 20,000 acres, burning 10 houses and cabins and forcing
dozens of residents to flee, authorities said Thursday.
   ``When I saw that that wall of flame, all I wanted to do was get
out,'' said Carol Williams, one of at least 55 people ordered from
their homes late Wednesday night in a mountain area 15 miles south
of Helena.
   Authorities had warned an additional 400 to 500 people in the
nearby Saddle Mountain subdivision, where large wooded lots are
several hundred yards from each other, they might have to evacuate.
But Thursday's winds turned the flames away from the area, said Art
Howell of the Interagency Fire Dispatch Center.
   About 40 people living in the Elkhorn Mountains south of here
remained out of their homes Thursday afternoon.
   The Warm Springs blaze began when a four-wheel-drive vehicle
caught fire Aug. 9. Wind changed the fire's dirction Wednesday
evening from the east to the north, and flames quickly burned a
3-mile-wide swath, fire officials said. Four houses and six summer
cabins were burned, said fire information officer Bob Krepps.
   The fire grew to 17,000 acres by Thursday morning, up from about
5,000 acres the day before. By Thursday afternoon, it was estimated
at 20,000 acres. Officials had no estimate of when the fire might
be contained.
   ``The fire burned heavily all through the night,'' said Anne
Jeffery, a fire information officer.
   ``You could hear the fire coming,'' said Barbara Duffy, whose
cabin and herd of 30 cows were destroyed by flames.
   ``It sounded like a train,'' she said. ``Then when we came out
of the garage, we saw this fireball coming at us through the trees.
It was the strangest feeling.''
   Gov. Ted Schwinden flew in a helicopter over the fire and said
he feared it would get worse. ``The wind has come up, the humidity
is down, the temperature is up and we still have a serious fire
situation,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in Montana, firefighters battled blazes covering more
than 15,000 acres, while fires also continued at Yellowstone Park
in Wyoming and other parts of the West.
   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from at least 15 states were battling
the blaze near Helena, said Bobb Lawrence, a fire foreman in the
Department of State Lands. Firefighting costs had reached $1.5
million.
   Assisting were three airplanes dropping fire retardant, 10
helicopters, 12 bulldozers, at least 25 pumper trucks and six water
supply trucks. The Montana National Guard was not activated, but 20
guard volunteers were helping fight the fire, and guard trucks and
helicopters were being used.
   Red Cross spokesman Gary Yundt said check-in stations at the
east and west edges of the fire had registered about 55 evacuees,
including 15 who left their homes near the community of Winston at
the fire's east edge.
   Evacuees said they spent much of the night moving personal
belongings, farm equipment and vehicles from their homes to safer
areas.
   ``I want to go up there again,'' Williams said. ``I keep
thinking of all the things I want to get.''
   Leon Sperry, her neighbor, lamented: ``We have some of the most
beautiful views. Now look at it _ snags.''
   Hundreds of miles away in southeastern Montana, about 1,000
firefighters Thursday held three fires totaling more than 13,500
acres at bay in grass and timberlands around Lame Deer, but an
approaching weather front was viewed as a major threat.
   ``We're watching the lightning in the distance right now,'' fire
information officer Ron Smith said Thursday night.
   The fires were mostly surrounded by fire lines Thursday night,
and crews were poised to attack any new wind-caused flareups or new
fires caused by lightning, he said.
   ``Our humidity is so low that they say a spot (fire) could go to
65 acres in 30 minutes. I guess that's as close to spontaneous
combustion as you can get,'' said Dave McMorran, another spokesman.
   Wind expanded the Lost Canyon Fire in north-central Montana
overnight, driving the flames across an additional 1,800 acres for
a total of 4,800, officials said.
   In Wyoming, Yellowstone officials said most areas of the park
were open Thursday, but fallen trees from the 69,000-acre North
Fork fire forced officials to once again put that area off-limits.
   The fire is among several involving more than 272,000 acres of
the nation's oldest park.
   In Southern California's San Jacinto Mountains, firefighters
struggled against steep, inaccessible terrain as they battled an
arson fire that had consumed 1,000 acres of brush and timber. The
fire, about 95 miles east of Los Angeles, was about 40 percent
contained Thursday but continued to burn, threatening the Twin
Pines Boys Camp near Idylwild.
   In Idaho, two expert ``hotshot'' fire crews remained on the
260-acre Ladder Creek fire in the Frank Church River of No Return
Wilderness, working to complete a break line in front of the
stubborn backcountry blaze.
   Two fires in northern Utah, the 600-acre Sawmill No. 2fire and
the 70-acre Hogsback fire, were reported under control Thursday.

   Even as he became the Republican vice
presidential nominee Thursday, Dan Quayle was mired in controversy
after it was disclosed that a family connection helped him join the
National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War.
   Top aides to presidential nominee George Bush met during the day
to discuss ways to quell the furor, as campaign spokeswoman Alixe
Glen declared, ``Not a single thought is being given to changing
the ticket.''
   Criticism heard outside the Superdome was weighed against
delegates' enthusiastic demonstrations inside the hall. Quayle
added several lines to his acceptance speech to make his defiant
stand clear and the crowd erupted in applause.
   ``As a young man, I served six years in the National Guard. And,
like the millions of Americans who have served in the Guard...I am
proud of it,'' Quayle said.
   ``I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side,'' Bush told the
delegates as he accepted the top spot on the ticket.
   What should have been a triumphant day for the second-term
Indiana senator was instead full of hurried meetings and wild
rumors as the story of his military service unfolded.
   Some Republicans suggested Quayle's nomination might have been a
mistake.
   ``I don't like the fact that Quayle denied yesterday that
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had,''
said Rep. Helen Bentley, chairman of the Bush campaign in Maryland.
``Quayle can do one of two things: admit this and that he was a
liar _ or he can withdraw from the race.''
   She backed off later, however, saying the issue was ``dead'' and
based on ``inaccurate news reports.''
   Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa voiced similar views: ``If appropriate
information was sought and appropriate information wasn't
forthcoming, then if I were George Bush I'd reserve the right to
reconsider.''
   Quayle refused to answer questions about the uproar.
   ``I answered many questions last night,'' Quayle told reporters
as he entered the convention hall. ``I'm going to continue to
answer questions you raise about me, about issues, about anything
through this campaign.
   ``Tonight is George Bush's night. And in deference to George
Bush, I'm not going to get into all the details. I'll be around
tomorrow. I'll be around the next day to answer your questions,''
he added.
   Bush aides met during the day to hash out the campaign's
reaction to the controversy.
   ``We have chased down every single rumor. We haven't been able
to substantiate one single rumor,'' Bush press secretary Sheila
Tate said after a three-hour afternoon meeting.
   Asked if the campaign thought the matter had been put to rest,
Tate said, ``I believe so.''
   Others agreed.
   ``It's ridiculous to talk of dropping him from the ticket over
something like this,'' said Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, a Vietnam
veteran. ``I know a lot of people whose families made calls to get
them into the Guard or the military. ... Dan Quayle volunteered.''
   The Indiana senator said Wednesday that he didn't know whether
family connections had been used to get him into the National Guard
and that suggestions that he joined to avoid the draft were ``a
cheap shot.'' A day later, he said through a spokesman that calls
``may have been made.''
   The Indianapolis News, a newspaper owned by Quayle's family,
reported Thursday that its former managing editor Wendell C.
Phillippi had interceded with Guard officials on Quayle's behalf.
Phillippi was a former commander of the Indiana National Guard and
worked for Quayle's grandfather at the newspaper. Later Phillippi
said he made only one call on Quayle's behalf.
   ``I did recommend Danny Quayle for the National Guard,''
Phillippi said. ``I just called the military department and said,
`Here's a good man, you ought to take him.' ... It was just as I
have done for many young men over many years. ... I was just a peon
calling the military department. I had no power.''
   There was some disagreement over whether there were long waiting
lists to get into the National Guard in Indiana _ as in other
states.
   John S. Anderson, adjutant general prior to 1969, said one did
exist, but John N. Owens, who followed Anderson in the job, said
Indiana units ``had vacancies galore.''
   Quayle, a hard-liner on defense matters, joined the National
Guard in 1969, when he had graduated from college and thus lost his
student deferment from the draft. Quayle was a private first class
in the Guard, serving as a writer in a public information unit
until 1975.
   Few guard units were activated and sent to Vietnam, and many
young men sought to join the guard to avoid being drafted and sent
to Vietnam. Of the more than 58,000 American casualties in the
Vietnam war, 97 were Guardsmen in mobilized units.
   Phillippi said Quayle inquired as to whether he might be sent to
Vietnam as part of a Guard unit.
   The issue of how he got into the Guard was raised during the
screening process run by the Bush campaign on all possible running
mates, said Bush aide Robert Teeter.
   ``The question was, I believe, was there any pull or some
influence in some way for him to get into the National Guard. My
impression is the answer is absolutely not,'' said Teeter. ``He, at
some point said, `I simply applied, like anyone else.''' said
Teeter.
   While the Bush campaign tried to play down the controversy,
other Republicans said it could be a continuing problem for the GOP
ticket.
   ``Let's face it, the question is whether a rich kid's family got
him into the Guard when other people were getting drafted,'' said
John DeCamp, a Vietnam veteran and Republican delegate. ``Some of
them like me got shot at a lot and a great many of them just plain
got shot and killed.''
   Ed Rollins, former campaign manager for Ronald Reagan, said if
Quayle misled the campaign, Bush would have ``a right to withdraw
the nomination. You cut your losses and do not bleed to death.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming said questions about Quayle's
military service were ``a bunch of crap. There are about 10 million
people in the National Guard who should be offended by all of
this.''
   But Rep. Bob Dornan of California, a hard-line conservative and
longtime Bush supporter, said Quayle must explain himself, much as
Richard Nixon did in 1952 to defuse reports of financial
impropriety.
   ``It requires a Checkers-like speech, and he must do it _ must
do it _ quickly, before this gets out of hand,'' Dornan said.

   Sure, there's the thrill of the presidential
race or the upcoming Olympics. But there's nothing quite like
cheering on thousands of rubber duckies, say devotees of an unusual
competition.
   About 15,000 of the fake fowl are expected to compete in a
charity race on the Illinois River on Sunday. People will pay $5 to
adopt a duckie in hopes that the tiny toy wearing their number will
win them an island vacation.
   ``It's awesome,'' said Myrna Parker, executive secretary of the
Alberta Heart and Stroke Foundation in Calgary, which rents its
150,000 ducks to other charitable groups. ``It's a sea of yellow.
Everyone yells at their duckies, they give them names.''
   ``They're like the ones you play with in the bathtub. They're
just adorable,'' added Darla Lane, a promotions assistant at Tulsa
radio station KTFX. The station is co-sponsoring the Oklahoma race
with the United Cerebral Palsy group of Oklahoma.
   The Canadian foundation borrowed the fund-raising idea from a

   Margaret McMillan figures she might not
have been on hand to win a beauty pageant had she not given up
smoking _ sometime after World War I.
   The 104-year-old resident of a San Mateo convalescent home
topped a field of 10 spry contestants Thursday to win the annual
``My Fair Lady'' competition, beating out women who weren't even
born until the 20th century.
   ``I feel lucky,'' said Mrs. McMillan after being crowned at the
San Mateo County Fair. She won a tiara, a trophy, roses, gift
certificates from local stores and boxes of candy.
   Contestants were judged on poise, wit, personality, appearance
and their answers to questions about significant moments in their
lives and what they would do if they won $1 million.
   Asked beforehand her secret of longevity, Mrs. McMillan credited
``coming from good stock, luck, having a nip _ bourbon and water _
now and then, and not smoking. I did smoke at the beginning of my
life, but quit between World War I and World War II.''
   The My Fair Lady contest is open to wheelchair-using women
residents, age 80 and older, of convalescent hospitals in the San
Francisco Bay area.

   Most beach-goers aim for that smooth,
even tan, but some people are proud of spottier efforts.
   Categories at Thursday's Miscellaneous Sun Tanning Tournament in
this beach resort included the T-shirt tan, the ``Golden Dome''
award for bald-headed bronzing, and the ``Count Dracula'' division
for those who eschew the sun altogether.
   But those and other humorous categories _ including the
best-tanned back of the neck and the best-tanned soles of the feet
_ were tempered with warnings about the less-than-sunny risks of
tanning.
   ``It's going out of style to bake yourself to a crisp,'' said
Ocean City publicist Mark Soifer. ``Sunscreen products were given
out, and we kept repeating that people should be very careful and
not overdo it in the sun.''
   The one winner who did not have to worry about the sun was
Tinelle Attig of Egg Harbor City, who won the ``Count Dracula''
division for being the palest person on the beach.
   ``I asked what she did to get her tan and she said, `Nothing,'''
Soifer said.
   The judges included a local beauty queen, a representative from
Coppertone sun products and the city's recreation director, Soifer
said.

   Elaborate bonding rituals. Tribal chants.
Ceremonial plumage: A center spread in last month's National
Geographic?
   No, it's an anthropologist's-eye view of the Republican National
Convention.
   ``In other societies, you usually just get together and kill a
lot of pigs,'' says Martha Ward, a professor at the University of
New Orleans.
   In America, men in dark suits and women in red, white and blue
dresses travel long distances to attend meetings, discuss issues
and give speeches.
   But wait.
   ``People also stage feasts, wear costumes and extoll their
virtues, be they cooperation, loyalty, defense, aggression or
careful spending habits. And they do this all over the world, in
the Pacific, in Africa, in the United States.''
   The convention was ``classic anthropological drama,'' says Ward,
who viewed the spectacle on TV. She watched swaying figures in
funny hats and saw elaborately costumed primitive dancers; she
listened to delegates shout ``USA! USA!'' and heard echoes of
ancient tribal chants.
   ``Rituals of this kind transcend ordinary bureaucratic
actions,'' she says. ``We could get together and just nominate the
guy. It's been done already, anyhow. But it's important to have
rituals of connection. Ceremonies achieve many purposes, and most
of what happens is very predictable.''
   Gerald Ford's presence: ``Ancestor-worship,'' says Ward. ``They
have to pay homage to ancestors. They may rehabilitate one every
now and then and drag out his bones. Jimmy Carter got rehabbed for
the Democrats. Gerald Ford was brought out by the Republicans.''
   Stressing connections to the past serves a purpose. ``It gives
us a chance to discuss our values, to say these values are still
important. They've seen us through tough times in the past, and
they're good values for the future.''
   Opening and closing prayers: ``There's always a mild
supernatural element of worship. Regardless of whether it offends,
is constitutional or sectarian, it's going to be there. It's very
important that God bless the endeavor, that you make it known He's
on your side. ''
   Campaign hats and buttons are just so many tribal tattoos.
``When you're in a transitional period or celebrating something,
it's customary to alter your appearance. We do it for weddings, for
funerals, for graduations.'' Similar costumes reinforce unity.
``They want these people to move as a group.''
   The daily communal breakfasts, lunches and dinners are integral
to the proceedings. ``Nothing happens in human society without
food.''
   While most convention speeches contain little besides rhetoric,
the speakers' choice of imagery can speak volumes, Ward says. This
year brought less sports and battle imagery and more ``feminine''
themes _ home and hearth.
   ``Every person talked about their families, and paraded them out
at great length.''
   There was no shortage of tough talk directed at Democrats,
however. Ward calls that ``chest-beating. It's locker-room stuff.
They're patting these delegates on the rear end and sending them
out there to win. It's very contagious, what happens in groups. You
can't do this to yourself at home.''
   What happened this week in New Orleans ``has nothing to do with
survival, with eating or sleeping or feeding your kids, or even
with whether the country runs or not. It was pageantry, plain and
simple. It's a colossal game. That's why it's held in the
Superdome.''
   If the convention was a winner, the rituals will work their
magic.
   ``People will go home feeling involved and committed,'' says
Ward. ``They'll work hard for their leaders. Best of all, they'll
contribute _ money, labor, pigs, seashells.''

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was
supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator,
but the dream faded overnight.
   Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to
ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of
inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military
record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by
withdrawing from the ticket.
   Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle
managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about
family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush
administration.
   ``Let's go on to victory!'' Quayle exhorted, as the crowd
erupted in cheers.
   The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm
self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his
penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the
unanticipated controversy.
   Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was
``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.'' The two will stress the
unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend
through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.
   But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent
that threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's
grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The
Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf
of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him
very highly,'' the News reported.
   Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard
duty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said the matter was
discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to
his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he
used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
   Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle
from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested. Quayle was tense
and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a
brief walk-through at the convention hall.
   It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor,
rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been
compared to those of John F. Kennedy.
   Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech,
saying he was proud of the six years he served. He also addressed
his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan
Quayle?' The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.''
   Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out
their ammunition. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's name
in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect
concerns that he lacked experience for the job.
   ``He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator. ...
That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis,
and he is running for president,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the
nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality'' to
the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign.''
   Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national
ticket remains to be seen. Others, notably Democratic vice
presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could
not.
   But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be
daunted by the prospect. ``Miracles do happen,'' he told his party.

   An 8-month-old infant thwarted a
would-be burglar's attempt to steal a clock radio, the baby's

   Eight-month-old Selman Walker was sleeping next to his
17-year-old sister, Roxanne, when a burglar apparently tried to
reach through the window and take the radio, police said. But the
baby grabbed the cord, Roxanne Walker said Thursday.
   ``Anything that moves, the baby will grab it,'' she said. ``I
felt something moving and then the baby started laughing. I guess
he thought it was funny.''
   She described herself as a sound sleeper but said she was
awakened by the baby being tugged from the window, which opens onto
an alleyway.
   ``I grabbed him and then I screamed,'' she said, adding that the
thief panicked, let go of the radio and fled. She only saw a hand
and could not give police an accurate description of the man.

   Presidential nominees probably would prefer
to run without having to share the ticket. Running mates can be
such a burden sometimes.
   George Bush's day of acceptance, dulled by the questions that
surfaced about how Sen. Dan Quayle joined the National Guard in
1969, is only the latest problem to attach to a party's ticket.
   But usually it takes a little longer.
   After Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower chose young California senator
Richard Nixon to run with him in 1952, the campaign was roiled by
reports that a ``slush fund'' had been set up for him in California.
   As the issue festered, it seemed Eisenhower would drop his
running mate, but Nixon regained public support with a broadcast
speech in which he denied the implications. He said everything he
owned could be stripped from his family, except their dog,
Checkers. The address became known as ``The Checkers speech.''
   It was Nixon's turn next to be embarrassed by his running mate.
In 1968, after choosing little known Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, the
campaign was rocked by Agnew's greeting a reporter on the campaign
as a ``fat Jap.''
   Agnew insisted that he had meant no offense to the reporter,
with whom he had been friends, and the issue went away.
   In 1972, the Democratic convention chose Sen. George McGovern of
South Dakota to run for president and Sen. Thomas Eagleton of
Missouri to share the ticket.
   Ten days later, Eagleton disclosed he had voluntarily entered
hospitals three times between 1960 and 1966 for ``nervous
exhaustion and fatigue.'' Although he supported Eagleton after the
disclosure, McGovern cooled on his running mate and the Missouri
senator withdrew _ the first time a major party candidate left a
national ticket after a convention.
   In 1984, Democrat Walter Mondale announced his choice of Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro of New York in the week before the convention.
   She won nomination by acclamation, but immediately questions
were raised about the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro, a real
estate investor, and about her financial disclosure forms filed
with the Congress.
   To quiet the storm, she released reams of financial documents
and held a news conference in New York that allayed most questions,
but the affair distracted the Democratic campaigners from issues
they wanted to emphasize.

   It was the Republicans' richest fund-raiser
of the year, and all the big names were there: the Bushes, the
Quayles, the Doles; Jack Kemp and a fistful of senators; Muhammad
Ali, Rosie Grier, Leo Nadeau.
   Leo Nadeau.
   ``You're wondering: Who the hell is Leo Nadeau?'' the
silver-haired man told 4,500 mystified guests at the New Orleans
Convention Center, most of whom paid $1,000 to rub shoulders
Thursday with brighter luminaries.
   The answer: He was George Bush's tail-gunner 45 years ago, when
Bush was a Navy bomber pilot during World War II. And of all the
speakers who paid Bush tribute, Nadeau is the only one the vice
president thanked with a hug.
   ``We were just a couple of kids,'' Nadeau told the crowd as he
introduced his old war buddy. ``But we became men overnight.''
   They shared the stage Thursday under more pleasant
circumstances, helping raise roughly $4.3 million for the
Republican National Committee's operating budget. That was twice
what the RNC collected at its 1984 convention gala.
   The take amounted to the RNC's best ever for a $1,000-per-plate
affair, though the committee pulled in $5.8 million at a
higher-priced dinner-dance in 1984, said spokeswoman Katherine
Murray.
   This event was done up in style, staged on a ``Road to Victory''
theme with a strip of black carpet leading from a huge mockup of a
riverboat to a huge mockup of the White House. The wine bottles
bore RNC Gala labels. The menu included chicken breasts with ``GOP
fresh tarragon.''
   Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, arrived
with their wives in an antique fire engine led by a marching band.
Looking on were Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Kemp of New York,
who both ran against Bush and lost.
   And the real heavyweights: former boxing champion Ali, who
shared a table with Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah; and former
professional football player Grier, now a preacher. Grier gave the
invocation, first telling the standing assemblage: ``You can sit
down.''
   Gala chairman Lodwrick Cook took the microphone. ``Rosie,'' he
said, ``when you tell us to sit, we'll sit.''
   They paid to: in addition to the private and corporate donors
who shelled out $1,000 each, nine companies underwrote the party
with $100,000 donations.
   Bush rewarded the crowd with a preview of his acceptance speech.
He also stressed his loyalty to Quayle, who was embroiled in a
controversy over whether he used family connections to join the
National Guard and avoid the Vietnam draft in 1969.
   For his part, Nadeau spoke of his and Bush's wartime experience.
   ``There are millions of Americans like me, men and women who've
seen the face of war,'' he said. ``When we elect our next
commander-in-chief, we will have made sure he is someone who has
the courage and experience we can depend on for our lives and our
livelihoods.''
   Bush took up the theme. ``Leo Nadeau talked about a mission that
he and I shared. ... We had a mission. We knew what we had to do.
... And now I stand here as one of two people who will be president
of the United States of America. And I know that I've got a
mission. A new mission.''

   ``There's nothing to this,'' said a George
Bush campaign aide, engaging in a classic exercise in political
damage control to quell the controversy over Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle's military service.
   ``We have chased down every single rumor. We haven't been able
to substantiate one single rumor,'' Bush press secretary Sheila
Tate said Thursday after a three-hour afternoon meeting.
   Bush political aides were plunged into a wearying scramble by
the unanticipated questions raised about the Indiana senator,
questions that threatened to rob the campaign of the boost they
counted on getting from their national convention.
   They briefed the chairmen of state delegations to calm their
concerns and to assure them the whole matter had been overblown.
   During a series of meetings beginning Wednesday night and
continuing through Thursday, top Bush aides confronted the fact
that the Quayle flap also was endangering their careful plans for a
closing convention session that would have Bush firmly in the
spotlight as the new leader of the Republican Party.
   They discussed issuing a detailed statement ``citing chapter and
verse'' of how Quayle entered the Indiana National Guard in 1969
when many draftees were being sent to Vietnam, according to one
campaign aide who insisted on anonymity.
   Among the questions raised was whether Quayle, a member of an
influential publishing family, had sought and received special
treatment.
   But the idea of issuing a statement was dropped because it was
felt it would detract from Bush's acceptance speech.
   For the same reason, a Quayle news conference was vetoed.
   ``It's the vice president's night, why should Sen. Quayle hold
some big news conference?'' said Tate.
   When he arrived at the hall, Quayle refused to discuss the
matter with reporters.
   But the controversy could not be ignored.
   Influential Republicans were uneasy with the matter and
demanding answers.
   ``I don't like the fact that Quayle denied yesterday that
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had,''
said Rep. Helen Bentley, chairman of the Bush campaign in Maryland.
``Quayle can do one of two things: admit this and that he was a
liar _ or he can withdraw from the race.''
   Later, she backed away from her comment, claiming she had been
responding to inaccurate news reports.
   Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa said he was concerned that Quayle may
have misled Bush campaign officials when they asked about his
military service.
   ``If appropriate information was sought and appropriate
information wasn't forthcoming, then if I were George Bush I'd
reserve the right to reconsider,'' Tauke said.
   Bush aides moved swiftly to generate a swell of comment
downplaying the significance of the allegations.
   Campaign chairman James A. Baker III went on Cable News Network
to say, ``There's no substantiation. A lot of rumors, no
substantiation.''
   ``We're in the midst of a national convention, where you're
going to get a whole lot of rumors swirling, popping up every
hour,'' Baker said. ``But they pop up, nothing's produced and they
die. There hasn't been one thing. If you've got something I'd like
to hear about it.''
   During the closing convention session, a document was circulated
on the floor that cited news accounts quoting Indiana National
Guard officials as saying that no one needed special influence to
join in 1969.
   ``We would take anyone we could get,'' was a quote from former
Indiana Adjutant General John N. Owens.
   A second sheet that circulated was labeled, ``FACT SHEET: USE OF
NATIONAL GUARD.''
   ``When Dan Quayle joined the Army National Guard, guard units
were being called up and sent to Vietnam,'' said the material
compiled by the National Guard Bureau.
   Republican Party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. echoed that
view and also took another common approach, suggesting that somehow
the accounts were an insult to the National Guard.
   Fahrenkopf said the debate over Quayle's service seemed based on
the idea that ``somehow it's not honorable to be in the Guard or
Navy or Army reserves and that's ridiculous.''
   One of the most effective parts of the damage control strategy
was to have Quayle refer to his service in his speech accepting the
vice presidential nomination.
   ``As a young man, I served six years in the National Guard, and,
like millions of Americans who have served in the Guard and who
serve today _ and I am proud of that,'' he said to cheers.

   Republican strategists urged ``sensitivity''
toward Hispanic voters, and party heavyweights spent much of their
convention courting a group that could spell the difference in such
key states as Texas and California.
   The week opened with muted grumbling from some minority groups
about being excluded from the party, but that didn't extend to
Hispanics where party leaders said ``the environment is changing''
and the GOP must react.
   ``Whether it is welcome or unwelcome, the fact is the key
political factor in the Southwest is going to be the Hispanic vote
before the turn of the century,'' said Arizona Sen. John McCain.
   ``Our Republican Party is learning that if we're going to
prevail, if we're going to play a major role in politics in the
Southwest, we must have good Hispanic candidates,'' McCain told a
group of Hispanic teen-agers Thursday.
   The 265 young people, many of them yet too young to vote, were
brought to the convention from across the country for a lesson in
non-textbook politics. They heard speeches from various senators
and members of the family of presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``We are teaching them about politics, about the political
process,'' said Sandy Estrada, a Dallas-based political consultant.
``When they come to conventions, they're not going to be
intimidated.''
   Both parties are targeting the Hispanic vote in this election,
with Texas looming large because of its significant Hispanic
population.
   Bush claims Texas as his home, while Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis picked Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate.
   There is little hard evidence of any progress by either party. A
CBS News poll last month showed two-thirds of the blacks and
Hispanics polled backed Dukakis. McCain noted that President Reagan
got about 45 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1984 victory, but
conceded that figure is skewed because of his heavy support among
Cubans.
   McCain conceded the GOP has work to do before it can lure big
numbers of Hispanics.
   ``Why have the Republicans not done as well as they should have
done with the Hispanic vote?'' McCain said. ``Very frankly, a lot
of it has to do with concern and interest and sensitivity to issues
that affect the Hispanic community.''

   ``Meeting celebrities has never been something that thrills me.

   Actor Gary Merrill, suffering from lung
cancer, has been hospitalized for treatment of a chest infection, a
spokeswoman said.
   The 73-year-old Merrill, who appeared in the 1950 Oscar-winning
movie ``All About Eve'' and later married co-star Bette Davis, was
rushed to Mercy Hospital Tuesday from his Portland-area home.
Merrill said he had undergone exploratory surgery at the hospital
last week and was released after two days.
   ``I didn't slow down after they let me out,'' he said. ``I'm
like any other little kid. So they've grounded me; they want to
keep track of me.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Leslie Gall said Thursday that Merrill was
being treated for a skin infection in his chest wall and was in
good condition.
   Merrill's stormy 10-year marriage to Davis ended in divorce.

   One day after his company filed for
bankruptcy protection, moviemaker Dino De Laurentiis' estranged
wife filed for divorce.
   The divorce papers filed Wednesday by Silvana De Laurentiis in
Superior Court cite irreconcilable differences and seek unspecified
spousal support.
   The couple was married July 18, 1949, and separated in September
1983, the petition said.
   De Laurentiis Entertainment Group filed for protection from
creditors Tuesday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code,
which allows the company to operate while it reorganizes.
   De Laurentiis, who produced such films as ``Blue Velvet'' and
``Crimes of the Heart,'' owns 61.9 percent of the company. He
stepped down from management in February.

   New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump says
half-seriously that he wishes media mogul Rupert Murdoch hadn't
sold the New York Post.
   ``Rupert, come back!'' Trump implored Thursday at a breakfast at
the Republican National Convention.
   Trump accused new Post publisher Peter Kalikow of picking on him
in the newspaper at the same time Kalikow persuaded him to buy
advertising for a department store chain Trump controls.
   ``You son of a gun, you're killing me,'' said Trump, who related
that a Post reporter called him about the same time as the
advertising request to ask whether the stores were closing.
   ``You don't know how devastating that is to employee morale'' to
see stories like that in the paper, Trump said.
   Kalikow, who bought the financially ailing paper in March, was
sitting a few feet away in the audience. Trump sounded at least
half-serious, and while Kalikow was laughing, he looked
uncomfortable.

   Writer Gary Giddins plans to change the date
Louis Armstrong was born _ at least in print.
   Giddins' biography of the jazz trumpeter, ``Satchmo,'' to be
published in November, will give Armstrong's birth date as Aug. 4,
1901. Armstrong, who died in 1971, celebrated his birthday on July
4 and said he was born in 1900.
   Giddins is not the first to question Armstrong's birth date.
James Lincoln Collier's 1983 biography ``Louis Armstrong: An
American Genius'' placed the correct birth year at 1898.
   Writing about his research in the current issue of the Village
Voice, Giddins said he found a baptismal record for Armstrong at
the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans that gave his birth
date as Aug. 4, 1901.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Age Discrimination Cases Settled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 4,000 former Westinghouse
Electric Corp. employees denied severance pay because of their age
could share $35 million in what is believed to be the largest
settlement of a discrimination case.
   ``We broke some new ground,'' Charles Shanor, general counsel of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said Thursday.
   EEOC's negotiators were armed with a federal court ruling that
Westinghouse violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act when
it denied severance pay to employees who were eligible for pensions
after their jobs were eliminated in plant closings that began in
1980.
   The EEOC sued Westinghouse in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the
early 1980s. The Pennsylvania suit was expanded in 1984 to include
Westinghouse employees nationwide, except those represented in the
New Jersey suit.
   A federal judge in New Jersey dismissed that suit, and the EEOC
appealed to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
In the Pennsylvania suit, however, a federal district judge ruled
in the agency's favor, and Westinghouse appealed that decision to
the 3rd Circuit.
   ``The district court held...that forcing a pension-eligible
employee to choose between the pension and severance is unlawful,''
Shanor said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   The resolution of the suits, if approved in federal court, will
probably be the largest cash settlement ever in a discrimination
case if it is approved in federal court, Shanor said.
   Westinghouse believes 4,000 former employees, who were primarily
blue-collar production workers, should share the $35 million, an
estimate the EEOC will check.
   ``If our checking...reveals a disparity then the settlement is
off,'' Shanor said.
   Westinghouse said it agreed to deposit the money in escrow for
distribution after various conditions are met.
   First, the 3rd Circuit Court must agree to suspend ruling on the
case until a U.S. District Court in Philadelphia rules on the
fairness of the settlement. The lower court is expected to convene
a hearing where the former employees can comment, said EEOC
spokeswoman Margaret Fernandez.
   Other contingencies include an agreement between the company and
the agency that a layoff policy being proposed by Westinghouse is
lawful, she said.
   Among other large discrimination suit settlements, Pan Am Corp.
agreed earlier this year to pay $17.2 million and offer training to
pilots it had barred from continuing to work as flight engineers
once they reached age 60, Mrs. Fernandez said.
   Shanor said he knew of at least two similar pending cases
against other companies, which he declined to identify.

   A man lost his collection of 7,690 wild
birds' eggs and was fined $1,496 after being convicted of violating
wildlife laws.
   David Hargreaves Brierley, 49, an unemployed upholsterer, was
convicted Thursday of possessing the eggs for sale. The small
courtroom was cramped because eggs filled most of the public seats.
   Prosecutors said Brierley acted as a warehouseman for collectors
of illegal eggs. He had eggs from such rare species as merlins,
Dartford warblers and red-backed shrikes, they said.
   The Wildlife and Countryside Act outlawed collecting of wild
birds' eggs in Britain in 1982. Magistrates in this city in
north-central England ordered Brierley's collection confiscated.
   Officials of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
helped bring the case to court.

   President Reagan telephoned Vice
President George Bush to congratulate him after his acceptance
speech at the Republican National Convention, the president's
spokesman said.
   Marlin Fitzwater, assistant to the president for press
relations, said Reagan told the vice president, ``Congratulations.
It was a great speech, and we're all with you, George.''
   Fitzwater said the president and First Lady Nancy Reagan watched
the speech on television at their ranch north of here, where they
are vacationing.
   Reagan, who also watched Wednesday night's convention
proceedings on television, met earlier Thursday with the
prize-winning author who is writing his biography.
   Fitzwater said Reagan was meeting Thursday with Edmund Morris,
who won the Pulitzer Prize for biography for his book, ``The Rise
of Theodore Roosevelt.'' Morris, who has been given special access
to the president for the project, has declined to talk with
reporters about the book, explaining that was part of his agreement
with the White House.
   Fitzwater said Reagan did routine paperwork and went horseback
riding with Mrs. Reagan after breakfast.
   He signed five bills Wednesday, including one increasing the
amount of money for presidential transitions, beginning with his
early next year. The amount for the incoming president and vice
president is increased from $2 million to $3.5 million and the
amount for the outgoing president and vice president goes from $1
million to $1.5 million.
   The president goes to Irvine, Calif., next Tuesday for a
fund-raising luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and will
continue on to Los Angeles, where he will likely make a joint
appearance with Bush on Wednesday.
   The Reagans will return to Washington on Sept. 8 and are
expected to visit the ranch once more, at Thanksgiving, before the
president's term ends in January.

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle spent his six years in the
Indiana National Guard as a clerk-typist in the 120th Public
Information Detachment helping to turn out a quarterly magazine,
the Indiana National Guardsman.
   It wasn't difficult duty, recalled one member of the 12-member
unit.
   ``The magazine had a lot of mushy little feature stories in it
that didn't require too much effort,'' said James G. Newland Jr., a
reporter for The Indianapolis Star.
   ``We had some free time and it wasn't odd for us to drink some
beer and play cards during an extended lunch break or after
drill,'' Newland told the Star. ``We never failed to have a good
time.''
   Another member of the unit, Sam R. Graves III, former superviser
of the detachment, said Quayle was patriotic, pro-military and not
a draft-dodger.
   ``Politically, we are at opposite ends of the scale,'' said
Graves. ``But when I think of him, words like `integrity' come to
mind, `enthusiasm,' `patriotism'.''
   Quayle was nominated Thursday night as the Republican candidate
for vice president, and his membership in the Guard has come under
scrutiny following the disclosure that he may have used pull to get
in at a time when his contemporaries were being drafted and sent to
Vietnam.
   In Washington, Pentagon records showed that service in the
National Guard was not likely to lead to duty in Vietnam.
   Some 3.4 million servicemen and women were sent to Southeast
Asia during the Vietnam War. Only about 9,000 were in mobilized
Army and Air National Guard units.
   By the time the fighting ended, there had been more than 58,000
American casualties, of which 97 were guardsmen.
   Quayle had worked from 1965 to 1969 at his family's newspaper,
the Huntington Herald-Press, while studying political science at
DePauw University in Greencastle.
   He joined the Guard in May 1969 after his student deferment
expired. He started out as a clerk-typist.
   In 1973, Quayle was reclassified as a journalist, helping other
members of the 120th produce the award-winning magazine.
   Quayle met with the group at least one weekend a month and for
15 days of active duty during the summer.
   ``I do recall that on one occasion when he was there we had a
hell of a good time,'' said James A. Gillaspy, another former
member and now a reporter with the Indianapolis Star. ``He did his
job like the rest of us. And when the job was done, he partied like
the rest of us.''
   Graves objected to accounts that he said portrayed the group as
composed of slackers.
   ``It made the outfit look like all we did was sit around and
drink beer, and the kind of outfit in which you had to have
connections to get in,'' he said. ``There were times when we were
frenetic and other times when we had down time. But that doesn't
mean we were sitting around drinking all the time.''
   The same year he became a Guard journalist, Quayle was attending
law school in Indianapolis and working at a full-time job in the
state government. Graves said he and others occasionally missed
their Guard obligations but would make up for the absences later.
   ``In all those years in which I knew him, I was never once led
to believe that his family was moneyed or that he had any influence
to peddle,'' Graves said. ``He always did whatever he was told,
always with a certain amount of enthusiasm. He never quibbled.''
   On Thursday, retired Guard Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi, who
was managing editor of the Indianapolis News and worked for
Quayle's grandfather, publisher Eugene C. Pulliam, said he made a
phone call to help Quayle gain entry into the guard.
   Phillippi said Quayle asked him whether Guard units in Indiana
were likely to be sent to Vietnam.
   But Capt. Cathi Kiger, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Guard, said
that ``Across the board, we were under strength, so there were some
openings in the state.''
   She said records show the Guard's authorized strength on July
31, 1969, was 10,378, but that only 10,218 positions were filled.
   ``It's anything but a cushy job,'' said photographer Bob Jordan,
another former member of the group. ``I think a lot of people
thought it was.
   ``You tried to promote the National Guard and get as much ink,
like any other public relations outfit. You would try to promote
your own outfit, in that case the Indiana National Guard.''
   Quayle enlisted as a Private E-1, the lowest possible rank, and
rose to Specialist 5.

<TEXT>
   Moments after the last ``Bush '88'' chant
echoed through the cavernous Superdome and the last red, white and
blue balloons fell to the floor, a round-the-clock cleanup party
began.
   Republican National Convention delegates helped start the
process late Thursday by collecting home state signs and scavenging
``We Love George'' and ``Bush-Quayle'' placards as souvenirs.
   Standing at the ready beneath one of the network television
booths, 10 workers equipped with brooms and shovels waited for the
last delegate to leave so they could sweep up every piece of
refuse, every bit of confetti.
   ``We have to get started immediately after the session, we
really do,'' said Mary Mead, a spokeswoman for the convention. ``We
have to move fast.''
   Construction of the podium, stairways and wooden floors took
500,000 man-hours. It will take just 8,000 man-hours to rip down
the 1.2 million pounds of scaffolding, tear up the 150,000 square
feet of plywood and take out the 150,000 nuts, bolts and screws.
   The transformation from convention hall to football stadium and
special events center better be done on schedule, according to Ms.
Mead.
   ``There's a dual high school football game on Friday the 26th.
We have to be completely out of here on the 25th,'' she said.
   And if that isn't enough incentive, the New Orleans Saints host
the Pittsburgh Steelers that weekend in a nationally televised game.
   Pete Vicari, whose general contracting company built the
$560,000 podium, had 20 of his employees stripping the rostrum,
pulling up the carpets and removing the light fixtures late
Thursday.
   ``As of noon Friday, we'll just start demolishing and it will be
all hauled off to the dump,'' Vicari said. ``By Saturday, we should
be cleared out of the dome.''
   Fred Nodier of South Central Bell had half his staff working a
midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, tearing down the thousands of feet of
cable installed for the convention.
   The GOP parley required 9,000 lines of cable compared to the
last major event _ a Super Bowl and its 1,000 cable lines.
   ``It's monumental, but we have a good team,'' he said.
   The convention staff had its employees packing their files
together last weekend to ensure a speedy departure as soon as the
gavel was pounded to end the last session.
   ``It's just like when you put it together, you have to do it in
an organized fashion so you're not stumbling all over one
another,'' Ms. Mead said.

<HEAD>CDC: `Safe Sex' Message Not Heeded Enough By Minorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jump in the syphilis rate to the highest level
in 37 years shows that minorities, and particularly heterosexuals,
have failed to heed the message about practicing safe sex despite
the AIDS scare, health officials say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control on Thursday reported
35,241 cases of syphilis in the United States in 1987. The rate of
14.6 per 100,000 people was up from an estimated 11.4 a year
earlier and equaled the 1982 rate as the highest since the rate of
16.7 in 1950.
   Reported U.S. cases of syphilis rose 30 percent in two years,
from 27,143 or 11.5 per 100,000 in 1985, the CDC said.
   ``The increase ... was greatest for blacks and Hispanics _
groups for which incidence rates were already high,'' the CDC said
in its weekly report.
   The increases came during a period when sexually transmitted
disease rates were falling among homosexual men, the largest group
at risk for AIDS. The use of condoms and other safe-sex techniques
lessen the likelihood of contracting all venereal diseases.
   ``Homosexual men ... have taken safe sex messages seriously,''
said Dr. Joel Greenspan, a CDC specialist in sexually transmitted
diseases. ``They have changed their behavior. Minority people, and
particularly heterosexuals, have not gotten that message.''
   From 1986 to 1987, among Americans 15 to 64 years old, the
syphilis rate for black males increased 36 percent, from 106 per
100,000 people to 145, and the rate for black females shot up 43
percent, from 56 per 100,000 to 79.
   The rate for Hispanic males rose 7 percent, from 66 to 71 cases
per 100,000, while the rate for Hispanic women rose 24 percent,
from 18 to 22.
   In contrast, the rate for white males dropped from 6.4 to 5.7
cases per 100,000, apparently due to a drop in syphilis among
homosexual men. The rate for white females rose, but slightly, from
2.2 to 2.6, the CDC said.
   The increase in syphilis appears to be concentrated in a few
urban areas; 57 percent of all U.S. cases last year were reported
in Florida, California and New York.
   While the exact cause of the increase is not known, the CDC
speculated on some possible factors in January when it released its
preliminary syphilis figures for 1987, including:
   _An increase in prostitution in which the crack or other drugs
are exchanged for sex.
   _A decrease in the resources available for programs to control
syphilis.
   Syphilis, caused by a bacterium, can lead to the degeneration of
the bones, heart, nerve tissue and other parts of the body if left
untreated. The disease, which produces chancre sores, is treated
with antibiotics.
   In its report Thursday, the CDC suggested several steps to curb
the increase in syphilis, including a move to ``re-emphasize the
traditional methods of syphilis control _ interviews (with venereal
disease patients) and sex partner notification.''
   The agency also suggested screening for sexually transmitted
diseases in high-risk populations, assuring better access to
medical care through speedy service and evening hours, and further
surveillance efforts to monitor the problem.

extensively covered the death and funeral of a former president who
was a harsh critic of the regime.
   Radio Noticias owner Carlos Fabregas said Thursday that
officials from the Justice Ministry arrived at the station
Wednesday night and read an order to employees closing it for
``inciting subversion.''
   Fabregas spoke in a live interview over Radio Alegre, another
privately owned station. Ministry officials were not available for
comment.
   Radio Noticias closely reported the death last week and the
funeral on Monday of former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid.
   Arias, 86, who died in Miami, was three times elected president
and three times overthrown by the military.
   The funeral brought huge crowds into the streets of Panama City
in what became a protest procession against the government, which
Noriega controls as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces.
   ``The authorities are alarmed by this demonstration,'' Fabregas
said.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges,
which he denies.
   Dissent against Noriega and efforts by the Reagan
administration, including economic sanctions, have failed to force
the general out of power.
   Days after Noriega was indicted, President Eric Arturo Delvalle
tried to fire him as military chief. Noriega had the national
legislature oust Delvalle.
   Delvalle went into hiding, but the United States still
recognizes him as Panama's legitimate president.
   Since July 1987, the government has closed the opposition
newspapers La Prensa, Extra and El Siglo and the radio stations
Mundial and Continente. They reopened briefly at one point but were
closed again.
   The government also closed Quiubo, a satirical magazine, and
Gaceta Financiera, a financial weekly.
   It closed Channel 5, the television station owned by Delvalle,
soon after he was forced from office.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are developments related
to the controversy over the military service of Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE ISSUE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Whether Quayle, a conservative supporter of the military and a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, used the influence
of his prominent Indiana family to get a position in the National
Guard in 1969 and thus avoid being drafted for almost-certain
service in Vietnam.
   Also, whether he was totally candid with aides to presidential
nominee George Bush who questioned him about his National Guard
service and how he gained entry into the Guard. Of the more than
58,000 American casualties in the Vietnam war, 97 were Guardsmen.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE'S RESPONSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle told the national convention he was proud of his service
in the National Guard. His aides said there may have been calls
made on his behalf to get in, but they and he deferred all detailed
responses until today.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH'S RESPONSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush said he was proud to have Quayle on the ticket. His aides
circulated research papers on the convention floor which said that
there were vacancies in the Indiana Guard in 1969 and that no one
needed special influence to get in. The papers said that some Guard
units at that time were being called to duty in Vietnam.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DELEGATE REACTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Many rallied behind their vice presidential nominee and rebuked
the news media for focusing on the controversy. Some delegates said
they still want to hear a fuller explanation from the Indiana
senator. Others called it ``a tempest in a teapot,'' and predicted
the issue would quickly blow away.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATIC REACTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice president nominee Lloyd Bentsen, campaigning in
Texas, refused to criticize Quayle's service in the Guard. ``I'm
not going to question that,'' said Bentsen, a World War II bomber
pilot. ``I'm a strong supporter of the National Guard and always
have been. One of my own sons served in the National Guard.''

<HEAD>Something Close to Anarchy at the GOP Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the heart of George Bush's Republican
convention, some Republican rebels came to preach the gospel of
minimalist government.
   They were libertarians: believers in the smallest government
possible; the fewest government restraints on personal liberty and
freedom. They call it being ``fiscally conservative, socially
tolerant.''
   From a booth in a hotel marketplace selling convention
souvenirs, the Libertarian Republican Organizing Committee passed
out literature, searched for converts and, its officers said,
collected hundreds of names and addresses.
   Colin Hunter, owner of a computer software company in
California's Silicon Valley, is the organization's national
chairman.
   Essentially, Hunter and the libertarians embrace most of the
Reagan administration's economic programs but contend they have
fallen far short of perfection.
   Hunter and the libertarians would take the GOP out of social
issues almost entirely and they seek a noninterventionist foreign
policy, including deep cuts in defense budgets.
   Specifically, they advocate:
   _Fighting off a tax increase.
   _Fighting against protectionist trade legislation.
   _Making deep cuts in entitlement programs, including phasing out
Social Security and welfare.
   _Turning many government agencies and services over to private
enterprise.
   _Opposing all attempts to legislate morality.
   _Urging the legalization of drugs for adults.
   _Advocating a pro-choice policy on abortion.
   ``The emphasis is on individual liberty against the power of the
government,'' Hunter said in an interview.
   ``I've been extremely gratified by the response,'' he said,
adding that the most ``negative feedback'' his libertarian ideas
received at the Republican convention came from the supporters of
television preacher Pat Robertson.
   Hunter calls Robertson ``the Ayatollah.''
   Hunter says he founded his organization after coming to the
conclusion that the ideas of libertarianism could best flourish
inside the two-party system. He opposes the third-party strategy
represented by the national Libertarian Party as ``essentially
hopeless.'
   Hunter contends that the Republican party is not a monolith,
especially on social issues.
   ``Fifty percent of the delegates here are pro-choice,'' he
asserted, contending that the percentage among Republican voters as
a whole is higher than that.
   ``Other Republicans are afraid we'll turn the country over to
Jerry Falwell,'' he declared.
   The problem, he contended, is that the Republican Party has
``allowed the religious right to capture the reputation of being
the font of ideas. We think that the key ideological debate in
America is happening within the Republican Party.''
   He was asked about the proposal to legalize drugs.
   ``The parallels with prohibition are precise,'' he replied.
``There is now a massive crime wave. There are extremely high
profits involved. To us it's clear; the evils of making it legal
outweigh whatever. It will still be a vice, but not a crime.''
   He said aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua should end simply
because it has not worked, because the Contras have not ignited a
spark with the Nicaraguan people.
   ``We really have a giant welfare program for the Contras,'' he
said.
   Hunter said he did endorse U.S. aid to anti-Soviet insurgents in
Afghanistan, in part because it they had the obvious support of the
vast majority of the Afghan people.
   With all the changes his philosophy would impose, Hunter was
asked what laws libertarians would repeal if they had majority,
veto-proof control of both houses of Congress.
   ``The only law we would have to repeal is the law imposing
penalties for income tax evasion,'' he replied.
   An associate, Eric Garris, the organization's national director,
added: ``We believe that taxation is theft.''
   ``What we would actually do is reduce the size and scope of
government as quickly as possible, given the political situation
and given reality,'' Hunter said.

<HEAD>Senator Says Government to Extend Cease-Fire; Radio Station to
Reopen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government said it will
extend its unilateral cease-fire with Contra rebels and is ready to
resume peace talks immediately, according to a U.S. senator who met
with President Daniel Ortega.
   Also Thursday, the government said that Radio Catolica can go
back on the air, but without news broadcasts.
   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, spokesman for the Catholic
archdiocese in the capital, Managua, said Radio Catolica would
resume broadcasting today, 38 days after being ordered shut for
news coverage that allegedly incited violence.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who met Thursday with Ortega and
his brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, said the Sandinistas
are willing to resume peace talks immediately with the
U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras.
   ``There are no preconditions on talks'' with the rebels, Dodd
said at Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport shortly before leaving
Nicaragua.
   ``They said they would extend (the cease-fire) indefinitely,''
said Dodd, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs.
   The truce began March 21, two days before the government and
rebels signed an agreement to negotiate a permanent end to the
7-year-old war. High-level peace talks broke off June 9, and a
unilateral government extension of the cease-fire was set to expire
Aug. 31.
   Ortega on Thursday renewed his proposal to begin a new round of
talks in Managua on Aug. 26. The rebels, citing restrictions on
their freedom of movement, said they would not return to the
capital. They also demanded that the president take part in any
future discussions.
   The Interior Ministry has authorized the Roman Catholic Church's
radio station to resume broadcasting. An Interior Ministry
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Carballo sent a
letter Wednesday pledging the station will not broadcast news.
   The leftist government closed Radio Catolica indefinitely on
July 11, the same day it shut down La Prensa, the country's only
opposition newspaper, for 15 days. The orders came a day after
police violently broke up a demonstration by opposition groups.
   La Prensa has since resumed publication.
   The government said Radio Catolica's news program ``Church
News'' had ``incited violence, disorder and lack of respect for the
constitutional government.''
   Dodd also said he discussed with the Sandinistas the latest U.S.
Senate package to provide humanitarian aid to the Contras.
   ``Obviously they are not happy,'' Dodd said, adding that the
possibility of renewed U.S. military aid to the rebels was ``very
open'' and that the government ``should know about that.''
   U.S. military aid for the rebels expired in February. On Aug.
10, the Senate approved a $27 million humanitarian aid package for
the rebels with a possible second vote on $16.3 million in
stockpiled military aid later this year.

<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last night of the Republican National
Convention presented the television networks two stories, but
little time to pursue them.
   ``News has broken out, gentlemen,'' ABC's Brit Hume proclaimed.
   The big story was the controversy over Sen. Dan Quayle's
National Guard enlistment, and the related questions about what
this possible blot on the GOP vice presidential nominee said about
the man at the top of the ticket.
   The other story was how well Vice President George Bush would
deliver his acceptance speech, which was praised in advance by CBS
anchor Dan Rather as ``an excellent speech ... as you read it on
paper.''
   As NBC anchor Tom Brokaw noted, Bush's speech, and Quayle's
which preceded it, took up a lot of time when the cameras were
compelled to focus on Quayle and Bush in their own words, with a
partisan crowd cheering them on.
   It was time when floor reporters could not raise new questions,
or variations of older questions, about whether strings had been
pulled to get Quayle into the Guard.
   It was an advantage the Bush campaign gratefully accepted.
Quayle did talk briefly to reporters, promising to answer all their
questions about the controversy, but not now.
   ``Well, give him credit,'' Rather said, praising Quayle for
facing the microphones even if he said nothing.
   ABC's reporters engaged in some self-examination about the
media's role in the Quayle story, which the network's George Will
called a ``journalistic feeding frenzy.''
   ABC's David Brinkley said the day's big story was at least
partly a function of the thousands of reporters on the scene.
   ``If this had happened in the middle of the desert, you would
never have heard about it,'' Brinkley said. ``It was the first new
thing, the first unexpected thing, the first news we've had.''
   And the network's Jeff Greenfield said it had taken ``about 3{
seconds'' for a backlash against the media to appear on the
convention floor. Recalling the Watergate hearings, Greenfield
suggested the key question for the Bush brain trust was ``what did
they know and when did they know it?''
   Thus, Quayle's acceptance speech was a test, one which CBS
commentator Kevin Phillips likened to Richard Nixon's ``Checkers''
speech in 1952, which saved his spot as Dwight D. Eisenhower's
running mate. ``I'm not so sure he turned the corner,'' Phillips
said of Quayle.
   On Bush's speech, however, the networks were unanimous. It was
at least a good speech, and many thought it the best speech of
Bush's career.
   ``He looked presidential,'' Walter Cronkite said on CBS.
   ``A splendid piece of work, well delivered and well written,''
said NBC's John Chancellor.
   ``It was a George Bush I hadn't seen before ... effective; not
eloquent. He was studied, he was poetic,'' Brinkley said. ``He
delivered a good speech very well.''
   ABC's Sam Donaldson was alone in taking issue with some of what
Bush said, accusing him of distorting the record of Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis on guns, the pledge of allegiance and
whether the nation is in decline.
   Despite the outbreak of news, all three networks showed a
weakness for trivia.
   CBS, which went on an hour earlier than the competition, was
alone with murky, long-distance pictures of Quayle's motorcade as
it arrived at the Superdome.
   Later, both CBS and NBC jumped quickly on equally unedifying
coverage of Bush's motorcade, while ABC stayed with an interview
with Bush campaign chief James Baker until it, too, succumbed to
the majesty of a vice-presidential auto ride.
   CBS again scored over the competition by having exclusive
pictures of Bush actually stepping out of his limousine.
   No one could resist the balloon drop. ``They've gotta be
hand-tied,'' Brokaw marveled.
   Rather at least put the balloons and the rest of the spectacle
in some perspective by recalling the attitude of President Reagan's
campaign advisers _ ``Just put up our pictures, and we'll take it
and win the election.''
   Perhaps with that in mind, CBS was alone in refusing to carry
Bush's short campaign film. Instead, it put up the same warm images
with commentary by Bill Plante.

   Government troops overran a rebel camp,
killing four men, taking two prisoners and capturing a cache of
arms and ammunition, an army official said.
   Lt. Col. Godfrey Bamwesigye said Thursday that the battle
occurred this week, but he didn't say when. He said the rebels were
army deserters who had been members of the Uganda Federal
Democratic Movement and the Uganda Freedom Movement.
   Both movements fought alongside President Yoweri Museveni's
National Resistance Army during a five-year guerilla war against
former civilian President Milton Obote.
   Obote was overthrown in a July 1985 military coup. Museveni
established a broad-based government that included several other
former guerrilla groups, including the Uganda Federal Democratic
Movement and the Uganda Freedom Movement.
   Since then, Museveni has had to fight at least eight guerrilla
groups trying to bring down his government.

<HEAD>Issue Stuns Convention, But Delegates Rally Around Their Man</HEAD>

   The question of whether Dan Quayle pulled
strings to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam war
dominated the last day of the Republican convention but by night's
end many delegates had rallied behind their vice presidential
nominee.
   Some delegates said they still want to hear a fuller explanation
from the Indiana senator. But others called it small potatoes and
predicted the issue would blow away quickly.
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said, ``If the worst thing Dan Quayle's
ever done in his life is that his dad helped him commit six years
to America in the National Guard, he's almost eligible for
sainthood. He certainly isn't disqualified from being vice
president.''
   Gordon K. Durnil, the head of the Indiana delegation, called it
``an anchor-booth generated story. ... Tomorrow it will be over and
there will be something else.''
   William Brock, the former national GOP party chairman and labor
secretary, said, ``I think we had a 24-hour problem.''
   John Katopodis of Birmingham, Ala., a Jefferson County
commissioner, said he had ``an uneasy feeling another shoe is going
to drop.'' He said he wished Quayle had tackled the issue
``head-on'' in his acceptance speech.
   Quayle, 41, drew cheers when he said he was ``very proud'' of
his six years in the National Guard. He made no further reference
to the controversy. By joining the Guard, he was almost certain of
avoiding service in Vietnam.
   Eddie Mahe, a Republican strategist from Washington, said that
``15,000 people (got) to experience that inside-the-beltway feeling
we live with all the time.''
   More than a few delegates said that if Quayle's aim was to stay
out of Vietnam in 1969, he had plenty of company.
   In those days, said Gene Ward, the chairman of the Hawaii
delegation and a Vietnam veteran, ``everybody and their uncle was
trying to get an angle about how to get out of the draft.''
   ``They used to say you were bad if you went to Vietnam, and now
they're saying ... if you didn't, that you're somehow unpatriotic.
How times have changed!'' said Ward.
   Samuel Atkins, 43, a Watkinsville, Ga., lawyer, said the ``baby
boomers will understand, but the older generation may hold it
against him.''
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley of Maryland, who initially suggested
Quayle might have to withdraw, said Thursday night the issue was
``dead'' and had been based on ``inaccurate news reports.''
   ``What's the big deal?'' asked Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, a staunch conservative. ``He pulled some strings to
serve his country. He could have gone to Canada.''
   Rep. Bob Dornan of California said, ``It requires a
Checkers-like speech ... quickly, before this gets out of hand,'' a
reference to the speech that Richard M. Nixon delivered in 1952
when he got caught up in a ``slush fund'' controversy. Nixon,
running mate to Dwight D. Eisenhower, said he would not give back
one gift, a dog named Checkers.
   George Walker Bush Jr., the vice president's eldest son, called
the furor over Quayle's military service ``ridiculous'' and said he
joined the National Guard, too, in 1968.
   ``It was available and I went,'' said Bush, 42, who was a
stateside pilot. ``I thought it was service to my country and I'm
proud of (it).''
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Navy fighter pilot who spent 5{
years in a Hanoi prison, said serving in the Guard is honorable.
   ``If, however, there is clear evidence that the process may have
been manipulated to give some kind of special preference, then I
think it's a problem ... that needs to be resolved,'' McCain said.
   If Quayle had ``gone to Canada, I would have been on the floor
protesting,'' said Richard Geist, a state lawmaker from Altoona, Pa.
   Tom Burch, a former Green Beret who is chairman of the
250,000-member Vietnam Veterans Coalition, called it ``a tempest in
a teapot.''
   ``There was nothing unusual'' about opting for the National
Guard, and even if his family helped ``it wouldn't make any
difference,'' said Burch, a Virginia delegate. ``He didn't try to
evade the military.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new elementary school in one of the nation's
most criticized school systems will ``reinvent the wheel,'' its
founder says, by using corporate-style management to boost learning
like they do profits.
   The school, dedicated Thursday, has gained the blessing and the
backing of such giants of capitalism as McDonald's Corp. and United
Airlines.
   ``It's a compelling plan to educate young people _ not only in
Chicago but across the country,'' McDonald's spokeswoman Stephanie
Skurdy said after the dedication of the Corporate-Community School
on the city's West Side.
   The school will be run like a business _ meaning that if
principal Elaine C. Mosley, a former elementary school principal in
suburban Oak Park, is unable to produce a superior ``product'' _
students _ she could be replaced, said Joe Kellman, the school's
founder.
   The tuition-free school, slated to begin classes Sept. 6 with
150 students and seven teachers, is being subsidized by almost
three dozen sponsors.
   Sixteen of the corporations raised $2 million of the $3 million
needed to run the school for three years, officials said. The
annual cost is about $4,100 per student, about the same as the cost
to educate public school students.
   ``It's a model project, hopeful for urban reform in school
programs,'' said Elaine Younglove, spokeswoman for another sponsor,
United Airlines, which has pledged $300,000 in support over a
three-year period. McDonald's has given $75,000.
   ``We thought it was an opportunity. ... There's a high dropout
rate in Chicago, and that's one of our personal concerns, getting
that dropout rate down,'' she said Thursday night.
   Chicago schools last year were called the nation's worst by U.S.
Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who labeled the city's
educational bureaucracy ``the blob'' and said the system was in
``educational meltdown.''
   Nearly 45 percent of students who began school with the class of
1985 dropped out before graduating, and half of the city's public
high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent of U.S. schools for
student scores on the American College Test, statistics have shown.
   The Corporate-Community School will try to start students out on
a better foot.
   `We're going to reinvent the wheel,'' said Kellman, 68, head of
the Globe Glass & Mirror Co. and founder of the Better Boys
Foundation. ``We're going to turn out inner city children with a
great education.''
   The first wave of youngsters _ most of them black or Hispanic _
were chosen randomly by computer from 2,000 applications for the
initial pre-school through third grade program. The seven teachers
were selected from 200 applicants from around the nation, said
project director Primus Mootry.
   Classes are to be organized by skill level rather than age, so
slower students are not predisposed to an early image of failure,
organizers said. The curriculum will emphasize basics of reading,
writing, arithmetic and spelling, as well as the development of
social and reasoning skills.
   Mootry said one teacher and one teacher's aid will be assigned
to each class of 25 pupils, and parental involvement will be
encouraged,
   ``The real challenge is to work without some of the constraints
of the public school system,'' which has 430,000 students, Mootry
said.
   Plans call for the school to be expanded over the next several
years to a 300-student facility with classes up to the eighth grade.
   Frank Gardner, Chicago Board of Education president, told
reporters the city's public school system will be watching the new
school carefully.
   ``We applaud this and if we can transfer anything to our
schools, we will take advantage of it,'' he said.
   Charles Ruder, a spokesman for corporate sponsor Sears, Roebuck
& Co., said, ``It is an experiment we thought we ought to be a part
of. ... Communities that we do business in _ it's important that
they be viable, and education is a key to that.''
   Other sponsors include Quaker Oats Co., Baxter International
Inc. and Walgreen Drug Stores.

   The new George Bush looks, sounds and acts a
lot like the old one _ but he stands alone now, with a scant three
months to prove himself a leader who deserves the kind of loyalty
he has been delivering.
   His hour upon the stage at the Republican National Convention
was a solid sendoff for the campaign against Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, even though Bush image-makers
oversold the performance. They had said it was going to a sort of
debut, an introduction to the American electorate.
   Bush himself said it was the most important speech of his
career, an unmatched opportunity to present himself and his goals.
   But this was no transformation. Indeed, if one were needed, the
vice president, self-described underdog to Dukakis, would be in far
worse campaign trouble.
   He needed no introduction. He needed to blend the promise of
continuity with a set of goals to call his own. That is the task,
and the dilemma, that makes running for president as vice president
a daunting assignment.
   Bush also had to get his convention back on its script, after a
day of controversy over the military record of Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, his vice presidential nominee.
   That issue remains a problem for Quayle, and therefore for Bush,
but it barely intruded on the GOP finale. Quayle was nominated
without so much as a murmur of dissent, and drew no louder cheers
than when he said he was proud of his stint in the National Guard,
the service that kept him out of the Vietnam draft.
   It was a distraction Bush didn't need on a night he and his
strategists considered crucial. Had Bush stuck to his plan to name
his running mate on Thursday, instead of moving it up two days, he
would have avoided the Quayle flap. Questions about his military
record, and about string-pulling to get into the National Guard,
surely would have arisen. But they wouldn't have emerged in the
hothouse atmosphere of a political convention, where such things
flourish.
   Nevertheless, Bush accomplished what he set out to do. He said
his piece with humor and style. He played the cheering crowd
effectively, sometimes speaking over the din, sometimes pausing to
take the ovations.
   Neither Dukakis nor Bush ranks among the masters of political
oratory. Both Dukakis and Bush rose to their occasions, the
Democratic nominee in his Atlanta acceptance speech and Bush in his
Thursday night address.
   Bush said it was the night his campaign really began. He spoke
of the achievements of the Reagan administration, and claimed a
piece of the credit. But the pronoun changed from ``we'' to ``I''
as he dealt with the campaign ahead and with the measures he said
he will take in the White House.
   He said he had helped Reagan for 7 1@2 years with candor and
with loyalty. ``But now you must see me for what I am: the
Republican candidate for president of the United States,'' the vice
president said.
   ``This election isn't about ideology, it's about competence,''
Dukakis had said in Atlanta.
   ``Competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the
gears mesh but doesn't for a second understand the magic of the
machine,'' said Bush. ``The truth is, this election is about the
beliefs we share, the values we honor, the principles we hold
dear.''
   Debating Dukakis, joking about his lack of charisma and about
putting his silver foot up to relax, etching his own set of
proposals for a new administration, Bush gave what Republican
cheerleaders called the speech of his life.
   ``He had to,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York. ``He was
like a man down to his last $10 in a poker game. He had to win it,
otherwise he's out.''
   There are a good many hands to be played before the Nov. 8
election decides who really is out.

   Here are some comments on the presidential
race as the Republicans wound up their national convention in New
Orleans.
   
   GEORGE BUSH, accepting the presidential nomination of his party:
``There are a lot of great stories in politics about the underdog
winning _ and this is going to be one of them. I mean to run hard,
to fight hard, to stand on the issues _ and I mean to win.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, alluding to the controversy over his military
service: ``As a young man, I served six years in the National
Guard, and, like millions of Americans who have served in the Guard
and who serve today _ and I am proud of that.''
   
   REP. BOB DORNAN of California, saying Quayle must act swiftly to
diffuse the controversy over his military service: ``It requires a
Checkers-like speech, and he must do _ must do it _ quickly, before
this gets out of hand.''
   
   LEO NADEAU, the vice president's tail-gunner when Bush was a
Navy bomber pilot during World War II, plugging Bush for president:
``When we elect our next commander-in-chief, we will have made sure
he is someone who has the courage and experience we can depend on
for our lives and our livelihoods.''

<HEAD>Government Outlaws Palestinian Popular Committees</HEAD>

   Israel dealt a strong blow to the Palestinian
rebellion in the occupied lands, outlawing Arab popular committees
and threatening their members and supporters with arrest and
10-year jail terms.
   Popular committees are grass-roots organizations carrying out
the directives of the uprising's underground leadership, organizing
demonstrations and patrols and supplying food and medical aid to
the needy.
   The decision to outlaw them came amid a two-day general strike
launched in the West Bank on Thursday to protest Israel's policy of
deporting Arab activists. The strike orders were passed around the
West Bank by masked youths, many of whom shouted their message on
loudspeakers.
   Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli troops throughout
the occupied lands Thursday, leaving 11 Arabs wounded. Red Cross
and hospital officials in the Gaza Strip said soldiers beat and
clubbed more than 250 Palestinians.
   A three-day curfew in the Gaza Strip ended Thursday, but 180,000
Arabs in 11 refugee camps and neighborhoods remained confined to
their homes. In addition, 85,000 West Bank Palestinians from nine
villages and camps were under curfew.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said his decision to outlaw the
popular committees would create legal means of ``dealing with the
activists'' of the Palestinian uprising.
   ``But this is a formal, judicial step that does not abolish the
need ... to capture, arrest, put on trial or deport these people,''
he said on Israel radio.
   The Defense Ministry said every Palestinian who continues to be
a member of the committees or assist them would be arrested and put
on trial.
   The committees stage underground classes in case of school
closure by the Israeli authorities. They gather donations for
families of the uprising's ``martyrs,'' Arab prisoners or those who
who lost their jobs in Israel during the 8-month-old rebellion.
   Palestinians appeared enraged by Rabin's decision.
   Khanan Ashrawi, a lecturer at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank, said the step was ``only an excuse for further escalation.''
   ``The essence of the committees is that they're popular. They
are trying to strike at all the Palestinians. In that case, they
will deport everybody. It's definitely a policy and it's a ruthless
policy,'' she told The Associated Press.
   Meanwhile, representatives of the European Community lodged a
protest with the Foreign Ministry, expressing ``grave concern''
over the deportations, ministry spokesman Alon Liel said. Delegates
from Spain, Greece and Germany were told deportations were
necessary to maintain law and order, he said.
   The Foreign Ministry also said it was checking allegations in a
16-page Amnesty International report claiming Israeli troops have
beaten thousands of Arabs since the uprising began in December. The
ministry said the London-based human rights group conferred with
biased sources.

   Kathy Mattea has gone from being a
Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum tour guide to having three
nominations for the 22nd annual Country Music Association Awards.
   ``You can knock me over with a feather,'' she said. ``This is
amazing.''
   In nominations announced Thursday, Ms. Mattea found out she is a
finalist for single of the year for ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen
Roses'' and album of the year for ``Untasted Honey,'' besides No. 1
female vocalist.
   Grammy winners K.T. Oslin and Randy Travis each garnered
nominations in four categories, including top vocalist, the
association announced.
   Some of the biggest stars in country music _ Willie Nelson,
Kenny Rogers, Barbara Mandrell, the Oak Ridge Boys, Loretta Lynn
and Ricky Skaggs _ were not among the finalists. And the band
Alabama, which has dominated country music awards this decade, is a
finalist in one category _ vocal group of the year.
   Oslin, who's been singing country music less than two years, was
voted a finalist for top female vocalist, single of the year for
``Do Ya'' and Horizon Award for a rising star. She also received
two nominations in the song of the year category as composer of the
Grammy-winning ``80's Ladies'' and ``Do Ya.''
   Travis, a former short-order cook and dishwasher, is a finalist
for entertainer of the year, male vocalist of the year and single
and song of the year, both for his self-penned ``I Told You So.''
He won a Grammy in February for ``Always and Forever.''
   Completing the finalists for entertainer of the year, the top
award, are the Judds, 1986 winner Reba McEntire, George Strait and
1987 winner Hank Williams Jr.
   Joining Ms. Mattea, Ms. McEntire, Ms. Oslin as finalists for
female vocalist of the year are Roseanne Cash and Tanya Tucker.
   Other finalists for top male vocalist are veteran Vern Gosdin,
fast-rising Ricky Van Shelton, Strait and Williams.
   Winners will be announced during a two-hour CBS television
special Oct. 10 with Dolly Parton.
   Ms. McEntire, a former rodeo barrel racer, has been voted No. 1
female vocalist for an unprecedented four straight years.
   Travis was voted male vocalist of the year last year and won top
album for ``Always and Forever'' and No. 1 single for ``Forever and
Ever.''
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duo, have won the vocal group of
the year award three straight times and are a finalist again this
year. Others are the Bellamy Brothers, Foster & Lloyd, the O'Kanes
and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   Ms. Cash, daughter of country music star Johnny Cash, is also
nominated for single of the year for ``Tennessee Flat Top Box,'' a
song written about 30 years ago by her father.
   Her third nomination is with husband Rodney Crowell for vocal
event of the year. This is a new category for two or more
performers who do not normally sing together. They recorded the
recent hit duet, ``It's Such a Small World.''
   Winners and finalists are picked by the approximately 7,000
singers, songwriters, musicians, disc jockeys and others in country
music.

<TEXT>
   In 1939, Arnold Childs had everything a
21-year-old could ask for: his health, good friends, an Ivy League
college degree and a promising job at NBC in New York City.
   But the idealistic youth gave it up to cut wood, dig potatoes
and do maintenance on a Vermont farm, part of an Depression-era
experiment in communal living intended to show that citizenship
means community service.
   The camp in the tiny town of Tunbridge, population 200 at the
time, soon became a darling of Eleanor Roosevelt and the focus of
nationwide media attention. But it was closed after only three
years when World War II claimed many of the men who volunteered.
   On Thursday, some of the work crew were reunited as dozens of
people came to Tunbridge to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
birth of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, a Dartmouth College professor who
helped found Camp William James and others like it in the 1930s. He
died in 1973.
   Rosenstock-Huessy's idea was to develop a service program in
which young adults from across the country would live together and
perform chores that would benefit the community.
   ``The idea was to actually make some changes in the Civilian
Conservation Corps,'' the New Deal program established in 1933 to
give jobs to unemployed youths, said Jack Preiss, who helped found
the camp and wrote a book about it.
   ``What we were trying to do is make the corps, the work service,
a more democratic opportunity because it was confined to unemployed
kids from the cities,'' he said. ``And we felt public service is
something everyone should do,'' from college students to youths in
the slums to young adults in Tunbridge.
   The camp was founded on philosopher William James' theory that
work service is the ``moral equivalent of war'' _ that uniting
people from all walks of life could foster peace, camaraderie and
the spirit of community.
   ``We could never really have war if people are working face to
face,'' said Rosenstock-Huessy's granddaughter, Margaret Huessy.
``I don't think anyone could actually kill anyone if they knew
them.''
   Childs, 69, a Columbus, Ohio, native who now lives in Eugene,
Ore., left his New York job when he heard about the camp from
fellow Dartmouth graduates. ``I was getting a little tired of the
city and I thought the project would be an adventure,'' he said.
   At first, he and other participants lived in barracks at a CCC
camp in the nearby central Vermont town of Sharon. They harvested
crops, worked on machinery and cleared fire lanes.
   ``I was milking 15 Holsteins twice a day,'' said Preiss, 68, now
a sociology professor at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   To develop the experiment, they solicited government funds and
tried to gain community support by assisting residents with farm
and other tasks.
   The camp, which moved to Tunbridge when the workers acquired a
farm, was visited by Mrs. Roosevelt in 1941.
   It also caught the eye of journalist and poet Dorothy Thompson,
who presented President Franklin Roosevelt with citizen petitions
asking him to support the camp. She collected the papers in the
Tunbridge Town Hall basement, where former campers and other
students of Rosenstock-Huessy gathered for lunch Thursday.
   Preiss and others said the spirit of the camp remained when it
folded in 1942 and they returned to mainstream society. The camp
was cited when the Peace Corps was established in 1961, Preiss said.
   Childs spent 1970 to 1980 overseas working for the United
Nations' world food program. ``I found that particularly working in
countries like India and Nepal, the work I did on the farms and
Camp William James _ I can definitely see the connection between
development work and (work at the camp).''
   After lunch, the former campers went outside to perform one last
community service project. They fanned out in Tunbridge's
cemeteries to map veterans' gravestones for Memorial Day ceremonies
next year.
   ``Citizenship means giving something back to the community,''
Preiss said.

   Attorney General Maung Maung was named
Friday as chairman of Burma's ruling party, the country's first
civilian leader in 26 years, Japan's Kyodo news service reported
from Rangoon.
   Maung Maung, 63, was picked as chairman at an emergency meeting
of the central committee of the Burma Socialist Program Party, the
agency said.
   The agency quoted the state-run Radio Rangoon.
   Maung Maung is one of only two civilians in the top ranks of the
government hierarchy.
   He is considered a relative moderate, and thought more
acceptable than other figures to Burmese who took to the streets in
waves in the past two weeks to topple hard-line President Sein Lwin
and press demands for an end to a quarter-century of military
dominated, authoritarian rule.

   Former Michigan Gov. George Romney says he
didn't miss a thing by skipping a trip to the Republican National
Convention.
   Romney, who himself was a presidential contender in 1968, gave
up his delegate seat to make room in the Michigan contingent for a
supporter of television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   In a telephone interview from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Romney
said he had no regrets about the decision to stay home.
   ``I'm following the convention and probably I'm seeing more of
it than the people there. And I'm sober,'' he said.
   Since the nomination of George Bush was never in question, the
significance of one delegate's vote was diminished, he said.
   ``There's no decision I would have made anyway,'' Romney said.

speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination.
   ``It was a tough couple of days, you know. The Quayle thing was

   Questions circulated all day about the military service of
Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, who joined the
National Guard and thereby was out of reach of the draft during the

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Vice
President George Bush to the Republican National Convention on
Thursday night as he accepted the party's presidential nomination.
   Thank you ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.
   I have many friends to thank tonight. I thank the voters who
supported me. I thank the gallant men who entered the contest for
this presidency this year, and who've honored me with their
support. And, for their kind and stirring words, I thank Governor
Tom Kean of New Jersey, Senator, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas,
President Gerald Ford _ and my friend, and my friend, President
Ronald Reagan.
   I accept your nomination for president. I mean to run hard, to
fight hard, to stand on the issues _ and I mean to win. (Applause).
   There are a lot, there are a lot of great stories in politics
about the underdog winning _ and this is going to be one of them.
   And we're going to win with the help of Senator Dan Quayle of
Indiana _ a young leader who has become a forceful voice in
preparing America's workers for the labor force of the future. What
a superb job he did here tonight.
   Born in the middle of the century, in the middle of America, and
holding the promise of the future _ I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at
my side. (Applause).
   Many of you have asked, many of you have asked, ``When will this
campaign really begin?'' Well, I've come to this hall to tell you,
and to tell America: Tonight is the night.
   For seven and a half years I've helped the president conduct the
most difficult job on Earth. Ronald Reagan asked for, and received,
my candor. He never asked for, but he did receive, my loyalty. And
those of you who saw the president's speech last week, and listened
to the simple truth of his words, will understand my loyalty all
these years.
   And now, now you must see me for what I am: the Republican
candidate for president of the United States. And now I turn to the
American people to share my hopes and intentions, and why and where
I wish to lead.

   And so tonight is for big things. But I'll try to be fair to the
other side. I'll try to hold my charisma in check. And ...
(Applause).
   I reject the temptation to engage in personal references. My
approach this evening is, as Sergeant Joe Friday used to say,
``Just the facts, ma'am.'' (Applause).
   And after all, after all, the facts are on our side.
   I seek the presidency for a single purpose, a purpose that has
motivated millions of Americans across the years and the ocean
voyages. I seek the presidency to build a better America. It's that
simple _ and that big.
   I'm a man who sees life in terms of missions _ missions defined
and missions completed.
   And when I was a torpedo bomber pilot they defined the mission
for us. And before we took off, we all understood that no matter
what, you try to reach the target. And there have been other
missions for me _ Congress, and China, the CIA. But I'm here
tonight, and I am your candidate, because the most important work
of my life is to complete the mission we started in 1980.
(Applause).
   And how, and how do we complete it? We build on it.
   The stakes are high this year and the choice is crucial, for the
differences between the two candidates are as deep and wide as they
have ever been in our long history.
   Not only two very different men, but two very different ideas of
the future will be voted on this Election Day.
   And what it all comes down to is this: My opponent's view of the
world sees a long slow decline for our country, an inevitable fall
mandated by impersonal historical forces.
   But America is not in decline. America is a rising nation.
   He sees (applause), he sees America as another pleasant country
on the U.N. roll call, somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe. And
I see America as the leader _ a unique nation with a special role
in the world.
   And this has been called the American century, because in it we
were the dominant force for good in the world. We saved Europe,
cured polio, went to the moon, and lit the world with our culture.
And now we are on the verge of a new century, and what country's
name will it bear? I say it will be another American century.
   Our work is not done, our force is not spent.
   There are those, there are those who say there isn't much of a
difference this year. But America, don't let 'em fool ya.

   Two parties this year ask for your support. Both will speak of
growth and peace. But only one has proved it can deliver. Two
parties this year ask for your trust, but only one has earned it.
   Eight years ago, eight years ago, I stood here with Ronald
Reagan and we promised, together, to break with the past and return
America to her greatness. Eight years later, look at what the
American people have produced: the highest level of economic growth
in our entire history _ and the lowest level of world tensions in
more than 50 years.
   You know, some say this isn't an election about ideology, but
it's an election about competence. Well, it's nice of them to want
to play on our field. But this election isn't only about
competence, for competence is a narrow ideal.
   Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn't know where
they're going. (Applause). Competence, competence is the creed of
the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesn't for a
second understand the magic of the machine.
   The truth is (applause), the truth is, this election is about
the beliefs we share, the values we honor and the principles we
hold dear.
   But, but since someone brought up competence ...
   Consider the size of our triumph: A record number of Americans
at work, a record high percentage of our people with jobs, a record
high of new businesses, high rate of new businesses, a record high
rate of real personal income.
   These are facts. (Applause).
   And one way, and one way we know our opponents know the facts is
that to attack our record they have to misrepresent it. They call
it a Swiss cheese economy. Well, that's the way it may look to the
three blind mice. (Applause).
   But, but when they were in charge it was all holes and no
cheese. (Applause).
   Inflation _ you know the litany _ inflation was 13 percent when
we came in. We got it down to four. Interest rates, interest rates
were more than 21. We cut them in half. Unemployment, unemployment
was up and climbing, and now it's the lowest in 14 years.
   My friends, eight years ago this economy was flat on its back _
intensive care. And we came in and gave it emergency treatment: Got
the temperature down by lowering regulation, and got the blood
pressure down when we lowered taxes. And pretty soon the patient
was up, back on his feet, and stronger than ever.
   And now who do we hear knocking on the door but the same doctors
who made him sick. And they're telling us to put them in charge of
the case again? My friends, they're lucky we don't hit 'em with a
malpractice suit!

   We've created 17 million new jobs the past five years _ more
than twice as many as Europe and Japan combined. And they're good
jobs. The majority of them created in the past six years paid an
average _ average _ of more than $22,000 a year. And someone better
take a message to Michael: Tell him, tell him that we have been
creating good jobs at good wages. The fact is, they talk and we
deliver. (Applause).
   They promise and we perform.
   And there are millions of young Americans in their 20s who
barely remember (Applause), who barely remember the days of gas
lines and unemployment lines. And now they're marrying and starting
careers. To those young people I say, ``You have the opportunity
you deserve, and I'm not going to let them take it away from you.''
(Applause).
   The leaders, the leaders of the expansion have been the women of
America who helped create the new jobs, and filled two out of every
three of them. And to the women of America I say, ``You know better
than anyone that equality begins with economic empowerment. You're
gaining economic power, and I'm not going to let them take it away
from you.'' (Applause).
   There are millions, there are millions of older Americans who
were brutalized by inflation. We arrested it _ and we're not going
to let it out on furlough. (Applause).
   We're going, and we're going to keep the Social Security trust
fund sound, and out of reach of the big spenders. To America's
elderly I say, ``Once again you have the security that is your
right, and I'm not going to let them take it away from you.''
   I know the liberal Democrats are worried about the economy.
They're worried it's going to remain strong. And they're right, it
is _ with the right leadership it will remain strong.
   But let's be frank. Things aren't perfect in this country. There
are people who haven't tasted the fruits of the expansion. I've
talked to farmers about the bills they can't pay and I've been to
the factories that feel the strain of change. And I've seen the
urban children who play amidst the shattered glass and the
shattered lives. And, you know, there are the homeless. And you
know, it doesn't do any good to debate endlessly which policy
mistake of the '70s is responsible. They're there, and we have to
help them.
   But what we must remember if we're to be responsible and
compassionate is that economic growth is the key to our endeavors.
   I want growth that stays, that broadens, and that touches,
finally, all Americans, from the hollows of Kentucky to the sunlit
streets of Denver, from the suburbs of Chicago to the broad avenues
of New York, and from the oil fields of Oklahoma to the farms of
the Great Plains.
   And can we do it? Of course we can. We know how. We've done it.
If we, if we continue to grow at our current rate, we will be able
to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years.

   And we will do it _ by maintaining our commitment to free and
fair trade, by keeping government spending down, and by keeping
taxes down.
   Our economic life is not the only test of our success. One issue
overwhelms all the others, and that is the issue of peace.
   Look at the world on this bright August night. The spirit of
democracy is sweeping the Pacific rim. China feels the winds of
change. New democracies assert themselves in South America. And one
by one the unfree places fall, not to the force of arms but to the
force of an idea: freedom works. (Applause).
   And we, we have a new relationship with the Soviet Union. The
INF treaty, the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, the beginning of the end of the Soviet proxy war in
Angola, and with it the independence of Namibia. Iran and Iraq move
toward peace.
   It's a watershed. It is no accident.
   It happened when we acted on the ancient knowledge that strength
and clarity lead to peace _ weakness and ambivalence lead to war.
You see, you see, weakness tempts aggressors. Strength stops them.
I will not allow this country to be made weak again _ never.
   The tremors in the Soviet world continue. The hard earth there
has not yet settled. Perhaps what is happening will change our
world forever. And perhaps not. A prudent skepticism is in order.
And so is hope.
   But either way, we're in an unprecedented position to change the
nature of our relationship. Not by pre-emptive concession, but by
keeping our strength. Not by yielding up defense systems with
nothing won in return, but by hard, cool engagement in the tug and
pull of diplomacy. (Applause).
   My life, my life has been lived in the shadow of war _ I almost
lost my life in one.
   And I hate war. Love peace.
   And we have peace.
   And I am not going to let anyone take it away from us.
   Our economy is strong but not invulnerable, and the peace is
broad but can be broken. And now we must decide. We will surely
have change this year, but will it be change that moves us forward?
Or change that risks retreat?
   In 1940, when I was barely more than a boy, Franklin Roosevelt
said we shouldn't change horses in midstream.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: in midstream.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   My friends, these days the world moves even more quickly, and
now, after two great terms, a switch will be made. But when you
have to change horses in midstream, doesn't it make sense to switch
to one who's going the same way?
   An election that is about ideas and values is also about
philosophy. And I have one.
   At the bright center is the individual. And radiating out from
him or her is the family, the essential unit of closeness and of
love. For it is the family that communicates to our children _ to
the 21st century _ our culture, our religious faith, our traditions
and history.
   From the individual to the family to the community, and then on
out to the town, the church and the school, and, still echoing out,
to the county, the state, and the nation _ each doing only what it
does well, and no more. And I believe that power must always be
kept close to the individual, close to the hands that raise the
family and run the home.
   I am guided by certain traditions. One is that there is a God
and he is good, and his love, while free, has a self-imposed cost:
We must be good to one another.
   I believe in another tradition that is, by now, imbedded in the
national soul. It is that learning is good in and of itself. You
know, the mothers of the Jewish ghettoes of the east would pour
honey on a book so the children would know that learning is sweet.
And the parents who settled hungry Kansas would take their children
in from the fields when a teacher came. That is our history.
   And there is another tradition. And that is the idea of
community _ a beautiful word with a big meaning. Though liberal
Democrats have an odd view of it. They see ``community'' as a
limited cluster of interest groups, locked in odd conformity. And
in this view, the country waits passive while Washington sets the
rules.
   But that's not what community means _ not to me.
   For we are a nation of communities, of thousands and tens of
thousands of ethnic, religious, social, business, labor union,
neighborhood, regional and other organizations _ all of them
varied, voluntary and unique.
   This is America: the Knights of Columbus, the Grange, Hadassah,
the Disabled American Veterans, the Order of AHEPA, the Business
and Professional Women of America, the union hall, the Bible study
group, LULAC, ``Holy Name'' _ a brilliant diversity spread like
stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky.

   Does government have a place? Yes. Government is part of the
nation of communities _ not the whole, just a part.
   And I don't hate government. A government that remembers that
the people are its master is a good and needed thing.
   I respect old-fashioned common sense, and have no great love,
and I have no great love for the imaginings of the social planners.
You see, I like what's been tested and found to be true.
   For instance:
   Should public school teachers be required to lead our children
in the pledge of allegiance? My opponent says no _ and I say yes.
   Should society be allowed to impose the death penalty on those
who commit crimes of extraordinary cruelty and violence? My
opponent says no _ but I say yes.
   And should our children, should our children have the right to
say a voluntary prayer, or even observe a moment of silence in the
schools? My opponent says no _ but I say yes.
   And should free men and women have the right to own a gun to
protect their home? My opponent says no _ but I say yes.
   And is it right to believe in the sanctity of life and protect
the lives of innocent children? My opponent says no _ but I say
yes. You see, we must, we must change, we've got to change from
abortion to adoption. And let me tell you this: Barbara and I have
an adopted granddaughter. And the day of her christening we wept
with joy. I thank God that her parents chose life.
   I'm the one who believes it is a scandal to give a weekend
furlough to a hardened first-degree killer who hasn't even served
enough time to be eligible for parole.
   I'm the one who says a drug dealer who is responsible for the
death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment.
   And I'm the one who will not raise taxes. My opponent now says,
my opponent now says he'll raise them as a last resort, or a third
resort. Well, when a politician talks like that, you know that's
one resort he'll be checking into. And, my opponent won't rule out
raising taxes. But I will.
   And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no,
and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And I'll
say to them: Read my lips. No new taxes.
   Let me tell you more _ (crowd cheers and chants) _ let me tell
you more, let me just tell you more about the mission.
   On jobs, my mission is: 30 in 8. Thirty million jobs in the next
eight years.

   Every one of our children deserves a first-rate school. The
liberal Democrats want power in the hands of the federal
government. And I want power in the hands of the parents. And, I
will _ (crowd cheers) _ and I will, I will encourage merit schools.
I will give more kids a Head Start. And I'll make it easier to save
for college.
   I want a drug-free America _ and this will not be easy to
achieve. But I want to enlist the help of some people who are
rarely included. Tonight I challenge the young people of our
country to shut down the drug dealers around the world. Unite with
us, work with us.
   ``Zero tolerance'' isn't just a policy, it's an attitude. Tell
them what you think of people who underwrite the dealers who put
poison in our society. And while you're doing that, my
administration will be telling the dealers: whatever we have to do
we'll do, but your day is over, you're history.
   I am going to do whatever it takes to make sure the disabled are
included in the mainstream. For too long they've been left out. But
they're not going to be left out anymore.
   And I am going to stop ocean dumping. Our beaches should not be
garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools.
   And I am going to have the FBI trace the medical wastes and we
are going to punish the people who dump those infected needles into
our oceans, lakes and rivers. And we must clean the air. We must
reduce the harm done by acid rain.
   And I will put incentives back into the domestic energy
industry, for I know from personal experience there is no security
for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil.
   In foreign affairs I will continue our policy of peace through
strength. I will move toward further cuts in strategic and
conventional arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet
Union and the Eastern Bloc and NATO. I will modernize and preserve
our technological edge and that includes strategic defense.
   And a priority, a priority: Ban chemical and biological weapons
from the face of the Earth. That will be a priority with me.
   And I intend to speak for freedom, stand for freedom, be a
patient friend to anyone, east or west, who will fight for freedom.
   It seems to me the presidency provides an incomparable
opportunity for ``gentle persuasion.''
   And I hope to stand for a new harmony, a greater tolerance.
We've come far, but I think we need a new harmony among the races
in our country. And we're on a journey into a new century, and
we've got to leave that tired old baggage of bigotry behind.
   Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what
it's for. But they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth
is an end in itself.

   And there are those who have dropped their standards along the
way, as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top.
There's graft in city hall, and there's greed on Wall Street;
there's influence peddling in Washington, and the small corruptions
of everyday ambition.
   But you see, I believe public service is honorable. And every
time I hear that someone has breached the public trust it breaks my
heart.
   And I wonder sometimes if we have forgotten who we are. But
we're the people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin
called slavery _ and we're the people who rose from the ghettoes
and the deserts.
   And we weren't saints, but we lived by standards. We celebrated
the individual, but we weren't self-centered. We were practical,
but we didn't live only for material things. We believed in getting
ahead, but blind ambition wasn't our way.
   The fact is prosperity has a purpose. It is to allow us to
pursue ``the better angels,'' to give us time to think and grow.
Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it
concrete by certain acts of goodness.
   It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read
_ and I thank my wife Barbara for all her work in helping people to
read and all her work for literacy in this country.
   It means teaching troubled children through your presence that
there is such a thing as reliable love. Some would say it's soft
and insufficiently tough to care about these things. But where is
it written that we must act as if we do not care, as if we are not
moved?
   Well, I am moved. I want a kinder and gentler nation.
   Two men this year ask for your support. And you must know us.
   As for me, I have held high office and done the work of
democracy day by day. Yes, my parents were prosperous; and their
children sure were lucky. But there were lessons we had to learn
about life.
   John Kennedy discovered poverty when he campaigned in West
Virginia; there were children who had no milk. And young Teddy
Roosevelt met the new America when he roamed the immigrant streets
of New York. And I learned a few things about life in a place
called Texas.
   And when I _ (applause) _ and when I was, when I was working on
this part of the speech, Barbara came in and asked what I was
doing. And I looked up, and I said I'm working hard. And she said:
``Oh, dear, don't worry, relax, sit back, take off your shoes and
put up your silver foot.'' (Laughter, applause.)
   Now, we moved to West Texas 40 years ago _ 40 years ago this
year. The war was over, and we wanted to get out and make it on our
own. Those were exciting days. We lived in a little shotgun house,
one room for the three of us. Worked in the oil business, and then
started my own.
   And in time we had six children. Moved from the shotgun to a
duplex apartment to a house. And lived the dream _ high school
football on Friday nights, Little League, neighborhood barbecue.

   People don't see their own experience as symbolic of an era _
but of course we were.
   And so was everyone else who was taking a chance and pushing
into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car.
   But the big thing I learned is the satisfaction of creating
jobs, which meant creating opportunity, which meant happy families,
who in turn could do more to help others and enhance their own
lives.
   I learned that the good done by a single good job can be felt in
ways you can't imagine.
   It's been said that I'm not the most compelling speaker, and
there are actually those who claim that I don't always communicate
in the clearest, most concise way. But I dare them to keep it up _
go ahead: Make my 24-hour time period! (Laughter, applause,
chanting.)
   Well, I _ (as crowd chanting ending) _ I may be, may not be the
most eloquent, but I learned that, early on, that eloquence won't
draw oil from the ground.
   And I may sometimes be a little awkward. But there's nothing
self-conscious in my love of country.
   And I am a quiet man, but _ (applause) _ I am a quiet man, but I
hear the quiet people others don't. The ones who raise the family,
pay the taxes, meet the mortgage.
   And I hear them and I am moved, and their concerns are mine.
   A president must be many things.
   He must be a shrewd protector of America's interests; and he
must be an idealist who leads those who move for a freer and more
democratic planet.
   And he must see to it that government intrudes as little as
possible in the lives of the people; and yet remember that it is
right and proper that a nation's leader take an interest in the
nation's character.
   And he must be able to define _ and lead _ a mission.
   For 7{ years, I have worked with a great president _ I have seen
what crosses that big desk. I have seen the unexpected crisis that
arrives in a cable in a young aide's hand. And I have seen problems
that simmer on for decades and suddenly demand resolution. And I
have seen modest decisions made with anguish, and crucial decisions
made with dispatch.
   And so I know that what it all comes down to, this election _
what it all comes down to, after all the shouting and the cheers _
is the man at the desk. And who should sit at that desk.
   My friends, I am that man.
   (Applause, cheers, chanting.)
   I say it, I say it without boast or bavado.
   I've fought for my country, I've served, I've built _ and I will
go from the hills to the hollows, from the cities to the suburbs to
the loneliest town on the quietest street to take our message of
hope and growth for every American to every American.
   I will keep America moving forward, always forward, for a better
America, for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points of
light.
   This is my mission. And I will complete it.
   (Applause, cheers, chanting.)
   Thank you.
   (Cheering continues.)
   You know, you know it is customary to end an address with a
pledge or a saying that holds a special meaning. And I've chosen
one that we all know by heart. One that we all learned in school.
And I ask everyone in this great hall to stand and join me in this
_ we all know it _
   I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
   Thank you.

Dan Quayle of Indiana to the Republican National Convention on
Thursday night as he accepted the party's vice presidential
nomination.
   Thank you. Thank you very much. (He repeats his thanks several
times as the crowd cheers.)
   You're great. (He again repeats his thanks as the cheering

   Boy, I can see we're going to have a lot of fun in this campaign.
   Thank you very much.
   Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, I accept your
nomination for vice president of the United States of America.
   Just, just think, 82 days from now, George Bush and I are going
to win one for you, win one for America's future, and, yes, win one
for the Gipper.
   My friends, I am standing here tonight because of the decision
made by a great man and a great leader, George Bush.
   Two days ago, he asked me if I would join him as his running
mate. I am deeply grateful for George's confidence in me, and I am
humbled by the task ahead.
   I would like to add a very personal note. I am also standing
here tonight because of the decision my wife, Marilyn, and I made
nearly 16 years ago to be married. Marilyn and our children,
Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne, are my strength, my pride, my joy, my
love. They are and always will be my total life.
   Many this week have asked, who is Dan Quayle?
   The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.
   Since 1980, I have been a United States senator from Indiana _
and very proud of it. Before that, I was a member of the United
States House of Representatives _ and proud of it. And, as a young
man, I served six years in the National Guard, and, like millions
of Americans who have served in the Guard and who serve today _ and
I am proud of that.
   In Indiana, in Indiana they call us Hoosiers and if you saw the
movie ``Hoosiers'' you have a feeling of what life is like in small
towns of our state.
   My hometown of Huntington is a little bigger than the town in
the movie, and the high school I graduated from is a little bigger
than the one that fielded the basketball team in the film.

   Still, I identify with that movie, ``Hoosiers,'' because it
reflects the values I grew up with in our small town. We believe
very strongly in hard work, in getting an education, in offering an
opportunity to our families. Yes, we love basketball, we love
underdogs, but most important, we love our country.
   So tonight, so tonight, I am one humble Hoosier, whose efforts
to devote part of his life to public service have led him here.
   I would have been quite happy spending my life in Huntington, in
the newspaper business, watching my kids grow, seeing a community
with plenty of opportunity to go around. But I looked around me in
the mid-70s and I saw threats to the future of my family and to the
values that could once be taken for granted in our country.
   Beyond my town, there were communities torn by crime and drugs,
and there were neighborhoods where the very word ``opportunity''
didn't exist because there were no jobs.
   I decided to try to change these things: to make opportunity
replace despair, and to make the future just as good as the past
for the families of the many Huntingtons of great our land.
   That was 1976, when I was first elected to the House of
Representatives. But both houses of Congress and the White House in
the hands of liberal Democrats, it was a lot tougher than I ever
imagined to turn my determination into reality.
   In those Jimmy Carter years, the people running things thought
government was the answer, instead of part of the problem. They
thought high taxes and big spending would solve anything. I think
you know the rest. None of their policies worked and the American
people knew it.

   In 1980, they voted for a bold new course for the country; a
course that brought us more jobs for working Americans, more
security for a peace-loving people, more respect from friends and
foes around the globe, more opportunity for women and minorities,
and a renewed belief that America is a land where you can make your
dreams come true.
   The Reagan-Bush revolution has already been written on the pages
of history. Now, George Bush and Dan Quayle are going to add
several bold new chapters to the story of the greatest nation God
ever put on this Earth.
   When I think, when I think of America under the leadership of
George Bush, three words come to mind: Freedom. Family. And future.
   Freedom first, because without it, nothing else is possible.
   When I was a boy, my grandfather used to say to me _ and I say
it to you here tonight _ that America is the greatest nation on
Earth because America is free. This is true today and it will
always be true.
   Next, family. George Bush understands, you understand, I
understand, that the family has always been the very heart of
civilization. We know the importance of the family to a child
growing up. We know the help a family can be to a kid out of
school, out of hope, out of luck. And we know the importance of
family where one generation helps take care of another, young and
old.
   And then, there is the future. That word symbolizes hope and
opportunity. To make sure hope and opportunity are always there, we
need a strong economy so there will be good jobs for all who seek
them.

   We need an investment in our national defense that brings us
long-term security in the world.
   We do not need the future the Democratic Party sees, the party
of George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, (crowd boos) _
just wait, it gets better _ Ted Kennedy and, now, his buddy,
Michael Dukakis. That future has America in retreat. That future
has higher taxes and a guaranteed loss of job opportunities. And
that future has more government intervention in the lives of all of
us.
   The future under George Bush means peace and economic
opportunity for all.
   And, I can tell you, you have George Bush's track record to go
on. The tax cuts the Republicans have brought America have resulted
in 17 million new jobs being created.
   Let me tell you something: George Bush will not raise your
taxes, period.
   And let me tell you something else: Michael Dukakis will. He has
a track record, too, and that is what it tells us: Higher taxes.
   As the new jobs opened up during our current economic expansion,
not everyone had the necessary skills for them. Some had lost their
jobs and others could not find their first one.
   In 1983, the Job Training Partnership Act became law. I was the
author of that legislation, and I am proud of it. It established a
nationwide training program that has a partnership of government
and the private sector. Today, because of the Job Training
Partnership Act, hundreds of thousands of graduates of these
programs have jobs with a future.

   One of them is Pam Snyder-La Rue of Roy, Utah. A single parent
with four children, she was a high school dropout, and on welfare.
She joined a JTPA program. First, she earned her high school
equivalency credential. Then she earned an accounting certificate.
Today, she is a staff accountant at a vocational center. She is off
welfare, and proud to be making it on her own. She now has a future.
   We could not have a secure economy at home if we do not have a
peaceful and secure world. As a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, I know well that it is rebuilding our defense that
persuaded the Soviet Union to return to the negotiating table to
get us a treaty that, for the first time, actually reduces nuclear
arms.
   Today, our relationship with the Soviet Union is the best it has
been since the end of World War II. George Bush will keep it that
way, and I will be right there with him.
   Freedom is the most precious commodity our nation has. Let me
say again, all else rests on it. We have worked hard for more than
200 years to preserve freedom. In the Soviet Union, people are
trying to get out. In the United States, people are trying to get
in. Our freedom is the beacon that draws them.
   A great American novelist, the late Thomas Wolfe, once wrote,
``This is a fabulous country _ the only fabulous country. The one
where miracles not only happen, they happen all the time.''
   Miracles do happen all the time in America because we live in
freedom and because the energy and imagination of our people makes
their dreams come true every day.
   I am privileged to be the first person of my generation to be on
a national ticket. I don't presume to talk for everyone of my
generation, but I know that a great many will agree with me when I
express my thanks to the generation of George Bush for bringing us
to an era of peace and freedom and opportunity.
   My generation has a profound debt to them. We will pay it by
making sure that our children and the generations that follow will
have the same freedom, the same family values and a future bright
with opportunity for all.
   Thank you very much. Good night. God bless you. Let's go on to
victory.

   Officials at an art gallery say a
``sophisticated'' thief so carefully concealed the removal of
$500,000 in small Asian works during the Asian art curator's
vacation that staffers didn't realize they were gone.
   The curator, Hiram Woodward, discovered upon his return that
some 87 works were stolen during the vacation July 22 to Aug. 13,
said Walters Art Gallery Director Robert P. Bergman, who announced
the theft Thursday.
   Some of the objects had greater historical value to the museum
than monetary value, estimated at $500,000, Bergman said.
   ``Please don't confuse the monetary value with what is important
to us,'' Bergman said. ``Two of the pieces of porcelain were of
such detail and beauty, their thefts are crimes against our
cultural heritage.''
   Among the missing articles is the ``Peach Bloom Vase,'' an
18-inch porcelain vase dating to the 18th century, Bergman said.
   The artifacts were taken from locked Plexiglass cases on the
fourth floor of a separate wing of the museum, and the works that
were left behind were rearranged to prevent detection of the theft,
Bergman said. Staffers and patrons passed the displays without
noticing anything amiss, he added.
   Forty-seven ``major pieces'' of Asian art, primarily porcelain,
and 40 antique Chinese snuff bottles were taken, Bergman said at a
news conference.
   ``It was a very sophisticated and well planned sort of thing. It
was not obvious except to anyone who knows the collection piece by
piece,'' museum spokesman Howard White said.
   Woodward ``was walking around his galleries, as curators will
do, when he noticed pieces missing that he hadn't removed,''
Bergman said. ``He then checked with various departments who might
have removed them. When it was revealed that nobody had taken the
objects, he went back to the cases and it was evident that they had
been tampered with.''
   FBI Special Agent Rosemary Vicini said investigators could not
release any details of the investigation.
   A $100,000 reward has been offered by Lloyd's of London, the
underwriter for the museum's collection, for information that would
solve the theft.
   It was the first major theft at the gallery, which was one of
the greatest private art collections in the world when railroad
magnate Henry Walters bequeathed it to the city upon his death in
1931.

   Gay rights activists who staged a
demonstration to seek more federal money to fight AIDS were
denounced by a small group of young Republicans who chanted phrases
such as ``please go quick, you're all going to die.''
   The two sides traded slogans Thursday during a demonstration
outside the Louisiana Superdome, where the Republican National
Convention was held.
   Other protests on the last day of the convention included one
aimed at vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle and another by
Palestinians denouncing Israeli treatment.
   About 40 gay rights activists lined up outside a Superdome
entrance as delegates and guests arrived to hear a speech by GOP
presidential nominee George Bush.
   The demonstrators, many of them members of the New York
City-based group Act Up, carried signs bearing messages such as
``Don't abandon people with AIDS,'' and distributed leaflets.
   A group of about 15 young Republican men and women quickly
gathered and began shouting slogans such as ``please go quick,
you're all going to die'' and ``no equal rights for sodomites.''
   About 15 police officers then lined up between the demonstrators
and the counter-protesters as the gay rights activists shouted
back, ``Act up, fight back, fight AIDS.''
   Some conventioneers laughed as they passed by and many stopped
to take photographs.
   Act Up member Neil Broome of New York City said he held out hope
``there are Republicans who care.''
   Shortly before the AIDS protest, four other demonstrators held
up a 12-foot-long banner with the facetious message: ``Draft
Dodgers for Quayle.''
   Quayle was at the center of controversy Thursday over reports
that he used the influence of others to gain admittance to the
National Guard to avoid serving in Vietnam.
   ``If it's OK for the vice president to buy his way out of duty,
then it's OK for the poor to refuse to fight,'' said John Oswald,
31, of New Orleans.
   After the gay rights demonstration broke up, about 10 people
identifying themselves as Palestinian students gathered outside the
chain-link fence ringing the Superdome.
   A spokesman for the group, who identified himself as Ali Ahmed,
a student at the University of Houston, said the United States
needs to put pressure on the Israelis to end their violent tactics
on the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Kellogg Recalls Frosted Mini-Wheats With Too Much Vitamin A</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. has announced a 25-state
recall of about 29,000 boxes of Frosted Mini-Wheats Biscuits cereal
that may contain too much vitamin A and cause a burning sensation
in the mouth.
   The giant cereal maker also said Thursday it had withdrawn an
unspecified number of boxes of Rice Krispies cereal at distribution
points because they may contain ten times more iron than normal.
   The levels of vitamin A found in 16-ounce and 20-ounce boxes of
Frosted Mini-Wheats coded BC117 and BC118 with the expiration date
of Aug. 2, 1989, may cause short-term discomfort such as a burning,
tingling sensation in the mouth, but will not cause any major
health risks, company spokesman Joe Stewart said.
   The levels of iron found in Rice Krispies with the code dates
June 22-24, 1989, and the letter ``M'' are at 100 percent of the
U.S. recommended daily allowance, but would not produce any health
threat, Stewart said. The product normally contains 10 percent of
the U.S. RDA of iron.
   In both cases, the cereals may not taste right, Stewart said.
   Stewart said he knew of three or four complaints to the company
about the Frosted Mini-Wheats from Michigan consumers since
Wednesday. At least one consumer experienced a burning sensation
after eating the cereal.
   The cereal normally contains 25 percent of the U.S. RDA of
vitamin A, and some of the recalled boxes have contained as much as
four times that amount, Stewart said.
   The Detroit district of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
said it had been advised of the recall and the withdrawal.
   Kellogg advised consumers with the affected Frosted Mini-Wheats
not to eat any of the product and return the entire package top
with the code dates to the company.
   In the case of the Rice Krispies, the company stopped
distributing the affected product Aug. 10, but no consumer recall
will be ordered, Stewart said. He said any consumer dissatisfied
with the product may follow the directions listed on the box for
return of the product.
   The states affected by the recall of the Frosted Mini-Wheats
are: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Maryland, Montana,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Florida's education commissioner says
about 50 Indian schoolchildren can continue to leave their
reservation for public school in another county, where their
families feel they are more welcome.
   ``The students on the Brighton Reservation should be able to
choose,'' Education Commissioner Betty Castor said Thursday after
signing a rule that ended a three-month dispute between two rural
districts hankering for the students.
   The precedent-setting decision came from Tallahassee, the state
capital, because the school districts, Okeechobee and Glades,
failed to reach an agreement. The state has never been called in to
settle a local territorial dispute, Castor said.
   Glades asked Castor to issue a ruling earlier this month as the
end of summer vacation approached. Both counties open schools
Monday.
   Ever since a dispute over what the Seminole tribe said was the
unfair disciplining of an Indian boy at a Glades County school
seven years ago, most families on the reservation have sent their
children 28 miles to Okeechobee Countty.
   They say they feel more welcome and get a better education than
in Glades County, where the reservation is located.
   Glades County, which has the smallest of Florida's 67 school
districts, decided in May it wanted Seminole children on the
reservation to attend school there, at least until the fourth
grade. Enrollment in Glades schools has declined in the last
decade, which means declining revenue.
   Castor said her decision was in the best interest of the
students.
   ``They have traditionally attended Okeechobee (schools), and it
is the clear choice of the students involved and of the Seminole
Indian tribe,'' she said.
   About 140 schoolchildren from the reservation have attended
Okeechobee schools since 1981, while only 20 Brighton youngsters
choose to go to Glades County schools.
   Jim Shore, an attorney for the Florida Seminole tribe, said
Thursday he could not comment on Castor's ruling until the tribe
got official notification.

<HEAD>New Research Suggests Dangers From Lower Levels Of Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While nerve disorders and other serious effects
of lead poisoning in children have become rare, new research
indicates that millions could face risks because of blood-lead
levels previously believed safe.
   ``Lead poisoning is still a problem in kids in this country,''
said Dr. Frank Mitchell, a specialist with the Centers for Disease
Control.
   The CDC on Thursday said screening for lead in children in
high-risk areas and reduction of lead in gasoline, air and food
have greatly reduced lead poisoning effects such as nerve disorders
and kidney damage.
   But the agency said long-term effects of lead exposure ``are
increasingly being observed ... with lead levels much lower than
previously believed harmful.''
   ``The numbers of children exposed to lead at these new lower
levels of concern ... are estimated at several million,'' the CDC
said in its weekly report, summarizing findings in a report to
Congress by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry.
   Low levels of lead exposure have been linked to learning
disabilities in children, while exposure to greater amounts can
lead to brain damage and death.
   As late as 1985, federal health officials reported that a
blood-lead level of anything less than 25 micrograms per deciliter
was regarded as safe. A 1985 screening program found that 1.5
percent of the children checked had elevated blood-lead levels by
that standard.
   But in recent years, many scientists have come to believe that
even 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood can have harmful,
long-term effects, Mitchell said.
   Last December, scientists reported that blood-lead levels of 12
micrograms were linked to a slight hearing loss in children, which
could cause learning impairment.
   The study, by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health
Effects Research Laboratory at North Carolina's Research Triangle
Park, also found that same blood-lead level could cause delays of
up to three months in sitting, walking and talking by young
children.
   Children, with immature bodies and a habit of getting into dust,
dirt and grime, are at greatest risk for adverse effects from lead
poisoning. Pregnant women also can transmit lead exposures to a
fetus.
   Lead residue in soil and dust ``is still a major problem,''
Mitchell said. ``That's the one we know less on how to go about
cleaning it up. ... You can't just pick up all the dirt and cart it
somewhere.''
   Lead paint in older housing units and lead in the dust and soil
from past deposits and deterioration ``will be difficult and
expensive to remedy,'' the CDC said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating methods to
remove lead from dust and soil, Mitchell said.
   A threat also remains from walls painted with lead-based paint
many years ago, if they are not either specially sealed or properly
stripped, he said. This must be done carefully by experts, he added.
   ``The worst thing you can do is just try to sand it off,'' he
said.

   A gun battle with suspected drug
traffickers erupted as soldiers neared a ranch outside this border
city, leaving four men dead and at least five wounded, including
two Mexican marines, authorities said.
   Marines from the coastal city of Ensenada were on routine foot
patrol along the coast Thursday morning when they were fired upon
as they approached the ranch, said Ramon Del Cid, a commander of
the Baja California Judicial Police.
   The 22 marines returned fire and called in support from the
Mexican army and local, state and federal police, authorities said.
   Police sources told The Tribune of San Diego that the shootout
occurred as the marines either raided or prepared to raid the ranch.
   Those at the ranch may have been tipped off about the raid,
triggering the shootout, police told the newspaper. Seven AK-47
assault rifles, pistols and ammunition were recovered by the
government troops, a Mexican television station reported.
   A federal police commander who declined to be identified told
The Associated Press that the incident was believed to be
drug-related but refused to elaborate.
   Del Cid said all of the dead were suspected narcotics
traffickers.
   However, a reporter for the newspaper ABC said that four Baja
California state judicial police agents were killed. He put the
number of wounded at six, including two Mexican army soldiers and
two civilians.
   The wounded marines, identified as Jesus Garcia Salinas, 23, and
Jorge Garcia Villanueva, 20,were listed in stable condition after
being transported from a Tijuana hospital to the Naval Hospital in
Ensenada, said Dr. Ariel Perez Munoz.
   Among those reported dead was Ramon Donato Delaerran Rivas, the
18-year-old son of the ranch owner, whose identity was given as
Ramon Donato Delaerran, 52, of Tijuana. Donato Delaerran was
reported wounded.
   Also killed were Lamberto Castro Gonzalez, 32, Gregorio Fuentes
Garcia, 40, and an unidentified 28-year-old man, authorities said.
   People in the neighborhood surrounding the ranch said Fuentes
Garcia was a former police officer from Durango and was known
locally as ``the commandante,'' reported XEWT-TV, a Mexican
television station.
   Tijuana police sources told the San Diego Union that Fuentes
Garcia had been charged with, but never tried for, the 1980 slaying
of a policeman in Rosarito, a seaside community south of Tijuana,
who was suspected of underworld connections.
   A judicial police official interviewed by The Associated Press
said that no drugs were recovered as a result of the 6:30 a.m. raid
of the ranch. The ranch is about nine miles south of Tijuana.

<HEAD>Depression, Anxiety May Cause More Chronic Fatigue Than Disease,
Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic fatigue can be as disabling as a heart
attack, but it may stem more from depression and anxiety than from
any physical cause, a new study indicates.
   In a report in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Kurt Kroenke, assistant chief of medicine at
Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, said many
doctors don't take chronic fatigue seriously enough.
   Such fatigue, which he compared to lower back pain, can result
in impairment in day-to-day activities resembling that in people
recovering from a heart attack or suffering from other serious
diseases.
   ``Fatigue tends to be underestimated many times in the
physician's mind as a minor complaint,'' Kroenke said Thursday.
``Fatigue is a symptom that doesn't affect the patients' lifespan,
but it causes a lot of disability.''
   Kroenke and his colleagues said 24 percent of 1,159 adults who
answered questionnaires at base clinics in 1986 identified fatigue
as a major problem.
   He and his colleagues conducted further studies on 102 people
who complained of fatigue lasting at least 30 days but had no
identifiable illnesses.
   Fifty-seven of them showed evidence of depression on
psychosocial and physical tests, while 58 of them had scores
suggesting abnormal levels of anxiety, and a total of 82 people _
80 percent of the group _ had one or both.
   In a comparison group of 26 people who had suffered no chronic
fatigue, only three people, or 12 percent, showed abnormal levels
of anxiety or depression, the researchers reported.
   They said a cause-and-effect relationship doesn't necessarily
exist between fatigue and anxiety or depression, because fatigue
could result from an unrecognized illness. But the ``consistent and
powerful findings'' on psychological tests, combined with an
absence of significant differences in lab tests between fatigued
and non-fatigued groups, ``indicate that emotional factors play a
role in chronic fatigue,'' they said.
   Therapy for fatigue sufferers could include reassurance,
counseling, psychoactive drugs and exercise, they said.
   The study did not explore the possible connection between
tiredness and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes
mononucleosis and has been suspected as a cause of chronic fatigue.
   But another study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association found a test for Epstein-Barr virus ``not helpful'' in
determining the cause of chronic tiredness, said authors led by Dr.
Walter Hellinger of the Mayo Clinic's facility in Jacksonville, Fla.
   They found no significant differences between 30 fatigued
patients who tested high for levels of a substance indicating the
presence of Epstein-Barr virus and 30 fatigued subjects who the
test revealed had low levels of the same substance.
   One co-author, Dr. Robert Van Scoy of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., noted the study did not deal with all tests for
Epstein-Barr, but just with the test for the early antigen, or
indicator, of the virus.
   Other researchers had reported in 1985 they found the
early-antigen test ``very useful'' in establishing the link between
the virus and chronic fatigue.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns N.J.'s 39-Year-Old Ban On Self-Service Gas
Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS G. KATSARELAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey's 39-year-old law banning
motorists from pumping their own gas has been overturned by a
Superior Court judge, who said the safety considerations that led
to the law's enactment are now invalid.
   But Judge Martin L. Haines suspended his ruling for six months
to give the Legislature an opportunity to enact regulations
complying with his decision.
   Oregon is the only other state that prohibits self-service
stations.
   Proponents of self-service stations praised the decision, which
was announced Thursday. They said it could help drive down costs at
the pump by decreasing labor expenses.
   ``We're obviously pleased,'' said John F. Holtz, associate
director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council, which represents the
state's largest oil companies. ``We see it as a victory for
consumer freedom of choice.''
   But Jerry Ferrara, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline
Retailer's Association and Allied Trades Inc., which represents
about 3,000 service stations in New Jersey, said he was
disappointed.
   The trade group said such a decision would lead to service
station layoffs and the closing of gas station repair bays.
   The state Department of Labor has lobbied against changing the
law, citing the possibility of fewer gas station jobs.
   Other opponents said the change would increase profits of
gasoline companies by lowering their labor costs.
   In his six-page opinion, Haines said the law violates the state
constitution because it exceeds the police power of the Legislature.
   Haines' ruling came on a lawsuit filed by Kirschner Brothers Oil
Co. Inc. of Haverford, Pa. The company, which owns about 20 service
stations in New Jersey, claimed the law is antiquated and that
customers ought to have a choice between self- and full-service.
   The 1949 statute, enacted primarily as a safety measure, was
affirmed by the state Supreme Court in 1952. Legislators who passed
the law were concerned that motorists would be in danger if they
pumped their own gas.
   Opponents of self-service stations cite newspaper reports of
fires and other accidents that have injured or killed motorists who
were trying to pump their own gas as evidence why the statute
should remain.
   Haines ruled June 29 that he couldn't overturn a law affirmed by
a higher court. But Kirschner asked that he reconsider, and, in his
latest ruling, Haines agreed.
   ``The principle is that a lower court is bound by precedent. In
this case, it does not apply because the facts have changed,'' the
judge said.
   Haines decided that safety is no longer an issue and that that
allows him to reverse his earlier ruling and overturn the state
Supreme Court's affirmation.
   ``The testimony before me revealed very different facts _
self-service stations are at least as safe as full-service
stations,'' Haines said in a telephone interview.
   The lawsuit was filed against the Labor Department, which was
represented by the attorney general's office. Becky Taylor, a
spokeswoman for Attorney General Cary Edwards, said the office had
not determined whether it would appeal.

<HEAD>Man With AIDS Sentenced To 99 Years In Prison For Attacking Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury sentenced a man infected with the AIDS
virus to 99 years in prison for sexually assaulting an 8-year-old
girl and then stabbing her.
   Alphonso Percival Darden, 27, said ``it was a setup'' as he was
led from the Harris County courtroom Thursday. He was watched by
angry relatives and friends of the victim, now 9, and her playmate,
now 10, who also was raped.
   Although Darden was charged in both assaults, he was tried only
in the case involving the younger girl.
   Authorities revealed that although Darden tested positive for
AIDS antibodies, the parents of the victims were not notified of
the AIDS risk for eight months.
   The girls testified that Darden got into their apartment Jan. 29
by posing as a security guard, sexually assaulted each of them
while forcing the other to watch, and then stabbed them.
   The victims said they escaped further injury by ``playing dead.''
   Darden said in a statement to police that the girls allowed him
to enter their apartment and then seduced him.
   Prosecutor Pat Kelley said the statement was ``so preposterous''
and harmful to the defense that he read it to the jury during
closing arguments.
   Kelley asked for a life sentence, saying it was necessary so
``little girls in the future will be safe.''
   Darden was arrested three days after the attacks. State District
Judge Michael McSpadden ordered him to take the antibody test and
said the results would be released to the parents.
   A positive result in the AIDS antibody test means a person was
exposed to the virus and may be infectious.
   Police said Darden may have raped six other Houston girls, whose
parents also don't know Darden was infected with the deadly virus.
   Vague Texas laws were blamed for the failure to notify the
parents about Darden's test result. Judges may order rape suspects
to be tested for the AIDS virus, but what action is taken
concerning the results is not clearly defined.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the guerrilla
movement seeking independence for South-West Africa says he
believes South Africa is sincerely committed to ending its rule
over the territory.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South-West African People's
Organization, made his comments in an interview with the Argus News
Service published Thursday in the South African company's
newspapers.
   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 for independence in
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. South Africa announced
earlier this month that it would begin implementation of a U.N.
independence plan for Namibia if agreement was reached on
withdrawal of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola.
   Nujoma was quoted as saying his guerrillas will observe a
cease-fire in Namibia starting Sept. 1 and thereafter will fight
only in self-defense.
   ``Let us believe that this time, the South African government is
serious,'' he reportedly said.
   According to the report, Nujoma made a major concession by
saying SWAPO would not delay the peace process by insisting that an
independent Namibia take possession of Walvis Bay, a South African
enclave which is only major port serving the territory.
   Nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the African
National Congress, the main guerrilla movement fighting for
black-majority rule in South Africa, to maintain bases in Namibia.
   SWAPO is widely considered the likely winner of independence
elections envisioned under the U.N. independence plan.
   Nujoma, interviewed in Zambia, was quoted as saying a SWAPO
government might adopt a one-party socialist system if there was
sufficient public backing. But he reportedly said there would not
be sweeping expropriation of private property.
   South African President P.W. Botha, in a policy speech Thursday,
endorsed the peace initiative but said his government would insist
that the United Nations prove its impartiality before independence
elections could proceed in Namibia.

   Former President Ferdinand Marcos
said today he will ask to come home to defend himself when a former
government minister testifies against him about the awarding of
allegedly questionable contracts.
   On Thursday, an anti-graft court ruled that the ousted president
had the right to be present when former public works secretary
Baltazar Aquino _ who is not related to President Corazon Aquino _
gives his deposition.
   The hearing Nov. 7 is not a trial but a ``perpetuation
proceeding'' to take testimony from Aquino, who court officials say
is gravely ill.
   Aquino is to testify about allegedly questionable contracts
granted to firms during Marcos' 20-year reign. Under Philippine
law, his testimony can be used against Marcos at a future trial,
even if the former secretary is dead.
   Justice Augusto Amores said Marcos could appear personally or be
represented by counsel and would have the right to cross-examine
Aquino. Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez said his office believed
``that his (Marcos) personal presence is not necessary'' during the
hearing.
   Marcos told reporters by telephone from Hawaii, where he lives
in exile, that he had not been informed officially of the Thursday
ruling.
   ``I directed my lawyer to seek the court order for me to come
home and defend myself in the proceedings. I want to represent
myself,'' said Marcos, who is a lawyer.
   Marcos has lived in Hawaii since his ouster in a 1986
civilian-military uprising. Mrs. Aquino has refused to let him
return, citing security concerns.
   But a spokesman for Mrs. Aquino quoted her as saying she would
``respect the decision of the court,'' even if it meant allowing
Marcos to come home.
   The court said Marcos had the constitutional right to appear
during the proceedings ``which cannot be denied to him in the
absence of more cogent reasons.''
   Marcos has never been formally charged with any criminal
offense, despite allegations of wrongdoing during his time in
office. Marcos has previously warned he would dismiss his lawyer,
Rafael Recto, and demand the right to represent himself if any
criminal charges were filed.
   In Thursday's ruling, the court authorized the Philippine consul
in Honolulu to serve notice of the proceedings to Marcos and to
publish the announcement in newspapers there for three consecutive
weeks.
   Marcos told Manila reporters that his former minister had been
pressured into agreeing to testify because of his poor health.
   Last May, Mrs. Aquino turned down a request by Marcos to return
here for the burial of his mother, Josefa, who died May 4.
   The body of Marcos' mother remains unburied as his supporters
agitate for the former president's return. Marcos said his mother's
burial would be ``my first duty'' after his return.

<TEXT>
   A Canadian businessman seeking to buy the
PTL ministry's assets has put down $1 million toward the $113
million deal.
   ``The only reason Peter Thomas won't own it is if somebody comes
in with a higher offer,'' Thomas said Thursday.
   Earlier this month, he and PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
signed an agreement giving Thomas until Sept. 16 to decide whether
he wanted the assets. Those include the PTL satellite TV network
and the Heritage USA Christian retreat near Fort Mill, S.C.
   ``By Sept. 1, it's either a deal or it's not a deal,'' Thomas
said. ``I'm going back to Canada ... I'll be back down here when I
get a call from the trustee saying that my offer's been accepted.''
   Thomas did not elaborate on the conditions he had sought.
   Benton has set a Sept. 1 deadline to receive offers. So far,
Charlotte businessman George Shinn and deposed PTL leader Jim
Bakker have said they plan to submit bids, although Shinn said this
week he might change his mind.
   Next, Benton would recommend a proposal for U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds' approval. PTL must sell its assets to pay
debts, which might be as much as $130 million.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987. In March
1987, Bakker resigned as PTL's president in a sex-and-money scandal.
   Thomas is offering $46 million in cash, including the $1 million
deposit, with the rest financed over five years.
   Pending court approval of Thomas's offer, PTL will pay him
interest on his $1 million at the prime interest rate, plus 2
percentage points. Currently, that totals 12 percent.
   If Thomas canceled his offer, the $1 million would become a
six-month loan to PTL at the same interest rate.

   Three Soviet sailors said they were tortured while
Taiwan held them in prison for 34 years, Tass reported. But a
Taiwanese official said the sailors requested political asylum and
were not held in jail.
   The official Tass news agency said Vladimir Sablin, Boris
Pisanov and Vladimir Kniga returned to the Soviet Union on
Thursday. They were crewmen of the tanker ship Tuapse, which Tass
said was captured by Taiwan July 23, 1954, while on its way to
mainland China with a cargo of kerosene.
   The news agency said 29 crew members were released in 1955 and
five more the following year, but that the three were held.
   ``What the Soviet seamen had to go through during that time can
be epitomized only in one word _ horror,'' Tass said.
   ``They were made to look for days at hot white electric bulbs,
wild dances of the prison guards on prostrate bodies of the
prisoners, whose feet and arm joints were squeezed tight,'' Tass
said. It gave no details on why the men were detained or what led
to their release.
   Tass said the three men arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport
``gray-haired with worry and grief,'' and were conspicuous because
of their old clothes and constrained manner.
   In Taiwan, a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of
anonymity said the three sailors did not spend their years in jail.
He said they requested political asylum in Taiwan and were treated
as refugees.
   The official declined further comment.
   Taiwan newspapers, quoting unidentified sources, said the three
sailors lived in a secluded compound guarded by security agents in
Ilan, a fishing village 20 miles southwest of the capital Taipei.
   In April, Tsai Chung-han, a parliamentarian of the governing
Nationalist Party, asked the government to allow the seamen to
return to the Soviet Union to visit their families after Taiwan
adopted a policy permitting restricted contacts with communist
countries.
   The late Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and his
supporters fled the Chinese mainland to the island of Taiwan in
1949 when communists led by Mao Tse-tung took power. The
Nationalists established a staunchly anti-communist government on
Taiwan. Taiwan has no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

books written by close associates of President Ronald Reagan. One
thing runs through all of them: Those with a long career in the

the Reagan revolution, his troops appeared less coherent and more
contradictory than could have been imagined under the dominion of
the charismatic president. Bush immediately understood the
spreading mood and felt a faint sense of abandon, the subtle
anguish of one who, used to victory, now fears loss, and cannot
adapt himself to the idea.''
   _ La Stampa of Turin (moderate): ``George Bush got ready
yesterday to present to America his `agenda for the future,' taking
himself away, for the first time after eight years, from the
protective but suffocating embrace of Reagan. ... The `New Bush'
has presented himself to the electorate as decisive, captivating
and almost charismatic.''

battlefront and found himself in the National Guard of his state,
Indiana, a local militia. ... The affair came at the worst moment

<HEAD>Shultz Stops in Cairo, Coveys Reagan Message to Mubarak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan sent a message to President
Hosni Mubarak reaffirming the U.S. commitment to help achieve an
overall Arab-Israeli peace settlement, a senior Egyptian official
said today.
   Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's top political adviser, said the message
was brought by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who stopped in
Cairo today on his way to Pakistan. Shultz spent 70 minutes at
Cairo International Airport, where el-Baz met him. The two men
talked in the airport's VIP lounge.
   ``Mr. Shultz asked me to convey to President Mubarak a verbal
message from President Reagan stating the commitment of the United
States to press ahead with efforts to bring a comprehensive and
just peace to the (Middle East) region,'' el-Baz told reporters
after Shultz left for Pakistan.
   Since mediating the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, the
United States has been trying without success to initiate
Arab-Israeli negotiations on an overall settlement.
   Shultz made four trips to the Middle East this year but failed
to win acceptance of a U.S. peace proposal. The plan called for an
international conference as an opening to direct Arab-Israeli talks.
   The secretary, who will represent Reagan at Saturday's funeral
of Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, made no statements
after meeting with el-Baz.
   In addition to the Arab-Israeli conflict, el-Baz said he and
Shultz also discussed the situation in Lebanon and efforts to end
the Iran-Iraq war.
   A U.N.-supervised, cease-fire between the two warring countries
is to go into effect at dawn Saturday.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Taking Its Toll Nationwide</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 5th graf, `The deaths ...' with resident

   An investigation into the deaths of five elderly Boston
residents during the heat wave found no problems with their
building's ventilation system, while in Illinois the summer's
torrid stranglehold claimed its 40th victim.
   Twenty-three cities in nine states set or tied temperature
records for the date Thursday, the National Weather Service
reported. But forecasters promised that a cooling trend was on the
way in several areas as residents cast about, sometimes
desperately, for ways to beat the heat.
   H.M. Hines, who owns Home Ice and Coal Co. in Raleigh, N.C.,
said the 105-degree weather there was bad enough that some people
had asked him to dump blocks of ice into their swimming pools.
   ``But it's not a good idea,'' Hines said. ``Somebody jumps in
and hits that 300-pound block of ice, it's dangerous.''
   The deaths in Massachusetts occurred between Aug. 4 and Monday,
a period when temperatures soared into the 90s. State Medical
Examiner Bryan Blackbourne said the clustering of the deaths in the
same place and during a short time led him to conclude heat was a
contributing factor. Four of the victims lived on the top floor of
the eight-story building.
   ``It was 90 degrees to 95 degrees outside and I would say easily
100 degrees inside,'' said Frank Frenna, 72, who also lived on the
top floor of the building but kept cool with a window air
conditioner.
   On Thursday, a Boston Housing Authority investigation found the
12 exhaust fans on the flat-topped roof were operating properly and
little variation in hallway temperatures from floor to floor, said
housing authority spokesman Bill Wright.
   Illinois authorities said an 85-year-old Danville man died of
heat stroke and reported his body temperature was 105 degrees when
he was found in his home. They said he had no air conditioner and
his doors and windows closed.
   In Chicago, Cook County officials said the county's death toll
from the summer heat stood at 40. Most of the victims were elderly.
   In Peoria, meanwhile, a day-care center was closed after state
public health officials found 95-degree temperatures indoors.
   The prolonged heat and humidity also threatened wildlife,
especially birds on Illinois' endangered species list.
   William E. Southern, a professor of biological sciences at
Northern Illinois University, said dozens of marshes and wetlands
in the state have dried up, leaving waterfowl nowhere to nest,
breed or feed.
   Elsewhere, the record-breaking temperatures kept air
conditioners at full cry and activity at a minimum.
   The 105-degree reading at Raleigh-Durham International Airport
tied the previous all-time record high set on July 23, 1952.
   At normally cool Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina, the
mercury hit 81 degrees, breaking the old record of 76 set 20 years
ago.
   Catherine Morton, news director for the mountain, said the heat
was affecting more than just people.
   ``A neighbor was out hiking and decided to take a dip in one of
the local streams,'' she said. ``When she looked up, there was a
wild bear in the pond up above her. Everybody's looking to cool
off.''
   About half of Kentucky's 178 school districts had planned to
open by week's end, but one school district's superintendent, Larry
Ryle, said if temperatures remain as high, ``I'll declare a heat
emergency and close them down.''
   In New York City, the collapse earlier this week of a carriage
horse working in 90-degree-plus weather created a public furor and
prompted Mayor Edward I. Koch to announce some changes.
   Koch said Thursday the city will provide more watering holes in
Central Park, move a horse ambulance there and provide shade in hot
weather. He also called for review of a regulation that requires
horses to return to the stable when the temperature hits 90 degrees.
   The changes, he said, ``make good old-fashioned horse sense.''
   Meanwhile, a cold front moved across central and eastern parts
of the nation today, lowering temperatures and scattering rain and
thunderstorms.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s from the Great Lakes into
New England and along the Pacific Coast and in the 80s or 90s
across much of the rest of the nation.

   A man shot his girlfriend to death
and killed himself, while the woman's children and sisters fled the
home by tying bedsheets together and climbing out of an upstairs
window, authorities said.
   Police were called to the house Thursday morning by a neighbor
who heard shots and spotted one of the children on the roof, said
sheriff's Lt. Robert Johnson.
   When police arrived, they broke into the house and found the two
bodies and recovered a shotgun, Johnson said.
   The dead were identified as Patty Sam, 29, and Kevin Rodd, 28,
who neighbors said had been living together in the house.
   Sam's 10-year-old son, Steven, apparently witnessed the shooting
and ran upstairs to warn his sister Emily, 6, and Sam's sisters,
Theresa, 13, and Jackie, 24, Johnson said.
   Jackie Sam said she was awakened by the children screaming.
   ``Steven goes, `He shot my mom! He shot my mom!,''' Ms. Sam
said. She said her sister's other child, 8-year-old Amanda, was not
at home when the shooting occurred.
   The four escaped unharmed by climbing down sheets they tied
together, Johnson said.
   Police had been called to the home before because of the
couple's fights.
   ``There's been a lot of arguments between the two of them,''
said neighbor Darlene Moore.
   ``When they fought, it looked pretty serious,'' said Dawn
Taylor, another neighbor.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today said
workers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk will join striking coal
miners and dockworkers unless the government legalizes the trade
union, a spokesman said.
   The union's national executive commission later called on its
members to support the strikers, who have closed six mines in
southwestern Poland and shut down docks and public transportation
in Szczecin, according to a labor leader.
   ``They (the strikers) are fighting for our common cause,'' said
the commission statement, read by Jacek Kuron, a senior union
adviser in Warsaw. ``Experience teaches us that only wise social
pressure can lead the authorities to the road of economic and
social reconstruction.''
   The strikes, which began Tuesday, are demanding Solidarity's
legalization, higher pay and improved working conditions.
   Workers at a coal mine in the Silesia region today joined the
strike. Solidarity spokesman Adam Kowalczyk said about 1,000 miners
were occupying the 30th Anniversary of the People's Poland Mine.
Other strikers occupied mines in Andaluzja, Moszczenica, Morcinek
and two plants near Jastrzebie.
   Walesa told a rally in Gdansk that shipyard workers there are
prepared to stop work Monday if the strikers' demands are not met,
a union spokesman said.
   A strike by workers at the shipyard eight years ago led to
nationwide labor unrest that spawned Solidarity. The union existed
legally for 15 months before being suppressed in a military
crackdown in 1981 and outlawed the next year.
   The Gdansk shipyard workers also went on strike in May in
support of steel workers who had shut down operations at a huge
steel mill near Krakow.
   Slawomir Majewski, a Solidarity activist in Gdansk, said by
telephone that Walesa's call for a sympathy strike was met with
applause from 500 workers attending the rally.
   Majewski said they chanted, ``There is no freedom without
Solidarity!''
   The strikes began Tuesday when miners occupied the July
Manifesto mine near Jastrzerbie, in southwestern Poland.
   In Szczecin, Poland's second largest port, transportation
workers stopped work Thursday, joining dockworkers in the city.
   The state-run PAP news agency estimated that 70,000 tons of coal
had gone unmined as a result of the miners' strikes, resulting in a
loss of more than $1.7 million. It has denounced the strikes as
illegal.
   All the mines are in Silesia, the rich mining region of
southwestern Poland, and are major producers of high-grade export
coal. Together, they employ more than 40,000 workers.
   Solidarity activists estimated that 10,100 miners joined the
strikes. They said 5,000 strikers occupied the July Manifesto mine.
A management spokesman put the July Manifesto figure at 800-900.
   In Szczecin, 600 bus drivers and other employees of the
municipal transport service walked off the job. PAP said the
walkout stopped normal bus service and forced authorities to lease
buses to aid stranded commuters.
   About 2,000 Szczecin dockworkers were on strike, said Solidarity
spokesman Wojciech Maziarski.
   Czeslaw Czerwiec, a spokesman for July Manifesto strikers, said
security forces were hampering efforts by supporters and relatives
to bring food into the mine.
   Witnesses described the scene as tense, with police still
holding positions around the mine's entrances. A regional leader of
Solidarity, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, was picked up by police in Wroclaw
on Thursday night, union activists said.
   Miners are paid more than twice the national average but say
Poland's 60 percent inflation and nationwide price increases of 40
percent this year make it impossible to get by.
   Coal resources are crucial to the nation's economy. Poland is
the world's fourth-largest exporter of coal and the mining
operations are essential to its steel, power and shipbuilding
industries.
   The strikes have surpassed the number of actions that broke out
in April and May, the worst labor unrest in the country since the
1981 martial-law crackdown. However it appeared that a smaller
number of workers were on strike than in April and May.
   The spring strikes, in which workers also demanded legalization
of Solidarity and wage increases, ended inconclusively after police
broke up one strike and striking shipyard workers gave up without a
settlement.

   A government minister said today that
sabotage was almost certainly the cause of a fiery plane crash that
killed President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and U.S. Ambassador Arnold
Raphel.
   But a government information officer discounted all speculation
on the cause of the explosion and crash, which also killed 28
others.
   The country, meanwhile, was preparing for Zia's funeral,
scheduled Saturday at the world's largest mosque, Faisal Masjid. A
grave was dug for him today on the lawn in front of the mosque.
   Across the border in India, authorities lifted curfews in two
towns on the India-Pakistan border after police clashed with
Moslems protesting Zia's death.
   India, which is mainly Hindu, and Pakistan, which is Moslem, are
long-time adversaries and have fought three wars since they both
gained independence from Britain in 1947.
   Police and paramiltary forces continued to enforce a curfew in
the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, a strategic state claimed
by both countries, officials said. Many Moslems in the region
support the Pakistani claim and admired Zia, who earlier this year
put his country under Islamic law.
   Security forces today fired warning shots in the air to disperse
crowds that violated the restrictions, but no one was hurt, they
said. On Thursday, police killed four Moslems and wounded more than
100 others trying to set fire to Hindu homes, shops and temples.
   Pakistan's minister of communications and railways, Aslam
Khattak, told reporters that sabotage was ``a 1,000 percent
certainty'' as the cause of the military transport plane crash. He
did not elaborate.
   But a government information officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, discounted all speculation on the cause, including a
newspaper report that a time bomb was hidden in a basket of mangoes
aboard the plane. ``Nothing is known yet,'' he said. ``The
investigators are still at the scene.''
   ``Rumors About Blast Cause'' was the headline in the
English-language opposition daily, The Muslim. ``All sorts of
reports and rumors are circulating in the federal capital in the
absence of an authentic official regarding the crash,'' it wrote.
   The moderate non-government daily, The Nation, asked in a
front-page headline, ``Who eliminated Zia and why?'' It said
unnamed civilian aviation experts ``surmise'' there must have been
an explosive device aboard because the C-130 is known as a sturdy,
reliable aircraft.
   The protocol section of the Foreign Ministry was arranging to
receive dozens of foreign dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz and Indian President R. Venkataram.
   The Faisal Masjid mosque, at the foot of the hills that overlook
the tree-lined federal capital, can hold more than 10,000 people in
its prayer hall and 200,000 on its grounds.
   The U.S. Embassy said today that a team of American
investigators would arrive at Bahawalpur, 330 miles south of
Islamabad, to help investigate the air crash that claimed the lives
of 30 people, including most of Pakistan's top military brass.
   Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the former Senate chairman,
has said he would not rule out sabotage but would await a report
from investigators.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the body of Raphel and U.S.
defense representative Brig. Gen. Herbert Wassom, who was also
killed in the crash, would be flown Saturday to the United States
for burial.
   The White House announced Thursday night the appointment of
Robert Oakley, a National Security Council adviser on South Asia,
as new U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

<HEAD>Film Blamed For Falling Test Scores At East L.A. Garfield' High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College placement scores dropped sharply for
calculus students at the school featured in ``Stand and Deliver,''
as the youths apparently learned a different lesson _ real life is
tougher than the movies.
   Fifty-five of the 119 James A. Garfield High School students who
took the rigorous mathematics exam in May received a passing score
of three or higher on a scale of one to five, according to College
Board figures, which Garfield Principal Maria Elena Tostado
provided Thursday. That represents a passing rate of 46 percent,
down from 65 percent last year, when 84 of 129 students passed.
   The students' celebrated instructor, Bolivian-born Jaime
Escalante, was visiting relatives and promoting the movie in his
native land and could not be reached for comment on the test
scores. But Ms. Tostado said he blamed the lower pass rate on the
movie.
   ``He said the kids saw the movie so many times they thought
passing the test was going to be as easy as the movie made it out
to be,'' she explained. ``He said they didn't know it was so much
hard work.''
   In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Escalante said
constant interruptions by visitors _ including Vice President
George Bush and his wife, Barbara _ were distracting and that ``the
kids are paying for it.''
   Harlan Hanson, director of the advanced placement program for
the College Board, said Garfield students still did exceptionally
well compared to students in other schools across the nation.
   The school, which serves a poor East Los Angeles community where
few parents have college educations, ranked sixth in the nation
among all schools that had passing scores on the beginning calculus
exam and 59th among schools that had passing marks on the advanced
calculus test.
   ``That's 59th out of several thousand,'' Hanson said. ``That is
by no means anything to be ashamed of. What they've got going is
great.''
   The Warner Bros. film, starring Edward James Olmos as Escalante,
told the story of the instructor's success in teaching calculus to
average students at Garfield in 1982 and their triumph over
accusations that they cheated on the advanced placement exam.
   A passing score on the exam entitles a student to college credit
at most universities.

<TEXT>
   Police said they recovered lost-long photographs
and documents from the Jack the Ripper file, but the evidence still
doesn't allow authorities to identify the man who terrorized London
a century ago.
   Nevertheless, the documents released Thursday have helped fill
in historical gaps and included a chilling letter, written in neat
script and red ink, said to be from the Ripper, according to police.
   The Ripper's five victims, all prostitutes, fell prey to the
murderer's knife in the seamy East End of London during a nine-week
period beginning Aug. 31, 1888. Most were disemboweled and
mutilated.
   ``We're quite pleased that they are in our possession now,''
Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner John Dellow said of the
photos and documents. ``We can't say at this stage where or how
they became detached or where they've been since, but they are of
some interest to us.
   ``They fill in the historical jigsaw of the Ripper murders and
one or two other things,'' Dellow told reporters at New Scotland
Yard police headquarters. But he did not think it brought anyone
closer to knowing who the Ripper was.
   The yellowed Ripper letter taunts the police for failing to
catch him.
   ``I keep hearing the police have caught me but they won't fix me
just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about
being on the right track,'' it said.
   ``Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to
squeal. How can they catch me I love my work and want to again. You
will soon hear of me with my funny little games.''
   Dellow said part of the evidence, a set of post-mortem
photographs of the Ripper's victims, was given to police last year
by the family of a deceased policeman. It was not known how they
came into his possession, he said.
   The second set of evidence appeared more mysteriously, in a
plain brown envelope mailed to police earlier this year.
   Besides the Ripper letter, whose contents have been known, the
envelope contained the announcement of a pardon for anyone with
knowledge of the Ripper; original post-mortem notes on the last
victim, Mary Kelly, and documents about an 1889 crime thought
possibly to have been the work of the Ripper.
   Dellow said, ``There's been a considerable amount of time spent
on this to try and identify where documents might have been in the
last few years,'' but it remains a mystery.
   Donald Rumbelow, who has written two books on Ripper crimes,
told The Associated Press the recovery of the evidence was
``important in the sense that ... a lot of police papers were
scattered, thrown away, destroyed ... so anything which plugs gaps
is actually doing us all a great service.''
   He said the documents would be given to the Public Records
Office, where other police files were sent in 1951.
   British Broadcasting Corp. television previewed a TV documentary
Thursday that will be shown in September titled ``Shadow of the
Ripper,'' which examines social and historical reasons why the
spate of crimes became so legendary.
   The program is one of several by British and U.S. television
producers planned to coincide with the centenary. Other
Ripper-inspired entertainment includes walking tours of London,
video games and T-shirts.

   Four sailors will be court-martialed and
four others face lesser punishment for their alleged roles in
helping an Irish teen-ager stow away aboard the destroyer Conyngham
last month, the Navy said.
   The charges involve Suzanne Twomey, 16, of Cork, Ireland, who
spent 10 days hidden aboard the warship in July.
   The Navy identified the four sailors who face court martial
Thursday.
   Seaman Apprentice David G. Peters is charged with conspiracy,
making a false official statement and bringing in and harboring an
alien. Seaman Apprentice Paul D. Davidson, Petty Officer 3rd Class
Donald L. Nichols and Seaman Anthony M. Drady are charged with
conspiracy, failure to report an offense, and bringing in and
harboring an alien.
   If convicted, the men could face up to six months in the brig,
forfeiture of two-thirds pay for six months, reduction in rate to
the lowest pay grade, and a bad-conduct discharge. The Navy said
all four courts-martial are expected to be in October.
   Citing federal Privacy Act provisions, the Navy did not identify
the other four sailors. They will face a non-judicial disciplinary
procedure in which the commanding officer of a naval unit disposes
of charges against enlisted men. If convicted, they could be
sentenced to 45 days of restriction and extra duty, reduction in
rank by one pay grade and forfeiture of half pay for two months.
   Miss Twomey was discovered July 22, one day before the ship
arrived in Norfolk, in a 2{-foot-wide, 15-foot-long, 3-foot-high
compartment above a refrigeration unit that contained electrical
wiring and pipes. She had been moved from a larger fan room where
she had spent most of her voyage, relying on crew members to bring
her food.
   She was deported back to Ireland to a facility for juveniles.

   A nurse's description of about how he
delivered a baby on an airplane, with a practical assist from the
liquor cabinet, came in handy for a colleague whose pregnant wife
suddenly went into labor.
   Hospital orderly Fred Rosario delivered his baby Tuesday using
techniques he had heard the nurse describing the day before,
including sterilizing his hands with vodka.
   ``Quite honestly, I didn't know Fred was listening that
closely,'' said his colleague, Joe Alvernaz.
   Alvernaz, a nurse at Holyoke Hospital, had told his co-workers
Monday about the delivery the previous night aboard a flight from
the Azores. He described how he sterilized his hands and scissors
with gin and vodka and assisted while a doctor delivered a baby.
   Rosario went home and told the story to his wife, Cheryl.
   ``I told him `Don't worry, I'm not going to make you go through
that,''' she recalled.
   The next morning, however, she went into labor. ``My wife said,
`Fred, the baby's right there,''' Rosario said.
   A neighbor called paramedics while Rosario sterilized his hands
with a pint of vodka and used shoelaces to tie the umbilical cord,
as Alvernaz had done.
   Then he passed out. ``I sat on the couch, closed my eyes, and
the paramedics were there,'' he said.
   He and his wife named their 5-pound, 6-ounce baby Sarah
``because it means `fast,''' he said.

   Douglas and Joan Wolff know health care
costs are skyrocketing, but they found a $15,543 bill for emergency
room treatment of Wolff's minor scrapes a little hard to swallow.
   Speaking of swallowing, Wolff was charged more than $3,000
apiece for the five Tylenol capsules he was given.
   Mrs. Wolff said Thursday that reading the computerized bill
almost sent them both back to the emergency room.
   ``At first we were shocked. We couldn't believe it,'' she said.
``Then we just had to laugh. We knew it had to be a mistake because
all he did was get cleaned up over there.''
   St. Mary-Corwin Hospital administrators acknowledged the
computer error and assured the Wolffs an amended version of the
bill would arrive soon.
   The bill was not without a touch of heart.
   The hospital offered the couple a 10 percent discount if the
bill was paid within 20 days. The discount of $1,554 would bring
the total due down to a mere $13,989.

   George Bush plunged into his campaign for
president today, proclaiming ``we're going to win this election,''
while embattled running mate Dan Quayle tried to fend off a
controversy over his military record by making light of it.
   Appearing with Bush at a GOP breakfast, Quayle said, ``I think I
know howI am to introduce myself.''
   Squaring his shoulders and standing ramrod straight, he shouted
in a clipped voice: ``I stand at attention. Name: Dan Quayle.
Serial number: 303 50 4096. Indiana National Guard, six years and
proud of it.''
   The audience responded with laughter and cheers.
   Quayle, a conservative senator from Indiana, has been dogged by
questions about whether he used family influence to get into the
National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War, virtually assuring
he would avoid combat.
   Bush, still buoyed by the rave reviews for his convention
speech, made no mention of the Quayle controversy, focusing instead
on his own self-proclaimed underdog campaign for the White House.
   ``Now we start. Now comes the beginning of the end, and last
night there was a shifting of the gears,'' Bush said, adding that
he had received a congratulatory telephone call from President
Reagan last night after accepting the GOP presidential nomination.
   Bush said he was convinced that with the party behind him, ``We
are going to win this election.''
   He and Quayle appeared at a Republican National Committee affair
before setting out for Quayle's hometown of Huntington, Ind., where
a big welcoming rally awaited them.
   Bush told the Republicans ``You have given us a tremendous
sendoff. I can't think of a better way to get out of town.'' Quayle
got a warm reception at the breakfast, receiving even more applause
than Bush.
   From Indiana, Bush will point his campaign toward big
battlefield states for the November election, visiting Ohio,
Illinois, Washington state, Oregon, California and Texas in a
non-stop blitz through Wednesday.
   ``I know that what it all comes down to, this election _ what it
all comes down to, after all the shouting and the cheers, is the
man at the desk'' in the Oval Office ``and who should sit at that
desk,'' Bush told cheering delegates in a convention windup speech
Thursday night.
   ``My friends, I am that man,'' Bush said.
   Although speechmaking is not Bush's strong suit, he delivered
his remarks with strength, confidence and poise.
   ``He hit it. He hit it out of the park,'' exulted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y. ``For me, it was (a question of) survival, the
speech of his life and he did it.'' Massachusetts delegate Joyce
Hampers called it ``a grand slam.''
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said: ``It was a sensitive speech because
he was so strong and yet so sensitive. He showed that he is attuned
to the American people. I believe he revealed a George Bush people
have not yet seen and had a chance to appreciate.''
   ``The main message here,'' said Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, ``is
America discovered George Bush.''
   Bush's wife, Barbara, delighted the convention with a tribute to
her husband. ``You've nominated for the presidency a man who is as
strong and caring and decent as America herself.''
   Yet, the controversy over Quayle cast a cloud over the
convention euphoria and the forging of a ticket to challenge
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   Republicans fretted that the furor would undermine GOP chances
of renewing their eight-year lease on the White House.
   ``It`s not going to help the ticket,'' said Illinois Secretary
of State Jim Edgar, a Republican. ``I think we'll just have to wait
a few days and see how this thing settles out.''
   ``Let's face it, the question is whether a rich kid's family got
him into the Guard when other people were getting drafted,'' said
John DeCamp, a Vietnam veteran and GOP delegate from Nebraska.
``Some of them like me got shot at a lot and great many of them
just got shot and killed.''
   Quayle, a member of an influential newspaper family, refused to
discuss the matter Thursday on the grounds it would detract from
Bush's acceptance speech. ``It's the vice president's night, why
should Sen. Quayle hold some big news conference?'' said press
secretary Sheila Tate.
   The Democratic opposition campaign stepped around the
controversy over Quayle and the National Guard but raised questions
about his qualifications. ``We leave it to the American people to
judge who made the best decision, who made the presidential
decision,'' said Paul Brountas, chairman of Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign. ``The key question is: Did (Bush) pick the
person who is best qualified to serve?''
   Quayle had an abundance of defenders, most notably George Bush.
   ``I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side,'' Bush said, giving
delegates an unmistakable sign that he was not backing away from
his running mate. The declaration triggered roars of approval.
   Bush, recently revived in the polls after a 17-point deficit to
Dukakis, said: ``There are a lot of great stories in politics about
the underdog winning _ and this is going to be one of them. I mean
to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the issues _ and I mean to
win.''
   Striking back at the theme of Dukakis' speech in the Democratic
convention last month, Bush said, ``Some say this isn't an election
about ideology, it's an election about competence.
   ``But this election isn't only about competence, for competence
is a narrow idea,'' Bush said. ``Competence makes the trains run on
time but doesn't know where they're going.''
   Quayle, accepting the vice presidential nomination, referred
only indirectly to the flap surrounding him. He mentioned his
service in the National Guard and said, ``I am proud of it.''
   ``I am privileged to be the first person of my generation to be
on a national ticket,'' said the 41-year-old baby-boomer. ``I don't
presume to talk for everyone of my generation, but I know that a
great many will agree with me when I express thanks to George
Bush's generation for bringing us an era of peace and freedom and
opportunity.''

   Maung Maung, an American-educated
intellectual and Burma's first civilian leader in 26 years, is seen
as a figurehead for military powerbrokers but a leader who could
calm violent anti-government protests.
   Maung Maung, recently named the country's attorney-general,
today was elected chairman of the ruling political party, Burma's
most powerful post, and the country's president.
   Although Maung Maung has been closely associated with the
military dominated political system that activists seek to
dismantle, some analysts say his civilian status and only indirect
involvement in the recent ruthless suppression of dissent may serve
to blunt the protest movement.
   The 63-year-old Maung Maung has been a journalist, lawyer and
author who joined senior government and party ranks following the
1962 coup by Ne Win.
   He is described by Tzang Yawnghwe, an author and son of Burma's
first president, as ``one of the few Burmese intellectuals who
sincerely and deeply admired Gen. Ne Win.''
   Maung Maung served as Ne Win's personal legal adviser, wrote a
flattering book _ ``Burma and General Ne Win''_ about the
authoritarian leader, and was one of the architects of the
country's 1974 constitution.
   He was born Jan. 11, 1925 and graduated from high school in
Mandalay, the former royal capital. He enrolled at Mandalay
University's law school but his higher education was interrupted by
the outbreak of World War II and the fight for Burmese independence
from Great Britain.
   Maung Maung joined the Burma Independence Army, a ragtag but
fiery outfit organized by the leaders of the independence struggle
known as the ``Thirty Comrades.'' The army, which included Ne Win
in a key leadership role, marched into Burma from Thailand in early
1942 initially bent on fighting with the Japanese against the
British but later switching to the Allied side.
   Rising from a private to second lieutentant, Maung Maung wrote
romantically of his army days in a 1974 autobiographical work
called ``To a Soldier Son.''
   ``The army has remained my second home in all my wanderings over
the years,'' Maung Maung wrote in a passage reflecting his intimate
relationship with Burma's military rulers.
   After Burma gained independence in 1948, Maung Maung studied at
Rangoon University. Describing himself as ``an eternal student,''
Maung Maung later received a doctorate in international law from
Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a law degree from Yale
University, where he spent two years as a visiting lecturer in the
early 1960s.
   Following the 1962 coup, he served as chief justice and in 1971
became a member of the ruling Revolutionary Council. He was also
elected to the central committee of the Burma Socialist Program
Party.
   After the promulgation of the 1974 constitution, which he helped
write, and the replacement of the council by a formal government
apparatus, Maung Maung became a member of the powerful Council of
State.
   The constitution formalized Ne Win's ``Burmese Way to
Socialism,'' an amalgam of socialism, Buddhist philosophy and
centralized, one-party rule. In its international relations, Burma
took a strictly non-aligned stance.
   Maung Maung was elected to the party's central executive
committee at the Third Party Congress in 1976 and was ranked fifth
in the party hierarchy. He resigned from this committee at the
fifth congress in 1985.
   Following the resignation of Ne Win as chairman July 23, his
replacement by Sein Lwin, and the subsequent shake-ups in both
party and government ranks, Maung Maung returned to the central
executive committee.
   He was also named attorney-general, making him only one of two
civilians among retired or active military officers in the top
echelons of government. The other is Education Minister Kyaw Sein.
   Hugh C. MacDougall, a Burma scholar and former U.S. diplomat in
Rangoon, said Thursday that Maung Maung had a higher profile abroad
than inside Burma. Most Burmese, MacDougall said, realized a man
like Maung Maung was of limited consequence yet from the outside he
was seen as a ``unique species''_ a rare civilian among military
powerbrokers.
   ``I don't see him as anyone likely to take over the real
leadership,'' MacDougall said in an interview.
   American Burma scholar Josef Silverstein and several other Burma
experts contacted said they expect a transitional government that
would try to calm political turbulence and institute some economic
reforms.
   Silverstein said that whoever emerged as formal leader would
probably be controlled by military figures.
   But even as a mouthpiece, Maung Maung's ability to deal with the
current crisis and his appeal among student activists would be
important.
   ``Youth is the time of ideals, of anger, of energy,'' he wrote
in the 1974 book. ``How to turn those ideals, anger and energy to
happy and creative purposes is the challenge that society must meet
all the time.''

   More than 2{ years after a flawed
booster rocket joint doomed the Challenger, the redesigned part is
``the safest thing on the space shuttle'' and elated engineers say
the craft is ready to launch.
   Meanwhile, technicians at Cape Canaveral, Fla., bolted a clamp
over a gas leak on the Discovery and applied a sealing compound
today as they worked to clear one of the last remaining hurdles to
liftoff.
   NASA spokeswoman Pat Phillips said the compound would have to
set for several hours, then workers would run pressure checks over
the weekend to determine how well the seal worked.
   NASA and Morton Thiokol hailed Thursday's performance of a
deliberately flawed booster in the last in a series of five
test-firings required before Discovery can proceed with its
scheduled flight this fall.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for the company, which
designs the booster rockets.
   ``We're ready to go launch,'' said Allan McDonald, Morton
Thiokol's vice president of engineering, after inspecting the
126-foot-long booster following the two-minute horizontal test.
   The test culminated a $470 million effort to correct a faulty
joint seal that on Jan. 28, 1986, allowed a plume of fiery gas to
escape, triggering the explosion that killed Challenger's seven
crew members.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years. We did what we said we were going
to do, and yet it seems like yesterday that it happened,'' said
McDonald, who had argued before the Challenger launch that cold
temperatures would imperil the craft.
   Investigators later found that freezing temperatures the night
before contributed to the failure of one of the three joints used
to hold the rocket's cylindrical cases together.
   ``I think the (redesign program) went far beyond what anybody
anticipated it would do, as a result of that failure 2{ years
ago,'' McDonald said. ``We built in a joint that is clearly, in my
mind, the safest thing on the space shuttle vehicle.''
   For Thursday's booster test, two of the three joints, the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint, were riddled
with 14 intentional flaws intended to test them to their limits as
the rocket burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant. The third joint
was left unflawed as a comparison.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut
with a razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach the
joint's middle O-ring, one of three designed to contain heat from
the burning fuel.
   The flaws were introduced to prove the new joints would contain
the gas despite defects far more severe than any that could escape
Morton Thiokol's inspection process, said company spokesman Rocky
Raab.
   After the test, which sent clouds of dust and smoke billowing
thousands of feet in the air and shook the ground at an observation
station 9,000 feet away, some 300 NASA and company observers
cheered.
   Engineers deemed the $20 million test a success after a
preliminary inspection. If the evaluation holds, and NASA workers
can plug the fuel leak in Discovery, NASA officials will be able to
set a firm launch date in late September or early October, said
Royce Mitchell, solid rocket motor program manager at the Marshall
Space Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``It looks like just an absolutely great test from top to
bottom,'' he said. ``The end of September is still within our
sights.''
   Progress appeared to be made today in fixing the hard-to-reach
fuel leak.
   With the Discovery upright on its launch pad, technicians
squeezed into the ship's cramped cargo bay to attach a
clamshell-like clamp on a half-inch diameter line that was detected
leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas more than a month ago.
   Once the 2-inch device was in place, the workers began filling
it, under pressure, with a sealing compound.
   Morton Thiokol and NASA engineers planned to begin disassembling
the motor Monday and expected final test results within two weeks,
Raab said.
   McDonald said preliminary indications were that every safety
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no
immediate evidence of problems in any of four flawed joints.
   ``The data says we got pressure where we wanted to get it and we
didn't get any pressure where we didn't want to get it. And that's
extremely good news,'' said Mitchell.
   With the motor testing and redesign, which included scores of
improvements to other components, Morton Thiokol has run five or
six times the number of tests that were done prior to the first
shuttle launch, and in half the time, he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Begins Whistle-stop Tour, Criticizes Bush on Deficit</HEAD>

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, embarking on a whistle-stop tour through three
states, declared today that the ``mission'' promised by George Bush
``missed a page,'' ignoring the federal budget and trade deficit
threatening the nation's economy.
   ``Last night we heard a lot of talk about missions,'' Dukakis
said, referring to Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican
National Convention.
   ``He talked a lot about missions, but I must have missed a
page,'' the Democratic nominee told a trackside rally in this
southern Illinois town outside St. Louis. ``We didn't hear a word
from the Republicans about the budget deficit or the trade deficit
last night, or this week, and we know why. They don't know how to
deal with them.''
   Dukakis recalled Harry Truman's love of whistle-stop campaigning
and looked on as his campaign train rolled into the Belleville
station at the end of the morning rally.
   After the whistle-stop tour, through parts of Illinois, Missouri
and Arkansas, Dukakis was flying late in the day to Texas and a
meeting with running mate Lloyd Bentsen. Dukakis planned to
campaign in Tennessee on Saturday.
   The train trip comes a day after Dukakis visited the South to
reaffirm his commitment to Civil Rights.
   ``After eight long years, this nation needs a president who
understands that civil rights can never be a sometime thing,''
Dukakis told black voters at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church in
Birmingham, Ala.
   He all but conceded the black vote to Jesse Jackson during the
primary season and held few campaign events designed for black
audiences.
   He also came in for criticism after he spoke at a Philadelphia,
Miss., rally Aug. 4, on the anniversary of the slaying of three
civil rights workers there in 1964, but made no mention of the
episode.
   At the Birmingham rally, he accused the Reagan administration of
ignoring the concerns of black Americans. He called for improved
job training, prenatal care, drug education and housing
opportunities for minorities.
   He also paid tribute to four young girls killed in a 1963
bombing at a nearby church.
   ``We can turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took
place or ... we can provide the moral leadership we need to banish
racial and religious violence forever from this country,'' Dukakis
said. ``And that leadership must begin in the White House. It must
begin at the top.''
   Dukakis called civil rights activists ``true American heroes''
and promised to participate later this month in a march to mark the
25th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on Washington.
   ``It will be a day for America to march together, as one
community, rich and poor, young and old, black brown and white, a
community of citizens that cares for each other and _ yes _ loves
each other,'' Dukakis said. Former rival Jesse Jackson is scheduled
to appear at the march with Dukakis.
   Dukakis was introduced to the congregation by Birmingham Mayor
Richard Arrington, a Jackson supporter in the primaries.
   ``In Mike Dukakis we have a man that we can all be very proud
of,'' said Arrington. ``All we have to do is roll up our sleeves
and go to work. Alabama is going to be in the Democratic column.''

<HEAD>Thousands Reported Killed In Ethnic Violence In Burundi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people were killed in the
central African nation of Burundi in ethnic clashes this week
before the army restored order, diplomats and opposition leaders
said.
   The government imposed emergency rules to prevent further
clashes.
   The fighting was between the Hutu, Burundi's majority tribe, and
the Tutsi, the minority tribe that controls the military and rules
the country.
   After an abortive coup attempt in 1972 in the former Belgian
colony, the Tutsi massacred 100,000 Hutu.
   More than 7,000 Burudians fled into neighboring Rwanda to escape
the killing this week, said Western diplomats in Rwanda. The
diplomats quoted refugees from both tribes as saying thousands were
killed.
   The government-owned radio, monitored in Nairobi, said today
that the most recent trouble began Sunday in the northern villages
of Marangara and Ntega.
   ``Some inhabitants of northern Burundi belonging to the minority
Tutsi tribe were killed in a selective manner,'' the radio said
without elaboration. It said an overnight curfew was imposed
throughout the country.
   The emergency order also prohibits throughout the country
meetings of more than five people without government permission, it
said. The order was signed by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi who took
power in a bloodless coup in September.
   Astere Nzisabira, Burundi's ambassador to Belgium, said in a
radio and television interview Thursday in Brussels:
   ``We suspect that some former Hutu refugees infiltrated the
country from some foreign countries. They incited the Hutu
population and called on them to massacre the Tutsi population.''
   In an attack on one area in northern Burundia on Sunday, ``they
massacred all the Tutsis,'' he said. He did not provide figures or
name the area.
   ``The authorities then intervened in a peaceful manner,''
Nzisabira said. ``But the following day, the murders resumed in
full swing. At that stage, the army had to intervene and restore
peace to the country.'' When asked if there were 400 victims, he
said the estimate was much too low.
   The Hutu People Liberation Party, a movement of exiled
government opponents, accused the military of massacring Hutus.
   ``There are thousands of Hutus corpses, the victims of Tutsi
soldiers, floating in Lake Tanganyika,'' the opposition group said.
There was no way to confirm the claim independently.
   Burundi, with nearly 5 million people crammed into an area about
the size of Maryland, is one of Africa's most densely populated
countries. About 85 percent of its people belong to the Hutu tribe,
while the rest are Tutsis.
   Since independence from Belgium in 1962, Burundi has been
wracked by protracted factional and ethnic struggles.
   For generations, the tall, lanky Tutsi held the short, stocky
Hutu in feudal serfdom. This led to one of the worst ethnic
slaughters in independent Africa.
   In April 1972, the Hutu tried to overthrow the government. The
coup was suppressed and the Tutsi retailiated by systematically
killing 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia.
   In 1976, Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza staged a bloodless coup
ousting Michel Micombero, who had sanctioned the Hutu slaughter.
   Bagaza, like Micombero, was a Tutsi. Bagaza was overthrown Sept.
4, 1987, by Buyoya, who came to power vowing to end ethnic
differences.

<HEAD>Con Man Arrested As Result Of TV Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tip from a viewer of a television
show that profiles wanted criminals has led to the arrest of a man
who allegedly posed as a policeman and helped con $12,200 from an
elderly woman, police said.
   Leroy Carter, 56, of Chicago, also was wanted in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey in similar scams, according to Sgt. Vincent Paterno.
   Carter allegedly was one of a group of con artists who told a
White Plains woman, whose name was not released, that they were
police officers. In the con, which took place sometime in early
April, they persuaded the woman to entrust her money to them.
   Carter had been profiled on Fox Broadcasting's ``America's Most
Wanted'' program on April 3. That segment was to be repeated this
Saturday, and a promotional spot for the rerun was seen by a viewer
in the New York City area, who called the program's toll-free
number Wednesday and said he had seen Carter in the Harlem section
of Manhattan, said Jack Breslin, a publicist for Fox Broadcasting
in Los Angeles.
   Acting on the tip, police from this New York City suburb tracked
down Carter and arrested him Thursday in Harlem.
   He was charged with third-degree grand larceny and first-degree
crimimal impersonation and was being held pending arraignment.
   The April 3 program detailed a scam against a Chicago woman who
lost her life's savings to a con man identified as Carter.
   The White Plains con took place soon after the broadcast. Police
were tipped then by someone who saw the show and recognized Carter,
and the White Plains victim identified Carter as the perpetrator.
   Breslin said 82 subjects have been profiled on ``America's Most
Wanted'' since the program began Feb. 7, and viewer tips have led
to the arrests of 19 people.

   George Bush's acceptance speech for the
Republican presidential nomination was rated a ``home run'' today
by Republican National Committee Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf as the
new GOP ticket was given a warm sendoff by Republican leaders.
   Bush, in turn, told a post-convention meeting of the Republican
National Committee he appreciated the many plaudits he has received
for the speech, including one that came by phone Thursday night
from President Reagan.
   ``I just can't think of a better way to get out of town,'' the
vice president joked as he and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, embarked on the ticket's maiden campaign trip.
   Their first stop was to be Quayle's hometown of Huntington,
Ind., for a rally. The two will campaign in the Midwest together
through Sunday, when Bush will go on alone for another three days
of campaigning on the West Coast.
   The vice president gave what many Republicans said was the best
speech of his career Thursday night. He portrayed himself as ``not
the most eloquent'' and confessed ``I may be sometimes a little
awkward.''
   ``I am a quiet man _ but I hear the quiet people others don't,''
Bush told the final session of the Republican National Convention
in a speech that probed a personality he previously had claimed was
not in focus for the public.
   ``You hit a home run, Mr. Vice President, you hit a home run,''
Fahrenkopf told Bush.
   At today's meeting, Bush gained effective control over the
national party for the fall campaign as the committee voted without
dissent to install Fred Malek, who had been Bush's convention
manager, as deputy chairman.
   Fahrenkopf, at Bush's request, will stay on as chairman, but
with reduced responsibilities, as Malek assumes command of
election-related activities of the party.
   Bush told the panel that he received a call from Reagan after
his speech.``I told him I would do my level best to move forward
along the lines we talked about last night. ... We're going to win
this election.''
   ``Now we start, now comes the beginning of the end,'' Bush said.
``Last night, there was a shifting of the gears.'
   But, added Bush, ``I'm not going to give you the whole load
after a long night.''
   In his speech, Bush talked about his family, his values, and
what he called his desire for a ``kinder, gentler nation,'' drawing
repeated applause from his convention audience.
   Just as Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis had done
at his party's convention last month, the vice president delivered
a speech that was better received than even some supporters had
expected.
   ``A grand slam,'' said Massachusetts delegate Joyce Hampers.
   ``I think he touched all the important bases he needed to
touch,'' said Oklahoma delegate Dick Freeman.
   And, even though Bush's day of triumph was clouded by questions
surrounding Quayle's military service, Bush declared: ``I'm proud
to have Dan Quayle at my side.''
   In his acceptance speech, which Bush had carefully fine-tuned
and practiced over the past two weeks with speechwriter Peggy
Noonan, the vice president sought to portray himself as an underdog
in his race against Dukakis.
   ``There are a lot of great stories in politics about the
underdog winning _ and this is going to be one of them,'' Bush said.
   ``I mean to run hard, to fight hard, to stand on the issues _
and I mean to win.''
   Bush's speech was calculated to help him emerge from the shadow
of President Reagan _ a man to whom Bush said he had given absolute
loyalty over the past seven years _ and to paint a portrait of
himself as a man of sensitivity.
   ``Those of you who saw the president's speech this week, and
listened to the simple truth of his words, will understand my
loyalty all these years. But now you must see me for what I am: the
Republican candidate for the president of the United States,'' he
said.
   Bush aides, who beforehand had sought to lower expectations
about the speech, said they were delighted with the way it had been
received.
   ``There was not a single thing he was intending to set out to
accomplish that wasn't accomplished,'' said Rich Bond, the
political director of his campaign. Campaign Manager Lee Atwater
exclaimed: ``The delegates on the floor were going wild. He really
outdid himself. I've never seen him do better.''
   Bush brought laughter from his audience when he joked that his
wife, Barbara, had found him tired recently while working on his
speech and had implored him to relax and ``put up your silver
foot.''
   It was a self-mocking reference to Democratic keynoter Ann
Richards' taunt that Bush, with his privileged family background
and his tendency to make verbal gaffes, was ``born with a silver
foot in his mouth.''
   Republicans indicated that they found little evidence of a foot
in his mouth, silver or otherwise, in his Thursday night
performance.
   ``It was great,'' said Tennessee delegate Shirley Duer. ``It was
his finest hour. He just couldn't hold back his charisma.''
   Bush, who like Dukakis is often characterized as lacking a
strong personality, had joked at the start of his acceptance
speech, ``To be fair to the other side, I'll try to hold back my
charisma.''

<HEAD>U.N. Observers Take Border Positions; Iran Says Iraq May Not Want
Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. military observers took up positions
today along the Iran-Iraq border on the eve of a scheduled
cease-fire, and Iran's military leader warned that Iraq may not
really want peace.
   ``We are facing two paths, war and peace. We chose peace but we
are not sure about Iraq,'' said Hashemi Rafsanjani, acting
commander in chief of Iran's army as well as Parliament speaker.
   Rafsanjani spoke at a weekly prayer sermon at Tehran University.
His remarks were carried by official Tehran radio, monitored in
Nicosia.
   The Iranian leader warned that ``if the enemy wants to continue
the war, it will continue much more seriously.''
   U.N. observers, meanwhile, were deployed along the 730-mile
border between the two countries, ready to start monitoring when a
cease-fire goes into effect just after dawn Saturday in the
8-year-old war.
   ``Ninety-five percent of them are on the ground, and we're
receiving excellent cooperation from both sides,'' said a source in
the U.N. secretariat's office in New York. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In Baghdad, U.N. officials said more than 100 observers were
deployed ``steadily and smoothly'' along the Iraqi border.
   Brig. Gen. V.M. Patil of India is to head the group of 150 U.N.
observers in Iraq while an Irish officer will head the group in
Iran. A Yugoslav officer, Gen. Slavko Jovic, will command the
entire operation, traveling between the two countries.
   The gulf peacekeeping force totals about 1,300 military and
civilian personnel, of whom 350 are unarmed military observers from
24 countries. The United Nations has budgeted $74 million for the
mission.
   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq are to meet
in Geneva for U.N.-sponsored talks mediated by Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The official Iraqi News Agency announced today that Basra
International Airport will be inaugurated Saturday. The report was
monitored in Nicosia.
   Basra, Iraq's second largest city and its major port,
experienced some of the heaviest fighting in the Persian Gulf war.
The city suffered extensive damage and its airport has been closed
since the beginning of the fighting.
   The city is just 20 miles from the border, in an air corridor so
sensitive that Jovic, head of the U.N. observers, flew from Baghdad
to Tehran via Turkey.

   Lebanese newspapers today blamed
differences between the United States and Syria for preventing
Parliament from electing a pro-Syrian president.
   Also today, Syrian troops defused a car bomb near the Central
Bank office in Moslem west Beirut 10 minutes before the device was
set to explode, police reported. A police spokesman said the car
was packed with 33 pounds of explosives and parked in a gas station.
   The car bomb was the second found in the past two days in
Beirut. On Thursday, the Syrians defused another car rigged with
110 pounds of explosives in south Beirut's neighborhood of
Maamoura, the spokesman said.
   Beirut's independent daily An-Nahar said Parliament failed to
muster the quorum for the expected election of Suleiman Franjieh on
Thursday due to the ``United States' stand opposing the election of
a confrontational candidate.''
   The leftist As-Safir newspaper said the first round of
presidential elections ``fell by the American knockout strike.''
   An-Nahar, in an editorial, blamed differences between U.S. and
Syrian officials, calling the outcome in Washington's favor, ``not
because it opposes Syria's role in Lebanon, but because it objects
to the character of challenge that overwhelmed the elections
process.''
   The United States expressed regret Thursday at the failure to
elect a president and attributed it to the lack of a ``consensus
candidate.''
   Hard-line Christians opposed to Syria's role in Lebanon headed
off the expected election of Franjieh, a 78-year-old Maronite
Catholic, by preventing the required quorum for the vote. Only 38
representatives showed up for the session. Quorum for electing a
new president was set at 51 members.
   A ranking police officer said the Christian Lebanese Forces
militia on Thursday held some deputies and told others living in
Christian areas of the country they could not attend the meeting.
He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Lebanese Forces, headed by Samir Geagea, opposes Franjieh,
who was Lebanon's president from 1970 to 1976. Franjieh blames
Geagea for leading a 1978 raid that killed his eldest son,
daughter-in-law and 3-year-old granddaughter.
   Franjieh, Syria's closest Christian ally in Lebanon, repeatedly
has vowed revenge. Syria is the main powerbroker in Lebanon with
40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and
south Beirut.
   ``The election of Franjieh as president is the death sentence to
the Lebanese Forces,'' said a Paliament member, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In Jerusalem, Israel radio reported Lebanese Christian and
non-Christian leaders appealed to Israel to intervene in the
elections, but Israel said it would not. The report quoted Uri
Lubrani, the Defense Ministry coordinator of Israeli policy in
Lebanon. It did not specify what type of intervention was requested
or specify who made the appeal.
   According to Lebanon's Constitution, a president should be
elected in two months before President Amin Gemayel's six-year term
ends Sept. 23.
   No new election date has been set.

   A bank robber fired the bullet that
killed an 18-year-old woman hostage, one of three people who died
in a 54-hour crime spree across West Germany and the Netherlands,
officials said today.
   West German media said if police had moved sooner, they may have
prevented the deaths. Two bank robbers and a woman accomplice, who
hijacked a bus at one point with 30 people aboard, left a trail of
terror across Germany and the Netherlands before police captured
them Thursday in a shootout near Bonn.
   Hostage Silke Bischof, 18, squeezed next to one of the gunmen
with a pistol pointed at her head, had spoken to reporters Thursday
while the getaway car was parked in downtown Cologne. She said she
was being treated well but that she feared someone would be killed
if police moved in to end the hostage crisis.
   Two hours later, she was killed in the gun battle with police,
who set off flash bombs to stop the getaway car on a busy highway.
The other hostage in the car, also a woman, was injured.
   One of the gunmen, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, was shot in the
thigh, said Reinhard Schmidt-Kuentzel, a spokesman for the North
Rhine-Westphalia Interior Ministry. The other gunman, Dieter
Degowski, 32, and Marion Irma Loeblich, the accomplice, were not
injured, he said. All three were under arrest.
   ``We are 99 percent certain that Degowski fired the shot that
killed Silke Bischof,'' he said. ``We know one of the two gunmen
killed her.''
   Earlier, a 15-year-old Italian boy held hostage and a police
officer died in the bizarre drama. Reports said the boy died trying
to protect his sister.
   ``Did they have to die? Shouldn't the police have moved in much
earlier?'' the mass-circulation Bild newspaper asked in a
front-page editorial.
   Police gave the bank robbers two getaway cars and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in efforts to persuade them to free their
hostages and surrender. The shooting sprees and car chases left at
least five people injured.
   ``Police should have acted much more decisively and swiftly,''
said Heinz Guenther, a lawmaker with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Party.
   A random telephone poll by the respected Wickert Institute in
Tuebingen said 93 percent of the respondents could not understand
why police did not act sooner to end the situation.
   Eighty-nine percent of the 1,708 people questioned said they
believed the top state-level politicians responsible for law and
order should resign because of the incident. No percentage of error
was given.
   But law officials such as Peter Mueller, police chief in the
northern port of Bremen, defended their actions.
   Mueller rejected suggestions that sharpshooters should have been
used to kill the bandits while the drama was being played out in
his city.
   ``There was not one moment when sharpshooters could have been
used, because the bandits never let themselves be exposed without
others around them,'' Mueller said.
   But the leftist-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau daily newspaper
noted no policemen were in sight when the gunmen hijacked the bus.
``Rarely have TV pictures shown a more helpless government than
they did on this night in Bremen,'' the newspaper said in an
editorial.
   Journalists were criticized for conducting on-the-scene
interviews with the bandits, giving the gunmen a nationwide public
forum. Reporters crowded around one of the armed bandits as he gave
interviews in Bremen and Cologne.
   ``The bandits were able to find out through information obtained
from journalists that they were being followed,'' said Herbert
Schnoor, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state. Schnoor
did not elaborate.
   He also blamed the news media for the bandits' refusals to take
up direct contact with police while using journalists to relay
their demands instead.
   The German Journalists Association urged reporters to never
``allow yourselves to become tools of criminals.''
   The crime spree began with a bank robbery Tuesday in Gladbeck,
50 miles north of Cologne. The gunmen escaped with two bank
employees and $227,000 in a car provided by authorities. Police
provided the bulk of the money _ $162,000 _ to try to ensure the
hostages' safety.
   In Bremen, 135 miles northwest of Gladbeck, the bandits,
accompanied by the accomplice, commandeered a bus with about 30
hostages on Wednesday. Police seized Ms. Loeblich, the accomplice,
at a rest stop.
   The Frankfurt-based Abendpost newspaper today quoted police as
saying a gunman then pulled 9-year-old Tatlana de Giorgi off the
bus and threatened to kill her. It said her brother, 15-year-old
Emanuele de Giorgi, rushed to protect her and was shot to death.
Police then let the woman go, and she got on the bus, which drove
across the border into the Netherlands.
   Authorities said an officer died in a crash pursuing the gunmen.
   Most of the hostages were set free near the Dutch border town of
Oldenzaal, authorities said. The gunmen, their companion and two
women hostages got into a high-powered BMW sedan provided by police
and raced back into West Germany, where they were ambushed.

   A strong earthquake jolted the
Indonesian island of Celebes, damaging buildings and slightly
injuring eight people, a newspaper said today.
   Indonesian sources issued conflicting reports on the strength of
the earthquake, which hit the Celebes capital, Manado, at 6:09 a.m.
Thursday.
   The Suara Pembaruan newspaper today said it registered a
magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale, but the Meteorological
Agency earlier reported the quake at a magnitude of 4.8. The
earthquake's epicenter was 15 miles northwest of Manado, the paper
said.
   The newspaper said the tremors damaged a tax office, court
building and development agency office in Manado. It quoted
hospital sources as saying eight people were slightly injured, but
all later were released from the hospital.
   At least 10 minor quakes followed the earthquake, causing cracks
in other buildings, the paper said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Three wax figures at the Forney Transportation
Museum have lost their heads, and the heist is creating headaches
for the museum staff.
   Sometime during the past few weeks, the wax heads of Benjamin
Franklin, western author William M. ``Bill'' Raine and an unnamed
man who was dinner for cannibal Alferd Packer were stolen from a
storeroom.
   The heads, plus a Stetson cowboy hat atop Raine's head, are
worth an estimated $1,300. There have been no ransom notes.
   Police detectives investigating the case report they have made
no headway.
   Building manager Steve Meyer said few people knew that the
museum, a private facility featuring antique cars and other
exhibits, owned the 35 to 40 wax figures. They were bought about 10
years ago when a wax museum closed its doors, but officials never
got around to using them and they've been stuck in the little-used
storeroom.
   Meyer realized the heads were missing Wednesday when he went to
the storeroom searching for a light. ``I noticed Ben Franklin
standing there with no head,'' he said.
   But Meyer is puzzled over the thief's choice of loot. ``They
took one big name, Ben Franklin,'' and the skull from the Packer
tableau might appeal to any prankster, he said. ``But I don't know
why they'd want (Raine). I never heard of him.''
   For the record, Raine died in 1954 at age 83 and was the author
of 82 books. Most of his novels, read one review, fell under the
genre of ``rootin', tootin' Westerns.'' Raine was also a one-time
editorial writer for the Rocky Mountain News.
   Packer is Colorado's only convicted cannibal. A mountaineering
guide, he was imprisoned for killing and eating five companions
during the winter of 1873-74.

   The sister of American hostage Terry
Anderson protested new demands outlined by the captors of her
brother and called them unreasonable in a statement published today.
   Also today, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa said the release of the
British hostages was imminent but said the release of other
hostages would take more time. The report, quoting an unidentified
west Beirut leader, said two separate negotiations to free the
hostages are under way.
   The report in Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of U.S. secret
arms sale to Iran in November 1986, could not be independently
verified. Many of its previous stories about the hostages have not
been accurate.
   It said the kidnappers sought money and ``and at the same time
economic, military and political conditions set by Iran.'' It did
not elaborate.
   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, said, ``I think it is grossly
unjust for you to hold Terry Anderson for ransom that includes what
amounts to a complete peace settlement in the entire region and the
end of centuries' old hostilities.'' The text of Mrs. Say's message
was published by Beirut's two leading newspapers, An-Nahar and
As-Safir.
   ``In the past three and a half years, I have tried my very best
to pressure my government to negotiate for Terry's release and the
release of the other hostages,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``You have now presented new demands which are impossible for me
to put forth to my government,'' wrote Mrs. Say, who lives in
Kentucky.
   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press and has been held longer than any of the 18
foreign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which holds
Anderson and American hostage Thomas Sutherland, released a
statement Thursday that set four demands for the release of the
captives.
   Two of the demands were new: the unconditional withdrawal of all
the Israeli forces and their Christian militia allies from south
Lebanon, and U.S. compensation and aid for the reconstruction of
war-ravaged south Lebanon and Beirut.
   The group also demanded the release of all Lebanese and
Palestinian ``mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, from prisons in
Christian east Beirut as well as in Israel and Israel's
self-designated security zone in Lebanon. Israel and allied
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army control a 10-mile-deep enclave
in south Lebanon to guard against cross-border guerrilla forays.
   Unlike many of its previous communications, the Shiite Moslem
faction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspects
held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.
But the sweeping statement about prisoners seemed to incorporate
this demand.
   Islamic Jihad has admitted holding Anderson and Sutherland, 56,
acting dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
Sutherland, of Fort Collins, Colo., was abducted June 9, 1985.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican church envoy Terry
Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast
man with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also
sought by the Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.

   The IRA said it set two bombs
that damaged Northern Ireland's newest luxury hotel and injured
three police officers at a gas station today.
   The bombs exploded hours before the funeral of Regimental Sgt.
Maj. Michael Heakin, 38, who was killed by IRA gunmen in the
Belgian port of Ostend a week ago as his car stopped for a traffic
light.
   More than 1,000 mourners at the parish church of St. Edward in
the Welsh town of Knighton heard his cousin, the Rev. Leo Heakin,
pray that ``the forces of evil and terrorism will never ever have
the last word in our world and that peace and justice will
prevail.''
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end
British rule in the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with
the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic, claimed responsibility
for the bombings in a coded message to a Belfast radio station.
   Staff and guests were evacuated from the Mourne Country Hotel in
Newry after three warning calls to a Newry hospital and the
Samaritans just before 2:30 a.m., police said.
   Minutes later, a car bomb exploded outside, causing extensive
damage to the hotel's kitchen area, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force.
   Police said it was not known how many people had been in the
hotel, which is near the border with the Irish Republic. They said
there were no injuries.
   At 1 a.m., police said a bomb exploded as three police officers
were investigating a ringing burglar alarm at a gas station in
Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. A policewoman lost an eye and two
policemen suffered minor cuts to the face, the spokesman said.
   On Thursday, two masked gunmen shot and killed a Roman Catholic
workman renovating a house in Belfast, and British army experts
defused a parcel bomb sent to a leading Protestant politician.
   Police said gunmen walked into the house on Cliftonville Road,
and shot Michael Laverty, 32, in the head and chest.
   The parcel bomb, sent to Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for
the largest Protestant party in the province, the Official
Unionists, was the second this month to be sent to a member of
Parliament representing Northern Ireland.
   Maginnis said he called the bomb disposal squad after he became
suspicious about the package that arrived at his home in Dungannon,
County Tyrone, 40 miles west of Belfast.

   An apartment building collapsed today in a
crowded neighborhood, killing 16 tenants and injuring nine. Rescue
teams searched the rubble for more bodies, police said.
   The five-story building housed 60 people in Shubra, a low-income
area on the city's northern outskirts. It crumbled early today, the
Moslem Sabbath, while most of its inhabitants were starting their
day, said a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Three adjacent buildings, whose walls suffered damage by the
collapse, and four more neighboring houses were declared dangerous
and their tenants evacuated, the officer said.
   The area was cordoned off and rescue teams were searching the
rubble for survivors or trapped bodies. The number of missing and
rescued people was not known, the officer said.
   ``I heard a sound of explosion,'' said Zeinab Ibrahim, a tenant
who lost two of her eight children.
   ``The sound grew louder, and we ran downstairs, most of us were
outside except for the two children when the house fell,'' she said.
   Unlike many houses in Egypt that collapse because of age, the
building in Shubra was only 5 years old but had been poorly built.
   Its tenants recently agreed to help put up missing support
beams, and some of them evacuated their homes a few days ago when
they heard the warning sounds of cracking walls, witnesses said.

   A woman was convicted of voluntary
manslaughter for shooting to death her second husband, 20 years
after she admitted shooting to death her first husband.
   A jury deliberated two hours Wednesday before convicting Hazel
Allison, 47, in the Jan. 11 shotgun death of Eddie Boyd Allison,
47, her husband of 17 years.
   Mrs. Allison, of Clover, had testified that she had been abused
by Allison and shot him in self-defense.
   Judge Hubert Long sentenced the woman to 30 years in prison, the
maximum sentence. She must serve at least 10 years before becoming
eligible for parole.
   Jurors, who could have found Mrs. Allison guilty of murder,
seemed stunned to learn after issuing their verdict that Mrs.
Allison had killed her first husband, Billy Byers Johnson, in 1968.
   ``We all had a feeling that something was being held back, but
we didn't know what it was,'' The Herald of Rock Hill quoted an
unidentified juror as saying.
   Long explained that Mrs. Allison's history was withheld during
the trial because of state trial rules limiting the use of prior
criminal records.
   Deputy Solicitor Larry Grant said Mrs. Allison pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in the 1968 case. She was sentenced to a two-year
suspended prison term and placed on probation for three years.
   She claimed self-defense that time also, Grant said. In both
cases, she said she and her husband had begun arguing after the man
returned home from hunting, and that she then shot him.
   In offering mitigating circumstances to justify a lower
sentence, Assistant Public Defender Roberta Wright commented, ``She
is, of course, a widow.''She also argued that Mrs. Allison
``suffered a series of physical blows, of physical abuse.''
   Grant, however, argued that Mrs. Allison gave ``no warning,
none, didn't say a word, just shot him'' _ and therefore was
disqualified from a self-defense acquittal.

<HEAD>Berlin Conductor Suffers Circulatory Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALZBURG, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berlin Philharmonic conducter Herbert
von Karajan suffered blood circulation problems and was unable to
conduct tonight at the annual Salzburg cultural festival,
organizers said.
   In a statement issued to news organizations, festival organizers
said ``extreme climatic conditions'' gave the 80-year-old conductor
``a massive circulatory weakness of a dangerous extent.''
   Festival spokesman Hans Widrich said von Karajan was resting at
his home in Anif, a Salzburg suburb, on doctor's orders.
   Asked whether the maestro was conscious, Widrich said, ``Of
course, he asked that the press statement (about the cancellation)
be read to him.''
   He cited ``the great heat which causes problems for many people,
above all for those who are not that young any more.''
   ``Secondly, it is very hot in the festival hall and there is no
air conditioning in the orchestra pit. It is for that reason that
the doctor did not allow Mr. von Karajan'' to conduct Mozart's
opera Don Giovanni tonight.
   Widrich said organizers were confident von Karajan, who ranks
among the world's top conductors, would be able to direct scheduled
concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic in Salzburg Aug. 27 and 28.
   He also expressed some hope that von Karajan might conduct at
least one of two other Don Giovanni performances scheduled for next
week, when the weather is expected to be cooler.
   Von Karajan, the ``director for life'' of the the Berlin
Philharmonic and Salzburg's second most famous son after Mozart,
has conducted regularly at the Salzburg festival since 1948.
   He has been in frail health after years of illness. He also has
had trouble walking to the podium because of serious back problems.
   Organizers said von Karajan's longtime assistant, Bruno Weil,
would direct the Mozart opera at the Salzburg Festival House
tonight.

   A Kremlin commission investigating Stalinist
repressions has cleared 636 people and will expose those who
``blindly fulfilled inhumane instructions,'' the Communist Party
daily Pravda reported today.
   Mikhail S. Solomentsev, a member of the ruling 13-member party
Politburo, detailed some of the commission's work in a lengthy
interview published on the newspaper's front page.
   The commission he heads was established at a party Central
Committee meeting in October 1987 ``for further examination of
materials connected with the repressions that took place in the
1930s-1940s and the early 1950s.''
   Those dates refer to the 29-year dictatorship of Josef Stalin,
accused by Western historians of being responsible for the deaths
of up to 20 million people.
   ``Many people are guilty of the abuses: some of them were named,
some not,'' Solomentsev told Pravda. ``The measure of the guilt of
every one of them will be determined.''
   After Stalin's death in 1953, Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev
launched the first review of the repressions, but Solomentsev said
the work was not completed and did not cover abuses committed
before 1934.
   He said the commission has at its disposal all materials
contained in the Soviet archives and will complete a thorough
review of the historical records that detail Stalin's actions. He
appealed to the public for information that might help the inquiry.
   Solomentsev said 636 people had already been cleared of crimes
by the commission because accusations against them were unfounded,
and that many other cases are still under review.
   ``We are equally interested in the fate of prominent leaders of
the party and the Soviet state and the rank and file citizens _
workers, peasants, office workers, party, government and economic
functionaries, intellectuals,'' he said.
   Among Stalin's victims were hundreds of thousands of Crimean
Tatars and ethnic Germans who were accused during World War II of
collaborating with Nazi occupiers.
   Stalin also led the brutal drive for collectivization of
agriculture in the 1930s, when peasants who refused to leave their
land for state farms were shot as examples to others and hundreds
of thousands perished in the famine years that followed.
   ``The personal guilt of Stalin and the people closest to him
before the party and people for the mass repressions and
lawlessness is dreadful,'' Solomentsev told Pravda.
   ``But the guilt of the leaders does not relieve of
responsibility the voluntary executors, those directly involved in
the infringement of socialist law, those who supported and blindly
fulfilled inhumane instructions, committed outrages,'' he said.
   Solomentsev said the burial places of many of Stalin's victims
may never be discovered. A Soviet newspaper, however, reported this
week that the graves of 500 of the victims had been discovered near
Minsk, the Byelorussian capital.
   Among those whose names have been cleared this year of criminal
charges made against them by Stalin's prosecutors are prominent
Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev. Each
was a major figure in the 1920s and a rival for the power that
Stalin took for himself.
   They and many other prominent figures either were shot or died
in prison camps during Stalin's purges of the 1930s.
   Solomentsev said an investigation also had been launched into
the assassination in December 1934 of Leningrad party leader Sergei
Kirov.
   Kirov was a popular party figure who opposed Stalin's rule. Some
Western historians believe Stalin was responsible for Kirov's
death, but accused other opponents of the crime in an effort to
destroy them.
   Western reference books say more than 100 people were executed
after being accused of involvement in a plot to kill Kirov.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Resident Crashes Ambulance He `Borrowed' to Get a

<DATELINE>CONROE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pajama-clad nursing home resident who
wanted a sandwich took off in an idling ambulance and crashed into
a garage door about a mile away.
   ``I guess my first thought was, `Why is there an ambulance in my
driveway?' The second thought was, `This can't be the real driver.'
I mean he looked elderly and a little dazed,'' said Margaret
Hataway, who awoke about 3:30 a.m. Thursday to the sound of
squealing tires and a revved-up engine.
   The crash came an eye-blink later. The ambulance demolished her
garage door and the Cadillac parked inside was scratched from
flying glass.
   Donald Edwards, 79, a resident of the Woodland Manor Nursing
Home about a mile from Hataway's house, was uninjured in the crash
and faces no charges. He has been returned to the nursing home.
   ``He said all he wanted was a sandwich, and he couldn't figure
out why no one would give him one,'' said Pat Pechacek, owner of
the stolen ambulance.
   The ambulance was called to the nursing home to transport an
elderly woman complaining of chest pains. The woman was taken to
the hospital by another ambulance and was doing fine, Pechacek said.
   Pechacek, who had gone to the nursing home with his partner to
pick up the woman, said he now has a new policy for employees at
the County Wide Ambulance Service:
   ``Turn the engine off, and take the keys with you.''

   Burma's attorney general, Maung Maung,
today was named president and chairman of Burma's ruling party. The
U.S.-educated lawyer, the nation's first civilian leader in 26
years, immediately called for reforms.
   But student leaders rejected the choice of Maung Maung, who is
seen as a figurehead for the military, and called for a nationwide
strike to press for an end to one-party rule, said a Western
diplomat in Rangoon, the capital.
   Students led bloody street demonstrations on Aug. 8-12 that
ended the 17-day rule of Maung Maung's hard-line predecessor, Sein
Lwin.
   Burma's official Radio Rangoon said Maung Maung, 63, was
selected during emergency meetings of the central committee of the
Burma Socialist Program Party and of the People's Assembly, Burma's
parliament. The radio was monitored in Bangkok.
   In a radio speech, Maung Maung later urged the party central
committee to fulfill the people's aspirations ``as soon as possible
and as much as possible.''
   ``We need to review ourselves'' because the violent
demonstrations showed that ``consultation with the people became
weakened,'' he said.
   He said the ``severe storm'' of protests hit the nation while
``fundamental economic and political reforms'' were being debated.
   Maung Maung said it has been almost a year since former party
chairman Ne Win spoke of the need for economic reform. He said some
youths have been deprived of opportunities to study and that
efforts are being made at educational reforms.
   The Western diplomat said by telephone from Rangoon: ``Students
have called for a nationwide strike on Monday. They're agitating
for abolition of one-party rule. The more militant (student)
leaders are disappointed.''
   He said students called for the strike in leaflets circulated
during a peaceful rally in front of Rangoon General Hospital.
Japan's Kyodo news service, reporting from Rangoon, said 15,000
people took part in the rally.
   Kyodo also said 100,000 people marched in the northern city of
Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, in the second straight
day of mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Kyodo said provincial
government workers walked off of their jobs to join the
demonstration. The city's population is 600,000.
   Maung Maung is one of only two civilians in the top ranks of the
government hierarchy.
   His selection was a surprise. Most Burma watchers had predicted
the new party boss would be chosen from among the clique of active
and retired top military officers who supported former leader Ne
Win's system of rigid socialist economics, strict military control
and international isolation.
   Maung Maung is considered a relative moderate, and thought more
acceptable than other figures to Burmese who took to the streets in
waves in the past two weeks to topple Sein Lwin and press demands
for an end to a quarter-century of military dominated,
authoritarian rule.
   The government said 95 people were killed last week in battles
between security forces and anti-government demonstrators, but
diplomats said hundreds may have been killed.
   After Burma gained independence in 1948, Maung Maung studied at
Rangoon University. He later received a doctorate in international
law from Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a law degree
from Yale University, where he spent two years as a visiting
lecturer in the early 1960s.
   After the 1962 coup, he served as Ne Win's legal adviser. He was
elected to the party central committee at the first party congress
in 1972, and in 1974 became a member of the State Council, the
highest state organ.
   In a 1974 autobiography, ``To a Soldier Son,'' he wrote
admiringly of the military but also praised the ideals of youthful
activism. He is seen as a figurehead for military powerbrokers but
a leader who can calm the protests.
   Maung Maung was elected to the party's Central Executive
Committee in 1977 and was considered the country's fifth-ranked
leader. He resigned from that post in 1985, and later became
attorney general.
   The only other civilian in the military-dominated government is
Education Minister Kyaw Sein.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said the capital was calm but that
military forces were deployed around the Pyithu Hluttaw, the
Parliament building in northwestern Rangoon.
   Sein Lwin is a former army general criticized for his brutal
suppression of dissidents. He replaced Ne Win, who took power in a
1962 coup and ruled the country for 26 years until his resignation.
   Since Sein Lwin's ouster, various activist groups have
circulated leaflets and posters, presented formal statements to the
government, and held street rallies to demand greater democracy.
   Brang Seng, leader of the Kachin guerrilla army and vice
president of the National Democratic Front of 10 rebel groups, told
Kyodo today that the front ``will join the students and citizens
fighting in the movement for democracy to establish a provisional
government for national reconciliation.''
   ``As long as the one-party dictatorship continues, we will
continue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the (next)
leader,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Protesters' demands include a multi-party system, economic
reforms, release of political prisoners and restoration of student
organizations.
   Under Ne Win, Burma was transformed from one of Southeast Asia's
wealthiest countries to one of its poorest, rivaled only by
communist-ruled Laos and Cambodia. Rampant inflation, food
shortages and other economic hardships fueled popular resentment
against the government.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen
said today that Republicans put on a convention for the far right
in New Orleans, ``a Mardi Gras for the Moral Majority.''
   ``The hard right drove the Republican agenda,'' Bentsen told a
news conference as he neared the end of a nine-day campaign trip to
his home state, where he planned to welcome running mate Michael
Dukakis tonight to the Texas hustings.
   ``What we saw was the Republicans putting on a convention for
the far right,'' Bentsen said. ``They had a Mardi Gras for the
Moral Majority.''
   Bentsen was asked about a report in today's Washington Post that
his blind trust invested in his son's business after being steered
there by the senator.
   He said he reported the trust's investment in his son's company.
``Frankly, I didn't have to report it,'' Bentsen said.
   He said his wife's position as a trustee on a mutual fund
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the
blind trust. ``No, not at all, absolutely not,'' he said.
   He said his wife was one of the directors representing the
stockholders and not the management. ``It's almost an adversarial
relationship,'' he said.
   Bentsen told reporters his blind trust was approved by the
Senate Ethics Committee.
   Earlier, Bentsen's spokesman, Jack DeVore, said the trust was
handled properly and the senator did not know about the son's
investment until after it was done.
   Bentsen began the day by contrasting his running mate with the
opposition ticket of Bush and Dan Quayle.
   ``Mike Dukakis has reached out to the center and he is saying to
Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan, `come home','' Bentsen said
in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''.
   He said ``I thought George Bush had a well-crafted speech and
that he did a good job delivering it.'' But, he said, Bush did not
note that the national debt and the trade deficit have soared
during the eight years of the Reagan administration, evidence of
what Bentsen called a ``credit-card mentality.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen arranged to meet here tonight for a
fund-raiser and then visit the LBJ ranch and President Johnson's
widow, Lady Bird, on Saturday. The joint appearances were designed
to underline the importance Democrats place on the Lone Star state,
which Bush also claims as home.
   Bentsen flew to Texas a week ago and has been criss-crossing the
state on behalf of Dukakis, selling the ticket to skeptical Texans,
most of whom are more conservative than the Massachusetts governor.
   The Texas senator planned to continue that effort today before
supporters in Wichita Falls and during a visit to a Texas
Instruments plant in Sherman before returning at day's end to
Dallas.
   Bentsen began Thursday in Tyler in East Texas, explaining to his
long-time Senate supporters why he was seeking both re-election to
that seat and the vice presidency.
   He met in Kilgore with oilmen, a conservative group, and
promised that he would continue to fight for them in Washington as
vice president with the same verve as he has in the Senate.
   He also spoke before the East Texas Regional Development Group,
an audience of more than 500 businessmen and women, mostly
Republican.
   ``They were attentive and they were polite. I think we made some
headway,'' he said after the appearance. To win Texas' 29 electoral
votes, Bentsen says, Democrats who voted for Reagan must ``come
home to the Democratic Party.''
   When he flew to Dallas at day's end, Bentsen met the other end
of the political spectrum _ one that might find him a tad too
conservative. Both Bentsen and the Jesse Jackson supporters he
talked with said they were pleased with the encounter.
   ``It went quite well,'' Bentsen said. Although problems
remained, ``In campaigns, there are always those things. We did
very well.''
   John Wiley Price, a Dallas county commissioner and a Jackson
supporter who walked out of the Democrats' convention in Atlanta,
said Bentsen went a long way toward alleviating his concerns about
black participation in the campaign and bringing him on the
bandwagon.
   ``Sen. Bentsen agreed they can't win without Jackson, so he is
going to make sure these needs are going to be discussed,'' Price
said.
   Bentsen planned to leave Texas on Saturday, flying to Florida
for a Democratic Party dinner before returning to Washington.

   They were relegated to supporting roles, but
some lesser known Republican faces were given convention exposure
this week and can be counted among the party's leaders for the
future.
   Names like Phil Gramm, who described himself as doing ``the
Lord's work in the devil's city.'' And Olympia Snowe, who wielded
the gavel with humor and aplomb. And Tom Kean, who scored the
Democrats for ``pastel patriotism.''
   Political conventions are expected to make and end political
careers, and this one made Dan Quayle what George Bush said he was:
one of the party's ``rising young stars.''
   Unless, that is, he proves to be a shooting star.
   If Quayle meets the challenge of his lofty new role, the young
and conservative junior senator from Indiana may pose a roadblock
for some of the party's other aspirants to the mantle of Ronald
Reagan.
   But while Quayle was battling to prove his worthiness against a
barrage of questions about his military record and experience, some
Republicans who were passed over for the vice presidential
nomination can already be counted among the winners and losers of
the convention.
   Gramm, the Texas senator who only five years ago was a Democrat
and is widely assumed to have presidential aspirations, is a
possible inheritor of leadership of the Republicans' right wing.
   He was given a prominent spot at the convention, delivering the
speech that placed Bush's name in nomination. Gramm did a credible
job, delivered some good lines _ and avoided the pitfall of
Democratic nominator Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who talked
on and on in introducing Michael Dukakis.
   Kean, the New Jersey governor and convention keynoter, had to
contend with a minor protest by Republican ideologues who objected
to such a prominent role being given to someone who didn't share
their opposition to abortion.
   Kean preaches what is called the politics of inclusion, and
bringing minorities into the party. In Republican Party politics,
his future depends in part on the party's willingness to accept
moderates.
   ``I thought Tom Kean did a good job,'' said Dan Casey, executive
director of the American Conservative Union, a conservative
organization. ``There was no down side at all.''
   Kean battles an image problem that results from an aristocrat's
accent. But he told a Superdome filled largely with affluent whites
that the party of Abraham Lincoln must reach out to the
``ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed.''
   Snowe, the Maine congresswoman, was part of a parade of
Republicans afforded a moment on the platform. She demonstrated
that the party has a bench deep with potential leaders.
   John McCain brought the convention crowd to its feet for the
first standing ovation of the convention. A first-term senator from
Arizona who is solid with the party's conservative wing, McCain
recalled his 5{ years spent in a North Vietnamese prison.
   Pat Robertson, who as a candidate never lived up to the
expectations some had for his ``religious right'' movement, gave a
ho-hum speech. But he helped himself among the party's
establishment by maintaining a low profile and playing the good
soldier.
   Some who were passed over for the vice presidential nomination
looked like winners just because they were considered: Sen. Pete
Dominici of New Mexico, who has pushed his party to deal with the
deficit, and Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, whose selection likely
would have angered conservatives.
   The convention had its losers, too.
   Jack Kemp is the most obvious. The New York congressman spent
eight years running for president and lobbied hard to become Bush's
running mate. Now he is giving up his congressional seat.
   ``We believe with all our hearts that there is a role to play
for Jack Kemp and our ideas in the future of the Republican
Party,'' Kemp said. Others aren't so sure.
   Bill Bennett, former Education secretary and a big draw on the
GOP fund-raising circuit, gave a flat speech in a monotone that the
delegates barely listened to.
   Former U.N. Secretary Jeane Kirkpatrick, who electrified the
1984 GOP convention by condemning ``the San Francisco Democrats,''
stuck to her style. But her words seemed to get lost in the
cavernous superdome.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas gave a crowd-pleasing speech. But his
remarks about the vice presidential selection process _ while he
was being selected out _ sounded sour. Dole complained that the
selection process, in which the Bush campaign tried to heighten
suspense by keeping the nominee's name secret, was demeaning.
   The Superdome, where the convention was held, itself was a
loser. All were delighted at the spacious accommodations _ until
the convention began. On television it was fine, but inside
delegates could hardly hear. So much for conventions on football
fields.
   And there was another loser: Atlanta.
   Yes, the Republican convention was mostly dull. But New Orleans
can throw a party that the Democrats, who met a month ago in
Georgia, could only imagine.

<HEAD>City Should Benefit From GOP Convention For 20 Years</HEAD>

   New Orleans let the good times roll when the
Republican National Convention came to town, and it should reap the
benefits of a week of national exposure for 20 years, local
officials said.
   ``New Orleans has never looked better, Louisiana has never
looked brighter,'' said Jim Bob Moffett, head o the Fortune 500
company Freeport-McMoRan, and a key convention fund-raiser.
   The city _ public and private _ rolled out its plushest carpet
for the GOP visitors with sumptuous parties, native cuisine,
riverboat rides and Gov. Buddy Roemer reminding everyone the state
was polishing its tarnished image.
   ``Sooner or later the message was going to come across that New
Orleans is not strictly a party town or a place for good food and
music,'' said David Jones, president of the New Orleans Chamber of
Commerce. ``We are starting to do the right things to make this a
viable economic center.''
   Local boosters raved about the success of the four-day
convention, which ended Thursday, and by most accounts the
complaints were minimal.
   But then New Orleans handles Mardi Gras every year with 20 times
as many visitors and a different type of crowd, police said.
   ``At Mardi Gras ... it's a party crowd and there are a few more
untoward incidents,'' said New Orleans police Capt. John Hughes.
``It was very good as far as we're concerned.''
   Suffocating humidity and 90-degree temperatures made it too hot
to misbehave, Hughes said.
   New Orleans' subtropical weather and the sound system installed
by the Republicans in the giant Louisiana Superdome seemed to cause
the most dissatisfaction.
   Technicians began adjusting the system after Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the GOP's 1964 presidential nominee, said he couldn't
hear a word of President Reagan's farewell speech Monday.
   The complaints diminished during the week, but they didn't go
away.
   ``It is not the Superdome system,'' Dome manager Bob Johnson was
quick to point out of the special sound equipment installed by the
Republican convention team.
   There was at least one report of ``hotel hell'' from the New
York delegation, who found parts of their ceiling on the floor and
uncooperative sinks, tubs and toilets.
   ``I'm used to roughing it, but when you can't flush the
toilet,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, letting his sentence finish
itself. ``I just couldn't work without the basic needs being
fulfilled.''
   And some of the more conservative delegates were not charmed by
New Orleans' tolerance for the weird, the drunk and the sexy.
   ``Now that we have visited Sodom, where is Gomorrah?'' one
Washington state delegate was reported asking.
   But others were seduced by the history, the easy-going attitude
and the Mighty Mississippi.
   ``Even streetwise cab drivers (were) on their best behavior this
week. Lots of pleases and thank yous, complete with accurate meters
and air conditioning systems that work,'' the Daily Oklahoman noted.
   ``Our goal was to put together one of the most successful
conventions in history,'' said Jones, the chamber president.
   Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy said he was hard pressed to find anyone who
wasn't enamored of the French Quarter, the streetcars and the
oak-lined avenues.
   ``I don't believe that we could have spent $1 billion in
advertising and reaped the benefits equal to the fantastic free
press, the free media, we are receiving,'' Hardy said.
   ``It will probably have gains for Louisiana for the next 20
years,'' said Mervin Trail, a New Orleans businessman and another
key fund-raiser.

   Radio Uganda had a late-breaking
development on its evening newscast, but the announcer didn't stay
on the air to let his listeners know what happened.
   Veteran newscaster Francis Bbaale was winding up the 10 p.m.
news bulletin Wednesday when a five-foot snake slithered into his
broadcast booth, the Ministry of Information said Friday.
   ``Oh my God! ... Good night!'' the excited newsman told
listeners just before the radio station went off with air without
explanation four minutes before the scheduled end of the 15-minute
broadcast.
   Station employees killed the snake. They did not say what kind
it was.
   Programming resumed Thursday morning, but officials didn't
explain the interrupted broadcast until Friday, after newspapers
carried reports on the incident.

   About six tons of magazines, letters and
free samples, some more than three years old, were found in the
home of a mail carrier, but his customers apparently never missed
the missing mail, officials said.
   ``I've seen this type of thing before, but never of this
magnitude,'' said postal investigator Richard Jordan. ``Right now,
we're overwhelmed.''
   Authorities responding to a tip from a neighbor raided the
carrier's home Monday and found the undelivered mail, some of it
badly deteriorated and infested with bugs, piled in the house,
packed into a storage shed and littering the surrounding woods.
   It was believed to be one of the largest mail thefts in U.S.
history, said a postal investigator who didn't want to be
identified because he works undercover. Dean Nichols, a postal
inspector in Birmingham, Ala., said he was unsure whether it was
the largest because the Postal Service does not keep records of
mail thefts.
   Investigators used a front-end loader to scoop up the mail,
hauling away ``several truckloads'' by Thursday. But authorities
could give no precise estimate of how much had been seized, except
that it had filled 16 3-by-3-by-4-feet deep postal bins.
   Postal bins hold about 250 pounds of mail, meaning that roughly
two tons had been hauled off.
   Jordan said about 32 bins full of mail _ or four tons _ remained
to be collected today. About 500 to 600 pieces of first-class mail
were among the items found.
   ``We amazed ourselves when we found more today,'' he said
Thursday after a trek in the woods surrounding the house. Examples
of the bulk mail included sweepstakes envelopes and diaper samples.
   The name of the mail carrier was not released, but he works out
of the Pensacola office and lives in Milton. He has been placed on
administrative leave pending charges, officials said.
   The pieces of first-class mail are being retained as evidence.
Investigators are sorting the remaining bulk mail and contacting
each recipient to see if they still want it delivered. The rest
will be destroyed.
   ``We hate to destroy it, but some is just undeliverable. It's
something I never thought I'd see,'' Jordan said.
   Pensacola Postmaster Ben Jasek said he was surprised the
carrier's 500 rural customers didn't notice any mail missing. The
post office never received any complaints to tip them off, he said.
   ``This is a fluke. All I can say is that rural carriers are kind
of their own entity,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Sir Frederick Ashton, one of the world's greatest
ballet choreographers, died in his sleep, The Royal Opera House
said today. He was 83.
   Ashton, who received a knighthood in 1962 for his work, died
Thursday night at his country house in the Suffolk region,
northeast of London, said Margaret Skeet, spokeswoman for the Opera
House, parent company to The Royal Ballet.
   No cause of death was given.
   ``We have lost one of the world's greatest choreographers,''
said Sir John Tooley, outgoing director of The Royal Opera House.
``He was nothing less than a genius and his contribution to the
development of ballet in this country ... is beyond words.''
   Ashton's creations ranged from the ballet-comedy ``A Wedding
Bouquet'' to ``Cinderella'' in 1948, the first three-act ballet
created for a British company. He also created dances for operas,
films, musical comedies and revues.
   ``Nobody could create a more touchingly tender love duet than
he,'' said a press release issued by The Royal Ballet, with whom he
worked for more than two decades including seven years as director
ending in 1970.
   ``But there is something Shakespearian about the way he could
move within a single work from sweet lyricism to knock-about comedy
or delicately barbed wit,'' it said.
   As well as a knighthood, Ashton was awarded a Companion of Honor
in 1970, the Order of Merit in 1977, and admission to the French
Legion of Honor in 1962.
   Born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in September 1904 to British
parents, he grew up in Peru. After seeing Anna Pavlova perform in
Lima in 1917, he fell in love with ballet and wanted to become a
dancer.
   But he wasn't able to begin studying the art until years later,
when he took up ballet classes against his family's wishes after
his graduation from an English private school.
   His first commission was for a small ballet called ``A Tragedy
of Fashion,'' created for a revue in 1926.
   In 1931, he did his first work for Dame Ninette de Valois,
beginning a longtime working relationship with her and the company
she fostered which grew into the Royal Ballet.
   They drew inspiration from English painters and music for a
style marked by ``poise, purity, (and) freshness,'' the Royal
Ballet statement said.
   His best-known ballets include ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Ondine,''
``Marguerite and Armand,'' and ``Daphnis and Chloe.''
   Asked once what was the inspiration, he told The Times of
London: ``I don't know ... I am fairly religious. I rather put
myself in the hands of a superior power ... I am almost like a
wireless (radio).''
   He was unmarried, and the ballet statement did not mention
survivors.
   No date for services was immediately announced.

   A teen-ager accused of raping and murdering
his 76-year-old grandmother when he returned home from a drinking
party was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in
prison.
   ``He didn't kill his grandmother; drugs and alcohol did,''
defense lawyer Richard Lawson said before a Circuit Court jury
announced its verdict Thursday against Jason Ungethum, 17.
   ``If Jason had intended to kill his grandmother, especially in
the way he did, he's the lowest form of life. That's not consistent
with the Jason who loved his grandmother,'' said Lawson, who had
argued for a second-degree murder conviction.
   District Attorney Brian Pawlak told the jury Lawson was using an
alcohol defense to try to cloud the issue. ``Alcohol simply allows
somebody with suppressed criminal tendencies to bring them to the
surface,'' Pawlak said.
   The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence
of life in prison. Ungethum was also sentenced to five years for
sexual assault. He will be elgible to apply for parole in about 16
years.
   A Langlade County deputy sheriff testified that Ungethum
admitting quarreling with his grandmother when he arrived at her
apartment after a party Jan. 31.
   Ungethum drank at least eight beers and five shots of whiskey at
the party, Lawson said. There also was evidence he smoked
marijuana, took the drug mescaline and was susceptible to
blackouts, the attorney said.
   Mrs. Rock's body was found Feb. 2 by Sheila Ungethum, the
victim's daughter and the defendant's mother. The woman had
suffered blows to the head and been strangled and her throat was
slashed.

<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, whose family controls a $1 billion newspaper empire, voted
last year to exempt newsprint from a new federal tax on most
imported products.
   Newsprint, the paper on which newspapers are printed, accounts
for as much as 25 percent to 35 percent of the cost of putting out
a daily.
   Although the Indiana senator could have decided not to vote on
the issue, as members sometimes do in cases involving a conflict of
interest, Quayle voted with the losing side when the Senate, by a
69-29 margin, killed the proposed exemption.
   Quayle's immediate family owns the Huntington (Ind.)
Herald-Press. His father is publisher; the senator is vice
president.
   Quayle's most recent financial disclosure statement shows he
owns stock in Central Newspapers, Inc., with a book value of more
than $250,000. The law does not require a more specific figure, but
newspaper industry anaylsts say his stock is worth millions.
   His wife has Central stock with a book value of $100,001 to
$250,000.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted Eugene S. Pulliam, son of the
founder of Central, as saying Quayle owns less than 1 percent of
Central stock. The Journal said a group of investors offered to buy
Central earlier this yer for $1.5 billion.
   Quayle is a grandson of the founder of Central Newspapers,
Eugene C. Pulliam. The group includes the Arizona Republic, Phoenix
Gazette, Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis News.
   Senators generally are required to vote on each issue facing the
Senate, although a member may asked to be excused. However, Senate
Rule XII, Paragraph 3 states: ``A member, nothwithstanding any
other provisons of this rule, may decline to vote, in committee or
on the floor, on any matter when he believes that his voting on
such amatter would be a conflict of interest.''
   In the book, Senate Procedure, page 1137: ``Under the newly
amended rule XII, relative to senators not having to vote when a
conflict of interest is involved, the senator from North Carolina
(Mr. Helms) on a vote in 1980 on an anmendment involving
broadcasting companies declined to vote since he owned stock in a
broadcasting company.''
   Quayle's vote on the newspaper exemption occurred July 21, 1987,
shortly before the Senate passed a bill overhauling U.S. trade laws.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., offered an amendment exempting
newspapers from the import fee that would be used to pay special
unemployment benefits and other assistance to U.S. workers and
companies harmed by imports.
   ``Since 1913, newsprint has been duty-free,'' Daschle told the
Senate. ``To impose a duty at this time would be a terrible
precedent.... They are dependent upon the importation of a
significant amount of newspring.... It would have a devastating
effect.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., called the proposed exemption ``clearly
a special-interest amendment'' and said the newspaper industry's
case for such a break ``is no better than anyone else's.... If we
exempt the publishers,'' Heinz added, ``other industries will have
to make up that lost revenue.''
   Heinz disputed newspaper industry estimates that the new fee
would cost newspapers $40 million a year. He said a $4 million
estimate would be much closer to reality, since the trade bill
limited the amount of trade adjustment assistance that could be
paid, and, thus, the amount of import tax that could be imposed.
   Quayle did not speak on the amendment. Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., quickly moved to table it, and the Senate agreed, by the
69-29 vote.
   Quayle's Democratic opponent for the vice presidency, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas, also voted for the newspaper exemption. But as
far as can be determined, Bentsen has no financial interest in any
newspaper.
   The 1987 trade bill eventually was vetoed by President Reagan
for other reasons. The revised version that Congress recently sent
to the president _ and still is awaiting his signature _ requires
negotiations with trading partners leading to a small fee on
imports.
   The president would have two years to negotiate a fee agreeable
to all trading partners. If the negotiations fail, the president
would have to impose it unilaterally or tell Congress why not.
Congress then could pass legislation imposing the fee.

<HEAD>Think Tank Says AIDS Infections May Be Twice Federal Estimates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Americans infected with the AIDS
virus may be twice the federal estimates, and infection among the
heterosexual population may be three times as high, according to a
report released today by the Hudson Institute, a privately-financed
research organization.
   Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson Institute mathematician, said a study
using more sophisticated techniques than are used by the Centers
for Disease Control shows that as many as 3 million Americans may
be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS.
   The high estimate by the CDC, which is the prime federal agency
monitoring the spread of AIDS, is that about 1.4 million are
infected with the virus.
   ``A best guess at the range of total infections as of year-end
1987 (was) from 1.9 million to 3 million persons, with the
likeliest range between 2.2 million and 2.6 million people,'' the
Hudson study reported.
   Over half of the cases are among homosexual men, Hopkins said,
but estimates the number of heterosexuals infected by the virus may
be three times higher than the CDC estimate.
   The institute estimates that 850,000 to 1.4 million
heterosexuals are infected with the HIV virus and that 200,000 to
500,000 of this number are heterosexuals who don't use drugs.
   ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,'' said
Hopkins. ``A break out into the non-monogamous population is
unavoidable.''
   The CDC has estimated that the AIDS virus has infected only
80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that can be spread through sexual contact, through the
sharing of needles such as in drug abuse, through infected blood
transfusions or organ transplants, and from birthing mother to
child.
   Hopkins said the Hudson Institute AIDS estimates differ from
those of CDC because different computer models were used and
because ``more sophisticated'' statistical analysis techniques were
applied to the model.
   ``We're all in a guessing game,'' Hopkins admitted. ``CDC is
trying to do its best. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be
complacent about his disease.''
   As of Aug. 8, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 39,620, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The Hudson study concentrated on the projections of those now
infected with HIV, but who have not progressed to AIDS, which is
the end stage of the infection. AIDS is known to develop from three
to eight years after infection. Persons infected with HIV are
capable of spreading the virus before they actually develop AIDS.
For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of
infection in order to gauge the future size of the epidemic.

<TEXT>
   Singer John Denver, who has sought
unsuccessfully to be a passenger on the U.S. space shuttle, has
asked the Soviet Union for a ride aboard its Mir space station, an
industry magazine reported Friday.
   Aviation Week & Space Technology said Denver had requested
transportation to Mir aboard one of the Soyuz spaceships that
regularly carry crews to and from the orbiting station.
   ``The Soviets,'' the magazine said, ``responded with two
conditions. They told Denver they would charge him $10 million for
the ride and that he had to get permission from the U.S. government.
   ``The State Department took its customary cautious approach,
advising Denver it was taking `no position' on the matter _
effectively putting it back into the hands of the Soviets,''
Aviation Week said.
   The magazine quoted an unidentified American official as saying,
``We very carefully did not endorse his going, but at the same time
we can't prevent U.S. citizens from going to exotic places.''
   Denver has been a guest of NASA at several space shuttle
launches and has asked several times over the years for a shuttle
ride, saying he wanted to compose in orbit a song about space.

   Wilmer Grier is spending her days in court
defending her client in a mob-related drug and racketeering trial,
but she's spent the last few nights in a federal jail.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen cited Ms. Grier for contempt
for refusing to appear in court Wednesday, when she was treated at
a hospital for injuries suffered in a minor traffic accident.
According to court transcripts, he ordered her to spend seven
nights behind bars.
   The judge said Ms. Grier had been late to court repeatedly _ a
claim she disputed _ and said he wanted to guarantee her presence
at the trial of her client, Timothy Smith. Smith and four other
people are charged with racketeering and distributing heroin.
   Owen's action ``was an insult,'' Ms. Grier, 47, said Thursday.
``I didn't have any credibility with the judge, maybe because I'm
black.''
   Ms. Grier said she was dragged briefly by a taxi Wednesday when
her backpack got caught in the door. She went to a hospital and
told the judge by telephone that she was not coming to court
because she could not maneuver her crutches.
   According to the transcript unsealed Thursday, Owen also asked a
nurse at the hospital about the lawyer's condition. Ms. Grier then
went home instead of to court. U.S. marshals took her to court.
   Owen, known for strictness in his court, stressed that Ms. Grier
had refused to adhere to an order to come to court. He cited
repeated lateness and ordered her detention ``so I know where you
will be.''
   ``This has been a very difficult trial. It's, I guess, affected
all of us,'' Owen said in court Wednesday.
   Ms. Grier told Owen on Wednesday that she felt ``jinxed by the
whole case. Everyday something is happening to me with this case
and I can't get finished.''
   But the judge said he wondered ``whether this is some effort to
get this jury to the point where it is going to give up, whether
this is something that is in your makeup that I don't understand.''
   The case is in summation.

   The hostage drama that ended Thursday left three
people dead and a host of questions about police handling of the
episode. Here is a reconstruction of the two-day odyssey, based on
interviews with the gunmen and victims, official accounts and media
reports.

   Silke Bischof, smiling faintly despite
a loaded revolver pointed at her chest, says she's all right but
afraid police will act suddenly to end her hostage nightmare, and
``somebody will be killed again.''
   Two hours later, the blond teen-ager whose face was flashed
across the world's TV screens and newspapers is dead. A bandit has
shot her through the heart during a final gunbattle with police on
a crowded highway near the West German capital.
   The bizarre, 54-hour drama begins when two gunmen with long
criminal records storm a branch of the Deutsche Bank in the
northwestern town of Gladbeck, barricading themselves inside and
taking two hostages.
   ``Sure, the situation is tense,'' one of the gunmen tells local
radio station FFN in a telephone interview at 2 p.m. Tuesday, about
six hours after the siege has begun.
   Asked what will happen if authorities don't give in to their
demands for money and a getaway car, the gunman says: ``Then we'll
all have to die.''
   The gunmen, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and Dieter Degowski, 32,
are shabbily dressed and covered with tattoos. They appear to have
been taking drugs or drinking.
   Late in the evening, after a day of failed police attempts to
free the hostages, the bandits scoop up $227,000, shove their two
hostages into an Audi sedan provided by authorities, and drive away.
   For two hours, police chase them through the Ruhr industrial
area. They commandeer a BMW and police lose them. Somewhere along
the way, the bandits pick up female accomplice Marion Irma
Loeblich, 34. They vanish until the next day.
   Late Wednesday afternoon, the bandits reach the northern port
city of Bremen, about 55 miles southwest of Hamburg. During a
shooting spree in a vegetable market, they commandeer a city bus
and take about 30 passengers as captives.
   After about 15 minutes, four elderly passangers and one young
child leave the bus.
   ``I simply stood up, no one stopped me,'' said Konrad
Hofrichter, an 83-year-old retiree. One elderly woman gets off and
simply walks across the platform to catch a trolley home.
   West Germany's ARD television network twice interrupts its
evening newscast with bulletins on the unfolding events. TV viewers
see no police near the hijacked bus.
   Meanwhile, the three bandits walk around with guns in hand,
chatting with reporters and occasionally gazing into the sky at a
police helicopter monitoring them.
   Inside, 15-year-old Emanuele de Giorgi sits with his arm around
his little sister, and Silke Bischof sits bolt upright and stares.
Both will soon be dead.
   Negotiations with police break down. Roesner brings out a young
girl, holds a pistol to her head and threatens to shoot if the
bandits' demands for a fast getaway car aren't met.
   Around 10 p.m., the bus takes off with about 25 hostages,
sparking a police chase that leaves one policeman dead in a car
wreck.
   Late Wednesday evening, the bus pulls up to a rest stop on the
autobahn, or highway near Bremen to get food and alcohol. The two
hostages from the bank in Gladbeck are released.
   ``I kept hoping I would be freed, but I also had to figure there
were good chances I'd simply get shot down,'' says Andrea Blecker,
a 23-year-old customer service representative.
   As the gunmen's accomplice, Ms. Loeblich, comes out from a brief
trip to the rest stop toilet brandishing a cocked pistol, police
jump her and throw her to the ground.
   Roesner and Degowski seek a victim to force her release, and
Emanuele de Giorgi reacts.
   ``Emanuele threw himself in front of his sister, to protect
her,'' said one shaken witness who declined to be identified.
   One of the gunmen, believed to be Degowski, pumps three bullets
into Emanuele and walks away from the dying youth, whose Italian
parents had come to Germany in search of a better life.
   ``Ambulance! Ambulance!'' the waiting journalists shriek as the
boy's body is dragged down the steps and onto the nearby pavement.
Twenty minutes later, an ambulance arrives. Emanuele dies in a
nearby hospital.
   At 3 a.m. Thursday, the bus crosses over into the Netherlands
and comes to a halt on the edge of a forest near the town of
Oldenzaal. All hostages except for two women are freed.
   Supplied with another BMW, the three bandits, Silke Bischof and
another hostage speed toward Amsterdam before doubling back to West
Germany.
   After getting bandages and medicines for the injured Ms.
Loeblich, Roesner drives the car into downtown Cologne shortly
after 11:30 a.m. He parks the shiny gray BMW near a pedestrian mall
where a Chilean folk music company continues a flute performance.
   Miss Bischof, an 18-year-old court stenographer from Bremen,
tells reporters she's ``all right.''
   ``I'm just afraid that the police will move in,'' she says as
Degowski points a loaded revolver at her, occasionally jamming it
into her neck. ``Then something could happen, and somebody will be
killed again.''
   Degowski, nervously chain-smoking, walks to a nearby cafe and
orders a waitress to bring coffee to the waiting car. She refuses,
so he brings it himself. Again, no uniformed police are in sight.
   Roesner, getting nervous, jumps out of the car and frantically
waves his gun around before speeding off, just as undercover police
are approaching.
   Two hours later, the police catch up, and a shootout erupts on a
crowded highway near Bonn.
   During the melee, one of the two gunmen shoots Silke in the
heart.
   Police capture Degowski, Loeblich and Roesner, who has suffered
a gunshot wound in the thigh. The second hostage is taken to the
hospital with a superficial bullet wound as police investigators
swarm the area.
   ``They just drove right into the trap,'' says witness Konrad
Anders.

   The Israeli navy fired on an unmarked boat
filled with hashish during a pre-dawn chase off the coast of Ashdod
on Friday, killing one of the six Turkish crew members and wounding
another, the army said.
   The boat aroused the suspicion of a Navy patrol which spotted it
about 2 a.m. when it failed to respond to calls to identify itself
and ignored an order to halt, the army said.
   The navy fired on the vessel during an ensuing chase and forced
the boat to dock in the Ashdod harbor, south of Tel Aviv, where two
tons of hashish were discovered on board. The crew was arrested,
the army said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Release of 1981 Revolt Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court refused to release from prison an
ailing leader of the 1981 military revolt that tested the country's
fledgling democracy, court officials said Friday.
   The three-judge tribunal ruled against former Gen. Alfonso
Armada Comin, saying the heart ailment that has hospitalized the
68-year-old prisoner does not warrant a transfer to house arrest on
humanitarian grounds.
   Armada is serving a sentence of more than 26 years for
engineering a 1981 attack on Parliament intended to trigger a
military revolt against the government of then-Prime Minister
Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo.
   The attempt took place six years after the 1975 death of Gen.
Francisco Franco ended 36 years of authoritarian rule, and three
years after King Juan Carlos approved a constitution setting up
Spain's democracy.
   A pistol-waving officer stormed parliament with 200 fellow
paramilitary civil guards, while a second plotter ordered tanks
onto the streets of Valencia for an advance on Madrid that never
materialized. The revolt was foiled early the next morning when
Juan Carlos said on national television the coup would succeed
``only over my dead body.''

   When the situation got so bad around the
Miller Street Elementary School playground that students knew the
prostitutes' names, 13-year-old Chaunta Dooley took an aunt's
advice and spoke out in public.
   ``Her call for help and assistance activated a whole
community,'' Councilman Donald Tucker said of Chaunta's action at a
January school board meeting.
   It also got her story and picture in Newsweek magazine in July
as one of ``America's Unsung Heroes'' and a medal commending her
efforts from the City Council.
   Drug traffic and a shortage of textbooks have also come to
concern Chaunta.
   ``Most young people do not take on major adult activities. Most
are very much concerned clearly with their own individual life,''
says Tucker, the councilman who nominated Chaunta for the Newsweek
honor.
   ``I just want to completely demolish the prostitution out of
this neighborhood,'' Chaunta said recently on the porch of her
family's tidy home on a street of debris-strewn lots and abandoned
cars.
   She took her call for action to the City Council, too, and now
her neighbors organize marches to harass the prostitutes and meet
regularly to discuss ways to improve their blighted blocks in New
Jersey's largest city.
   Before the campaign started, there were three or four
prostitutes soliciting business on every street corner in the
neighborhood, which attracts out-of-town customers with easy access
to major highways and Newark International Airport, police Sgt.
Donald Blydenburgh says.
   ``We've given (the area) a little extra attention and it's
improved quite a bit,'' says Blydenburgh.
   Chaunta says her reception among the prostitutes is mixed: ``The
young ones tell us to mind our own business. But the older ones are
different. They tell us not to do it and that they wouldn't if they
didn't have to.''
   The eighth-grader has noticed that more teen-agers are getting
involved in cleaning up the neighborhood and says her activism has
not cost her any friends.
   ``All the kids are so proud of her,'' says Chaunta's mother,
Gail Dooley.
   Ms. Dooley thinks her daughter got involved in her crusade at
least partly because ``she grew up in a community-minded ...
extended family.''
   Chaunta has a 14-year-old brother, Duane, and enough relatives
living nearby to organize a baseball team, her mother says.
Roseville Presbyterian Church, which the family attends, also has
been influential.
   The police have given residents a direct number to call to
report crime in the neighborhood, and officers are quick to
respond, Ms. Dooley says.
   Chaunta also speaks to student groups about drugs. An honor
student, she plays clarinet in a high school band, serves on the
student council and the cheerleader squad and participates in a
school district program for gifted teens.

   President Reagan concurs in the
actions taken by Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci on the
Navy's report on the downing of an Iranian airliner by the USS
Vincennes, the president's spokesman said today.
   Marlin Fitzwater, in Santa Barbara while the president vacations
at his ranch north of here, issued the following two-paragraph
statement:
   ``The president has been briefed on the results of the
investigation into the circumstances surrounding the downing of
Iran Air Flight 655 and concurs in the actions taken by Secretary
Carlucci. The president has been provided a copy of the report of
the investigation.
   ``This tragic accident was ultimately the result of the conflict
between Iran and Iraq which we now hope is on the verge of
settlement.''
   An administration official who asked not to be identified said
that Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
initially briefed the president during their Tuesday flight to the
West Coast from New Orleans, where Reagan had been attending the
Republican National Convention.

   A county judge who had been barred from handling
juvenile court cases because of improper contacts with delinquents
was found dead in the courthouse of an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound, officials said today.
   King County Superior Court Judge Gary M. Little knew that the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer was publishing a front-page story today
reporting that Little used his influence to have sexual relations
with young men in the 1970s, a friend of the judge said.
   Camden Hall, a lawyer and longtime friend of Little's, said the
judge called him twice Thursday threatening suicide. Hall said he
tried to get help for Little, whose body was found by a janitor
about 10 p.m. in an eighth floor hallway.
   A .38-caliber handgun and a note were found with the body, said
Police Sgt. Don Cameron, who declined to divulge the contents of
the note. The one-page, handwritten note was found on a hallway
bench and ``it gives intent,'' said Vaughn Van Zant, an
investigator with the county medical examiner's office.
   The cause of death was apparently a self-inflicted gunshot wound
to the head, said Kevin Gow, a medical investigator in the
examiner's office. An autopsy was to be performed later today.
   Little, 49, a former assistant state attorney general, announced
last month he would not seek a third term on the bench,
acknowledging that ``innuendo'' about his work with teen-age boys
was the reason.
   In 1982, the state Commission on Judicial Conduct privately
admonished Little for improper contacts with youths who had
appeared in his courtroom, such as buying them clothing and books.
Court rules bar such contacts. The commission's action was not made
public until 1985; Little was re-elected in 1984.
   In April 1985, after another complaint, Little was barred from
the juvenile court bench by the presiding judge and the Superior
Court executive committee. He was handling civil cases at the time
of his death.
   Hall said Little had been notified that the Post-Intelligencer
would publish a story today in which five men now in their mid- to
late 30s alleged that Little had used his position as an attorney
and teacher at a private school to coerce them into sexual
relations in the 1970s.
   The paper said Little refused to comment Thursday on questions
about his activities prior to being elected to the bench in 1980.
   ``If I was running for the bench, I think some of the questions
you ask me would be appropriate,'' Little said. ``But I am not. I
am leaving.''
   Hall said late Thursday that Little had telephoned him about 3
p.m., deeply distraught.
   ``He said he was going to kill himself,'' Hall said. Little
called again about 9:50 p.m. ``He said, `If you don't hear from me
in 10 minutes it will be done.'''
   After the first call threatening suicide, Hall called the county
crisis center and was referred to mental health professionals. He
said the professionals told him the best thing to do was to try to
have Little committed.
   Hall said he alerted Seattle police after Little's second call.
They arrived at the courthouse after the shooting.
   ``He said he felt he'd been hounded by the press and he just
couldn't take it anymore,'' Hall said.
   Officials at Lakeside School where Little worked said he left in
1973 on good terms and that they were unaware of any illicit
activity.

   All New York City beaches were expected to be

closed Friday because of a high bacterial count, the city said.
   All beaches at federal parks in the New York area also were open.
   Health departments of Long Island to the east and Westchester
County to the north said their state and town beaches also were
open, but some local beaches or lakes with high levels of bacterial
pollution were closed.
   New York area beaches have been closed off and on during the

<TEXT>
   The death of President Zia ul-Haq,
the army general who governed this nation for 11 years, has
prompted muted mourning and uncertainty for the future.
   In the modern capital of Islamabad and the old, adjoining city
of Rawalpindi, there is little outward sense of mass bereavement.
   ``Our religion says that when any Moslem dies, all the people
feel sorry,'' said a gray-haired shopkeeper. ``It is better not to
say more. The world goes on.''
   Zia, who seized power in a bloodless coup, ruled as a military
man although sometimes in conjunction with civilian governments,
and he inspired more respect than love.
   Many people, when asked what his death meant to them, seemed
incapable of articulating emotions. Instead, they responded with
recitations that the president had been killed, perhaps by a bomb,
as the country's newspapers have speculated. Officially, there has
been no word on the cause of the in-flight explosion that killed
Zia and 29 others Wednesday.
   Life in Islamabad and Rawalpindi without Zia conveys little more
than a mood of propriety. Flags fly at half-staff, and police and
soldiers line major streets and the route of Saturday's funeral
procession.
   The sense of dignity without emotion fits neatly in the twin
cities where street signs exhort people to ``Smile,'' ``Give a
child a book,'' and ``In case of forest fire, please ring 827227.''
   In the southern port city of Karachi, core of the political
opposition led by Benazir Bhutto, people handed out candy, a
traditional gesture of celebration in this Islamic country.
   Most of the public tears seemed confined to a crowd of women who
gathered outside Zia's residence in Rawalpindi on Thursday and to
about 50 male relatives and associates who met the coffin that
brought Zia's remains to Islamabad airport Thursday night.
   But people often spoke of their late president's strength.
   ``Zia was trying to make Pakistan a very strong country,'' high
school student Moin Qazi said as he pushed his bicycle down a
street in Rawalpindi. ``His death is a great loss.''
   Moin, the 17-year-old son of an army general, was scornful that
any civilian opposition leaders would emerge to lead the country.
   ``Benazir Bhutto is just a foolish woman,'' he said.
   At Islamabad's Aabpara market, Nazir Sheik presided over his
family's photo shop. ``Gen. Zia was very expert in dealing with
India,'' the 22-year-old man said, referring to the neighbor that
has fought three wars with Pakistan since the two countries were
partitioned upon gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
   An army captain watching security preparations at Islamabad's
Faisal mosque, where Zia's funeral will be conducted Saturday,
said: ``It is difficult to imagine Pakistan without Zia. He was
such a strong man.'' The bearded officer asked that his name not be
used.
   But there was a tinge of emotion at Zia's gravesite on the
grassy lawn in front of the mosque.
   ``I am digging this grave with my heart,'' 23-year-old Abdul
Khalek said as he leaned on his shovel to rest for a few minutes.

<HEAD>Burglars Return to Scene of the Tape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police investigating a break-in at Kennedy
International Airport watched a videotape of the crime _ and then
did a double take when the screen returned to live action and
showed the burglars had returned.
   The detectives captured one suspect but three others got away.
They captured a second man at LaGuardia Airport as he tried to
board a plane to Miami, Port Authority Police Capt. Frank Fox said
Friday.
   Both men were charged with burglary and possession of stolen
property.
   The caper, as outlined by Fox and Lynn Tierney of the Port
Authority's information office, went this way:
   Two men entered the Ogden-Allied Aviation Services warehouse at
Kennedy Airport on Wednesday night and removed $20,000 worth of
duty-free cigarettes, liquor and costume jewelry belonging to Air
Egypt.
   The theft, in a room monitored by a TV camera, was quickly
discovered and Port Authority police were notified. Shortly after
midnight, Ogden-Allied's manager, Richard Maumann, ran the
videotape for detectives Ray Nafey, John Trotter and Charles
Yeungst.
   When the replay ended, the live scene returned to the screen,
showing the burglars, this time with friends.
   ``After they took the stuff, the two guys went to Brooklyn to
get help and came back with two more guys and another car to clean
out the place. They were greedy,'' said Fox.

<DATELINE>CARMEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dirty Harry's restaurant was a little too
dirty, according to health inspectors who closed the kitchen at
Clint Eastwood's Hog's Breath Inn.
   Monterey County environmental health director Walter Wong said
his inspectors found violations ``too numerous to list'' when they
visited the restaurant Thursday.
   The bar remains open.
   Inspectors found inadequate refrigeration, unsanitary
conditions, improper food storage, structural problems that made it
difficult to clean the restaurant and an ``extremely dirty''
kitchen, Wong said.
   ``The dangerous part was the refrigeration was not working,'' he
said. ``Food is supposed to be kept at 40 degrees. This was at 68
degrees.''
   The restaurant's manager was in a meeting and was not available
for comment on Friday, and Eastwood, who is part owner, also was
not available, according to a woman who answered the phone at the
restaurant.
   Eastwood, best known as the tough-talking ``Dirty Harry'' of the
silver screen, was as mayor of this chic hamlet-by-the-sea until
April.
   Wong said the restaurant has been cited before, but corrected
the problems ``enough to get by on.''
   `I really couldn't justify letting them remain open when I felt
there wa a potential for people getting sick,'' said Updike. ``I
think they pretty much agreed with us.''

   President Reagan has agreed to meet
in Washington with American Indian leaders who object to remarks he
made about Indians during his summit meeting in Moscow, the White
House and an American Indian group said today.
   The American Indian Action Group, which had announced plans for
a protest march on President Reagan's ranch on Saturday, said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater contacted group members Thursday
afternoon and indicated the president would ``make good on his
offer to meet with American Indian people.''
   ``The White House staff has been directed to meet with the
American Indian Action Group to determine a date and time for the
meeting to occur in Washington, D.C.,'' the group's statement said.
   Bob Hall, a deputy White House press secretary, confirmed that
Fitzwater did tell the group that the president would meet with its
leaders. Hall said a staff meeting to make arrangements would be
held, probably during the president's ranch vacation, which ends
Sept. 6.
   The Indian group said it had ``made a commitment'' to Saturday's
demonstration and would proceed with the march to the ranch despite
the assurance from Fitzwater
   During the Moscow summit in May, the president told Soviet
university students, ``Maybe we made a mistake in trying to
maintain Indian cultures. Maybe we should not have humored them in
wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we
should have said, `No, come join us. Be citizens along with the
rest of us.''

   A forest and grass fire that killed cattle
and destroyed 10 houses grew by 7,000 acres overnight in the
mountains southeast of Helena, despite the efforts of 1,700
firefighters.
   ``It sounded like a train,'' said Barbara Duffy, whose cabin and
30 cows were destroyed by flames when the Warm Springs Creek fire
quadrupled in size Thursday. ``When we came out of the garage, we
saw this fireball coming at us through the trees.''
   Elsewhere, helicopters today ferried firefighters into a Wyoming
wilderness area near Yellowstone National Park to fight an 800-acre
blaze, and a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in
Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed today, killing one and
injuring three others. Firefighters also battled fires in
California, Idaho, Utah and other Western states.
   The Warm Springs Creek fire, in the Elkhorn Mountains, grew to
27,000 acres during the night, but on two fronts it took turns that
could help suppress it, said fire information officer Bob Krepps
said today.
   Westerly wind blowing at about 20 mph late Thursday ``pushed the
fire back into itself'' on its western perimeter, depriving it of
new fuel and relieving a threat to the 500 or so residents of the
Saddle Mountain subdivision about 10 miles southeast of Helena,
Krepps said. They had been warned that they might have to evacuate.
   On the fire's eastern edge, the flames moved out of the forested
high country and onto grassland. ``That's a real benefit to us
also,'' Krepps said, because of the lighter fuel.
   Although the flames advanced east to within about three miles of
the tiny community of Winston, about 15 miles southeast of Helena,
``There's good fire line in over there,'' Krepps said. ``I think
they're in pretty good shape this morning.''
   At least 40 people remained out of their homes while volunteer
fire crews helped cut fire lines around houses and other structures
west of Winston and near Montana City, a small town a few miles
south of Helena, authorities said.
   Fire officials said they were optimistic about a cooling trend
predicted for the weekend.
   Krepps said four homes and six summer cabins were burned early
Thursday when the fast-moving Warm Springs Creek took an unexpected
turn toward the north.
   Before the fire ballooned Wednesday night, about 1,700
firefighters had it 95 percent contained. The blaze began Aug. 9
when a four-wheel-drive vehicle caught fire. Eighty percent of the
fire has burned on the Helena National Forest.
   Hundreds of miles away in southeastern Montana, about 1,000
firefighters hoped to tighten the noose today around fires that
have burned 13,600 acres of timber and grassland near Lame Deer.
   Most of the three fires surrounding Lame Deer, a town of about
600 people on the North Cheyenne Indian Reservation, were contained
by fire lines Thursday night, said fire information officer Ron
Smith.
   In north-central Montana, nearly 950 firefighters were battling
a 4,800-acre fire on the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation. Containment
was predicted by Saturday night.
   In northwest Wyoming, Yellowstone officials closed the Norris
Campground on Thursday as a precaution due to a 69,000-acre fire
five miles to the south.
   The fire also forced the closure again Thursday of a 14-mile
road as trees scorched by the blaze toppled onto the pavement.
Another park campground remained closed because of a nearby blaze,
while a third was shut to provide a campground for firefighters.
   About 272,000 acres of the nation's oldest park have been
damaged by flames in recent weeks.
   In nearby Teton Wilderness today, 200 firefighters ferried by
helicopter battled an 800-acre wildfire, using pumps and hoses to
suck water from streams and ponds to spray on the flames.
   Meanwhile, in north-central Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest,
officials ordered the evacuation for a second time of the Apache
Oil Co.'s Paradise Ranch as a 3,000-acre fire, pushed by high
winds, jumped fire lines and threatened from a half-mile away.
   Firefighters in southwest Utah contained an 580-acre brush fire,
believed to be man-caused, that burned about 20 miles northwest of
St. George. Firefighters also controlled a 600-acre blaze in
northern Utah.
   In southern California's San Jacinto Mountains, crews worked to
contain an arson-caused wildfire that consumed 1,000 acres of brush blaze,
about 95 miles east of Los Angeles, was
about 40 percen
and timber. Thet contained Thursday.
   Firefighters in Idaho's Challis National Forest, meanwhile,
squelched a nearly 14,000-acre fire and were being sent elsewhere.

   Children of migrant farmworkers, who
often lag behind schoolmates because of continual uprooting, were
given the satisfaction of seeing one class project through this
summer: training to be astronauts.
   Eighty children from grades five through seven spent six weeks
on an imaginary space shuttle mission at Greenfield Community
College, using an elaborate imitation spaceship with a cockpit,
experiment station, bunks, galley and ``hygiene room,'' all hooked
up by computer to a ground control center.
   ``These students had a goal, for the first time in some of their
lives,'' said Martha Kelliher, who teaches fifth-graders in the
Massachusetts Migrant Education Program.
   ``When I first explained it, they were awed. A lot of them had
never worked with a computer. Some can't speak English. There was a
lot of hesitation and doubt in their eyes,'' she said Friday.
   By the time the program ended this week, however, the children
had learned enough astronaut lingo and computer tricks to take the
imitation spaceship on four-hour flights, conduct studies on acid
rain from outer space, radio an emergency message to mission
control that their teacher needed her lunch and finish the job they
had started.
   The space shuttle simulator was built nearly 10 years ago by
students at the two-year state college to teach appreciation for
living with limited food, water and trash disposal and give
students a better understanding of their role as global citizens,
said Greg Vouros, who runs the orbiter program at Greenfield.
   Vouros was looking for young would-be astronauts to train under
a grant from the state Department of Education when he met with
David Almeida, who runs the migrant education program in western
Massachusetts.
   Almeida said the program's aim is to give remedial help to
youngsters after school and during summers school so they don't
fall so far behind that dropping out of school and working as
non-skilled laborers are their only options.
   Many of the children are plunked into one school system after
another as their parents follow harvests up and down the East
Coast. The children may change textbooks and friends several times
a year, Almeida said.
   The space shuttle project, he said, showed them the importance
of goals and teamwork, math and English, and opened vistas of
opportunity.
   ``They realized, `If I can't read, I can't follow the
instructions on the screen and we may crash,''' Ms. Kelliher said.
``They also learned that if one person didn't know his job, the
whole success and life of the team was at stake.''
   Julio Correa, an 11-year-old mission commander whose father
works in Connecticut tobacco fields, said he learned ``respect for
the nature and for other people and being a part of a team. It was
kind of fun.''
   Ms. Kelliher said her class had prepared for the flight by
borrowing library books on space, listening to a nurse explain how
to take temperatures, blood pressure and pulse rates, and inventing
tools they might need on a flight.
   Vouros said children aged 9 through 13 are ideal for the
simulator flights.
   ``They are sophisticated enough to handle them and willing to
lose themselves in the dramatic play,'' he said. ``When you get to
the ninth grade, you're too cool to play the role in an uninhibited
fashion.''
   Even though some children spoke little English, other children
would translate. ``I never noticed that we had any problem in
communication,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Seek Ways To Combat Isolation of Rural America</HEAD>

   The bus that stops in Rushville five days a
week is a lifeline for 72-year-old Evelyn Trenkle.
   But she and the other 1,200 residents in the northwestern
Nebraska town face losing their bus service and joining the ranks
of thousands of rural Americans who live beyond the scope of
scheduled bus, rail and air service.
   ``We're just so isolated out here, I don't know what we'd
without it,'' said Mrs. Trenkle.
   Rushville, near the South Dakota border, is 400 miles from Omaha
and 30 miles from Chadron, the nearest community of any substance.
   Arrow-Black Hills Stage Lines runs the bus that stops in
Rushville. Two years ago, the company announced it would
discontinue the route, from Rapid City, S.D., to Omaha, because of
low ridership, said Jim Maly, schedule manager.
   The bus is still running because towns along the route joined
with the state and federal governments to work out a subsidy, but
the bus could be threatened again when the subsidy runs out, Maly
said.
   The isolation of rural America concerns not only residents, but
also the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   ``Too often, if you live in a rural community, the bus may no
longer come to town, nor may rail or air service be available,''
said Martin Fitzpatrick Jr., administrator of the Agriculture
Department's Office of Transportation.
   ``Many rural communities are now truly at the end of the line,
with limited access to any form of public transportation,''
Fitzpatrick said.
   His office, along with the U.S. Department of Transportation's
Urban Mass Transportation Administration and the United Bus Owners
of America, have spent a year studying rural transportation
problems.
   That work will culminate with a three-day conference beginning
Monday in Omaha to develop a plan to ``reconnect rural America.''
Among those scheduled to speak are Gov. Kay Orr, Sen. Larry
Pressler of South Dakota, and Rep. Virginia Smith of Nebraska.
   ``During the last year, a new effort has begun to reconnect
rural America. We hope this national meeting will consolidate those
efforts for the future,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   ``We've learned that while service to rural communities indeed
has been lost in many cases, there are a variety of ways rural
transportation needs can be met,'' he said.
   ``For example, flexible point-to-point routes tailored to
particular passenger needs are beginning to take the place of
traditional, fixed-route systems. Also, rural passenger needs
sometimes can be dovetailed with the shipment of goods in sparsely
populated areas.''
   Steve Sprague, the United Bus Owners' vice president for
government affairs, said the conference should provide a blueprint
for both governmental agencies and transportation providers.
   ``We want to try to pick and choose the most appropriate way
communities and states can begin to build that intercity
transportation service,'' Sprague said. ``When we walk away from
Omaha we will know, hopefully, what are the best patterns to
pursue.''
   While Sprague concedes that many see the 1,600 bus owners and
operators represented by his group as part of the problem, he says
the association's participation in the yearlong study proves the
group wants to be part of a solution.
   Federal, local or state subsidies for private carriers serving
rural America can help solve the problem, he said.
   ``There is a middle ground somewhere between full public and
fully private transportation that has not been identified for rural
communities,'' he said.
   But even with boosts like the subsidy provided to the Rushville
bus route, service is far from guaranteed there. The $200,000
subsidy is a fixed sum, and Arrow-Black Hills will have to
re-evaluate continuing the service when the money runs out, Maly
said.
   While many stranded by the loss of bus service stay home when
they're lonely or ill, Mrs. Trenkle says she would move to a town
with bus or rail service.
   ``I don't believe I would stay here; I just couldn't,'' she
said. ``I wouldn't be able to get anywhere. There are a lot of
people like me who are elderly and can't drive too far who need the
bus service.''

<TEXT>
   The government put more police in
the streets Friday on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the
Soviet-led invasion that crushed Alexander Dubcek's liberal
``Prague spring'' of 1968.
   Official media concentrated on criticizing the former Communist
Party chief and other sponsors of reforms that resembled those now
pursued by Mikhail S. Gorbachev but did not please the Kremlin of
the time.
   Police ranks also were reinforced in the Slovak capital of
Bratislava, where Dubcek lives. The disgraced former leader, now
67, said he would spend the anniversary quietly with his
grandchildren.
   Dubcek refused an interview earlier this week when asked by
Western reporters. ``They will be angry with me,'' he said of the
authorities who gave him a minor forestry job in Bratislava in 1970
and have kept him under close watch.
   Whatever the police presence, Czechoslovakia's dissident
movement was at work.
   Leaflets stuffed in some city mailboxes urged citizens to gather
in Wenceslas Square, scene of protests 1968, on Saturday night for
a discussion of the invasion.
   Spokesmen for Charter 77, the human rights group, planned to
deliver a statement to the Soviet Embassy at noon Saturday
demanding a full account of the invasion from the Kremlin. They
also planned to lay flowers at the embassy in memory of
Czechoslovaks killed in the invasion and ensuing street violence.
   Most of the 15.5 million Czechoslovaks fell silent after the
invasion of Aug. 20-21, 1968, and few are expected to show their
feelings openly this weekend about the events of a generation ago.
   ``This anniversary is not being celebrated,'' government
spokesman Miroslav Pavel said. ``We see no reasons to celebrate.''
   Authorities expelled about 20 West Europeans, most of them
Italians, who hung a banner across Wenceslas Square on Thursday
demanding freedom in Czechoslovakia and withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   On Thursday and Friday, state television broadcast a 90-minute
film showing Dubcek and other former leaders expelled from the
party with him in a purge of half a million members overseen by
Milos Jakes, the current party chief.
   It reflected the line taken by state-run media in recent weeks:
that changes were needed in 1968, but Dubcek and his allies were
weak leaders who permitted events get out of control.
   Several academics and district party leaders were shown
recalling the events of 1968 and blaming Dubcek and other leaders,
who enjoyed enormous popularity, for precipitating the invasion.
   ``We hoped that a process of democratization would take place
that would open room for positive changes,'' writer Miroslav Hlatky
said.
   ``Most people lived in the euphoria of those days and expected
just a socialist (communist) system. But all of a sudden the
process of democratization was strangled (by anti-communist forces)
and the human face of socialism they were wearing changed into a
hard and evil mask.''
   Hlatky's allusion was to Dubcek's stated wish to create
``socialism with a human face.''
   Gorbachev's adoption of the phrase and his own zeal for reform
have prompted speculation Moscow would change its stance on the
invasion, whose official reason was to stop a counterrevolution
that might take Czechoslovakia out of the Warsaw Pact.
   Although Soviet historians have made clear there is more
official sympathy for Dubcek than before, Kremlin spokesman Gennady
I. Gerasimov reiterated this week that the Soviet party
``respects'' the official Czechoslovak judgment that the invasion
was necessary.
   On Friday, the Soviet news agency Tass said the Soviet Union's
intervention saved the country from irresponsible leadership and
possible brutual repression of communists.
   ``Anti-socialist forces, taking advantage of political
irresponsibilty and opportunism of a part of the leadership of the
Communist Party of Czechoslovakia of that time, made an attempt ...
to tear Czechoslovakia away from the socialist community,'' the
Tass commentary said. ``The friends and allies of socialist
Czechoslovakia could not remain indifferent.''
   Czechoslovak media repeated that official view for the past
month but Milan Matous, a party theorist well-known for justifying
the invasion, conceded in two articles that a ``deeper and more
critical'' evaluation might be made.
   Pavel, the government spokesman, indicated to reporters Thursday
a commission of Soviet and Czechoslovak historians might be formed.
In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, however, he said
that was ``just a private idea. It is not under discussion.''
   Cautious economic reforms have been made since Jakes assumed the
leadership last December, but political change seems distant.

   West Lanes Bowling Center gave Rick L.
Gibbons a check for $100 when he rolled a perfect game last
September. But now Gibbons is suing West Lanes _ because of the way
it takes care of its lanes.
   Gibbons, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, filed suit Thursday in Douglas
County District Court alleging that a maintenance mistake kept him
from receiving certification of a perfect score from the American
Bowling Congress.
   The bowling center's owner said he's befuddled by the lawsuit,
which seeks unspecified damages and court costs.
   ``I just think it's wild,'' said co-owner Bud Simmonds. ``I
really didn't think he'd go so far as to file a suit.''
   Gibbons bowled a perfect score of 300 during league play on
Sept. 8, then applied for recognition by the American Bowling
Congress. But his application was denied after a certified
inspector from the Omaha Mens Bowling Association found that West
Lanes had ``dressed'' its lanes in violation of national
regulations, the lawsuit says.
   Dressing is the daily application of mineral oil to bowling
lanes, which can affect the path a ball takes down the lane.
   West Lanes used the short-distance dressing method in which oil
is applied along the first 24 feet of the 60-foot lane.
   But the inspector found that oil had been applied on too much of
the lane.
   ``Somehow the machine that hae Massine and then with Marie
Rambert, who encouraged him to try choreography and helped him win
his first commission, a small ballet called ``A Tragedy of
Fashion'' created for a revue in 1926.
   In retirement, Ashton continued to remain active as a consultant
and visitor to both The Royal Ballet and its touring sister
company, the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet.
   ``He never really stopped,'' said Mary Clarke, editor of the
monthly The Dancing Times. ``He could always come up with a pas de
deux or a party piece for a special occasion. He was adored by
everyone.''
   Asked once what was the inspiration for his inventions, Ashton
replied, ``I don't know, that's fairly difficult to say. I am
fairly religious. I rather put myself in the hands of a superior
power ... I am almost like a wireless (radio).''
   Ashton was unmarried and the Royal Ballet said it did not know
if there were any survivors. No funeral arrangements were announced.

<TEXT>
   New York City's schools chancellor is telling
schools to consider getting rid of time clocks that many teachers
cite as hated symbols of their lack of professional status.
   Chancellor Richard Green has drafted a memorandum directing the
principals and staffs of each of the city's 974 public schools to
submit plans by Dec. 1 for keeping track of teachers' hours without
time clocks, he said in an interview Thursday.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the
United Federation of Teachers, the union representing the city's
61,000 teachers.
   ``I have called around the country. I don't know of any other
school district that has them,'' said Feldman.
   New York City teachers have been punching clocks since the early
1900s, when reformers thought schools should operate on a factory
model for the sake of efficiency, she said.
   The city's teachers are required to be in school at least six
hours, 20 minutes, the length of a school day.
   Green's predecessor, former chancellor Nathan Quinones, had sent
out two more weakly worded memorandums at the union's urging to
persuade schools to end time clocks.
   But more than 800 city schools still have them, according to
Feldman.
   ``We've had teachers docked for being a minute late. And the
time teachers spend after school doesn't count,'' she said.
   Green's directive differs from earlier ones in imposing a
definite deadline. It also orders principals to collaborate with
teachers.
   Green said he was ``asking principals to work with their staffs
to determine how they can account for attendance in the absence of
time clocks, or whether they want to sustain them. They will make
the decision building by building, and no one will ever be able to
say they didn't have a chance to participate in a work-related
issue that I think is symbolic.''
   Alternatives to time clocks include sign-out sheets and time
cards.

<HEAD>Pentagon Acknowledges Vincennes Crew Made Several Mistakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon today acknowledged that the crew
of the USS Vincennes made several mistakes in shooting down an
Iranian airliner but concluded that the ship's captain, based on
what he had been told, ``did what his nation expected of him. ...''
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe,
said that an investigation of the July 3 tragedy found that Capt.
Will C. Rogers III and his crew were acting under severe stress as
the airliner approached them during a surface engagement with
Iranian gunboats.
   The Vincennes mistook Iran Air flight 655 for an F-14 fighter
and shot it down, killing 290 people.
   ``The commanding officer never received te clear evidence that
he thought he needed to establish that the Iranian aircraft had not
come to participate in the ongoing surface action,'' Crowe told a
news conference.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told reporters he had
decided to withdraw a letter of censure proposed for Lt. Cmdr.
Scott Lustig, the operations officer, who was faulted for not
adequately verifying information he was passing to the captain.
   Carlucci said that President Reagan had received the report and
concurred in its findings. Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater,
who was with the vacationing president in California, said in a
statement that ``this tragic accident was ultimately the result of
the conflict between Iran and Iraq which we now hope is on the
verge of settlement.''
   Crowe cited these mistakes:
   _A conclusion that the civilian Airbus was descending rather
than ascending as it approached the Vincennes.
   _A report that the jetliner was transmitting a signal
identifying it as a military aircraft.
   _A report that the plane was outside a commercial air corridor
crossing the Persian Gulf.
   Crowe said that, taken individually, the mistakes ``were not
crucial to the ... decision'' to fire two Standard missiles at the
Airbus.
   ``Even cumulatively, they do not change the picture in a
decisive way,'' said Crowe.
   ``Our past experience in the gulf, the intelligence available to
the ship, and the rules of engagement all supported such a
judgment'' by the ship's captain, Crowe said.
   ``I believe that given the operating environment, Capt. Rogers
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in defense
of his ship and crew,'' Crowe said.
   ``The main recommendation of the investigation was that no
disciplinary action should be taken against any U.S. naval
personnel associated with this incident,'' said Crowe.
   Despite some shifts, the findings of the final report were
largely consistent with the Pentagon statements on July 3 in
emphasizing the stressful combat environment in which Rogers and
his crew operated.
   The report offered a wealth of new detail: the officers in the
command and control center could hear gunfire from the surface
battle outside, including the noise of bullets pinging off the
metal hull; the ship was heeling at a 32-degree angle as the
airliner approached, making it difficult for the men to stand,
causing objects to fall off flat surfaces and lights to flicker.
   ``I dare say that it would be hard to even have this press
conference under those conditions, much less reach critical
decisions on a number of targets during a very short time-frame,''
said Carlucci.
   In all, Crowe said, Rogers faced a series of problems ``he could
not control or discount'' in the seven minutes between the plane's
departure from an Iranian field and the destruction of the Airbus.
   Crowe laid much of the blame for the tragedy on Iran.
   ``An examination of the events on 3 July leads quickly to the
conclusion that Iran must share responsibility for the tragedy, and
the investigation so found,'' he said.
   ``By any measure, it was unconscionable to ignore the repeated
warnings of the United States and permit an airliner to take off
from a joint military-civilian airfield and fly directly into the
midst of a surface action in the Strait of Hormuz which the
Iranians themselves had initiated,'' he said.
   The report exonerated the sophisticated Aegis radar and tracking
system aboard the Vincennes, one of the Navy's much lauded
Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruisers.
   Carlucci said a number of changes have been proposed as a result
of the investigation, including modifying video displays to display
an approaching object's distance and altitude, revising the process
by which an object is designated as a fighter aircraft and
subjecting the operators of the Aegis system to psychological
testing to ensure they are ready for combat.
   Much of the controversy surrounding the tragedy has centered on
discrepancies between Pentagon statements on the day of the
incident and bits of information that surfaced as Rear Adm. William
Fogarty conducted his investigation.
   ``Our earlier Washington briefings on the accident were based on
information received from the ship shortly after the action, some
of which were found by the investigation to be incorrect,'' Crowe
said.
   ``Adm. Fogarty's investigation also revealed that mistakes were
made on board Vincennes that day. That in itself is not surprising
to anyone who understands the stress of hostile action in a life or
death situation,'' said Crowe.
   One mistake involved transmissions by a device aboard the
airliner known as the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)
transponder, which Pentagon officials earlier said sent signals in
what is known as Mode 3, used by military and civilian aircraft, as
well as in Mode 2, reserved for warplanes.
   ``The IFF emission from flight 655 was Mode 3, which a
commercial aircraft normally uses. The Vincennes also detected a
contradictory Mode 2 military squawk and mistakenly concluded that
it came from flight 655. That detection did lead the (Vincennes'
officers) ... to declare the contact an F-14. Much as been made of
that error,'' said Crowe.
   But, he added, ``it was not a crucial element in Capt. Rogers'
decision to fire. Military aircraft in an attack run can disguise
their identify using civilian IFF signals or on ocassion, no IFF
signal at all.''
   ``Significantly, Iranian F-4s operating against U.S. units on 18
April were squawking only Mode 3, the civilian code,'' he said.
   Crowe also noted that ``questions have been raised about the
ship's initial report that the aircraft was outside the air
corridor. The report was wrong.''
   But Crowe said that ``whether or not an aircraft is in a
commercial air corridor is a peripheral point to a commanding
officer engaged in a hostile action, particularly when the corridor
covers the engagement area. The Persian Gulf is blanketed by
commerical air routes. They cover over 50 percent of the gulf.''
   Rogers told investigators that he concentrated on the position
of the airliner ``three-to-four miles off the median'' and
``interpreted that as unusual,'' said Crowe.
   ``Perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call of
flight 655 as descending instead of climbing,'' said Crowe.
   That, too, was wrong, said Crowe, ``but it is impossible to
say'' how it affected Rogers' decision because he received his last
altitude reading after he had already received permission to fire,
and 20 to 30 seconds before he actually did so.

<HEAD>Reagan Plans White House Meeting With American Indian Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is planning a
White House meeting with American Indian leaders who protested his
remark at the Moscow summit that the United States perhaps ``should
not have humored'' the Indians, the White House said Friday.
   The American Indian Action Group said presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater indicated Thursday that Reagan would ``make good
on his offer to meet with American Indian people.''
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Bob Hall confirmed Friday
that Fitzwater told the group that the president's staff had been
told to meet with the Indians to determine a date and time for the
meeting.
   The Indian group, which had previously announced plans to rally
and walk to Reagan's mountaintop ranch north of here Saturday, said
in a statement it had ``made a commitment'' to the demonstration
and would proceed with it.
   Hall said the staff-level meeting probably would be held in
Santa Barbara while Reagan is vacationing at the ranch. The meeting
in Washington will take place some time after Reagan returns to the
White House on Sept. 6, he said.
   On May 31, during his Moscow summit talks with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Reagan told Moscow University students,
``Maybe we made a mistake in trying to maintain Indian cultures.
Maybe we should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that
kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, `No, come
join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us'.''
   Congress granted American Indians full citizenship in 1924. It
was not until 1948 that a court decision gave them full voting
rights in Arizona and New Mexico in local and state elections.
   Reagan's remarks outraged Indian leaders. The president invited
them to meet with him ``at any time,'' but the American Indian
Action Group said he failed to respond to letters and telephone
calls from Indian leaders.
   ``During his administration, Reagan has never met with Indian
leaders,'' the group said. ``The remarks he made in Moscow were his
first reference to American Indians in eight years.''
   The group said about 200 Indians were expected to gather at
Refugio State Beach on Saturday and walk to the ranch.
   The White House described weather at the ranch as sunny and warm
and said the president was continuing with his usual routine of
paperwork, wood chopping and horseback riding.
   He plans to travel to Los Angeles on Tuesday for a five-day
stay, stopping en route at the Marine Operations Building of the
Port of Long Beach to sign legislation intended to reduce U.S.
trade deficits.
   He also plans to attend a fund-raising lunch in Irvine, Calif.,
for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's re-election campaign.

   New York legally prohibited a child prodigy who
graduated from a Florida law school at age 16 from taking the bar
exam and practicing law in the state until he is 21, a federal
judge has ruled.
   However, in the case brought by Stephen A. Baccus, now a
19-year-old lawyer in Miami, U.S. District Judge Gerard L. Goettel
declared unconstitutional a state provision requiring an aspiring
attorney to be 18 before entering law school.
   ``Simply put, we think the prospective Mozarts of the legal
profession deserve better,'' the judge wrote in a ruling made
public Friday. Mozart was composing music by age 5.
   While their entrance to the legal profession may be legitimately
delayed by an age requirement, prodigies should not be punished
``because they, by virtue of their precociousness, were able to
pursue those rigors at an early age,'' Goettel wrote.
   Baccus said by telephone from Miami that he was pleased with the
ruling affirming his education but disappointed that the provision
keeping him from taking the bar exam was upheld. ``I've already
been practicing law for two years, so why are they keeping me from
joining the bar?''
   Baccus said he and his 26-year-old law partner still planned to
open an office in New York to specialize in computer and
entertainment law as soon as they could afford it.
   He said he had not decided if he would appeal the decision but
would seek an exemption that would allow him to take the state bar
exam in February.
   In 1983, when he was 14, Baccus earned a bachelor's degree in
computer science and mathematics from the University of Miami. The
following September he entered the university's law school,
graduated in 1986 and was admitted to the Florida bar.
   During the year, he established residency in New York and in
January 1987 applied to take the state bar exam. But because he
wasn't 21 and had entered law school before age 18, his application
was rejected. The court papers said he appeared otherwise qualified.

   Michael Dukakis took his promise of
economic opportunity to rural Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas on
Friday, and said George Bush and Republicans were ignoring ominous
trade and budget deficits ``because they don't know how to deal
with it.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, also took another
indirect shot at Bush and his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle, who is embroiled in a controversy over using family
influence to get into the National Guard at the height of the
Vietman war.
   ``The test of strong presidential leadership is strength, the
quality of the people you select to serve with you,'' Dukakis told
an early afternoon rally at the train depot in Bismarck. The crowd
appeared to outnumber the town's population of 1,600 people.
   In Belleville, Ill., at the start of his day, Dukakis recalled
Harry Truman's love of whistle-stop campaigning and then boarded a
train of his own _ ``The Duke Express'' _ to travel the day after
Bush accepted the Republican presidential nomination.
   ``Today we are going to begin a journey into the future,''
Dukakis said. ``While the vice president and the Republicans took a
trip down memory lane last night, we're looking to the future.''
   The Democratic nominee said Bush's convention address ``wasn't a
bad speech actually.'' But he attacked the vice president for
failing to say how he would deal with the red ink on the budget and
trade ledgers.
   ``He talked a lot about missions but I must have missed a
page,'' said Dukakis, who did not watch Bush's speech but reviewed
its text. ``There was nothing in there about the two biggest
economic challenges we face in this country,'' he said.
   ``We didn't hear a word from the Republicans on the budget
deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week. And we know
why. They don't know how to deal with it. They don't know what to
do with it. That's why we're going to have a Democratic president
and vice president.''
   The Massachusetts governor, at his rallies here and in
Belleville, mentioned his state's unemployment rate has been about
3 percent for several years while the jobless rates in the Illinois
and Missouri towns hover near 10 percent. Dukakis blamed Reagan
administration policies he said fueled prosperity in some regions
but ingored and exacerbated economic distress in others.
   ``They may be satisfied, but we aren't,'' Dukakis said. ``We can
do a lot better ... This January, we Americans are going to take
charge of our economic future.''
   At both rallies he mentioned the deficits, a lack of affordable
housing, the Pentagon procurement scandal, and the stewardship of
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, saying Republicans ducked
those issues at their convention.
   Dukakis led the crowds in the refrain ``not a single word from
the Republicans'' after mentioning each of those issues.
   Dukakis boarded his 11-car Amtrak train in Belleville and headed
across the Missouri river, through St. Louis and down the
Mississippi River to Bismarck, a mining town where he visited a
depot-area diner and was joined by a former rival, Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt. Then it was all aboard for Poplar Bluff in
southeastern Missouri and Walnut Ridge in the farmlands of
northeast Arkansas. The total distance of the trip was 239 miles.
From there Dukakis was flying to Texas to campaign Saturday with
his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   The controversy over Bush's selection of the 41-year-old Quayle
as the GOP vice presidential nominee and Quayle's use of family
influece to get into the guard has prompted a revision of Dukakis'
stump speech.
   He has not criticized Quayle directly but for the past three
days has delivered a variation of this line at virtually every
campaign stop: ``Nobody has ever questioned the qualifications of
Lloyd Bentsento be vice president or the president.''
   Dukakis drew laughs from reporters in Bismarck when he joked
about criticism from Republicans that Dukakis and his wife, Kitty,
show too much public affection.
   ``It's true that Democrats sleep in double beds and Republicans
prefer twins,'' he said. ``That's why there are more Democrats.''

<HEAD>Leaders Will Defy Israeli Efforts to Destroy Local Committees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIT SAHUR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of local committee
said Friday they will defy Israeli attempts to stamp out the
informal system of self-rule that has sprung up during the
8-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared the ``popular
committees'' illegal on Thursday and threatened to deport prominent
activists.
   On Friday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said: ``These
committees incited disturbances and brought a lot of suffering upon
the (Arab) population. We had to stop their activities.''
   Palestinian intellectuals said the grass-roots organization is
far too extensive to be broken.
   ``It's a way of life now,'' said Saeb Erakat, a professor at An
Najah University in Nablus, which has been closed. ``I don't think
Rabin with all the military might at his disposal can do anything
about it except cause more suffering.''
   Hundreds of committees have been formed in villages and towns of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and on almost every city
block.
   Organizing began last spring in response to leaflets issued by
the clandestine United National Leadership of the Uprising, which
is linked to Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In the mainly Christian town of Beit Sahur, organizers said
groups of 40 to 70 families sent one representative each to
neighborhood centers. About 12,000 Palestinians live in the town
near Shepherd's Field, where the Bible says the first word of
Christ's birth was announced.
   Neighborhood representatives elected committees of seven or
eight members, but Israeli authorities arrested eight prominent
Palestinians who tried to form an independent town council.
   ``The local committees provide an alternative authority to
occupation, and their ultimate aim is to cut ties between the
people and Israel's military government,'' said a 50-year-old
teacher who has been jailed several times for political activism.
He demanded anonymity to avoid arrest.
   Support for local committees appears strong in Beit Sahur. It is
fed by anger at Israeli soldiers, who are blamed for the death of a
17-year-old boy killed by a falling rock and the arrests of 120
residents.
   Townspeople turned in their identity cards in protest after
soldiers broke into living rooms to confiscate television sets and
took cars from driveways in raids against delinquent taxpayers.
   Strikes and refusing to pay taxes are two of the main
non-violent ways to join the rebellion, in which at least 248
Palestinians have been killed since Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have
been slain.
   Soldiers shot and wounded at least two Palestinians in the West
Bank on Friday.
   A commercial strike was only partially successful Friday in the
West Bank and was ignored in the Gaza Strip. The army delayed the
opening of West Bank schools and universities, which it considers
rallying points for violence, until at least Oct. 1.
   Committees in Beit Sahur, following a pattern in the occupied
lands, has mobilized Palestinians for such non-violent activities
as:
   _ Planting gardens to reduce dependence on Israeli markets and
to raise money for other activities.
   _ Organizing underground schools after Israel closed five
universities and 1,500 elementary and secondary schools.
   _ Giving money and food to families who have quit jobs in Israel
or whose breadwinners are in jail.
   _ Guarding neighborhoods from thieves after activists forced
Palestinian policemen to quit their jobs.
   _ Providing medical care for injured protesters.
   A 45-year-old professional who heads a committee said the army
arrested volunteers who obeyed leaflets ordering a cleanup in the
absence of city garbage collection, which was suspended for lack of
tax revenues.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' he said. ``Is it political for me to want
to plant vegetables, teach my son or clean the street?''
   A Defense Ministry announcement said: ``Every person who
continues to be a member of popular committees and every person who
assists these committees will face arrest and trial.''
   Moshe Negbi of Israel's Civil Rights Association said that meant
anyone carrying a leaflet, attending a meeting, performing a
service or contributing money to a committee could be jailed for 10
years.
   Answers to Rabin appeared in graffiti near Beit Sahur's
now-inactive city hall: ``Increased violence will only increase our
resistance'' and ``Form more popular committees.''
   The committee leader said local groups would have to be a ``bit
more cautious,'' even go underground, but ``we are not going to
stop cooperating with each other. ... People don't fear the
soldiers any more. We got rid of our fear.''
   Other grass-roots groups called ``strike forces'' paint slogans
on walls and distribute leaflets telling residents when to strike
and when to open stores.
   Masked teen-agers threaten or punish people who pay Israeli
taxes or go to work during a strike.
   A Beit Sahur doctor's car was burned because he paid an Israeli
license fee so he could use it to visit patients. A community
leader said he disagreed with the arson but his committee was not
consulted.

<TEXT>
   A car exploded near an Israeli army jeep in
southern Lebanon on Friday, killing the auto's two occupants but
only slightly injuring the three Israeli soldiers in the jeep, a
military source said.
   The army was investigating whether the car was rigged with
explosives or hit a land mine in the incident, which occurred in
Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Israeli troops searched the area, about six miles north of the
Israeli-Lebanese border near the town of Marjayoun.
   The military source said the car, a Renault with Lebanese
license plates, exploded about 40 yards from the jeep.
   Three Israeli soldiers were injured slightly and treated at a
first aid station in the northern Israeli town of Qiryat Shemona,
the source said.
   Israel radio said the army was investigating whether the car was
rigged with explosives as part of a suicide mission or hit a road
mine.
   In Beirut, an anonymous caller told a Western news agency that
the driver of the Renault was on a ``heroic suicide operation''
aimed at an Israeli army convoy.
   The caller claimed responsibility on behalf of Islamic
Resistance, a group of Shiite Moslem extremists seeking to oust
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
   Israel established the security zone, a six- to 10-mile buffer
strip north of the border, when it withdrew the bulk of its troops
from Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   The zone, a target of frequent attacks by Shiite Moslem and
Palestinian guerrillas, is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops
and more than 1,000 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia.

   One of two prosecutors shot during a
robbery died Friday, soon after he was taken off life-support and
hours after a man found sleeping on a beach was charged in what
police said was a random crime.
   Assistant State Attorney Norman Langston, 27, had slipped into a
coma shortly after the Wednesday night shootings and died at
Medical Center Hospital, said Penny Walker, spokeswoman for the
20th Judicial District State Attorney's office.
   ``He was a real all-American guy. The people who knew him and
loved him say they never knew anyone who didn't like him. He loved
the beach, he was real athletic. He really loved being here,'' said
Ms. Walker.
   His colleague, prosecutor Kathleen Finnegan, 28, was in stable
condition at Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, where she
underwent surgery to remove bullets from her arms and shoulders.
   ``She does not know about Norman's condition. When she's stable
enough to be told,'' Ms. Walker said.
   Samuel Andrew Pettit, 26, was arrested on a Naples beach
Thursday night on a charge of unlawfully possessing a gun and was
later transferred to Punta Gorda, officials said.
   Pettit was charged with first-degree murder and attempted
first-degree murder, and also will be charged with two counts each
of kidnapping and armed robbery, the spokeswoman said.
   ``It's apparently a random robbery-kidnapping-shooting, if such
a thing can be random. There doesn't seem to appear there was any
knowledge of who he was taking,'' said Ms. Walker.
   The prosecutors were abducted at gunpoint outside a restaurant
and robbed, then were forced to to drive to an isolated location
where the gunman shot them repeatedly with a small-caliber handgun
before fleeing, said Charlotte County Sheriff's spokeswoman Tracey
Melneciuc.
   Ms. Finnegan was able to get to a tavern a mile and a half away
to call for help, Ms. Melneciuc said. Authorities have not said if
she drove or walked.
   Langston was hired as a prosecutor May 31, a year after
receiving his law degree from Nova University's Law School in Fort
Lauderdale, Ms. Walker said.
   Ms. Finnegan had worked for three years as an assistant public
defender before crossing the aisle to become a prosecutor last
January, Ms. Walker said.

<TEXT>
   John Evans, regarded as the world's oldest
man, celebrated his 111th birthday Friday with his rules for a long
life: don't smoke, drink or swear, but treat yourself to honey and
a song.
   The chipper Welshman, who lives with his 77-year-old son and his
wife, told the BBC that much of his good health comes from a good
diet with plenty of vegetables.
   ``But some part of it is taking hot water in the morning ...
(with) a small bit of honey. I've been doing that since I retired
and that's going on 38 years (ago),'' the former miner told BBC
radio in an interview at his home in FForest-Fach near Swansea in
South Wales.
   ``Honey is great,'' said Evans. ``I get plenty of that on my
birthday.''
   Singing helps, too.
   ``I've been doing that since I was a little boy. Going to Sunday
school, I'd sing, plenty of it,'' he said, breaking into a Welsh
song.
   But Evans, who visited London for the first time last year when
he turned 110 and had a pacemaker fitted when he was 108, vetoes
some things.
   ``I say this definitely: no drink and no smoking of any kind.
And no cursing and swearing which is disturbing (to) the nerves,''
he said.
   Evans, who was born in 1877, began working in the mines when he
was 13 and stopped work at the age of 73 only when he was forced to
retire by his company.
   He has a wheelchair but prefers a walking stick, and gardened
until he was 95, planting potatoes and other vegetables.
   Anna Nicholas, spokeswoman for The Guinness Book of Records,
said Evans is considered the oldest living man because he has a
birth certificate to prove his age.
   The oldest living person is Jeanne Calment, from Arles, France
who was born on Feb. 21, 1875, which makes her 113, Miss Nicholas
said. Guinness only learned of Ms. Calment last month, and she will
appear in its 1989 record book.
   Anna Eliza Williams of Swansea, listed in the 1988 book as the
world's oldest person, died in January at the age of 114.

   Sen. Dan Quayle said today he broke no
rules to get into the Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War
and would do the same thing again.
   At an outdoor news conference at his hometown, Quayle
acknowledged that a family friend who was an employee of his
grandfather's newspaper and a former commander of the Indiana
National Guard probably interceded on his behalf.
   The Indianapolis News had reported Thursday that its former
managing editor, Wendell C. Phillippi, had been asked about
entering the Guard by Quayle.
   ``Wendell Phillippi knew that I wanted to get into the National
Guard and I hope that he helped me and I think he did,'' Quayle
told reporters today. ``I would hope that he helped me and I expect
that.''
   Quayle said he initially called his parents to discuss his
desire to enter the National Guard when he was about to lose his
colleage student deferment.
   Asked why he did not just go down and fill out papers if his
entry into the Guard was as routine as he suggested it was, Quayle
said:
   ``I do what any normal person would do at that age. You call
home. You call home to mother and father and say `I'd like to get
in the National Guard.''
   He said he also talked briefly to Phillippi. ``I told him I
wanted to get into the National Guard. I would assume calls would
be made. I talked to Mr. Phillippi very briefly. I hope that he
helped me and I thihnk he did.''
   Quayle said he saw nothing wrong with what he did.
   ``I got into the National Guard fairly,'' he said. ``I did not
ask anyone to break the rules and so far as I know no one did.''
   Asked to assess the way he proceeded as a 22-year-old, he said,
``I would not have done anything differently'' if he had known he
would be running for vice president one day.
   Earlier today in New Orleans, Quayle had poked fun at the
controversy over his entry into the National Guard during the
Vietnam War by introducing himself to party leaders in mock
military fashion as if addressing a superior.
   Quayle, who appeared with George Bush at a Republican National
Committee meeting the morning after the GOP national convention
unamimously ratified him as the vice presidential nominee, said
jokingly that he had learned how to introduce himself on the
campaign trail.
   Then Quayle snapped to attention, and in loud, staccato-like
military diction, said: ``I stand at attention. Name: Dan Quayle.
Serial number 303 50 4096. Indiana National Guard. Six years and
proud of it.'' The audience applauded.
   Quayle proceeded to praise Bush, the presidential nominee,
before the two men headed out on the campaign trail, traveling
first to Indiana, Quayle's home state.
   The Indiana senator promised answers today to questions over
what influence his family used to secure his entry into the
National Guard. The issue tarnished Quayle selection as the No. 2
on the GOP ticket even before he was nominated Thursday night.
   Aides to Bush spent much of the day debating a response to the
furor and denying any thought of replacing Quayle on the ticket.
   ``There's nothing we feel Sen. Quayle misled us on,'' Bush
campaign official Rich Bond said today on NBC-TV.
   But critics were harsher.
   ``Let's face it, the question is whether a rich kid's family got
him into the Guard when other people were getting drafted,'' said
John DeCamp, a Vietnam veteran and Republican delegate from
Nebraska. ``Some of them like me got shot at a lot and a great many
of them just plain got shot and killed.''
   Rep. Bob Dornan of California, every bit a conservative, said,
``It requires a Checkers-like speech, and he must do _ must do it _
quickly, before this gets out of hand.''
   Dornan referred to a televised speech during the 1952 campaign
in which then-GOP vice presidential nominee Richard M. Nixon
successfully responded to allegations he had a slush fund while
serving in the Senate from California. The speech, in which he said
his family and dog, Checkers, were more important anything else,
kept Nixon on Dwight Eisenhower's ticket.
   ``I don't like the fact that Quayle denied yesterday that
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had,''
said Rep. Helen Bentley, chairman of the Bush campaign in Maryland.
``Quayle can do one of two things: admit this and that he was a
liar _ or he can withdraw from the race.''
   But later Thursday, she backed off her strong criticism, saying
the issue was ``dead'' and had been based on ``inaccurate news
reports.''
   Quayle drew many defenders as well. And at the end of the day,
it was certain he had the most important supporter of all.
   ``I'm proud to have Dan Quayle at my side,'' Bush told the
delegates.
   For his part, Quayle said the focus should be on Bush in the
convention hall and refused on Thursday to answer questions about
how he got into the Indiana National Guard.
   ``I'm going to continue to answer questions you raise about me,
about issues, about anything through this campaign,'' he said
entering the Superdome. ``Tonight is George Bush's night. And in
deference to George Bush, I'm not going to get into all the details.
   ``I'll be around ... to answer your questions,'' he added.
   During his acceptance speech inside the hall, the second-term
senator added a reference to show an unbending stand.
   ``As a young man, I served six years in the National Guard. And,
like the millions of Americans who have served in the Guard ... I
am proud of it,'' Quayle said.
   Questions were first raised about his military service on
Wednesday, when he and Bush faced reporters for the first time
together. Quayle called suggestions that his choice of the National
Guard was a method to avoid the draft _ and service in Vietnam _
``a cheap shot.''
   Later Wednesday, he said he was not aware of any efforts by his
family or friends to win him a spot in the Guard.
   He joined the National Guard in 1969, days after he was
graduated from college and thus lost his student deferment from the
draft. Quayle was a private first class in the Guard, serving as a
writer in a public information unit until 1975.
   During the height of the draft and the Vietnam War, waiting
lists were long to get into the Guard in many states, which
exempted young men from the draft and carried only a small chance
of being sent to the combat zone of Southeast Asia.
   Of the more than 58,000 American casualties in the Vietnam war,
97 were Guardsmen in mobilized units. about entering the Guard by
Quayle.
   Phillippi, who worked for Quayle's grandfather at the
Indianapolis newspaper, said Quayle inquired as to whether he might
be sent to Vietnam as part of a Guard unit. ``He wondered if it was
subject to call,'' Phillippi said.
   ``I just called the military department and said, `Here's a good
man, you ought to take him','' Phillippi said. ``It was just as I
have done for many young men over many years. ... I was just a peon
calling the military department. I had no power.''
   Some Guard units were activated and sent to Vietnam, including
at least one from Indiana.

<HEAD>Judge Removes Himself From Criminal Cases After Questionable
Remarks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week after suggesting to a newspaper
columnist that a 12-year-old boy who was sexually molested ``might
have enjoyed it,'' a judge has removed himself from major criminal
cases.
   ``Extensive controversy can impair the judicial process in
criminal cases,'' Superior Judge Seymour Hendel said as he
announced his decision Thursday in a statement to The Day of New
London, whose columnist, Steven Slosberg, disclosed the judge's
remarks about two child molestation cases.
   William R. Evans, 39, had confessed to using money to lure the
12-year-old boy into sex acts. In the other case, Edwin Diaz, 22,
admitted raping two girls, ages 7 and 9.
   In each case, a prosecutor reduced multiple sexual assault
charges to a single count of risk of injury to a minor. Hendel
ordered both men to undergo sex offender treatment as a condition
of probation.
   In Slosberg's Aug. 11 column, Hendel was quoted as saying the
case involving the 12-year-old boy was ``not a grave case,'' while
the sexual assault of the girls was ``a very bad case.''
   Speaking about the Evans case, Hendel was quoted as saying:
   ``There was no force used. ... If it wasn't for the disparity in
age, we might not have heard about it. For all I know, the kid
might have enjoyed it.''
   Hendel also was quoted in the column as saying the Diaz case
``was second-degree (sexual assault). There was no force.''
   The remarks drew criticism from the National Organization for
Women and the New London Women's Center.
   Hendel said in the letter to the newspaper Thursday that he has
been open with the media in his 10{ years on the bench.
   ``The recent controversy is a direct result of my openness,'' he
wrote. ``The content of the column does not represent my position
and views in sexual abuse cases and in no way reflects my concerns
and attitudes in these very serious and complex cases.
   ``I deeply regret that as a result of this telephone
conversation and the ensuing column, families and victims who have
been involved in sexual abuse cases may have been caused additional
anguish.''
   Slosberg said the judge never denied the accuracy of the quotes
but said they were taken out of context.
   Judge Aaron Ment, Connecticut's chief court administrator, said
Hendel's decision wouldn't affect the flow of cases.
   Hendel's comments were not a matter of review for his office,
but would be handled by the Judicial Review Council, Ment said. The
chairman and the executive director of the council were on vacation
Friday, according to secretaries at their offices. Another council
member, Michael J. Daly of Fairfield, said he had not heard of the
matter.

<HEAD>Campaign Abroad: Comment on Republican Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is some of what newspapers abroad had to say Friday on the
Republican convention and Vice President George Bush's choice of
Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate in the November presidential
election:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The Toronto Star (liberal): ``It's hard for a Canadian to
imagine that the Republican Party in the U.S. could move even
further right than it did during ... Reagan's time in office. But
it has. By choosing hard-line conservative Sen. Dan Quayle as his
running mate, Vice President George Bush has dispelled any illusion
that he's a political moderate.
   ``It's in foreign policy that a Bush administration's right may
cause reverberations in Canada and around the world. ... With
anti-communist rhetoric that echoes Reagan's `evil empire'
description of the Soviet Union, the Republicans seem to throw cold
water on negotiation as the way to settle conflicts.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SWEDEN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ Dagens Nyheter (liberal): ``The selection of Dan Quayle as
Bush's running mate is a way for the Republican Party to make up
for the lack of backbone that Bush has shown. ... If the extreme
right-wing voters of the party are to be mobilized in the election,
it is perhaps necessary that the vice president is a person of
their choice.
   ``Dan Quayle is one of Reagan's most loyal supporters, a
photogenic he-man who almost always votes with the extreme
right-wing of the party.''

   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who became acting
president with the death of Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, is considered a
cautious administrator with moderate views on international
economic and financial.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, the chairman of the senate, moved into the
nation's top position in accordance with the constitution after
Zia's death Wednesday.
   He served as chairman of the powerful development committee of
the World Bank and with the International Monetary Fund in the
early 1980s, trying to reach solutions to a number of issues
creating friction between the Third World and Western nations.
   At the time, the Third World and the West were squaring off over
Latin American debt, plans for development of the impoverished
African Sahara Desert and programs to provide more resources to
undeveloped nations.
   Ishaq Khan was born Jan. 20, 1915, at Ismail Khel, about 160
miles southwest of Islamabad, close to the Afghan border.
   He majored in chemistry and botany at the University of the
Punjab in Lahore.
   He joined the civil service in 1940 in then-British India and
was serving in the North-West Frontier province when Pakistan won
its freedom in 1947. He became the secretary of Pakistan cabinet in
1970.
   Ishaq Khan was appointed governor of the State Bank of Pakistan,
the nation's central bank, in 1971. He later served as defense
secretary, during which time he caught the attention of Zia, who
was army chief of staff.
   Zia in 1979 made Ishaq Khan minister for finance, commerce and
planning.
   Six years later, the minister was elected to the senate,
becoming chairman on March 21, 1985.
   Under the constitution, the chairman of parliament's upper house
becomes head of the government when the president is incapacitated
or dies.
   The acting president speaks his native Pushtu, Urdu, and
English, and has traveled widely.

   Singer George Jones was hospitalized for
the fifth time in 13 months and was released Friday after being
treated for a severe sinus infection, a hospital spokesman said.
   Jones, 56, known for country standards such as ``He Stopped
Loving Her Today'' and ``The Race is On,'' arrived at University
Hospital on Sunday, said spokesman Hank Black.
   ``He said his head was hurting and his ears were ringing,'' said
Black. ``He told his wife he couldn't go on and had better go back
to the hospital.''
   Jones, who has battled drug and alcohol problems, received
intravenous antibiotics to combat the ``longstanding'' sinus
infection, Black said. He will continue to take medication.
   His string of trips to University Hospital started in July 1987
when he was admitted with a stomach ailment. In October he was
hospitalized with severe nausea, and two months later he was
treated for an unspecified problem, said Black. In May, Jones was
hospitalized for several days for double pneumonia, said the
spokesman.
   Jones formerly lived in the north Alabama town of Tuscumbia but
now lives in Texas.

<HEAD>Dallas Police Issue Deadly Force Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officials say a need to shed more light on
their operations prompted them to make public the department's
deadly force policy for the first time.
   The policy is an amended, simplified version of a plan that has
been in effect since 1984, according to police spokesman Ed
Spencer. The revised version takes effect Monday.
   The policy states deadly force can be used ``only as a last
resort'' and ``only when other, reasonable alternatives are
impractical or fail.'' It prohibits the use of deadly force to
protect property and forbids officers from firing warning shots.
   Dallas police have drawn criticism from minority group leaders
in the past year for being too quick to shoot at suspects. Last
summer a congressional subcommittee conducted a hearing into the
department's deadly force policy, prompted by two white officers'
slayings of two elderly blacks in unrelated cases. The department
hired outside consultants to review its policy.
   ``We just feel it's important for the community to know the high
standard the police place on the use of deadly force,'' acting
Assistant Chief Marlin Price said Thursday.
   Some police had argued that releasing the policy would let
criminals know what acts they could commit without fearing
officers' use of weapons. But city officials praised the revision
and releasing it to the public.
   ``I think it indicates their (the police department's) openness
and their willingness to let us all know what the rules are,'' said
City Council member Craig Holcomb, chairman of the city's Public
Safety Committee. ``Previously, even council members ... didn't
know what the deadly force policy was.''

<HEAD>Commission Pledges to Root Out Those Who Supported Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a Politburo commission studying the
bloody history of Josef Stalin's purges pledged in an interview
published Friday to root out those who blindly carried out the
dictator's wishes.
   Mikhail S. Solomentsev told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
that since it began its work last October the commission had
cleared the names of 636 people who were shot or imprisoned by
Stalin.
   He also revealed that an investigation was under way into the
murder in December 1934 of Sergei Kirov, the popular Leningrad
party leader who opposed Stalin's absolute power. Some Western
historians believe Stalin was responsible for the murder but
accused his political opponents in order to destroy them.
   ``Many people are guilty of abuses: some of them were named,
some not,'' Solomentsev said. ``The measure of the guilt of every
one of them will be determined.''
   ``The personal guilt of Stalin and the people closest to him
before the party and people for the mass repressions and
lawlessness is dreadful,'' he said. ``But the guilt of the leaders
does not relieve of responsibility the voluntary executors, those
directly involved in the infringement of socialist law, those who
supported and blindly fulfilled inhumane instructions, committed
outrages.''
   Stalin ruled the Soviet Union from 1924-53, and some estimates
say he was responsible for as many as 20 million deaths. Although
the senior officials who helped him are nearly all dead, other
officials who started their careers in Stalin's last years are in
positions of responsibility throughout the country.
   The issue of clearing the names of those who were repressed by
Stalin and politically rehabilitating them is one of deep
significance for Soviets.
   For many of them, it means clearing a close relative.
   Clearing Stalin's victims also gives Soviets an indication of
what direction the leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev wants to take
the country.
   Soviets watch their leadership's evaluation of history closely
because it very often is an indication of the party's goals.
Gorbachev has said he wants to clear those purged by Stalin to show
Soviets they have nothing to fear from speaking their minds.
   Solomentsev, 74, is head of the party Control Commission, which
reviews charges of misconduct within party ranks.
   At a Communist Party conference in Moscow at the end of June,
former Moscow party chief Boris N. Yeltsin accused him of
tolerating corruption among party workers, and another speaker
suggested he should retire.
   After Stalin's death, Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev
launched the first review of the repression, but Solomentsev said
the work was not completed and did not cover abuses committed
before 1934.
   He said the commission is reviewing Soviet archives and appealed
to the public for information to help complete a thorough review of
the terror. It already has received 3,000 letters and applications
from members of the public, he said.
   ``We are equally interested in the fate of prominent leaders of
the party and the Soviet state and the rank-and-file citizens:
workers, peasants, office workers, party, government and economic
functionaries, intellectuals,'' he said.
   Solomentsev said the commission had already cleared 636 people
and that many other cases were still under review.
   Among those whose names have been cleared this year of the
criminal charges made against them by Stalin's prosecutors are
prominent Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev
Kamenev. Each was a rival for the power that Stalin took for
himself.
   They and many other prominent figures were shot or died in
prison camps during Stalin's purges of the 1930s.
   Sixty-eight people have been readmitted to party rolls,
including Bukharin, whose economic polices serve as a model for
some of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Restoration of party membership is the final act of
rehabilitating those repressed by Stalin because it establishes not
only that they were not guilty of criminal actions but that their
political views were acceptable within the party.
   Among Stalin's victims were hundreds of thousands of Balts,
Crimean Tatars and ethnic Germans accused during World War II of
collaborating with Nazi occupiers.
   Stalin also ordered the brutal drive for collectivization of
agriculture in the 1930s, when peasants who refused to leave their
land for state farms were shot as examples to others and hundreds
of thousands starved to death.
   The commission is reviewing requests of relatives to compensate
them for the suffering of their families by giving them better
apartments, benefits and returning confiscated property, he said.

   Here are some facts and figures on the costs of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CASUALTIES _ At least 300,000 Iranians were killed and 600,000
wounded through 1987, with corresponding casualties for Iraq of
120,000 killed and 300,000 wounded, said Anthony Cordesman in his
book ``The Iran-Iraq War and Western Security.'' He said the
estimates were conservative. By some accounts the dead total 1
million and the wounded 1.7 million.
   Neither country provided comprehensive numbers during the war.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of
$35 billion and now owes an estimated $60 billion. Iran has not
borrowed but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few
billion dollars.
   La Tribune, an financial journal published in Paris, estimates
Iran needs $80 billion and Iraq $30 billion to rebuild
transportation, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and
hospitals.
   The cost to the combatants, according to Israeli experts who
followed the war closely, was more than $200 billion through 1986.
This included lost revenues, damaged and destroyed buildings,
industrial plants, ships and military equipment.
   Iran and Iraq have not disclosed figures for arms purchases or
economic damage.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OIL FACILITIES _ A report by Kiyotaki Tsuji of the Japanese
Institute of Middle East Economic Studies estimated damage to oil
installations from bombing and shelling raids amounted to $28
billion for Iran and $8 billion for Iraq.
   Losses in oil revenues, estimated by Tsuji, are $23 billion for
Iran and $65 billion for Iraq. Pre-war production in Iraq was 3.6
million barrels a day. It fell to 1.2 million barrels a day in 1981
and gradually has been built back to 2.7 million barrels a day.
   Iraqi bombing raids decimated Iran's refining capacity from 1.3
million barrels a day to 400,000 barrels a day, oil experts
estimate.
   Iraqi raids damaged or disabled Iranian refineries at Abadan,
Isfahan, Shiraz, Tehran and Bakhtaran. The billion-dollar oil
loading facility at Kharg Island is virtually destroyed.
   Early in the war Iraq lost its 140,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery
at Basra. The port was closed.

<TEXT>
   SHIPPING _ Lloyd's, the London insurance exchange, reported 90
ships sunk or destroyed in the Persian Gulf and 546 attacked, with
at least 300 sailors killed and 300 injured. Ninety-three ships
from the combatants or neutral countries were trapped in Iraqi
waterways throughout the war, many of them written off. Lloyd's
said its underwriters paid more than $1 billion in ship claims and
other insurers a like amount.

<HEAD>Film Blamed for Lower Test Scores of Students of Famed Teacher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Stand and Deliver'' celebrated on film
the success of a real inner-city high school calculus teacher and
his students, but in an ironic twist the film apparently led to a
drop in the latest test scores.
   The dip in the James A. Garfield High School scores wasn't
dramatic, but bore out instructor Jaime Escalante's concerns,
according to his principal.
   ``He said the kids saw the movie so many times they thought
passing the test was going to be as easy as the movie made it out
to be,'' Principal Maria Elena Tostado said Thursday. ``He said
they didn't know it was so much hard work.''
   The Warner Bros. film, starring Edward James Olmos as Escalante,
told the story of the instructor's phenomenal success in teaching
calculus to average students at Garfield in 1982, and their triumph
over accusations that they cheated on the advanced placement exam.
   According to College Board results, 55 of the 119 Garfield
students who took the rigorous mathematics exam in May got a
passing score of 3 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5.
   That represents a passing rate of 46 percent, down from 65
percent last year.
   This year's percentage was the lowest in the nine years the test
has been offered at Garfield. However, more students took the test
this year than in any previous year except 1987.
   ``We went a little down, but that's OK, considering all the
confusion and activity we had all year long,'' Ms. Tostado said.
   In interviews after the movie opened, Escalante said constant
interruptions by visitors _ including Vice President George Bush _
were distracting and that ``the kids are paying for it.''
   The school, which serves a poor community where few parents have
college educations, ranked sixth in the nation among all schools
that had passing scores on the beginning calculus exam and 59th
among schools that had passing marks on the advanced calculus test.

<HEAD>Pilot Makes Emergency Landing With 400 Lobsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single-engine plane carrying 400 live lobsters
made an emergency landing Friday in a park outside a prison.
   Pilot Carsten Petersen said his Cessna 206 developed engine
trouble west of London while flying from the Outer Hebrides islands
off Scotland to Le Touquet in northern France.
   He was cleared to make an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport,
but the engine problem forced him to land on the first open terrain
he could find: a recreation ground behind Wormwood Scrubs prison in
west London.
   The 46-year-old pilot and his cargo of crustaceans were
unscathed, but the plane cannot be removed without taking off its
wings, and Petersen said the lobsters were unlikely to continue
their journey to French gourmet restaurants.
   ``The lobsters are sick of flying,'' he said.
   Their reprieve was only temporary, however. The dealer who
arranged the flight is diverting the shellfish to London
restaurants, and a colleague was dispatched to pick them up.
   ``If you go into a good London restaurant you might get one,''
Petersen said.

<HEAD>Quiet Grief On Anniversary Of Worst British Mass Murder</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with Sylvester Stallone calling off
trip, no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HUNGERFORD, Britain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of Hungerford grieved
quietly Friday, the first anniversary of the worst mass murder in
modern British history in which a man killed 16 people and wounded
13 others before committing suicide.
   The streets of the market town 60 miles west of London were
nearly deserted and most of its shops were closed. A small vase of
flowers sat on the Town Hall steps and its flag flew at half-staff.
   ``People just want to try to put the past behind them and look
towards the future,'' said the Rev. David Salt, the local Church of
England vicar.
   ``Most of the bereaved are away from the town today. They just
want to be with themselves at this time.''
   A former mayor, Ron Tarry, said ``today is hopefully the final
chapter in this tragedy. The people of Hungerford now hope they can
get on with their lives without being in the press and on TV.''
   Michael Ryan, a 27-year-old unemployed loner and gun enthusiast,
stalked the streets and parks of his hometown and surrounding
countryside for seven hours Aug. 19, 1987, shooting neighbors and
strangers with an arsenal of weapons.
   He killed 16 of them, including his mother, wounded another 13,
shot his dog to death, and burned down his mother's home and two
others before holing up in an empty school. When police surrounded
the building and tried to talk him into surrendering, he killed
himself.
   Ryan left no suicide note to explain the massacre. Neighbors
said he was deeply affected by his father's death two years earlier
and psychiatrists speculated he suffered from acute schizophrenia.
   Some of those affected by the tragedy are still receiving
counseling from a special family support unit set up within hours
of the shootings.
   ``It is a hard day for a lot of people,'' said the unit's
coordinator, Tony Stacey, a retired social worker. ``Many would
rather be out of town. Any reminder of what happened is going to be
hard for people.''
   Britain's rough-and-tumble popular press dubbed the killer
``Rambo,'' after the bellicose movie character played by actor
Sylvester Stallone.
   Stallone called off his trip to Britain, scheduled to begin
Saturday, said his London publicist Bernard Doherty. The visit was
intended to promote the movie ``Rambo III.''
   Doherty said the decision stemmed from changes in the movie's
pre-production schedule _ not British complaints related to the
anniversary of the murders.
   Mary Whitehouse, an outspoken media critic, had called
Stallone's planned visit ``insensitive.'' The local member of
Parliament, Michael McNair-Wilson, had also urged Stallone to
reconsider his schedule.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Friday he is glad the Pentagon came forward with a detailed account
of the July 3 Iran airline disaster on the day it occurred even
though several key details were wrong.
   A final investigative report released Friday found that
inexperience and the stress of battle _ ``the fog of war'' _ led
the crew of the Vincennes to reach several erroneous conclusions,
which Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, in turn had reported as fact.
   The conclusions included:
   _The airliner was transmitting a signal identifying it as a
warplane.
   _The plane was outside a commercial air corridor.
   _It was descending and accelerating as it approached the
Vincennes, a flight pattern similar to that of an attacking fighter.
   Those mistakes have been at the heart of the controversy over
why the USS Vincennes mistook an Iran Air A-300 Airbus for an F-14
fighter and shot it down, killing all 290 people aboard.
   Carlucci told a Pentagon news conference Friday that ``on the
day that the incident occurred, Admiral Crowe appeared before you
and made available virtually every scrap of information that he had
in our possession. This was a deliberate decision.''
   ``And Admiral Crowe stated repeatedly that our initial
information was preliminary and very likely to prove false in some
instances. Nonetheless, we decided to go ahead with it, running the
risk that there would be stories that the Pentagon had put out
mistaken information,'' Carlucci said.
   On July 3, Crowe told reporters that Iran Air Flight 655 was
outside a commercial air corridor and was descending and
accelerating.
   The final report found that ``IR 655 was not an the exact center
of airway A-59, but was 3.37 nautical miles west of the centerline.
However, it was in the assigned airway.''
   And it said that ``at no time did IR 655 actually descend in
altitude prior to engagement.''
   Crowe also said on July 3 that the airplane was was emitting
electronic signals that led the Vincennes to conclude that the
plane was an F-14.
   Several days later, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard told reporters
the Airbus had been broadcasting its position on a device known as
an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponder in Mode 3, used
by both civilian and military aircraft, and in Mode 2, used only by
military aircraft.
   The final report said the Mode 2 reading was a mistake, and that
human error apparently led operators aboard the Vincennes to
receive an IFF signal from a military aircraft at the Bandar Abbas
airfield, from which Flight 655 took off, and mistakenly conclude
that the Airbus was military.
   That initial error led to the identification of the airliner as
hostile just over three minutes into its flight, and was not
corrected during the remaining three minutes and 40 seconds before
it was blasted from the sky by two SM-2 Standard missiles from the
Vincennes.
   Because the operator apparently failed to adjust the IFF
receiver aboard the Vincennes to account for the approach of the
aircraft, the report said, ``the Mode 2 transmission from an
aircraft on the ground would then be displayed'' and ``could have
been generated by a military aircraft (C-130, F-4, F-14) located on
the ground at Bandar Abbas.''
   The crew of the Vincennes may have made the mistakes, the report
said, because they were fighting Iranian gunboats, were heeling
over at a 32-degree angle while maneuvering to fight off the boats,
and had in their minds the attack by Iraq on May 17, 1987 against
the USS Stark in which 37 American sailors died.
   ``The fog of war and those human elements which affect each
individual differently _ not the least of which was the thought of
the Stark incident _ are factors that must be considered,'' the
report said.

<HEAD>Landlord Pays $12,000 for Discriminating Against Couple With
Children</HEAD>

   A landlord who allegedly denied an apartment to a
couple because they had children has agreed to pay them $12,000
compensation, the Boston Fair Housing Commission said.
   ``A settlement of this type sends out the message that children
have fair housing rights _ and that in the city of Boston, we're
enforcing those rights,'' said the commission's executive director,
Ernest B. Gutierrez Jr.
   Gayle and Donald Guilford, both 34, had sought to rent a
three-bedroom apartment in Boston for themselves and their four
daughters, ages 1, 2, 12 and 14.
   A real estate agent told the Guilfords the apartment was
available, but, Gutierrez said, landlord Gary Gwozdzik rejected the
Guilfords, allegedly violating a 1982 city ordinance prohibiting
discrimination against families with children.
   The Guilford's attorney, Nadine Cohen, said Gwozdzik told the
couple ``that he would not rent to them because of their children.''
   But the landlord's attorney, Stephen A. Greenbaum, said his
client ``vehemently denies ever discriminating'' against the
Guilfords.
   Greenbaum said his ``client, who is an average working guy who
owns a total of five apartment units in the whole world, has to pay
his own legal fees, and he simply could not afford the cost of
litigating this case out through the Fairing Housing Commission and
the courts.''
   Greenbaum said Gwozdzik rejected the Guilfords as tenants
because he thought six people were too many for the apartment.
   Under state sanitary codes, three bedrooms are adequate for a
family of six.
   The settlement was reached Monday.

   A gas leak in a steering engine
compartment was sealed by technicians Friday, another step toward
clearing the space shuttle Discovery for launch in late September
or early October.
   Working in cramped quarters in Discovery's up-ended cargo bay,
the workers bolted a clamshell-like device on a one-half-inch
diameter fuel line that was detected leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas
more than a month ago.
   Once the 2-inch clamp was in place, the technicians filled it
with a sealing compound. Then they subjected the line to pressure
tests, and NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson reported initial data
indicated the leak had been plugged. He said the seal would be
monitored for several days to be sure there was no additional
leakage.
   If the seal holds as expected, and if initially encouraging
results of a solid fuel booster rocket test in Utah hold up, the
space agency may set a date next week for launching Discovery on
the first shuttle mission since Challenger exploded and killed its
crew of seven on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Officials have been considering a launch in late September or
early October, with Sept. 29 listed as one internal planning date.
   An intentionally flawed booster was fired for two minutes
Thursday at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah in the fifth and final
pre-flight test of the redesigned rocket. A faulty joint in a
booster was blamed for the Challenger accident.
   ``We're ready to fly; it looks like an absolutely great test
from top to bottom,'' said Royce Mitchell, NASA's solid rocket
booster project manager.
   However, officials said that while initial results looked great,
it would take several days to thoroughly analyze the test data.
   To reach the nitrogen tetroxide leak, workers Wednesday used an
electric router to drill holes through the rear wall of Discovery's
60-foot-long cargo bay and through the adjoining hull of a steering
engine compartment.
   The tiny leak was 12 inches from the newly drilled access
panels, on a fitting in a vent line.
   Because Discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad, the
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground, forcing the
technicians to work on their hands and knees. They worked in a
cramped quarters surrounded by a tent-like canvas to prevent loose
debris from reaching other areas of the shuttle.
   When the leak was discovered more than a month ago, officials at
first feared they might have to move Discovery off the launch pad
to a hangar for repairs, a move that could have delayed the launch
for as much as two months, into November.
   But engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the
fix on the pad.
   The repair job was delayed until after the launch team conducted
a successful test firing last week of Discovery's three liquid fuel
main engines. The leak is in a separate engine system used to steer
the shuttle in orbit.

<HEAD>Family Seeks Release Of Jailed Black Leader's Medical Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of jailed black
activist Nelson Mandela on Friday requested the government to
release his medical records to determine whether prison conditions
may have contributed to his contracting tuberculosis.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National
Congress, was transferred a week ago from the Pollsmoor Prison in
Cape Town to nearby Tygerberg Hospital.
   Reports of his illness triggered a wave of new appeals at home
and abroad for his release after 26 years in jail.
   A statement issued on behalf of the Mandela family by
anti-apartheid activists said Mandela was receiving good care at
Tygerberg. But it questioned whether conditions at Pollsmoor may
have contributed to the disease or whether doctors there could have
made a quicker diagnosis.
   Doctors have said the prognosis for Mandela's recovery is good
and treatment is expected to take about five months.
   The statement asked that Mandela's medical records be released
to his family ``to dispel the nagging doubts existing in their
minds.'' It was signed by the Rev. Beyers Naude, a white
anti-apartheid activist on behalf of a new group called the Mandela
Crisis Committee.
   Mandela's illness presents South African President P.W. Botha
with one of the toughest dilemmas of his 10 years in power.
   The president, who has faced rising pressure to free Mandela,
knows that violence could break out if the leader dies in jail. But
he also knows that releasing the leader of the biggest guerrilla
group fighting white rule would anger the right wing and could
trigger renewed black activism as nationwide municipal elections
approach on Oct. 26.
   On Thursday, Botha said Mandela's release was under serious
consideration and indicated the government was trying to Mandela to
accept its condition that he renounce violence.
   Mandela, jailed since 1962, is serving a life sentence for
plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the government and its
apartheid system of racial segregation.
   Neither the ANC nor Mandela's family have issued a formal
response to Botha's remarks. But the statement issued by the
activists Friday said Mandela ``has made his position very clear
regarding the issue of violence.''
   Mandela rejected a previous offer of conditional release, saying
he would not renounce violence until the government legalized the
ANC, dismantled apartheid and opened negotiations aimed at granting
full political rights to the black majority.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg daily, quoted
unidentified government sources as saying there was no possibility
of Mandela's release before the October elections, which will mark
the first time that blacks and whites across the country vote on
the same day.
   The government depicts the event as a major step toward
democracy and has outlawed calls for an election boycott.
   But anti-apartheid groups have made clear they reject the
election as an attempt to entrench a segregated political system.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Cattle in North Dakota Tested for Tuberculosis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Sheyenne in 5th graf cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 14,000 cattle in North Dakota are
being tested for bovine tuberculosis, and authorities are tracing
cattle sold in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas that might
have been exposed to the infectious disease, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   James Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said federal and state officials
traced the suspected cattle to a herd in Wyndmere, N.D.
   ``This herd and two exposed herds were then placed under
quarantine and tested for signs of tuberculosis,'' he said. ``So
far, 32 animals that reacted to the test have been sent to
slaughter, where a number of them showed evidence of tuberculosis
on postmortem inspection.''
   Glosser said the tuberculosis lesions were detected in early
July during routine inspection at a West Fargo, N.D., slaughter
plant.
   He said the inspection service is taking steps to locate and
test exposed herds as insurance against further spread of the
disease.
   All the exposed cattle are owned by members of the Sheyenne
Grazing Association of North Dakota and are being tested by state
and federal teams. The cattle were said to feed on the same
grassland as the herd of origin and could have come into contact
with infected animals.
   Bovine tuberculosis can be spread among cattle through
inhalation or by contaminated food and water sources, he said.
Humans can become infected by drinking unpasteurized milk from
diseased cows.
   ``Because bovine tuberculosis can have a long incubation period,
a cow purchased today with a latent infection can eventually infect
other animals even if it shows no signs of the disease,'' Glosser
said. ``Clinical symptoms are not distinctive for many years after
initial infection.''

<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said Chile's
single-candidate presidential referendum will take place in early
October.
   Gen. Pinochet, who has ruled since a 1973 military coup, is
widely expected to be the lone candidate.
   In a separate appearance Wednesday, Pinochet also flatly
dismissed requests by the Roman Catholic Church for appointment of
a ``candidate of consensus,'' acceptable both to the government and
the opposition.
   The candidate will be nominated on Aug. 30 by the comanders of
the three armed services and the national police. If the candidate
wins, he will serve an eight-year term starting March 11, 1989. If
he is rejected, Pinochet will remain in power until an open
election on Dec. 14, 1989.
   As commander in chief of the army, the 72-year-old Pinochet will
participate in the candidate's selection.
   Other officials have hinted that Chile's first presidential
balloting in 18 years will be on Oct. 5.

<HEAD>Algae Slicks Scare Off Tourists, Kill Fish</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smelly, slimy slicks of algae along Italy's
northern Adriatic coast are scaring away tourists, killing fish and
sparking cries for an end to the dumping of untreated wastes into
the sea.
   Mayors of seaside resorts in the Romagna region _ with its
jammed beach establishments one next to the other _ say tourists
have fled and reservations for the rest of the season are down. The
algae problem is only getting worse.
   ``It's like swimming in mash,'' said Alberta De Lorenzi, a
Milanese who took vacation near the resort of Rimini. ``My children
swim in the hotel pool. The algae make tough going on
paddle-boats.''
   Authorities say the decaying algae won't make bathers ill.
   Algae thrive on raw sewage and certain chemical pollutants,
including phosphates from detergents. Both are being dumped into
the sea off the northeastern coast of Italy. The Po River is
estimated to carry more than 4,000 tons of phosphates into the
Adriatic every year.
   The multiplying algae consume the sea's oxygen, which in turn
kills the fish. The foul odor from the decaying fish makes the
beach even less inviting.
   This problem was especially bad off the coast at Chioggia and
Ravenna, a big tourist draw with its magnificent, well-preserved
mosaics. Other stricken areas include Venice and Pesaro, a music
festival town in the Marche region and a favorite vacation haunt
for West Germans.
   Some action is being taken.
   Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo said a bill would be
presented in Parliament that would set the volume of phosphates in
cleaning products at 1 percent instead of the current 2.5 percent.
   Mayors of Adriatic resort towns urged the government to enforce
laws that prohibit industry and farms from dumping untreated
pollutants into the sea.
   They also are demanding a state of emergency and more money to
clear the waters of decaying algae. Last month, the national
government set aside the equivalent of $2.2 million to help Venice
fight its algae problem.
   ``We risk ruining the tourist season and producing thousands of
unemployed,'' Nando Fabbri, the mayor of Bellaria, told Turin's
daily La Stampa.
   Bruno Casadei, professor of ecology problems at the University
of Urbino, not far from Pesaro, predicted the situation will worsen.
   ``Slow-moving currents and shallow depth will turn the Adriatic
into a permanent sludge,'' he said. Those factors make it difficult
for the sea to flush itself clean of the pollutants, he said.

   Tamil separatist fighting killed 20
people, with most of the deaths occurring when Indian soldiers
enforcing a peace accord stormed two rebel encampments, official
reports said Friday.
   Victims of those raids included 11 Tamils, who are fighting for
an independent homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of
the troubled island, and one Indian trooper, the reports said.
   A Sri Lankan soldier and six civilians also were killed during
the time period, the reports said.
   Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of the country's 16
million people, say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese who control the government.
   The 11 guerrillas were killed Thursday when Indian troops
stormed a rebel camp near Cheddikulam, about 135 miles north of the
capital of Colombo, said an official for the Indian High Commission
or embassy.
   India has 47,000 Indian soldiers in Sri Lanka to oversee a peace
agreement aimed at ending the 5-year-old civil war.
   About seven miles south of the first base, Indian troops stormed
an abandoned rebel camp in the jungle, said the Indian official,
who asked not to be identified. One soldier was killed and two
injured by hidden explosives.
   Indian officials said 10 Tamil guerrillas were injured and 60
captured in the two operations.
   Indian troops near Jaffna, about 185 miles north of Colombo,
shot and killed three Tamil civilians Thursday, said a spokesman
for the Sri Lankan Joint Operations Command.
   The troops opened fire after Tamil guerrillas ambushed an Indian
patrol, killing one soldier and seriously injuring three others,
the spokesman said.
   He said a Sri Lankan army lieutenant was killed and another
lietuenant seriously injured in an ambush by insurgents in
Trincomalee, about 145 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Sinhalese extremists killed three civilians Thursday in Elkaduwa
village, 80 miles south of Colombo, the spokesman said.
   The militants wielding guns and swords stormed a funeral home,
chose their victims and then hacked them to death, he said. They
also threatened to kill others who suppported the Sri Lankan
government.
   Authorities said the killers belong to the Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front, which has killed more than 420 people in the past
12 months. Most of the victims have been Sinhalese who support the
government of President Junius R. Jayewardeene and the
Indian-brokered peace accord signed in 1987 to try to end the
5-year-old civil war.
   Members of the front oppose the peace plan saying it grants too
many concessions to the Tamils.
   Moderate Tamils have been demanding self-rule in the north and
east. Extremists, however, want a separate state and have killed
more than 8,500 in their campaign.

<HEAD>Aquino Will Permit Marcos to Come Home to Face Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Friday
she will abide by a legal ruling that would allow former president
Ferdinand Marcos to come home in November to face an accuser in
court.
   Marcos said Friday he will ask to do so.
   Presidential spokesman Marcial Carreon quoted Mrs. Aquino as
saying she would ``respect the decision of the court,'' even if it
meant allowing Marcos to return.
   Marcos has lived in Hawaii since his ouster in a 1986
civilian-military uprising. Mrs. Aquino has refused to let him
return, citing security concerns. Her government put down a coup
attempt in January 1987, which she said was aimed at restoring
Marcos to power.
   An anti-graft court ruled Thursday that the ousted president had
a right to be present when his former public works secretary
testifies against him about questionable contracts awarded during
his 20-year presidency.
   The Nov. 7 hearing is not a trial but a ``perpetuation
proceeding'' to take testimony from former government minister
Baltazar Aquino, who court officials say is gravely ill.
   Baltazar Aquino, who is not related to the president, is to
testify about allegedly illegal contracts granted to Japanese firms
during Marcos' reign.
   Under Philippine law, his testimony can be used against Marcos
at a trial, even if the witness is dead. But Justice Augusto Amores
said the testimony could be used in court only if Marcos had the
opportunity to cross-examine the witness.
   The court said Marcos had the constitutional right to appear at
the proceedings, ``which cannot be denied to him in the absence of
more cogent reasons.'' Amores said Marcos could appear personally
or be represented by counsel.
   ``I directed my lawyer to seek the court order for me to come
home and defend myself in the proceedings,'' Marcos told Filipino
reporters by telephone from his exile home in Hawaii. ``I want to
represent myself,'' said Marcos, who is a lawyer.
   Marcos said his former minister had been pressured into agreeing
to testify because of his poor health.
   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez said he opposed allowing
Marcos to come home and believed his presence was unnecessary if he
were represented by counsel.
   ``There are questions of national security,'' Chavez said.
``It's not a purely legal question.''
   Marcos has never been charged with any criminal offense, despite
allegations of wrongdoing while in office. Marcos has warned that
if criminal charges are filed, he would dismiss his lawyer, Rafael
Recto, and demand the right to represent himself.
   Philippine law allows defendants to be represented by counsel of
their choice and bars criminal trials in absentia. Government
sources say those regulations are largely responsible for the delay
in filing criminal charges against Marcos.
   Swiss authorities have expressed reluctance in lifting banking
secrecy laws until criminal charges against Marcos are filed. The
Philippine government believes Marcos stashed millions of dollars
in secret Swiss bank accounts, although he denies the claim.
   In its ruling, the court authorized the Philippine consul in
Honolulu to serve notice of the proceedings to Marcos and to
publish the announcement in newspapers there for three consecutive
weeks.
   In May, Mrs. Aquino turned down a request by Marcos to return
here for the burial of his mother, Josefa, who died May 4.
   The body of Marcos' mother is unburied. Marcos said her burial
would be ``my first duty'' after his return.

   Two bombs exploded near civil guard patrol
cars in northern Spain, injuring five paramilitary guards,
officials said.
   A civil guard spokesman told Spanish National Radio that the
Basque terrorist group ETA was suspected in both attacks. He said
guards were searching for more bombs.
   The first explosion occurred as a three-car civil guard convoy
reached a crossroads near Eibar, 12 miles south of the Basque
coastal city of San Sebastian, a civil governor's office spokesman
said.
   Three guards were treated for burns as a result of the blast,
which scattered shrapnel and hurled the middle patrol car into a
cement wall, the spokesman said.
   Three hours later, officials said a second bomb exploded 25
miles west near the town of Aracaldo, as a civil guard vehicle went
under a bridge. That blast injured two guards, one seriously.
   ETA, which stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people since taking up arms in 1968. Most were paramilitary civil
guards, police and military officers.
   This year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks that
killed six people.

   The Louisiana Superdome's metamorphosis from
a place for presidential politics back to the world's largest
indoor football stadium was in full swing Friday.
   What took weeks to build for the Republican National Convention,
which ended Thursday night, will take a few days to tear down.
   ``It's almost sad,'' said Will Peneguy, a Superdome spokesman.
``We watched them put the podium up, there was so much detail work,
craftsmanship. It was sad even then knowing it was going to have to
come down.''
   A backhoe chomped down on the $560,000 podium, from which George
Bush had accepted the GOP presidential nomination the night before,
smashing it to smithereens in minutes.
   Greg Lane, operations manager for The Freeman Cos., watched the
backhoe operator demolish his firm's hard work without so much as a
sigh.
   ``We're in the convention business, so no, it's not (sad),'' he
said.
   It will take 8,000 man-hours to rip up the 1.2 million pounds of
scaffolding, tear up the 150,000 square feet of plywood and take
out the 150,000 nuts, bolts and screws that made up the podium,
stairways and wooden floors.
   The red carpets New Orleans rolled out for the GOP had been
pulled up from the Dome floor and the decorative trees were being
hauled out on trolleys.
   A few of Thursday night's red, white and blue balloons were
still mixed in with the broken-down scaffolding and scrap lumber
being carted off.
   Confetti dusted the floors and handmade Bush-Quayle signs were
crammed into garbage cans.
   ``I think it looks a lot different from last night,'' said Bobby
Franks, operations manager for South Central Bell Telephone Co.
``What you have here is a transformation from the Republican
National Convention look to the football stadium look, and it will
end up looking like the magnificent building that it is.''
   South Central Bell worked from midnight Thursday to 8 a.m.,
tearing down the thousands of feet of cable installed for the
convention.
   The convention required 9,000 lines of cable compared with the
last major Dome event, a Super Bowl with 1,000 cable lines.
   The Dome must be restored to its former self by Thursday, Lane
said.
   ``Everything's going right on schedule,'' Peneguy said. ``We'd
like it finished in time for the Gatorade Jamboree (a prep football
doubleheader) on Friday.''
   The following day, Aug. 27, the New Orleans Saints host the
Pittsburgh Steelers at the Superdome in their final preseason
National Football League game.

   Farmers in all of Michigan are eligible to
apply for Farmers Home Admininstration emergency loans to help
cover part of their crop drought losses, the Agriculture Department
said Friday.
   Undersecretary Roland Vautour said farmers in all of the state's
83 counties have eight months in which to apply for the loans to
cover part of their actual losses.
   To be eligible, farmers must be able to repay the FmHA loans and
any other loans, must be unable to get credit elsewhere, and have
adequate security.
   Michigan is the 14th entire state designated eligible for FmHA
emergency drought loans. Others are Alabama, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Defends Intervention in Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's intervention that crushed
Czechoslovakia's ``Prague Spring'' 20 years ago saved the country
from irresponsible leadership and possible brutual repression of
communists, Tass said Friday.
   A commentary by the official Soviet news agency was the first
comment by the Soviets on the anniversary of the Aug. 20-21, 1968,
crushing of a liberalization campaign in Czechoslovakia by the
Soviet Union.
   ``Anti-socialist forces, taking advantage of political
irresponsibilty and opportunism of a part of the leadership of the
Communist Party of Czechoslovakia of that time, made an attempt ...
to tear Czechoslovakia away from the socialist community,'' Tass
said. ``The friends and allies of socialist Czechoslovakia could
not remain indifferent,'' it said.
   ``Czechoslovak society was threatened with a possibility that
accounts would be settled with upright communists in a brutal
way,'' Tass said.
   The commentary by news analyst Alexander Kondrashov was
consistent with past Soviet statements on the ``Prague Spring,''
but contrasted sharply with an article in the current issue of the
weekly Arguments and Facts.
   In the article, historian L.S. Yagodovsky compared the goals of
the Czechoslovak reforms with those efforts by Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in the Soviet Union. Yagodovsky also drew the conclusion that the
intervention by soldiers from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact
allies was necessary because Czechoslovak leaders could not control
the reform movement.
   Gorbachev is trying to loosen state control of the Soviet
economy, while encouraging more open discussion of current policy
and past mistakes.
   The intervention stopped the liberalization campaign begun under
Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubcek, who was replaced the
following year by Gustav Husak.
   Husak ran one of the more conservative Soviet bloc organizations
until he stepped down late last year.
   Tass said calls from the West for the Soviet Union to admit it
made a mistake in Czechoslovakia ``have the aim to question not
only the policy of the U.S.S.R. and of Czechoslovakia but also the
entire process of positive changes in the world.''
   American leaders such as President Lyndon B. Johnson were
interested in tearing Czechoslovakia away from the Soviet Union
rather than the actual changes taking place in the country, it said.

   George Bush and Dan Quayle went back home to Quayle's Indiana on
Friday where the young vice presidential candidate defended his
National Guard service in a news conference amplified for an
appreciative town folk.
   The tougher the question, the louder the boos.
   The more forceful the answer, the louder the cheers.
   ``I got into the National Guard fairly,'' he said. ``I did not
ask anyone to break the rules and so far as I know no one did.''
   The Indianapolis News had reported Thursday that its former
managing editor, Wendell C. Phillippi, had been asked about
entering the Guard by Quayle.
   Phillippi was a former commander of the state National Guard.
   ``Wendell Phillippi knew that I wanted to get into the National
Guard and I hope that he helped me and I think he did,'' Quayle
told reporters. ``I would hope that he helped me and I expect
that.''
   But the 41-year-old, two-term senator said he saw nothing wrong
with that and would do the same thing again.
   With the Republican ticket riding a wave of optimism out of the
just-ended GOP convention in New Orleans, the Democratic duo of
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen were going their separate ways
before linking up Saturday in Texas.
   Bentsen said the GOP convention looked to him like a ``Mardi
Gras for the Moral Majority'' that ignored the concerns of working
people.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was playing a similar tune on a whistle-stop
trip through the scenic hills of Missouri and Arkansas.
   Before leaving New Orleans, Quayle joked about the controversy
when he and Bush appeared at a post-convention meeting of the
Republican National Committee in New Orleans.
   Adopting a military posture, his shoulders sqaured, his back
straight, Quayle shouted in a clipped voice: ``I stand at
attention. Name: Dan Quayle. Serial number: 303 50 4096. Indiana
National Guard, six years and proud of it.''
   The audience laughed and cheered.
   The conservative senator from Indiana, has been dogged by
questions about whether he used family influence to get into the
National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War, virtually assuring
he would avoid combat.
   Dukakis, on a whistle-stop train tour through Illinois, Missouri
and Arkansas, lost no time jibing at Bush's performance in New
Orleans.
   ``Last night we heard a lot of talk about missions,'' Dukakis
said at a trackside rally in Belleville, Ill.
   ``He talked a lot about missions, but I must have missed a
page,'' he said. ``We didn't hear a word from the Republicans about
the budget deficit or the trade deficit last night, or this week,
and we know why. They don't know how to deal with them.''
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, was in Dallas
where he said the Republican convention was dominated by the ``hard
right.''
   ``What we saw was the Republicans putting on a convention for
the far right,'' Bentsen said. ``They had a Mardi Gras for the
Moral Majority.''
   Bentsen also was asked about a report in Friday's Washington
Post that his blind trust invested in his son's business after
being steered there by the senator.
   He said he reported the trust's investment in his son's company.
``Frankly, I didn't have to report it,'' Bentsen said.
   He said his wife's position as a trustee on a mutual fund
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the
blind trust. ``No, not at all, absolutely not,'' he said.
   He said his wife was one of the directors representing the
stockholders and not the management. ``It's almost an adversarial
relationship,'' he said.
   Bush and Quayle were ebullient when they showed up for the early
morning meeting of the Republican National Committee.
   ``Now we start,'' said Bush. ``Now comes the beginning of the
end, and last night there was a shifting of the gears.'' The
nominee said that he had received a congratulatory telephone call
from President Reagan last night after accepting the GOP
presidential nomination.
   ``We are going to win this election,'' he predicted.
   Bush told the Republicans ``You have given us a tremendous
sendoff. I can't think of a better way to get out of town.''
   Republicans were generally upbeat and giving rave reviews to
Bush's big speech.
   ``He hit it. He hit it out of the park,'' exulted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato of New York. ``For me, it was (a question of) survival, the
speech of his life and he did it.'' Massachusetts delegate Joyce
Hampers called it ``a grand slam.''
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said: ``It was a sensitive speech because
he was so strong and yet so sensitive. He showed that he is attuned
to the American people. I believe he revealed a George Bush people
have not yet seen and had a chance to appreciate.''
   The GOP also got good news from the latest polls which said the
race was a dead heat after months in which Dukakis led by as much
as 17 points in most surveys.
   A CNN-USA Today poll of 1,087 registered voters Wednesday put
the race at 45 percent for Bush and Quayle to 43 percent for
Dukakis and Bentsen.
   A second CNN-USA Today poll, of 842 registered voters Thursday
night put the race at 45 for Bush-Quayle to 44 for Dukakis-Bentsen.
The spreads were within the polls' margins of error _ three points
in the first poll, four in the second.

   Burma's attorney general became its
first civilian leader in 26 years Friday and made a speech
conciliatory to students whose protests ousted his predecessor. The
students rejected him and called for a general strike.
   Maung Maung, a U.S.-educated lawyer seen as a figurehead for the
military, was appointed chairman of the Burma Socialist Program
Party in an emergency party session, and legislators of the
People's Assembly elected him president, Rangoon radio reported.
   Sein Lwin, a former general blamed for the bloody suppression of
previous student protests, stepped down as president Aug. 12 after
five days of anti-government demonstrations in which at least 95
people were killed.
   He held office for only 17 days after the resignation of Ne Win,
who had ruled since a coup in 1962 and brought economic ruin a rich
nation.
   Maung Maung told the party session, in a speech broadcast later,
that party leaders must fulfill ``the just and explicit desires of
the people'' and improve their living conditions.
   ``Simply lecturing others is not sufficient,'' he said. ``We
should also ... improve ourselves. That we should know more,
observe more, and do more is obvious from the demonstrations staged
by the innocent people.''
   He cautioned against anger and vengeance in seeking out those
responsible for riots and declared: ``We should find ways and do
everything we can to avoid similar disastrous and dangerous events
from emerging again in the future.''
   Maung Maung said it has been almost a year since Ne Win spoke of
the need for economic reform. He said some young people had been
deprived of opportunities to study and educational reform was under
way.
   Students led the mass protests that brought down Sein Lwin.
Although the government said 95 were killed and 240 wounded when
troops fired into crowds of protesters, Western diplomats said
hundreds may have died.
   ``Students have called for a nationwide strike on Monday,'' one
Western diplomat in Rangoon said by telephone. ``They're agitating
for abolition of one-party rule. The more militant leaders are
disappointed.''
   He said students passed out leaflets at a peaceful rally in
front of Rangoon General Hospital, a gathering place for
demonstrators since security forces allegedly shot doctors and
nurses there a week ago. Japan's Kyodo News Service, reporting from
Rangoon, said 15,000 people joined the rally.
   Kyodo also said about 100,000 people marched in the northern
city of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, in the second
straight day of mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Kyodo said
provincial government workers walked off their jobs to join the
demonstration. Mandalay's 1984 population was only 600,000.
   Under Ne Win, Burma was transformed from a democracy and one of
Southeast Asia's wealthiest countries to one of its poorest,
rivaled only by communist-ruled Laos and Cambodia. Rampant
inflation, food shortages and other economic hardships have fed
popular resentment and support for the student demands.
   The choice of Maung Maung surprised analysts who predicted the
new leader would come from among active and retired top military
officers who helped Ne Win take ``the Burmese way to socialism'' _
a mixture of rigid socialist economics, military control and
isolation.
   Maung Maung, 63, and Education Minister Kyaw Sein are the only
civilians in the top ranks of the military-dominated government
hierarchy.
   He has a law degree from Yale University, where he spent two
years as a visiting lecturer in the early 1960s.
   After the 1962 coup, he served as chief justice and in 1972 was
named justice minister. He was elected to the party Central
Committee in 1976, and ranked fifth in the party hierarchy. He
withdrew from the committee in 1985 for health reasons.
   Maung Maung returned to the committee after Ne Win resigned July
23, and he was named attorney general.
   Minoru Kiryu, a Burma scholar in Tokyo, said the election of
Maung Maung ``was the best possible choice for the party in its
conciliatory move to soothe the people who are demanding quick
changes and reforms.''
   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon said Maung Maunghe was ``generally
welcomed by intellectuals, while the general public, including
workers, were showing a wait-and-see attitude.''
   Brang Seng, leader of the Kachin guerrilla army and vice
president of the National Democratic Front of 10 rebel groups, told
Kyodo that the front ``will join the students and citizens fighting
in the movement for democracy to establish a provisional government
for national reconciliation.''
   ``As long as the one-party dictatorship continues we will
continue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the (next)
leader,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Just before Sein Lwin resigned, Brang Seng called for an
offensive by the rebel front, which claims to have 35,000 fighters
in its 40-year-old war for greater autonomy for ethnic minorities.
   Radio Rangoon said 52 people arrested in the rioting in Rangoon
were freed Thursday. That brought the number of people reported
freed in the capital to 155, but thousands more are believed to be
behind bars.
   Still held are several people arrested July 29-30, including the
country's leading dissident, Aung Gyi, and Sein Win, the Burma
correspondent of The Associated Press.

   Undersecretary Roland Vautour said farmers in all of the state's
83 counties have eight months in which to apply for the loans to
cover part of their actual losses.
   To be eligible, farmers must be able to repay the FmHA loans and
any other loans, must be unable to get credit elsewhere, and have
adequate security.
   Michigan is the 14th entire state designated eligible for FmHA
emergency drought loans. Others are Alabama, Delaware, Illinois,

   Iraq's proposed purchase of an idle Texas
steel plant from USX Corp. appears to raise no national security
questions, a Commerce Department official said Friday.
   ``The technology is very old, very outmoded,'' said the
official, adding that department officials ``don't anticipate any
national security issues to be involved.''
   The official spoke on condition he not be identified.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Mark Sheehan, said the
department was taking a preliminary look at whether the proposed
sale warranted an antitrust investigation.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, who strongly opposes the deal, said
Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Abdul-Amir al-Anbari, had
told him a $1 million downpayment already had been made to USX, a
Pittsburgh-based steel and energy concern.
   Fields represents a district near Houston that includes the
Baytown steel plant. He has asked President Reagan, the Justice
Department, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department to investigate
the proposed sale on grounds that it poses national security risks
and that it would unlawfully limit domestic competition.
   ``I am convinced USX is trying to keep the price of steel slab
and steel plate high,'' Fields said.
   William P. Ryder, a USX spokesman, confirmed that negotiations
to sell the steel plant to Iraq were under way, but he would not
comment on a New York Times report that Iraq was willing to pay
$100 million for the 20-year-old equipment.
   The Times report said Iraq had indicated it wanted the
steelmaking equipment to help expand production in its oil fields,
which are linked to an extensive network of pipelines.
   Efforts to reach officials at the Iraqi Embassy in Washington on
Friday were unsuccessful.
   Fields claimed two U.S. companies were ready to pay a price
comparable to the Iraqi offer. He identified them as Major
Financial Services Corp. of Tallahassee, Fla., and Birmingham Steel
Corp. of Birmingham, Ala.
   Fields said USX had ``made statements that have led me to
believe they ... really do not want to sell to an American company.
They want to remove capacity, it keeps their prices high.''
   Ryder said the company would not respond to Fields' claims.
   Fields said he was concerned that USX would be exporting ``state
of the art armorizing technology which is used for tanks and other
military applications.''
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said, ``On
the surface it is not a defense issue.''
   The plant, which once employed as many as 2,000 people, was shut
down two years ago amid labor turmoil and declining demand for
steel. It had produced up to 1.3 million tons a year of
large-diameter pipe used for U.S. oil and natural gas pipelines.
   The works includes electric furnaces for melting scrap, casters
to shape molten steel into slabs and a mill for making slabs into
oil drilling pipe.
   Fields said 750 people could be employed if the plant were
reopened.

   The usual lunch-hour rumble on the steps of the
New York Public Library was interrupted Friday by these sounds:
``Gulp. Gulp. Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.''
   And then: ``Definitely A. I like Rockland County water, but A
was better,'' said Caesar Ortonio, one of 75 people who drank five
3-ounce cups of water in a taste test to determine New York state's
finest H2O.
   The winner _ and the one selected by Ortonio _ came from the
South Huntington Water District on Long Island. The runner-up was
New York City, said Manoj Ajmera of the state Bureau of Public
Water Supply Protection.
   ``This is really to create public interest in our water
supply,'' Ajmera said before the games began. ``We've taken water
for granted for many, many years.''
   In the competition were Kingston, Millbrook, South Huntington,
New Rochelle and New York City; South Huntington and the city
advance to the next round. Missing from this regional race was
defending champion Hoosick Falls, which captured the first-ever
crown last year.

   Col. Mel Silverlake has been racing pigs
with names like ``Hambo'' and ``Magnum P.I.G.'' for three years and
has concluded the porkers are natural actors.
   ``I'm sure pigs are responsible for the phrase `he's a real
ham,' '' said Silverlake, a Medora, Ind., native and swine master
of Robinson's Racing Pigs. ``They know they're on, and they love to
entertain.''
   Silverlake, who travels the fair circuit with his wife, B.K.,
took his pigs and his makeshift track, Pork Chop Downs, to the
Indiana State Fair this week.
   ``They're not racing for the money, the flowers or the glory.
They're racing because they love it,'' said Silverlake, who
estimates he drew more than 21,000 people daily to the grandstand
at the Wisconsin State Fair in Milwaukee last week.
   Although Silverlake swears his pigs are innately competitive,
there's no doubt the troops are rallied by the 50-calorie cookie
waiting at the finish line.
   ``The pigs know the winner gets the cookie and the loser gets
the crumbs,'' says the swine impressario, decked out in red checks
and a handlebar mustache. ``That's the way it is in life, and
that's the way it is in the pig races.''

   Farmers' net cash income this year probably
will be greater than predicted a month ago despite the drought, and
it may exceed last year's record, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   ``Although some crop farmers have suffered severe losses, others
with irrigation or normal rainfall have benefited from the higher
prices,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   ``Higher feed costs and poor range and pasture conditions are
hurting livestock incomes,'' it said.
   The higher prices and reduced harvests this year will cut deeply
into U.S. farm exports in 1988-89, the report showed.
   No dollar estimates were included, but the report said the
higher prices and ``generally adequate supplies abroad'' will
likely reduce the 1988-89 volume of wheat exports by 12 percent,
corn by 4 percent and soybeans by 29 percent.
   Farmers suffering severe losses will get some relief from the
recently enacted $3.9 billion disaster assistance legislation, the
report said.
   Nationally, net cash income _ the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses _ was forecast to be in a range of $55
billion to $60 billion, compared with the record of $57.1 billion
in 1987. A month ago, the Agriculture Department's 1988 forecast
was $53 billion to $59 billion.

   Postal inspectors used a front-end loader
Friday to remove the last of some five tons of undelivered mail
found piled at and near the home of a rural mail carrier, and a
prosecutor said an indictment will be sought.
   ``I've seen this type of thing before, but never of this
magnitude,'' said postal Inspector Richard Jordan. ``Right now,
we're overwhelmed.''
   The Postal Service doesn't keep statistics on the size of such
thefts so there was no way to compare it to previous incidents,
said Dean Nichols, a postal inspector in Birmingham, Ala.
   An estimated 500,000 pieces of mail up to three years old were
discovered, said Pensacola Postmaster Ben Jasek. Most of it was
third-class bulk mail, but between 500 and 600 pieces of
first-class mail, primarily for customers who had moved and which
should have been forwarded, also were discovered. None of it
appeared to have been opened, Jordan said.
   Officials declined to release the identity of the carrier, who
worked out of a post office in Pensacola for three years but lived
in nearby Milton.
   Federal prosecutors will seek a indictment against the carrier
for obstruction of the mail, a felony with a five-year maximum
prison term, and possibly other charges, Jordan said at a news
conference.
   The carrier, who has worked for the Postal Service for 15 years,
has been placed on administrative leave without pay pending
completion of the investigation, officials said.
   ``This incident is a slap in the face to our customers, the
public,'' said Jasek, who became postmaster here only three weeks
ago. ``We are angry, dismayed and confused that one of our
co-workers could do such a thing.''
   The suspect, who is in his 50s, apparently acted alone, Jasek
said. He said the employee is unmarried but declined to answer
whether he lived alone. No motive has been established.
   Jasek said he was surprised the carrier's 500 rural customers
didn't notice their mail missing. The post office had never
received any complaints, he said.
   ``This is a fluke. All I can say is that rural carriers are kind
of their own entity,'' he said.
   The raid began Monday after a tip from a neighbor. By Thursday,
investigators said they had collected several truckloads of
magazines, catalogs, sweepstakes offers, circulars, free mail
samples and other items piled in the carrier's house, packed into a
storage shed and littering the surrounding woods.
   Jordan said more mail _ some of it three years old and badly
deteriorated _ was collected Friday.
   William Read, communications manager for the Postal Service's
New Orleans division, said the exact amount hadn't yet been
determined but that 16 hampers, each with about 260 pounds of mail,
hauled to a warehouse by Thursday was about the midpoint. The
recovered mail was trucked to a Pensacola warehouse.
   Investigators were sorting the mail and contacting each mailer
to see if they still want it delivered. Some of it will be held as
evidence and the rest will be destroyed.
   ``We hate to destroy it, but some is just undeliverable,''
Jordan said.

   By an 8-3 vote, Federal Reserve policy-makers
decided in late June to push interest rates up further in an effort
to fight inflation, according to minutes of the discussions
released Friday.
   The further credit tightening was approved with the three
dissenters complaining that they believed the central bank was
moving too quickly in its inflation-fighting efforts.
   The majority of Fed officials, however, called for the central
bank to ``increase slightly'' its restraint on the reserves held by
commerical banks. Lowering the amount of cash banks have available
to back loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans.
   Since late March, the central bank has engaged in a series of
credit tightening moves in reaction to a surprisingly strong
economy which has made job markets tighter and increased
inflationary pressures this year.
   Last week, the central bank boosted its discount rate by
one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. An increase in the
discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send
of its intention to drive interest rates higher as a way of
dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary pressures.
   The increase in the discount rate was approved on a unanimous
vote. However, back in late June, Fed policy-makers were divided on
what their next step should be.
   Board governors Wayne Angell, Martha Seger and Edward Kelley Jr.
opposed the tightening move, arguing that the Fed should wait to
see the impact of its earlier tightening efforts before going
farther.
   But the majority contended that further immediate tightening was
needed, arguing that there were ``substantial risks'' involved in
not moving forcefully to combat inflation. Some Fed members argued
for an even bolder tightening step than the one taken, arguing for
an immediate increase in the discount rate, an action the central
bank eventually took on Aug. 9.
   Fed policy-makers met again behind closed doors on Tuesday to
assess monetary policy. The minutes of that meeting will not be
released until Sept. 23. But many private economists believe the
central bank decided to continue pushing interest rates higher in
an effort to slow an economy where demand pressures are bumping up
against tight labor markets and capacity restraints.
   These analysts, however, are not looking for a further boost in
the discount rate until after Nov. 8 because of election-year
pressures.
   The Fed tightening so far has pushed up a variety of interest
rates, including banks' prime lending rate, which is now at 10
percent, the first time it has been in double-digits in three years.
   Mortgage rates have been rising as well. The Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. reported Friday that fixed-rate mortgages now stand
at 10.71 percent, up from 10.57 percent last week. Analysts are
predicting fixed-rate mortgages will soon top 11 percent.

   By an 8-3 vote, Federal Reserve policy-makers
decided in late June to push interest rates up further in an effort
to fight inflation, according to minutes of the discussions
released Friday.
   The further credit tightening was approved with the three
dissenters complaining that they believed the central bank was
moving too quickly in its inflation-fighting efforts.
   The majority of Fed officials, however, called for the central
bank to ``increase slightly'' its restraint on the reserves held by
commerical banks. Lowering the amount of cash banks have available
to back loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans.
   Since late March, the central bank has engaged in a series of
credit tightening moves in reaction to a surprisingly strong
economy which has made job markets tighter and increased
inflationary pressures this year.
   Last week, the central bank boosted its discount rate by
one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. An increase in the
discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send
of its intention to drive interest rates higher as a way of
dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary pressures.
   The increase in the discount rate was approved on a unanimous
vote. However, back in late June, Fed policy-makers were divided on
what their next step should be.
   Board governors Wayne Angell, Martha Seger and Edward Kelley Jr.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Star Foods Inc., of St. Charles, Minn.,
has issued a voluntary nationwide recall of an estimated 200,000
pounds of turkey products and ham because they are undercooked, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   If eaten, the undercooked turkey could cause salmonellosis, a
form of food poisoning, and the ham could cause trichinosis, which
can be caused by microscopic parasitic worms in infected pork.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said no illnesses have been reported.
   The recalled products include turkey bologna, oven-cooked turkey
breast, white and dark turkey rolls, cured turkey thigh meat,
cooked turkey drumstick, and cooked ham.
   These products are manufactured in bulk for slicing and are sold
in 3{- to 18-pound packages, primarily to delicatessens, hospitals,
institutions, hotels and other distributors that slice the product
before using, he said.
   The turkey products can be identified by the brand name North
Star and bear the establishment code Est. P8191 inside the USDA
inspection seal on the label.
   Also being recalled are Pioneer Brand Oven Prepared Turkey
Breast and EMGE Brand Oven Prepared Turkey Breast With Broth, which
are prepared by North Star and distributed by EMGE Packing Co.,
Inc., Fort Branch, Ind. These products also bear the establishment
code Est. P8191 inside the USDA inspection seal.
   The hams can be identified by the North Star brand name and
haave the code Est. 8191 inside the USDA seal. The hams weigh 9
pounds.
   Officials said the recall applies only to products produced
before Aug. 3. Any consumer, deli or institution holding these
products should return them to the place of purchase.
   Crawford said that consumers who have bought such products
without the original packaging from a delicatessen or other
institution should ask the seller whether the product came from
North Star Foods, Est. P8191 or 8191.
   Salmonella bacteria may be present in turkeys at the time of
slaughter, and the consumption of undercooked or underprocessed
products could cause salmonellosis. Common symptoms may include
headache, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting, Crawford
said.
   Hogs may have living trichane organisms in their muscle tissues
at the time of slaughter. And if the organisms aren't killed by
proper cooking or processing, the pork could cause trichinosis, an
``uncommon but potentially serious infection,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Police Department recalled 2,000 Smith &
Wesson .38-caliber revolvers, the newest gun used by off-duty
officers, to examine them for a possible firing defect, officials
said Friday.
   ``We found after repeated firings a problem could develop where
the hammer would freeze, rendering the gun inoperable,'' said Capt.
John C. Cerar, the head of the department's Firearms and Tactics
Section.
   The problem, which may affect 15 percent of the 60NY1-type
handguns, was discovered by department gunsmiths in late July, and
officers were ordered not to use the guns, Cerar said.
   ``In any police department it is standard procedure to issue a
notice of this type when any potential problem is encountered with
a firearm in order to avert the possibility of risk to an
officer,'' said Warren Tomek, director of quality assurance for the
Springfield, Mass., weapons manufacturer.
   Smith & Wesson said the flaw was due to an assembly problem and
estimated that less than 10 percent of the guns shipped to the
city's police departments were affected.
   Although the handgun is used as both a service and off-duty gun
in police departments throughout the country, ``the specific
problem is limited to the special design of the model 60's being
used in New York City,'' Tomek said.
   The gun used by the city's three police forces is specially
modified and is not sold on the market, Smith & Wesson said.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's ambassador to Egypt appealed for
world help Friday to fight swarms of locusts that threaten 5
million acres of farmland in his country, adding to the dangers
facing Egypt's flood-ravaged southern neighbor.
   Ambassador El-Amin Abdel-Latif said his government now was
fighting rain, floods and locusts all at once.
   Torrential rains on Aug. 4-5 that caused flooding in northern,
eastern and central Sudan killed 91 people and left more than 1.5
million homeless. More rains expected in Ethiopia, at the Nile
River source, and the approaching annual Nile flood could worsen
the disaster.
   ``The biggest worry to the government now are the locusts,''
Abdel-Latif said in pre-recorded remarks broadcast Friday on
Cairo's state-run television. He said a locust invasion put 5
million acres of cultivated land in danger of destruction,
including 200,000 acres of cotton, one of Sudan's main crops.
   ``We hope our brothers in the Arab states and in the
international community will help to overcome this,'' he said.
   Sudan's agriculture minister, El-Fateh el-Teegany, said
Wednesday that the rains and floods made for good breeding grounds
for the locusts.
   In Rome, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said Friday
it was sending thousands of tons of food to Sudan from emergency
sources of the World Food Program and asked other governments to
increase their help to Sudan.
   FAO Director General Edouard Saouma said in a statement that
following a drought and then floods, ``the Sudanese people are
faced with a life-threatening desert locust plague which could
destroy more vital food crops.''
   In Brussels, Belgium, the European Economic Community said
Friday it will provide $711,000 worth of blankets, water
purification tablets and other emergency aid to flood victims in
Sudan. It send a similar amount of assistance there earlier this
month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission charged
Friday that the giant retailer Sears Roebuck and Co. has continued
to sell lawn darts, violating its official promise to stop
marketing the hazardous game.
   The Safety Commission filed suit in federal district court in
Washington, asking that Sears be found in contempt and be ordered
to halt lawn dart sales, to survey all its stores to make sure
sales have been stopped, and to compensate the commission for its
costs in policing the agreement.
   ``I'm disappointed at Sears for this new violation but expect
this contempt action will send a strong message to Sears and other
retailers that the CPSC will enforce its regulations on lawn
darts,'' said Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon.
   Sears headquarters in Chicago said in a statement: ``We received
the motion today from the CPSC and we are in the process of
reviewing it.''
   Sears and the safety commission announced a consent agreement in
March in which the retailer said it was halting all lawn dart
sales. However, commission investigators report they later found
the darts being sold by Sears in Puerto Rico.
   The March agreement settled commission charges that Sears had
violated federal rules that ban sales of the long, metal darts in
or near toy sections of stores.
   The darts, thrown at targets on the ground in a sort of
horseshoes-like game, have been blamed on several injuries in
recent years and at least one death. Under federal rules they can
be sold only in sporting goods departments and stores.
   In its statement Friday, Sears said it learned only Thursday
that the darts were found on sale at one store in Puerto Rico last
June, ``although we had ordered this product removed from sale two
months earlier. We have made diligent efforts to assure that all of
our more than 800 retail stores have removed lawn darts from sale.''

   Moslems shouted slogans and threw stones
because officials banned their prayers Friday, fearing more riots
related to the death of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan,
officials said.
   Police fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd, said
Srinagar Divisional Commissioner Shafi Pandit, the region's top
civil administrator in the region.
   Four people were killed Thursday in riots stemming from Zia's
death the previous day. Unofficial reports and rumors circulated
that his U.S.-built C-130 airplane, which either exploded or
crashed, may have been shot down by India.
   Pakistan claims this state on India's northern tip, known as
Jammu and Kashmir, and some people in the region support the claim.
Its majority is Moslem, like Pakistan, and most of India's 800
million people are Hindus.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the subcontinent
was partitioned and became independent of Britain in 1947. Despite
its Moslem majority, Jammu and Kashmir became part of India at that
time.
   The Moslems at Friday's riot shouted anti-government slogans and
threw stones at passing vehicles after authorities banned Friday
prayers at the city's main mosque, Pandit said. He did not say how
many were in the group and said Moslems were allowed to worship at
other mosques.
   Curfews imposed on Srinagar and two other towns in Jammu and
Kashmir hours after Zia's death were lifted because of the Moslem
sabbath, Pandit said.
   Moslem demonstrators took to the streets hours after Zia's death
was announced and tried to burn Hindu houses, shops and temples,
authorities said.
   Soldiers were called out at Srinagar, the state's summer
capital, and the nearby towns of Anantnag and Baramulla.
   Four people were killed Thursday when police opened fire in
Srinagar to disperse curfew violators. At least 100 people were
injured in clashes in the city and in Baramulla and Anantnag,
police said.
   Police arrested 21 people on charges of rioting, Pandit said.
   On Friday, authorities escorted more than 2,000 foreign tourists
to Srinagar's airport, Pandit said. The travelers, mosat from the
United States, Britain and West Germany, were unable to reach the
airport earlier because of the curfew, he said.
   In London, the Foreign Office advised travelers to avoid
Srinagar.

   George Bush pulled better ratings speaking on
the final night of the Republican National Convention than
President Reagan did earlier in the week, and ABC dominated the
three-network competition.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. reported that the three networks had an
average rating of 20.9 Thursday night when Bush accepted the
party's nomination for president. That compared to a 19.9 average
Monday for Reagan's farewell to the convention.
   ABC, winning for the third night in a row, had a average rating
of 7.7, followed by NBC at 7.0 and CBS at 6.2.
   The three-network average Thursday was the best of any of the
four nights of the Republican convention, but fell well short of
the 23.3 rating for the second night of the Democratic National
Convention, when Jesse Jackson addressed that gathering in Atlanta.

   A Sikh policeman on Friday shot and
killed two senior officers who suspected he was involved in the
Sikh insurgency in Punjab state, and was shot dead himself minutes
later, authorities said.
   The policeman, Assistant Sub-Inspector Dalbir Singh, was killed
by another officer right after he fired, Deputy Inspector-General
B.S. Bhullar said.
   The shootout occurred at a police station in the town of
Patiala, 160 miles southwest of Amritsar.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, eight people were killed Thursday night in
attacks blamed on Sikh militants, news reports said.
   Bhullar said Sital Das, a senior superintendent of police, and
Baldev Singh Brar, a superintendent, were questioning Dalbir Singh
about his suspected ties with Sikh militants when he killed them
with his service revolver.
   Inspector Gurdip Singh, who was outside the room, opened the
door and shot Dalbir Singh, Bhullar said.
   Das and Brar were the two most senior police officers in Patiala
district.
   Radical Sikhs have been fighting for an independent homeland in
northern Punjab state since 1982. The community comprises only 2
percent of India's 800 million people but is in a majority in
Punjab, the country's wealthiest state.
   The insurgents claim that Sikhs are discriminated against by the
Hindus, who make up 80 percent of India's population.
   Many policemen in Punjab are Sikhs and some are known to be
sympathetic to the militants.
   The United News of India news agency said the Thursday night
victims included three Sikhs, one Hindu and four unidentified
people.
   The deaths raise to 1,729 the number of people reported killed
by Sikh militants in Punjab this year. Moderate Sikhs, accused by
militants of being traitors, make up more than half of the victims.

<TEXT>
   The head of the state board that has taken
over Yonkers' purse strings ordered the city Friday to write a plan
for phasing out services in the event a judge's fines bring on
insolvency.
   ``We need a detailed approach to how we're going to counter that
financial collapse. ... What is your (city officials') judgment on
who gets laid off first?'' said Secretary of State Gail Shaffer,
who also is chairman of the state Emergency Financial Control Board.
   On Wednesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily
extended a stay of heavy fines that a federal judge had imposed
against the city and four councilmen for refusing to approve a
housing desegregation plan.
   The appeals panel did not say when it would rule on a city
request to disallow the fines entirely. The fines double daily and
could bankrupt the city.
   Shaffer said at a news conference that as of Friday afternoon,
local banks were told not to cash any city checks, including
payroll checks, unless she had co-signed them.
   City Manager Neil DeLuca called for a meeting of the full
financial board. He complained that he was wasting time ``answering
Gail Shaffer's shenanigans'' and charged that she was engaged in a
campaign ``designed to hoodwink the media and the public.''
   ``I don't see it as a power struggle,'' responded Shaffer, who
notified the city of her decision through the news media.
   The board Shaffer heads was created in 1984 when the state
bailed out Younkers from imminent bankruptcy. It agreed earlier
this week to take over the city's finances in the wake of the
dispute over the judge's fines.
   If residents are worried about the threat of financial collapse,
Shaffer said, ``they should communicate it to the councilmen who
are defying the law ... bringing the city to its knees, fiscally.''
   In 1985, U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand ruled that Yonkers,
the state's fourth-largest city, had intentionally segregated its
housing and schools for four decades.
   The city enacted a school desegregation plan, but on Aug. 1,
four of seven City Council members refused to endorse a plan to
build moderate-income housing in largely white neighborhoods and
Sand found them and the city in contempt.
   The city is asking the appeals court to throw out the fines,
saying that Sand exceeded his authority and arguing that the city
residents should not be made to suffer because of four intransigent
council members.
   DeLuca called ``ridiculous'' Shaffer's charge that the city was
not prepared for the possibility of financial collapse.
   ``I've told employees that staff layoffs might occur real
soon,'' DeLuca said, adding that the city already has plans for
cutting all non-essential services and laying off all non-essential
employees three days before the city runs out of money. Police and
firefighters would be kept until the last possible moment.

   Police said Friday they have arrested a

$15 million in damages.
   No one was killed or injured in the fires, according to
officials.
   They said the man is 36 but did not further identify him, in
line with legal regulations, but said he always set the fires on
weekends.
   ``To us, it seems that the man had a need to fill up his
weekends with excitement,'' said police spokesman Bjoern Haneborg.
   He said the trail of arson began in the man's hometown of
Sandefjord, 50 miles south of Oslo, on May 12, 1985, and last June
13 in nearby Holemstrand the suspect is accused of setting a fire
that burned down a block of wooden houses that had been delcared a

<HEAD>Thousands Reported Slain In Ethnic Violence In Burundi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people were killed in the
central African country of Burundi this week in battles between
members of the rival Hutu and Tutsi tribes, government and
opposition officials said Friday.
   There were reports of systematic slaughter in two northern
villages and a lake filled with thousands of corpses. Several
thousand people were said to have fled the country to escape the
bloodbath.
   The government said the army had stopped the fighting between
the majority Hutu and the Tutsi, who control the military and
government.
   In April 1972 the Hutu tried to overthrow the government, but
the coup failed and the Tutsi retailiated by killing 100,000 Hutu.
   Official reports said most of the victims this week were Tutsi
but an exiled opposition group, the Hutu People Liberation Party,
accused the army of massacring Hutus.
   ``There are thousands of Hutus corpses, the victims of Tutsi
soldiers, floating in Lake Tanganyika,'' the opposition group said.
Neither claim could be confirmed independently.
   More than 7,000 Burudians were reported to have fled to
neighboring Rwanda. Sources in Rwanda, including diplomats, said
the refugees included members of both the Tutsi and Hutu tribes,
and both sides reported thousands of deaths.
   Fighting began Sunday near the northern villages of Marangara
and Ntega, the government radio reported Friday.
   ``Some inhabitants of northern Burundi belonging to the minority
Tutsi tribe were killed in a selective manner,'' it Foreign
Minister Cyprien Mbonimpa as saying.
   Although the violence was confined to a section of the north,
the government imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and prohibited
meetings of more than five people without government permission.
   The emergency order was signed by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi
who took power in a bloodless coup last September.
   ``We suspect that some former Hutu refugees infiltrated the
country from some foreign countries. They incited the Hutu and
called on them to massacre the Tutsi population,'' Astere
Nzisabira, Burundi's ambassador to Belguim, said in a radio
interview Thursday in Brussels.
   Authorities intervened ``in a peaceful manner'' after the first
day of violence, ``but the following day the murders resumed in
full swing,'' he said. ``At that stage, the army had to intervene
and restore peace to the country.'' He had no specific death toll,
but said the numbers were much higher than the initial estimates of
300-400 dead.
   Also Friday, Radio Kigali, the Rwandan government radio, said
its government was trying to provide food and shelter for the
influx of Burundians.
   Burundi, with nearly 5 million people in an area about the size
of Maryland, is one of Africa's most densely populated countries.
About 85 percent of its people belong to the Hutu tribe and the
rest are Tutsis.
   Ethnic struggles have plagued Burundi since independence from
Belguim in 1962. For generations, the tall, lanky Tutsi held the
short, stocky Hutu in feudal serfdom.
   In 1976, Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza mounted a bloodless coup that
ousted Michel Micombero, who had sanctioned the Hutu slaughter four
years earlier. Bagaza, like Micombero, was a Tutsi.
   Bagaza was overthrown Sept. 4, by Buyoya, who pledged to resolve
ethnic differences.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano
on Friday criticized the news media's handling of the hostage
ordeal in West Germany.
   The bloody three-day drama ended Thursday with three people
dead. Gunmen who hijacked a public bus after robbing a bank on
Tuesday used the media to convey their demands to police and to
keep their hostages before the public.
   ``The mad trip of the robbers ... has dragged with it the sad
image of (the robbers') free use of the media,'' the front-page
editorial said.
   It praised the courage of Emanuele de Giorgi, a 15-year-old
Italian boy shot to death by the robber as he tried to protect his
younger sister.

<HEAD>PLO Leader Talks Of Forming Palestinian Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior PLO leader said Friday that Egypt
had agreed to help persuade the United States not to veto plans for
a Palestinian provisional government in the U.N. security council.
   Egypt provided no confirmation of any such agreement.
   The official, Hani el-Hassan, also said in recorded remarks on
Egypt's state-run television that it would take years for the
Palestinian plans to materialize.
   Hassan, a political adviser to Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat, declared, ``When we (the PLO) announce a
state and a government, it doesn't mean we will see a result in one
or two weeks.
   ``We are talking about a stage that will bear fruit in the early
1990s, in three or four years.''
   Hassan was part of a three-man PLO delegation that left Egypt on
Thursday after four days of talks with President Hosni Mubarak and
other officials.
   He said on the weekly pre-recorded program ``Brotherly
Meetings'' that the PLO expects the United States to use its veto
power at the Security Council to block acceptance of a Palestinian
provisional government.
   Hassan said he discussed this with Mubarak and that the
president said he was ready to ``pressure the United States'' into
accepting the proposal.
   While Egypt did not confirm this, Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said at the end of the meetings that Egypt would put
all its resources behind the PLO.
   PLO delegation member Mahmoud Abbas said Mubarak agreed the PLO
should establish a provisional government with an internationally
acceptable political agenda.
   Washington refuses to negotiate with the PLO unless it
recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism. A U.S. veto could end a
PLO effort to win U.N. recognition of any government it might form.
   Hassan said he also believed that Saudi Arabia and Iraq stood
ready to pressure Washington to forgo a veto.
   The PLO is debating proposals designed to fill the vacuum left
by Jordan, which announced this month it was disengaging from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and inviting the PLO to assume control
there.
   Jordan had maintained administrative and political links with
the neighboring territory it controlled before Israel seized the
area in the 1967 Middle East war.
   PLO proposals include declaring a state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, a region bordering Egypt which the Israelis also
occupy. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the occupied
territories, where a Palestinian uprising has been going on since
December.
   PLO officials have also talked about setting up a
government-in-exile or a provisional government headed by PLO
leaders. They gave few details on how these proposals would differ.
   Hassan made clear in the TV interview that the choice most
favored was a provisional government. However, he said all
proposals would be submitted for approval to the Palestine Natonal
Council, the PLO's legislative arm that functions as a
parliament-in-exile. The body is to meet in Algeria next month.
   The PLO leader also repeated earlier PLO statements that a
provisional government would recognize Israel in exchange for
Israel's recognition of a Palestinian state in the occupied
territories.

<HEAD>Trucks With Defective Steering Gears Are Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 22,000 heavy trucks are being
ordered off the highways because of potential defects in their
power steering gears that could result in ``sudden and catastrophic
failure,'' the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said
Friday.
   The TRW Ross Gear division, which produced the steering gears,
and manufacturers of Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Western
Star and White GMC trucks, urged that affected trucks be removed
from highways immediately and towed to the nearest truck dealer,
the agency said.
   The recall affects 22,687 trucks carrying certain steering gears
manufactured by TRW Ross Gear division since last March. The safety
agency said TRW has confirmed seven incidents of steering gear
failure since June.
   An agency statement said failure of a defective part in the
steering mechanism could cause the steering to lock, resulting in
loss of steering control.
   TRW says about 27,000 potentially defective units have been
manufactured but not all have been installed in trucks, the agency
said.
   The recall involves 8,319 Freightliner trucks, 5,100 Kenworth
trucks, 4,506 White GMC trucks, 4,500 Peterbilt trucks and 262
Western Star trucks, the agency said.
   It said the suspect equipment includes certain TRW Ross Gear
division TAS-65 truck steering gears sold for production and a
limited number of TAS-65, TAS-40 and TAS-55 gears sold as
prototypes. The TAS-65 gears have date codes of 085-88 or higher
and were shipped after March 24.

<HEAD>70 Percent of Britons Polled Favor Woman Priests, Bishops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Gallup poll published Friday reports that 70
percent of Britons surveyed think the Church of England should
accept women as priests and even consecrate them as bishops.
   An even higher percentage of Church of England members in the
poll, 75 percent, supported the idea, it said.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Church of England, has warned that the issue could split not just
Britain's state church, but Anglican churches worldwide.
   The poll, published Friday in London's Daily Telegraph
newspaper, was based on interviews with 1,021 Britons this month.
   The Church of England has an all-male priesthood. In the last 11
years, a minority of the 26 self-governing Anglican churches in
other countries, including the 2.5-million member U.S. Episcopal
Church, have ordained more than 1,000 women as priests. The U.S.
church and those in Canada and New Zealand are considering
consecrating the first women bishops this year.
   Results of the Gallup survey contrasted with a close vote on the
women's role issue at the church's General Synod on July 5.
   The synod voted 299-216 to draft legislation allowing ordination
of women. The breakdown of votes was bishops 28-21, clergy 137-102,
and laity 134-93 with one abstention.
   The draft legislation must be debated and voted upon by all 44
of the state church's dioceses. It will then go back to the synod
for final approval and must then be passed by Parliament to become
law. The first woman could be ordained in 1992 or 1993.
   Asked if they thought the Church of England should accept women
as priests and bishops, 70 percent of the Britons polled agreed
that it should, 18 percent disagreed and 12 percent were undecided.
   The group included Anglicans, people of other faiths and
non-church goers. The response to the same question among only
Anglicans in the 1,021 people surveyed was 75 percent agreeing, 16
percent disagreeing and nine percent undecided.
   The paper did not indicate how many of the 1,021 were Anglicans
and gave no margin of error.
   On Aug. 1, the world's Anglican bishops, who represent 70
million faithful in 164 countries, voted 423-28 for a carefully
worded compromise on the issue. It was designed to keep their
churches together despite the deep divisions.
   Their compromise called for the churches to respect each other's
decisions, but it did not take a definitive stand on the issue.

   The federal government offered its
elite anti-terrorist force to stop a 54-hour cross-country hostage
ordeal in which three people were killed, a spokesman said Friday,
but state officials chose another plan.
   The revelation came as criticism heightened of state officials'
handling of the terror spree by two bank robbers and a woman
accomplice.
   The incident ended Thursday in a gunfight with police on a
superhighway near Bonn that killed a hostage.
   Killed earlier were a 15-year-old Italian boy hostage, shot by
the criminals at a highway rest area, and a police officer who
perished in a car crash while pursuing the bandits.
   Michael Butz, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry, told
reporters the GSG-9 anti-terrorist force was offered to North
Rhine-Westphalia state officials.
   Instead, the state officials assigned a police commando unit to
stop the robbers. The commandos rammed the getaway car and in an
ensuing gun battle, one of the hostages inside the car, 18-year-old
Silke Bischof, was killed.
   State officials said Friday they were sure she was killed by one
of the two bank robbers _ identified as Dieter Degowski and
Hans-Juergen Roesner _ and not by police gunfire.
   Asked about the state's decision not to use the GSG-9, Butz
replied only: ``The legal situation in which the states have
responsibility for police deployments must be respected.''
   At a preliminatry court hearing Friday night, Degowski admitted
that he fatally shot the Italian boy, according to the Cologne
radio station Rundfunk. It quoted a court official, who was not
identified, and gave no further details.
   Federal Education Minister Juergen Moellemann was among the
politicians who criticized North Rhine-Westphalia officials for not
making use of the GSG-9.
   The initials stand for Grenzschutzgruppe-Unit 9, or Federal
Border Guard Troops-Unit 9, which gained fame by rescuing 86
passengers held by terrorists on a Lufthansa airliner on Oct. 13,
1977 at Mogadishu, Somalia.
   Moellemann said the North Rhine-Westphalia state's interior
minister, Herbert Schnoor, and the interior minister for the
city-state of Bremen, Bernd Meyer, should resign.
   ``It is totally unconceivable why actions were not taken
sooner,'' Moellemann told the Bild newspaper. ``There were plenty
of opportunities to do so.''
   The ordeal began Tuesday morning, when two men robbed a bank in
the northwestern town of Gladbeck, escalated on Wednesday with the
seizure of a Bremen bus with 30 people on board, and ended Thursday
with the shootout.
   Most of the ordeal occurred in the city-state of Bremen and
North Rhine-Westphalia, but the gunmen also drove the bus across
the border into the Netherlands, then returned to West Germany.
   Schnoor said he took ``political responsibility'' for the
handling of the situation by North Rhine-Westphalia law officials
and he rejected allegations they bungled the job.
   He said on West German radio: ``It is impossible to foresee what
will be the end result before all the cards have been put on the
table.''
   Meyer spokesman Volker Backhaus also defended Bremen officials'
handling of the situation.
   ``There were times when Roesner and his female friend were
outside the bus giving interviews to reporters, but the other
gunman was inside the bus threatening the hostages,'' he said.
   Reinhard Schmidt-Kuentzel, a spokesman for the North
Rhine-Westphalia Interior Ministry, said that in the final
shootout, Miss Bischof was shot in the heart; a second woman
hostage was grazed by a bullet on the back; Roesner was shot in the
thigh, and Degowski and a female accomplice, Marion Irma Loeblich,
were unhurt.

   Sen. Dan Quayle insisted Friday that he
broke no rules to get into the Indiana National Guard during the
Vietnam War, but acknowledged that a family friend probably made
calls on his behalf after Quayle expressed interest.
   ``I got in fairly,'' the Republican vice presidential nominee
insisted at an outdoor news conference after a rousing rally in his
home town.
   A crowd of thousands that heard the questions over a public
address system jeered reporters and chanted ``Quayle! Quayle!'' in
support of the senator's responses.
   The 41-year-old Quayle had refused throughout the week to answer
media questions about whether strings were pulled to get him into
the Guard and avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.
   Friday's news conference was his first accounting of the chain
of events leading to his enrollment in the Guard. He portrayed it
as a normal occurance given his relationship with his family and
their friends.
   ``I did not ask anyone to break the rules, and so far as I know
no one did,'' Quayle said
   The Indianapolis News had reported Thursday that Wendell C.
Phillippi, former managing editor of the newspaper, which is part
of Quayle's grandfather's publishing chain, had called the Guard on
Quayle's behalf. Phillippi was a former commander of the state
National Guard and a family friend.
   ``Wendell Phillippi knew that I wanted to get into the National
Guard and I hope that he helped me and I think he did,'' Quayle
told reporters. ``I would hope that he helped me and I expect
that.''
   Quayle said he initially called his parents to discuss his
desire to enter the National Guard as a senior in college. He faced
the loss of his colleage student deferment upon graduation.
   Asked why he did not just go down and fill out papers if his
entry into the Guard was as routine as he suggested it was, Quayle
said:
   ``I do what any normal person would do at that age. You call
home. You call home to mother and father and say `I'd like to get
in the National Guard.'''
   He said his conversation with Phillippi was brief and that he
did not ask Phillipi to make any calls on his behalf. ``I told him
I wanted to get into the National Guard. I would assume calls would
be made. I talked to Mr. Phillippi very briefly. I hope that he
helped me and I think he did.''
   Quayle said he saw nothing wrong with that and added that he
resented questions implying that joining the Guard was less of a
military service to his country.
   ``The implication is somehow that Dan Quale, by voluntarily
signing up for the Indiana National Guard was somehow not patriotic
and I resent that,'' he said.
   Asked to assess the way he proceeded as a 22-year-old, he said,
``I would not have done anything differently'' if he had known he
would be running for vice president one day.
   Questions about the circumstances surrounding Quayle's
enlistment in the National Guard in 1969 continued to overshadow
George Bush's presidential campaign and dog Quayle just a day after
he was nominated for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Quayle said he did not offer to have Bush withdraw his name for
the vice presidential spot on the ticket, saying he did not think
there was any reason for that.
   Bush and Quayle had just concluded their first joint campaign
rally on the front steps of the courthouse when the vice president
walked away and Quayle approached reporters standing behind a rope
line.
   Quayle took a combative, hard line, with reporters, during an
extraordinary 20-minute impromptu news conference on the courthouse
lawn.
   The give-and-take was broadcast to people at the rally site with
an amplifier system, and Quayle supporters cheered his answers and
booed reporters seeking to question his military past. At one
point, the crowd started chanting ``Boring! Boring!''
   Quayle said he planned to make his military records available,
but didn't say when. He also said he did not believe he deceived
Bush campaign organization officials when questioned about this
during the screening process that preceded his selection for the
ticket.
   A high-ranking campaign official insisted to reporters that the
unusual news conference was ``not a set-up.'' He said the session
was amplified to the crowd because there were several reporters on
a separate platform who otherwise could not hear Quayle.
   Quayle, who said he had reservations about the Vietnam war, as
many people in his generation did, said he ``could have been called
to Vietnam as many Indiana units were, and if I had been called, I
would have gone.''
   ``No, I did not join to avoid service in Vietnam,'' he said.
Quayle said it was perfectly normal for a young man of 22 to talk
to talk about joining the Guard, or making any other decision.
   Asked if the uproar over his military background would harm the
prospects for the Bush ticket, Quayle said he thought it would do
the opposite, saying millions of people who have served in the
National Guard are offended by suggestions that he joined to avoid
duty in Vietnam.
   Quayle said he did not know whether there were any vacancies in
the Guard at the time he sought to join.
   During a joint appearance with Bush earlier Friday in New
Orleans, before members of the Republican National Committee,
Quayle said he had learned something about how to conduct himself
in that convention city. Then, he snapped his heels together, and
came to attention, and did a military precision-style delivery of
name, rank and serial number.

<TEXT>
   The sister of American hostage Terry
Anderson said in a statement published Friday that his kidnappers
were unjust in insisting that he will be released only when peace
comes to Lebanon.
   In a related development, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa said
British hostages probably will be released soon, but that the
release of German and U.S. hostages will take more time.
   ``In the past 3{ years, I have tried my very best to pressure my
government to negotiate for Terry's release and the release of the
other hostages,'' Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said in her message.
   ``You have now presented new demands which are impossible for me
to put forth to my government,'' wrote Mrs. Say, who lives in
Kentucky.
   The text of the message was published by Beirut's two leading
daily newspapers, An-Nahar and As-Safir.
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and
believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which holds
Anderson, 40, and American hostage Thomas Sutherland, 56, released
a statement Thursday that set four demands for their release.
   Two of the demands were new: the unconditional withdrawal of all
Israeli forces and their Christian militia allies from south
Lebanon and U.S. aid for the reconstruction of war-ravaged south
Lebanon and Beirut.
   The group also demanded the release of all Lebanese and
Palestinian Mujahedeen, or holy warriors, from prisons in Christian
east Beirut as well as in Israel and its self-designated security
zone.
   Israel and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army control a
10-mile-deep enclave in south Lebanon to prevent cross-border
guerrilla forays.
   Unlike many of its previous communications, the Shiite Moslem
faction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspects
held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.
   ``I think it is grossly unjust for you to hold Terry Anderson
for ransom that includes what amounts to a complete peace
settlement in the entire region and the end of centuries-old
hostilities,'' Mrs. Say stated.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley reiterated U.S. policy against making deals for hostages.
``We believe that arrangements that reward hostage takers only
encourage more terrorism,'' she said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, was grabbed June
9, 1985.
   An anonymous caller on Wednesday claimed Islamic Jihad was also
holding Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 48, who disappeared Jan.
20, 1987, while in Beirut to negotiate with the group on releasing
the American hostages. There was no way to verify the claim.
   Ash-Shiraa, quoting an unidentified west Beirut leader involved
in ``contacts under way to free foreign hostages in Lebanon,'' said
these ``contacts have made much progress.''
   It said two sets of negotiations were being carried on
separately: ``the first involving the release of ... Waite and two
British hostages, the second concerning the release of West German
captive Rudolf Cordes and the ... American hostages.''
   It said the case of the British hostages was ``cooking on a high
burner, while the affair of Cordes and the American hostages is
cooking on a slow burner.''
   The report in Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of U.S. secret
arms sale to Iran in November 1986, could not be independently
verified. The magazine's previous stories about the hostages have
not proved accurate.
   Cordes, 53, Beirut manager for Hoechst AG, one of West Germany's
largest chemical companies, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987. The
pro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed his abduction.
   Ash-Shiraa said the kidnappers were seeking a huge sum of money
to be paid to them, and ``and at the same time economic, military
and political conditions set by Iran would be met.'' It did not
elaborate.
   In addition to Waite, Britain seeks the release of journalist
John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual
British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the
Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   British government sources in London said Friday that the first
British diplomat sent to Iran for a year has not been allowed to
visit two Britons jailed without trial.
   Earlier, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported that diplomat
David Reddaway's mission has ``run into trouble.''
   Reddaway went to Iran soon after the Church of England held
talks with an Iranian envoy over the British hostages in Lebanon.
The talks and the Reddaway mission raised hopes that the hostages
might be released.
   British government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they were disappointed by Iran's continued refusal to allow
Reddaway to see businessman Roger Cooper, who has been in prison in
Iran nearly three years, and tourist Nicholas Nicola.

   A Japanese man arrested on explosives
charges and linked by investigators to a left-wing terrorist group
pleaded innocent Friday to a revised indictment.
   Yu Kikumura, 36, was arrested April 12 at a rest stop on the New
Jersey Turnpike after a state police trooper found three homemade
bombs in his car.
   After his arrest, U.S. authorities linked Kikumura to the
terrorist Japanese Red Army.
   Kikumura is accused of transporting explosives interstate
without a permit, transporting explosives interstate by an illegal
alien, possession of an unregistered firearm, using a false
passport and other charges. He could face 100 years in prison if
convicted on all counts.
   Defense attorney Ronald Kuby filed two motions with U.S.
District Judge Alfred J. Lechner asking that the charges be
dismissed.
   Kuby argued that prosecutors obtained the new indictment ``to
avoid the certain dismissal of at least four charges'' in the
original indictment.
   ``To all appearances, the government's action certainly seemed
designed to punish a pesky defendant for exercising his legal
rights,'' he contended.
   Lechner set a Sept. 9 date for arguing the motions. He also set
a trial date of Sept. 27.
   Kikumura was led into the courtroom under heavy security,
handcuffed and in leg irons, prompting a protest from defense
attorney Ronald Kuby. Lechner agreed to allow the leg irons to be
taken off, but Kikumura remained handcuffed throughout the
25-minute hearing.

   About 1,200 dockworkers stayed off the job
Friday in protest of Pacific Maritime's decision to hire non-union
workers for clerical positions at California ports.
   The workers planned to return Saturday.
   The dispute concerns 30 of 60 marine clerk positions that are
being made available to ``young college kids'' instead of
longshoremen with 20 years of experience, said Tom Lupher,
president of Local 10 of the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union.
   ``What really gripes us is that some of them are children of the
employers,'' Lupher said. The decision to hire non-union marine
clerks was made without consulting the union.
   Local 10 represents 1,400 dockworkers.
   The Pacific Maritime Association, a collective bargaining group
for commercial shipping companies, said it was working to end the
dispute.
   ``Local 10 is engaged in an illegal work stoppage in violation
of the `no-strike' clause of the collective bargaining agreement
between the (union) and the Pacific Maritime Association,'' the
group said in a prepared statement. ``On behalf of its 120 member
companies, the PMA is pursuing available remedies to end the work
stoppage.''
   Although a specific time has not been set, the union is planning
a referendum on the matter.
   The clerical workers earn $20,000 to $25,000 a year more than
regular longshoremen, with many earning as much as $60,000 to
$70,000 a year, Lupher said.

<HEAD>Front Brings Storms; North Carolina Sizzles But Other Places Get
Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A stationary front brought storms to parts of the Midwest and
East on Friday, and much of the northeast quarter of the nation got
a respite from high heat, but temperature records continued to fall
in North Carolina.
   The front, which extended from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the
mid-Atlantic Coast states, had temperatures to the north of it in
the 70s and temperatures to the south largely in the 90s.
   Some of the thunderstorms that developed along the front
produced heavy rainfall. Blinding rain was reported falling at
Prairie City, Ind., the National Weather Service said.
   Strong thunderstorms brought high winds, brief heavy rains and
small hail to the Virginias on Friday morning. Thunderstorm winds
blew down trees and power lines in a wooded area near Foster, Va.,
and trees were toppled by damaging winds in Tucker County, W.Va.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were reported in the lower
Mississippi Valley, the southern Plains, the Gulf Coast and
Florida. Thunderstorm winds gusted to 75 mph in parts of Pittsburg
County in southeastern Oklahoma.
   North of the stationary front, temperatures were in the 70s in
the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and the northern
Atlantic Coast states.
   Records were broken Friday in Charlotte, N.C., where the
temperature reached 100 degrees, breaking a record of 98 degrees,
and at Raleigh, where the 103 reading broke the record of 96. Both
old records were set in 1983.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.20 inches at Evansville, Ind.; 0.47 inch at Bowling
Green, Ky., and West Plains, Mo.; and 0.45 inch at Jacksonville,
Ark.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 102 degrees at Needles, Calif.,
Fayetteville, N.C., Goldsboro, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C. The
early-morning low for the nation was 35 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Saturday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the lower Mississippi Valley, the eastern and
central Gulf Coast, the Tennessee Valley, the southern Ohio Valley,
and the middle and southern Atlantic Coast states, Arizona, and the
front range of the Rockies in Colorado and New Mexico.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were forecast for parts of the Pacific
Northwest and the California coast as well as across the Great
Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley, Pennsylvania and New England; between
100 and 110 in the desert Southwest and valleys of California; and
in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest of the nation.

   Five people whose bodies were found in their
sweltering homes or in a car were believed to have died from the
heat, the Marion County coroner's office said Friday.
   The five, whose ages ranged from 52 to 82, were all found
Thursday, but authorities believe some of them died earlier in the
week.
   The temperature in Indianapolis reached 102 on Tuesday and
continued well into the 90s through Thursday, but the heat wave
eased Friday.
   The latest victim, Harriet Thornburg, 78, was found dead in her
apartment Thursday evening after an apartment manager called
authorities.
   Also Thursday, the bodies of Pauline H. Felton, 82, and her
niece, Georgia Jones, 69, were found in the two-story house they
shared. All doors and windows in the house were closed. An electric
fan was plugged in but was not operating.
   ``It is extremely hot in there,'' said Gary Gray, a Marion
County deputy coroner. He said the women probably had been dead
since Tuesday.
   Two other people whose bodies were discovered Thursday had
unusually high body temperatures, but autopsies had not been
completed, said chief deputy coroner Charles Green.
   The body of Adam Stevens, 52, was found on the front seat of a
car. Authorities said the car did not belong to Stevens, who may
have been using it as a place to sleep.
   Merle Smith, 82, was found dead on the floor of her residence.

   Politicians and celebrities will break
bread with farm labor leader Cesar Chavez on Sunday to celebrate
the end of his 36-day fast against pesticides on table grapes, a
union spokeswoman said Friday.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, actors Martin Sheen, Robert Blake,
Edward James Olmos and others will attend the outdoor Mass at the
United Farm Workers' compound in Delano, about 150 miles north of
Los Angeles, said Lorena Parlee.
   Also planning to attend is Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II.
His father, the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy broke bread with Chavez
at Delano in 1968 to conclude a 25-day fast.
   Meanwhile, doctors Friday stepped up monitoring of Chavez on the
34th day of his water-only fast. Dr. Fidel Huerta said Thursday
that he feared Chavez might not be able to sustain the fast until
Sunday.
   Another physician, Marion Moses, who attended Chavez during the
1968 fast, will remain with him until he breaks this fast which
began July 17, Ms. Parlee said.
   Chavez had lost 31 pounds, she added. During the first weeks of
the fast, Chavez attended Mass nightly but hasn't appeared in
public since Aug. 11.
   ``To us, what he is going through is extremely painful for all
of us,'' said the UFW's first vice president, Dolores Huerta, who
is the doctor's mother.
   ``It's very hard on everyone because we all love Cesar and
respect him very much,'' she said. ``It makes us more determined to
work harder and do more than in the past to end the problem with
pesticides.''
   In Malibu, Sheen and a dozen protesters chanting ``boycott
grapes'' demonstrated Friday in front of a supermarket in support
of Chavez's claims that table grapes contain dangerous pesticides.
   Sheen, actor Max Gail and others marched a half-mile from
Sheen's home to a market, bearing banners reading ``Boycott
Grapes'' and ``Stop Toxic Death,'' and urging people not to shop
there.
   ``There is something seriously wrong,'' Sheen said. ``The bottom
line is the Earth can live without us but we cannot live without
the Earth.''
   The union charges five pesticides _ Captan, Dinoseb, methyl
bromide, Parathion and Phosdrin _ should be banned because its
studies say the chemicals cause cancer.
   The state Department of Food and Agriculture, as well as several
growers groups, dispute the union's claims and cite existing laws
aimed at protecting farm workers and consumers.

<HEAD>ABC Poll: Guard Controversy Should Not Be Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans believe that Dan Quayle's service
in the National Guard should not be a campaign issue, but voters
are split on whether it should be an issue if it turns out he used
family influence to get into the Guard, a poll released Friday said.
   The ABC News poll found in a random sample of 613 registered
voters Thursday night that 63 percent said the fact that the GOP
vice presidential candidate entered the National Guard at a time
when others faced possible service in Vietnam should not be a
campaign issue.
   About 23 percent said they thought it should be a minor issue
and 11 percent thought it should be a major issue, according to the
poll, which had an margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
   But if influence was used, 23 percent said Quayle's National
Guard service should be a major issue and 27 percent said it should
be a minor issue, while 47 percent said it should not be a campaign
issue.
   Seventy-four percent said Quayle's decision to join the National
Guard will have no effect on how they vote; 17 percent said they
are now less likely to vote Republican and 4 percent are more
likely to vote for the GOP ticket.
   But if Quayle got into the National Guard because of outside
influence, the number of those who would be less likely to vote for
George Bush and Quayle jumps to 31 percent, the poll found.
   Nearly three-quarters of those who say they are less likely to
vote for Bush if influence was used were probably going to vote for
the Democratic ticket anyway, the poll said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Identifies Mystery Student Who Advertised Kidney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student who anonymously offered to sell
one of his kidneys to pay for his education was identified Friday
as an impoverished 22-year-old who was expelled from school because
of a $139 debt.
   The Daily Nation identified the student as Felix Abwora, whose
heart-rending plea received worldwide attention after his letter
was published in the Aug. 13 edition of the newspaper.
   ``I am a needy student from a poor family facing expulsion from
school for lack of school fees,'' the student wrote. ``My parents
are unable to meet the basic needs of our family as well as the
ever-increasing cost of my education since they are landless and
jobless.
   ``Since my efforts to get financial assistance for studies have
been unsuccessful, I now offer to sell one of my kidneys at a cheap
price, to whoever has kidney problems and may want to have a kidney
transplant.''
   Abwora signed the letter ``F.A. Fuko,'' a pseudonym made up of
his initials and the word for kidney in his Luhya tribal language.
The letter, dated July 28, gave no other details.
   The story was carried by international news agencies and
prompted worldwide offers of help for ``Fuko,'' who said he lived
in the small western Kenya town of Hakati.
   The Daily Nation said it was able to trace Abwora and to confirm
his story.
   ``The case of Abwora is very much genuine and his request is
highly recommended,'' area chief Bernard Ojiambo told the Daily
Nation. The chief said he had tried to organize a fund-raiser for
Abwora's education, but had no success.
   Until April, Abwora was a high school student at Makunde
Secondary School. But he said he was expelled when he fell behind
in his school fees by 2,500 Kenya shillings, or $139.
   Kenyan students frequently are in their 20s by the time they
finish high school because they often must skip several years for
lack of money.
   Abwora is one of seven children and one of his brothers, Nagila,
19, also has dropped out of school because he could not pay a $12
building fee, the Daily Nation said.
   The family lives on a four-acre homestead, but the newspaper
didn't say whether it was the family's property.

   A man who may have been suffering
from diabetic shock drove a van more than two miles along Atlantic
City's Boardwalk on Friday, scattering tourists and injuring two
pedestrians, police said.
   The van, traveling nearly 30 mph, went more than 35 blocks
before heading down a staircase, where police cars stopped the
driver, said Atlantic City Patrolman Kirk Sutton Sr.
   Police had tried to stop the van three times.
   The driver, Adam R. Bailey, 27, of Sicklerville, is a diabetic,
police said.
   ``I talked to his wife and supervisor and they both stated that
he's not a habitual drug user or anything like that,'' Sutton said.
``They're church-going people, and his wife thinks he may have been
in diabetic shock.''
   The van first struck Juanita Sarmiento, 66, of New York City,
who suffered bruises, the patrolman said. It then struck Anne Marie
Kotlowski, 52, of North Arlington, who was dragged several feet,
Sutton said. She suffered two fractured legs, a possible fractured
hip and skull and lacerations on her forehead, he said.
   Both women were in stable condition at the Atlantic City Medical
Center.
   Bailey was treated for a head injury.
   He was charged with failing to comply with officers' signals,
resisting arrest, eluding police, illegally operating a vehicle on
the Boardwalk, reckless driving and excessive speed, Sutton said.
   Bailey was being held in the Atlantic City Jail on $7,500 bail,
Sutton said.
   Official vehicles that ordinarily travel along the Boardwalk
must follow a 5 mph speed limit, Sutton said.

<HEAD>Texas Air Chief Defends Eastern Layoffs, Service Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday
defended a decision by the company's subsidiary, Eastern Airlines,
to lay off 4,000 employees and cut service as a way to ``stabilize
the company'' by cutting losses.
   Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on
Eastern's plans to eliminate service to 14 cities, said the layoffs
and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially
troubled carrier.
   ``If Eastern's management is not permitted to take the actions
to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,'' Lorenzo
said, rejecting suggestions by union attorneys that he was trying
to bust organized labor at Eastern by transferring the carrier's
assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property.
   Three labor unions that represent Eastern employees have
challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order
that bars the airline from making layoffs.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on
the union's bid for a permanent injunction.
   Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to
stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.''
   Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract
negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line
Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers.
   Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge
Eastern's operations into Continental.
   Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to
give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased
Eastern.
   The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air
leverage over the unions. ``Eastern's airplanes can be repainted
and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union
pilots,'' the speech draft said.
   But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking
firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered
that portion of the speech.

   A judge who killed himself in a deserted
courthouse hallway after he learned details were being published
about his alleged sexual misconduct felt hounded by the press and
unable to bear it anymore, a friend said.
   King County Superior Court Judge Gary M. Little was found dead
Thursday night of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,
officials said.
   He left a note saying: ``I have chosen to take my life. It's an
appropriate end to the present situation.''
   In the past six years, Little has been officially criticized or
disciplined over improper contacts with juvenile defendants.
   But rumors persisted of more serious sexual misconduct, leading
a political challenger to raise those contacts as a campaign issue
this year and reporters from several news organizations to pursue
reports Little had used his influence to coerce young men into sex.
   Little, 49, a judge since 1980, announced last month that he
would not seek a third term, acknowledging that innuendo about his
work with teen-age boys was the reason. He said he planned to move
to California and work outside law.
   Little, whose father committed suicide when he was 8, shot
himself about an hour before the presses at the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer started printing Friday's editions, which
contained more than three full pages outlining allegations by five
men _ three of them former students of Little's _ that he had
coerced them into having sex with him.
   The Seattle Times also reported Friday that it had been
investigating Little, and had interviewed more than 80 people.
   ``He said he felt he'd been hounded by the press and he just
couldn't take it anymore,'' said attorney Camden Hall, a friend of
Little who spoke to him by telephone just minutes before the judge
died. ``It was too much pressure. The hounding wouldn't stop.''
   ``He was not only driven into disgrace but to death,'' said Hal
Foster, an art history professor and author who was interviewed
from Paris by telephone by the Times.
   Foster took Little's law class at private Lakeside School in the
1970s and said there was no sexual contact involving him and that
he wasn't aware of any with his classmates.
   ``He was tried out of court on suspicions about his sexuality.
That, to me, is reactionary. It's scary,'' Foster said.
   Post-Intelligencer Executive Editor J.D. Alexander said in a
news release that Little's death ``is a tragedy that touches the
community at several levels. Certainly the most tragic is the loss
of a human life.''
   The newspaper's investigation was warranted, the statement said,
because of a ``conspiracy of silence'' in ``key levels of the
community'' about Little's behavior.
   ``There was no indication of relief; no indication that the
system that had failed these victims would or could serve the
public any better in the future,'' the statement said.
   A janitor found Little's body. A .38-caliber pistol and a note
were found with the body, said Vaughn Van Zant, an investigator
with the King County medical examiner.
   The one-page, handwritten note, addressed to no specific
individual, was found on a hallway bench, Van Zant said. The
medical examiner would not release its contents, but the Times
reported the note said:
   ``I have chosen to take my life. It's an appropriate end to the
present situation. I had hoped that my decision to withdraw from
the election and leave public life would have closed the matter.
Apparently these steps are not satisfactory to those who feel more
is required, so be it. I will say one final time that I am proud of
my efforts and accomplishments as a Superior Court Judge. I am
deeply appreciative of those who have wished me well these past few
weeks.''
   The judge was disciplined twice concerning improper contacts he
had with youths who appeared before him in court.
   In April 1985, after a complaint, Little was barred from the
juvenile court bench by the presiding judge and the Superior Court
executive committee because of such improper contacts, such as
buying young defendants clothing and books.
   In 1982, the state Commission on Judicial Conduct also privately
admonished Little. The commission had received a complaint as early
as 1981 from the King County prosecutor's office that Little was
violating the Code of Judicial Conduct by having out-of-court
contact with juvenile offenders, and the prosecutor's office
followed up with a second report in 1983, The Times reported.
   The commission's action was not made public until 1985; Little
had been re-elected in 1984.
   Two of the men who told the Post-Intelligencer that Little had
sex with them when they were teen-agers said they gave long
statements to the commission years later, one in 1981 and the other
in 1985.
   But the commission apparently never acted on those statements,
because it had adopted a policy not to pursue allegations of
misconduct that allegedly occurred before the commission was formed
in December 1980.
   The commission's chairman, Colfax attorney Wesley A. Nuxoll,
said he thinks the commission's confidential proceedings are
necessary to encourage people to come forward with complaints and
speak freely about them.
   He also said he would have reservations about modifying the rule
against considering pre-1980 cases, and thinks ``it would be a
serious mistake'' to make all complaints public.

   National elections will be held
in May 1989, with the winner of the presidential race taking office
the following Dec. 10, Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia said
Friday.
   Nosiglia did not set a date in May.
   Half of the 254 seats in the House of Deputies will be up for
election next year, as well as about one-third of the 46 seats in
the Senate. Voting also will take place for mayors in cities and
towns across this country of 30 million.
   President Raul Alfonsin, inaugurated to a six-year term on Dec.
10 1983, is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election. He
has said he will leave office ``not one day before and not one day
after'' the constitutional limit.
   Alfonsin, a civilian, was elected in October 1983 to replace the
discredited military junta. The junta led this South American
republic to war with Britain in 1982 over the Falkland Islands,
which both countries claimed. Britain won.
   The two main political parties nominated presidential candidates
last month _ Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of Alfonsin's Radical Civic
Union and Carlos Saul Menem of the opposition Peronist Party. Both
are center-right provincial governors.
   The economy is shaping up as the main election issue. With real
wages being driven down by inflation, Menem's chances to succeed
Alfonsin have brightened. The $56 billion foreign debt is
third-highest in the developing world. Inflation rose by 178
percent this year before Alfonsin devalued the austral two weeks
ago and worked out agreements with business and labor to restrict
price and wage increases.
   Alfonsin and Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille claim the monthly
inflation rate will be single-digit by September. The president of
the Central Bank, Jose Luis Machinea, says he will resign if the
anti-inflation plan does not work.

<HEAD>Loma Linda Suspends Organ Harvesting Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loma Linda University Medical Center
has quietly suspended a program to harvest organs of infants born
with most of their brains missing after 13 failed attempts to make
the program work, officials said.
   The hospital will honor prior commitments to attempt organ
harvesting in two unborn anencephalic infants, but no other infants
will be accepted in the immediate future, officials said.
   The decision last month to stop the program was never announced.
But Dr. Joyce L. Peabody, Loma Linda's chief of neonatology,
disclosed the decision during a discussion at an Aug. 10 bioethics
seminar in Oakland.
   A tape recording of the discussion was obtained by the Los
Angeles Times, which published details Friday.
   ``Certainly, if the only outcome you are looking at is the
number of solid organs transplanted, our program has failed and
failed dismally,'' Ms. Peabody said on the tape.
   Officials at Loma Linda refused to comment Friday. A spokesman
said a news conference would be called Monday or Tuesday.
   The program's future will be determined after completion of a
report Ms. Peabody is preparing for medical center officials, the
Times reported.
   Anencephalics are born missing sections of the brain and skull.
Most die at birth or shortly thereafter.
   ``It takes a particular amount of courage to acknowledge that
you may have made a mistake,'' said Leslie Rothenberg, a faculty
member at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center
and a medical ethics specialist who had criticized the Loma Linda
program.
   The program began last December, two months after renowned Loma
Linda surgeon Dr. Leonard Bailey transplanted a heart from an
anencephalic child declared brain dead in Canada.
   Anencephalics are used as organ donors in Canada and Western
Europe but Loma Linda had the only such program in the United
States.
   The hospital's guidelines for using anencephalics required that
the babies meet medical criteria that would declare them brain dead
within seven days of their entry into the program.
   Of the first seven babies taking part in the hospital's program,
one was a stillborn and five failed to meet the criteria.
   No suitable recipient could be found for the organs of the one
baby that did meet the brain-death requirements and was thus
eligible as a donor.
   Five of the next six babies reached ``imminent death'' within a
week of birth, but four were determined to be unsuitable as donors.

   Two Canadian men in an 18-foot sailboat completed
a voyage that has eluded Arctic explorers for hundreds of years,
but it took them three summers to do it, the Toronto Globe and Mail
reported Friday.
   It said Jeffrey MacInnis, a business college student, and
photographer Michael Beedell arrived Wednesday in Pond Inlet on
Baffin Island, becoming the first explorers to sail through the icy
Northwest Passage in a craft powered only by the wind.
   MacInnis, 25, and Beedell, 32, began their 2,480-mile
west-to-east journey three years ago at Inuvik on the Beaufort Sea,
according to the report.
   They reported they covered up to 100 miles a day, sailing in a
yellow catamaran.
   The two men said they completed their trip on their 100th day of
sailing after spending the winters in southern Canada. They brought
their boat, the Perception, into Pond Inlet and were met by
friends, relatives and sponsors of the $123,000 adventure.
   ``It was an opportunity to experience how the early explorers
traveled through the Arctic, which was on the environment's
terms,'' MacInnis said in a telephone interview.
   He reported encounters with Arctic animals, including 1,500
beluga whales in a bay near the northern tip of Somerset Island. He
said the whales entertained them with their ``chirping, grunting,
belching, burping and tail-flapping.''
   MacInnis said he and Beedell often were numb from the cold as
fierce winds and freezing spray washed over the exposed boat.
   ``Sure, there were times when you were cursing and wishing you
would never see ice again, but it's something that's absolutely a
beautiful sight,'' he said.

   Romania has refused to let a United Nations human
rights panel examine Romania's treatment of one of the panel's own
special investigators, a U.N. official said.
   The East European nation barred entrance to two members of the
panel who were hoping to meet with Dumitru Mazilu, a Romanian
colleague who recently resigned, said U.N. Under-Secretary General
for Human Rights Jan Martenson Wednesday.
   Mazilu had informed the U.N. group by letter in April that his
government had pressured him to drop his study of youths and human
rights, forced him to retire, confiscated his passport and put him
under police surveillance.
   Mazilu had been expected to present a report on his research at
the current session of the U.N. Subcommission on the Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.
   Romanian officials advised the panel that Mazilu would be unable
to attend due to a heart condition. They said he had left Bucharest
to undergo treatment at an unspecified resort.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor rested at home
Friday after being treated for more than three weeks at a hospital
for back problems, officials said.
   Miss Taylor was admitted July 25 to St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica for a compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra that
produced lower back muscular spasms, hospital spokeswoman Mary
Miller said.
   The actress was released Thursday after strict bed rest and
physical therapy, Ms. Miller said.
   Miss Taylor hurt herself last month when she fell on the set of
the film ``Young Toscannini,'' her publicist, Chen Sam, said.
   She has suffered back problems since she fell off a horse and
fractured her spine 30 years ago, Ms. Sam said.
   The actress will continue physical therapy and rest at home to
prepare for a promotional tour for her fragrance line, another
publicist, Lucinda Marshall said.

<HEAD>Court Says OPM Acted `Arbitrarily And Capriciously'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the
Reagan administration had not justified its failure to replace with
new examinations a civil service test that was found to
discriminate against minorities.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said the Office of
Personnel Management acted ``arbitrarily and capriciously'' when
did not provide figures to document its claim it would be too
costly to devise new tests.
   But the three-judge panel said OPM should be given another
opportunity to justify the decision to the judge who ordered the
agency to devise new tests for college graduates seeking
entry-level federal jobs.
   The decision came in a case brought by the National Treasury
Employees Union that challenged OPM's decision to hire employees
for entry-level positions under a non-competitive provision of the
civil service law.
   That provision gives government agencies discretion to hire
employees non-competitively.
   The employees union objected to the procedure because the
employees hired under the provision did not receive all the
protections afforded other civil-service workers.
   The dispute arose after the goverment signed a consent decree in
1982 to phase out the Professional and Administrative Career
Examination to settle a lawsuit claiming the test discriminated
unfairly against minorities.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green ordered OPM to devise new
examinations to cover specific jobs and to implement the new tests
in six months. She stayed her order to give the government an
opportunity to appeal the decision.
   The appeals court, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Douglas H.
Ginsburg, sided with Green's finding that she had jurisdiction to
examine OPM's decision and with the conclusion it was ``arbitrarily
and capricious.''
   ``OPM did not have any evidence, so far as the record reveals,
of how much it would cost to develop the necessary examinations,''
Ginsburg wrote in an opinion joined by Circuit Judges Patricia Wald
and Harry Edwards.
   ``Unable to point us to any data of the sort it would have
considered if it had considered cost in any meaningful way, OPM
urges us to defer to its `expert judgment regarding the cost of
developing new examinations.'''
   ``There is no indication, in the record, however, that OPM ever
made an expert judgment about what those costs would be,'' Ginsburg
wrote.
   OPM spokesman Dick McGowan said the agency would not comment on
the decision.
   In June, OPM Administrator Constance Horner announced a new
program of using campus recruiters to hire college graduates based
on their academic records and interviews. Horner said the agency
would also devise competitive examinations for students who did not
have high enough grades to be hired through interviews.
   The treasury employees union has filed a new suit to challenge
the proposal, contending it will not result in competitive hiring.
   The union's president, Robert Tobias, said Friday's decision
means that OPM ``can no longer ignore their obligation to develop
an alternative system.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,500 workers at the state
power company stayed out on strike Friday to demand the release of
an arrested union leader, a union source said.
   The source said 40 workers at the Institute of Electrification
and Hydraulic Resources were arrested Tuesday when they cut service
to three pro-government newspapers and a television station, which
together owed about $500,000 in unpaid bills.
   The cutoff was not authorized by management, the source said. He
spoke on condition of not being identified, fearing reprisals.
   He said 39 of those arrested were freed Thursday night, but the
general secretary of the electrical worker's union, Isaac
Rodriguez, remained in jail.
   Union members, who spoke also on condition of anonymity, said
the 39 were freed after union leaders met with Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and Panama's de
facto ruler.
   The members refused to give details of the meeting, but said the
workers and government agreed to set up a three-member committee to
direct the utility with representatives from the armed forces,
management and labor.
   They said Rodriguez was on a hunger strike at Modelo Prison in
Panama City and that relatives and friends were kept from visiting
him.
   But a prison official told The Associated Press on Friday that
Rodriguez ``no longer is here.'' He did not say where Rodriguez was.
   The union source said that virtually all of the Institute's
5,500 workers walked off the job Tuesday after the arrests and
vowed not to return until Rodriguez is freed.
   The walkout delayed maintenance and repair work, but the
nation's power supply was not affected.
   The source said Rodriguez and the others cut electricity to
Editorial Renovacion, which publishes the newspapers Critica,
Matutino and La Republica, to protest administrative and financial
difficulties at the institute they say were caused in part by the
firm's failure to pay.
   Matutino did not publish Wednesday but resumed publication on
Thursday. Operations at the other newspapers were unaffected.
   The workers also tried to cut service to Channel 2 national
television, but it was not affected.
   The union members complained that the institute usually cuts off
service when the poor do not pay their bills, but extends credit to
big companies that are influential with the government.

<HEAD>With AM-Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli middleman in the Iran-Contra
arms-selling scandal said in an article Friday that the United
States made a ``horrendous blunder'' in trying to buy the release
of American hostages held in Lebanon.
   Yaacov Nimrodi, in 1985, helped arrange shipments of U.S.
weapons to Iran. Some of the profits went to Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras, fighting the Sandinista government.
   The scheme was carried out despite a U.S. ban on arms sales to
Iran, at war with Iraq, and the lack of congressional approval for
military aid to the Contras.
   Israel helped deliver the arms to Iran and said it was acting at
the request of the United States, which hoped to obtain the release
of Americans kidnapped in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   The article by Nimrodi was published in the Jerusalem Post.
   He said that in 1985 he and Israeli collegues Al Schwimmer and
David Kimchi ``found the key to Iran, made the right connections
with the right people and put them at the disposal of the U.S.''
   ``Unfortunately a horrendous blunder was made,'' Nimrodi wrote
in a rare public statement on the arms deal. ``Instead of homing in
on the political dimension ... the contacts, in a most natural way,
were permitted to spill over to talks on the release of hostages in
exchange for U.S. arms.''
   Nimrodi said he believes President Reagan hopes to secure the
release of the American hostages before his term ends in January,
but added that focusing on the issue of the captives ``is apt to
raise the price the Iranians will demand and make the release of
the hostages more difficult.''
   ``It is to be hoped that today the American (and Israeli)
foreign policymakers have learned from past mistakes and will
navigate their contacts with Iran so as to restore Iran to its
natural place _ the place where it wants to be and ought to be _
much closer to the West,'' Nimrodi wrote.
   ``The West will then achieve, three years later, what we sought
to achieve then.''
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held captive
in Lebanon by Moslem militants. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Nimrodi, 61, lived in Iran for 25 years, first as an agent for
Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and then as a military attache
and a private businessman.
   Nimrodi wrote that for the first time since the Iran-Contra
scandal the United States and Iran appear on the verge of improving
their relations.
   He also said Iran's ``daring decision'' to agree to a cease-fire
with Iraq in their eight-year-old war ``indicates, more than
anything else, that beyond what appears to be the irrational,
uncompromising and fanatical policy of the Iranian rulers, a
significant amount of logic and pragmatism can be discovered.''

<TEXT>
   Jose Luis Gaviria Rivero, cousin of
the head man of the Medellin drug cartel, has been arrested in the
investigation of the killings of five members of a rival gang, the
army announced Friday.
   Gaviria Rivero is a cousin of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, chief of
the Medellin cartel that has been fighting with the Cali cartel
over shipments of drugs to the United States, mainly New York.
   A statement by the army's 4th Brigade said Gaviria Rivero was
arrested Aug. 4 in a farm on the outskirts of Medelln after an
intensive search by agents of the military intelligence service.
   It said Gaviria Rivero is accused of participating in the July
11 slayings of five former military officers who were working as
gunmen for the Cali cartel with the assignment to kill leaders of
the Medellin ring.
   It is believed the two cartels, based in Medellin 150 miles
northwest of Bogota and Cali 200 miles southwest of the capital,
control 80 percent of the cocaine shipments to the United States.
   According to military reports, 78 people have been killed since
January in the fight to dominate the multibillion-dollar cocaine
market in New York.
   The feud began with the attempted bombing of Escobar Gaviria's
luxurious home.
   Military intelligence officials say 60 members of the Cali
cartel and 18 members of the Medellin mob have been killed since
January.
   Gen. Ruiz Barrera has told reporters the Medellin gangsters have
more experience in organizing assassination squads and hiring paid
killers for dangerous missions.
   Medellin killers have been blamed for the deaths of scores of
people involved in the campaign against drugs including a justice
minister, the federal attorney general, Supreme Court justices and
other judges.
   This week, a bomb destroyed a pharmacy in downtown Medelln owned
by Gilberto Rodrguez Orejuela who is believed to be a leader of the
Cali cartel. He is sought by the United States for drug trafficking.
   The Cali cartel once controlled New York's cocaine market, but
it has lost ground to the Medellin organization, according to
anti-drug officials here.

   Amendments to the constitution went into
effect Friday, giving President Daniel arap Moi greater control
over the judiciary and broadening the arrest powers of the police.
   The amendments were printed Friday in a supplement to the Kenya
Gazette.
   Parliament voted unanimously Aug. 2 to amend the constitution to
empower the president to fire a High Court judge or Court of
Appeals judge without reason and without having to go through a
tribunal process.
   It gave the head of state the same power to fire members of the
Public Service Commission.
   Parliament also changed the constitution to allow police to hold
a capital crime suspect for 14 days instead of the previous 24
hours before bringing him to court.
   Traditionally, there is a 14-day waiting period between the time
a constitutional change is proposed and debate in Parliament. But
the measures sailed through the chamber unopposed five days after
the attorney general proposed them.
   Lawyers and clergymen fought the changes, saying they would
erode the checks and balances between the executive and the
judiciary and undermine individual liberties.
   Kenya, by law, is a one-party state and approval of the
constitutional changes had been expected.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's military rulers have
announced they will revise tax laws in a move to stimulate national
and international investment in Haiti.
   ``Business recovery depends on the maintenance of social peace
of which the military government is the guarantor, and especially
on a restructuring of our institutions and a revision of our
laws,'' Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy said in a speech to businessmen
published Thursday by the state-run newspaper, L'Union.
   ``The code of investments is being updated ... Other codes which
are incentives for investment are under study. They concern
tourism, agriculture and commerce,'' he said.
   Joel Thebaud, executive director of Prominex, an investment
promotion firm, said the measure is ``very encouraging. It shows
(the government) has opened up to the private sector.
   ``The revision will mainly concern tax exemptions, to improve
conditions for both national and international investment,''
Thebaud told The Associated Press on Friday. ``This step will give
new life to the business world.''
   Namphy returned to power after four months of civilian rule
following an army coup on June 19 that sent President Leslie
Manigat into exile. Namphy had previously led a junta during the 24
months after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in
February 1986.
   Commerce Minister Col. Erick Brunel Lamour criticized the
international condemnation of Haiti's army rulers that followed the
June 19 coup.
   ``We are condemned by an increasingly hostile external
environment to promote ... the improvement of living conditions for
our courageous and good people which has been punished for not
revolting against our government,'' Lamour was quoted as saying in
an interview with L'Union.
   The United States suspended $60 million of its $90 million aid
package to Haiti after gunmen protected by soldiers killed at least
34 voters during the aborted Nov. 29 elections.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday supported
a judge's order imposing a property tax increase to finance Kansas
City school desegregation but said the judge overstepped his
authority when he imposed an income tax surcharge.
   Gov. John Ashcroft criticized the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling, saying it ``is one more step toward the day when
federal judges control more and more institutions in our society _
our prisons, schools and social services programs.''
   U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark ordered the tax increases
in September 1987 to pay for desegregation in the Kansas City
School District. The money also was for construction of new schools
that could lure white students from the suburbs and private schools.
   Many of the city's school buildings have ``literally rotted,''
Clark said. About three-quarters of the students are minorities _
about two-thirds of them are black.
   Clark ordered the tax increases when no money was available to
finance the construction of new schools and after voters in the
district turned down six proposals to increase taxes for education
between 1970 and 1983.
   He ordered that taxes on property in the school district be
almost doubled and that people who worked in Kansas City, whether
or not they lived there, pay a 1.5 percent state income tax
surcharge.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster appealed Clark's
order. Among those filing briefs opposing the taxes were the
Justice Department, the state of Kansas and U.S. Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo.
   In its ruling Friday, the appeals court dismissed the state's
contention that Clark exceeded his judicial authority in imposing
the property tax increase.
   The three-member panel in St. Louis said it holds that federal
courts' ``powers to remedy the evils of segregation include a
narrowly defined power to order increases in local tax levies on
real estate.''
   The court said it had ruled in another case that a federal court
could impose such a tax increase ``only after exploration of every
other fiscal alternative.''
   But noting that the property tax is the established source of
revenue for Missouri's school districts, the court said Clark could
not impose a state income tax surcharge because it ``restructure's
the state's scheme of school financing and creates an entirely new
form of taxing authority.''
   ``We are satisfied that the district court invaded the province
of the Legislature in ordering this surcharge,'' the appellate
court ruled, adding that unspent revenues must be refunded.
   The appeals court dismissed the state's contention that the
federal judge had exceeded his authority in imposing the property
tax increase.
   Bobby George, a spokesman for the Missouri attorney general's
office, said the state would appeal all or part of the ruling or
ask for a rehearing by the full appeals court.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden applauded the decision. Kansans who
worked in Kansas City, Mo., were affected by the income tax
surcharge.
   Officials of the Landmark Legal Foundation, which had been a
party in an appeal of the Clark's order, vowed to continue the
effort to overturn the property tax increase.
   Clark's ruling stemmed from a 1977 lawsuit filed on behalf of
Kansas City students that sought to correct the decline of
predominantly black urban schools. The U.S. District Court found
that the city school district had allowed vestiges of segregation
to remain, despite U.S. Supreme Court orders ordering desegration
in 1954 and 1969.

   Soviet prosecutors have begun legal action against
railway officials accused of negligence in the crash of a
high-speed passenger train in which 25 people died, the Tass news
agency said Friday.
   Tass said damage was estimated at about $700,000 in Tuesday's
crash of the Aurora train carrying 760 passengers from Leningrad to
Moscow.
   Vladimir Ginko, first deputy railway minister, told Tass that
railway foreman T. Gavrilov incorrectly raised a speed limit that
had been imposed on the track near the town of Bologoye, 180 miles
northwest of Moscow.
   He said T. Khrustalev, head of the local railroad
administration, had not acted in time to countermand Gavrilov.
   ``Criminal proceedings have been instituted against the
culprits,'' Tass said.
   It did not say what charges were leveled against them.
   Tass said the death toll had reached 25, including 22 people
dead at the scene and three who died later in hospitals.
   It said 79 people remained hospitalized of the 107 initially
admitted.
   The Aurora, speeding south at 90 mph, went off the track, turned
over and caught fire Tuesday evening.
   Officials say a speed limit of 40 mph was ordered on the track
by an inspection crew that noticed a deviation in the rails, but
that the train's engineers were never told about the limit.
   They spotted the deviation but could not stop in time, Soviet
media reported.

<HEAD>Reagan's Mention of 200 Flavors of Ice Cream Scoops Up a Memory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Reagan mentioned 200 flavors of
ice cream on national television, it scooped up a 19-year-old
memory for Mark Hawley.
   Reagan, speaking Monday night to the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans, quoted from Hawley's essay on ``Why I
Love America.''
   ``I love America because you can join Cub Scouts if you want
to,'' Reagan read. ``You have a right to worship as you please. If
you have the ability, you can try to be anything you want to be. I
also like America because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream.''
   Reagan didn't mention Hawley's name, but said the words were
written by ``a young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took
office'' in 1981.
   Not quite right, says Hawley, now a 28-year-old mechanic for The
Boeing Co.
   ``I never wrote President Reagan,'' Hawley said in a telephone
interview Thursday. ``That (essay) was printed in Scouting Magazine
in the fall of 1969.
   ``It was part of a requirement for a Cub Scout badge, probably
citizenship or something.''
   Hawley, of the Seattle suburb of Burien, said he didn't watch
Reagan's speech, but heard a co-worker talking about the ``200
flavors of ice cream'' reference.
   He said he later received word from a Reagan aide that she had
been trying to track him down for two weeks.

   A series of underground explosions
ripped through this seacoast city Friday, damaging two houses and
forcing 200 people to evacuate their homes and businesses,
authorities said. No one was injured.
   ``I heard a loud explosion. I looked out, the sewer manhole
cover blew off the ground,'' said merchant Patricia Genest. ``None
of us knew what was going on at all. People were running away from
sewers and manhole covers.''
   ``It sounded like bombs going off. It was one manhole right
after the other,'' said gas station owner John Curley. The
explosions took place about a quarter mile from the city's downtown
and not far from a famous statue of a fisherman.
   The explosions apparently were caused by gasoline in the sewer
system, said Fire Chief Barry McKay.
   Mayor William Squillace declared a state of emergency at 5:30
p.m., but lifted it about two hours later.
   ``We seem to have everything under control,'' he said about 9
p.m., five hours after the blasts. ``We've done a reading in the
sewer system of the possibility of an explosion, and there is no
danger of an explosion. All of the systems have been vented.''
   ``We had a series of underground explosions _ about 10 right in
a row _ and now they're evacuating the area and it's causing a
major traffic jam,'' said police Officer Merrill Newman. ``The
telephone just lit up like a Christmas tree and people were almost
hysterical.''
   Gloucester Fire Capt. Louis Aiello said six trucks responded to
the alarms.
   Authorities suspect the explosions were set off by the removal
of a gasoline tank from a petroleum products distribution yard,
McKay said.
   ``There was a company removing a gasoline tank upstream of the
sewer system,'' he said. State and federal investigators will try
to determine whether the gasoline was the source of the explosions
and how it might have entered the sewer system, he said.
   A strong smell of gasoline hovered in the area hours after the
explosions.
   Smoke and some flames were visible after the explosions, but
officials said any fires in the sewer system apparently
extinguished themselves.
   Officials said they believe the gasoline caused about 20 manhole
covers to blow as it traveled through the sewer system.
   Built-up pressure vented at two houses, causing some structural
damage. The blast cracked a concrete patio at the home of Pat
Cusick, 32, a construction worker. It also broke his 35-foot
concrete driveway into chunks the size of telephone books.
   ``I'm a nervous wreck,'' Cusick said, surveying the damage and
holding up five wooden steps leading to his back door that broke
loose in the blast. He said he was driving toward home when he saw
a manhole cover blow. ``I saw flames shoot right out of the
manhole.''
   Cusick said he was glad he did not arrive home sooner. ``I would
have been parked right here,'' he said, pointing to the shattered
driveway.
   At a house across the street, half the front lawn was ripped up,
a crack ran along the foundation and the sidewalk was ruptured. A
3-foot high wall made of cinder blocks had fallen.
   ``It's amazing that nobody got killed,'' said Acting Fire Capt.
John Hautalla.
   While police earlier said hundreds of people were evacuated from
a 10-block area to a school, fire department spokesman Clarence
Rudolph said only 200 people were evacuated from a four-block area
near downtown.
   Most of the people who were told to leave their homes went to
the houses of friends or relatives, or stood by police barriers and
watched, said Charles Thomas, a director of the local Red Cross.
Only about a dozen came to the school.
   By nightfall, people were being allowed to return to their homes
behind fire officials who checked manholes for more flammable
substances.

   A U.N.-supervised cease-fire between Iran
and Iraq took hold Saturday morning after hundreds of United
Nations observers stood at position along the war front to monitor
possible violations.
   As the truce started at 7 a.m. (11 p.m. EDT), official media in
the two countries carried no reports of any major incidents along
the 730-mile front.
   Iraqis matched in the streets of Baghdad and in towns throughout
their country the night before the truce took effect, celebrating
what the official news media called Iraq's ``victory'' in the
8-year-old conflict.
   Women dressed in abayas, the traditional Arab robes, sprinkled
rose petals on the U.N. observers in blue berets as their convoy
left Baghdad for the border, which begins in the southern
marshlands and snakes north to the rugged mountains of Kurdistan.
   Iran continued questioning Iraq's motives. Hashemi Rafsanjani,
parliament speaker and military commander, said the Iraqis may not
want peace but will find Iran much stronger if they renew the war.
   Rear Adm. Mohammad Malekzadegan, the navy commander, said Iran
will stop ships to search them for war materiel until a final peace
agreement is reached. His comment was reported by Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   Iraq's general command exhorted all Arabs to ``express joy and
celebrate the victory achieved by Iraq's sons.''
   As night fell Friday, tens of thousands of people filled
Baghdad's streets and public parks.
   ``It is the happiest day in my life'' because he was due for
conscription in January, said Alaa, an 18-year-old who gave free
glasses of orange juice to passersby on Karada Street, a main
boulevard.
   The government of President Saddam Hussein said it was reopening
the airport in the battered southern port of Basra, which was the
target of repeated Iranian offensives that took tens of thousands
of lives.
   Officials said two Iraqi merchant ships would sail into the
Persian Gulf, the first to do so since early in the war.
   About 150 unarmed officers of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group fanned out along the Iraqi side of the border
Friday. Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said 200 U.N. observers
were either on their way to the Iranian side or already there.
   In New York, an official in the U.N. peacekeeping office said 95
percent of them ``are on the ground, and we're receiving excellent
cooperation from both sides.'' He asked that his name not be used.
   The Security Council authorized 350 truce observers from 24
nations and about 950 support personnel for an initial period of
six months at a cost of $75.6 million.
   Brig. Gen. V.M. Patil of India heads the group of U.N. observers
in Iraq and an Irish officer, whose name has not been announced,
will head the group in Iran. A Yugoslav officer, Gen. Slavko Jovic
of Yugoslavia commands the entire operation and will shuttle
between the two countries.
   The cease-fire process began July 18 with Iran's acceptance of
the year-old Security Council Resolution 598, which calls for a
truce, withdrawl to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace
talks and an investigation of which side started the war.
   Peace negotiations will begin in Geneva on Thursday, mediated by
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general
   Rafsanjani said in a sermon at weekly prayers Friday: ``We are
facing two paths, war and peace. We chose peace but we are not sure
about Iraq. If the enemy wants to continue the war, it will
continue much more seriously.
   ``Iranian forces have become much stronger and more experienced.
This war was a great help to the export of our revolution and all
the world realized that Iran resisted without any help.''
   According to the Iraqi command, Baghdad's forces will honor the
truce ``conscientiously and responsibly.''
   It said the cease-fire would open the way for a new relationship
with Iran that would be ``different from the framework of slogans
of expansion, aggression, hatred and evil with which the Iranians
ignited the war.''
   ``Our bitter experience, and the sea of blood that the Iranian
aggression caused, make it our responsibility not to deal with Iran
on the basis of wishful thinking but on the basis of reality so
that we are not cheated again,'' it said.
   At least 1 million people have been killed or wounded in the
war, which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after
several border skirmishes. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass
1 million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   Iraq said the Basra airport would reopen Saturday and was
prepared to handle both domestic and international flights.
   Basra, Iraq's second largest city and main port, closed its
airport to civilian traffic early in the war. It is only 20 miles
from the border at the northern end of the disputed Shatt al-Arab,
which forms the southern frontier.
   The official Iraq News Agency said an Iraqi merchant vessel, the
Idrissi, would sail into the gulf from the Khor al-Zubair port on
Iraq's Khor Abdullah waterway and another ship, the Khawlah, would
enter from Fijairah in the Gulf of Oman. Iran's navy blockaded
Iraqi shipping in the early months of the war.
   Nations supplying personnel to the observer corps are Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana,
Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey,
Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<TEXT>
   A college professor who admitted he made a
racially and sexually offensive remark to a student was suspended
without pay Thursday for the fall quarter.
   Georgia Southwestern College professor Allen Towery, who
verbally attacked the student during a heated argument March 7, can
resume teaching when the winter quarter begins in January.
   ``At that time, I will allow Dr. Towery to return to teaching,
but only after he has submitted a correction plan which will
include measures to improve his performance in the specific areas
for which discipline is being administered,'' said school President
William H. Capitan.
   Capitan originally sought to have Towery fired.
   Towery, 49, a tenured associate professor of English, said he
was provoked into making the statement to Ginevra Dennis, 18. But
other students later complained about racist or sexist remarks he
allegedly made.
   Testimony at a disciplinary hearing in June showed Ms. Dennis
had gone to Towery's office to demand a ``withdrawn passing'' grade
in his class, rather than a failing grade.
   Capitan suspended Towery with pay shortly after the incident,
and later instituted dismissal proceedings.
   A five-member committee heard testimony in June, and cleared
Towery of violating a state Board of Regents policy. However, the
committee suggested that Towery be barred from teaching freshmen.
   Capitan considered the committee's recommendation, and decided
to suspend Towery.
   Towery said Thursday he would confer with his attorney, Gene
Black Jr. of Albany, before deciding whether to appeal.
   Towery declined further comment, but Black said he may seek a
federal court injunction blocking the suspension because it could
not be appealed to the regents before fall quarter classes begin
Sept. 15.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
suffering from terminal liver cancer, remained confined to his home
Thursday because of what a spokesman described as a low white
blood-cell count that would make him vulnerable to infection.
   Presidential spokesman Eduardo Colindres denied at a news
conference persistent rumors that the 62-year-old Duarte was in a
coma. A medical bulletin signed by the president's three doctors
described his condition ``as good and stable'' and said the low
white cell count was the result of chemotherapy.
   Colindres said medical bulletins will be issued daily.
   Duarte was flown to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington in
June where surgeons removed more than half his stomach and
diagnosed terminal liver cancer. The doctors said then he had from
six to 18 months more to live.
   At Walter Reed, Duarte was given a first treatment of
chemotherapy for the cancer, and he returned again for a second
treatment during the first week in August. He flew back to San
Salvador Aug. 10.
   The medical report said the decline in the number of white blood
cells is ``a secondary effect that appears normally between the
10th and 15th day after the application of chemotherapy'' and that
Duarte was also being protected against infection with antibiotics.
   The president was confined to his home Wednesday.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono of Colombia, visiting El
Salvador, called at Duarte's home Thursday to present him with the
Grand Collar of the National Order of San Carlos, Colombia's
highest civilian decoration.

   The estranged wife of moviemaker Dino De
Laurentiis has filed for divorce, one day after his company sought
bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
   Silvana De Laurentiis filed a divorce petition Wednesday in
Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for
the split. Court documents prepared by attorney S. David Rosensen
seek unspecified spousal support.
   The couple was married July 18, 1949, and separated in September
1983, the petition said.
   De Laurentiis Entertainment Group filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code Tuesday,
which allows a company to reorganize. DEG hasn't reported 1987
financial results, but it estimates a $69 million loss.
   De Laurentiis, who produced such films as ``Blue Velvet'' and
``Crimes of the Heart,'' owns 61.9 percent of the company's shares.

   Two telephoned bomb threats forced the
evacuation Thursday night of part of LaGuardia Airport's main
terminal, causing delays in some flights, the airport's operator
said.
   The threats prompted airlines to move planes away from the
terminal, and tied up vehicular traffic in and around the airport
as the police bomb squad arrived, said Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   The first anonymous threat, at 7:07 p.m., said a bomb had been
planted in the TWA section of the main terminal, she said.
   The area was evacuated and the police bomb squad and Fire
Department responded. A package was found which proved to be ``a
hoax,'' Ms. Tierney said, adding she did not know what it contained.
   The area was reopened at 8:37 p.m., she said. During the
evacuation, TWA departures were held up and no arrivals were
scheduled.
   At 8:10 p.m., a second bomb threat was phoned in, this time
targeting the USAir section of the same terminal. By 8:24 p.m.,
that area was evacuated, Ms. Tierney said.
   USAir planes were backed away from the building during a search,
she said, and departures and arrivals were delayed.
   No package was found, the area was reopened and all operations
were back to normal by 9 p.m., the spokeswoman said.

   Attackers thought to be Maoist rebels shot
and killed two irrigation engineers and two area officials after
forcing their car to a halt on an isolated mountain road, police
said Thursday.
   They said the killers, suspected of belonging to the
Mao-inspired Shining Path, checked the victims' papers to make sure
of their identities before shooting them Wednesday night.
   Officers said the four were killed on a rugged gravel highway
while bound from the farming district of Yanacancha to Huancayo,
the state capital 55 miles east.
   The engineers were employed by the Junin State Development Corp.
and were building an irrigation system for peasant farmers of
Yanacancha. Police said the other victims were the district's
justice of the peace and its public safety officer.
   The Shining Path has killed scores of local officials and
development workers in Peru's impoverished central highlands in an
effort to spark political and economic chaos.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in
violence surrounding the Shining Path's eight-year insurgency to
topple Peru's elected government and impose a worker-peasant state
modeled on Mao Tse-tung's Marxist China.
   Huancayo is in the 2-mile-high Andes Mountains, 125 miles east
of Lima.

   Smoke from a mountain wildfire burning near
ancient Inca ruins clouded the Andean capital of Cuzco on Thursday
as an estimated 550 fire fighters struggled to put out the blaze,
authorities said.
   Civil Defense spokeswoman Rebeca Anaya said the famous Machu
Picchu ruins, 40 miles northwest of Cuzco, were no longer in danger.
   No injuries or serious property damage were reported.
   The fire began near the ancient citadel Aug. 7 and has been
pushed by winds toward Cuzco, charring more than 7,500 acres of
forest and pasture and threatening other Inca ruins less renowned
than Machu Picchu, officials said.
   Cuzco, 330 miles southeast of Lima, faces no immediate risk but
smoke has intermittently swept through the city, according to
officials.
   Police said a peasant was arrested for starting the fire in an
attempt to clear land for crops.
   Officials said a daily tourist train between Cuzco and Machu
Picchu continued in operation but the Inca Trail, a path used by
tourists to trek to the mountaintop citadel in hikes taking several
days, has been temporarily closed.

   Hal M. Freeman, who resigned his post as
Western regional manager of federal Office of Civil Rights in
protest of White House policy on AIDS victims, has died of cardiac
arrest and complications of AIDS.
   Freeman, 52, died at Kaiser Hospital on July 30, his longtime
companion, Michael S. Macpherson, said Thursday.
   The duties of the civil rights office include preventing
discrimination against people who are handicapped. When he resigned
his post on Feb. 20, 1986, Freeman said he was quitting because the
Department of Health and Human Services had refused to apply the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to AIDS patients.
   ``The Reagan administration took the position at that time that
AIDS was not considered to be necessarily a handicapped position,''
Macpherson said.
   The publicity resulting from Freeman's resignation caused a
congressional inquiry and a change of policy.
   ``Persons with AIDS and ARC (AIDS-related complex) are now
protected by the Office of Civil Rights in accordance with federal
civil rights laws,'' Macpherson said.
   Freeman subsequently went into practice in San Francisco as a
psychotherapist.
   There was no funeral, Macpherson said.

<TEXT>
   Educator Rufus C. Harris, former president of
Mercer and Tulane universities who helped restore accreditation to
Georgia's state-operated colleges, died Thursday. He was 91.
   His death was caused by complications of a weekend fall in which
he broke his hip and by his age, a Mercer spokesman said.
   Harris was president of Tulane, in New Orleans, from 1937 to
1960.
   In 1943, he was chairman of a special committee of the Southern
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools that weighed the fate
of the University of Georgia and nine other institutions.
   The schools had been suspended by the association in 1941 after
Gov. Eugene Talmadge had fired educators and regents for favoring
educational opportunities for blacks. The committee restored the
Georgia schools to good standing after Talmadge's successor, Ellis
Arnall, appointed new regents and pledged to end political
interference.
   After leaving Tulane, Harris led the Baptist-affiliated Mercer,
which has campuses in Macon and Atlanta, for 20 years until 1980.
That year the position of chancellor was created for him, which he
held until his death.
   Harris persuaded Mercer's trustees to integrate the student body
in 1963 and to begin accepting federal grants in 1969.
   His wife of 63 years, Mary Louise Walker Harris, died in 1981.
Survivors include three sons, J.H. Walker Harris of Columbus and
Rufus C. Harris Jr. and Louie K. Harris, both of New Orleans; nine
grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
   A graveside service will be at 10 a.m. Saturday at Rest Haven
Cemetery in Monroe.

<TEXT>
   China and the Soviet Union will hold talks in
Beijing on Aug. 27 to seek solutions to the Cambodian conflict and
improvement in strained Chinese-Soviet relations, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jin Guihua said Thursday. He said at a weekly briefing
that the talks will focus on Cambodia and will be led by Soviet
Vice Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev and his Chinese counterpart
Tian Zengpei. The meeting is expected to last several days.
   ``The Chinese will be in a listening mode,'' said one Western
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They'll be waiting
to see what the Soviets have to offer.''
   He said the Chinese remain skeptical about a quick solution to
the Cambodian conflict. He added, however, that if Moscow and
Beijing can come to terms on Cambodia, there would be ``a lot of
movement toward the normalization process'' of Chinese-Soviet
relations.
   Moscow is the main backer of Vietnam in its 9-year-old military
occupation of Cambodia. Beijing is chief supporter of the communist
Khmer Rouge and the other anti-Vietnamese resistance forces in
Cambodia.
   Communist Vietnam has pledged to withdraw 50,000 troops, or
about half its force in Cambodia, this year and the rest by early
1990.
   Both China and the Soviet Union have expressed support for a
peaceful political solution in Cambodia. They are expected to seek
ways to bring about a Vietnamese withdrawal without leaving the
nation vulnerable to a takeover by the Khmer Rouge, who launched a
reign of terror during their 1975-78 rule.
   Although it has supported the Khmer Rouge, China has agreed that
the group should not dominate a future coalition government. But
China also rejects Vietnam's attempts to link its military
withdrawal to dismantling Khmer Rouge forces.
   The Beijing meeting could also help shape the future of
Chinese-Soviet relations.
   China stresses that it will fully normalize political relations
with the Soviet Union only when the Kremlin takes action to end
Vietnam's presence in Cambodia.
   Ties between the two communist giants have been strained since
they split over ideological and strategic differences in the early
1960s.
   Political normalization talks have gone on since 1982, but
bogged down with China's objecting to Soviet military strength on
the common border, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Cambodia.
   The Communist Party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, told
Japanese journalists Tuesday that the first Chinese-Soviet summit
meeting since the breakdown of relations was possible if Moscow
first urges Vietnam to leave Cambodia.
   The Western diplomat estimated that at least a 50 percent chance
exists that 1989 will see a Chinese-Soviet summit, which probably
would bring Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Beijing to meet
China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.

<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. said Thursday an
autopsy performed on a mouse a man claimed he found in a beer can
shows it did not get there at the brewery.
   But a pathologist hired by James Harvey, who said he discovered
the rodent in a 16-ounce can of Coors on July 29, said the autopsy
was ``only slighly more scientific than tea-leaf reading.''
   Coors officials released a report from University of Florida
veterinary pathologist Claus Buergelt, who performed a
court-ordered autopsy on the mouse.
   ``The tests performed by the University of Florida clearly prove
that the mouse did not get into the can in Golden, Colo.,'' said
Cary Baird, a Coors spokeswoman.
   She said the examination did not disclose the cause of death but
showed ``the mouse was dead approximately one week or less when the
necropsy was conducted.''
   The beer was packaged on May 13, some 77 days before Harvey
reported finding the animal to Coors.
   But pathologist Ed Willey, who was hired by Harvey's attorney,
disputed the findings on the time of the rodent's death.
   Willey said that because the mouse had been kept in beer, it
would have decomposed more slowly than it would have at a natural
rate.
   ``I suggest that the only appropriate interpretation of Dr.
Buergelt's findings is that the death of the mouse was at least one
week prior to autopsy, and possibly several days or more prior to
the canning of the product,'' Willey said.
   Ms. Baird said experts were asked to determine if the condition
of the mouse was consistent with one that had been in a beer can
for that time.
   ``The answer is a resounding no,'' she said.
   ``A creature that had been in a sealed can of beer since May 13
_ when this can was packaged _ would show more evidence of
decomposition than this sample,'' she said.
   There was a one-week lapse from the time Harvey reported his
find to Coors until the mouse was examined.
   ``Although the report indicates that the mouse was dead less
than one week, it is critical to note here that the sample was
frozen at least twice during the week. Freezing greatly retards
decompostion, thus making the reported time frame consistent with
how the sample was actually handled,'' she said.
   Harvey, 30, an unemployed construction worker, told the media he
found the mouse after sipping a Coors beer and becoming ill. He and
a television crew took the can to the Jacksonville Health
Department on Aug. 3. Officials there cut the can open and poured
out its contents, which included a dead mouse.
   Harvey's attorney, Gary Pajcic, said that his client is out of
state and would not be available for comment.

<TEXT>
   A shootout Thursday between suspected
drug traffickers and Mexican authorities near this border city left
at least two people dead and five others wounded, including two
soldiers, according to reporters.
   Military and civilian police officials refused to release
details of the incident. But Fernando Romero of The Tribune of San
Diego was told by Tijuana police that the shootout occurred
Thursday morning at a ranch outside the city.
   The police officers, who refused to be identified, told Romero
that one of the alleged drug dealers was shot to death at the
ranch, called Los Olivos. The second man died at a hospital, police
said.
   According to an earlier report from Araceli Dominguez, a
reporter with the newspaper ABC, four people were killed and six
were wounded in the shootout, which he said involved army troops
and federal judicial police.
   Two wounded soldiers were listed in stable condition after being
moved from the Mexican Institute of Social Security Hospital in
Tijuana to the Naval Hospital in Ensenada, said Dr. Ariel Perez
Munoz.
   Three other men were wounded in the shootout nine miles south of
Tijuana, which occurred as the soldiers either raided or prepared
to raid the ranch, police sources told Romero.
   Those at the ranch may have been tipped off about the raid,
triggering the shootout, the sources said. Police also indicated
that a cache of weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles, may have
been seized.

   George Bush delighted the Republican
convention Thursday night by poking fun at his own blueblood
background while tweaking Democratic efforts to disparage him.
   At the Democratic convention in Atlanta last month, Ann
Richards, the Texas state treasurer, drew a big laugh in her
keynote speech by saying that Bush was born with a silver foot in
his mouth.
   Bush mentioned his wealthy Connecticut background Thursday
night, saying, ``Yes, my parents were prosperous.'' But he said he
also had known a simple way of life when he moved to Texas and
started his own business as a young, newly-married man.
   ``I learned a few things about life in a place called Texas,''
he said.
   ``When I was working on this part of the speech, Barbara came in
and asked what I was doing and I looked up and I said, `I'm working
hard.' And she said, `Oh dear, don't worry. Relax, sit back, take
off your shoes and put up your silver foot.'''
   The convention hall erupted in laughter and applause.

   The odds the government is putting on an end
to the drought over the next couple of months would likely be of
little interest to even the most dedicated riverboat gambler.
   The probability of getting enough rain to end the drought ranges
``from 1 in 500 for central Iowa to 1 in 1,000'' for at least three
other major drought regions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reports.
   In central Iowa, for example, the amount of rain needed by Oct.
31 to end the drought totals 22.42 inches. That amount can be
expected in the August-October period only once in 500 years, the
advisory said.
   The other three all came out to one chance in 1,000 of getting
enough rain by the end of October to declare the drought broken.
Those areas are northeastern Montana, near the North Dakota border;
the east slope of the Cascades in Washington; and Tennessee.

widened last year as strong economic growth continued for coastal
states while states in America's heartland did not fare as well,
the government reports.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that the current economic
expansion is the first in 28 years in which regional differences in
incomes have grown larger rather than narrowing.
   The department said all 10 of the states with the highest

eight along the Atlantic and two, California and Alaska, on the

   Crew members of the U.S. Navy cruiser
Vincennes made several understandable mistakes under ``the fog of
war'' before the ship blew an Iranian airliner from the sky last
month, but none was negligent and no disciplinary action is
warranted, Pentagon leaders said Friday.
   The stress of combat probably contributed to the crew's
inability to positively identify the aircraft as a commercial
flight, which approached the ship in the midst of a surface battlgunboats,
said Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as
they released findings of a board of inquiry.
   Cae
with Iranian rlucci said the investigation would lead to a number of
changes, including modifying the devices that display critical
information on approaching targets in the cruisers and subjecting
operators of their Aegis air defense systems to psychological
testing to ensure they are ready for combat.

   The bumper stickers bragged, ``Nothing could
be finer than to eat at Digger's Diner.'' Now it's a diner to go.
   Anyone willing to flip flapjacks and hamburgers _ and pay the
cost of moving it _ can have the 1940s-vintage restaurant free of
charge, says William ``Digger'' Young.
   He grew tired of the diner chores because he also was juggling
jobs as a mortician, Butler County coroner, and ``Clown on Roller
Skates'' at children's hospitals and nursing homes.
   ``It's just that I wore too many hats. I'd ... put an apron on
over my suit and pour coffee. You didn't catch me cooking, but I'd
be running the cash register. I liked to be where the money was,''
he said.
   Young, 55, got his nickname from the funeral business his family
has owned since 1896.
   His funeral home is next to the diner, painted brown and yellow
to match. But the location is purely coincidental. Unlike the
funeral business, Young's diner brought customers back, before it
closed a few years ago.
   ``We had great food. Some of my customers were seven days a
week. Some would have breakfast and their evening meals there,
too,'' he said.
   Young wants to use the land occupied by the diner to expand the
funeral home and has been trying to sell the all-steel building for
two years. When no buyers nibbled, he decided to give it away and
placed newspaper ads that offered it ``free for the moving.''
   So far, the response has been pretty dead because no one has
been willing to pay the several thousand dollars necessary to have
the diner dismantled and moved, Young said.
   ``When they find out what it will cost to move it, they don't
seem to want to go any further,'' he said.
   The diner is the all-American variety, a Jerry O'Mahoney Inc.
special from Elizabeth, N.J., with curvaceous lines, stainless
steel trim, vinyl-covered stools and formica counters. It arrived
in Butler on two flatbed trucks in the early 1940s and had several
owners until Young bought it seven years ago.
   The pie was homemade, the burgers thick and the cereal came in
little boxes.
   But now all that's left is the building. Young sold the
refrigerators and countertops to a pizza restaurant in Illinois,
the pizza oven to a Pennsylvania campground, and the stoves, grill
and cash register to a Youngstown, Ohio, restaurant.
   ``Nobody would come in and take the whole place,'' he said.
``Then it got to be that I just started stripping things apart.''
   Stale cake donuts, paper doilies and a baby's yellow rattle
litter the dirty floor, and the walls in the kitchen area are
coated with decades of grease.
   But Young says there's still plenty of life in the diner, which,
with its concrete floor and industrial-strength walls, seems built
to last.
   ``There's stainless inside, good stainless,'' he said, picking
through the rubble to reveal an old menu. ``Paint that steel and
polish the stainless and you have a pretty good looking building.''
   But more than anything, it was an institution in this bustling
western Pennsylvania city of about 17,000. As a teen-ager, Young
remembers well the lines that formed outside.
   ``People waited to get in. It was a very busy diner,'' he said.
   When Young ran the diner, it featured such culinary specialties
as the ``Digger Special'' _ a hamburger topped with a fried egg and
sauteed mushrooms, his favorite.
   Speaking of his decision to give the diner away, he said, ``I'd
like to see it used someplace, and I'd go past and say, `That used
to be mine.'''

<HEAD>Director Peter Bogdanovich Rediscovers Old Movies on TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The best place to discover old movies isn't
on ``The Late, Late Show'' anymore. It's on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Every Thursday on the CBS program, director Peter Bogdanovich
praises classic films available on videocassette. Through the
five-minute pieces, ``CBS This Morning'' viewers have been
presented with the works of George Cukor, Howard Hawks and Preston
Sturges.
   Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy, so far, have been left alone.
   ``I don't think a film is an old film just because it was made
many years ago,'' Bogdanovich said.
   ``If it's a good picture, it's still new for those people who
haven't seen it before. There are so many films that I wish I could
be seeing again for the first time. ... Part of the impetus for
doing this is the need for another small voice out there helping
people enjoy themselves and see something good.''
   The director of ``The Last Picture Show,'' ``Paper Moon'' and
``Mask,'' Bogdanovich has spent much of his career discussing film
history.
   ``I've always been interested in the tradition of Hollywood and
the past. I've always written about all the directors, and that was
something I was interested in before I ever started directing.''
   As Bogdanovich looks at it, today's filmgoers have been blanched
by a stream of mediocre movies and empty television shows.
Furthermore, films from Hollywood's golden era now are considered
old-fashioned and, therefore, avoided.
   ``I think this whole generation _ people in their teens and
early 20s _ doesn't know about old movies at all,'' Bogdanovich
said. ``Kids don't like things that their parents like. So asking
somebody to watch a black and white movie is as though we're asking
them to listen to Glenn Miller or something.''
   Given the choice between Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 film ``To Be or
Not to Be'' and Alan Johnson's 1982 remake, which one will most
video shoppers choose? ``The new one, because it's in color and
stars Mel Brooks,'' Bogdanovich said. ``Nobody knows who Carole
Lombard and Jack Benny are.''
   When a movie is seen on a television screen, not in the
theaters, the film's impact is reduced, Bogdanovich said. ``There
is a tremendous difference between seeing a movie on video and
seeing it on a big screen. But I guess it's better to see a
reproduction of a painting in a book than to never see the painting
at all.
   ``What I have been trying to do is convey to the consumer when
he walks into a video store and is confronted by all these titles,
`How do I know what to get?' It's tough to know. If you see a shelf
of John Wayne pictures, there's `Rio Grande' and `The Searchers'
and `Tall in the Saddle.' So how do you know if `Tall in the
Saddle' is as good as the others?''
   Bogdanovich finds that television has certain advantages over
magazine columns, his usual forum for film criticism.
   ``At some point, early on, it struck me that while five minutes
on television isn't much, five minutes in a movie is a long time.
So I've been approaching these as five-minute movies. I try to use
the visual _ the video clips _ and the audio as two separate
things. The visual gives you information that I am not repeating in
the audio. So you are getting twice as much information as you
normally get.''
   Bogdanovich does not devote each ``CBS This Morning'' segment to
one director. He has also looked at political films, screwball
comedies, Oscar losers and MGM musicals.
   Two contemporary directors _ Elaine May and John Cassavetes _
have been profiled.
   Which is not to say, though, that Bogdanovich is swept away with
the contemporary cinema; he said ``there is no question'' that it's
far inferior than movies of the '40s and '50s.
   ``I'm not saying there are not some good picture makers
around,'' Bogdanovich said. ``But ... since the early '60s, the
golden age of American film has ended as I see it.''
   If, as Bogdanovich hopes, he returns to feature film production,
he may no longer have time for his ``CBS This Morning'' series.
   Bogdanovich said he plans to direct ``Texasville,'' Larry
McMurtry's sequel to ``The Last Picture Show,'' next spring, with a
cast that includes Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman
and Eileen Brennan.
   Until then, he'll look to the past.

<HEAD>Radical Black Leader is Strong Voice in Britain's Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bernie Grant was branded a public enemy three
years ago for defending black youths involved in a north London
riot in which a policeman was hacked to death.
   Today, far from being hounded out of public life, 44-year-old
Grant is a member of Parliament and perhaps the most influential
black politician in Britain.
   When Grant, Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng won seats for the
opposition Labor Party in the June 1987 election to become the
first blacks ever to enter the House of Commons, many hailed it as
a breakthrough for Britain's 2.4 million blacks.
   Those who feared that Grant's flamboyant radicalism would prove
disruptive have been confounded. With his greying beard,
gap-toothed smile and melodious Caribbean accent, Grant has emerged
as a charming conversationalist and a dedicated parliamentarian.
   ``I suppose some people must have expected me to act in a
certain way and they were probably surprised,'' he said in an
interview. ``But I haven't adjusted my approach to politics in any
way.''
   That approach holds that the 4-percent black minority ``are at
the bottom of the pile'' and becoming ``a powder keg'' in the inner
cities.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there were another disturbance
tomorrow,'' he said. ``It's there and it's going to happen because
the government isn't paying any attention to it.
   ``We've got our backs to the wall, and we're fighting against a
very racist government that discriminates against black people.
   ``The problem I think black people are facing now isn't the
overt racism that to a large extent happened in the 60s ... but
it's the unconscious racism, the racism of the people that make
policy that will affect a large amount of black people adversely.''
   Grant emigrated from his native Guyana, a former British colony
on South America's northeast coast, to Britain in 1963. Here he
became the first black ever to head a municipal council, leading
the north London borough of Haringey for three years.
   He burst into national prominence in 1985 when an impoverished
housing project in the Tottenham area of Haringey erupted in riots
and the policeman was hacked to death _ the first ever to die in
British race-related unrest.
   Grant accused the predominantly white police force of sparking
the violence and, in his most controversial utterance, said the
blacks felt they had given the police ``a bloody good hiding
(thrashing).''
   He insisted he was not seeking to justify the killing but simply
explaining how other blacks felt about it.
   The effect was incendiary.
   The right-wing tabloid press called him ``Barmy Bernie,'' Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd branded him ``a high priest of race
conflict,'' and nearly 1,000 Haringey borough workers staged a
one-day strike demanding his resignation. His white girlfriend,
councilor Sharon Lawrence, received death threats.
   ``I've never denied it,'' he says now, ``I've never regretted
it, I've never withdrawn what I said. My position at the time was
to put forward the views of the young people.
   ``It defused the situation. A lot of the newspapers turned on
me. ... I was quite clear in what I was doing.''
   In the 1987 election, he carried Tottenham, where 37 percent of
the electorate are black or Asian, with a sharply reduced Labor
majority.
   In his maiden speech to Parliament, Grant said that unless young
blacks were offered better prospects, ``they will find other means
of expressing their frustration.''
   He claims police still harass black youths, using unnecessary
force and planting evidence.
   When he first arrived in Parliament, Grant said, he underwent an
initiation ceremony in which seven or eight legislators from the
governing Conservative Party gathered around him in the Smoking
Room and ``sort of baited me'' with racial innuendo.
   ``They were deliberately trying to create an incident, but it
didn't work,'' he said. ``I was quite cool.''
   When a doorman tried to eject him from the public gallery ``even
though he knew who I was,'' Grant threatened to withdraw from the
daily business of Parliament until the Speaker examined his
complaint. The doorman apologized.
   Grant has confronted Parliament with issues ranging from alleged
harassment of blacks in the armed forces to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's ``hands-off'' policy toward South Africa.
   But he said he has problems with the Labor Party too.
   He charges that its hierarchical system keeps black politicians
out of the limelight and ignores his expertise in local government
and race relations.
   Nonetheless, Grant said: ``I'm quite happy, despite all the
faults of the place (Parliament), to be there. It's relatively easy
compared to the pressure I was under when I was leader of Haringey
Council. To some extent, the spotlight has been dimmed.''

<HEAD>Stock Market Malaise Equals Trouble for Newsletter Mavens</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   With the stock market going nowhere, the
investment newsletter business is going under _ at least for awhile.
   Purveyors of tip sheets, investor hotlines and
market-intelligence reports have suffered sharp declines in new
subscriptions in the months since the October crash.
   Several have put their businesses up for sale and others have
stopped publishing because of cancellations and trouble in finding
new customers, especially given the market's apathetic performance
lately.
   To be sure, some well-known newsletters are doing quite well,
especially those that warned subscribers to reduce their stock
exposure prior to the crash. A few have even enjoyed increased
circulation, but the majority are suffering acutely.
   ``Individual investors just aren't interested,'' said Dianne
Chaykin, marketing director for Investment Information Services, a
Chicago-based concern that publishes four newsletters. She said
post-crash response rates to direct-mail solicitations have fallen
by at least 50 percent.
   ``You ask anybody and they'll say renewal rates are the best in
the industry. But you can only live on your renewals for so long,''
she said.
   ``This is not just the summer heat affecting the subscriptions.
This is a bear market. The name of the game right now is to survive
this period.''
   The number of letters is estimated at between 600 and 1,000, but
that appears to be dropping. Diversified Investor's Forecast closed
in July, for example. Investment Information Services itself
recently acquired a California-based mutual-fund advisory service,
Ms. Chaykin said.
   Stan Weinstein, publisher of the highly successful Professional
Tape Reader in Hollywood, Fla., has predicted that a year from now,
``you are going to see far fewer newsletters.''
   To a great extent, the large number of newsletters that were
created over the past few years directly resulted from the historic
bull market that began in 1982 and ended with frightening finality
last October.
   Many relied on direct-mail solicitations to thousands of small
investors eager to participate in what was promoted as an
unprecedented opportunity to profit in stocks. The newsletters did
not take much startup money, either.
   ``In a bull market, anybody with a personal computer and a
stockbroker could start a newsletter,'' Ms. Chaykin said. ``If it's
just you and a secretary, you don't need many subscriptions at a
100 dollars a pop.''
   In that type of environment, garnering customers by mail is
considered the best way to increase circulation. But as a
post-crash strategy it is excessively expensive because few people
respond.
   ``During most of the time, it certainly has paid to do direct
mailing to attract trial subscription, but there have been periods
like now when it becomes inefficient to do so and you hold off,''
said Arnold Kaufman, editor of The Outlook, a newsletter published
by Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York.
   Although the $240-a-year letter is in no danger, Kaufman
expressed concern about prospects for increasing subscriptions, a
direct consequence of when individual investors will find stocks
alluring again.
   ``We're in a somewhat unique situation here. We went through the
largest market decline since the Depression, we just don't know how
this is going to work out,'' he said.
   There have been other bad times for newsletters. Mark Hulbert,
head of Hulbert Financial Digest, a Washington-based publication
that tracks the performance of about 150 newsletters, said the last
downturn was in 1984, before it was clear that Wall Street was in
the midst of a major advance.
   A particularly bad period for the newsletter business came in
1974, another hard year for stocks, Hulbert said.
   ``The irony is that when the market's going up, everybody's
making money and they need a newsletter a lot less,'' he said. ``If
you look at it coolly and rationally, you need a good newsletter
more in a bear market than in a bull market.''
   That certainly has been the case for Weinstein, who correctly
predicted the October break and says he has enjoyed a vast increase
in subscriptions for his $275-a-year newsletter.
   Another beneficiary has been Charles M. LaLoggia, publisher of
Special Situation Report, a Rochester, N.Y. tri-weekly that focuses
on takeover stocks, one of the few profitable areas in the
post-crash market.
   LaLoggia said he had a sharp dropoff in subscriptions to his
$230-a-year newsletter immediately after October but regained them,
partly because of his prescience in picking acquisition targets.
   ``A lot of of people thought the takeover game was dead but I
stuck my neck out and said it wasn't,'' he said.
   LaLoggia said his own theory on newsletters was that they worked
like any other cyclical business: Quality attracts the loyal
customers through bad times and good.
   ``When you have a bull market, you get more newsletters and more
subscribers, but when you have the inevitable shakeout, the ones
that survive are the ones that provide something of value,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   ``I don't like to be reminded I'm getting old. After 25, it's
all downhill.'' _ Leonard Bernstein, 1958.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's gone through life like a volcano, erupting
in a torrent of creative energy as constant as his chain of
cigarettes. And his dramatic bursts and artistic drive have not
abated as he celebrates his 70th birthday.
   Leonard Bernstein, the
composer-conductor-pianist-teacher-television celebrity, will mark
the Aug. 25 birthday with four nights of performances at the
Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts, where he once studied
under the great conductor Serge Koussevitsky.
   ``I haven't slept very much in months,'' the stocky,
white-haired maestro said last week at Tanglewood. ``I have no
further request of the fates except time to write my music. ...
I've got a lot of music to write.''
   Bernstein, who's thrilled millions around the world with his
compositions, his podium pirouettes and his more than 400
recordings, has been active as he approached this milestone year.
From May until December, his schedule listed 63 conducting
performances in 25 cities in 10 countries. Three were in Moscow
last month, his first visit to the country of his parents in 29
years.
   The past year also has seen premieres of two Bernstein
compositions: ``My Twelve Tone Melody,'' for Irving Berlin's 100th
birthday, and ``Jubilee Games,'' to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, with which he has long been
associated.
   A decade ago, Bernstein's energy waned after the death of his
wife, Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and he slipped into
months of depression. But since then, he has divided much of his
time between his homes in New York and Fairfield, Conn., and
Austria, where he has often appeared with the Vienna Philharmonic.
   His life has been as dizzy a balancing act as his emotional
style on the podium: jabs, contortions and leaps that have
occasionally caused him to fall. His style at the podium has been
such a giggle that the music critic Virgil Thomson once said: ``He
shagged, shimmied and, believe it or not, bumped.''
   Bernstein himself has often maintained that conductors should be
actors.
   ``I don't mean that when the music is tragic you've got to act
like Barrymore in `Hamlet.' But you have to indicate to the
orchestra by your body and your face, which is all you've got, what
the shape of the phrase is,'' he said. ``If you don't use a baton,
you work harder, because then your arm has to take its place.''
   Bernstein was a wiry young man of 25, with bony face and dark
wavy hair, when he got the break that helped him become one of
America's titans of classical music.
   On Nov. 14, 1943, he filled in at the last minute for an ailing
Bruno Walter to conduct the New York Philharmonic on a national
radio broadcast. The triumph of the orchestra's newly appointed
assistant conductor was big enough to join the World War II
headlines on the front page of The New York Times.
   ``I had no sleep, no rehearsal, a splitting headache,''
Bernstein recalled in a recent interview with Life. ``I walked on
with an awful hangover and don't remember another thing until I
heard a thunderous ovation.''
   Bernstein has juggled careers as a composer and conductor. His
compositions range from the theatrical (``On the Town,'' ``West
Side Story'') to chamber music.
   In his compositions, as well as his highly acclaimed televised
series of young people's concerts, he skimmed the cream from
classical music and pasteurized it for the American palate.
   ``They write letters to me from the desert, from Montana, from
hundreds of miles off,'' Bernstein once said in an interview with
The Associated Press. ``They've begun to enjoy music. They aren't
scared of it any more. They thought it was too much for them, and
I've helped convince them it isn't.''
   While Bernstein's musical fame grew, his celebrity blossomed.
Media attention really focused when he threw became known as ``that
party at Lenny's'' _ his star-studded fundraiser for the Black
Panthers which was savaged by Tom Wolfe as ``radical chic.''
   Yet he has been shrewd in marketing his career, setting up
Amberson Enterprises in 1969 to manage films, TV specials and
videocasettes of his performances.
   Born in Lawrence, Mass., to a middle-class Russian-Jewish
family, Bernstein got a late start in music. He was 10 when his
Aunt Clara gave the family an upright piano. But he always had an
ear for music, recalled his mother, Jennie, in ``Bernstein: A
Biography'' by Joan Peyser.
   ``When he was 4 or 5, he would play an imaginary piano on his
windowsill,'' Mrs. Bernstein said in the book. ``When we finally
got a piano, he did what he now says he did: made love to it all
the time.''
   His father, Sam, however, hoped young Lenny would join his
beauty supply business. Bernstein persisted with piano lessons. He
went on to study under Walter Piston at Harvard University, and
under Fritz Reiner at the Curtis Institute.

   During his Harvard days, he met conductor Dimitri Mitropoulis,
who recognized his genius and encouraged him to pursue conducting.
He also met Aaron Copland at a 1937 concert. Later that night, at a
party for Copland's 37th birthday, Bernstein impressed the composer
with an impromptu performance without the sheet music of his
difficult ``Piano Variations.''
   With Copland's help, Bernstein, whose greatest works were for
the stage, pursued classical composition. He had written
``Jeremiah,'' the first of his three symphonies, before Artur
Rodzinski appointed him his assistant at the philharmonic in 1943.
   Koussevitzky, the Boston Symphony's influential music director
and founder of Tanglewood, advised his student to pursue classical
music. But Bernstein continued with popular music.
   The year of his philharmonic appointment, he wrote the ballet
``Fancy Free,'' which was a success. The plot, about three sailors'
24-hour shore leave in New York, was adapted for Broadway's ``On
The Town,'' winning five Tony awards.
   Soon to come were his chamber opera ``Trouble in Tahiti,'' the
movie score for ``On the Waterfront,'' Broadway's ``Wonderful
Town'' and ``Candide,'' and the immortal ``West Side Story,'' the
Romeo-and-Juliet tale set amid the fire escapes and street gangs of
Manhattan in the late 1950s.
   Bernstein's successful substitution for Walter also put him in
great demand as a conductor. He left the philharmonic to be guest
conductor at major orchestras, performing in the United States and
abroad. In 1953, he became the first American to conduct at Milan's
famed La Scala opera house, leading diva Maria Callas in
Cherubini's opera ``Medea.''
   In 1957, the year he completed ``West Side Story,'' Bernstein
joined Mitropoulis as co-director of the New York Philharmonic, and
the following year became the orchestra's first American-born
director.
   During his 11-year tenure, Bernstein led the orchestra on tours
of South America, Europe and Asia and on numerous national
television appearances in which he explained classical music to
Americans young and old. His TV appearances, which included the
``Young People's Concerts,'' won 11 Emmy awards.
   Bernstein has had his critics, who over the years called him
overrated as a composer and thrashed his ballet style on the podium.
   ``Bernstein rose vertically, a la Nijinsky, and hovered there a
good 15 seconds,'' The New York Times' critic Harold Schonberg once
wrote.
   But later, on the occasion of Bernstein's 1,000th performance
with the philharmonic, on Dec. 15, 1971, Schonberg wrote: ``At this
time it is only right to put reservations aside and salute
Bernstein for what he did and even for what he tried to do.
Bernstein was a figure that no conductor in history has matched.''
   Among those scheduled to participate at this week's concerts
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra are his son, Alexander, 33, a
teacher, and daughter Nina, a 26-year-old actress. He also has
another daughter, Jaime Thomas, 36, a rock musician and the mother
of Bernstein's only grandchild.
   Others include conductors Seiji Ozawa, John Williams, Michael
Tilson Thomas, and Lauren Bacall, Phyllis Newman, Betty Comden,
Adolph Green, Van Cliburn, Yo-Yo Ma, Elizabeth Taylor, publisher
Malcolm Forbes and Beverly Sills, who will be host. Tickets were
selling for up to $5,000.
   Despite the ado, Bernstein dreads facing his eighth decade.
   ``Everybody is much more excited about this 70th birthday
business than I am,'' he told The Miami Herald in June. ``I'd like
to ignore it.
   ``In fact, that number is just not in my vocabulary. I hate
those pictures of myself with wrinkles, white hair and glasses. I
look like the little old winemaker.''

<TEXT>
   It has been a quarter-century now since a
34-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. stepped to a microphone at the
Lincoln Memorial, the final speaker in a long, hot afternoon.
   Fourteen minutes later, the minister from Atlanta was the
unquestioned king of a movement, a movement that changed America
forever. And his ``I Have a Dream'' speech entered the history
books.
   It was no surprise that King could deliver a rousing sermon or a
speech _ at least no surprise to anyone who had heard him before.
   And it was no accident that he was the last of 10 speakers on
Aug. 28, 1963 _ closing the show, as it were, at the mammoth rally
culminating the March on Washington for civil rights.
   King, introduced by labor leader A. Philip Randolph as ``the
moral leader of the nation,'' had been well known ever since
leading a bus boycott by blacks in segregated Montgomery, Ala., in
1955.
   On that Wednesday afternoon, 200,000 people _ more than any in
the movement had dared hope for _ watched at the memorial. Millions
more watched on television.
   Excited, aware of just what it all meant, King delivered a
speech for the ages, making up the best parts as he went along.
   ``It will be a long time,'' James Reston wrote the next day in
The New York Times, ``before (Washington) forgets the melodious and
melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., crying out
his dreams to the multitude. ... `I have a dream,' he cried, again
and again.''
   That's how it has come to be known: The Dream Speech.
   ``I have a dream,'' King sang. ``I have a dream that one day
this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed: `We hold these truths to be self-evident _ that all men are
created equal.'''
   It was, just about everyone seemed to agree, the greatest part
of a great American oration.
   And it wasn't in the script.
   ``It was something he had done in Detroit a couple of weeks
before,'' recalled Andrew Young, now Atlanta's mayor, then King's
special assistant. ``It was spontaneous in Detroit, and then he
refined it in Washington. It didn't get any publicity in Detroit.''
   King obviously liked the theme, thought it worked well, thought
it said something. But on that Wednesday afternoon, there was not
to be time to say everything he wanted to say. Each of the 10
speakers was limited to eight minutes.
   ``There's no way in the world, Martin, that you can say what
needs to be said in eight minutes,'' aide Walter Fauntroy told him
the day before, as quoted by King biographer Stephen B. Oates.
``They can't limit you _ the spokesman of the movement _ to that,''
said Fauntroy, now the congressional delegate representing the
nation's capital.
   ``But they'll all be mad at me if I speak longer,'' King worried.
   ``Everybody was putting pressure on everybody to be brief,''
Young recalled in an interview last week. ``He was trying to cut
down his speech.''
   The night before, King, Young and other movement leaders
gathered at Washington's Willard Hotel. They exchanged suggestions
for the speech, with King writing it, his secretary typing it and
retyping it, and King scribbling still more changes in the margins.
   ``He stayed up all night,'' Young said. ``You'd look in the
margin and see as many as four or five different words in one
place, where he'd crossed it out, selected another one. He was much
more particular about the language than he'd ever been before.''
   What Young remembers most from that all-night labor of language
is a theme that came early in the speech, contrasting Abraham
Lincoln's emancipation of the black man with the black man's place
in 1963 America.
   ``In a sense,'' King wrote, ``we've come here to our nation's
capital to cash a check ... a promissory note ... a promise that
all men _ yes, black men as well as white men _ would be guaranteed
the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness ...
   ``America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which
has come back marked `insufficient funds.' But we refuse to believe
that the bank of justice is bankrupt.''
   On that Wednesday, King sailed through his speech, through the
bad-check analogy, sticking to his text. But as tens of thousands
clapped and cheered, as his closest aides encouraged him _ ``All
right! Tell it!'' _ he suddenly decided to keep going.
   He remembered what he had said in Detroit, and his eight-minute
speech became 14.
   ``I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the
difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream,'' he
said. ``It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream ... ''
   ``All of that `I had a dream' stuff was straight from the
heart,'' Young said. ``He was passionately involved in the speech.''
   Almost immediately, the speech was acclaimed as a milestone in
the history of a man, a nation and a people.
   ``It may have been historic,'' Atlanta Constitution Editor
Eugene Patterson wrote two days later. ``It may be that this will
be marked down as the date when the civil rights movement grew up.
... It would have been just a large turnout of people who came and
heard predictable things if Martin Luther King had not gotten
carried away by the roars of an electrified crowd.''
   It still electrifies. MPI Home Video of Chicago, which sells the
speech on videotape for $14.95, reports that it's one of the
company's best sellers, with 10,000 sold so far and sales still
going strong.
   Memories of the day will be rekindled on Saturday in a march on
Washington marking the 25 years since the original rally.
   But those closest to King knew back then the power of his words.
``We figured we heard that every time he spoke,'' Young said.
``There was nothing new about his oratory.''
   According to some, he even got better still. Young picks King's
1967 speeches against the Vietnam War as his finest.
   He was at his best, Young said, when he just let it go.
   ``The speeches he gave almost totally from the heart were better
than the speeches he prepared _ or the ones other people tried to
prepare for him,'' Young said.
   ``They were just things he felt real deeply, thought through
very deeply. There was a natural eloquence about him. He would be
eloquent in conversation, just go up on these flights of oratory.''

   Here are excerpts from the speech delivered by Martin Luther
King Jr. on Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington, D.C.:
   I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the
difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a
dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed: ``We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men are created equal.''
   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons
of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream
that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with
the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character.
   I have a dream today!
   I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious
racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words
of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama,
little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands
with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and
brothers. ...
   So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New
Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York;
let freedom ring from the heights of the Alleghenies of
Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of
California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and
molehill in Mississippi _ from every mountainside, let freedom ring.
   And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we
let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state
and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of
God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in
the words of the old Negro spiritual:
   ``Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.''

   An industrial boom is leaving an environmental
mess in many parts of Asia. Burgeoning populations in some
countries make matters even worse.
   A few governments are taking steps to halt the fouling of air
and water, but others are doing little, sacrificing the environment
for economic development.
   ``There is a realization among all these countries that they've
got problems,'' said Bob Keen, principal of the Center for
Environmental Studies at Hong Kong Polytechnic.
   But, he added, whether that realization translates into action
depends on several local factors, including financial resources and
political will.
   The pollution problem is apparent in the region.
   _In Hong Kong, which means ``Fragrant Harbor'' in Chinese, the
stench from some of the local watercourses and harbors _ polluted
by industrial, agricultural and human waste _ is at times
unbearable.
   The government has closed five beaches because of poor water
quality and estimates that 45,000 people suffered infections and
other illnesses last year by swimming at a popular beach on Hong
Kong island's fashionable south side. The beach remains open.
   _In Taiwan, the government Environment Protection Administration
rates seven of 21 main rivers as seriously polluted and describes
the air of the island's two major cities _ traffic-choked Taipei
and Kaohsiung _ as ``unhealthful.''
   _A survey of 58,900 miles of rivers in mainland China found 20
percent polluted and 3,100 miles seriously contaminated. The
government also found severe air pollution in 60 Chinese cities.
   _South Korea, site of the Summer Olympics in September, is
seeing some pollution spinoff from rapid industrial development,
but the problem is being recognized. A $470-million, five-year
government effort to clean up Seoul's Han River apparently has
succeeded, but about 100 farmers recently demonstrated at a zinc
plant in Onsan, outside Seoul, claiming their crops were being
damaged by sulfurous acid.
   Keen explained that pollution control often does not receive
proper attention in the early days of a nation's economic
development.
   ``But as natural history develops, a critical point is reached
where local residents say, `Look, enough. We're not starving any
longer, we won't stand for this rubbish.'''
   Japan was one of the first countries to reach that point as it
led the region in rapid industrialization. After people began dying
from toxic waste that polluted lakes, rivers and the air, the
government decided to take action.
   A decade later, Japan is regaining some control of its
environment, although serious problems remain.
   Pollution concerns appear to have moved to the forefront in the
new generation of Asian economic miracles that includes Hong Kong
and Taiwan.
   Hong Kong's English-language South China Morning Post said in a
June editorial: ``Unless urgent action is taken, it may be too late
to avoid leaving an appalling legacy to future generations. Already
Victoria Harbor, such a spectacular feature of Hong Kong's tourist
image, is one of the world's filthiest stretches of water.''
   Stuart Reed, head of the British colony's Environmental
Protection Department, acknowledged that ``it wasn't until about
three years ago that the resolve of government began to back the
work we were doing.''
   Since Taiwan authorities relaxed martial law last year and
allowed demonstrations, local residents frequently have taken to
the streets to protest the island nation's deteriorating
environment.
   The government budgeted the Taiwan-dollar equivalent of $171
million for the Environment Protection Administration this year,
more than double the 1987 figure.
   In less-developed nations, such as Thailand and the Philippines,
environmental protection is not a major political issue and is
given a low priority.
   It is still not clear how much success clean-up efforts will
achieve.
   Corporations unenthusiastic about expensive environmental
control measures continue to wield plenty of political influence.
   ``The government is weak and companies are strong,'' Tokue
Shibata, former director of Japan's Institute of Environmental
Control, said in a recent interview, voicing sentiments shared by
Hong Kong's environmentalists.
   ``It is ... very difficult to prove a cause and effect with the
new types of pollution,'' Shibata said. ``The government says it is
on business' side unless scientists have direct proof. We can't
prove it, because it takes 10 to 20 years to show up.''
   In Hong Kong, conservationists note that some anti-pollution
regulations have been watered down because of pressure from
industry, while others have not been rigorously enforced.
   ``It's not any good just having the legislation,'' said I.J.
Hodgkiss of the the University of Hong Kong's Department of Botany.
``You have to go in there and do something about it.''

   Here is a look at where major countries in the area stand on
pollution:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JAPAN _ More than 95,000 people are certified as air pollution
victims eligible for compensation. Industrial-waste pollution was
so serious at one time that Japanese names had to be created for a
new generation of diseases.
   One of them, Minamata disease, the most serious, killed more
than 750 people and has been blamed on Chisso Corp., which dumped
mercury into the ocean during the 1950s, contaminating fish. Two
former company officials were found guilty last year of
professional negligence in connection with the dumping.

<TEXT>
   HONG KONG _ The Environmental Protection Department's Stuart
Reed says the colony's main environmental problem is ``too many
people in too small a space'' _ 5.7 million people living in an
area about the size of Boston (population: 570,917). An estimated
95 percent of all dyeing and bleaching factories have illegal
sewage connections.
   The government has started to take action with initiatives that
include legislation to cut agricultural waste and noise pollution.
Reed said annual investment in ``environmental facilities'' will
more than double to the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of about $128
million.

   TAIWAN _ Nearly 20 million people clog the 13,885-square-mile
island (twice the size of Hawaii, population: 1.06 million). They
ride 6 million motorcycles and drive 1.8 million cars.
   The Environment Protection Administration head, Eugene Chien,
maintains that Taiwan's economic growth, which reached a robust 11
percent annual pace in 1987, ``was achieved at the expense of our
environment.''
   But the public and government are beginning to react.
   About 1,000 people marched through Taipei in June to protest a
proposed oil refining plant for their village of Taoyuan.
   The government is undertaking six long-term projects to improve
the environment. One is $1 billion, eight-year effort to clean up
the malodorous Tansui River that runs by Taipei.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH KOREA _ The host country of the Summer Olympics has
industrialzed rapidly in recent years, but has also paid an
environmental price. One of the worst problems was industrial waste
and sewage that polluted the Han River, which through Seoul, the
capital.
   The government put up $470 million in a five-year project
beginning in 1982 to clean the river and fish and birds are
returning. The government recently ordered about 100 industrial
plants and other facilities around Seoul to close down, suspend
operations or take pollution-control measures for not meeting
environmental standards.
   Still, South Korean officials claim the country has no serious
pollution problems and say industrial plants are taking required
measures to control pollution through waste disposal treatment.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SINGAPORE _ Pollution is not a political issue in the tiny
city-state where a tightly run government has taken several steps
to promote hygiene and preserve the environment.
   Singapore has had impressive economic development from 1965 to
1986 without relying on heavy industry, a major source of pollution
elsewhere.
   The Environment Public Health Act of 1987 provides for controls
on toxic waste disposal facilities and the government last year
reduced the allowable lead content in gasoline.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHINA _ Economic development has been the prime concern of Deng
Xiaoping's leadership, with the focus on increasing production
instead of reducing pollution. But the official media recently have
placed more emphasis on pollution problems. Air pollution is as bad
as that suffered by developed country's in the 1950s and 1960s,
according to State Environmental Protection Bureau chief Qu Geping.
   ``China's environmental protection engineering, characterized by
outdated equipment and poor emmission control, lags behind
industrial construction development,'' he wrote in the China
Environmental Journal. ``And this has made the country's pollution
levels go from bad to worse.''
   The government and industry spent about $1.35 billion in yuan
last year to fight pollution, the bureau said, but officials
estimate it would take three times that just to clean up the
teeming city of Shanghai.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THAILAND _ River, air and noise pollution have gradually
worsened in the past decade as Thailand tries to become Asia's next
economic miracle.
   The National Environment Board says the nation has no systematic
waste treatment because of a ``negligible budget.'' Waterways
connected to the major Chao Phraya River that runs through Bangkok
have degenerated into smelly streams. Riverside restaurants and
wooden homes routinely dump garbage into the water.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PHILIPPINES _ Pollution control is not a burning issue in this
country struggling with other serious problems, such as poverty,
political unrest and anti-government guerrilla conflict.
   ``No one is that concerned about pollution,'' said Noel Costelo,
spokesman for the Philippine Environmental Management Bureau.
   Still, Manila is one of Southeast Asia's dirtiest capitals, with
thousands of squatters living in makeshift shanty communities that
dump waste into canals and streams flowing into the Pasig River.
   Exhaust-belching motor vehicles create an eerie, bluish glow
over greater Manila, which is about the size of New York City.
   The government has allocated just $850,000 for the environmental
sector this fiscal year.

   Despite the crop-withering drought in
the United States, European farmers are unlikely to take many new
customers away from Americans in the fiercely competitive export
market, analysts say.
   The United States is expected to draw down on surplus stocks so
that it can continue its export push and hold onto clients.
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department said Thursday in
Washington that about 355 million bushels of government-owned feed
grains have been set aside as a reserve to meet potential demand
for emergency livestock use under the $3.9 billion Drought
Assistance Act.

   Dollar-selling by central banks helped pushed the U.S. currency
down in a day that saw small advances in the stock and bond markets.
   Analysts said the dollar's fall Thursday was limited by a strong
residue of bullish sentiment toward the dollar resulting from
relatively high U.S. interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve was said to have sold dollars to buy West
German marks twice in late trading Thursday in New York, when the
market was thin and more vulnerable to the action. European banks
had sold dollars earlier in the day.
   In addition to the banks' intervention, market watchers said the
dollar was hit by reports that U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Verity said U.S. exports and the world economy as a whole would be
better off if the dollar were trading at 1.8 West German marks. It
is trading around 1.9 marks.
   On Wall Street, a weak advance fizzled Thursday on profit-taking
in another slow trading session. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks closed with a 1.07 gain to 2,027.03. Broader
indices also showed marginal advances.
   ``I think it's just an apathetic market,'' said Peter J.
DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   The bond market strengthened slightly. The yield of the
Treasury's 30-year bond, which moves opposite from prices, fell to
9.40 percent from late Wednesday's 9.41 percent.
   Coffee futures prices rose sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange. Elsewhere, frozen pork belly futures soared the
daily limit.
   Oil futures prices closed mostly higher in moderate trading. On
the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
rose 10 cents a barrel to close at $15.57.

   Oil futures prices have moved higher in moderate
trading as traders maneuvered ahead of the expiration of near-month
contracts.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 10 cents a barrel to close at $15.57 on Thursday.
Other contract months were mixed.
   Most futures prices of oil products traded on the exchange also
rose. Contracts for September delivery of wholesale heating oil
rose 0.22 cent to finish at 44.15 cents a gallon. September
unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 47.28 cents a gallon.
   Analysts attributed most of the rise in the September contract
to last-minute positioning by investors in advance of the closeout
of the contract on Monday.
   ``There is little news to spur the market,'' said Richard Kane,
a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``People are
positioning themselves on the September contract and waiting for
further direction.''
   Traders also were influenced by reports that crude inventories
on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico had declined by 6 million a
week, analysts said.
   ``It's important for the crude market,'' Kane said. ``Prices
firmed off of that.''
   Traders also were watching the gasoline market in anticipation
of some tightening of supplies in the near future, analysts said.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Secures Top Spot Among World Appliance Makers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp.'s plan to acquire a majority
stake in the appliance division of Dutch electronics giant NV
Philips guarantees the company the top slot among appliance makers
around the globe.
   Whirlpool announced Thursday it will pay Philips $470 million
for 53 percent of a joint venture company that will develop,
manufacture and market major appliances under Philips' brand names.
   The new company will employ 14,000 people from the present
Philips division and will have annual sales of about $2 billion,
boosting Whirpool's annual revenue to about $6 billion, the
companies said in a statement.
   Whirlpool, a close second domestically to General Electric Co.,
long has sought to branch out of the relatively mature, $12 billion
U.S. appliance market. The company is affiliated with appliance
concerns in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India but not in the
lucrative European market represented by Philips.
   ``They desperately needed a well-established brand, which
Philips is,'' said Charles Ryan, a first vice president at the
investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co.
   Philips is the world's largest television maker and Europe's
biggest electronics company.
   Whirlpool's move mirrors deals by other manufacturing companies
seeking to rid themselves of weaker businesses and focus on markets
where they can be major players.
   Last year, GE became one of the world's top medical equipment
concerns after swapping its consumer electronics business for
Thomson SA's medical equipment operations. Thomson, in turn,
strengthened its role in consumer electronics.
   Also last year, Philips acquired the 42 percent of North
American Philips Corp. it did not already own to solidify its
strength in the television, lighting, radio and appliance markets
here.
   ``You can't be everything to everybody,'' said Gerrit Jeelof,
executive vice president and vice chairman of the board of
management of Philips.
   Speaking at a press conference here, Jeelof said the Whirlpool
venture would free management resources to concentrate on Philips'
core electronics businesses, such as semiconductors and the coming
generation of high-definition television.
   Last year, Philips discussed a joint venture with Whirlpool and
Britain's General Electric Co., which is unrelated to the U.S.
company of the same name. Those talks fell through because of
uncertain economic conditions following the stock market crash and
a weak dollar.
   ``But they parted very friendly, and this year the dollar has
come back up relative to the (Dutch) guilder, so talks were
reactivated,'' Merrill Lynch's Ryan said.
   Whirlpool will pay Philips $350 million for a 53 percent stake
in the joint venture and $120 million more if the venture continues
beyond three years. Whirlpool has an option to acquire the
remainder of the Philips division, for which it would pay $470
million instead of the $120 million.
   The new company will be based in the Netherlands and will market
washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, stoves, microwave ovens
and dishwashers around the world, but primarily in Europe.
Appliances will be sold under the Philips, Bauknecht and Ignis
brand names.
   Whirlpool could take advantage of Philips' expertise in
convection cooking and gas cooking, while the European joint
venture could benefit from Whirlpool's strength in products such as
dishwashers, air conditioners and clothes dryers that are beginning
to catch on in Europe, said David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   Whirlpool stock rose 12{ cents to $25.75 a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., manufactures and
markets a range of home appliances under the Whirlpool, Kitchenaid
and Roper brand names. The company, which employs about 31,000
people and has annual sales of about $4.2 billion, also is a major
supplier to Sears, Roebuck & Co. of Kenmore products.
   The joint venture is the latest in a string of consolidations in
the appliance industry.
   Earlier this year Whirlpool engaged in a bidding war with GE
over the appliance maker Roper Corp. GE ultimately acquired Roper
and its manufacturing facilities, but Whirlpool struck a deal to
gain the Roper brand name.
   Other major appliance mergers in recent years include Maytag
Corp.'s acquisition of Magic Chef Co. and the acquisition of White
Consolidated Industries by Sweden's Electrolux AB.
   Last month Philips announced its profit fell 44 percent in the
second quarter, an unexpectedly poor performance that the company
blamed on an onslaught of competition from Southeast Asia and
losses on foreign currencies.
   Philips hinted then that it was about to take a major step to
raise cash, such as a big joint venture or sale of a large part of
the company.
   Philips, whose annual sales have topped $25 billion, has been
cutting costs at its European factories and moving more production
to lower-cost areas, including the United States. In the past seven
months it has laid off 6,000 European employees and has promised at
least 4,000 more cuts.

<TEXT>
   A federal regulator says the consolidation of
12 insolvent Texas thrifts in a single $1.3 billion deal signals
the things to come in Texas and elsewhere as the government tries
to clean up the battered thrift industry.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
declined on Thursday to specify when the next consolidation would
take place. But he indicated about half of an estimated 200
insolvent thrift cases currently in various states of negotiation,
bidding and marketing may be resolved by the end of the year.
   Earlier in the week, bank board member Roger Martin said that by
the end of August 35 insolvent thrifts would be dealt with under
the so-called Southwest Plan to consolidate and recapitalize ailing
thrifts in the region.
   Wall's comments came as regulators announced the government
would spend $1.3 billion to assist the acquisition of 12 failed
thrifts by an investor group led by Chicago banker William Gibson.
   The transaction, the fourth consolidation under the Southwest
Plan, was the biggest single such deal to date and doubled the
number of Texas thrifts to be merged since the first transaction in
May.
   ``While we're focusing a lot of attention on the state of Texas,
because of the concentration of the problem within the industry in
that state, we continue to work elsewhere,'' Wall said.
   The consolidation brings to 68 the number of mergers,
consolidations and ``insurance actions'' approved nationwide so far
this year. Wall said the number was ``ahead of what we had
established as a minimum goal so far this year and that ratio, that
average per week, would only continue to increase as we move toward
the end of the year.''
   The action accounts for 24 of the 109 Texas thrifts that were
insolvent when work on the Southwest Plan began earlier this year,
``and we plan to complete the work in Texas by the end of May
1989,'' Wall said.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will provide an
immediate $499 million note to fund the new consolidation, with the
money going to boost capital and help cover bad loans. Outside
investors will inject $48 million.
   Gibson, executive vice president of Continential Illinois
National Bank and Trust in Chicago and Continental Illinois Corp.,
will serve as president and chief executive officer of the new
institution.
   Gibson is a former senior vice president at First RepublicBank
Corp. of Dallas. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. bailed out
First RepublicBank in July when it pledged $4 billion to help NCNB
Corp. Charlotte, N.C., take over the troubled banking giant.
   The new Dallas-based thrift will be called American Federal Bank
F.S.B. It has more than 50 branches in Texas, but it was not
immediately known how many would be closed.
   The bank board, regulator of the thrift industry, said the 12
thrifts had combined assets of nearly $2.4 billion and liabilities
of $3 billion.
   FHLBB officials said the 12 thrifts were losing a combined $105
million a quarter. One of the merged thrifts, Richardson Savings
and Loan Association of Dallas, had a $77.6 million loss in the
first quarter of 1988, the 10th worst earnings record nationally
among thrifts.
   Two other thrifts, Mercury Savings Association, Wichita Falls,
and Ben Milam Savings and Loan, Cameron, were in the bank board's
management consignment program, which replaces the management of
ailing thrifts with those from healthy ones.
   The acquisition was the first involving capital from outside the
thrift industry, Wall said.
   ``Today's transaction shows that private investors are willing
to bring in hard cash for the opportunity of participating in the
Texas thrift recovery,'' he said.
   Wall said the end of the federal fiscal year, Sept. 30, and the
end of the calendar year, are helping drive the bank board forward.
A tax exemption involving FSLIC-assisted transactions is scheduled
to be phased out Dec. 31, Wall said.
   The thrift industry continues to lose capital, although the
decline apparently slowed down in the last quarter, and officials
have put the cost of restoring health to the industry anywhere from
$26 million to $100 million as debate continues on Capitol Hill
over whether a taxpayer bailout will face the next president after
he takes office in January.
   The FHLBB reported earlier this month that the industry's
capital declined by $1.72 billion in the April-June period,
compared with a drop of $3.51 billion in the first quarter and
$4.68 billion the last three months of 1987.

<HEAD>Businessman, Banker Invest $48 Million In Savings And Loan Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1.3 billion federally-assisted merger of 12
troubled savings and loan associations demonstrates investor faith
in Texas and in the recovery of the thrift industry, according to a
Dallas businessman involved in the buyout.
   Lone Star Technologies Financial Service Corp., a subsidiary of
Lone Star Technologies Inc. of Dallas, and an investor group headed
by Chicago banker William E. Gibson have agreed to pay $48 million
for the thrifts, in a deal announced Thursday.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is providing a $499
million note immediately to restore positive net worth to the
merged thrifts, and could spend a total of $1.3 billion in the
transaction.
   ``We're very enthusiastic about this innovative transaction
because we believe it helps to solve the Texas savings and loan
problem,'' said William Howard Beasley III, chairman and chief
executive officer of Lone Star Technologies.
   ``It demonstrated our faith in the institutions, in the future
of Texas and in the thrift industry as a whole,'' Beasley said.
   Lone Star and the Gibson group are the first investors from
outside the savings and loan industry to participate in a buyout
under the so-called Southwest Plan for aiding the region's thrift
industry, said Mary A. Creedon, deputy executive director of the
FSLIC.
   The thrifts were placed under receivership and combined to form
the new institution of American Federal Bank F.S.B.
   Gibson, an executive vice president with Continental Illinois
National Bank and Trust Co. in Chicago, will return to Dallas to
head the newly formed institution.
   He said his group had been considering investment in the Texas
industry long before formation of the Southwest Plan, a Federal
Home Loan Bank Board program in which regulators plan to merge or
close more than 100 of the 279 thrifts that operated in Texas on
Jan. 1. With Thursday's transaction, 24 have cases have been
resolved in Texas.
   The Gibson group ``took a look at what was going on in Texas and
what was going on in the thrift business and just felt that a new
approach was in order,'' Gibson said.
   ``There was an awful lot that was good about Texas and about the
thrift business but both had their problems. We just felt there was
some room for some new blood some new approaches, some new
expertise.''
   Gibson is a former senior vice president of RepublicBank Corp.
of Dallas. He and Beasley have a nearly 20-year friendship dating
back to their association in Washington. Beasley once served as a
special assistant to Secretary of the Treasury and Gibson served as
a special assistant to the Council of Economic Advisers.
   Gibson said he felt comfortable returning to Texas despite its
shaky economy and the shaky financial condition of the savings and
loan industry.
   ``We're going to be making loans, making loans sensibly. We're
not going to make acquisition, development or construction loans.
We're going to have more sound business practices.''
   Ms. Creedon said a large number of depositors, possibly more
than 100,000, would be affected by the transaction. But she said
all deposits, insured and uninsured would transfer to the newly
formed institution.

<HEAD>Mainframe Computers Make Sweet Music With New Software</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mainframe computers can write musical harmonies
in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach by using new software created
by a researcher-composer at International Business Machines Corp.
   Kemal Ebcioglu said Thursday he created the software to help
understand Bach's style more precisely _ and to help explore the
frontiers of computer science.
   The musical work led to the creation of a programming language
that could be adapted for other jobs requiring heavy computation,
such as deciphering the molecular structure of genes, Ebcioglu said.
   Although other computer programs can be used to compose music,
the IBM software is the only one to duplicate the Bach chorale
styles, Ebcioglu said.
   The program, called Choral, adds bass, tenor and alto parts to
chorale melodies that are written for soprano. It is not intended
as a commercial product because of its limited usefulness and its
huge appetite for computing power.
   Ebcioglu, who holds a master's degree in music and a doctorate
in computer science, said the software uses more than 350
compositional rules that he programmed into it based on years of
study of Bach's chorales.
   A chorale harmonization of 20 bars requires about 30 minutes of
computing time and 23 billion simple instructions on one of IBM's
giant 3090 series of mainframe computers, a measure of the
complexity of Bach's music.
   Choral would probably receive an above-average to excellent
grade in a college composition class, said Ebcioglu.
   ``It is unknown to what degree we can replicate human creativity
by a computer. But what we can do is impose much higher standards
on computer-created music,'' said Ebcioglu.
   Choral builds a harmonization stage by stage. It backtracks and
changes notes that it considers to be responsible for a dead-end
when the dead-end is encountered. In that way, it resembles an
animal negotiating a maze.
   Many kinds of scientific research involve similar searches.
Ebcioglu's new programming language, Backtracking Specification
Language, simplifies the search process.
   Bach's chorale style was relatively easy to replicate because it
is well-understood, Ebcioglu said. He said other natural candidates
for expert systems programs would be Antonio Vivaldi and Franz
Joseph Haydn.
   Compositional rules by themselves cannot produce beautiful
music, Ebcioglu said. Composers use additional knowledge _ talent _
for choosing among the many theoretically possible extensions of a
particular composition.
   Ebcioglu said he came up with a good approximation of talent by
building a large number of precise guidelines based on an
understanding of Bach's style.
   Ebcioglu works at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

<HEAD>State Court Judge Overturns 39-Year-Old Ban On Self-Service Gas
Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS G. KATSARELAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge who struck down New Jersey's
39-year-old law banning self-service gas stations has given state
lawmakers six months to enact regulations complying with his
decision.
   Superior Court Judge Martin L. Haines of Mount Holly ruled the
safety considerations that originally prompted passage of the law
in 1949 no longer were valid, and that the law violated the state
constitution's limits on the Legislature's police power.
   In doing so, the judge went against a 1952 state Supreme Court
ruling upholding the law. But he contended the facts of the issue
had changed since then, thus allowing him to break with precedent.
   ``The testimony before me revealed very different facts _
self-service stations are at least as safe as full-service
stations,'' Haines said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   Self-service station proponents praised the decision, made
public Thursday but issued to attorneys on Wednesday.
   ``We see it as a victory for consumer freedom of choice,'' said
John F. Holtz, associate director of the New Jersey Petroleum
Council, which represents the state's largest oil companies.
   But Jerry Ferrara, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline
Retailer's Association and Allied Trades Inc., which represents
about 3,000 New Jersey service stations, said he was disappointed.
   Ferrara said legalizing self-service would not bring any cost
benefits to motorists, would prompt gasoline stations to lay off
workers and would turn many service stations into gas-only
stations, closing their repair shops.
   New Jersey and Oregon are the only two states that still
prohibit self-service stations.
   Haines' ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Kirschner Brothers Oil
Co. Inc. of Haverford, Pa., against the state Department of Labor.
The company, which owns about 20 service stations in New Jersey,
claimed the law was antiquated and that customers should have a
choice between self- and full-service.
   Proponents of self-service also say it could help drive down
costs at the pump by decreasing labor expenses.
   Proposals to legalize self-service pumps are pending before the
Law and Public Safety Committees in both the Senate and Assembly.
   The law was enacted by legislators who expressed concern that
motorists were endangered by pumping their own gas. Opponents of
self-service stations still back their arguments with newspaper
reports of fires and other accidents that have injured or killed
motorists who were trying to pump their own gas.
   Opponents also say the change would increase profits of gasoline
companies. The labor department has lobbied against changing the
law.
   The state Supreme Court affirmed the statute in 1952. Haines
ruled June 29 that he could not overturn a law affirmed by a higher
court, but reconsidered when asked by Kirschner.
   Haines decided safety no longer was an issue, allowing him to
reverse his earlier ruling and break with precedent.
   The state attorney general's office, which represented the Labor
Department, has not decided whether to appeal the decision, said
spokeswoman Becky Taylor.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower In Thin, Erratic Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell slightly in thin, erratic trading
in Europe today with market players unsure about the currency's
next direction.
   Gold prices drifted higher in quiet trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Italy said enthusiasm for the dollar
waned, especially after concerted intervention by major central
banks on Thursday, which pushed the U.S. currency lower.
   Dealers said they didn't expect the dollar to make any major
moves.
   ``Given (higher U.S.) interest rates, whoever has dollars will
hold onto them,'' said one trader in Milan.
   In Frankfurt, some dealers predicted the dollar will recover
quickly, but others said the market must still consider the
possibility of another round of central bank intervention.
   ``It's not at all clear where the dollar will move now,'' said a
trader at a major West German bank.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 133.40 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8945 West German marks, down from 1.8980; 1.5930
Swiss francs, down from 1.5955; 6.4243 French francs, down from
6.4340; 2.1350 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1438; 1,403.55 Italian
lire, up from 1,402.75; 1.2270 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2298.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7030 from $1.6989 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $431.30 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $432.40. Both were up from Thursday's late bid
of $431.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $432.50, up from $431.00 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.93 to close at a bid $434.21.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.68 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $6.66.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
firmer at the end of the trading week today, while the U.S. dollar
lost ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 49.50-point
loser Thursday, bounced back to gain 80.06 points, or 0.28 percent,
closing the day at 28,209.42.
   Volume traded on the first section was an estimated 1 billion
shares, up by 250 million shares from the previous day's session.
   ``Volume came back to its normal level after thin trading
earlier this week, but share prices have been moving very little
because the market is lacking specific direction even though it's
stable,'' said an analyst with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``Dealers are now searching for what to buy, and they're unable
to decide on any one thing,'' said the analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Among the winners in today's trading were steels, heavy machine
and real estate issues.
   After opening lower, the dollar continued to decline and ended
the day at 133.40 yen, down 0.53 yen. The currency was traded
between 133.15 yen and 133.50, down from Thursday's range of
133.73-134.10 yen.
   An exchange dealer at a bank in Tokyo attributed the lower
dollar to a ``wait-and-see mood'' prevailing in the market.
   The stock and foreign exchange markets will be closed in Tokyo
Saturday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is closed on the second and
third Saturday of each month and there are no foreign exchange
dealings on Saturday.

<HEAD>Roy Rogers Pulls Ad After School Food Workers Complain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School cafeteria workers got results after
complaining about a Roy Rogers commercial that depicted them
foisting unpleasant-looking food on students, with a warning that
school was imminent.
   The Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott Corp., which owns the chain of
stores purveying roast beef sandwiches, fried chicken and
hamburgers, said Thursday it would pull the TV ad.
   But it maintained that the spot was misunderstood _ it was
supposed to be a spoof of the way school cafeterias were years ago.
   ``Marriott has over 65,000 employees that work in cafeterias,
and the last thing we're going to do is try and offend somebody,''
said Marriott spokesman Rick Sneed.
   Charles Hughes, president of Local 372 of the State, County and
Municipal Workers, AFL-CIO, which represents more than 8,000 school
cafeteria workers, had called the commercial ``despicable.''
   ``I think they've stooped to a new low by advocating that
children ought to eat junk food on a daily basis,'' Hughes said.
   The commercial starts with the tune, ``See You in September,''
and shows a series of cafeteria workers holding trays of
unappealing food close to the camera. An announcer intones that
students have only a few weeks left to eat at Roy Rogers before the
fall term begins.
   ``The ad very clearly sends a message that one of the things you
ought to be dreading as Labor Day approaches is a return to the
school cafeteria,'' said City Councilwoman Ruth Messinger.
   The ad began airing about 10 days ago and was to run until Sept.
9, but Sneed said, ``It's our intent to pull it as soon as we can.
It will not run its full course.''
   He said the company got calls from food service managers
complaining that ``that's not the way cafeteria workers look now
and it's also not the type of food served now _ macaroni and
cheese, sandwiches and so forth.''

<HEAD>Ohio GOP Cartoonist Gets Boot For Work Resembling `Shoe'
Cartoonist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cartoonist for the Ohio Republican Party
was fired after disclosure that some of his cartoons closely
resembled Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jeff MacNelly's work.
   Ed Wilson, the cartoonist, was dismissed after a meeting by
state GOP officials who attended the Republican National Convention
in New Orleans. He was hired six weeks ago to draw cartoons
lampooning Democrats.
   ``Mr. Wilson has been dismissed, and an appropriate apology will
be forthcoming to Jeff MacNelly and his syndicate,'' Ohio
Republican Chairman Robert Bennett said Thursday night.
   The Dayton Daily News reported Thursday that several of Wilson's
cartoons are strikingly similar to those drawn by MacNelly, who
works for the Chicago Tribune.
   In his subsequent statement, Bennett said, ``It is clear that
some of Mr. Wilson's drawings are too similar to drawings by
another artist.''
   Dave Garick, the state party's communications director, said
Ohio GOP officials were disappointed over the incident because they
thought Wilson had a promising career.
   Neither Wilson nor MacNelly immediately responded to the firing.
Wilson had said earlier that the similarities are coincidental.
MacNelly had said he was considering turning the matter over to an
attorney.
   The Daily News reported that four cartoons drawn by Wilson for
the Ohio GOP are virtually the same as the MacNelly drawings,
except that the political figures have been changed to reflect
current politics. In two others, the artwork is strikingly similar,
but the subject matter is different, the newspaper said.
   One of MacNelly's cartoons shows President Jimmy Carter standing
in a trash can while he speaks at a podium. An adviser is saying,
``No. No. No. Stand ON your record not IN it. Now you've got it all
over your suit.''
   Wilson's cartoon features Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee, also standing in a trash can
behind a podium. A voice from the auditorium is saying, ``No. No.
No. Stand ON your record. Not IN it.''
   MacNelly has won three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning.
His cartoons are syndicated by the Tribune Syndicate Co. and were
published in his 1984 book, ``Directions.'' He also draws the
syndicated comic strip, ``Shoe.''
   In the time he worked for the Ohio GOP, Wilson drew about 30
cartoons that were attached to news releases and, on at least two
occasions, handed out to the public.
   The similarities were found by Daily News staff artist Randy
Palmer, who saw some of Wilson's cartoons last weekend and compared
them with panels he saw in MacNelly's book, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Club Members Strip to Swim in Protest of Court Coed Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Male members of the San Francisco Press
Club are defying a judge's order to give female members the same
access to an indoor pool by continuing to swim in the nude.
   Before the ruling a month ago, the Press Club allowed men to use
the pool daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., but women were limited to two
hours on Thursday and four on Sunday. About 180 of the club's 1,800
members are women.
   A female club member filed a discrimination suit against the
club, prompting Superior Court Judge Maxine Chesney to order it to
immediately end its practice of restricting the hours female
members could use the pool and locker room.
   Despite her victory in court, Irene Vacchina, a Press Club
member since 1979, said locker room attendants still tell her she
can't go in when the men are there.
   ``I feel cheated and hurt by the club. It is illegal for them to
take my money and then give me unequal treatment,'' she said. Dues
are $780 a year.
   The club's acting manager, Joyce Cirimelli, said she has posted
a copy of the judge's ruling in the pool area and a notice saying
that members who want to swim must wear bathing suits, but many men
are still swimming in the buff.
   The men ``act like it's their kingdom down there,'' she said.
   Vacchina's lawyer, Kathy Mount, said the club could have avoided
the problem if it had chosen a different way to comply with the
order. Instead of opening the pool to both sexes, the club could
have let women and men use the pool the same number of hours but on
different days.
   Press Club members who disobey the ruling can be found in
contempt of court and fined or jailed, Mount said.

   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari
Thursday pledged to institute agricultural credit reforms as part
of an overhaul of federal farm policy.
   Salinas, the victor in the contested July 6 presidential
elections, said his administration will give peasant farmers
credits in cash rather than in in-kind goods.
   He also pledged to create communal retail outlets for peasant
crops and eliminate the need for peasant farmers to market their
goods through middlemen.
   ``Justice, Production and Productivity'' mark the three central
themes of the next administration's farm policy, Salinas said.
   The president-elect takes office Dec. 1.
   Salinas made his comments in chairing the inaugural session of
an agricultural policy study group sponsored by the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party.

   Two Commerce Department officials warned
Thursday the government was ready to slap fines, revoke business
licenses and issue arrest warrants for those retailers found
violating pricing policies under the second phase of an
anti-inflation program.
   Victor Campos Chargoy and Efren Ocampo Lopez, directors of the
department's price inspections and vigilance division, said the
government could bring fines of more than $40,000 and close
businesses up to three months for violations of official price
guidelines under the Economic Solidarity Pact.
   The government announced Aug. 14 it was extending the program to
Nov. 30. The pact has frozen wages, the peso currency exchange rate
and prices for government-regulated goods and services.
   The national sales tax for essential foods and medicines, as
well as on rents, will be lowered as part of the pact's second
stage, the government announced.
   The Economic Solidarity Pact was unveiled in December as
inflation soared to a record 159.2 percent last year. On Aug. 10,
the central bank announced the pact had succeeded in bringing
consumer prices down to a 1.7 percent increase in July, the lowest
monthly rise in seven years.

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. has decided to stick to
producing and not serving food and has ended its 15-year stint in
the restaurant business.
   The Camden-based firm has agreed to sell its chain of
Annabelle's eateries for an undisclosed amount to Cavendish Capital
Corp. of New York.
   ``We are primarily a manufacturer of food,'' Campbell spokesman
James Moran said Thursday. ``We decided to put our resources and
efforts back into what we do best.''
   The sale of the 16-unit chain is subject to the buyer obtaining
financing, Moran said. The sale should be completed by
mid-September, he said.
   Annabelle's, a Campbell operation since 1983, had revenues of
$19 million last year. The chain operates in the Carolinas,
Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Campbell entered the restaurant business in 1973 with a chain of
Hanover Trail steakhouses and converted some in the early 1980s to
H.T. McDoogal's eateries. The company closed its last McDoogal's in
1986.
   In April, the firm sold a 65-unit Pietro's pizza shop chain,
which is located primarily in the northwest.

   Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 4.8
percent in July from 4.6 percent in the previous month, the
government reported Friday.
   The retail price index rose 0.1 percent in July after a 0.4
percent rise in June, the Department of Employment said.
   The retail price index, which uses a January 1987 basis of 100,
stood at 106.7 in July, up from 106.6 in June, and up from 101.8 in
July 1987.
   The latest rise in the index was mainly due to higher prices for
cars, insurance, non-seasonal foods, electricity and gas, the
department said.
   As is usual for the season, prices for fresh food and clothing
were lower, it said.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Forecast To Remain Weak, OPEC's Output Share Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices are expected to remain at their present
low levels through the early 1990s, according to a study published
Friday by analysts of Business International, a Geneva-based
consulting firm.
   Oil prices will start to recover when members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially the
Middle East producers, recover some of the world market share that
they began losing to non-OPEC members in the early 1980s, the study
said.
   OPEC's output will increase to 21.4 million barrels a day in
1992 from an estimated 18.4 million this year, the study said.
   The current self-imposed ceiling on the output of 12 of the OPEC
members is 15.06 million barrels a day, although the countries have
been exceeding their quotas. Iraq, the 13th member, has refused to
join in the quota sharing program since 1986.
   ``Oil prices will remain at their current weak levels,'' a
summary of the study said. ``This will undermine revenues and
increased indebtedness in parts of the region.''
   In spite of weak oil prices, the annual economic growth of the
six major economies in the region, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria,
Iran, Iraq, Turkey, was predicted to average 2.7 percent during
1988-1992, as compared with 0.5 percent during the five preceding
years.
   The study warned Western companies doing business in the Middle
East to brace for tough conditions in the next few years, but said
it expected a recovery after 1990.
   ``Market conditions will become increasingly favorable to
initiatives by foreign investors and the private sector,'' it
added. ``In all the countries, liberalization policies will open
new avenues for local and foreign investors.''
   The study said that no solutions were expected for the long-term
regional political conflicts. Even a formal cease-fire in the Gulf
war ``is not expected to reduce the level of militarization of the
Iran-Iraq border or of the Gulf as a whole,'' it added.

<HEAD>Davis Pumps Millions Into Bank To Keep It Out of Trouble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Marvin Davis transferred $8.3 million
into Metro National Bank of Denver to meet minimum federal
standards and to prevent the bank's failure.
   ``With this additional capital, the bank will continue serving
its depositors and, at the same time, have the opportunity to
develop a long-term program, responsive to the needs of the Denver
business community,'' Davis said in a prepared statement after
transferring the money on Thursday.
   Davis, the primary owner of the $77 million bank in Denver's
17th Street financial district, made the contribution to Metro's
capital just after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. held an
auction for the bank, in which the FDIC tried to find a buyer for
the bank.
   The infusion of capital brings the bank's capital-to-assets
ratio to 7 percent, the minimum required by regulations, and
boosted Davis' contributions to Metro to $32 million, a spokesman
said.
   Davis, who divides his time between Los Angeles and Denver, has
bailed the bank out of problems before.
   The bank has been hit hard by energy, real estate and penny
stock-related loans. It was on the brink of insolvency last month
after the Colorado Supreme Court refused to strike a $940,000
judgment against the bank in a case involving a defunct penny stock
brokerage, regulators said.
   On March 31, Metro's capital had fallen to 1.64 percent of
assets, after the bank lost $610,000 during the first three months
of the year. It lost $12.9 million in 1987, according to Sheshunoff
Information Services Inc.
   Problem loans totaled $11.3 million, or more than 20 percent of
the bank's total loan portfolio, officials said.
   The bank's problems have forced officials to reduce its size by
more than 50 percent since 1984, when it had $181 million in assets.

<TEXT>
   In a city which has experienced a slump in the
real estate market, one homeowner is asking $35 million for his
house, and the royal price is in keeping with the resident.
   The sales agent boasts that the house, owned by Prince Abdul
Faisal of Saudi Arabia, may be ``the world's most expensive listed
residence.''
   Faisal had the home built only four years ago in the fashionable
River Oaks neighborhood.
   ``I think the reason he's selling it is because he doesn't ever
use it,'' said Realtor Marilyn Hoffman of Dallas.
   She said that, although the asking price is steep, ``the house
is worth it. It's just a palace.''
   Tax records show the house has 22,400 square feet of space
divided into 20 rooms, 10 of them bedrooms. There are 10 baths,
five half-baths, three recreation rooms and three wood-burning
fireplaces.
   One of the recreation rooms is a gymnasium, Ms. Hoffman said.
   She said the exterior is covered in imported white French
limestone. Amenities include gold-plated bathroom fixtures, carved
marble switchplates and a computerized air-conditioning system.
   Ms. Hoffman said the brass and beveled glass front doors alone
cost more than $100,000.
   The house sits on a three-acre site. Its grounds feature a 60-by
22-foot swimming pool with a bathhouse, tax records show.
   The Harris County Appraisal District lists the house's value at
only $7.7 million. The 1987 tax bill on the house totaled $132,000.
   Faisal's Alfanco Inc. was a minority partner in Heritage Plaza,
a 53-story downtown office building completed in 1986 but still 90
percent vacant. Faisal since has sold his interest in the building.
   Just this week, MCO Plaza, a 22-story building Alfanco built
near the Galleria in west Houston, was posted for foreclosure.
   Some experts are skeptical about the asking price of Faisal's
home. One residence in River Oaks sold for $5.5 million five years
ago, and ``nothing has sold for more than that,'' said Robin
Elverson, a veteran Realtor.
   The previous high list price was $16 million in 1982, and that
house now lists for $9.5 million, according to Dick Lewis of George
Murray & Co.
   Still, Martha Turner of Martha Turner Properites Inc. said
value, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
   ``Is the house worth $35 million to you?'' she said. ``I hope
they get $35 million.''
   To sell the property, Ms. Hoffman is counting on a buyer from
overseas. ``We have a Japanese man coming to look at it,'' Ms.
Hoffman said.

<HEAD>Bearings Plant To Cut Work Force By 550</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Motors Corp. unit plans to lay
off about 550 workers at its plant here and move its spindle
bearing operations to Ohio, officials of New Departure-Hyatt
Bearings said.
   When the move is completed, about 500 workers will remain at the
bearing manufacturing plant in Bristol, where 3,500 people worked
just 10 years ago, company officals said Thursday.
   The GM subsidiary, which recently phased out 675 jobs after
eliminating production of commercial bearings, also may sell its
plant here and seek a smaller site, Mayor John J. Leone said.
   The move to Sandusky, Ohio, was ``purely a business decision,''
said Jerome Bishop, director of media relatins at the components
division. He said the two plants in Sandusky and Bristol gave the
company 40 percent more space than it needed to run the separate
spindle bearing operations.
   Bishop said there was no guarantee the company, celebrating its
100th anniversary in Bristol this year, would stay in Connecticut.
   ``We're in an extremely competitive worldwide market and we must
remain competitive with all our product lines,'' he said.
   Bishop said 130 of the 330 workers in the spindle bearings
operation will be offered jobs in Sandusky. The other 200 workers
will be offered a cash settlement, early retirement or placed in a
company job bank, which pays workers their full salaries to remain
available for spot duty.
   New Departure's decision to move some operations is another blow
to an industry beleagured both in Connecticut and in the United
States.
   The International Trade Commission reported to Congress earlier
this month that international competition, declining profits and
decreasing investment have dangerously weakened the industry.
   In Connecticut, the bearings industry employed 16,000 people in
the mid-1960s, but that number dropped to just 7,600 by 1984.

   The stock market opened slightly higher this
morning in slow trading, echoing a trendless pattern that has
affected Wall Street all week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 9.42 points
to 2,036.45 by 10 a.m. EDT.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.51 to 148.32. The
American Stock Exchange market-value index rose 0.27 to 295.23.
   Gaining issues outnumbered advances by more than a 5-to-3 margin
on the NYSE, with 574 up, 296 down and 441 unchanged. Volume
totaled 15.12 million shares after the first 30 minutes.
   Stock analysts said they did not expect a significant move
either way in prices today, attributing the sluggishness to the
lack of economic news and an underlying investor apathy about the
market.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 1.07 points to
2,027.03.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about a 7-to-6 margin
in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 740 issues up,
644 down and 587 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 139.82 million shares, vs. 169.50

<HEAD>Newspapers Contend With JOA Reversal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While attorneys considered what to do about an
order holding off a joint operating agreement between The Detroit
News and Detroit Free Press, laid-off employees reoccupied the
desks they had just vacated.
   Workers expressed confusion and resignation at the holdup of the
agreement scheduled to take effect Thursday.
   Some, like artist Annie Lazurek, who had been laid off Wednesday
after 22 years at the Free Press, said they were returning to
protect severance benefits.
   ``What choice do I have?'' Lazurek asked.
   A temporary restraining order late Wednesday by U.S. District
Judge Joyce Hens Green halted the joint operating agreement granted
by Attorney General Edwin Meese III before he left office last week.
   That blocks the merger at least until a Sept. 8 hearing.
   The Detroit Newspaper Agency, which was to begin handling the
combined functions of the two papers Thursday, remained in limbo
and executives scrambled to put back together the separate
operations they had dismantled.
   Newspaper attorneys haven't decided how to respond to Green's
order, said William Keating, chief executive of the agency.
   ``It's unbelievable. My desk is cleared except for one pen,''
said Tom Szczepanski, a Free Press account executive who would have
reported to the same job in a different location under the JOA.
   Robert DeCooman, 60, had accepted early retirement and had seen
his son laid off Wednesday after 16 years with the News.
   The two, among an estimated 500 people at the News and Free
Press whose positions would be eliminated under a JOA, thought they
had left the newspaper for the last time, only to be notified to
return to work Thursday.
   ``This is terrible,'' DeCooman said. ``I'm so sick of this
because the last two years of my life have been absolutely nothing
but turmoil.''
   ``It's like an emotional roller coaster,'' said his son, Richard
DeCooman. ``If I refuse to come back, where does that leave me?''
   Free Press General Manager Robert J. Hall said Wednesday was
``one of the worst days of my life.''
   ``The employees of the Free Press have lived under uncertainty
and on an emotional roller coaster for the past 28 months,'' Hall
said. ``And to put this on top of all that is more than most people
should be called on to endure.''
   The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and the News, owned
by Gannett Co. Inc., asked the U.S. Justice Department in 1986 for
a limited antitrust exemption to allow the JOA, citing substantial
losses at both papers and saying the Free Press probably would fail
without the arrangement.
   Opponents such as Detroit Mayor Coleman Young and unions
representing the newspaper employees dropped their opposition after
Knight-Ridder said earlier this year that it would close the Free
Press if a JOA were denied.
   The new ruling came in a suit filed by a group of newspaper
readers and advertisers called Michigan Citizens for an Independent
Press.
   ``Where were they two and a half years ago, or even six months
ago?'' asked Lucy Page, a classified advertising sales
representative at the News.
   Page said she had first been happy because she was to keep her
job under the JOA. ``But then I went out and saw all the people who
were getting moved and all, and by the end of the day I just
couldn't be happy.''
   Bringing the new suit were state Sen. John Kelly, D-Detroit; W.
Edward Wendover, publisher of the Plymouth-Canton Community Crier;
former Detroit News gossip columnist Matt Beer; a former News
circulation employee, William Cowan; David Kersh, president of
Metro Publications Inc., and Murray Greenhalge, a Free Press
printer.
   They were represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group, a
Washington-based organization founded by Ralph Nader.
   Kelly said the group sought closer scrutiny ``of something that
would have a 100-year monopoly than the legal review given it by
Mr. Meese.''

<HEAD>Polaroid Urges Voluntary Retirements in Move to Fight Hostile
Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp., seeking to elude a
hostile takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc., has raised to 1,500 the
number of employees it wants to retire voluntarily in an effort to
consolidate resources.
   Company officials have also warned employees that layoffs could
occur if the payroll-trimming goal is not met.
   The threat of forced layoffs was made Wednesday in a speech
delivered to Polaroid's highest-ranking executives by chief
executive officer I. MacAllister Booth and replayed on videotape
Thursday before hundreds of marketing employees meeting in
Cambridge.
   ``This company is like a family to me,'' said Booth. ``When my
family gets attacked I fight ... and when my company gets attacked,
I fight, too.''
   Shamrock, a California investment firm controlled by Roy E.
Disney, made an unsolicited offer July 20 to buy Polaroid. Shamrock
raised its offer last Friday, but the offer was unanimously
rejected Tuesday by Polaroid's board of directors.
   According to today's Boston Globe, Shamrock has indicated it is
prepared to launch a hostile tender offer if Polaroid refuses to
negotiate.
   On the heels of a previously announced restructing plan aimed at
cutting costs and boosting profitability, Polaroid's latest
defensive maneuver includes the elimination of 500 to 800
additional people through voluntary retirement; the repurchase of
$300 million in Polaroid stock, and the issuance of 10 million new
shares for an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
   The ESOP, which gives employees 14 percent control of Polaroid,
has been challenged by Shamrock in a Delaware court. Shamrock
opposes the plan because by voting on the side of management,
employees can effectively block a takeover.
   Six of the company's 27 officers have agreed to leave, including
senior vice president and treasurer Harvey H. Thayer; senior vice
president of strategic planning Milton S. Dietz, and Joseph J.
McLaughlin, group vice president of worldwide marketing. Three
other vice presidents were also among the group.
   As further incentive for early retirement, employees who leave
immediately will be paid through Nov. 30.
   ``If that doesn't work,'' Booth said, ``we will have to rely on
layoffs.''
   Recalling earlier words of assurance that apparently all but
excluded layoffs, Booth told his managers, ``I didn't expect to be
in this type of warfare when I made my pledge.''

   International air passenger traffic is expected to

   This year, non-domestic traffic is likely to increase about 8
percent worldwide, and growth will taper off slightly but remain
strong over the next four years, the International Air Transport

   The average annual increase until 1992 was forecast at 9 percent

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Friday
urged EEC nations to remember that Turkey is ``part of Europe'' and
cautioned against delay in considering his nation's bid to be a
full-fledged member of the European Economic Community.
   Yilmaz, in his first news conference since assuming the post
nine months ago, said Turkey's application, submitted in April
1987, is currently being studied at technical levels by a committee.
   The EEC's governing body, the council of ministers, will act
upon the committee report, either turning down Turkey's bid or
inviting Turkey to join in talks aimed at arranging full membership.
   ``The message we give to our European friends is that no matter
what the committee recommends, the final decision is basically a
political one and Turkey is politically and strategically a part of
Europe,'' Yilmaz said.
   Turkey will not settle for less than eventual full membership,
Yilmaz said.
   Negotiations for membership should start ``in a reasonable
period of time,'' the foreign minister said without citing a
timetable.
   If the trading bloc turns down Turkey's application or takes too
long to review it, ``Turkey will review its relationship with
Western Europe,'' Yilmaz told reporters.
   Many member countries have opposed Turkey's membership on
grounds that it the country is economically backward or that its
democracy needs perfecting.
   Greece, which has major disputes with Turkey, has made clear it
will block Turkey's bid unless Turkish troops in Cyprus are
withdrawn.

latest inflation rate and interest rate rise.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a few months ago, Britain's economic
``disease'' of rampant inflation, sky-high interest rates and
persistent unemployment was pronounced cured by just about everyone
except the Conservative government's staunchest critics.
   Today, the economy is suffering something of a relapse,
exhibiting that old familiar symptom, higher inflation, and the
government admits it is troubling.
   In addition, a hike in interest rates and a sharp widening of
the trade deficit are worrying economists.
   Ironically, the symptoms' cause is the economy's vigorous
growth, which is stretching resources and driving up prices. Like
its trading ally, the United States, Britain faces the threat that
its economy could overheat into recession.
   The peak came in March when the Treasury's top official,
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, announced the first
surplus budget in nearly 20 years and slashed the top income tax
rate to 40 percent from 60 percent.
   Since then, the attention has turned instead to Britain's annual
inflation rate, which, fed by strong consumer spending, has jumped
from 3.5 percent to 4.8 percent in July. In his budget speech,
Lawson had forecast an inflation rate of 4 percent by the end of
the year.
   To combat higher inflation _ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
No. 1 economic priority _ the government has pushed interest rates
up more than 3.5 percentage points since early June.
   ``Whatever action is necessary to keep inflation under control,
this government will take,'' Lawson told members of Parliament in
late July, characterizing the pickup as ``modest but unacceptable.''
   Strength in the dollar gave the government room to raise
interest rates without pushing the British pound dangerously high.
But the pound, which has been trading at about 3.20 West German
marks, remains well above a rate of 3 marks which the government
long had protected.
   The pound broke through that ceiling in March, raising concerns
that Britain's export competitiveness might be hurt. Indeed, the
trade deficit is much worse than Lawson had forecast.
   For the first six months of 1988, Britain had a current account
deficit of 5.6 billion pounds ($9.6 billion), compared with a 1.6
billion pound ($2.6 billion) deficit in all of 1987. The current
account includes ``invisible'' trade such as services and overseas
investment earnings.
   In his budget speech, Lawson had forecast a trade deficit of 4
billion pounds ($7 billion) for all of 1988.
   ``Things have deteriorated,'' said Ian Harwood, an economist at
the London investment firm Warburg Securities. ``The major part of
the reason for the deterioration has been the way the economy has
been growing so much faster than expected.''
   David Owen, an economist with the London investment firm
Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd., said ``domestic demand is just growing
too quickly for its own good.''
   The latest survey conducted by the polling organization Market
and Opinion Research International, showed that in July, for the
first time since February 1987, more people thought the state of
the economy would get worse rather than better over the next year.
   Economists expect Britain's gross domestic product _ its total
output of goods and services _ to grow between 3.5 percent and 4
percent this year, faster than the 3 percent forecast by Lawson in
March, and following growth of 4.4 percent in 1987.
   On top of the troubling symptoms, there have been recurrent
reports of a rift between Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson over currency
exchange policy.
   These have been fueled by the pound's rise and the government's
negotiations with Mrs. Thatcher's former economic adviser, Sir Alan
Walters, for him to return to her Downing Street office next year.
   Mrs. Thatcher advocates free-market policies while Lawson favors
managing exchange rates through direct intervention in the markets
and the adjustment of interest rates.
   However, Lawson survived a Cabinet reshuffle by Mrs. Thatcher in
late July and now appears likely to remain until at least after
next spring's budget.
   But the economic outlook remains worrying, Harwood said.
   Inflation will peak at 6 percent early next year, interest rates
might move higher into the double digits, and the trade deficit
probably will balloon to 10 billion pounds ($17.2 billion) in 1988,
Harwood predicted.
   The government remains upbeat.
   ``The difficulties that beset us are difficulties we have
successfully dealt with in the past, and will do so again, without
drama, and without interrupting the steady progress we have already
achieved,'' Lawson said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
but quickly turned mixed today in light trading on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Much of the early buying was based on the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Thursday that it had targeted China
for sales of an additional 2 million metric tons of subsidized U.S.
wheat, analysts said.
   ``That got things fired up a little bit here. The excitement was
on the wheat,'' said Jerry Gidel, a grain market analyst with G.H.
Miller, a Chicago-based commodities trading division of
British-owned LIT America Inc.
   But light showers and cooler temperatures in the heart of the
Midwestern croplands put pressure on corn and soybean futures.
   Analysts say the grain markets appear to be responding more
readily to export news than to weather factors, although soybean
growers would welcome more rain to help their plants through the
end of the critical flowering and pod-setting stage.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.96 a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to 1\ cents higher with September at $2.89 a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower with September at $2.58{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 9 cents higher with August
at $8.80 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .40 cent lower to .18 cent higher with August
at 71.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .62 cent
lower with August at 81.95 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.35 cent higher with August at 47.70 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .85 cent to 1.63 cent higher with August at 37.80
cents a pound.
   Pork bellies settled sharply higher on Thursday, hog futures
were higher and cattle were mixed.

   Unemployment in Switzerland, already
the lowest in the industralized West, dropped to a six-year low
last month while the number of vacant positions reached a
seven-year-high, authorities announced Friday.
   The Federal Office for Industry and Labor said that a total of
20,963 jobless were registered in July, an 8.7 percent drop from
the previous month.
   The office said this was the lowest figure since October 1982.
The unemployment rate remained at 0.7 percent.
   Vacant full-time jobs totaled 13,987 the highest since 1981.
Klaus Hug, director of the labor office, said unemployment now had
reached about its bottom level and that no further spectacular
decline was expected.

<HEAD>GC&B Brands Launches New Bid For Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GC&C Brands Ltd. on Friday launched a new bid for
Irish Distillers Group PLC that values Ireland's leading whiskey
distiller at 253 million Irish punts, or about $354 million.
   The $5.60-a-share bid was made hours after GC&C received
regulatory clearance from Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers
to proceed with a new bid for Irish Distillers, maker of Jameson's
and other whiskies.
   GC&C, a consortium-owned group, was restructured as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan PLC on Wednesday. The move
was part of a negotiated settlement between the European Community
Commission and the three original partners in the consortium.
   Under terms of the settlement, Grand Metropolitan agreed to buy
out the interests of Allied-Lyons PLC and Guinness PLC, the two
other companies involved.
   The group originally launched a joint $281 million bid for Irish
Distillers. Under conditions set by the takeover panel, GC&C's
offer constitutes a new bid and isn't technically a revised offer.
   The takeover panel had given GC&C until Monday to announce terms
of a new bid and set a 21-day limit for the offer to remain open.
   GC&C's original offer, which was launched in May and amounted to
$4.46 a share, had attracted 20.34 percent of the shares by last
week.
   The EC blocked the joint bid because officials said the
consortium decided in advance to split up Irish Distillers' markets
and brands, which would violate the Community's competition law.

<HEAD>A Global Market in Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few Americans need to be told anymore that they
are living in a global market, not with all the European cars and
Japanese cameras they have been buying.
   They read stories about British corporations buying out their
American counterparts and Japanese buying up skyscrapers. They
drink Mexican beer. They wear Italian and Brazilian shoes. They
stay at foreign-owned hotels.
   Hardly a day goes by that they do not hear about the value of
the dollar in relation to the pound, yen and mark, and while they
might not realize what all the to-do is about they recognize it is
of global importance.
   And, of course, they also hear about the need for American
companies to export in order to reduce the imbalance of
international payments, which is high on any list of the country's
most urgent and exasperating problems.
   While all this is not new, the understanding of it may even now
not be fully appreciated, because the United States for a century
had the world's biggest economy. It didn't need to export. It
didn't even think about it.
   But now that the global economy is here, Americans face a big
question mark in an area they have not yet given much thought to.
The labor market, that is, also has become globalized, and it could
be affecting millions already.
   In fact, many economic analysts wonder if global competition has
not had a lot to do with the stability of American wages over the
past five years, marked especially by unusual calm in labor
union-management relations.
   Having lost millions of jobs to lower-cost producers in other
countries, organized labor was forced to acknowledge that jobs
could be exported as readily as goods. Foreign workers wanted those
jobs; they got millions of them.
   The impact of all this, however, has been overshadowed during
the past five years by a concurrent phenomenon, the enormous growth
of domestic jobs. To some extent, it hid the fact that so much
employment was sent abroad.
   Now, a test is coming.
   Many economists contend that with the jobless rate now at about
5.4 percent of the civilian labor force, further declines cannot
take place without putting upward pressure on wages. It would
ignite inflation, they say.
   But maybe not. In a global marketplace, such a situation
conceivably could be averted by importing goods made by foreign
workers rather than employing American workers in domestic
factories.
   This factor already was cited in the most recent quarterly
report of the National Federation of Independent Business. ``The
impact of operating in a world labor market (coupled with good
inflation experience) seems to be keeping the lid on wages
increases,'' said economist William Dunkelberg.
   American workers obviously are loathe to lose jobs to foreign
competition, and therefore seem reluctant to seek higher wages.
Based on the low jobless rate they seemingly could; it used to be a
regular occurrence when the jobless rate fell. But according to the
survey, little pressure is evident yet.
   This is uncharted territory for workers, the U.S. economy and
economists.
   ``In this new environment, with differing labor demands, it will
be interesting to see how low the unemployment rate can go before
we encounter significant labor shortages,'' says Dunkelberg.
   Nobody really knows how low that might be, because American
workers know that management has an alternative. That is, it can
simply decide it is less expensive to make products abroad than it
is at home.

<DATELINE>JASTRZEBIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the end of their shift, the miners
of Jastrzebie trade their cramped quarters in the coal pits for
their tiny apartments in concrete high-rises.
   Many miners in this town at the center of the latest wave of
Polish strikes must toil seven days a week to supplement their
wages and gain access to special stores that are open only to
miners who agree to work weekends.
   They say long lines for food, irregular family life and constant
manipulation of their interests by management led to anger,
frustration and the strikes that began Tuesday in this mountain
town of 100,000 near the Czechoslovakian border.
   ``What kind of a family life can a man have here?'' said a miner
in his mid-30s, speaking in his two-room apartment overlooking the
mine. He asked that his name not be used.
   For many miners the outlawed trade union Solidarity gave them a
voice and hope that they could change the way they work and live.
   Residents are still proud that key agreements between Solidarity
and the government were signed in Jastrzebie in September 1980.
   And they will never forget the nine miners killed by security
police at the Wujek mine near Katowice, about 35 miles to the
northeast, after martial law was imposed in December 1981,
suppressing Solidarity. The series of strikes are for better wages
and recognition of Solidarity.
   ``You've got to have a goal. In Solidarity you found out you
were worth something. It's a wonderful thing nobody can take
away,'' said Janina Wolnikowska, a local Solidarity activist.
   While her son and husband strike in two different mines, Mrs.
Wolnikowka runs a strike support center in the nearby Holy Virgin
Mary Roman Catholic church that supplies sandwiches and coffee.
   ``I didn't sleep all night, but it's not hard for me,'' she
said. ``We must get through to the men on strike and it's our job
to organize that.''
   Residents have started collecting money to assist the striking
miners and their families.
   Outside the modern July Manifesto mine, which produces
high-grade coal for export, families line up daily waiting for
police to allow them through the barriers to deliver food and
encouragement to their striking relatives holed up in the plant.
   Bread is scarce in the stores near the mine and beer has
disappeared.
   Police patrol the town and are stationed at the entrance to the
church, where the phone was cut early in the strike. Management has
refused to allow priests into the mine.
   Situated atop rolling hills, Jastrzebie was a small spa until it
was rapidly built up about 25 years ago to exploit the rich coal
beds.
   To attract workers, wages were set above the national average
and the waiting time for apartments was often less than a year.
People in other parts of Poland can wait for decades.
   Children, whose lives and future are tied to the mine, appear
immune to the strict police controls, darting in and out of the
dozens of large police vans and trucks around the mine.
   ``Our whole town is on strike. Is America on strike too?'' asked
one small boy.
   Residents spend evenings listening to foreign radio stations,
wondering who will support them throughout the country.
   ``Are you going to work?'' one miner asked another in the
elevator of one high-rise.
   ``Maybe,'' replied the other, who walked away.

   A survey of employee absence rates has found
that 18 percent of companies have almost one full day of absence
each week per worker.
   The survey, by Uniforce Temporary Services, a temporary
employment agency, found these companies have an absence rate of 11
percent to 20 percent. Meanwhile, 82 percent of the businesses that
responded to the survey reported absence rates of 2 percent to 10
percent.
   Uniforce said it mailed 5,000 questionnaires, of which 26
percent, or 1,342, were returned. Eighty-one percent of the
respondents were in banking or finance, 28 percent were
manufacturers and 22 percent described themselves as service
companies. Government agencies and educational institutions were
among the other respondents.
   The survey was the first on the issue taken by Uniforce.
   The questionnaire asked managers to list the causes of excessive
absenteeism in order of importance. Lack of supervision for
employees was ranked first, followed by the lack of a policy on
absenteeism and the lack of rewards for good attendance.
   To control excessive absenteeism, 41 percent of the respondents
said they use disciplinary action or penalties combined with
rewards or incentives, 52 percent use disciplinary action alone and
7 percent used rewards alone.

<HEAD>Racket-Maker Donnay Declared Bankrupt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donnay SA, once the world's top maker
of tennis rackets, was declared bankrupt Friday by a Belgian court
after failing to reach a deal with creditors to restructure its
massive debt.
   The family-run company is likely to become a takeover target,
and several potential acquirers who had been anticipating the
bankruptcy are expected to come forward, sources said.
   Donnay climbed to the top rank among the world's tennis racket
makers when Bjorn Borg advertised its products a decade ago, but
the company began to suffer heavy losses after the Swedish champion
retired in 1981.
   Although its business was declining, banks continued to lend
Donnay money, asking very few guarantees, said Fabrice Jacquemart,
a spokesman for the government of Wallonia in southern Belgium,
which has a 27 percent stake in the company.
   ``Donnay got this credit line because of its notoriety,'' he
said. But the Walloon government and the unions want to avoid a
takeover for Donnay's name only.
   ``The unions will be vigilant to avoid that a company takeover
will be agreed to with the sole purpose of buying the name of the
brand,'' said union spokesman Jacques Hardy.
   Donnay's debts total about 1.4 billion francs, or $35 million,
Jacquemart said. Weeks of negotiations with banks and the Walloon
government failed to result in an accord that would have prevented
the bankruptcy.
   Creditors refused to provide new funds for Donnay, which has
subsidiaries in the United States, Hong Kong, Brazil and
Switzerland. Its 1987 revenue stood at $29 million, down a third
from 1986, and its losses totaled $2 million.
   The Donnay family started a firm in 1910 with six workers who
made wooden tool handles. It moved into tennis rackets in the
1930s, but the business took decades later when Donnay contracted
with Borg, then a little-known rookie who went on to win five
Wimbledon titles.
   At its peak, Donnay made over 1.5 million rackets a year and
employed 600 people. But its output slipped 50 percent and its
staff was cut to 350 when the company's fortunes started fading in
concert with Borg's retirement.
   Other problems also dogged Donnay. The company had trouble
marketing its products to an international audience as well as
keeping up with technological changes in the sport.
   When rackets shifted from wood to synthetics and fibers in the
early 1980s, Donnay lagged the revolution. And the company was
unable to replace Borg with one of the new rising stars of tennis.

   Share prices rose Friday as a handful of food
manufacturing and engineering stocks led the market higher.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
10.4 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,844.3.
   Volume was a light 342.4 million shares, up from 335.2 million
shares Thursday.
   Dealers said the overall tone of the market remained firm, but
they noted there was little specific news to drive individual share
prices.
   ``There weren't many sellers around, so the market followed its
recent tendency to move higher,'' one dealer said.
   The market showed virtually no reaction to Friday's release of
the British government's latest report on retail prices, which
matched market expectations. Retail prices rose 0.1 percent in July
from the previous month and 4.8 percent from the year-ago period.
   In the afternoon, London share prices got a boost from Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials moved higher.

   The stock market advanced marginally today in
thin pre-weekend trading, but few brokers saw signs of a clear
breakout from the current slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 4.98 points
to 2,032.01 as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.19 to 148.00. The
American Stock Exchange market-value index fell 0.02 to 294.94.
   Gaining issues outnumbered advances by about 7-to-6 on the NYSE,
with 701 up, 584 down and 561 unchanged. Volume totaled 77.76
million shares with two hours of trading left.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a stock analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, linked the advance to higher prices in
the bond market, which pushed yields lower and made stocks a more
attractive investment than bonds. But the bond market retreated
later and the stock gains eroded as well.
   ``Nobody's committing any money,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager
of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``We're going to be in the doldrums for awhile.''

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines will lay off up to 1,000
pilots, flight attendants and other personnel as part of a fall
cutback in service, the company's chairman said today.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of both Continental and its parent,
Texas Air Corp., said the layoffs will be formally announced in the
next few days as part of the carrier's new fall schedule.
   Lorenzo, who testified at a federal court hearing on plans by
Continental's sister carrier, Eastern Airlines, to curtail service
to 14 cities, said the retrenchment would include laying off
between 300 and 500 pilots.
   Speaking to reporters after his court appearance, Lorenzo said
the layoffs would involve 2 percent to 3 percent of the company's
36,000 employees. He did not provide a breakdown of the other
employees who would be furloughed, but said they included flight
attendants and management personnel.
   Continental posted a net loss of $231 million for the first six
months of the year.
   The layoffs were first reported by the Houston Chronicle in
today's editions. The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as
saying Denver would be the primary focus of the layoffs.
   Continental announced earlier this year that it would reduce the
number of flights at Denver's Stapleton International Airport from
260 a day to 200, beginning next month.
   ``Obviously, we continue to look at our fall schedule and the
continued overcapacity of Denver and are focusing our attention on
what changes may be required and the effect that might have on our
employees,'' Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks told the Chronicle.
   Earlier this month Miami-based Eastern announced it was reducing
operations by 12 percent and eliminating about 4,000 jobs.
   A federal judge in Washington, however, issued a temporary
injunction blocking the job cuts and is holding hearings on the
issue.
   Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract
negotiations with two of its unions.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after early excitement about a
wheat offer to China faded into a lackluster session with
relatively light trading.
   The Agriculture Department's announcement late Thursday that it
had targeted China for sales of 2 million metric tons of subsidized
U.S. wheat gave the grain markets an early boost.
   But after that, ``there wasn't a lot of new news and the market
kind of slipped away,'' said Jerry Gidel, a grain market analyst
with G.H. Miller, a Chicago-based commodities trading division of
British-owned LIT America Inc.
   Wheat and corn futures finished slightly lower but soybeans
posted steeper losses on ideas that Friday's light showers and
cooler temperatures would benefit the struggling Midwestern soybean
crop. Afternoon readings in the region were mostly in the 70s but
temperatures in the 90s were expected to return early next week.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent to 3\ cents lower with September
at $3.92 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2{ cents lower with
September at $2.87} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 6{ cents lower
with September at $2.59{ a bushel; soybeans were 12\ cents lower to

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said Friday that
its 1,750-mile All-American Pipeline, which it started building
three years ago, will be sold to pay off debts.
   Goodyear Chairman Robert E. Mercer said that while the company
is forming a plan to sell the oil pipeline to a group of
purchasers, ``no consortium has been formed, no negotiations have
been held and no specific terms have been discussed, including
price.''
   ``We have held some preliminary discussions with several firms
and have received some indications of interest,'' he said in a
statement.
   The $1-billion pipeline project was started to transport oil
from the West Coast to refineries in Texas, said Goodyear spokesman
John Perduyn. The pipeline currently extends 1,200 miles from Santa
Barbara, Calif., to McCamey, Texas, and is pumping 70,000 barrels
of oil a day on a test basis, he said.
   Goodyear began selling some assets a year ago to pay a debt
incurred to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Anglo-French
financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   The Akron-based tire company avoided Goldsmith's grasp by buying
back Goldsmith's 11.5 percent stake for $49.50 a share, or $619
million.
   Among the assets already sold by Goodyear are its oil and gas
fields, with the West Coast fields going to Exxon Corp.

   The stock market trudged to a slightly higher
finish today in some of the lightest trading of the year, capping a
dreary week of investor apathy and confusion about where prices are
going.
   ``The market's been closed for the week,'' said Robert Meyer,
director of research at the Fahnestock & Co. investment firm in New
York. ``I think there's a general lack of confidence in the market,
particularly because of uncertanty over the economy and direction
of interest rates.''
   With short-term Treasury bonds offering relatively high rates of
interest, brokers said, there's not much inclination for investors
to risk their money in stocks.

   French automaker Peugeot SA, its minuscule
presence in the U.S. auto market continuing to decline, is pinning
hopes for recovery on a new model that Europe has named its car of
the year.
   The front-wheel drive Peugeot 405 is being offered in three
models, but Peugeot officials, dealers and industry analysts agree
its most attractive attribute is its base price of $14,500.
   ``We think this car is very right for the marketplace. It is a
range many of our European competitors have gotten away from,''
said Bill Kelly, national sales manager for Peugeot Motors of
America Inc.
   The 405 models, built largely by robot at Peugeot's Sochaux
plant in eastern France, join the Peugeot 505, a basic midsize
sedan, which has been sold in the United States since 1980.
   Sales of the Peugeot 505 have declined drastically in the last
two years _ from 14,431 in 1986 to 9,409 in 1987. Through the first
seven months of this year, Peugeot has sold 4,015 cars compared
with 5,293 for the same period last year.
   Kelly said the company has projected selling 15,405 of the new
Peugeot 405 models in the 1989 sales year and figures on selling
3,505 of the restyled 505 series cars.
   Peugeot's three 405 models are the DL, ($14,500) the S (about
$17,500) and the 16-valve Mi 16 ($21,000).
   ``They've priced it right and it has gotten some good reviews,''
said Thomas O'Grady, an analyst with Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa. ``The things they've got to get over
are marketing, positioning and advertising. They do have a history
of product and dealer problems,''
   Kelly said Peugeot will launch the most extensive advertising
campaign in Peugeot history to bring the Peugeot 405 to the
attention of the American public, especially the 25- to 49-year-old
male who is making at least $40,000 a year.
   While he declined to say how much the company will spend, Kelly
said the target audience will see the Peugeot 405 an average of 29
times between mid-August and Nov. 1 on cable and network
television, billboards and in magazines.
   The Peugeot's popularity has been mostly on the East Coast but
Kelly said that in the long range, he thinks the front-wheel-drive
405 will find a home with proportionately more Midwestern owners.
   Pascal Henault, Peugeot's U.S. president, said being the lone
French carmaker in the 10 million-unit U.S. market is a plus
because Peugeot can have its product identified without confusion
that accompanies other Europeans battling each other in the United
States.
   ``We are very happy with this lack of confusion,'' he said.
   Yet, Peugeot's problems with the Peugeot 505 _ its consumer
reliability in a recent survey was near the bottom _ and what Kelly
called a disastrous relationship with its dealers, will take time
to heal.
   Henault said special quality control checks of 300 areas of each
car imported to the United States should help Peugeot gain consumer
confidence.
   Kelly said the dealer network is being asked for its opinion on
many aspects of the business and is coming around. Of the 250
Peugeot dealers in the United States, 20 percent of them carry
exclusively Peugeot products.
   In Maplewood, N.J., the nation's largest Peugeot dealer by
volume last year is happy with the new product. One 405 is on the
showroom floor and seven orders have been written based on
customers seeing the single model.
   ``The 405 is bringing us a younger crowd where the front-wheel
drive is certainly important,'' salesman Fernando Valente said.
``We're getting a very, very positive response.''

<HEAD>Venezuela Sticks Second Toe in Water With New Bond Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela is sticking a second toe into the
waters of the international bond market with a new $100 million
issue.
   The 5-year Eurobond issue is small by the standards of today's
capital markets. But in light of the international debt crisis, it
has a symbolic value: It marks only the second time that a
developing nation debtor has ventured into the world bond market
since the debt problem began in 1982.
   Since then, Third World debtors have raised cash mainly with big
loans from foreign commercial banks and international organizations
_ not by tapping bond investors.
   The first testing of the the post-1982 waters also belonged to
Venezuela. Last February, the Latin American oil producer launched
its first international bond issue since the crisis _ a $100
million issue underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities and Banco de
Venezuela, a private bank.
   Although most of the bonds were purchased by Venezuelan
investors, the issue was considered a success and emboldened the
Caracas government to try a second time.
   There are several reasons why it has been the Venezuelans,
rather than other Third World debtors, who have ventured into the
market. Although it too has its problems, the Venezuelan economy _
with the help of oil revenues _ is considered more stable than
those of most other debtor nations. The country has paid back a big
portion of its foreign debt, which now stands at around $34 billion.
   Experts say the new bonds, to be issued on Monday, are really a
way for the Venezuelans to measure the country's creditworthiness
in the eyes of foreign investors. By nurturing the perception that
Venezuela is again welcome in the capital markets, the Venezuelans
could become less dependent on foreign banks, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   ``They're in a kind of quasi-market borrowing status,'' said
Robert McCauley, an economist for the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress.
   Loans from the IMF and the World Bank are politically sensitive,
since they carry strings _ often in the form of required economic
austerity programs in the borrowing countries.
   The sensitivity has been heightened in Venezuela by the
presidential election scheduled for early December, since the debt
issue can provide powerful ammunition for the opposition parties.
Although Carlos Andres Perez, a candidate from the ruling Accion
Democratica party, is widely expected to win, it is not clear
whether he will continue the government's current debt policies.
   Even the organizers of the new bond issue acknowledge the
prickliness of the situation. Oliver Parr, a director of Samuel
Montagu & Co. Ltd. in London, conceded the upcoming election makes
the timing of the issue ``not entirely satisfactory.''
   ``The foreign debt issue is a highly political matter in all
Latin American countries,'' Parr said.
   The new bonds will be offered to investors on a high-risk,
high-yield basis _ not unlike the ``junk'' bonds that have gained
popularity in this country as a way to finance corporate takeovers.
   The Venezuelan bonds carry a yield of 1.875 percentage point
over the London Interbank Offered Rate _ known as the Libor rate, a
widely used benchmark for international issues.
   ``It's pretty much a junk spread'' over Libor, McCauley said.
   Other sovereign bonds from ``Triple-A'' borrowers such as
Britain have been offered at the Libor rate, while South Korea
recently offered bonds at only a quarter point over the benchmark
rate.
   Still, everything's relative, and the Venezuelan bonds appear to
have a better chance than other debtors' bonds would.
   ``Venezuela is deemed to be in better shape,'' a New York banker
said. ``It's a working political system that can deal with change.''

   Oil futures prices finished higher Friday in
dull trading in the absence of any significant news.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 16 cents a barrel to close at $15.73. Other
contract months also increased.
   Futures prices of oil products traded on the exchange also rose.
Contracts for September delivery of wholesale heating oil were up
0.33 cent to finish at 44.48 cents a gallon. September gasoline
climbed 0.31 cent to 47.59 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said Friday's oil futures market was uneventful, with
prices moving in a narrow range.
   ``I would describe the day's market as thin and listless,'' said
John H. O'Connell, an analyst at Refco Inc.
   Traders were not influenced by the coming closeout of the
September crude oil contract on Monday, analysts said. Earlier in
the week, prices on the September contract rose slightly as
investors took last-minute positions in advance of the closeout.
   Analysts said trading in energy futures was generally dull
throughout the week in the absence of fresh news to influence
prices.

<HEAD>Economy Gives More Ammunition to Bush Than to Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As George Bush received the Republican Party's
presidential nomination this past week, the prime rate stood at 10
percent, its highest point in three years.
   But the run-up in interest rates may not quite play into the
hands of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. The reason: In
1980, under the last Democratic president, the prime rate peaked at
more than 21 percent.
   All things considered, the performance of the U.S. economy seems
to give more ammunition to Bush than to Dukakis this season.
   From the Republican side:
   ``I think it's an unambiguous plus for the Bush campaign,'' said
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at the investment firm Bear,
Stearns & Co. and a former chief economist of President Reagan's
Office of Management and Budget.
   From the Democratic side:
   ``On a scale from a zero to 100, for Bush, the economy will be
kind of an 80. The Democrats can't look to a bad economy,'' said
Charles Schultze, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, who was a chairman of President Carter's Council of
Economic Advisers.
   Unemployment has fallen to 5.4 percent from 7.8 percent eight
years ago; inflation is down to about 4 percent from about 10
percent in the summer of 1980.
   After a pair of short, sharp recessions early in the Reagan
administration, the nation has experienced the longest peacetime
economic expansion in history.
   ``I think the challenge for Bush is to convince voters that he
will build on those successes in the 1990s,'' Kudlow said.
   The Dukakis campaign stressed the bad news on inflation this
past week as various economic reports indicated a possibly
overheating economy.
   Record imports contributed to a bulge in the trade deficit,
industrial production shot up and the nation's factories ran at
their fastest rate since 1980, the government said.
   Together, the reports pointed toward higher inflation and seemed
to bolster the decision by the nation's major banks to raise their
prime rate to 10 percent.
   ``When interest rates were pumped up last week, in effect a
hidden tax was imposed on all working families. I think that's bad
news for Republicans,'' said Thomas D. Herman, the deputy national
issues director for the Dukakis campaign.
   Although the economic reports raised some realistic concerns
about inflation, they also undermined Democrats' claims that the
economy was growing too slowly.
   Another way of looking at the economy is with a measure of the
economy's health called the voter discomfort index that is
maintained by economist Albert H. Cox Jr.
   The index is a sum of the jobless rate, the mortgage rate and
the inflation rate, minus the rate of economic growth. The higher,
the worse.
   Jimmy Carter lost re-election in 1980 when the index was a
whopping 32.5. Reagan won re-election by a landslide in 1984 when
it had dropped to 17.4. Now it stands just under 16.
   Bush's biggest weakness is the huge federal budget deficit and
the nation's status as the world's biggest debtor, said Schultze,
the Carter administration economist.
   Unfortunately, Schultze said, voters do not necessarily perceive
Democrats as the ones to solve the debt and spending problems.
   ``It's very hard to cash in when you don't have an answer for
it,'' he said.
   Bush's pledge of no new taxes, which he repeated Thursday, could
become a liability if voters get the idea that the candidate is
promising more than he can deliver.
   Dukakis has said he would raise taxes as a last resort.
   Kudlow said he believes Bush's pledge is realistic, but the
candidate needs to flesh out his announced plan to balance the
budget by 1993 by holding the growth in spending to less than the
growth in revenue.
   ``He has to generate the proper arithmetic to give credibility
to this freeze proposal,'' Kudlow said.
   Schultze said Bush cannot generate the proper arithmetic because
``the flexible freeze is a joke. It's literally a joke.''
   The plan depends on unrealistic assumptions about lower interest
rate payments on the national debt and would include politically
impossible slashes in the Medicare budget, Schultze said.
   While the Democrats do not have a detailed deficit-reduction
plan themselves, Schultze said, ``The only thing they are not doing
is they're not digging themselves into a hole by ruling out a tax
increase.''

<HEAD>USX Plant Sale To Iraq Not A Security Threat, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Government officials say national security does not
appear to be an issue in the proposed sale of steelmaking equipment
from a shuttered USX Corp. plant to the government of Iraq.
   But opponents claim that the sale of the Texas Works plant in
Baytown would threaten peace negotiations between Iraq and Iran and
is a deliberate move by the steelmaker to lessen competition.
   Republican Rep. Jack Fields said Friday he is concerned that USX
would be exporting ``state-of-the-art armorizing technology ...
used for tanks and other military applications'' to a country that
harbors terrorists and last year attacked a U.S. battleship in the
Persian Gulf.
   But a Commerce Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said officials believe ``the technology is very old, very
outmoded'' and do not anticipate ``any national security issues to
be involved.''
   Echoing that sentiment, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider said, ``On the surface, it is not a defense issue.''
   Fields, whose district near Houston includes the plant, has
asked President Reagan, the Justice Department, Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci and Commerce Secretary C. William Verity to
investigate the proposed sale on the grounds that national security
is treatened and that USX may be unlawfully attempting to eliminate
competition.
   ``When Congress returns in September, I think this question
going to be looked at very closely, in terms of national security,
steel supply and that it's anti-competitive,'' Fields said.
   The plant, which once employed as many as 2,000 people, was shut
down two years ago amid labor turmoil and declining demand for
steel. It had produced up to 1.3 million tons a year of
large-diameter pipe used in the United States for oil and natural
gas pipelines.
   The works include electric furnaces for melting scrap, casters
to shape molten steel into slabs and a mill for making slabs into
oil drilling pipe.
   Iraq already has made a $1 million down payment to USX for the
20-year-old steelmaking equipment, which would be dismantled and
then reassembled in Iraq, Field said.
   But two domestic companies are prepared to offer a price
comparable to what Iraq will pay, reported Friday by the New York
Times to be about $100 million, Fields said.
   Among possible domestic purchasers Fields listed were Major
Financial Services Corp. of Tallahassee, Fla., and Birmingham Steel
Corp. of Birmingham, Ala.
   Fields said USX has ``made statements that have led me to
believe they are not concerned about jobs in this country and
really do not want to sell to an American company. They want to
remove capacity, it keeps their prices high.''
   USX spokesman William P. Ryder would not confirm the reported
pricetag on the plant but said USX, formerly US Steel, is
negotiating the sale of the equipment from the closed facility with
the Iraqi minister of industry.
   Ryder would not respond further to Fields' claims.
   ``When you've got domestic purchasers willing to pay as much
value or more, why is USX bent on selling this equipment to Iraq?
They are simply anti-competitive,'' Fields said. ``I am convinced
USX is trying to keep the price of steel slab and steel plate
high.''
   Justice Department spokesman Mark Sheehan said the agency was
taking a preliminary look to see whether an anti-trust
investigation is warranted.
   Fields said he met last week with Iraqi Ambassador Abdul-Amir
Al-Anbari, who requested the meeting a day after Fields blasted the
deal at a Capitol news conference.
   ``Basically, he said he would appreciate me not dragging Iraq
into this controversy. I said, `Like it or not Mr. Ambassador,
you're in this controversy.'''
   Fields said he suggested the ambassador try to persuade Iraq to
back out because ``it would be a tremendous humanitarian gesture in
the interest of jobs'' since 750 people could be employed if the
plant were reopened.
   He said the ambassador was surprised Iraq was buying used
equipment but told him a $1 million down payment had been made.
   ``He kept saying the $1 million had been paid down,'' Fields
said. ``One million is not a lot when it comes to the bad publicity
that your country is going to receive.''

<HEAD>Convention Draws Yawn on Street; Just Way To Pass the Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since traders had little else to do this past
week, many passed time by musing about presidential politics. But
few based strategies on the prospect of prosperity under either
Michael Dukakis or George Bush.
   In fact, some noted, if Bush had hoped to ignite followers into
a victory frenzy at the Republican National Convention by promising
millions of new jobs, low inflation and no tax increases, Wall
Street wasn't terribly impressed.
   Nor did the market find reassurance in Bush's choice for vice
president, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, a little-known conservative
baby boomer who faced intense press scrutiny over questions about
his military record.
   That is not to imply investment professionals believe Dukakis
and running mate Lloyd Bentsen are any better, although some
studies have shown the stock market has done better under a
Democratic administration.
   ``The election isn't sparking any interest in the market one way
or another. When you look at it, it's not a contest of two dynamic
people,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice president and manager
of institutional trading at Dillon, Read & Co. in New York.
   ``I feel the institutional-investor community is looking ahead
into 1989, and no matter who gets in, we're in for a lot of
trouble,'' Puccio said. ``There will be hard decisions that will
have to be made, regarding our trade and budget deficits. Higher
taxes, the Street is looking at that.''
   Despite the cynicism, some said Bush's vow in his Thursday night
acceptance speech to keep taxes down may have played a role in a
mild rally the stock market enjoyed early Friday, one of the few in
an otherwise dreary week.
   Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, said Bush's battle cry ``helped a
little bit.''
   Likewise, when the market strengthened last Tuesday despite
alarming news about a worsening trade deficit, some brokers thought
it was a reaction to the Bush nomination process and called it a
Republican rally.
   Others called that thinking ridiculous conjecture.
   ``I think the markets are sophisticated enough to concentrate on
the fundamentals,'' said Richard Wholey, a broker-analyst at Wayne
Hummer & Co. in Chicago. ``It's easy and convenient sometimes for
market professionals and journalists to look for those type of
answers. Most researchers will tell you there isn't a measurable
effect.''
   Judging from the market's behavior this past week, he was right.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials hit a three-month low last
Monday, then moved in a narrow range, finishing Friday at 2,016.00
for a weekly loss of 21.52.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.01 to 147.54;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.53 to 377.42; and the American Stock Exchange market-value index
fell 1.45 to 295.03.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 144.61 million shares a day,
against 180.08 million a day the week before. It was the lowest
average weekly volume since late May.
   Paul Campbell Jr., a stock analyst at Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York, said that if there is any market
reaction to a presidential candidate, the effects are seen over
time, not day-to-day.
   ``It's not one of these things when someone says, `Oh gee, he's
a good guy, let's buy stocks,''' Campbell said.
   Although the candidates may not directly influence Wall Street's
behavior, at least one forecaster contends the market's direction
can predict who will win the election, with uncanny accuracy.
   Yale Hirsch, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac, contends
the direction of the Dow Jones average between the close of the
last presidential convention and Election Day mirrors voter
sentiment.
   He bases the theory on the premise that of the the 14
presidential elections since 1900 in which the incumbents
triumphed, 12 were foretold by rising stock prices.
   In other words, if the Dow average is lower on Nov. 18 than its
2,027.03 level last Thursday, Dukakis will win. Conversely if the
average is higher, Bush will win.
   Whether pattern or happenstance, the
``Post-Convention-to-Election-Day Forecaster'' has its critics.
   ``It's an absurd game, but Hirsch takes this very seriously,''
said Robert Sobel, a market historian and author of several books
on Wall Street.
   ``From 1900 to 1960, in most elections, the presidential
candidate with the longer name won. That means Dukakis will beat
Bush.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Virtually Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished virtually unchanged Friday
in quiet, trendless trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 1-16 point, or about
63 cents for every $1,000 in face value.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an
indicator of interest rate trends, eased to 9.39 percent from 9.40
percent late Thursday.
   Prices opened firmer as traders speculated that strong buying
overnight in Japan might carry through to domestic trading.
   ``There were expectations of further Japanese buying, but when
that did not result, the speculators who bought in anticipation
sold,'' said Jay Goldinger, an economist at Capital Insight Inc. in
Beverly Hills, Calif. ``And that was the end of the day.''
   Trading was extremely light. ``There's nothing particular going
on, no news to move the market,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   Analysts said investors are laying low until the release of
fresh economic data next week. The government is scheduled to
report Tuesday on its Consumer Price Index and durable goods
orders, both for July.
   Prices of short-term government issues were unchanged,
intermediate maturities ranged from 1-32 point lower to [ point
higher, and 20-year issues picked up 1-32 point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, edged up 0.42 to 1,125.26.
   Corporate bonds were fractionally higher. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up
0.09 at 281.26.
   Three-month Treasury bills rose 3 basis points to a discounted
rate of 7.03 percent and a yield of 7.25 percent. Six-month bills
were unchanged at a discounted rate of 7.52 percent to yield 7.91
percent while one-year bills rose 1 basis point to 7.68 percent and
a yield of 8.24 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 1-16 percent, down from 8 3-16 percent late
Thursday.

   Cocoa futures prices dropped sharply Friday on unconfirmed
rumors the Ivory Coast had sold some of the 135,000 metric tons it
has been withholding from the market in hopes of selling at higher
prices.
   On other markets, crop futures finished lower; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; precious metals declined; energy futures
rallied; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The Ivory Coast, on Africa's northwestern shore, is the world's
largest cocoa producer and exporter, accounting for about one-third
of the 1.9 million metric tons of cocoa beans produced in the
1986-87 season.
   Its production for the current season, which ends Sept. 30, is
estimated at 620,000 metric tons but it has sold only 485,000,
according to a recent research report from Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   Analysts said that for the past several months the Ivory Coast
has been holding out for higher prices for the remainder of its
1987-88 cocoa.
   ``They have made one or two sales where dealers were prepared to
pay their high asking prices,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst
in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But harvesting of the new crop will begin late next month or
early in October, and ``their warehouse space is finite so a
substantial amount of this will have to come onto the market,''
Stevenson said.
   Unconfirmed rumors that the Ivory Coast had sold some of its
cocoa on Thursday caused panic selling of cocoa futures Friday on
the London Terminal Market, where prices plunged the permitted
daily limit.
   The price drop was not as steep on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange, but new life-of-contract lows were set for all
delivery months.
   In New York, cocoa settled $31 to $50 lower with the contract
for delivery in September at $1,321 per ton.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade after early excitement about a wheat offer to China
faded into a lackluster session.
   The Agriculture Department's announcement late Thursday it had
targeted China for sales of 2 million metric tons of subsidized
U.S. wheat gave the grain markets an early boost.
   But after that, ``there wasn't a lot of new news and the market
kind of slipped away,'' said Jerry Gidel, a grain market analyst
with G.H. Miller, a Chicago-based commodities trading division of
British-owned LIT America Inc.
   Wheat and corn futures finished slightly lower but soybeans
posted steeper losses on ideas that Friday's light showers and
cooler temperatures would benefit the struggling Midwestern soybean
crop. Afternoon readings in the region were mostly in the 70s but
temperatures in the 90s were expected to return early next week.
   Wheat settled { cent to 4 cents lower with September at $3.91} a
bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents lower with September at $2.87\
a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 6{ cents lower with September at
$2.59 a bushel; soybeans were 12\ cents lower to 2 cents higher
with August at $8.69{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid profit-taking and expectations of declining cash prices next
week, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Hog futures were mixed with strong cash markets offsetting fears
of increased slaughters next week, he said.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August
at 71.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .10
cent higher with August at 82.10 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent
lower to .67 cent higher with August at 48.07 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .10 cent to .85 cent higher with August 37 cents
a pound.
   Silver settled modestly lower while gold was nearly unchanged in
quiet trading on New York's Commodity Exchange. Uncertainty about
the direction of the dollar, inflation and interest rates limited
the activity, analysts said.
   Gold was 60 cents to 70 cents lower with October at $435.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2 cents lower with September at
$6.67 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices finished slightly higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in dull trading in the absence of any
significant news, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 16 cents
higher with September at $15.73 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent
to .48 cent higher with September at 44.48 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to .31 cent higher with September at 47.59
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .50 point higher at 261.95.

   A federal jury ended its fifth day of
deliberations Friday without reaching a verdict in the
multi-million dollar civil lawsuit brought against Texas oil tycoon
Nelson Bunker Hunt and his two younger brothers.
   U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker directed the three-man,
three-woman panel to resume deliberations at 9:30 a.m. Saturday.
   The jury spent much of the day rehearing testimony given in May
by Ismal Fonseca, a silver trader for Minpeco.
   Minpeco, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, is suing the Hunts for $150 million and seeking treble
damages under antitrust and civil racketeering statutes.
   The jury has been deliberating since Monday afternoon. The trial
began in February.
   Minpeco claims the three brothers _ Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62;
William Herbert Hunt, 59, who also has extensive real estate
holdings; and Lamar Hunt, 56, owner of the National Football League
Kansas City Chiefs _ conspired unsuccessfully with several Middle
East businessmen to corner the world silver market.
   The Hunts have denied the allegations.

   A late burst of computer-driven selling wiped
out measly gains in blue-chip stocks Friday and contributed to
another mixed finish on Wall Street, capping a sluggish week that
traders would just as soon forget.
   ``Nobody's committing any money,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager
of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``We're going to be in the doldrums for a while.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up slightly through
most of the day, weakened rapidly in the final minutes and ended
with an 11.03-point loss to 2,016.00, putting the index's decline
for the week at 21.52.
   Traders blamed the late reversal largely on computer-generated
selling programs linked to expiring stock options, which
contributed about 20 million shares to an otherwise dreary day on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Despite the loss in the Dow average, the broader market was
mixed. In composite NYSE trading, gaining issues held about a
4-to-3 edge over declines, with 794 up, 624 down and 522 unchanged.
   The fundamental reason for stock-market apathy is concern about
rising interest rates and the direction of the economy, in the
opinion of many market strategists. With Treasury bonds offering
increasingly attractive returns, investors aren't eager to risk
their money on Wall Street.
   ``If and when the market believes interest rates have peaked,
then we'll see renewed interest in stocks,'' said Robert Meyer,
director of research at the New York investment firm Fahnestock &
Co. ``When you can get fairly decent yields in short-term bonds,
it's pretty tough to compete.''
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 122.37 million shares,
down from 139.82 million the previous session and the lowest level
in more than three weeks. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on
the over-the-counter market, totaled 141.006 million shares.
   Declines in some of the big-name stocks helped drag down the Dow
average. DuPont fell 2[ to 78{, General Motors fell 2} to 72, IBM
fell 1~ to 112} and Minnesota Mining fell { to 60{.
   Besides IBM, some other computer and technology stocks suffered
big losses, notably Digital, which tumbled 2 to 92{, and Compaq,
down 1[ to 53|. In the over-the-counter market, Apple fell 1} to
40} on reports that its chairman, John Sculley, had sold nearly a
third of his stake in the company.
   Goodyear rose 2 to 60 after the company confirmed reports it
will sell the 1,750-mile All-American Pipeline to help pay debts.
Armtek rose 1 to 46{ on word that it was talking with possible
acquirers.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, fell by $3.26 billion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues fell 0.27 to
147.54.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.46 to 298.44, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.79 to 260.24.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.07
to 295.03. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 377.42, up 0.20.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed After Central Bank Intervention; Gold Ends Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Friday in quiet
trading after being tipped lower by central bank intervention that
continued for a third straight day.
   Gold prices weakened in late New York trading after rising in
the Far East and Europe. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid price for gold of $431.25 a troy ounce, down from $432
late Thursday.
   Analysts said the dollar was knocked down by sales by the
Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank. The Bundesbank
confirmed its intervention afterward, and traders reported it sold
dollars to buy West German marks when the U.S. currency hit around
1.8950 marks.
   The dollar finished in late New York trading at 1.8965 marks,
down from 1.8980 marks late Thursday.
   ``The intervention just kept a lid on the upside for the
dollar,'' said James Chorek, an analyst for MMS International, an
economic consulting firm in Chicago. ``It didn't really move the
market per se.''
   It was the third consecutive day of intervention by central
banks, which were successful in driving the U.S. currency lower
Thursday after being brushed off on Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.53 Japanese yen to close at 133.40 yen. Later in
London, it also was quoted at 133.40 yen. By the end of trading in
New York, the dollar had recovered to 133.69 yen, up from 133.40
yen late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7025 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6989 late
Thursday. Later, in New York, a pound was worth $1.6985, a bit
cheaper than $1.6990 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.5955 Swiss francs, up from 1.5945;
6.4190 French francs, down from 6.4470; 1,405.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,406.00; and 1.2300 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2295.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8925 West German marks, down from 1.8980;
1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5955; 6.4125 French francs, down
from 6.4340; 2.1390 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1438; 1,405.50
Italian lire, up from 1,402.75, and 1.2271 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2298.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $432 troy ounce, up
from Thursday's late bid of $431. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was
higher, closing at a bid $432.50, up from $431 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.93 to close at a bid $434.21.
   Gold for current delivery declined on the New York Commodity
Exchange to $431.70 a troy ounce from $432.30 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London, where the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.68 a troy ounce, up from late
Thursday's $6.66.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $6.657
a troy ounce from $6.675 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Strike Against Boise Cascade Ends After Workers Ratify Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. employees in three
Northwest states ended their 2-month-old strike against the
wood-products company Friday after ratifying a new three-year
contract.
   The pact was approved by a substantial margin of the estimated
2,000 union woodworkers eligible to vote, said Brad Witt, a
spokesman for the Western Council of Industrial Workers in Portland.
   Exact results of the vote taken Thursday were not released.
   The company, based in Boise, Idaho, will begin calling workers
back to their jobs Monday at 15 mills in Oregon, Washington and
Idaho, Witt said.
   The settlement was the second in the regional strike that began
June 6 and eventually spread to eight companies, affecting 9,000
workers. Workers at Willamette Industries Inc. of Portland ratified
a similar contract last week.
   The Boise Cascade pact, like Willamette's, includes a $1,400
signing bonus, a 3 percent raise in the second year and a 4 percent
raise in 1990. The Willamette pact differed in that it included a
fourth year with another 4 percent raise, Witt said.
   Journeyman-level workers at Boise Cascade also will receive an
additional 25-cent an hour raise.
   About 5,900 workers represented by the Western Council and the
International Woodworkers of America-U.S. remained on strike Friday
against six other Northwest wood-products companies with mills and
logging operations in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and
Northern California.
   Union officials also reported a tentative agreement Friday with
Georgia-Pacific Corp., one of the few large wood-products companies
in the region that was not struck.
   About 1,200 union workers for Georgia-Pacific in Oregon and
Northern California probably will vote on a new four-year pact next
week, said Bill Hubbell, president of the International Woodworkers.
   The other companies still affected by the strike are Simpson
Timber Co., Champion International Corp., DAW Forest Products Inc.,
WI Forest Products Inc., and two smaller Oregon operations:
Lakeview Lumber Co. and the Nicolai door plant operated by Morgan
Products Ltd. in Springfield.
   Progress was reported Friday in negotiations with Simpson Timber
and Champion International. Tentative settlements with those
companies may be announced within a week, Hubbell said.
   Champion International was ``fairly close to an agreement'' with
the unions, Hubbell added.
   Hubbell said the Georgia-Pacific, Simpson Timber and Champion
International contracts also were being negotiated along the lines
of Willamette's contract.
   The unions threatened in July to strike the region's largest
wood-products company, Weyerhaeuser Co. of Tacoma, Wash., but those
plans were postponed.

   Federal regulators merged eight insolvent Texas
savings and loans Friday, including the biggest first-quarter money
loser, into one institution that will be run by the government at a
record cost of $2.5 billion.
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board spokesman David Colgren said the
government estimates it will spend another $3 billion over the next
decade, bring its total infusion to $5.5 billion by 1998.
   The merger, outlined by the FHLBB, is the biggest under the
government's ``Southwest Plan,'' which is designed to eliminate
ailing S&Ls in the region through consolidations. It also
respresents the largest bailout in the thrift industry.
   The announcement comes a day after federal regulators said they
sold 12 insolvent S&Ls in Texas to an investment group headed by
William Gibson, a Continental Illinois Corp. vice president. The
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had promised to put up
$1.3 billion in government assistance, while the private sector
contributed $48 million in cash.
   The thrifts combined Thursday form the new institution of
American Federal Bank F.S.B., which will be based in Dallas.
   In the latest deal, the combined thrift will have assets of $6.9
billion and will be called Sunbelt Savings F.S.B., borrowing its
name from Dallas-based Sunbelt Savings Association, which was one
of the eight merged thrifts. Sunbelt lost $1.2 billion in the first
quarter of this year, a record for the industry.
   The new institution will be headed by Thomas J. Wageman, who has
been managing the state-chartered Sunbelt Savings Association for
the past two years.
   The FSLIC, which is providing a $2.5 billion note to eliminate
the losses of the consolidated institution, says it plans to shrink
Sunbelt's size with the intention of selling it to investors next
year.
   ``Once we finally implement consolidation and untangle the loan
participations, the surviving institutions will be much more
attractive to a buyer,'' FHLBB Chairman M. Danny Wall said in a
statement.
   ``It is in our best interest and that of depositors and others
in the Texas thrift industry for us to shrink these institutions to
their core business ...''
   The bank board said depositors of the eight merged thrifts will
be able to conduct business as usual because all branches of the
former institutions are now operating as officers of the new
Sunbelt. It said the same contracted rates and terms on all
certificates of deposit will continue to be honored.
   Besides Sunbelt Savings Association Texas, the other thrifts
involved were Western Federal Savings & Loan Association, a
Dallas-based S&L which ranked 12th in losses for the first quarter,
and Independent American Savings Association of Irving, ranked 20th
in first-quarter losses.
   The other institutions involved included: First City Savings
Association of Irving; Federated Savings & Loan of Brady; Multibanc
Savings Association of Alice; Texana Savings & Loan Association,
Texarkana; and Summit Savings Association of Dallas.
   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of
Dallas, said the consolidation is ``another FSLIC initiative to
stabilize the thrift industry in Texas,'' which has been hard hit
by slumping oil and real estate markets.
   The transaction brings to 20 the number of insolvent thrifts in
Texas that have been eliminated this week and 32 since the
Southwest Plan began three months ago. When the plan began, 109
Texas thrifts were insolvent.
   Wall said Thursday the FHLBB expected to complete the plan at
the end of the year.

<HEAD>Polaroid Says It Has More Suitors, Urges Voluntary Retirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. said Friday it has
received expressions of interest from several corporate suitors
other than Shamrock Holdings Inc. and Forstmann Little & Co., but
the company declined to name the potential bidders.
   Girding for a takeover battle, Polaroid said this week it would
offer early retirement to hundreds more employees, including a
quarter of its top executives. The Cambridge-based film products
firm also warned employees that layoffs may occur if the voluntary
incentives don't work.
   Wall Street analysts said they doubted the cost-cutting would
dissuade potential buyers.
   ``I think the news that they're going to cut another bulk of
their employees out is positive for the company. But will it stop a
takeover? Absolutely not,'' said Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``The thinking on Wall Street is: The likelihood of further
action on Polaroid stock by potential suitors is extremely high.
... There is too much smoke not to have some fire,'' Henderson said.
   Polaroid's board of directors voted unanimously Tuesday to
reject a hostile offer, valued at about $3 billion, from Shamrock
Holdings Inc., a California investment company controlled by Roy E.
Disney. The company also has rejected a friendly offer from
Forstmann Little, a New York investment firm.
   The warning of potential layoffs came from I. MacAllister Booth,
Polaroid's president and chief executive officer, in a question and
answer session with high-ranking executives on Wednesday.
   Portions of the session were replayed on videotape Thursday
before hundreds of employees at a meeting that the company says was
intended to be closed to the public but was attended by a Boston
Globe reporter.
   ``This company is like a family to me,'' Booth said on the
videotape. ``When my family gets attacked I fight ... and when my
company gets attacked, I fight, too.''
   As an incentive to retire, employees who leave now will be paid
through Nov. 30. ``If that doesn't work,'' Booth said, ``we will
have to rely on layoffs.''
   Referring to an earlier statement in which he had virtually
ruled out layoffs, Booth told the executives, ``I didn't expect to
be in this type of warfare when I made my pledge.''
   Asked about the suitors, Booth said, ``Forstmann Little, along
with lots of others, have talked to us.''
   A company spokesman said Friday that although Polaroid has
received routine letters and expressions of interest from potential
buyers, it is not actively discussing a takeover with anyone.
   The Boston Globe also reported the company increased its target
for the total number of retirements to 1,500.
   ``We do expect to streamline the workforce by a greater number
than what we had originally announced, which was 500 to 800, but I
can't confirm 1,500 or any other figure,'' company spokeswoman
Marcia Phillips said Friday.
   Phillips said Polaroid plans to issue ``a very detailed
statement'' on its restructuring in a few weeks, and ``It would be
premature to say very much before then.''
   Phillips said seven of Polaroid's 27 top executives have elected
to take early retirement.
   In previously announced defensive moves, Polaroid said it would
eliminate 500 to 800 people through voluntary retirements,
repurchase $300 million of its stock and issue 10 million new
shares for an employee stock ownership plan.
   That plan, which gives employees 14 percent control of Polaroid,
has been challenged by Shamrock in a Delaware court. Shamrock
opposes the plan because it would effectively allow employees to
block a takeover by voting with current management.

   In other economic and business developments this past week:
   _The Commerce Department reported the trade deficit swelled to
$12.5 billion in June as imports hit an all-time high. Economists
said the report shows how far the U.S. must still go to solve its
trade problems.
   _The government said housing starts rose a moderate 2.4 percent
in July, but analysts warned rising mortgage rates could slow the
pace of construction.
   _In other reports, the government said factories, mines and
utilities operated at 83.5 percent of capacity and industrial
production shot up 0.8 percent in July.
   _Government regulators announced two separate consolidations in
the troubled Texas savings and loan industry that could cost the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation more than $6
billion. The first merged 12 insolvent thrifts, and the second
covered eight troubled institutions, including Sunbelt Savings,
which by itself lost $1.2 billion in the first quarter.
   _A former Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker pleaded guilty to
engaging in a scheme in which he illicitly obtained advance copies
of Business Week and reaped profits from trading stocks mentioned
in the magazine. William Dillon was the first person to be
criminally charged in the insider-trading scandal involving
Business Week.
   _Upjohn Co. won federal approval to market the first hair-growth
formula in the United States. The drug, Rogaine, designed to
stimulate hair growth on men with male-pattern baldness, is
scheduled to hit the market in up to six weeks.
   _Whirlpool Corp. announced a joint venture that will make it the
world's biggest appliance concern. The company said it would
acquire a majority stake in the appliance division of Dutch
electronics giant NV Philips in a $470 million deal.
   _Officials of Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and Batus Inc. began
talks on Batus' proposal for a friendly $4.9 billion buyout. It was
the first time the two sides had met during their 8-month-old
takeover battle, but each company said it was prepared to continue
the fight.
   _Polaroid Corp. rejected a takeover offer from Roy E. Disney's
Shamrock Holdings Inc. valued at roughly $3 billion.
   _An investor group began a $2.69 billion hostile tender offer
for Interco Inc. after the furniture and apparel company rejected
the takeover proposal.
   _Armtek Corp. rejected a buyout bid from Mark IV Industries
Inc., which responded by sweetening its offer Armtek Corp. to $44 a
share, or about $550 million.
   _Westinghouse Electric Corp. agreed to pay an apparent-record
$35 million to settle an age-discrimination lawsuit brought by
employees denied severence pay after losing their jobs through
plant closings.
   _DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group Inc., hit by a string of box
office flops, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   _The Belgian company Donnay SA, once the world's top maker of
tennis rackets, was declared bankrupt after failing to reach a deal
with its creditors.
