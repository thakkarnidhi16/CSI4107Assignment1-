   A Roman Catholic priest was charged
Tuesday with sexually assaulting two altar boys over a six-year
period.
   Police said The Rev. Robert G. Wolk, 48, former pastor of St.
Thomas More Roman Catholic Church in suburban Bethel Park, engaged
in sexual activities with the youths, now 20 and 18 years old,
between March 1981 and May 1987 at the parish house. They also
contend the activities occurred in the guest house of the Sisters
of the Holy Spirit in suburban Allison Park.
   ``Other unnamed Catholic priests, in conjunction with Father
Wolk, participated and engaged in the same sexual misconduct in
other areas of southwestern Pennsylvania,'' police said.
   ``These other unnamed Catholic priests conducted
sado-masochistic rituals on several young males,'' they said.
   Wolk, who is now a resident of St. Luke's Institute of Suitland,
Md., a psychiatric care facility for priests, was charged with four
counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and two counts
each of attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and
corruption of minors.
   Allegheny County District Attorney Robert Colville said he will
seek Wolk's extradition.
   Diocesan spokesman Rev. Ron Lengwin said church officials first
learned of the allegations from one of the reported victims on
Sept. 22, 1987, and Wolk was interviewed immediately and removed
from his assignment two days later.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, winding through Midwestern farm land on a bus tour, said
Tuesday that Democrat Michael Dukakis had never ``owned up to his
irresponsible conduct'' in the Massachusetts prison furlough
program.
   At every stop through the flat, fertile countryside near his
home state of Indiana, speakers portrayed Quayle as a ``son of the
heartland,'' and he told flag-waving crowds that their
old-fashioned values would be preserved in a George Bush presidency.
   A crowd of several hundred supporters gave Quayle a thunderous
ovation at a homestate rally in Indianapolis on Tuesday night.
   But reporters traveling with the senator got no welcome at all.
The crowd chanted, ``Just say no!'' as they entered the hall.
Reporters were also booed after the Republican convention at a
Bush-Quayle rally in Huntington, Ind., Quayle's hometown, as they
attempted to question him about his military record.
   Quayle had a fighter's message for the Indianapolis group: ``We
plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen. But in the
end, we'll get the job done. We have just begun to fight.''
   Earlier in Ohio, the senator spoke of the importance of that
state, which has 23 electoral votes and is viewed as an important
swing state in the November elections.
   ``The eyes of America in this election Nov. 8 will be on Ohio
and the Midwest,'' Quayle told a rally in Van Wert.
   In Napoleon, Quayle responded to Dukakis' complaints about how
the GOP ticket was portraying the prison furlough program in
Massachusetts and the case of Willie Horton Jr., a convicted
murderer who escaped from a 1986 urlough and attacked a Maryland
couple the following year.
   Dukakis said he resented being portrayed as insensitive to the
plight of crime victims, and noted that members of his own family
had been victimized in the past.
   The Massachusetts governor said people such as Horton, who had
ben sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole,
could not be furloughed under current state law.
   Interviewed Tuesday on NBC's ``Today'' show, Dukakis criticized
Bush for making a campaign issue of prison furloughs. ``To use
these human tragedies for your own political purposes, I think, is
really a very crass and cynical thing,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee said crimes similar to the Horton case
had been committed under the federal furlough program and in
California, where furloughs were initiated in the 1970s when
President Reagan was governor of that state.
   But Quayle decried on Tuesday what he called Dukakis' ``sorry
record of dealing with violent crime.''
   ``Even after the Horton case, the governor strenuously defended
the furlough program. He did not act to change it,'' Quayle said,
adding correctly that the Massachusetts law was changed only under
pressure from the state Legislature.
   Quayle said 62 criminals are listed as missing or escapees from
Massachusetts furlough and early release programs.
   He said Dukakis had failed to heed the advice of a special state
commission which said in 1975 it could find no justification for
prison furloughs.
   State officials say there actually are 11 people classified as
escaped from a furlough program _ 10 of them from before 1979 _ and
20 more considered escaped from work release programs.
   As for the special state commission, Andrew Dreyfus, spokesman
for state Human Services Secretary Philip Johnston said there was a
commission that looked at a range of furlough issues and drafted a
bill that was pocket vetoed by the governor in 1976.
   Dreyfus said the bill changed the eligibility rules for
furloughs for first-degree-murder lifers but did not ban them.
Under the new policy adopted earlier this year, there's no furlough
for first-degree lifers whatsoever.
   ``He has not truly and sincerely owned up to his irresponsible
conduct,'' Quayle said.
   Behind the scenes, a Quayle aide who insisted on anonymity said
the candidate met with Bush campaign James A. Baker III over the
weekend and complained about anonymous quotes from within the Bush
camp that he was a liability to the ticket. Quayle had said openly
last Friday after the vice presidential debate that he would like
to find out who made those remarks, adding, ``I think I might have
some influence on their job security.''
   At rallies throughout the day-long bus tour, Quayle sounded
themes aimed at what he called ``heartland'' citizens. He accused
Dukakis of being soft on crime and belonging to a radical left-wing
organization, which is how Quayle characterized the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``Right and wrong is at the very core of life in this beloved
Midwest region that I grew up in and where you live,'' he told the
Napoleon crowd. ``The values of this region have not left me.''
   The trip wound through cornfields from Napoleon to Ottawa, Van
Wert, Celina and Greenville along Ohio's western border.

<HEAD>Split in Governing Party Formalized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissident faction within the
governing Christian Democrats has formally split with the party,
further weakening the party as it faces a challenge from the right.
   The group, led by former Cabinet minister Julio Adolfo Rey
Prendes, filed with the Central Elections Council on Monday to
establish the Authentic Christian Movement, or MAC. It also
incorporated a tiny rightist party.
   The petition is expected to be approved in a matter of days.
   ``We control 80 percent of the structure and organization of the
Christian Democratic Party nationwide,'' Rey Prendes told
journalists at the Elections Council.
   Rey Prendes lost the Christian Democratic nomination for the
March 1989 presidential election to Fidel Chavez Mena, also a
former Cabinet Minister. President Jose Napoleon Duarte, and old
friend and mentor of Rey Prendes, was unable to mend the rift.
   The division weakens the Christian Democrats, who have governed
since 1984 but face an uphill battle in the election against the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, known by its Spanish
acronym Arena.
   Arena won 32 seats in the 60-seat legislature in elections last
March. It also won control of two thirds of El Salvador's
municipalities.
   Rey Prendes said his group hoped to finish second in the first
round of the presidential election, which will probably be decided
in a runoff.
   Arena is considered likely to get the biggest share of the vote,
but not a majority, in the first round.
   The Christian Democratic split produces a confusing situation in
the legislature. Seventeen of the party's 22 legislators are loyal
to Rey Prendes. How the new faction will vote remains to be seen.
   Duarte, who is suffering from terminal cancer, told journalists
Saturday the split was ``a shame ... but now it's a fact, and we
just have to press ahead.''

<HEAD>Panama To Boycott Canal Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama will boycott a Panama Canal
Commission meeting because the United States invited an ambassador
loyal to ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle and denied entry
visas for two delegates, an official said.
   Oyden Ortega, one of four Panamanian delegates to the
commission, told a news conference Monday the United States had
invited Juan B. Sosa, whom it recognizes as Panama's ambassador to
Washington, to attend the Oct. 12-13 meeting in New Orleans.
   He said Sosa's presence ``introduces an element of politics into
the Canal Commission meetings, and an institutional meeting would
have been preferable.''
   Ortega said Panama would send a document to U.S. commission
members stating that its decision to boycott the meeting did not
affect Panama's compliance with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.
   The commission oversees administration of the canal until Dec.
31, 1999, when Panama is to assume full responsibility for the
waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Sosa served as Panama's envoy under Delvalle, who was deposed in
February after he tried to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler as head of the Defense Forces, is
under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges. Noriega denies
any wrongdoing.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.
   Ortega said the United States denied a visa to Maj. Daniel
Delgado, Panama's executive director for treaty affairs, for what
he called ``political declarations against the United States.''
Delegate Arnulfo Suarez also was denied a U.S. visa, but Ortega
declined to say why.
   In July, Panama ordered its commission representatives not to
attend a scheduled meeting in Savannah, Ga., because of U.S.
sanctions against Noriega.
   In the Panamanians' absence, the five American members voted to
suspend commission regulations calling for at least two of its four
annual meetings to be held in Panama.

<TEXT>
   The primary plutonium processing facility at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant outside Denver has been shut down
because of a ``minor safety incident'' that happened last month,
the Department of Energy said.
   The DOE and Rockwell International Corp., which operates the
plant under contract for the DOE, said there was no leak of
radioactive material.
   ``There was no release of any radioactive material in the
building, nor any threat to the public or the environment,''
Rockwell said in a news release.
   But the DOE said three people were tested for ``potential health
effects.'' Neither the DOE nor Rockwell on Saturday said why the
employees underwent health tests.
   The Rocky Flats plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons, and the affected building processes manufacturing wastes
back to pure plutonium.
   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz said Monday the shutdown would not
affect production elsewhere at the plant. He said the building's
575 employees would not be laid off during the shutdown. The plant
employs 5,000 people.
   However, Richard W. Starostecki, the DOE's top safety expert,
said in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of The New
York Times, that the shutdown was in a building where classified
work vital to the entire plant's operation is performed. The
shutdown essentially halts all production at the plant, the
official said in Washington.
   The incident occurred Sept. 29 in Building 771 at the plant 16
miles northwest of Denver, and the DOE said activities in the
building were halted Saturday.
   Heintz would not elaborate on the incident. He said it would be
up to the DOE to decide when the building reopens, and a restart
team was formed Saturday.
   Starostecki said the order came about after a DOE inspector and
two Rockwell employees were contaminated by plutonium when they
unwittingly walked into an unmarked room where maintenance and
cleanup work was being performed on plutonium contaminated
equipment.
   Rockwell will conduct a semi-annual inventory of nuclear
materials in the building during the shutdown, the DOE said.
   The DOE said Rockwell curtailed maintenance and construction
activities in the building last Tuesday to review the situation.
The review determined, among other things, that airborne
radioactive contamination levels were within DOE-Environmental
Protection Agency guidelines, but higher than DOE goals.
   Early this year, a DOE team reported ``serious concerns'' with
radiation monitoring practices at the weapons plant. The team spent
a week auditing the plant and plutonium processing, paying what it
termed close attention to the calibration of plant radiation
measurement equipment.
   At another nuclear weapons plant, the Savannah River Plant near
Aiken, S.C., it was disclosed last week that up to 30 significant
mishaps occurred at the plant over the past three decades, and that
many had not been reported to Washington or disclosed to the public.
   All three reactors at the Savannah River Plant have been shut
down since August when a mishap idled one of the reactors. The
plant makes two materials used in nuclear weapons, plutonium and
tritium.

Beijing Jeep Corp., now partly owned by Chrysler.
   Iacocca arrived Monday on a six-day visit which will also
include a visit to the northeastern city of Changchun, home of the
First Automobile Works.
   Chrysler and the Changchun firm signed an agreement last year to
set up a new factory using an assembly line from Chrysler's
Trenton, Mich., plant that will produce four-cylinder engines.
   Chrysler gained a 31 percent equity interest in Beijing Jeep
when it acquired American Motors Corp. last year. AMC and the
Beijing Automobile Works set up the joint venture in 1983.
   Beijing Jeep employs 4,300 people and this year plans to produce
about 30,000 vehicles _ 25,500 BJ212's and more than 4,000 Jeep
Cherokees.
   Plant officials presented Iacocca with a BJ212, a light-duty
four-wheel-drive vehicle with a maximum speed of about 60 mph.

   Police said they believe arsonists were
responsible for a fire that damaged a door at the consular and
cultural section of the Algerian Embassy in London.
   Scotland Yard said in a statement that the fire extensively
damaged the door at the building at Hyde Park Gate in the center of
London. The consular and cultural section is about a mile from the
main embassy building at Holland Park.
   The brief Scotland Yard statement gave no indication whether the
blaze Monday night was linked with the current wave of violence in
Algeria over austerity measures.
   Embassy staff could not be contacted as the building was closed
for the night. The Scotland Yard statement gave no indication how
the fire was started.
   In Algeria on Monday, soldiers with machine guns fired into a
crowd of more than 10,000 in the Bab-el-Oued district of the
capital Algiers and eyewitnesses said they killed at least 25
people and injured dozens more.
   Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid in a nationwide address
Monday night promised reforms to end the week-long revolt over
economic policies. He defended his declared state of emergency and
said he would ``not allow the country to fall into anarchy.''
   Bendjedid has been the main advocate of an economic austerity
program aimed at forcing Algeria to live within its means in the
face of falling oil and gas prices.

   The Agriculture Department has a new cookbook
this fall for school cafeterias which includes some new recipes,
labor-saving tips and a little pizazz for the pinto beans.
   In all, there are 161 recipes in the revised publication,
``Quantity Recipes for Type A School Lunches,'' the first new model
since 1971.
   School meals are served to 24 million children in 90,000 schools
across the country.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode says ``food service has changed
dramatically'' since the previous recipes were issued 17 years ago.
The new ones, he says, feature more optional ingredients and
seasonings to reflect regional food preferences.
   The recipes were developed over two years under a $320,000
contract, plus another year and $2 million to print and distribute
90,000 copies free to state agencies and regional offices.
Development included surveys of state agencies, a taste panel and
test schools.
   Under the lunch program, USDA provides about $3.7 billion in
cash grants and commodity donations to participating school
districts.
   The per-pupil costs of meals can vary greatly. USDA provides
subsidies according to the family income of school children. Those
subsidies range from about $1.60 per meal for meals provided free
of charge to poverty-level homes to less than 27 cents per meal for
children from affluent families.
   According to the department's Food and Nutrition Service, the
new ``recipe file'' includes variations of recipes where
appropriate and ``makes good use of USDA-donated commodities to
help keep down the cost of lunches.''
   Some nutrition experts have criticized school menus for allowing
too much fat, sugar and salt in the meals. One group, Public Voice
for Food and Health Policy, recently said that while school meals
have improved they still fall short of USDA's own dietary
guidelines.
   The agency's report said that ``to the extent practical and
acceptable, moderation of added sugar, fat and salt'' was taken
into consideration when the revised recipes were drafted.
   ``However, no arbitrary levels of any one ingredient was
specified in the contract,'' the report said. `` The recipes were
never intended to be therapeutic in nature.''
   The report added, ``Certainly, added sugar, fat and salt was a
major consideration, but they were also balanced with the many
other constraints inherent in quantity food production systems and,
in particular, to the uniqueness of school feeding programs and
their regulated meal patterns.''
   About half of the 161 recipes in the new file are ``popular
revisions'' of ones in the old set.
   ``Schools continue to serve spaghetti, lasagna and oatmeal
cookies,'' the report said. ``All recipes were restandardized.
Improved preparation methods and ingredient choices were
incorporated into the recipes, keeping in mind the need to work
efficiently and still please student appetites.''
   The contract specified that recipes not only be acceptable but
accommodate regional and local needs and preferences. Where
possible, alternative ingredients are allowed, such as the use of
pinto or kidney beans in the chili con carne recipe.
   ``For example, cheddar cheese is a suggested garnish for the
chili, and canned green chili peppers may be used (or not used) in
cornbread and nacho cheese sauce,'' the report said. ``And because
Mexican and Italian flavors rank so high in children's food
preferences, master seasoning mix recipes have been included, which
can be adjusted to accommodate local food preferences.''
   A ``nutrients per serving'' table gives the values for 15
different nutrients on all recipes.
   The agency said the recipes also ``eliminate as many preparation
steps and pieces of cooking equipment as possible'' and lists
``labor-saving alternative ingredients such as dehydrated onions.''

<HEAD>Sanctions Cut US Purchases, Investment in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 against
South Africa have begun to bite into U.S. buying and investment
there, congressional investigators say.
   Congress imposed the sanctions because of South Africa's policy
of racial discrimination against its non-white majority, overriding
a veto by President Reagan in the process.
   The congressional General Accounting Office analyzed data for
the first nine months of 1987, and found that South Africa's major
exports to the United States declined by $417 million compared with
the same period the year before. The biggest losses were in iron
and steel and uranium.
   Twenty-three industrialized and newly industrializing countries
are major South African trading partners, but the others have not
taken up the slack, the GAO found.
   ``South Africa has not been able to replace its former exports
to the United States of these commodities by redirecting trade to
the other 22 nations and has suffered further losses in exports to
these countries as well,'' said the report to Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., both of whom supported the
sanctions.
   The total loss in South African sales was put at $469 million.
The report listed West Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Hong Kong
as making the deepest cuts after the United States. Their
reductions were considerably less than those of the United States,
however. The biggest drop, just under $70 million, was in West
German purchases.
   South African sales would have fallen even more had Taiwan not
gone against the trend and increased its purchases by $164 million,
the report said.
   U.S. investments in South Africa also fell in 1987, the report
found, although total U.S. investment is still up from the level of
1984.
   U.S. investments in South Africa increased nearly 10 percent
from 1984 to 1986 _ from $2.04 billion to $2.23 billion _ before
declining in 1987, after sanctions were imposed, by about 5 percent
to $2.12 billion.
   ``Despite more than half of U.S. companies withdrawing since
1984, the value of U.S. direct investments in South Africa ... has
increased 4 percent,'' the report said. ``This increase is largely
the result of significant reinvested earnings.''
   In 1987 American companies reinvested $94 million of their
profits in South Africa. The sanctions law banned new investment.

   The failure of Congress to agree on revisions
to the Clean Air Act leaves more than a hundred polluted cities and
rural areas and their state governments ``in a never-never land,''
says one of their Washington representatives.
   These are the areas _ all urban except for five rural counties
in Maine _ that didn't meet the deadline last Dec. 31 for complying
with federal clean air standards for ozone and carbon monoxide.
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it will now go ahead
with requirements for steady progress toward the standards, with
punishments for those who thumb their noses. Don Clay, acting
assistant administrator for air pollution programs, said last week
that the agency hopes to adopt its long-discussed policy by the end
of the year.
   Bill Becker, executive director of the Association of State and
Territorial Air Pollution Control Administrators, said in an
interview he doubts that EPA can act that quickly.
   ``We're not asking EPA to sit idly by and do nothing. But it
should be Congress and not EPA that decides for how long the
deadline should be extended,'' he said.
   ``The real danger is that Congress will not act next year,
either,'' Clay said. ``The agency would be derelict in its duty if
it did not go ahead.''
   Becker said he believes a presidential victory for Michael
Dukakis would be more likely than a George Bush victory to produce
an EPA leadership that would insist on its own look at the policy.
   All the major proposals Congress considered would have extended
compliance deadlines by varying periods according to the
seriousness of the local air pollution problem. Some areas might
have won 15 more years.
   Some members of Congress, backed up by the General Accounting
Office, argue that EPA is required to act against cities that
failed to meet the standards.
   EPA, however, maintains that the law does not mean sanctions for
simple failure to meet the numbers, but for failure to submit a
plan showing how the numbers would be met.
   The agency plans to ban construction of major new sources of
ozone-forming pollution in 12 areas and has already done so in
three _ greater Los Angeles, greater Chicago and Ventura County,
Calif. The Sacramento area is next, with action expected about Dec.
1.
   The other areas are Cleveland; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Indiana
suburbs of Louisville, Ky.; Atlanta; Denver; Reno, Nev.; and in
California, Kern and Fresno counties.
   It's not clear how much of a punishment this is. It covers only
plants emitting more than 100 tons a year of chemicals that form
ozone. The agency also may withhold federal highway aid and certain
other money in some circumstances.
   ``Mayors and city officials should not be fearful that EPA will
impose sanctions for failure to attain (the standards), but there
is the possibility some group may sue'' the agency over its
interpretation, Becker said.
   EPA's arsenal of plans, according to Becker, contains many
useful weapons, but ``We had reservations about EPA saying `You're
responsible ... independently of political considerations,
independently of resource constraints.'''
   Last November EPA unveiled a draft of its plans in case Congress
failed to act, starting with a call for new control plans from the
states.
   To win EPA's approval, those plans were supposed to show an
annual average reduction in the major pollutants or their
precursors of 3 percent per year.
   That's tough because the 3 percent reduction would have to come
in addition to any reductions that resulted from measures that EPA
requires for the whole country.
   Clay declined to say last week whether the 3 percent figure
would survive in the final regulation. But he did say the concept
of ``steady progress'' would be incorporated.
   Becker's group argued that a uniform 3 percent requirement is
too tough, and that it should be tailored to the locality. ``It may
be that federal measures will do 80 percent of the job in some
areas and only 20 percent in others,'' he said.
   Examples of the federal measures are tighter gasoline volatility
limits and refueling vapor recovery systems for cars that EPA says
it plans to require by the end of this year.
   Gasoline vapor is a major smog-forming raw material, and EPA now
believes these two measures could reduce smog formation by 20
percent or 30 percent in some dirty areas.
   New York, New Jersey and the six New England states are adopting
strict volatility limits on their own, effective next summer, and
are planning to adopt the California auto exhaust standards,
stricter than the federal requirements.

   Broadcasters and free-speech defenders say a
new law that will ban ``indecent'' material from radio and
television is unconstitutional and they are preparing to challenge
the measure in court.
   Congress passed the blanket prohibition because of complaints by
some lawmakers that the Federal Communications Commission was
allowing the airwaves to be sullied with smut.
   The fact that this is an election year, however, did not go
unnoticed, others in Congress say.
   ``It's an election-year fear,'' said Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa,
who argued on the House floor that a ban would be found
unconstitutional. ``It was just a fear that someone might think
they were for pornography or obscenity.''
   Obscenity is banned on radio and TV at all times. But the FCC
allows a category of less offensive material _ termed ``indecent''
_ to be broadcast when children are unlikely to be listening or
watching.
   ``We're not talking about obscenity, but material that has a lot
of societal value _ artistic, literary, even political merit _ and
because the definition is so broad it could be considered
indecent,'' said Timothy B. Dyk, a lawyer representing
freedom-of-speech advocates.
   The FCC had set midnight to 6 a.m. as a safe harbor for the
so-called indecent material, but a federal appeals court in
Washington last summer said the commission failed to make a case
for those hours and ordered a review.
   The new law appears to make that review moot. Now the FCC must
come up with a new set of rules to ban indecency by Jan. 31, 1989.
Over-the-air broadcasts, but not cable programming, would be
covered.
   Representatives of broadcasting companies, First Amendment
advocates and civil liberties defenders that earlier challenged the
FCC's indecency rules met recently to discuss the impending ban,
said Dyk, lead attorney in the appeals court case.
   ``It's safe to predict that some or all of the original group
will challenge'' the new law, he said.
   In the earlier case, decided July 29 by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court ``makes plain that
banning indecent material during the entire 24-hour period is
plainly unconstitutional,'' Dyk said.
   The Senate passed the ban in July after its sponsor, Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., alleged that the FCC was permitting broadcasters to
air programs that included ``disgusting bestiality, sodomy and
child sex.''
   ``Garbage is garbage no matter what the time of day or night may
be,'' Helms said on the Senate floor. He offered no specifics.
   The FCC last year lowered its window for the so-called indecent
broadcasts, moving the cutoff time from 10 p.m. to midnight. The
commission had refrained from an around-the-clock ban because it
said court rulings have held that the First Amendment protects
indecent speech, allowing restrictions only to keep such material
away from children.
   Peggy Charren, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Action
for Children's Television, agreed that election-year politics
clearly is behind the new prohibition on indecency.
   ``Pornography is one thing. Nobody's for that, but that's not
what is being talked about here. Indecency is not child
pornography,'' she said.
   ``People who worry about keeping speech away from children are
the kind of people who burn books, who re-edit textbooks, who want
to torch television programs and that is never the way to deal with
a speech problem for anybody, including children,'' she said.
   Charren's group was one of the many involved in the appeals
court case decided in July _ two days after the Senate passed its
ban. It cited a 1978 Supreme Court ruling in reaffirming that
indecent speech ``is protected by the First Amendment.''
   It also upheld the FCC's definition of indecency as material
that ``depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   Even some at the FCC are concerned about the constitutionality
of the new ban, but FCC Commissioner James H. Quello said: ``It's
law and we have to enforce it.''
   ``I'm for everything we can do to curb obscenity, but this might
be going farther than the Constitution intended,'' he said.

   Vice President George Bush, seeking to exploit
Americans' crime fears as a campaign weapon, is turning prison
inmate Willie Horton Jr. into a symbol of what he calls opponent
Michael Dukakis' liberal views.
   It was Horton who, while on furlough from the Massachusetts
prison where he was serving time for murder, brutally slashed a
Maryland man and twice raped his fiancee last year. He is now
behind bars in Maryland.
   Because Dukakis, as Massachusetts governor, was in charge of the
prison system at the time, Bush sees the Horton incident as a
political mother lode. While polls place crime somewhere in the
middle of voters' concerns, it is closely linked to the drug issue,
which rides atop the worry list.
   National crime statistics released this weekend show crime up
1.8 percent last year, ending a five-year decline. And 34.7 million
people were victimized by criminals _ nearly one in three American
households.
   ``It has tremendous saliency,'' said GOP political consultant
Eddie Mahe. ``It ties into the drug issue so closely. Everybody
knows the drug problem is driving the crime problem through the
roof.''
   Bush had made crime _ and Horton in particular _ the basis for
anti-Dukakis campaign speeches and a television spot highlighting
the crime issue, and he has recruited Horton's victim _ Cliff
Barnes, who was cut 22 times in the stomach _ as a campaign
surrogate. Deputy Bush press secretary Mark Goodin even keeps a
photo of Horton on the wall in his office.
   ``I didn't ask to be brought into this,'' Barnes said Monday at
a news conference in Texas. ``I didn't invite Willie Horton to my
House and I didn't let him out of prison.''
   The attack has been going on for weeks, and Dukakis was at first
slow to respond. But now the Democratic campaign is fighting back
and hoping the emotionalism of Bush's message will backfire by
Election Day.
   Over the weekend, Dukakis called Bush ``shameless'' for using
crime victims to win votes.
   ``Unlike Mr. Bush, I've been a chief executive on the front
lines of fighting crime. Unlike Mr. Bush, who will not take
responsibility for anything, I as chief executive took full
responsibility for that tragic Horton case and acted to change that
policy,'' Dukakis said, referring to his signing of a state law in
April revoking furloughs for first-degree murderers.
   Dukakis also has put together a television spot that seeks to
shove the issue back at Bush. The ad cites a 1981 rape and murder
carried out by an inmate staying at a Houston halfway house that
Bush helped start while he was a congressman.
   Dukakis says two similar murders occurred under the California
furlough system in the early 1970s, at a time when Ronald Reagan,
then state governor, supported furloughs.
   Dukakis also points to a 13 percent drop in violent crime in
Massachusetts since 1982, the largest decline among major
industrial states. He says that as the state's chief executive, he
had to face real problems of running the Massachusetts prison
system, while Bush has never been tested on the issue.
   Far from being out of the mainstream, the Massachusetts law
allowing prison furloughs is in line with the rest of the nation. A
1987 national survey found that all 50 states, the District of
Columbia and the federal prison system have some provision for
granting short-term furloughs for prisoners, and two-thirds of them
permit furloughs for prisoners serving life terms.
   Bush's use of the issue is ``an oversimplification of a real
complex thing,'' said Emily Herrick, an editor with Contact Inc.,
the non-profit criminal justice information organization that
conducted the survey.
   More than 200,000 furloughs were granted last year for 53,000
inmates, the survey found. No murders were reported. All but three
states _ Hawaii, Oregon and North Carolina _ had success rates in
excess of 90 percent, meaning the inmates returned at the appointed
time and place without violating terms of the furlough.
   Bush hit the crime issue again Monday, renewing his proposals to
create an anti-gang unit in the Justice Department, spend more
money to build prisons and bolster programs to compensate crime
victims.
   ``I think there is something very wrong when there is so much
sympathy for criminals and very little left over for victims,''
Bush told a campaign crowd in Trenton, N.J. ``Frankly, law-abiding
Americans are fed up with the cruel and unusual punishment
inflicted on them by those who are soft on crime.''
   Despite his rhetoric, Bush has been short on specifics. Asked
what he would do about the furlough issue, the vice president has
said only that as president he would have his attorney general
review the federal prison system's policies.
   ``I don't have any specific feelings at all,'' he said, although
he said he wants to make sure the federal system doesn't ``slip
into the Massachusetts model.''

   An 8,000-pound pressurized lid
shot through the roof of an aerospace manufacturing plant Monday in
an explosion that killed two people and injured four others,
authorities said.
   The explosion at Reinhold Industries occurred about 2:30 p.m.
when contractors were testing a hydroclave steam-pressure unit used
in the production of aerospace components, said Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla.
   ``It was like being in a war,'' said city fire Capt. Phil Pepin.
``This building just blew up and there were fragments of sheet
metal going everywhere.''
   As pressure was being increased during installation of the
machine, the lid blasted loose and shot 25 feet through the sheet
metal roof, Pepin said.
   ``There were wires arcing. All the machinery inside was torn
apart and all the windows were blown out,'' the captain said,
adding that pieces of metal and piping were hurled as far as 100
feet.
   Pepin said firefighters were at the plant for a routine
inspection when the blast occurred. Investigators were still at the
scene five hours later. Five other hydroclave units were undamaged
and operating, Wahla said.
   One critically injured burn victim was flown to the burn center
at Torrance Memorial Hospital and the three others were taken to
local hospitals, Wahla said. Names of the dead and injured were not
immediately released.
   The blast caused telephone and electrical outages in the area 15
miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``One portion of the building was totally demolished where the
equipment went through part of the roof,'' said fire Marshall Stan
Boettcher. He added that unseasonable temperatures in the high 90s
didn't appear to have contributed to the explosion.
   ``Heat is developed in their manufacturing process so I don't
think climatic heat had anything to do with it.''
   Boettcher said the company made airplane propellers and nose
caps and nose cones for rockets and aircraft.
   About 580 customers were briefly without electricity after the
blast, said Pat Messigian, a Southern California Edison
spokeswoman. Power was restored in 25 minutes, she said.

   Singer Stevie Wonder helped comfort the
family of a slain friend by attending her funeral.
   Wonder showed up at St. Ann Church on Saturday for the funeral
of Pamela Johnson, 32, who was stabbed to death Oct. 1 in Los
Angeles.
   ``Stevie eased my heart,'' said Ms. Johnson's mother, Irene.
``She is my only child. I have a lot of pain.''
   ``His presence was very uplifting and affirming of the family,''
said the Rev. Martin Donnelly.
   He said Wonder and two companions arrived several minutes after
the service began and slipped into the last pew of the church.
   Later, at Mrs. Johnson's request, Wonder gave a eulogy in which
he pledged to see that Ms. Johnson's 11-year-old daughter, Kalisha,
was provided for, and sang a song.
   Rod McGrew, one of Wonder's representatives at Black Bull Music
Inc. in Burbank, Calif., said Ms. Johnson was a friend of Wonder's.
   McGrew said he was not aware of the circumstances surrounding
Ms. Johnson's death.

   Texas Democrats watched in dismay the past
several weeks as Republican presidential nominee George Bush
pounded rival Michael Dukakis on gun control, crime and the Pledge
of Allegiance.
   But in the wake of vice presidential nominee and Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen's debate success, Democrats say the Lone Star state _
and its third largest Election Day prize of 29 electoral votes _
once again is up for grabs.
   ``I was kind of down in the dumps a couple of weeks ago. We were
pinned down on the beach for a while. But now we're getting air
support and we're going to drive those folks back,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.
   Hours after last week's vice presidential debate, Dukakis and
Bentsen campaigned in East Texas while the Democratic ticket
unleashed new ads rebutting Bush's claim that Dukakis is soft on
crime.
   The commercials recount the story of a prison inmate who in 1981
raped and murdered a woman while he was staying at a Houston
halfway house that Bush _ then a Houston congressman _ helped start.
   The ads are in response to the case of Willie Horton, a
convicted felon who brutalized a Maryland couple while he was on a
weekend pass from a Massachusetts prison.
   Republicans, however, suggest that the Democratic ticket has run
aground in Texas and is weighing a retreat.
   ``The numbers that we are seeing is that he (Dukakis) is
continuing to slide,'' said Mark Sanders, Bush's campaign spokesman
in Texas.
   A poll conducted last week by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
in 15 Southern and border states found Bush leading Dukakis by 14
percentage points in Texas.
   Rumors that the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign is considering
withdrawing its forces are just that, according to the Democratic
Party.
   ``That's the kind of rumor that comes from Republican campaign
managers who must have been snorting something (Panama strongman
Manuel Antonio) Noriega sent them,'' Martin said.
   Campaign '88, which is the ticketwide Democratic Party campaign,
has 110 paid staffers, most of them working in the field, said
Matthew Dowd, director of operations.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen campaign has 13 paid staffers in the state.
   The party plans to spend about $3 million in advertising in the
final weeks of the campaign, but that money is separate from the
public funds the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket will receive, Dowd said.
   ``This race is going to be close; it's going right down to the
wire. If we can put Texas in that Democratic column, and I'm
convinced we will, then we're going to win this election,'' Bentsen
said last week while campaigning in Dallas.
   The Texas senator also is running for re-election this year
under a state law passed in 1959 that allowed Lyndon B. Johnson to
run for the Senate while campaigning for national office.
   Dukakis state campaign manager Tom Cosgrove said Dukakis has
been picking up momentum in Texas since before the first
presidential debate Sept. 25.
   Democrats say the vice presidential debate was a knockout win
for Bentsen, especially his ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy''
putdown of GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle. That was the
kind of tough jab that plays well in Texas, they said.
   Democratic Party pollster Al Quinlan said the ticket has
improved since the debates.
   ``It's a combination of doubts about Quayle, and partially the
fact that Dukakis has put the campaign on track. The Bush onslaught
seems to have worn thin about eight to 10 days ago. There are a lot
of Reagan Democrats that are coming home,'' Quinlan said.
   No Democrat has ever won the White House without winning Texas.
   Republicans, though, boast that Bush will face little difficulty
in the Lone Star state.
   ``I don't think it is particularly competitive. If we continue
to do what we've been doing there's no way we can lose it,'' Bush
campaign manager Lee Atwater said last week.
   The Texas Bush campaign and the fund-raising Victory '88
organization has 44 paid staffers, 18 of whom are with the Bush
campaign, Sanders said. The campaign will hit major media markets
and surrogate teams will crisscross the state to speak on behalf of
Bush.
   Sanders declined to say how much they would spend in Texas.
   While confident, state Republicans are still cautious.
   ``We're taking nothing for granted,'' said deputy campaign
director Reggie Bashur. ``We've got to run hard each and every day.
We've got to continue to beat the drum. What they do, that's their
business.''

   Disc jockey Paco Lopez has been working
at a radio station here for only four months, so he had to do a
stint on the graveyard shift.
   Now, the KICKS 106 disc jockey has agreed to be ``buried alive''
as part of a promotional gimmick.
   ``Since they won't give me a vacation, I figured the closest
thing to it was to do this,'' he said.
   He entered his plot at 7 p.m. Monday. He is scheduled to rest 2
feet underground in a specially made 3-by-6-foot coffin _ without
food, water or bathroom facilities _ until 7 p.m. Wednesday.
   ``It's nothing more than psychological,'' he said. ``It's like
lying in bed for 48 hours.''
   The coffin, buried at a car dealership, is hooked up with a
light, an air vent and a telephone over which Lopez will give live
radio reports, station promotions director Sheila Williamson said.
   The box also is equipped with a small video camera so Lopez can
be monitored continuously, she said.
   The Rev. Mike Harper, associate pastor of suburban Vestavia
Hills United Methodist Church, offered some cautionary comment
Sunday.
   ``It does seem a little tacky, although rather humorous,'' he
said. ``Needless to say, someone who recently had a death in the
family would not be overwhelmed with the appropriateness of it.''

   NEW YORK _ Yoko Ono remains ``a New Yorker at heart ... and has
not fled the city,'' but she will be dividing her time between the
Big Apple and Europe, according to her spokesman.
   Spokesman Elliot Mintz commented Monday after the New York Post
reported that Ono and her son will spend most of the next few years
in Europe partly out of fear that a recent unauthorized biography
of her slain husband, John Lennon, could set off a violent reaction.
   Mintz said Ono's remarks to the Post were taken ``out of
context.''
   ``For the record, Yoko flew to Europe to be with her son Sean on
his birthday,'' he said.
   Sean turned 13 Saturday and attends a Swiss boarding school.
   Mintz said Ono would be ``commuting back and forth'' between New
York and Europe and could spend months at a time in either place.
   Ono told the Post the biography, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by
Albert Goldman, was ``a vicious inaccurate character
assassination'' that should not be taken seriously.

   Singer Elton John urged fans at a
concert not to buy an unauthorized biography of John Lennon.
   ``This is John Lennon's birthday; think of him this evening, and
not me,'' John told the sold-out crowd at Worcester's Centrum Arena
on Sunday after he went on stage for his third encore. Sunday would
have been the slain ex-Beatle's 48th birthday.
   ``Always remember that John Lennon left us a legacy of wonderful
music ... but don't buy the book,'' John said.
   The singer was referring to Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John
Lennon,'' which characterized Lennon as an anorexic bisexual addled
by drugs.
   John sang ``Empty Garden,'' a song he and longtime colleague
Bernie Taupin wrote in honor of Lennon following his December 1980
slaying in New York. John closed the set with his version of the
Beatles' ``Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.''

   ``Bull Durham'' star Susan Sarandon has some
World Series advice for baseball fans _ ``Keep an eye on the
Oakland A's.''
   Writing in this week's TV Guide, Miss Sarandon, who plays a
baseball groupie in the hit motion picture, urges readers to root
for teams with belt loops instead of elastic waistbands and without
domed stadiums or artificial turf.
   How do the Athletics measure up?
   ``They play on grass, under the sky and have terrific belt
loops. Plus they've got a circus elephant on their sleeves,'' she
said.
   The Athletics are scheduled to square off in Game 1 of the
series at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday against the winner of the National
League playoff between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York
Mets. The Dodgers lead that best-of-seven series, three games to
two.
   Miss Sarandon says all series should go for seven games.
   ``It's a holy, magic number, a prime number, and a seventh game
assures the longest possible baseball season,'' she wrote. ``And
the shortest possible winter unless you go to Puerto Rico for
winter ball, where you can discover the next Jose Canseco while
eating fish soup in the bleachers at Santurce.''

   Two women have formed a support
group for embattled heavyweight champ Mike Tyson and are
encouraging fans to write letters of encouragement to him.
   ``I felt he needed some support and that it was important for
him to know people everywhere loved him and cared about his
situation,'' Gina Turner said Monday.
   The 29-year-old housewife has founded the Mike Tyson Support

   Turner said she got the idea after watching a recent television
interview in which Tyson's wife, Robin Givens, said the boxer was
manic-depressive and that living with him was frightening. Ms.
Givens announced last week she was seeking a divorce.
   ``On national TV he was sitting there like a little kid,'' Ms.
Turner said. ``He was very, very hurt. My heart just went out for

   Ms. Turner said 30 to 40 people have called her expressing

   Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou left a
hospital accompanied by his girlfriend and checked into a hotel to
continue his convalescence from heart surgery.
   Papandreou, 69, underwent an operation to replace a heart valve
1{ weeks ago at Harefield Hospital. The Greek Embassy said he will
spend about 10 days at the Grosvenor House Hotel before returning
to Greece.
   After Papandreou arrived in Britain last month, the Greek
government announced he would divorce Margaret Papandreou, his
American-born wife of 37 years, prompting speculation that he
planned to marry his girlfriend, Dimitre Liani.
   ``He has made a speedy recovery from his operation and has been
allowed out of hospital in a very fast time,'' Papandreou's
spokesman, Tilemacos Chytiris, said after the prime minister's
release from the hospital Monday.
   ``He must go back there twice for check-ups before he returns to
Greece,'' Chytiris said. ``He has an office in the hotel and will
be in contact with the Greek government. He can also go out for
walks.''

<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle, still trying to put his stumbling response at last week's
debate behind him, is giving what he says is his ``final word'' on
what steps he would take if thrust unexpectedly into the presidency.
   Even as he insisted to reporters Monday as he arrived in Ohio
that his campaign was ``on a roll,'' Quayle continued to face
questions on the issue as well as questions about whether he is a
drag on the GOP ticket.
   Quayle tries a new wrinkle in his campaign today with a
grass-roots approach: a day-long bus trip through small towns of
western Ohio.
   He gave his most detailed response to date when asked after a
Detroit speech how he now would answer the question put to him at
last week's debate with Lloyd Bentsen, his Democratic counterpart.
   During the debate, Quayle said he would say a prayer and summon
his advisers. The next day, Quayle revised the answer in speeches
by saying he would continue George Bush's policies.
   During a question-and-answer session Monday after an economics
speech in Detroit, Quayle called the debate question ``totally
inappropriate'' because it was ``completely hypothetical.''
   He said he would as a new president make a request to talk to
the nation, and he would consult with allies. But, he said, his
other responses would depend on the situation.
   ``Obviously you do different things under an assassination. The
first thing you do in an assassination _ I would still say a prayer
for myself and the nation _ but the first thing you do is you get
on the phone and call the head of the CIA and see what he thinks it
was. You don't convene a Cabinet meeting right away,'' Quayle said.
   ``You get your secretary of defense, your national security
adviser, your secretary of state and meet with them immediately. In
the situation of an illness it would be a different type of
situation,'' he said.
   Quayle said he would have ``contingency plans under different
situations.''
   ``And I'll tell you what: I'm not going to go out and hold a
news conference about it. I'm going to put it in a safe and keep it
there,'' he said heatedly.
   Speaking to reporters later aboard his campaign plane, Quayle
said of his latest response to the question: ``That's the final
word.''
   Quayle was also asked about polls indicating he continues to
bring negatives to the Bush-Quayle ticket.
   A Los Angeles Times poll released Monday showed the two tickets
were in a virtual dead heat _ 44 percent for the Republicans to 41
percent for the Democrats _ but Bush leads Dukakis 48-39 if the two
candidates are presented as running alone. The poll had a margin of
error of five percentage points in either direction.
   Quayle said he was ``absolutely not'' a drag on the ticket.
Crowds had responded positively to him after the debate, he said.
   ``We will continue to do what we're charged with doing and that
is going to the key states like Ohio, going to states where it's on
the margin ... and the reason I'm being sent to those places is
because I'm an asset to the ticket,'' he said.
   Quayle also defended his assertions, made during the Detroit
speech, that the Reagan-Bush administration ``kept our commitment
to the truly needy.''
   He had not mentioned in the speech that the Reagan
administration has consistently proposed cuts in programs for
education, health and the needy. Congress refused to go along with
some of the proposed cuts, resulting in the increases Quayle
praised.
   ``The fact of the matter is that what the president signed into
law and what we're spending today was up significantly in all of
those categories,'' Quayle told reporters on the plane.
   But the figures Quayle cited in his speech left room for debate.
He said, for example, that federal education spending has grown by
38 percent during the Reagan years. However, the Reagan
administration has asked for significant reductions in federal
education assistance in every year except for the current one.
   Quayle cited Pell grants for lower and moderate income students
_ an area he said had grown 64 percent during the Reagan years. But
the Reagan administration proposed a 38 percent cut in Pell grants
for fiscal 1983, 30 percent for 1986 and 30 percent for 1988, cuts
that Congress refused to go along with.
   Quayle noted that the Aid to Families with Dependent Children
program grew about 32 percent during the Reagan years. However,
fewer families are eligible for such assistance because of tighten
eligibility requirements proposed by the administration.
   The figures also do not take into account inflation, which for
the 1981-88 period was a cumulative 29.9 percent.

<HEAD>VA Official Orders New Survey After High Death Rates Found at
Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration's chief medical
officer ordered changes in a study of mortality rates at VA
hospitals to avoid ``inevitable'' criticism of the agency based on
the initial findings, according to a published report today.
   The Washington Post reported that the initial study had found
that as many as 12 percent of the VA facilities had excessively
high death rates. By using a more rigorous statistical level in the
revised study, that rate was dropped to just 3.5 percent, the
newspaper said.
   Dr. John A. Gronvall acknowledged in an interview with the Post
that he ordered VA officials to come up with a lower percentage out
of fear that the VA could not withstand criticism that
``inevitably'' would result from comparison with mortality rates at
private hospitals.
   The federal Health Care Financing Agency had found in a separate
study that 2.5 percent of the nation's private hospitals had
higher-than-expected mortality rates.
   Gronvall's action caused a strong protest from the late Dr.
Francis E. Conrad, the VA's director of quality assurance, who said
the action might seem ``self-serving'' and could make the VA
``vulnerable to charges of a coverup.''
   The Post said Conrad, in a memo prepared for a Jan. 29 meeting,
wrote that the ``PR (public relations) potential for negative
reaction is certainly a factor to be considered'' from a high
mortality rate finding, ``but it can be countered and is short
lived, in any event.''
   Gronvall, the VA's senior medical executive, told the Post there
was no truth to Conrad's belief that he was trying to cover up
problems at the VA, which long has been plagued by questions about
the quality of medical care at its 172 hospitals.
   ``That is wholly ... outrageous and inappropriate comment,''
Gronvall said of the coverup allegation.
   Before the meeting between Conrad and Gronvall, Conrad had
prepared a statistical model patterned after one used by HCFA in
its private hospital study. Like the HCFA study, the Post said,
Conrad initially planned to test his results at what statisticians
call a 95 percent confidence level. That means the mathematical
probability is that the results can be duplicated 95 times out of
100.
   The VA, however, selected a higher confidence level of 99
percent, thus assuring that fewer hospitals would be suspect, the
Post said.
   The decision to use the 99 percent result was made after
Gronvall's intervention, according to what the Post described as a
source close to the situation. The newspaper did not name the
source.
   Terry L. Thomas, the VA epidemiologist who handled the
statistical work on the study, told the Post she could not recall
if she made the decision to run the mortality survey at the 99
percent rate before or after Gronvall voiced concern about the
preliminary findings.
   Thomas said she ``wasn't too happy with'' the study.
   Conrad told Gronvall the 99 percent level would allow some VA
hospitals with potentially serious mortality rates to escape
scrutiny.
   Gronvall said he feared the comparisons with the HCFA study
would be ``inappropriate and invidious,'' upsetting the VA's
critics in Congress and elsewhere and leading to a widespread
impression that VA's medical care is much worse than that in
private hospitals.
   Using the 99 percent confidence level, the study came up with
six problem hospitals, or 3.5 percent of the 172, according to
Donna St. John, a VA spokeswoman. She and Thomas said they were
unfamiliar with the 12.8 percent figures mentioned by Conrad in his
briefing papers.
   Gronvall declined to name the six hospitals, citing a decision
by VA Administrator Thomas K. Turnage to withhold the data until
after follow-up studies are completed, probably in late December.

<HEAD>Official: Rocky Flats Incident Shuts Down Plutonium Processing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Nuclear Security, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shutdown of Rocky Flats' main plutonium
processing plant virtually halts production at the nuclear weapons
plant and is the nation's second major suspension of such
production in two months, an official said.
   The building was shut down Saturday because of a ``minor safety
incident,'' according to the U.S. Energy Department. Three people
were tested for ``potential health effects'' stemming from last
month's incident, officials said.
   Rockwell International Corp., which runs the plant, said no
radioactive material was released nor was there any threat to the
public or the environment.
   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz said Monday that the shutdown would
not affect other areas of the plant, and the building's 575
employees would not be laid off during the shutdown. The plant
employs about 5,000.
   But Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's top safety
expert, told The New York Times that the shutdown was in a building
where classified work vital to the entire plant's operation is
performed.
   The shutdown essentially halts all production at the plant, he
said, according to today's editions of the newspaper.
   All three reactors at another nuclear weapons plant, the
Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., have been shut down since
August when a mishap idled one of the reactors. The plant makes
plutonium and tritium, which are used in nuclear weapons.
   There are 13 other major production, waste and research plants
in 12 states involved in nuclear weapons production.
   The Rocky Flats incident occurred Sept. 29 in Building 771 at
the plant 15 miles northwest of Denver. Heintz, who didn't
elaborate on the incident, said it would be up to the Energy
Department to decide to reopen the building, and a restart team
already had been set up.
   Speaking in Washington, Starostecki said the order came about
after an Energy Department inspector and two Rockwell employees
were contaminated by plutonium when they walked into an unmarked
room where maintenance and cleanup work was being performed on
plutonium-contaminated equipment.
   Rockwell will conduct a semiannual inventory of nuclear
materials in the building during the shutdown, the Energy
Department said.
   It said Rockwell curtailed maintenance and construction in the
building Oct. 4 to review the situation. The review determined
among other things that airborne radioactive contamination levels
were within government guidelines, but higher than Department of
Energy goals.
   Early this year, an Energy Department team reported ``serious
concerns'' with radiation monitoring practices at the plant. The
team spent a week auditing the plant and plutonium processing,
paying what it termed close attention to the calibration of plant
radiation measurement equipment.
   At the Savannah River Plant, it was disclosed last week that up
to 30 significant mishaps occurred during the past three decades,
and that many had not been reported to Washington or disclosed to
the public.

   The dollar plunged Tuesday against the Japanese
yen, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 85.93-point
winner Friday, closed at 27,469.60, gaining another 211.33 points
or 0.78 percent.
   The dollar finished trading at 131.15 yen, down 2.35 yen from
Friday's close of 133.50 yen. After opening at 132.20 yen, the
currency moved between 130.95 yen and 132.23 yen.
   Japan's stock and foreign exchange markets were closed Monday
for a national holiday.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's slide below the 132-yen mark to
technical selling, because there was no fresh market-affecting news
to induce dollar-selling.
   ``The dollar in Tokyo fell following its plunge in London,''
said Takamasa Yamasaki with Daiwa Bank.
   The dollar declined Monday in London after a statement by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who said the British
government would keep interest rates high ``as long as it is
necessary to fight inflation,'' market participants said.
   Lawson also said in a television interview he would push
interest rates higher if sterling falls. Higher British interest
rates would increase the investment attractiveness of the British
currency, possibly at the expense of the dollar.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously, said the
dollar remained weak but added a slide below 131.50 yen was
unlikely.
   On the stock exchange, ``share prices were higher almost across
the board,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``The index rose sharply following the Dow Jones' higher close
in New York (overnight),'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   But trading was light because some participants were cautious
ahead of the report of U.S. trade figures for August, due out
Thursday in Washington, the analyst said.

   A Nova Scotia gourd grower pounded the
competition with a super-heavyweight pumpkin that tipped the scales
at a near-record 633{ pounds _ an international victory he says
came without steroids.
   Keith Chapel, 56, gleefully denied a mischievous suggestion that
he may have used anabolic steroids on his entry to win Monday's
International Pumpkin Association World Weigh-Off.
   ``Oh, no!'' said Chapel, responding to the allegation.
   The question came in light of drug scandals that plagued the
Summer Olympics at Seoul, including the case of Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his gold medal when officials
found he'd used the banned drug that bolsters muscle building but
has many harmful side effects.
   Chapel, a schoolteacher when he's not growing pumpkins, spoke
over a loudspeaker during an international conference call from
Canada heard on the steps of San Francisco City Hall.
   His entry, which competed with plump pumpkins from the United
States, England and Japan, won him $2,000 and a trip to San
Francisco.
   England's 317-pound entry, grown by Ron Butcher, was weighed in
a pub, where cries of encouragement echoed across the City Hall
steps some 5,000 miles away.
   But Japan's Shoji Sjirai wasn't so lucky. His 513-pound pumpkin
broke into pieces on its way to the scale. The international
contest accepted the 313-pound entry from Hiroshi Sawa, instead.
   Chapel's wife, Ruth, also entered the contest. But Chapel said
he didn't think she was ``cruelly disappointed'' at placing behind
her husband.
   ``Hers was a squash,'' Chapel diplomatically noted, saying that
pumpkins are in their own class _ ``fruits with trailing vines.''
   Contest spokeswoman Terry Pimsleur said the other winners would
receive prizes including ribbons and will be invited to the Great
Halloween & Pumpkin Festival here later this month.
   A Canadian also won last year's International Pumpkin
Association World Weigh-Off. Arthur Bessey of York, Prince Edward
Island, weighed in with a winning 408-pound pumpkin.
   The largest pumpkin ever grown, according to the 1988 Guinness
Book of World Records, was a 671-pound gourd raised by Robert
Gancarz of Jacobstown, N.J., in October 1986. It measured 11 feet,
11\ inches in circumference.

<HEAD>Utah Governor Underdog In Bid For Second Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hobbled by an independent challenge that
has siphoned off some of his conservative support, Republican Gov.
Norm Bangerter is a distinct underdog in his bid for a second term.
   Democrat Ted Wilson holds a double-digit lead in the polls, and
independent Merrill Cook commands the loyality of Republicans who
blame the governor for the biggest tax increase in Utah history.
   However, Bangerter and his supporters contend there is time
before November's election to reclaim the support that swept him
into office four years ago as Utah's first Republican governor in
two decades.
   ``The polls are tightening and I think Norm could pull this
out,'' Charles Akerlow, former state GOP chairman, said recently.
``He's running hard and running scared and, consequently, running
very well.''
   ``We think we can win it with a good turnout and a good showing
by (Vice President George) Bush and (Republican Sen. Orrin)
Hatch,'' said campaign manager Dave Buhler.
   Bangerter's biggest problem has not been Wilson, former mayor of
Salt Lake City, but his own record.
   Elected in 1984 with 56 percent of the vote, Bangerter saw his
popularity plummet two years later after he cajoled a bipartisan
majority in the Legislature into passing a record $166 million tax
increase.
   He also has been sharply criticized for a $60 million pumping
project _ launched just as the state entered a long dry spell _ to
control flooding on the Great Salt Lake, and for the slow recovery
of Utah's lackluster economy.
   The higher taxes spawned a movement that drafted Cook, owner of
a mining explosives company, to carry its tax-limitation message to
voters.
   Despite an $80 million refund and tax cut approved by the
Legislature in August, support for Cook has grown from around 9
percent last spring to 16 percent in a Sept. 25 survey published by
The Salt Lake Tribune.
   The survey of 600 voters gave Wilson a 49-29 lead over Bangerter
with 5 percent undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   Bangerter said Cook's support among Republicans and conservative
independents has made it difficult for him to highlight his
differences with Wilson.
   Cook's supporters ``are conservative voters and conservative
voters generally vote for Republicans. I think it's been proven I'm
much more conservative fiscally and in every other way than Ted
Wilson, and so it skews that,'' Bangerter said.
   Bangerter also has been hurt by three tax-limitation
initiatives, endorsed by Cook, that will be on the ballot.
Bangerter and Wilson oppose the measures, which would reduce state
and local government revenue by about $300 million or more.
   ``They sort of remind everybody that it was Norm who raised
taxes in the first place,'' said Akerlow.
   Akerlow said that Bangerter also might actually benefit from
Cook's candidacy if Cook continues to pull support from Wilson and
splits the vote enough for Bangerter to win without a majority.

<TEXT>
   Striking workers at International Paper Co.
mills in three states concede they lost their sometimes violent
16-month battle with the company but vow to continue pressing for
better working conditions.
   The United Paperworkers International Union abruptly announced
an end to strikes at International Paper mills in Maine, Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania, saying the move would give the 2,300 strikers the
first shot at any jobs vacated by the non-union workers running the
mills.
   ``This stage of the war is over,'' said Felix Jacques, executive
vice president of Local 14. ``We have lost this battle but the war
for justice in the workplace is not over.''
   The workers, including 1,200 at the Jay plant, went on strike
June 16, 1987, when the union rejected a concessionary contract.
The company imposed the contract and kept the plants open with
replacement workers.
   The key unresolved issues included the company's demand to end
double time for employees who worked Sundays and holidays, and to
eliminate more than 175 jobs by changing work rules.
   William Meserve, the local's president, said the strikes were
halted because the company was willing to spend ``hundreds of
millions of dollars to try to break the unions or make them
ineffective.''
   Jacques said the national union could not provide the support
needed to continue the strike much longer. The $55 weekly payments
to the strikers were scheduled to be suspended in six weeks, he
said.
   ``It's not that we don't want to fight _ it's just that we
can't,'' said striker Roland Samson. ``We have nothing to fight
with.''
   Jacques notified his grim-faced members at a news conference
Monday, one day after presidents of UPIU locals at the three mills
had reached their decision at union headquarters in Nashville,
Tenn. The 1,200 union members in Jay comprised the largest group of
strikers.
   A mill spokesman here acknowledged that by calling off the
strike, the union members gained the right to be given preference
for any openings. But he said the mill was ``at full complement''
and hires new employees at an average of only three per week.
   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been on
strike who qualify for those openings,'' said the spokesman,
Richard White. He emphasized that no replacements would be asked to
leave.
   International Paper, one of the world's largest paper companies,
has said the strike had little effect on production. Shareholders'
net earnings during the first half of 1988 were $347 million,
compared with $180 million for the period last year, White said.
Net sales rose from $3.7 billion for the period last year to $4.7
billion this year.
   Strikes also were halted at International Paper mills in De
Pere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa. The action had no direct impact on
the Mobile, Ala., mill, where the company has locked out more than
1,000 union members.
   The union had sought to consolidate the disputes at the four
mills, but with little success.
   During the strike, this mill in this central Maine town of 4,000
had been the scene of boisterous rallies, marches, and occasional
violence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activities
on the picket line.
   A series of chemical leaks and accidents at the mill heightened
tensions in recent months, with the union blaming the problems on
the new workers' inexperience.

<HEAD>Six Injured In Bomb Explosions In Colombo</HEAD>

   Three bombs exploded in the capital
and injured at least six people today, a day after five people died
during a nationwide strike to protest the government's peace
overtures to Tamil rebels.
   Authorities believe the bombs were planted by the People's
Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group that called Monday's
strike, said A.S. Seneviratne, deputy inspector-general of police.
   ``Troops and police cordoned off the area of the blasts and
conducted search operations,'' Seneviratne said. ``A number of
suspects have been taken in for questioning.''
   Two bombs exploded in the business center of Colombo, while a
third went off near a supermarket in a suburb of the city, he said.
   The People's Liberation Front says a peace accord aimed at
ending the 5-year-old civil war grants too many concessions to the
Tamils, who are fighting for an independent homeland in the
northeastern province.
   The group has vowed to kill all supporters of the accord and is
blamed for at least 500 deaths since the agreement was signed on
July 29, 1987.
   Tamil insurgents have been fighting for a separate state since
1983, claiming they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese. At least 8,500 people have been killed in the fighting.
   Two bombs had exploded in Colombo on Monday during the strike,
injuring four people, including two soldiers.
   Five people died and four others were injured Monday when police
opened fire on a group of Sinhalese demonstrators who attacked a
police station in the town of Matara, about 85 miles south of
Colombo.
   Meanwhile, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and
most militant rebel group, said it was not responsible for the
killing Sunday of 47 Sinhalese villagers in a northern village.
   ``The aim of this malicious report is to discredit our
organization,'' said a statement from the Tigers' office in London.
   The victims, including 13 women and 18 children, were killed
while they slept in the village of Ulukulama, 150 miles northeast
of Colombo. One military official, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, had said the massacre was ``clearly the work of the
Tigers.''
   The killings were the worst burst of violence in the
ethnically-divided island for the past year and came a day before
nominations to a local administrative council in the
Tamil-dominated northeastern province closed.
   The council is a key part of the India-brokered peace accord
under which the Tamils agreed to give up arms in exchange for
limited autonomy. The Tigers accepted but later rejected the
agreement, saying it did not meet enough demands.
   India sponsored the accord because 60 million Tamils living in
southern India are sympathetic to the rebel cause. It sent an
estimated 47,000 peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka on Oct. 10, 1987,
to implement the plan after the Tigers reneged.
   Other rebel groups which accepted the accord have filed
nominations to the administrative council despite a call by the
Tigers for a boycott.
   Election Commissioner Chandrananda De Silva said today that
members of the moderate Tamil groups already had been elected to 36
of the 71 seats because they were uncontested. Polls are scheduled
to be held on Nov. 19 for the other 35 seats, which are being
contested by Tamil groups, the governing United National Party and
the opposition Sri Lanka Moslem Congress, he said.
   Tamils, who are mainly Hindus, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. The mostly Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent of
the population and control the country's government and military.

<TEXT>
   The Brazilian red-eyed fly, which has a
fatal attraction to the pesky and destructive mole cricket, is
successfully breeding in Florida, scientists say.
   Red-eyed flies, introduced in April to help control the
crickets, have been found in traps set for them around Bradenton,
south of Tampa, an entomologist at the University of Florida said
Monday.
   ``We were a little worried until we finally found several
pregnant flies in our traps in late August,'' said Tom Walker.
``But now it looks like we've established a new enemy of the mole
cricket.''
   Mole crickets do at least $46 million worth of damage every year
to Florida vegetable fields, commercial turf operations, pastures
and golf courses, according to university scientists.
   ``We're working toward reducing the mole cricket population to a
point where it is no longer damaging,'' said Howard Frank, project
coordinator at university's Institute of Food and Agriculture
Sciences.
   ``We can't tell any difference yet in mole cricket populations.
We'll have to measure changes over several years to quantify the
effects,'' Frank said.
   The red-eyed Brazilian fly is about the size of a house fly.
Females respond to the male mole cricket's mating call and lay
larvae on or near the male mole cricket.
   The larvae burrow into the male mole cricket. They come out
about 10 days later after killing it.
   Now that the flies are breeding, the control project's next
obstacle is winter. Mole crickets are less active then and
scientists are unsure whether the flies will survive the winter.
   Walker is optimistic.
   ``We're 90 percent sure we'll have flies next spring,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   When Richard Wagner put him on the operatic stage
in 1845, Tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many
_ the pagan goddess of love. Now, he's a television evangelist with
the same problem.
   The goddess in Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhauser,''
which premiered Monday evening at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, lives
in a sleazy Las Vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing only
their bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of Act 1.
   Tannhauser himself, sung by tenor Richard Cassilly, bears a
certain resemblance to the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.
   Tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremony
at a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the Rev. Robert
Schuller's headquarters in California. In February, Swaggart
confessed to committing unspecified sins against his family and
God, while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude in
a motel room.
   In the play, Tannhauser achieves salvation by a miracle
performed at Los Angeles International Airport.
   ``There will be a bunch of things on stage that people will
react to involuntarily,'' Sellars, 33, predicted in an interview
printed in the program. ``I love making something just familiar
enough and at the same time just strange enough that you feel at
home enough to be caught off guard _ and to react without any
preconceived ideas.''
   Despite angry letters to newspapers in weeks preceding the
premiere denouncing Sellars' modernization as ``anti-Wagnerian''
and ``anti-Christian,'' no protesters picketed outside the opera
house.
   Audience members noted that the histrionic gestures and language
often used by television evangelists fit well with the high-flown
Wagnerian emotionalism of the libretto.
   Sellars' translation of the libretto into ``modern American''
evoked laughs during Tannhauser's Act 1 love scene with the goddess
Venus.
   Titles projected above the stage had Venus, sung by Marilyn
Zschau, describing ``bodacious wonder'' and ``singing the blues,''
and expressing such thoughts as ``Sing it baby, grab that harp!''
   Act 2, however, was played seriously. As in Wagner's original,
Tannhauser and other claimants compete in a contest of holy song
for the hand of the virtuous heroine, Elisabeth, portrayed by
Nadine Secunde.
   Tannhauser, unfortunately, begins singing of the carnal love he
enjoyed with Venus and is condemned as a sinner.
   Some audience members said they found the televangelism analogy
a good one.
   ``There's nothing in the modern age that fits an overblown
character like Tannhauser,'' said Matthew Vender Venn. ``It's got
to be a televangelist, or maybe Ollie North, if you really wanted
to be silly.''
   Others were a bit mixed in their reaction to the work by
Sellars, an avant garde impressario whose operatic triumphs
included last year's ``Nixon in China.''
   ``Peter Sellars is always an experience,'' said Dwight Casimere.
``You know a given opera and you know where Sellars is coming from
_ he tries to get a visceral reaction _ and you try to figure out
how it's going to fit together. To me, there are always
discrepancies. There are discrepancies tonight, but the music is
great and the singing is great.''
   Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, in Baton Rouge, La., had no comment
on the performance.
   ``I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about,''
ministries spokeswoman Linda Westbrook said Monday.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Take Another Provincial Capital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The capital of Afghanistan's
northeastern Kunar province has fallen to Moslem guerrillas,
bringing to four the provincial capitals now being held by the
Afghan resistance, a guerrilla spokesman said.
   Asim Nasser-Zia, a member of one of the moderate guerrilla
organizations, said news of Asadabad's fall reached the Pakistan
capital early today.
   The city had been under heavy seige for much of the past month.
Details of the capture were sketchy, he said.
   Fazle Akbar, a spokesman with the Afghan Information and
Documentation Center in Pakistan's northwest frontier city of
Peshawar, said government troops had begun evacuating Asadabad last
week.
   Asadabad's fall gives Afghan rebels full control of Kunar
province which borders Pakistan and is a strategic link to
Afghanistan's north.
   It also opens a northern route to the Afghan capital city of
Kabul and gives guerrillas access to the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Asadabad sits about 12 miles from the Pakistan border and 100
miles northeast of Kabul.
   Mohammad Ishaq, a member of the Hezb-E-Islami group, said
Asadabad had been captured and added that rebels also overran a
number of other government garrisons.
   Ishaq said Pashad, a garrison town, also fell during the
fighting.
   Before Asadabad's capture, rebel forces claimed they controlled
Sharan, the provincial capital of southeastern Paktika, Toloqan,
the capital of northeastern Takhar province and the central Bamyan
provincial centre.
   In the past two weeks guerrillas have chalked up several
victories, including Sharan and Asadabad. The majority have been in
the eastern half of the country, along the border with Pakistan.
   U.S.-backed insurgents have been waging a 10-year war with the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul. Red Army troops that marched
into Afghanistan in December 1979 are on their way home after the
signing of a U.N.-brokered accord in Geneva.
   Half of an estimated 100,300 Soviet soldiers remain in
Afghanistan. They are to be out by Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. election has stalled progress
on the Central American peace plan and parties to the agreement are
running out of time to fulfill the pact, Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias Sanchez said.
   Arias, here to announce the creation of a private peace
foundation financed with the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize he won for
sponsoring the peace plan, was careful to avoid blaming either U.S.
presidential candidate. He said Monday he believes either would
bring more understanding to the region.
   He urged the next U.S. president to support the plan and warned
against seeking military solutions in Central America.
   ``Whoever is elected to the White House, if they support the
peace plan, this plan is incompatible with warlike action,'' Arias
said.
   The five Central American presidents who signed the original
peace agreement are tentatively scheduled to meet again after the
U.S. elections, possibly Nov. 12-15 in El Salvador, to give the
plan a push, Arias said.
   ``Almost 14 months have gone by and we cannot feel satisfied _
there has not been the will to fulfill the agreement,'' Arias said.
``We are running out of time.''
   He did emphasize that the plan has accomplished a truce in
Nicaragua and started a dialogue among the participants, though.
   Arias blamed Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas for being
inflexible on choosing a site for future negotiations with Contra
rebels and for hiding behind judicial technicalities in failing to
release 38 opposition leaders arrested in violation of the plan
during an anti-government demonstration.
   The Costa Rican president again rejected calls by the
Sandinistas and the Contras to put an international peace-keeping
force on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua, and perhaps
elsewhere, to separate the feuding sides.
   ``I do not believe it is necessary to introduce third
countries,'' Arias said. ``The greatness of the agreement is that
it is a Central American plan.''
   Arias also said he would welcome efforts by Fidel Castro to
achieve peace in Central America, noting the Cuban president has a
``very strong moral commitment'' to leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador and Guatemala and the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   The Costa Rican president stopped in Coral Gables on his way to
Spain to receive the Prince de Asturias Award, that nation's
highest honor, from King Juan Carlos. He was expected to stay at
least one day in the Miami area before flying to Spain.
   With his wife Margarita Penon de Arias at his side, he also
announced the creation of The Arias Foundation for Peace and Human
Progress. Arias said the $400,000 he received for the Nobel Prize
will be the seed money for the organization.
   Mrs. Arias, who will head the foundation, said it was aimed
particularly at saving families victimized by war and poverty in
Central America.
   The foundation will support research, design projects to benefit
children and families, provide scholarships and organize
international conferences.

   Authorities said they would ease a curfew today in
a southern enclave to help workers return to their jobs, but they
acknowledged that nearly yearlong strikes over Armenian demands
have ruined the region's economy.
   Production of goods and services in the enclave,
Nagorno-Karabakh, and the surrounding republic of Azerbaijan has
dropped below 1970 levels, the Communist Party daily Pravda said
Monday.
   The Armenian Christian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh wants the
area transferred from the jurisdiction of the republic of
Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Moslem, to neighboring Armenia.
   The news agency Tass said Monday that party and state
representatives, using personal persuasion, succeeded in drawing
workers back to 80 percent of the construction collectives in
Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Tass also said authorities would ease a curfew imposed Sept. 21
on Stepanakert, where troops and tanks were sent to quell ethnic
violence. To allow late shift workers to travel, the curfew in
Stepanakert will run from midnight to 5 a.m. rather than 9 p.m.-6
a.m., starting today.
   Soviet television on Monday night offered an upbeat report on
conditions in Armenia, showing smiling grape pickers and saying
that all 227 businesses in the capital, Yerevan, were operating.
   The Pravda article blamed the unrest on years of corruption and
economic problems.
   In a startling aside, however, it quoted the former Communist
Party chief in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, as blaming ethnic rioting that
killed 32 people in that industrial city in February on ex-convicts
and local wrath over air pollution. The official, D. Muslim-Zadye,
said the former convicts were sent to the area after their release
from prison.
   ``Speaking honestly, I expected an explosion,'' he said. ``It
had been ripening for a long time and just needed a spark. It found
one in the events in Nagorno-Karabakh.''

<HEAD>FAA Study Suggests Steps to Improve Operations at Busiest U.S.
Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have proposed 80 steps to
improve operations at the nation's busiest airport, including
incentives to attract experienced air-traffic controllers,
according to a report published today.
   The recommendations for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport
came in a Federal Aviation Administration study that has not yet
been officially released, The New York Times said.
   The study preceded last week's FAA move to restrict O'Hare
flights during peak traffic hours in response to recent controller
errors, the Times said.
   The study proposed higher pay and other incentives for
controllers, and recommended lightening controllers' workloads by
alleviating radio congestion and easing restrictions on the use of
intersecting runways when they are wet from rain, said the Times.
   Today's turbojet aircraft are capable of operating safely on
such runways in the right conditions, the report said.
   It further suggested locating de-icing stations near where
planes take off to ease congestion caused when aircraft must return
to boarding gates for a second de-icing after waiting too long in
the snow.
   The proposals would need approval at higher levels of the Reagan
administration before they could be enacted, and some would require
congressional legislation.
   There have been 30 controller flight-handling errors so far this
year in the Chicago area, which includes O'Hare and numerous
satellite airfields, compared to 12 during all of last year,
officials said.
   The FAA study was ordered Aug. 8, the day the National
Transportation Safety Board sent the agency 11 recommendations for
safer handling of flights in the Chicago area.
   That list also included incentives to attract top controllers
and suggested using simulators in their training. The board's
recommendations were prompted by earlier controller errors.

<TEXT>
   Troops arrested four alleged
right-wing extremists during a series of raids ending early today,
and the military said the suspects were linked to an attack on a
military armory last June.
   In another development, the armed forces announced that
Communist rebels raided a police station in Davao del Norte
province Monday and kidnapped four policemen.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy commander of the Manila district,
said the four rightists were arrested separately between Saturday
and Monday night.
   A fifth alleged extremist escaped from a window as troops burst
into his home in suburban Caloocan City early today, Oxales said.
   Heavily armed troops in full battle gear also surrounded a hotel
near military headquarters before dawn Tuesday. But Oxales denied
published reports that the troops were looking for former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, renegade leader of the bloody Aug. 28,
1987, bid to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   Oxales said the four face charges of conspiracy to commit
rebellion, robbery and sedition in connection with the June 11 raid
on the armory at Camp Crame, headquarters of the Philippine
Constabulary.
   The military said the raid was staged to free a former
provincial governor, Orlando Dulay, who is charged with murder in
the deaths of several campaign workers employed by Mrs. Aquino when
she ran for president against Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
   The raiders failed to release Dulay but made off with 24 M-16
rifles, the military said.
   The four were presented to reporters at a press conference,
where one of them, Hai Buivanvan, admitted he was part of the
raiding force. Another suspect, Robert Taguda, said he joined the
rightist force because he was told it was an ``anti-Communist
group.''
   The latest arrests brought to nearly 80 the number of alleged
rightists whom the military claims to have apprehended in recent
weeks.
   Shortly before midnight Monday, soldiers set up roadblocks on
streets leading to the Camelot Hotel, and about an hour later,
armed troops wearing gas masks were seen entering the building in
suburban Quezon City.
   Officers refused to give any reason for the move nor would they
speak with reporters. The soldiers left about 1:30 a.m. without
explanation and without apparently having made any arrest.
   Peoples Journal Tonight and The Evening Star said the raiders
were looking for Honasan. The charismatic former colonel was
arrested last December but escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay
the following April.
   Oxales said the raiders were looking for ``rightists elements''
reportedly seen at the hotel but none were found. Asked if the
``elements'' included Honasan, Oxales replied: ``Actually, we were
not looking for him there.''
   Mutineers occupied the Camelot Hotel and nearby Camp Aguinaldo,
headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, during the
failed coup. They were driven off by loyal forces after at least 53
people were killed and more than 300 were wounded.
   Monday's raid by Communist rebels took place in Santo Tomas, a
town of about 44,000 people located about 590 miles south of Manila
on Mindanao island.
   The report said four high school students were also injured
during the raid. It said the rebels fled with weapons, two
typewriters and the kidnapped policemen.
   The rebel New People's Army has been waging a 19-year insurgency
to establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.

   Hank Williams Jr., the son of a music
legend, and K.T. Oslin, who launched a career at age 44 and still
does the chores at home, each won two Country Music Association
awards.
   Williams was voted entertainer of the year for the second
straight year, joining Barbara Mandrelland the group Alabama as the
only performers to have won it more than once. His ``Born to
Boogie'' won top album in Monday night's presentations broadcast
nationally by CBS-TV.
   Oslin was voted the year's top female vocalist and won best song
for her poignant ``80's Ladies.'' The awards came just two years
after she began singing country music professionally following
minor singing roles on Broadway and making television commercials
for items like denture products.
   Randy Travis, whose album ``Always & Forever'' has sold 3
million copies, won No. 1 male vocalist for the second straight
year at the black-tie ceremonies at the Grand Ole Opry House.
   Williams, 39, whose father, Hank Williams Sr., sang country
weepers like ``Your Cheatin' Heart'' in the early 1950s, said he
performed more than two decades before he began winning awards
three years ago for his rousing blend of country, rock 'n' roll and
blues.
   ``The longer the wait, the sweeter the sugar,'' Williams said
after Monday night's 22nd annual presentations.
   ``I love to entertain. When I'm on that stage I'm right at home.
It's a family tradition, you know.''
   Oslin, 46, ended a four-year reign by Reba McEntire by winning
the bullet-shaped trophy as the top female vocalist. She has become
known for writing well-crafted songs from the viewpoint of a
middle-aged woman and said her life is middle-class.
   ``I'm still going to the grocery store and picking up laundry
and sweeping and raking and doing all that,'' she said.
   ``I watched this show (on television) for two years; one year I
watched it crying, and another year I couldn't watch it at all,''
Oslin said about past career disappointments.
   McEntire, a former rodeo barrel racer, won nothing this year
though she has five previous CMA awards to her credit, including
entertainer of the year in 1986.
   The single of the year was ``18 Wheels & a Dozen Roses,'' by
Kathy Mattea, a former tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Other winners included the mother-daughter Judds, vocal duo of
the year; veterans Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton,
top vocal event; Highway 101, group of the year; Ricky Van Shelton,
Horizon Award for a rising performer, and guitarist Chet Atkins,
musician of the year for the ninth time in his long career.
   Loretta Lynn, whose life was the subject of the 1980 movie
``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' and cowboy singer Roy Rogers became the
47th and 48th members of the Country Music Hall of Fame.

   Premier Ciriaco De Mita has staked the future of his
6-month-old government on the outcome of a proposal to abolish most
secret voting in the legislature.
   But a vote on that proposal, scheduled for today, is itself
secret, opening the way for so-called secret ``snipers'' to go into
action.
   ``Snipers'' are lawmakers who vote against their own party. The
practice erodes party solidarity and has weakened many of Italy's
48 postwar governments.
   However, supporters of closed voting contend that because of the
tight discipline demanded by most parties, a lawmaker can only
maintain independence in secret.
   Closed voting can allow the Communists, Italy's second largest
party after de Mita's Christian Democrats, to muster a majority.
Indeed, Communists initially backed a proposal to make voting
public only on financial questions.
   On Friday, in the Chamber of Deputies, Parliament's lower house,
snipers were in fine form as the government won narrowly won votes
to include certain elements in its proposal. Their vote on the
overall package is scheduled for today, and the Italian Senate will
consider its own version of the proposal separately.
   De Mita, a Christian Democrat, formed his coalition government
in April, establishing the curtailment of secret voting as a key
platform plank. The other coalition members are the Socialists,
Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats.
   The Socialists, who rank as the coalition's No. 2 member, have
pushed hard for the reform.
   On Saturday, De Mita referred to the snipers when addressing a
gathering of young Christian Democrats in the southern province of
Lecce.
   ``If the majority is no longer there, I'll have to take note of
it,'' he said. Journalists and other politicians took the remark to
mean he would resign if the reform measure fails.
   Snipers could be critical in the vote. Of the 630 deputies in
the chamber, 377 belong to coalition parties, normally giving the
government a comfortable margin, since 316 votes would be needed
for passage.
   However, on Friday, defecting deputies from coalition parties
joined with opposition Communists to water down the proposal by
adding exceptions which allow secret voting.
   After Friday's voting, the proposed exceptions included voting
on chamber rules, substantive constitutional changes, and special
investigative bodies, such as a national anti-Mafia commission.
   The government originally wanted the only exceptions to be
voting on fundamental liberties and issues of conscience, such as
abortion and genetic experimentation.

   Federal undercover agents lured nine people
to a fake wedding and then arrested them in connection with an
international money-laundering scheme, a newspaper reported today.
   The U.S. Attorney's office has scheduled a news conference today
to discuss the case and announce the indictments handed up earlier
this month, according to unidentified sources cited by The Tampa
Tribune.
   Top drug enforcement officials from Britain and France have
investigated the case, a reputed $40 million money-laundering
operation, in cooperation with U.S. agents, the newspaper said.
   The nine people arrested Sunday were invited to the wedding by a
U.S. Customs agent playing the role of a drug financier seeking
advice on money laundering, the newspaper said
   ``It was a Cecil B. DeMille production,'' the unidentified
federal official said of the fictitious wedding.
   Five of the nine are past or present employees of the
multi-national Bank of Credit and Commerce International, said bank
attorney Marty Steinberg in Miami.
   ``We haven't been provided with any specific allegations. We're
anxiously waiting to see what the charges are,'' said Steinberg.
   Iqbal Ashraf, a Pakistani-born British citizen, opened the Tampa
branch of the bank in late 1984.
   The bank's major business was providing letters of credit and
helping finance international business deals, he said.
   Ashraf said the bank was founded in the early 1970s and is owned
by a holding company in Luxembourg.
   Federal officials declined to comment on the case Monday.
   The nine people arrested Sunday were being held in the
Hillsborough County Jail without bail.

<HEAD>U.S.-Canada Agreement Clears Way for Icebreaker to Use Northwest
Passage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Canadian agreement has cleared the
way for the Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star to head east through
the Northwest Passage since ice blocked the vessel's usual westward
route.
   A State Department official confirmed the agreement Monday but
refused to be identified because the deal had not been formally
announced.
   ``We requested consent to transit the Northwest Passage, and the
Canadians gave it,'' the diplomat said.
   Canada claims the Northwest Passage as territorial waters, while
the United States asserts an international right of passage through
waterways between the polar icecap and Canada's Yukon and Northwest
Territories.
   With offices of both government closed Monday because of
Columbus Day in the United States and Thanksgiving in Canada, John
Fieldhouse of the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., said from
his home that the Polar Star would be allowed to pass through the
disputed waters.
   ``They're on their way,'' Fieldhouse said.
   The 399-foot ship was unsuccessful last weekend in attempts to
break through the ice-clogged Beaufort Sea west of Prudhoe Bay in
northern Alaska, said Coast Guard Lt. Geoff Merrell in Juneau.
   ``It is what they call multiyear ice ... the icing conditions
were quite heavy,'' Merrell said.
   The Polar Star, which had been on a support mission for arctic
scientists, returned to Prudhoe Bay for restocking while officials
decided the next course of action.
   Last week, the Canadian government granted a U.S. request to let
the Polar Star enter arctic waters claimed by Canada to refuel and
repair a turbine, said Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark.
   The request marked the first test of the Canada-U.S. Arctic
Cooperation Agreement that was signed in January. Under the pact,
the United States agreed to seek Canadian permission before surface
ships enter Canadian waters.
   Canada protested when the Polar Star's twin icebreaker, Polar
Sea, traveled through the Northwest Passage in 1985.
   Had Canada denied permission for the Polar Star, the ship would
have spent the winter at Prudhoe Bay with a skeleton crew, said
Coast Guard Lt. Pete Marsh in Seattle.

   A group led by State Department official who is a
former aide to Nancy Reagan plans to use U.S. civilian pilots to
fly armed missions against foreign narcotics traffickers, according
to reports published today.
   Under the first missions organized by the Inter-regional
Narcotics Eradication Air Wing, civilian-piloted gunships will join
Peruvian narcotics police in raids to destroy cocaine laboratories,
warehouses and airstrips, Knight-Ridder newspapers including The
Miami Herald reported from Washington. The Peruvians will operate
the M-60 machine guns and fire on drug dealers in any
confrontations, according to State Department planning documents
cited in the report.
   On future missions planned in Asia, Latin America and the
Caribbean, foreign personnel will also man the weapons.
   ``We don't kill people, we (will) just fly the choppers that
kill people,'' said one unidentified U.S. citizen who has
participated in anti-drug efforts.
   The coordinator of the effort, Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant
secretary of state for International Narcotics Matters, said she
plans to use the nearly 150 planes and helicopters to ``build up a
paramilitary capability'' against Latin American traffickers first.
   Wrobleski isa former congressional press aide and a former aide
to the first lady.
   Plans this week to begin use of the herbicide tebuthiuron, or
Spike, on coca plants in Peru were stalled due to environmental
concerns. In addition, the House Foreign Relations Committee has
blocked an estimated $10 million plan by Wrobleski to rebuild 20
Army surplus Hughes UN-1H helicopters for strikes against growers
and traffickers in Peru and Bolivia.
   Still, Wrobleski said the program is moving forward.
   Last month, 450 paratroopers of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne
Division staged a simulated rescue of 17 Americans held hostage by
drug traffickers.
   Armed air wing crews are taking local workers to coca fields,
where they pull up the plants.
   Following operations in South America, the air wing is expected
to expand to Central America and Caribbean islands, such as
Jamaica, the report said.
   The State Depatment began its international anti-drug campaigns
in 1978 when Congress offered Mexico four helicopters to spray
marijuana and opium poppies with the herbicide paraquat.
   The State Department now maintains about 120 aircraft involved
in drug efforts in Mexico, Colombia and Burma.

   A cold front spread showers and thunderstorms across the Great
Lakes region and left near-freezing temperatures in its wake in the
northern Plains early today.
   Cold Canadian air poured into the north-central part of the
country, dropping temperatures below the freezing mark along the
border and leaving readings in the 30s elsewhere in Minnesota, the
Dakotas, parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Iowa.
   Temperatures also were in the 30s across part of the northern
Rockies.
   Thunderstorms were reported Monday evening in the lower Great
Lakes and northern parts of the upper Ohio Valley. Cloud cover
spread from the Great Lakes to much of the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over much of Arizona on
Monday.
   Today's forecast called for sunshine and highs in the 60s and
70s in much of the nation. Showers were predicted in the central
and northern Appalachians and the eastern Great Lakes and
thunderstorms were expected in Arizona and southern portions of
Nevada and Utah. Snow was forecast for northern Michigan.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s and 50s from the Great
Lakes region to the northern and central Appalachians; in 80s in
southern portions of Florida and Texas, and from central Montana to
much of Oregon and Washington; and in the 80s to mid-90s in the
desert Southwest.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 27 degrees at Warroad,
Minn., to 84 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Nation's Beaches Full of Plastic, Not Medical Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DONNELLY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national beach cleanup has removed about 1.5
million pounds of garbage so far from shorelines, but the cleanup's
coordinator says the all-volunteer effort found that the country's
coasts ``aren't awash with medical waste.''
   Instead, Kathy O'Hara, a marine biologist with the Center for
Environmental Education, said Monday that volunteers mostly picked
up hundreds of tons of plastic, garbage from foreign countries and
traceable debris from cruise ships.
   Data from more than 1,800 miles of beaches in 16 states and
Puerto Rico has been collected, she said. Information from eight
other states and from Costa Rica remains to be compiled.
   ``We found medical wastes in most states, but we are not going
to see an overwhelming amount of it,'' O'Hara said, adding that
such wastes amount to a ``minuscule'' percentage of beach debris.
   This summer, hundreds of thousands of people stayed away from
East Coast beaches after reports of syringes and AIDS-tainted blood
in vials washed ashore. In New York alone, 7,000 items of medical
waste have been collected this year.
   But O'Hara said plastics are the No. 1 beach debris problem as
some types are not expected to disintegrate for up to 400 years. It
also can kill marine life when ingested or when fish and mammals
become entangled in it.
   About 40,000 volunteers have participated in the cleanup effort,
and O'Hara said in most cases they were very specific in
documenting what was found.
   Her organization's purpose in the cleanup is not only to clean
the beaches, but to compile a data base of how much and what kinds
of wastes wash ashore. She said many volunteers picked up items
that had on them the names of cruise ships. Thousands of deflated
balloons were found on the coastlines, evidence that promotional
helium balloon launches are not harmless events, she said.
   Next year, an international treaty that bans dumping plastics in
oceans takes effect. U.S. violators face up to a $25,000 fine. She
said the 1989 national cleanup, when compared to this year's data,
will help document whether the treaty is working.
   Last weekend, thousands of volunteers in New York, New Jersey
and Oregon helped pick up garbage on beaches. The final two states
to participate in the cleanup _ Hawaii and New Hampshire _ will
hold their efforts later this month.

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Surge, Banking Only Partially Restored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices in the capital surged to
the equivalent of $33 a gallon today as government efforts to
restart Burma's two major oil refineries appear stalled.
   A gallon cost about $25 last week while the official price
before rationing was stopped Aug. 25 had been 58 cents.
   Official sources indicated that the refinery in nearby Syriam
had been damaged during a nationwide, anti-government strike and
would take some time to restore. The refinery at Mann, in central
Burma, also appeared not to be functioning.
   Military officers seized power Sept. 18, crushing a popular
uprising against 26 years of authoritarian rule and have since
attempted to revive the shattered economy and administrative
apparatus.
   The state-owned Working People's Daily said today that five
suburban banks would reopen Oct. 17 for partial business. Banks in
downtown Rangoon, closed for nearly two months, resumed operations
last week.
   The newspaper said each customer would only be allowed to
withdraw a maximum of $1,666 a week. They will be allowed to
deposit any amount.
   Most vehicles seen on the road belong to the military or
government which has been drawing on reserve fuel stocks.
   In Mandalay, 440 miles north of Rangoon, gasoline sold for $21 a
gallon although fuel prices in that central Burma city are normally
higher than those in the capital. Residents said the lower price
was accounted for by supplies of gasoline coming across the border
with China.
   Burma's economy, already in a downward spiral before the
political upheaval began last July, has come to a virtual
standstill. Protesting the military suppression, Japan, West
Germany, the United States and others have frozen aid to a country
where the per capita income is estimated at below $200 a year.
   ``You can argue that the annual half billion dollars in foreign
assistance was playing a major role in propping up the official
economy,'' a Western diplomat based in Rangoon said this week.
   Experts say Burma has exhausted its foreign exchange reserves
and owes more than $4 billion to foreign creditors.

<HEAD>Trial of El Rukn Leader Jeff Fort Opens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The murder trial of the leader of what has been
called one of the nation's deadliest street gangs and four
associates has begun amid tight security and fears of disruptions
by gang members.
   In opening arguments Monday, the prosecution said it would prove
its case against gang leader Jeff Fort and the others from the
testimony of three former El Rukns members involved in the shooting
of a rival gang member.
   But defense lawyers said the government's key witnesses were not
credible.
   Security at the Cook County Circuit Court was unusually tight.
Besides the standard metal detector in the front lobby, spectators
were asked to empty their pockets and were checked with hand-held
metal detectors at two other checkpoints.
   Inside the courtroom, the gallery was separated by a bulletproof
glass wall _ constructed for the trial _ from the judge, jury,
attorneys and defendants with their horde of guards.
   ``Let me introduce you to five members of an evil enterprise,''
prosecutor Randy Rueckert told the jurors.
   ``There's one issue in this case, and that's credibility,'' said
Mike McInerney, attorney for defendant Ray Ferguson. ``The defense
contends that these people can't be believed.''
   Fort's attorney, Tom Peters, said his client is a high-profile
scapegoat.
   ``This case is not about anything (Fort) did, or said or
thought. He's here because of who he is,'' Peters said.
   He said his client is a scapegoat for prosecution witnesses who
are cooperating in hopes of getting lighter sentences for their own
crimes.
   Fort, 41, is serving an 80-year federal term for conspiring to
commit acts of terrorism on the United States on Libya's behalf. He
is charged with his four co-defendants in the 1981 death of rival
gang member Willie ``Dollar Bill'' Bibbs, of the gang called the
Titanic Stones.
   Last year Fort and four El Rukns received terms ranging from
nine to 80 years for conspiring to get $2.5 million from Libya in
exchange for acts of terrorism in the United States. The government
said the group had offered to blow up planes and U.S. buildings for
Libya, but committed no terrorist acts.
   The El Rukns, named after the cornerstone of Islam's sacred
shrine in Mecca, claimed their organization is a religious one that
planned no violence and met with Libyans to raise money for a
mosque.
   About 50 of the 250 to 300 hard-core members of the South
Side-based gang have been charged or convicted of state and federal
crimes, authorities said.

Depression</HEAD>

   A mid-Atlantic tropical depression moving slowly
toward the Caribbean may be gathering steam to become a tropical
storm, a forecaster says.
   Satellite pictures indicate the tropical depression could become
better organized today and grow to a tropical storm by late tonight
or early Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center reported.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression was centered near 10.0 north
latitude and 45.6 west longitude, or about 950 miles east-southeast
of Barbados, moving west-northwest at 15 mph with winds near 35
mph, the center said.
   The same motion was expected for the next 24 hours, but
hurricane specialist Hal Gerrish said conditions were favorable for
strengthening into a named storm within 12 hours.
   The depression is the 17th of the Atlantic season, which runs
from June through November. Depressions become named tropical
storms when sustained winds reach 39 mph and hurricanes when winds
hit 74 mph.
   Four hurricanes have formed this season, including Hurricane
Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people and caused billions of
dollars damage as it ravaged Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico.

   A Brazilian engineer fighting the
destruction of the Amazon jungles, a Malaysian environmental group
and a British specialist in housing for the poor today won the
$100,000 Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the ``alternative
Nobel prize.''
   An honorary award, which carries no cash prize, went to
Denmark's Inge Kemp Genefke, founder and director of the
International Rehabilitation and Research Center for Torture
Victims, for her work ``to help those whose lives have been
shattered by torture.''
   The award was established in 1980 by Swedish-German
philanthropist Baron Jakob von Uexkull to encourage practical
solutions to everyday problems.
   Von Uexkull sold a stamp collection to finance an initial
$500,000 endowment for the annual prizes. They will be awarded in
the Swedish parliament on Dec. 9, the eve of the Nobel prize
ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo, Norway.
   The 10-member jury includes von Uexkull, Norwegian explorer Thor
Heyerdahl, former Costa Rican President Rodrigo Carazo and Robert
Muller, a former U.N. assistant secretary general.
   The 1988 winners were Brazil's Jose Lutzenberger, the Friends of
the Earth group fighting the logging industry in the Malaysian
province of Sarawak, and John Turner, a London architect and author
of self-help programs for Third World housing development.
   Von Uexkull told a news conference that the award had ``gained
recognition'' since it was introduced and had helped draw attention
to environmental issues.
   The cash stipend, which the winners will share, is for specific
projects and not for personal use, according to the Right
Livelihood Foundation.
   The timing of the prize is linked to the announcement of the six
Nobel prizes to ensure maximum publicity. The Nobel Peace Prize,
given to the U.N. peacekeeping forces, was announced last week and
the laureates in literature, chemistry, phyisics, economics and
medicine will be made public over the next eight days.
   Von Uexkull created the prize because he believed the Nobel
prizes had become too specialized and removed from issues
concerning everyone.
   He said this year the winners were chosen from among 92
nominations, which can be submitted by anyone.
   The foundation cited Lutzenberger as ``the father of the
environmental movement in Brazil'' who has launched soil
regeneration projects and encourged posion-free agriculture.
   Lutzenberger, 61, quit his job with a Brazilian chemical company
in 1972 to campaign against the overuse of chemicals in farming.
   His criticism of projects funded by the World Bank raised an
environmental awareness into the bank's activities in Brazil and
elsewhere, the foundation said.
   Lutzenberger also helped raise the alarm over the clearing of
the Amazon rain forests for agriculture. ``An area the size of
France and Scotland is burning. At this rate the forests of Brazil
will be destroyed in 20 years,'' von Uexkull said.
   In Malaysia, Sahabat Alam, or The Friends of the Earth, was
recognized for its conflict with the authorities over the
deforestation in Sarawak.
   The foundation cited Harrison Ngau, 28, director of the Sarawak
office, who led a blockade against the a lumber company which it
said was owned by Environment and Tourism Minister James Wong.
   Ngau was arrested for 60 days and was still under orders
restricting his travel, the foundation said.
   John Turner, born in 1927, was honored for encouraging ``the
freedom of communities to plan, build and manage their hown
housing.''
   Turner, founder of the Associated Housing Advisory Services,
argued in a series of publications that Western urban development
should not be imposed on Third World home dwellers.
   The honorary award recognized Genefke's work with torture
victims in the Copenhagen-based research center.
   Von Uexkull said the has documented cases of torture and has
charged that as many as 25,000 people in the medical professions
have been involved in acts of torture.

<HEAD>Former CIA Whistleblower Dies; Involved In Vietnam Troop Strength
Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRAFFORD, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samuel A. Adams, a onetime CIA analyst who
accused his superiors of manipulating intelligence estimates during
the Vietnam War, has died. He was 55.
   Adams, whose accusations helped form the basis of the
CBS-Westmoreland libel case, died Monday at his home in Strafford,
apparently of a heart attack.
   Adams was a CIA expert on the Viet Cong, the guerrilla force
that North Vietnam organized in South Vietnam. He contended that
Army Gen. William Westmoreland's military intelligence officers
were ordered to deliberately underestimate the strength of the
guerrilla force to make it appear the American-backed war was being
won.
   The dispute over the Viet Cong strength was a major controversy
at the CIA, where Adams worked for 10 years. It became the basis
for the 1982 CBS documentary, ``The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam
Deception,'' which resulted in a libel suit against the network by
Westmoreland.
   Westmoreland settled the case out of court after hearing
testimony at his 1985 trial by his former chief of military
intelligence that backed charges made by Adams.
   Adams served as a consultant to the CBS documentary and
testified at the trial, saying, ``I do not believe General
Westmoreland communicated fully to Washington.''
   Concerning the intelligence gathering and reporting of enemy
strength, the ex-CIA analyst said: ``I believe there was a
conspiracy. There was an attempt to do wrong with the numbers. ...
I have always felt that what went on in the 1967-1968 period was a
conspiracy.''
   ``It was a tragic event,'' he said.
   Adams, who graduated from Harvard University in 1955, served as
an officer in the U.S. Navy before joining the CIA in 1963.
   Adams is survived by his wife, Anne Cocroft Adams, and two sons.

<DATELINE>MOUNT WASHINGTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three lost hikers survived snow,
fog and sub-zero wind chills on Mount Washington by burning dollar
bills to keep their fire going, they said after making it off the
treacherous peak.
   The three, fraternity brothers at Northeastern University in
Boston, spent about 25 hours Sunday and Monday on the mountain,
where a storm created four-foot snowdrifts and strong winds dropped
the wind-chill factor to 17 below zero.
   ``We burned dollar bills to stay dry,'' Andy Stewart, 23, of
Syosset, N.Y., said Monday after he and his companions reached
safety by following a dry riverbed down the mountain. None of the
three was harmed by the ordeal.
   Forty rescuers searched mountain trails most of Monday, looking
for Stewart, Matt Dube, 21, of Bethany, Conn., and Steve Sardella,
20, of Marlboro, Mass. A fourth member of the group, Noel Bouvier
of Boston, left the others late Sunday afternoon.
   The four came to New Hampshire to spend the Columbus Day weekend
at a friend's cottage and decided to climb the mountain for fun,
Bouvier said.
   They left the base camp at Pinkham's Notch on the east side of
the mountain at 1 p.m. Sunday, planning to make the four-mile climb
to the summit and return the same night, Bouvier said. The climb
normally takes about four hours.
   They were wearing three layers of clothing and carried extra
sweaters, Bouvier said. The others had hiking boots on, but Bouvier
turned back because his boots had little traction.
   Before reaching the summit, a storm blew in and the three hikers
lost their way. ``I couldn't see my hand in front of my face,''
Stewart said.
   They turned back, hiking until dark, trying to make their way
below the tree line in the hope trees would shelter them from the
wind.
   After dark, they started a fire and ate sandwiches, apples, nuts
and crackers they had carried on the hike.
   ``We burned whatever we could, bank cards, money, phone
numbers,'' Sardella said, without specifying how much cash went up
in smoke. They kept moving around the fire throughout the night to
keep hypothermia from setting in.
   ``There was a point where we really didn't think we were going
to make it,'' said Stewart. But they never verbalized the fear that
they might die, Dube added. ``We all thought it, but never said
it.''
   In the morning, they found a small stream and began following it
down the mountain, jumping from stone to stone. The stream led into
a trail along a dry riverbed on the west side of the mountain, and
that led to Route 302.
   ``The snow was up to my chin all the way down,'' Stewart said.
   Asked if they felt lucky to be alive, Stewart said, ``Oh my God,
yes, incredibly lucky.'' None of the three even needed medical
treatment.
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Maj. Henry Mock of the state Fish and
Game Department, which handles searches.
   Washington is notorious for severe and quickly changing weather.
Snow has fallen on the summit in every month, and the highest
surface wind speed ever recorded _ 231 mph _ was registered at the
observatory in 1934.
   Records compiled by the U.S. Forest Service and others indicate
that 103 people have died on Washington since 1849.

   Sarah York celebrated her birthday a
few days early with children from the low-income neighborhood of
San Miguelito and prepared to return home today to Negaunee, Mich.
   Sarah, who turns 11 on Friday, arrived in Panama on Wednesday as
a guest of the country's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, with whom she exchanged letters after seeing him on
television in March.
   She spent Monday at the mayor's office, the local military
headquarters and with other children who sang ``Happy Birthday.''
   She smiled broadly when presented with a cake with the
Panamanian flag drawn on top. Children also gave her a doll in
native dress, a blouse with detailed applique work done by the Kuna
Indians and a bouquet of flowers.
   A plaque read: ``To Sarah, who with the simplicity that
distinguishes all children expresses the concern of children in the
United States for the destiny of Panamanian children.''
   Relations between Panama and the United States have been
strained by U.S. pressure on Noriega to resign as chief of the
Defense Forces and leave the country. U.S. drug trafficking charges
were leveled against him in February.
   Noriega denies any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   ABC and CBS will broadcast an animated public
service announcement in which two children become ``couch
potatoes'' while watching TV, as a warning to avoid too many hours
in front of the set, network spokesmen say.
   The 30-second cartoon is being offered to the three major
networks and 400 local stations by the American Academy of
Pediatrics.
   It is the academy's first public service announcement designed
to speak directly to children, said Jeff Molter, director of the
group's communications division.
   ``It says be choosy in what you watch, and we think it's good
for children to be choosy in what they watch,'' said CBS Broadcast
Group executive Matthew Margo.
   ABC's director of press relations, Janice Gretemeyer, said the
spot's message ``is consistent with the position that ABC has long
held, that children should be selective in their television
viewing.''
   An NBC spokesman said his network had not yet received the spot
for review.
   Over a toe-tapping instrumental backup and a chorus singing
``couch potato,'' the announcement tells children to ``avoid this
dread disease, be choosy in what you watch. ... Don't just plop in
front of the TV 'cause you've got nothing else to do.''
   It also admonishes children to ``watch out for overeating.''
   On screen, the boy couch potato pleads, ``Leave me alone, just
let me groove with my tube.''
   The girl couch potato gazes at the television and says, ``Got to
have that. ... Mamma, can I buy that?'' while chowing down on a
bowl of snacks.
   The spot ends with a family of couch potatoes turning back into
two children and their parents. The viewer hears: ``Don't be a
couch potato. Couch potato. Not me!''

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis were running
neck-and-neck in a pair of national polls that also found Indiana
Sen. Dan Quayle to be a drag on the Republican ticket.
   A survey of registered voters for the Los Angeles Times showed
the Bush-Quayle ticket leading Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
44-41. When asked to treat Bush and Dukakis as if they were running
alone, the respondents picked Bush over Dukakis 48 percent to 39
percent.
   A margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points in
either direction could close the difference in both cases.
   The Times questioned 893 registered voters on Saturday and
Sunday. Polls of registered voters are less reliable predictors of
the outcome of an election since not everyone votes.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll, Bush had 50 percent to 47
percent for Dukakis. That survey also had a four-point margin of
error.
   The Times poll also found that Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen far
outperformed Quayle in last week's vice presidential debate. But it
also found that Dukakis had a 45 percent unfavorable rating,
compared with 40 percent unfavorable rating for Quayle.
   The ABC-Post poll, in an effort to assess the Quayle ``drag''
among the electorate, found that the effect of Quayle's performance
in the vice presidential debate was to shift about 2 percent of the
electorate to Dukakis. The poll said 16 percent said Quayle was a
major reason for supporting Dukakis.
   The ABC-Post survey of 600 likely voters was conducted
nationwide by telephone from Wednesday through Sunday.

<DATELINE>UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today sentenced a U.S. Air
Force sergeant to six years in prison for killing his wife.
   Sgt. Charles Donald Short, 34, of Highwood, Ill., was convicted
of murdering his wife Esin Hasturk, 31, his attorney, Leo Puts,
said.
   On March 25, Short beat and stabbed his Turkish-born wife to
death, then cut her body into pieces and hid them in plastic
garbage bags.
   The court also committed Short to a mental asylum as his
request, Puts said. The court ruling said there was a real danger
Short might commit similar offenses in the future, Puts said.
   ``The court took into consideration the way he disposed of the
remains of her (his wife's) body'' after the killing, Puts told The
Associated Press.
   Short, who had been serving with the Air Force's 32nd Tactical
Fighter Squadron near the central Dutch town of Soesterberg, killed
his wife because she threatened to leave him and take their
8-month-old son, Puts said.
   The couple had married in 1986 in the Turkish capital Ankara,
where Short was serving at the time.
   Short was arrested March 30 by U.S. military police at
Soesterberg, but handed over to Dutch authorities a day later.
   In July, Short won a Dutch court order barring his transfer back
to U.S. jurisdiction because he could have faced a death sentence
if convicted in the United States. Dutch law bans capital
punishment.

<HEAD>Witness Describes Beating Of Stetham Aboard Hijacked TWA Jetliner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was held captive on a
hijacked TWA jetliner testified today that a Navy diver killed
during the ordeal was beaten so severely he could barely walk.
   Sarah Ashmore, testifying during the murder and air piracy trial
of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, also said that Hamadi robbed her shortly
after the flight was commandeered June 14, 1985 on a flight from
Athens to Rome.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held on the plane for 17 days, and
Navy diver Robert Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., was beaten and shot to
death.
   Referring to the beating of Stethem, Ms. Ashmore said:
   ``He was mobile, but he was staggering in his walk and was being
supported by (chief flight attendant) Uli Derickson. He was moaning
and groaning and Uli was trying to keep him quiet.''
   Ms. Ashmore frequently pressed her hands against her head during
the testimony in the heavily guarded courtroom inside the
Preungesheim prison.
   Outside, police were on patrol, some with machine guns.
   Ms. Ashmore told the court she heard the shot that killed
Stethem but did not see who fired it.
   ``I heard the shot and the body drop, but I couldn't see
anything because the curtain (to first class) was shut,'' Ms.
Ashmore said.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, confessed to being one of the
two gunman who seized the plane but denied killing Stethem.
   Earlier in her testimony, Ms. Ashmore said Hamadi had robbed her.
   Looking directly at Hamadi, she said: ``This is the man who
searched me. This is the man who took my jewelry.''
   Court documents indicate that the hijackers stole jewelry, cash,
cameras and other valuables from passengers after the flight was
seized.
   Ms. Ashmore, 50, who spoke with an American accent, said she had
no doubt about the identities of the two hijackers.
   ``I spent a long time staring at them,'' she said.
   The other hijacker is still at large.
   Ms. Ashmore was not asked to reveal her nationality or residence
under court guidelines designed to protect witnesses.
   During the trial, which began July 5, witnesses have given
gruesome accounts of how Stethem died.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, have attended
each trial session. The elder Stethem usually takes notes during
the proceedings.
   The TWA jetliner was hijacked shortly after it left Athens.
During the hijacking, it was forced to land three times in Beirut
and twice in Algiers.
   Stethem was slain in the early hours of June 15, after the plane
landed in Beirut on its first return flight from Algiers.
   U.S. forensic expert Michael Clark told the court last week that
Stethem lived up to 10 minutes after he was shot and tossed out of
the plane.
   Another U.S. Navy diver, Clinton Suggs, was on the plane and
testified he heard the hijackers shoot Stethem and toss him onto
the runway still moaning.
   Pilot John Testrake told the court he believes Hamadi shot
Stethem but that he did not see who pulled the trigger.
   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 at Frankfurt airport after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   In the week after Hamadi's arrest, two West Germans were
kidnapped in Beirut in what officials said was an attempt to force
Hamadi's release.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, who was arrested at Frankfurt
airport on Jan. 27, 1987 after a flight from Beirut, was convicted
by a Duesseldorf court in April on charges related to the
kidnappings of Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes. He was sentenced
to 13 years imprisonment.
   Both Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes have been freed.

<HEAD>Protecting School's Pupils Was Foremost in Teacher's Mind, She
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher who followed a distraught
gunman through an elementary school and tried to persuade him not
to shoot says protecting the school's pupils was uppermost in her
mind.
   ``I was trying to be real calm,'' physical education teacher Kat
Finkbeiner told reporters Monday, two weeks after a youth went on a
rampage at Oakland Elementary School. ``I knew I had to be. Those
were kids in there _ they were helpless.''
   Two 8-year-old girls were fatally shot and seven children and
two teachers were wounded, including Mrs. Finkbeiner, who was hit
in the mouth and whose jaw remained wired shut.
   Despite her injury, Mrs. Finkbeiner ran in an 8-kilometer (about
5-mile) race this weekend and already has visited the school and
talked with the children. She said she cannot wait until her doctor
lets her return to work, which she hopes will be in the next couple
of weeks.
   The thought of children's questions about what happened doesn't
bother the 17-year teaching veteran. She said she wants to discuss
it openly with the children and help them heal.
   ``Kids will learn to get over this. Kids will talk about it,''
she said.
   Mrs. Finkbeiner said she was just sitting down for lunch shortly
before noon when a gunman walked into the cafeteria and opened fire
on a crowd of about 100 students and teachers. Teacher Eleanor
Hodge was one of the first hit by gunfire as she stood up and held
her hand up at the man.
   Mrs. Finkbeiner said she noticed one little girl left alone in
the cafeteria after the other children ran out the building's back
door. She said shielded the little girl with her body and pushed
her out the door while the gunman held the pistol on them.
   The gunman then left the lunchroom, and Mrs. Finkbeiner said she
followed him down the hall to a restroom, where he stopped to
reload. She tried to hold him in the restroom, but he forced his
way out and trained the gun on her.
   He told her, ``They are trying to kill me,'' she said.
   ``They are just little people. They are not going to hurt you,''
she replied.
   But the man walked away from her and entered a third-grade
classroom at the 600-student school.
   When Mrs. Finkbeiner arrived, the man had the revolver held to
the neck of an 8-year-old boy. She began talking to him, and he
pulled the gun away from the youngster.
   Details are fuzzy after that, she said.
   Apparently the man fired at her, striking her in the mouth and
shattering her jaw. He then began shooting at the pupils,
apparently aiming at children who screamed.
   One girl, Shequila Bradley, died soon after the shooting.
Tequila Thomas died several days later.
   Mrs. Finkbeiner said she carried Shequila to the school's office
and tried to stop the flow of blood from a wound to the girl's neck.
   James W. Wilson, 19, of Greenwood has been charged with murder
and assault and battery with intent to kill. He is undergoing
psychiatric evaluation in the state mental hospital in Columbia.
   Mrs. Finkbeiner said she was thankful to have survived and now
cherishes time with her husband and 2-year-old daughter.
   ``You can bet me that life means more to me,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher traded
defiant words with the IRA as her Conservative Party gathered to
open its convention today in the same hotel where the IRA tried to
blow her up four years ago.
   The convention opened this morning amid tight security.
Overflights by civil air traffic were banned, a Royal Navy
destroyer patrolled off shore and delegates were forced to line up
early outside the conference hall and endure rigorous security
checks.
   Without prior announcement and ringed by security men, Mrs.
Thatcher arrived late Monday with her husband Denis at Brighton's
seafront Grand Hotel. It was badly damaged in the Oct. 12, 1984,
bomb blast that killed five people. Mrs. Thatcher narrowly escaped
injury. The IRA claimed responsibility.
   The four-day convention was the Tories' first there since the
bombing.
   Mrs. Thatcher said upon arrival that her strongest memory was
that the day after the bombing, the convention started on time and
``people flooded in.''
   ``They weren't going to be defeated,'' she said.
   This morning, Mrs. Thatcher attended a private memorial service
at the Church of St. Paul for the victims of the 1984 bombing. She
unveiled a memorial plaque to the five who died, which reads:
``They paid the price of freedom.''
   The Irish Republican Army, in a statement circulated to Irish
news media Monday, said it ``takes great delight from the hysteria
and the expense surrounding the security of Mrs. Thatcher and the
Tories at their Brighton conference.''
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   More than 1,500 police officers were deployed in the normally
staid resort on the south England coast 45 miles from London.
   The outlawed IRA, which declared ``we only have to be lucky
once'' after its failed 1984 assassination attempt against Mrs.
Thatcher, has vowed to kill her. She has said she will not bow to
terrorists.
   On Monday, police ringed the hotel and the adjacent conference
center.
   Inside, a huge slogan, ``Leading Britain Into The 1990s''
dominated the conference hall bedecked in blue, the Tory party
color.
   Mrs. Thatcher and her Conservatives returned to Brighton with
her dominance of British politics looking even more overwhelming
than four years ago.
   She won a third successive five-year term 16 months ago.
   Despite rising inflation and interest rates and a record trade
deficit, the Conservatives arrived in Brighton with a healthy
five-point lead in polls over the opposition Labor Party.
   A recent poll also showed that Mrs. Thatcher, who will turn 63
in Brighton on Thursday, is the choice of 61 percent of Britons as
the most effective leader when compared to alternatives.
   Mrs. Thatcher planned to focus this year's conference on what
her aides call ``active citizenship.'' The idea involves urging
self-responsibility on Britons _ giving more to charity, helping
police in curbing rising crime and making more personal initiatives
and depending less on the welfare state.

   Thousands of workers ended strikes
today in the face of heightened security measures, but other
protesters pressed demands for economic and political changes and
forced out a regional leader.
   A Communist Party leader from the Serbian republic demanded
dismissal of officials from the autonomous province of Kosovo, at
the center of ethnic unrest. Party leaders from Serbia met in
Belgrade to discuss protests fueled by the ethnic problems and by
Yugoslavia's economic crisis.
   Ratomir Vico, a member of Serbia's ruling Politburo, opened the
meeting of the policy-making Central Committee with a denunciation
of ``all those who have formed a real hunters' posse'' against the
Serbian bosses.
   The leaders of Serbia have been viewed by many as backing
rallies by minority Serbs who want greater control over the
provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Serbia's Communist Party chief,
Slobodan Milosevic, supports the movement.
   Milenko Petrovic, a Central Committee member, won applause when
he demanded dismissal of three senior men in leadership of Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. The
meeting was broadcast on national television and radio.
   The leaders of Vojvodina resigned last week after protesters
besieged government buildings.
   In Montenegro, another of Yugoslavia's six republics,
authorities Monday imposed unspecified emergency measures, the
official Tanjug news agency said. Several Yugoslavs speaking on
condition of anonymity reported that civil defense units in
Belgrade were put on a higher level of alert.
   About 15,000 people in Niksic, a town 30 miles from the
Montenegrin capital of Titograd, joined 3,000 steel workers in a
strike and protests Monday, Tanjug said. However, the workers ended
their three-day strike today.
   Workers are angry about national economic problems, including
217 percent inflation, 15 percent unemployment and a $21 billion
foreign debt.
   Protesters in Niksic demanded that Montenegro's police chief be
fired for allowing authorities to use tear gas and clubs to put
down weekend protests. They dramatized their point by hoisting onto
their shoulders a man wearing a gas mask, Tanjug said.
   ``We are not demanding the gallows for those who ordered the
beating up of our comrades, we are only demanding their sacking,''
the agency quoted worker Miloslav Michunovich as saying.
   A member of Montenegro's ruling Presidium, Radivoje Brajovic,
told a rally in Titograd that he was resigning, and the regional
party leadership held an emergency meeting. Later Monday, 1,000
construction workers in Titograd ended their strike in that city.
   The republics of Slovenia and Bosnia Herzegovina issued
statements supporting the national government's denunciation of
nationalist protests.
   ``We reject ... models of a strong state ... and imposition of
socialism and democracy as tailored by the Serbian leadership,''
Communists from Slovenia said Monday.
   But the leadership of Serbia defended its drive for more control
of its two provinces. The Presidium of the Party and the Presidency
of Serbia denounced unidentified politicians and journalists in
Slovenia who it said ``are spreading fear of Serbia.''
   Ethnic tensions, never far from the surface in this country with
numerous rival nationalities, have increasingly come forward in the
growing number of protests this year.
   Many have centered on Kosovo, which borders Albania. Ethnic
Albanians, who are mostly Moslems, outnumber mainly Christian Serbs
there, and the Serbs claims they are being harassed and forced to
leave.
   However, many Yugoslavs elsewhere worry about the growing
nationalism of Serbs, the largest minority in this nation of about
23 million.
   Serbian protesters, some of whom have compared Milosevic with
the late president Josip Broz Tito, have made him their champion in
the hope that he will bolster their status.
   Reacting to the unrest, national leaders have promised economic
reform and changes in leaders when the party's policy-making
Central Committee meets Monday.

   Neighbors of a recently freed
Lebanon hostage cleaned up the yard of his house in preparation for
his homecoming and said they were eager to see him and his wife.
   Mithileshwar Singh, who was released eight days ago by Shiite
Moslem extremists after 21 months in captivity, told a friend he
will be returning here after a few more days of rest.
   ``He indicated he was staying in New York at a complex owned by
American Beirut University,'' said Sybil Curtis, who received a
telephone call from Singh and his wife on Monday. ``Dr. Singh says
they were coming home in a few days but just needed some time to
rest in seclusion.''
   Singh, 60, an Indian who is a resident alien of the United
States, was abducted Jan. 24, 1987, at Beirut Univerity College
with three American colleagues by a group calling itself the
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. He was chairman of
the school's business department.
   After his release Oct. 3, Singh was taken to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, for medical checks and debriefing at the U.S. military
hospital there. He left Sunday for the United States.
   Singh had taught at Western Colorado University, living in a
rented home. The house is now vacant and things have run down, said
neighbors, who decided to hold a yard clean-up Monday before Singh
and his wife, Lala Mani, arrive.
   ``The weeds have just really taken over. We felt we wanted to
get the yard up in shape because it was so nice when he lived
there,'' said Ginger Duffy.
   She said Singh and his wife were good neighbors and everyone on
the block would welcome him back.
   Three others kidnapped with Singh _ Jesse Turner, 41; Alann
Steen, 49; and Robert Polhill, 54 _ continue to be held. Six other
Americans also are being held in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   This summer's heat cost residents of the
northern plains states more than $40 each in added air conditioning
expense, according to a new government study released today.
   The typical American home spent $422 on electricity during the
May-September cooling season, but the expense ranged widely from
area to area, according to monthly climate impact assessments
issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``Very high summer temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast
were tempered by near-normal readings in the southern states, where
the cooling customers are concentrated,'' the report noted.
   Thus, the national summer electricity costs, which are largely
affected by air conditioning demand, were only 4 percent above
normal for the season.
   Even so, that spending totaled $17.4 billion, some $712 million
more than would have been expected had average summer weather
prevailed across the nation.
   The $422 average summer electricity bill for this year was $17
more than normal, the report said.
   Here is a region-by-region rundown of seasonal electricity
costs, per household, and the difference from what would have been
expected in normal weather.
   _West North Central, $434, $46 more than normal. Includes North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and
Missouri.
   _East North Central, $387, $40 more than normal. Includes
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   _Mid-Atlantic, $355, $23 more than normal. Includes New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   _Mountain, $371, $21 more than normal. Includes Montana, Idaho,
Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico.
   _New England, $258, $15 more than normal. Includes Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   _East South Central, $438, $12 more than normal. Includes
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama.
   _South Atlantic, $473, $5 more than normal. Includes Maryland,
Delaware, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
   _West South Central, $566, $2 more than normal. Includes
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana.
   _Pacific, $239, normal. Includes Washington, Oregon and
California.
   The monthly climate analysis does not calculate energy costs for
Alaska and Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people returned to work and
some shops reopened in Algiers today after the president promised
to address economic complaints that caused a week of blood riots.
   President Chadli Bendjedid, speaking to the nation Monday night,
also hinted he may not run for another term.
   His address came hours after troops fired machine guns into a
crowd of more than 10,000 in the Algiers district of Bab-el-Oued.
Witnesses estimated that 25 to 30 people were killed. Dozens of
others were wounded, some seriously.
   One witness said he saw many bodies. ``The soldiers were piling
them into trucks, one body on top of another,'' he said on
condition of anonymity.
   The government has provided no casualty figures, but reliable
reports from police, hospitals and other sources indicate that as
many as 300 have died in the week of unrest. The government
declared a state of emergency Thursday and authorized troops to
fire on demonstrators if necessary to disperse them.
   Monday's demonstration was to be a peaceful protest march
organized by the Islamic fundamentalist Movement for Algerian
Renewal, which has demanded the government resign today. It was not
immediately clear how the violence began.
   The army remained in control of sensitive points in the capital
of Algiers today, including the National Assembly, the main
newspaper El Moudjahid and critical road junctions.
   But they remained quiet, and helicopters stopped low-level
overflights. Some shops reopened as many workers went back to their
jobs.
   Under the government's austerity program, prices of many
formerly subsidized food staples have risen 40 percent since
January. A combination of rapidly rising prices and shortages have
led to widespread disgruntlement.
   The unrest began about two weeks ago with a series of strikes
demanding higher wages to keep up with inflation.
   The national news agency and state-controlled newspapers printed
the president's speech and praised his ``realism and political
courage.''
   The speech, which in fact contained little new, carried the
suggestion he might not seek a third five-year term at the congress
of the governing National Liberation Front party in December.
   Bendjedid promised far-reaching political reforms to go
hand-in-hand with previously announced economic reform measures,
but he gave no details.
   The Islamic fundamentalists who struggled to take control of the
revolt issued no statements today. However, they are likely to
reappear, particularly during funerals for demonstrators shot down
by the army Monday in Bab-el-Oued.
   The president said on national radioo and television Monday
night he was ``bitterly sorry for the material and human losses''
in the street violence.
   ``My duty as the person with supreme responsibility for this
country was to make the decisions necessary to protect the nation,
whatever the circumstances, and whatever the difficulties,'' he
said. ``We have the courage to recognize our mistakes and to
restore the situation. I would like you to help me.''
   It had been widely expected that the congress of the governing
National Liberation Front would amend the constitution to permit
him to be nominated for a third term. As the sole candidate, his
election would be a certainty.
   In his speech, he said he ``swore to respect the popular will
and to facilitate the rise of young people to the leadership.'' But
these changes must take place calmly, he said.

   A group of Goddard College students
continued to occupy the school's administration building today
after pledging to remain until its demands on school and global
issues are met.
   Eight to 10 students took over Goddard's Community Center on
Sunday evening, and issued a list of demands on Monday. They were
still there this morning, said college President Jack Lindquist,
adding that he was considering calling in the police if the sit-in
continued.
   ``A police presence on the campus tends to excite some students,
and so I would prefer not to do that if I don't have to,'' he said.
   He said he and most staff members were sympathetic to the
students, though the college could do little about demands related
to national and world problems. So far, he said late Monday, the
protesters had not agreed to meet with him.
   The students' demands range from school issues, such as
increasing student participation in the administration of the
college and full disclosure of the school's financial records, to
freeing South African activist Nelson Mandela, ending homelessness
in America and stopping nuclear testing.
   Goddard, with an enrollment of 370, is regarded as a haven for
the counter-culture, praised by friends for innovation and damned
for what critics term academic laxity.
   ``We feel the time time has come to take serious and definitive
action to arrest apathy at our school, to arrest mediocrity, to
address why our school has become dysfunctional,'' a student
protester who gave his name as Zenzile said Monday. He spoke from
behind a second-floor doorway blocked with chairs and bedsprings.
   Lindquist said the demonstration was ``in many, many ways very
healthy'' and said most college faculty and staff members were
sympathetic with the students' goals.
   ``That's one of the reasons I have hope this thing will work
itself out,'' he said.
   He added: ``Of course, some of the staff are very irate about
being denied access to their place of work.'' A continuing protest
could delay staff paychecks, he said.
   While the students were inside the administration building,
another student group met throughout the day Monday to identify its
goals and see whether it could help resolve the grievances of the
protesters.

<TEXT>
   East German authorities have succeeded in
separating an East Berlin man from his West Berlin lover, but that
hasn't stopped the woman from sending airborne love messages over
the Berlin Wall.
   To dramatize her plight this past weekend, Kerstin Vockert
launched balloons on the breeze to East Berlin carrying scraps of
paper with a message of love drawn from Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet to her fiance Peter Rozinat.
   The romantic message is from a German translation of
Shakespeare. The original English version of the passage reads:
``With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls ... for
stony limits cannot hold love out.''
   The couple's troubles began when they met a year ago in East
Berlin.
   Ms. Vockert, 29, said: ``It was love at first sight.''
   They soon decided to marry, but bureaucracy and East Germany's
tough emigration policies proved insurmountable, Ms. Vockert said.
   ``I am no longer allowed to go over and see him and Peter can't
get out,'' Ms. Vockert said.
   She said his requests to marry and leave the country have been
refused and that he was warned by authorities not to press the
issue.
   Ms. Vockert said officials denied the request because Rozinat
recently left the military and wasn't allowed to leave the country.
   But she added that authorities gave no indication how long
Rozinat will have to wait before he can join her in the West.
   ``The East German officials are treating us like criminals. We
are being lied to everywhere,'' Ms. Vockert said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today proposed a plan
aimed at restoring U.S. dominance in science and technology to
allow development of new American products that would compete
successfully in foreign markets.
   ``We've got to win the battle to be No. 1 in the technologies of
the future,'' the Democratic nominee told students at Tufts
University. ``We've got to build new industries. We've got to
modernize our old ones so we can make top-of-the-line products and
earn top-of-the-line paychecks.''
   Dukakis expanded on his theme of economic nationalism at Tufts
after he went on nationwide television to accuse Republican rival
George Bush of ``very crass and cynical'' tactics in making a
campaign issue of the Massachusetts prison furlough system.
   Dukakis spoke a few hours before flying to Los Angeles for his
second and final debate with the vice president on Thursday, which
he said would give millions of American voters ``a good sense of
who I am and the kind of leadership I can provide.''
   The Massachusetts governor said that only improvements in
science education and technology development would lead to
restoration of U.S. dominance in manufacturing and marketing of
high-tech consumer goods.
   ``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact
discs to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to
the Ayatollah,'' he said.
   Dukakis delighted the friendly crowd with this and other
partisan salvos, including a jibe at Bush running mate Dan Quayle.
   ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that if he ever had to fill in
for George Bush, America could get by on a wing and a prayer,'' he
said.
   Dukakis' science proposal included asking the National Science
Foundation to draft annual, state-by-state report cards on the
quality of science education, and programs to improve science
teaching.
   He also proposed recruiting active and retired scientists and
engineers to teach on at least a part-time basis, creating
workplace centers to retrain employees for new technologies, and
establishing a network of national centers of excellence modeled
after state programs that encourage research and technology
development.
   The vice president has repeatedly cited the case of Willie
Horton Jr., a convicted murderer who escaped while on a weekend
furlough granted by the Massachusetts prison system last year and
later slashed a man and twice raped his fiancee.
   ``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes,
that's kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics,'' Dukakis
said, adding that similar tragedies had occurred under the federal
furlough program and another instituted in California when
President Reagan was governor of that state in the early 1970s.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' the
Massachusetts governor said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``And I think
it's frankly because Mr. Bush has never done anything on law
enforcement and crime. Whenever he's been given an assignment (in
the Reagan administration) he's failed.''
   Dukakis vowed that during his nationally televised debate with
Bush in Los Angeles and in the remaining four weeks of the
campaign, ``I think the American people are going to come to know
Mike Dukakis and who he is and how strongly he believes in their
concerns.''
   Dukakis spent several hours Monday night preparing for his
showdown with Bush, which he and his aides view as crucial to his
chances of overcoming Bush's apparent lead in most polls.
   ``This one is out there to be won. You know it and I know it,''
an upbeat Dukakis told a Columbus Day gathering in Levittown, N.Y.
The Democratic nominee then marched in New York City's parade,
where he was enthusiastically received by thousands lining the
streets, many toting Dukakis placards.
   The Massachusetts governor was flanked by New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, Mayor Edward Koch and John F. Kennedy Jr. as he strolled
through Manhattan.
   Levittown, a model community of post World War II housing
programs, served as a symbolic backdrop for Dukakis' announcement
of his housing plan, which would allow first-time home buyers to
use up to $10,000 of their IRAs or pension plans for a down payment.
   It also would amend federal housing programs to put home
ownership _ which Dukakis called the ``cornerstone of the American
dream'' _ within the reach of five million families who now rent
because they cannot afford to buy a home, Dukakis aides said. It
would complement a previously announced program to promote
construction of new, affordable housing through partnerships with
building and trade unions and developers, they said.
   Dukakis recalled bipartisan post-war efforts in Levittown and
across the nation to ``promise to provide affordable housing for
all Americans'' but said the Reagan administration ``broke that
promise in the early 1980s.''
   The Dukakis ``Home START'' program would allow up to $10,000 to
be removed from IRA accounts or 401K pension systems for a housing
down payment without a tax penalty that they would currently face
by making such a withdrawal.
   It also would change Federal Housing Administration regulations
to raise the maximum loan amount to bring it more in line with
current market prices and allow first-time buyers to get an
FHA-insured mortgage with only a 3 percent down payment.
   Campaign advisers said the principal cost of the home ownership
plan would be an estimated $400 million loss in tax revenue
resulting from the increased incentive for people to contribute to
Individual Retirement Accounts.

   One of the 16 cadets hospitalized
after strenuous physical training in the first week of a class at
the Agawam police academy was readmitted to a hospital today with
intestinal bleeding.
   Another cadet has been hospitalized since he collapsed from heat
stroke on the first day of a new class at the regional academy for
municipal police departments in western Massachusetts. Timothy
Shepard of Pittsfield underwent a liver transplant two weeks ago.
   In the wake of the allegations of abuses at the academy, the
state's chief medical examiner has reopened an investigation into
an earlier death of a cadet at an academy in eastern Massachusetts.
   A lawyer for the family of Cadet James Whitehouse of Braintree,
who died in 1985, said Monday he would call for an inquest if he
was not satisfied with investigations by the medical examiner's
office, the attorney general's office and the Criminal Justice
Training Council, which runs the state's six police academies.
   Cadet Joseph Metcalfe of Ludlow was in serious condition today
at the intensive care unit at Baystate Medical Center and may have
to undergo surgery, said spokesman Joseph Bradley.
   A nursing supervisor who asked not to be identified said early
this morning after Metcalfe was admitted that he was ``bleeding
heavily and is pretty bad.''
   However, Bradley said Metcalfe appeared to be improving.
   Metcalfe was among the class of 50 cadets who apparently
underwent a strenuous exercise regimen with little water the first
day of class, Sept. 19. He was treated for kidney problems that
required dialysis treatment.
   Metcalfe's boss, Ludlow Police Chief John Jorge, said Metcalfe
had been allowed back to the academy last week by his doctor.
   The state Department of Public Safety had suspended physical
punishment at the police academies, but it was unclear if physical
training had resumed. Spokesmen for the department could not be
reached this morning for comment.
   The nursing supervisor said he didn't know if the cadet's latest
health problems were related to his police training, but said he
had been healthy before beginning his training.
   ``Common sense would tell you there's probably some
relationship,'' the supervisor said.
   North Adams Mayor John Barrett III blasted a state agency
spokesman Monday for his suggestion that the state would not help
cover the medical bills of cadets who fell ill at the state-run
academy. One of the cadets from his town spent a week in the
hospital.
   ``The state has messed this whole thing up,'' Barrett said.
``We're self-insured, but we're looking for somebody to pick up the
tab for these guys if it doesn't cover 100 percent.''
   State Attorney General James Shannon, whose office is
investigating the illnesses, said the payment will be worked out
between the city and state.

<HEAD>Arson Attack On Pro-Independence Newspaper in Namibia</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ A fire set by arsonists
gutted the offices of a pro-independence newspaper, the paper's
staff said today.
   Gewn Lister, editor of The Namibian, said the weekly newspaper
would continue publishing despite the destruction of computers,
telephones and furniture in the fire Monday night.
   The Namibian, which has a circulation of 9,500, was founded
three years ago with financial assistance from the European
Economic Community.
   The newspaper has supported the South-West African People's
Organization, which wages a political and military campaign to end
South African rule over South-West Africa, commonly known as
Namibia.
   Reporters said a window of the newspaper office was broken and
kerosene-soaked packets were thrown inside.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

<HEAD>Foreign Agents Visit US Nuke Labs, Report Says</HEAD>

   Lax security at Energy Department nuclear
weapons laboratories has allowed agents from Iran, the Soviet bloc
and other countries to gain access to sensitive research
facilities, congressional investigators reported today.
   The visits took place at the national laboratories at Los Alamos
and Sandia in New Mexico and at Livermore in California, where
scientists conduct advanced research on nuclear weapons and the
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, according to the
report by the General Accounting Office.
   The foreign visitors included specialists from the Soviet bloc,
China and nations believed either to have nuclear weapons or are
seeking to develop them, including India, Pakistan, Israel, Brazil
and Argentina.
   Also allowed into the plants were visitors from both Iran and
Iraq, the report said.
   Officials at the FBI and CIA declined to discuss possible
espionage investigations stemming from the incidents and it was not
clear whether any secrets had been lost, according to the report by
the agency, the investigative arm of Congress.
   Formally delivering the report to the Senate Governmental
Operations Committee, the GAO's senior associate directgor, Keith
Fultz, said that his inspectors ``could not determine if sensitive
or classified information has been lost'' but added that ``because
of ... weaknesses in DOE's foreign visitor controls, we have little
confidence that adeaquate protection of weapons-related information
and technology is achieved.''
   One member of the committee, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said that
``there may be a strong possibility that we will today only be
looking at the tip of a monstrous iceberg.''
   The Energy Department ``generally does not follow its own
requirements and obtain background information on foreign visitors
and assignees from communist and other sensitive countries,'' the
GAO report said.
   As a result, it said, ``suspected foreign agents and individuals
from facilities suspected of conducting nuclear weapons activities
have obtained access to the laboratories without prior DOE
knowledge,'' the report said.
   It found the department ``allows foreign nationals from
communist and proliferation risk countries into the laboratories to
discuss subjects that could assist nuclear weapons programs.''
   ``I can tell you from my point of view, I personally know of no
prolonged visit from any foreign national,'' said Nigel Hey,
spokesman for Sandia.
   Hey said foreign visitors must make formal application through
the Department of Energy ... ``so actually you can see that the
actual procedure that's followed to clear access to Sandia is in
the hands of the Department of Energy.''
   He said further comment would be impossible without first seeing
the GAO report.
   Congressional investigators found that of the 6,700 foreigners
allowed to visit the weapons laboratories between January 1986 and
September 1987, 222 were from communist countries and 675 were from
other countries deemed to be espionage or proliferation risks,
including 25 from Iran and two from Iraq.
   Congressional researchers reviewed the visits of 181 individuals
from communist countries and found that 176 should have required
checks with lists maintained by the FBI and CIA.
   Only six of the checks were completed before the visits took
place and no checks whatsoever were conducted on 119 of the
individuals, the report said.
   In some cases, the request for a check was made as long as six
months before the visit took place but was not completed in time,
it said.
   The report said that at least three of the foreigners visiting
the facilities were later found to be suspected intelligence
agents, but it did not identify them by nationality.
   Additionally, ``three individuals that a federal agency told us
were obtaining U.S. nuclear weapons development and other sensitive
information were allowed into laboratories on several occasions,''
the report said.
   Such visits can last more than a week and involve discussions
that could be useful to a nation constructing nuclear weapons, the
report said.
   The report said Energy Department officials questioned during
preparation of the report ``acknowledge that these problems exist.
However, they stated that they are improving their procedures for
obtaining background data.''
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, said Monday that
he was unfamiliar with the report but would attempt to obtain
comment.
   Of the countries cited in the report, India has exploded what it
calls a ``peaceful nuclear device;'' Israel is thought to have
produced and stockpiled nuclear weapons; Pakistan is thought to be
very close to being able to build a bomb; and there have been
reports that Brazil and Argentina have conducted nuclear weapons
research, according to U.S. government officials and Leonard
Spector, an expert on nuclear issues at the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace and author of several books on proliferation.
   The Energy Department has come under renewed scrutiny on Capitol
Hill over a series of internal memoranda released over the past two
weeks indicating that as many as 30 mishaps at the department's
Savannah River Plant have not been reported to headquarters or
disclosed to the public over the last three decades.
   Department officials say they are trying to improve procedures
at the plant, which produces plutonium and tritium for the
production of nuclear weapons.
   The three reactors at Savannah River have been shut down while
engineers determine how to make them operate more safely. In
addition, the Energy Department said this week that the primary
plutonium processing facility at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant outside Denver has been shut down because of a ``minor safety
incident'' that happened last month.

<HEAD>Teachers Strike in Arkansas Idles 21,000 Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers in Arkansas' second-largest
school district walked off the job today after the board of
education rejected a mediation committee's recommendation that they
be given a 3 percent raise.
   Classes for 21,000 students in the Pulaski County Special School
District were canceled. The district covers all the schools in the
county, where Little Rock is located, except the Little Rock and
North Little Rock schools.
   Elsewhere, teachers strikes in Pennsylvania, Illinois and
Michigan disrupted classes for an additional 14,000 students.
   The Arkansas strike was only the second in the state in recent
history.
   ``We are very disappointed with the decisions that have brought
us to this point,'' Pulaski Association of Classroom Teachers
spokesman Dan McElderry said as teachers gathered at a park before
sunrise for a rally.
   ``We'd much rather be in the classroom, doing what we've been
trained to do,'' said McElderry, chairman of PACT's Crisis
Committee. ``But we have taken all that we can take, and it's time
that the public knew that we intend to support what we've been
saying for the last several months.''
   On Monday night, the school board voted to deny the district's
1,300 teachers the recommended 3 percent raise, saying the system
couldn't afford it because it already faces a $1.9 million deficit.
The raise would have cost an estimated $1.03 million.
   Teachers had warned that they would strike if the recommendation
was rejected, and PACT President Joyce Elliott said that they would
picket every school in the district except an elementary school at
Little Rock Air Force Base. The union had said teachers would not
attempt to picket on federal property.
   School board president Sheryl Dunn said she was ``absolutely
devastated'' by the teachers' decision to strike. ``We tried so
hard to come to a point that we could agree on something to find
the money for the teachers. They just won't wait, and all I can say
is how desperately sorry I am.''
   School Superintendent Bobby Lester said the board would be
willing to reopen negotiations when more money is available for
teacher salaries. That could come if a $2.5 million lawsuit against
the state is settled.
   District voters rejected a property tax increase in May.
   The state with the most teachers on strike today was
Pennsylvania, where 600 teachers and 10,000 students were affected
in five districts. In the Spring-Ford district, the strike resumed
today after a 30-day cooling-off period expired. That strike
affected 200 teachers and 3,300 students.
   Illinois had one strike affecting 65 teachers and 1,000
students, while Michigan had one strike affecting 150 teachers and
3,000 students.

   Lawrence A. Spiegel, a former Associated
Press newsman and aide to Gov. Joseph E. Brennan, has died at his
home after a long illness. He was 40.
   Spiegel, who died Monday, most recently was a partner in a
public relations firm in Portland and a member of the Wicked Good
Band, a folk group that formed when its members were in high school.
   A 1966 graduate of Deering High School in Portland, Spiegel
attended Amherst College before joining the Portland Press Herald
as a reporter in 1970. He joined The Associated Press in Augusta in
1972, going on to become correspondent in Springfield, Mass., in
1973, and in Providence, R.I., in 1974 before leaving the AP at the
end of that year.
   He served as press secretary, speechwriter and special assistant
to Brennan between 1978 and 1984.
   Spiegel is survived by his wife, Nancy Cohen Spiegel, and a son,
David Lee. Funeral services were set for Wednesday in Portland.

   U.S. and Filipino officials reached
tentative agreement for Washington to provide compensation of more
than $550 million a year to use its six military bases in the
Philippines, sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters
the two sides had nearly finished reviewing an agreement governing
the bases, which are the largest U.S. garrison in southeast Asia.
An accord on new compensation terms through 1991 is expected within
a week, they said.
   In Washington, a U.S. official who has kept a close eye on the
negotiations denied there was an agreement. The official refused to
be identified.
   The United States now pays about $180 million a year for the
bases.
   The sources in Manila, who are close to the talks, said
negotiators agreed on a basic annual compensation package of $550
million to $580 million in economic support, military assistance
and commodities, mostly wheat.
   Filipino negotiators in Washington were bargaining for an
additional loan of $100 million to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds,
said the sources. The bonds would be used to pay off $200 million
of the Philippines' $28 billion debt.
   Three Manila newspaper said such a loan would be made, but they
did not say for how much.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno told reporters the size
of the compensation package had not been decided on. He said
officials were still discussing ``creative'' portions, meaning the
debt relief part.
   Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told reporters that
the proposed loan figure was too insignificant to even negotiate at
all.
   ``It will be able to buy back at most $200 million, which is not
worth talking about,'' she told reporters. ``We should be talking
about a $700 million buy-back scheme.''
   On Monday, a Filipino source told The Associated Press that the
two sides had finished reviewing an agreement governing U.S. bases,
and an agreement on their status through 1991 is possible within a
week.
   ``It's over. An agreement is possible within a few days, maybe
within a week's time,'' said the source, who demanded anonymity.
   ``There was compromise on both sides,'' said the source, who is
involved in the talks. He said both panels were working on the
wording of the agreement.
   In April, U.S. and Philippine panels began talks on the status
of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay Naval base and four smaller
installations in the Philippines. But the talks have stalled over
compensation and other issues.
   Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus has been meeting
with U.S. officials in New York and Washington since last month on
the bases talks. He is expected to return to Manila this week.
   The United States maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement
which expires in 1991. The current talks are to determine
compensation, base security and other issues through the final
years of the agreement.
   After that, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases is
strong. President Corazon Aquino refuses to say whether she will
support an extension.
   The Filipino panel reportedly demanded up to $1.2 billion
annually for the final two years of the agreement.
   BusinessWorld, one of the Manila newspapers, quoted an
unidentified source as saying the Americans were ``highly
resistant'' to the $1.2 billion figure because U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz had publicly branded Filipino demands as ``out
of bounds.''
   The source also reportedly said U.S. officials had made clear
they would not support a proposed international aid plan for the
Philippines unless agreement was reached on the bases.
   The Journal also said the United States had tentatively agreed
to waive legislation which adds a 50 percent penalty payment to
U.S. purchases of non-American products.
   This would enable the bases to increase their purchases of
Philippine products, the newspaper said.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino met in Manila with Undersecretary of
State Michael Armacost. Later, they told reporters the two
countries have narrowed differences over the bases issue and are
nearing an agreement.

Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new divorce lawyer for actress Robin
Givens says he would like to negotiate a settlement with her
husband, heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.
   New York attorney Raoul Felder told The Associated Press on
Monday that Miss Givens loves the millionaire prizefighter, whom
she accused of beating her and threatening to kill her, but there
appears no chance to save the eight-month marriage.
   Miss Givens, who last week hired famed ``palimony'' lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson to oversee the breakup of her marriage, changed
lawyers Monday, hiring Felder.
   Meanwhile, Tyson charged that his wife and her mother had seen
to it that he was sedated on prescription drugs during his
appearance on ABC television late last month.
   ``They were giving the medicine to my friend ... to give to
me,'' Tyson told the New York Post in a story published today.
``They wanted him to make sure I took it.''
   He said the drugs had been prescribed by a psychiatrist to tame
his allegedly manic-depressive behavior. Other experts have
concluded that Tyson is not manic-depressive.
   On the television show, ``20-20,'' Tyson was seen sitting and
watching while Miss Givens claimed that he had abused her and made
married life ``torture ... pure hell.'' Two days after it was
aired, police were called to the couple's New Jersey mansion after
a reportedly violent episode involving Tyson, but no charges were
filed.
   Felder said in a telephone interview from New York the case
filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court would be handled by one
of his West Coast associates rather than by Mitchelson.
   ``I don't like to say `fired','' Felder said. ``She severed her
relationship (with Mitchelson) and hired me.''
   Sources, however, told the Daily News in New York that Miss
Givens and her mother, Ruth Roper, were angered because Mitchelson
agreed to appear on the CBS-TV ``This Morning'' program. A
Mitchelson spokesman said the appearance was canceled after the two
women ordered the lawyer to stop talking about the divorce, the
newspaper reported today.
   Mitchelson, who established a live-in companion's right to
alimony-type payments in the celebrated ``palimony'' case against
the late actor Lee Marvin, refused to comment on reports of his
firing. He referred questions to Felder.
   According to the New York newspaper, Miss Givens told friends
that she urged Felder to try to settle out of court.
   ``She said she wants to settle,'' an unidentified friend told
the Daily News. ``She said it could be easily resolved `if Michael
apologizes to me'.''
   Tyson, whose worth is estimated at $40 million, is looking look
for a home in Cleveland so he can work out at promoter Don King's
training camp east of the city, a spokesman for King said Monday.
   Tyson, who lives in New Jersey, and King met for much of the day
at King's home in Windsor, east of Cleveland, said spokesman Paul
Sciria.
   Friends reportedly are advising Tyson to try to have the
marriage annulled to protect his assets. Grounds for the annulment
would be that Miss Givens duped him into marriage by claiming she
was pregnant. Miss Givens denies that.

<HEAD>Court to Review Award of Fees Lawyers' Fees in Kansas City
Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review the
award of more than $4 million in fees to lawyers who won a Kansas
City school desegregation lawsuit.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Missouri officials who
want to reduce the amount.
   State and city officials were held responsible for segregation
in the city school system, and were ordered in 1985 to spend $87.7
million to improve and integrate the schools.
   A federal judge then ordered the state to pay more than $1.7
million to Arthur A. Benson II of Kansas City, the leading attorney
for the suing students, and $2.3 million to the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund for its work.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the attorneys' fees
in January under a federal civil rights law which awards them to
lawyers who win such cases.
   The appeals court rejected claims by the civil rights lawyers
and by state officials who said, respectively, the fees were too
low or too high.
   Benson said he and his staff were not compensated adequately for
what was described as an extraordinary commitment of time and
energy.
   For three years Benson worked full-time on the case and devoted
substantial portions of five additional years to the suit. He said
he borrowed more than $730,000 to help pay the cost of the
litigation.
   Also, Benson argued that his fees should be higher because he
took the case on a contingency basis _ meaning he would get paid
only if he won the suit.
   But the appeals court noted that the judge who declined to order
higher fees said there was a ``high likelihood of success'' for the
segregation suit, minimizing the risk to Benson.
   One of the reasons for ``enhancing'' fees in contingency cases
is to assure there will be lawyers available to take difficult
civil rights suits.
   But the 8th Circuit court said there was insufficient proof the
Kansas City students would have had trouble finding another lawyer
if Benson had refused the case.
   Missouri officials argued that the legal fees were inflated
improperly because Benson and the Legal Defense Fund were paid
extra to compenate them for waiting years for their fees.
   The state appeal also said that the civil rights lawyers were
compensated improperly for the time they spent on segregation
claims not upheld by the courts. The fees should be less because
the lawyers achieved only partial success, they said.
   The state appeal said Kansas City should share in reimbursement
of the attorneys' fees.
   The appeals court rejected all of the state's claims.
   The Legal Defense Fund did not appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear Benson's appeal for
additional compensation.
   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-64.

   The sheriff does not recommend it as a

would-be bad man.
   An unidentified man entered Red's Supermarket on Sunday
afternoon and gave the clerk a note reading, ``This a holdup.''
   The busted syntax was too much for the clerk, who broke up in
laughter, said Isle of Wight County Sheriff Charles Phelps.
Likewise, the laughter was too much for the suspected robber, who
fled the store after taking a 69-cent package of cigars.
   While laughter turned aside this robber, ``I don't recommend
that to everybody,'' said Phelps.
   Police are still searching for the suspect.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush accused Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis today of being ``willing to scare people'' for
political gain by engaging in ``protectionist demagoguery'' about
foreign investments in the United States.
   In a prepared speech for Seattle University Business School
students, the vice president said Dukakis is ``stoking fears about
foreign influence'' in the United States.
   ``My opponent needs an issue and he's willing to scare people to
find it, so like the `Know Nothing Party' a century before him,
he's turned to fear of foreigners,'' Bush said.
   ``He's not a Know Nothing _ he knows better. But perhaps he's a
feel nothing candidate, or maybe, with this later flip-flop, he's
become a believe nothing candidate,'' he said.
   ``Frankly, I've been surprised at my opponent's recent turn to
protectionist demagoguery. I don't think he really believes it. He
ran against this so-called economic nationalism in the primaries.''
   Bush, who is heading for Los Angeles for his second and final
debate with the Democratic nominee Thursday night, also promised to
``throw the book at insider traders and other white-collar
criminals.''
   ``We must not let Wall Street steal from Main Street,'' he said.
   Bush added that most of those who work on Wall Street are
``honest, hard-working people'' and that ``much of the money made
there is recycled to foundations to help the poor, universities and
other worthy causes.''
   On Monday in Trenton, N.J., Bush portrayed Dukakis as soft on
crime and promised as president to show more sympathy for victims
of crimes than for criminals.
   ``I think there is something very wrong when there is so much
sympathy for criminals and very little left over for victims,''
Bush said, who has made a major campaign issue of the Massachusetts
prison furlough system under Dukakis as governor.
   The campaign trip to the West Coast begins an eight-day swing
concentrating on California, the nation's biggest Election Day
prize with 47 electoral votes.
   Campaigning before Thursday's debate will be light to give Bush
time to prepare for his last face-to-face confrontation with his
rival. However, the GOP nominee is planning another tough-on-crime
event in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
   Targeting Democratic ``swing voters'' in New Jersey, which is
seen as a state winnable by either candidate, Bush proposed on
Monday to increase criminal penalties and give victims an expanded
role in criminal proceedings.
   Bush said victims of crime ``should have the statutory right to
be informed of, be present and be heard at every critical stage of
the criminal justice process.''
   He also called for expanding a federal fund created to
compensate victims of crimes.
   ``I'm going to bring an attitude to the White House that has
more sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals,''
the vice president said in his Columbus Day address.
   Bush had been speaking at length about the gang and drug
problems, although none of his campaign stops have been in inner
cities and heavily minority communities where those problems are
most rampant.
   As to why Bush has visited almost all-white, suburban
communities while hitting the anti-crime theme, press secretary
Sheila Tate said, ``The strategy is determined by the political
numbers crunchers that know where the vice president has to go to
have the greatest impact on that state.''
   The speech today was dealing with white-collar crime and thus
the business-student audience was appropriate, Ms. Tate said.
   On Monday, Bush walked for a few blocks in an Italian-American
neighborhood in Trenton, stumping for ethnic votes.
   Bush's political director, Rich Bond, said the New Jersey swing
was aimed at Democrats who crossed party lines to vote for
President Reagan in 1980 and 1984, a group being ardently courted
by both Bush and Dukakis.
   ``We're going after Reagan Democrats. You're not going to see
many Republicans here,'' said Bond.
   Bush aides were heartened by a poll in Monday's Bergen Record
showing him leading Dukakis by eight percentage points in New
Jersey.
   Earlier, Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force
Two that he favors review of the federal prison furlough program,
although he has no specific revisions in mind. ``I just ... want to
be sure it never slips into the Massachusetts model,'' he said.
   Bush's criticism of the program, which until modified allowed
convicted murderers to be released on weekend passes, has prompted
Dukakis to criticize the federal furlough system.
   And Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, in a
statement released Monday, criticized Bush's comments.
   ``After 2818 days of sitting on the sidelines, George Bush has
finally admitted that there is something wrong with a federal
furlough program that gives 45-day vacations to drug traffickers,''
Bentsen said.
   ``We don't need another review; we need the vice president to
take responsibility for his failure in the fight against drugs and
crime.''

   Thirty-eight academics and
clergymen violated emergency regulations today by urging people to
boycott nationwide municipal elections.
   The first votes were cast Monday, and the state radio said
voters ``showed great interest.''
   The elections for racially segregated municipal councils are
scheduled by law for Oct. 26, but the government passed an
emergency bill allowing people to begin voting on Oct. 10 in a
system called ``prior voting.''
   The government has said the early voting, which lasts until Oct.
22, is designed to make it easier for people to vote in rural areas
and to cut down on the possibility of harassment.
   In several black townships, no candidates are running for
office, and in others only one candidate has sought each post.
Candidates' homes have been fire-bombed and in Soweto, the largest
black township in the country, a candidate was killed.
   The government has billed the municipal elections as a major
move toward extending democracy because for the first time all
races will vote at the same time. The Bureau for Information has
conducted an extensive television, billboard and newspaper
advertising campaign, urging people to participate in the elections.
   The government issued an emergency regulation making it illegal
to call for a boycott of elections, print advertisements or quote
statements carrying that view. But Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
of Cape Town, and the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches, have joined other church leaders in
repeatedly defying the regulation, calling publicly for a boycott
of elections they say will entrench apartheid.
   Tutu, Boesak and other church leaders, black and white, were
among the 38 people signing today's statement urging a boycott.
Others included the leader of an anti-evictions group and eight
faculty members from the University of South Africa, one of the
world's largest correspondence universities.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said Friday that
Tutu, Boesak and other prominent church leaders who violated the
law by calling for boycotts would not be arrested because such an
action would give South Africa bad publicity. But lesser known
clergymen and election opponents have been detained.
   The black majority of 26 million has no vote in Parliament. Less
than 10 percent of blacks voted in the last municipal elections in
1984, which preceded two years of unrest and more than 2,000 deaths.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said today,
``voters throughout the country showed great interest in prior
votes.'' It gave no voting figures.
   ``The election in fact began Monday,'' said Sam Basch, an
elections spokesman for the government's Bureau for Information. He
said that until Oct. 22, voters can go to any municipal office,
show their identification, fill out an application for an early
ballot, mark the ballot there and place it in a ballot box. Then
the voting will stop for four days and resume on Oct. 26, the
official election day.
   Government opponents say the new system is open to abuse, since
there is no secret voting booth, no monitoring of the voting by
delegates from various parties and no immediate counting of the
ballots.

<HEAD>Court Won't Revive Challenge to Way Tisch Became CBS President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
challenge to the way Laurence A. Tisch became president of CBS Inc.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that Tisch's
assumption of power did not amount to a transfer of control
requiring prior approval by the Federal Communications Commission.
   Tisch, chairman of Loews Corp., purchased 24.9 percent of CBS
voting stock in 1986.
   A group called Fairness in Media, long a critic of CBS news
coverage, asked the commission to investigate the results of
Tisch's stock purchase.
   The commission sent a letter of inquiry to CBS in late 1986, and
after receiving a reply ruled that ``the events, to date, do not
constitute a transfer of control'' as defined in the federal
Communications Act of 1934.
   Fairness in Media appealed, and a federal appeals court here
upheld the commission's dismissal of the complaint.
   In the appeal acted on today, Fairness in Media argued that the
commission's investigation ``was a sham that demands judicial
denunciation as arbitrary.''
   The appeal said the purchase of stock in CBS should have
required commission approval as had ABC's acquisition by Cap Cities
and NBC's sale to General Electric.
   The case is Fairness in Media vs. FCC, 88-388.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Age-Bias Lawsuit Against Boeing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
lawsuit charging the Boeing Company with illegal age bias because
it bars pilots from active flight status when they reach 60.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reinstated
the suit.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Boeing in 1984
in federal court in Seattle, charging that Boeing's policy of
removing its pilots from active flight status at age 60 violates
federal law.
   Boeing, one of the world's leading jet manufacturers, defended
the policy as a ``bona fide occupational qualification'' exception
to the law.
   The company rested its case on a regulation of the Federal
Aviation Administration that requires commercial pilots to be under
60.
   A federal judge threw out the suit before trial, ruling there is
almost ``perfect congruity'' between the FAA rule and Boeing's
policy.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the suit in
April, ordering a jury trial.
   Boeing said its pilots perform a variety of flight duties. They
conduct extensive flight operations to test the design and
performance of jets, and also fly passenger flights for commercial
airlines and on corporate jets, the company said.
   Boeing said test flying involves numerous risky procedures, such
as purposely depressurizing aircraft and shutting down engines or
other systems to determine if they will restart in mid-air.
   The FAA in 1959 said pilots must be under 60 on commercial
flights. The policy is based on the belief that after 60 skills
deteriorate, and that exceptions cannot be allowed due to the
difficulty in predicting individual performance or likely
disabilities.
   The 9th Circuit court said the ``critical issue of fact in this
case was the detectability on an individual basis of deterioration
in a Boeing pilot aged 60 or over that might diminish that pilot's
capacity to discharge safely his or her duties.''
   The appeals court added, ``This was an issue for the jury to
decide if the facts were disputed or for the (trial) court if they
were not.''
   The 9th Circuit court said the judge should not dismiss the suit
unless the dismissal were based on the evidence ``no reasonable
jury could have decided that it was practical to test pilots age 60
and over for disabling conditions.''
   The appeals court also noted that before Boeing adopted its age
policy in 1980 pilots over 60 had flown for the company without
incident.
   It also cited a 1985 Supreme Court ruling that said the FAA's
age-60 rule does not automatically cover flight engineers for
commercial airlines.
   The appeals court added that the FAA's rule has never been
tested specifically in court as to whether being under 60 is a bona
fide occupational requirement even for commercial pilots.
   Boeing said the appeals court ruling places the company _ and
possibly commercial airlines _ between two conflicting federal
agency interpretations of federal law. Its appeal said the FAA
believes accurate individual testing of pilots over 60 cannot be
done and the EEOC says it must be done.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to reject
Boeing's appeal.
   Justice Department lawyers noted, for example, that the FAA
itself and the Navy do not force their own pilots to stop flying at
age 60.
   The FAA rule for commercial pilots is evidence in Boeing's favor
but is not the only evidence a jury could weigh, the government
lawyers said.
   The case is Boeing vs. EEOC, 88-53.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Spar Over Foreign Economic Threat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 10 grafs with Bush speech, picking up in 7th
graf pvs, One day; cuts last 5 grafs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush sparred long-distance today over
foreign economic threats, with Dukakis calling for better training
to hold onto jobs now going overseas but Bush saying the Democrat
was just trying to scare people into voting for him.
   Both men were heading today for the West Coast and Thursday
night's debate, with new polls indicating Bush's lead had shrunk to
next to nothing.
   Before leaving, Dukakis also renewed his counterattack against
Bush's repeated charges in connection with Massachusetts' former
prisoner-furlough program, under which an inmate failed to return
from a weekend furlough and attacked a Maryland couple several
months later.
   Dukakis, on NBC's ``Today'' program, noted that inmates have
committed murders while on furlough under a California program
begun while President Reagan was governor and after escaping from a
Houston halfway house Bush helped start.
   ``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes,
that's kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics,'' Dukakis said
of Bush's recent remarks and television ads.
   Later, in Medford, Mass., Dukakis pushed for improved science
and technology education and training as the way to restore U.S.
dominance in manufacturing and marketing of high-tech consumer
goods.
   ``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact
discs to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to
the ayatollah,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, however, in remarks prepared for delivery to Seattle
University Business School students, said Dukakis is ``stoking
fears about foreign influence,'' an apparent reference to Dukakis'
recent comments on foreign investment in the United States.
   ``My opponent needs an issue and he's willing to scare people to
find it, so like the `Know Nothing Party' a century before him he's
turned to fear of foreigners. He's not a Know Nothing _ he knows
better. But perhaps he's a feel nothing candidate, or maybe, with
this later flipflop, he's become a believe nothing candidate,''
Bush said.
   ``I don't think he really believes it. He ran against this
so-called economic nationalism in the primaries,'' Bush said in
remarks released before he left Washington, D.C.
   One day earlier, Bush, hammering at his preferred topic _ crime
_ accused his rival of being more concerned about the fate of
criminals than their victims and vowed a different approach if
elected.
   ``I'm going to bring an attitude to the White House that has
more sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals,''
Bush told an audience Monday at a Knights of Columbus hall in
Trenton, N.J.
   While the vice president courted votes in Trenton's
Italian-American neighborhood, Dukakis traveled to a community
built on the premise that affordable housing should be available to
post-World War II families.
   The Democratic nominee used a visit to a typical family in
Levittown, N.Y., and a speech at the local high school to introduce
his plan that would allow first-time buyers to use up to $10,000 of
their IRAs or pension plans for a down payment.
   Dukakis was meeting with Vietnam War veterans today in
Cambridge, Mass., and delivering an economics speech at Tufts
University in nearby Medford. Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen was campaigning in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, two
key electoral states with 16 and 25 votes, respectively.
   Bush was heading to Seattle where he was giving another
tough-on-crime speech _ white-collar, that is _ to business
students at Seattle University.
   With the presidential debate on Thursday, barring a rainout in
the National League baseball playoff series, the two candidates
were flying to California to prepare for their 90-minute,
prime-time confrontation.
   The nationally broadcast debate will begin at 9 p.m. EDT in the
Pauley Pavilion on the University of California at Los Angeles
campus.
   With Election Day exactly four weeks away, the latest nationwide
poll showed the presidential race too close to call.
   Bush leads Dukakis 50-47 percent in the ABC News-Washington Post
poll conducted Wednesday through Sunday. The survey of 600 likely
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage
points, statistically negating the lead.
   A Los Angeles Times poll released Monday found that Republican
vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle remains a drag on the GOP
ticket. Bush-Quayle leads Dukakis-Bentsen 44-41 percent, but Bush
alone leads his Democratic opponent 48-39 percent.
   The weekend survey of 893 registered voters had a margin of
error of five percentage points.
   But the poll also found that Dukakis' negative rating was higher
than Quayle _ 45 percent to 40 percent.
   Quayle, who campaigned in Michigan and Ohio, gave what he
described as the ``final word'' on his answer to last week's debate
question of what he would do if he was suddenly propelled into the
presidency.
   Quayle said he would make a request to address the nation and
would consult with allies, but other steps would depend on the
situation.
   ``Obviously you do different things under an assassination. The
first thing you do in an assassination _ I would still say a prayer
for myself and the nation _ but the first thing you do is you get
on the phone and call the head of the CIA and see what he thinks it
was,'' Quayle said during a question-and-answer session after an
economics speech in Detroit.
   Quayle said he would have ``contingency plans under different
situations.''
   The GOP candidate was concentrating on voters in Ohio today with
a day-long bus trip through small towns in the western part of the
state.

   Israeli soldiers today
broke up a funeral procession for a Palestinian teen-ager by
jumping aboard a van carrying the body and forcing it to drive to
away.
   About 100 Palestinian mourners responded by throwing rocks and
firebombs at the soldiers, who fired rubber and metal bullets to
disperse the crowd.
   Four Israeli soldiers jumped aboard a red van carrying the body
of Nazem Abu Juda after the Palestinians in the procession began
throwing stones.
   Two army jeeps forced the van, driven by a Palestinian, to
accompany the soldiers to a location the army refused to disclose.
   An army spokesman, who is not identified under regulations, said
the body was taken to halt a large demonstration. He said it would
be returned ``at a time when we know it would not cause
disturbances in Bethlehem.''
   During the disturbance, soldiers shot a 19-year-old man in the
side with a plastic bullet, Arab witnesses said. The army confirmed
one man was wounded. At least five people were arrested.
   The funeral was for Abu Juda, 18, who died early today after
being shot in the head with a plastic bullet Sept. 28 in a clash
with soldiers, according to residents and officials at the nearby
Dheishe Refugee Camp where the boy lived.
   News of the death quickly spread in the camp after Palestinians
keeping a watch outside Abu Juda's room at Jerusalem's Mukassad
Hospital took the body to Dheishe, six miles south of Jerusalem,
minutes after the youth died.
   Mosque loudspeakers called on residents to participate in
funeral services and to pay tribute to the family of the ``martyr.''
   The army responded almost immediately by declaring a curfew on
the camp near Bethlehem, and closing all entrances.
   After the funeral was broken up, hundreds of Palestinians milled
about the streets of Bethlehem, telling merchants to close their
businesses and ordering cars off the roads in a makeshift protest
strike.
   Also today, a 17-year-old Jewish youth killed a Palestinian from
the Gaza Strip's Jabalia refugee camp during a fistfight at a
construction site in the central Israeli town of Lod, police said.
   It said the two started to argue while working on a roof, and
the youth killed Jamil Shiali, 47, with a fist blow to the stomach.
The cause of death was not immediately clear, a police spokesman
said. The 17-year-old's name was not released because he is a minor.
   The deaths of Abu Juda and Shiali brought to 296 the number of
Palestinian killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
10-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation. Six Israelis also
have died.
   Israel's military administration reopened 33 high schools in
Gaza today after a prolonged summer recess, allowing 20,000
students to return to their studies. Schools in the West Bank are
closed until Nov. 15.
   The army also decided to put two officers, a captain and a first
lieutenant, on disciplinary trial for using excessive force after
arresting four Arab stone-throwers in the Gaza Strip's town of
Rafah in July, Israel radio said.
   It said the Palestinians complained that officers forced them to
stand against a wall and beat them, and later threw them on
cactuses. The military police found no evidence to substantiate the
last claim, the radio said.
   The military command said it was checking the report.

   Firefighters have doused three Southern
California fires that blackened 2,425 acres and injured two
firefighters, one of them severely, officials said today.
   Arson, a poorly tended campfire and sparks kicked up by target
practice shots were blamed for the blazes, which were aggravated by
dry desert wind and temperatures topping 100 degrees.
   A Riverside County fire near Winchester blackened 1,800 acres
after a campfire spread to brush Sunday, said California Department
of Forestry spokesman Tim Span.
   About 300 firefighters surrounded the blaze Monday morning, and
it was extinguished at midnight. A female jail inmate digging a
fireline suffered burns over a small area of her body, Span said.
   The last hot spots were mopped up Monday evening on a 425-acre
fire believed to have been intentionally set along a road Sunday
near Hemet, about 85 miles southeast of Los Angeles, CDF
spokeswoman Joanne Evans said.
   CDF Capt. Dave Howard was caught in a firestorm while battling
the blaze and suffered severe burns on about half his body, CDF
spokesman Tim Span said. Howard, one of about 200 firefighters
working the blaze, was listed in critical but stable condition at
Sherman Oaks Community Hospital in Los Angeles, Span said.
   In San Bernardino County near Hesperia, 65 miles northeast of
Los Angeles, a 200-acre brushfire, sparked Sunday by target
practice bullets ricocheting off scrap metal, briefly threatened
homes before it was encircled early Monday and put out later in the
day, CDF spokeswoman Holly Kress said.

   Pope John Paul II today urged a common
political structure for Europe during a speech that was interrupted
when the Rev. Ian Paisley, a militant Protestant leader, shouted
``I renounce you!''
   The address to the European Parliament _ an advisory body to the
12-member European Economic Community _ was the pontiff's main
speech during his four-day trip to northeastern France.
   After a welcome by Lord Plumb, president of the 518-member
Parliament, the pope began speaking but was immediately interrupted
by Paisley, standing about 11 rows from the pope's lecturn at the
back of the wood-paneled room.
   ``I renounce you! I renounce you as the anti-Christ!'' shouted
Paisley, a parliamentarian and the leader of the Irish Protestant
Democratic Unionist Party, the more militant of the two main
Protestant parties in Northern Ireland.
   Other parliamentarians surrounded Paisley, threw papers at him
and tore from his hands a crude orange banner reading, ``John Paul
II, anti-Christ.''
   Plumb called twice for order over Paisley's shouts, then had him
ejected. The room, filled to capacity with parliamentarians, press
and visitors, erupted in applause when deputies and security guards
dragged Paisley away.
   Paisley later told journalists: ``I was hammered. I was beaten
about the ears and the body.''
   It was the second incident in Parliament this week in which
Paisley denounced the pope.
   Paisley has spearheaded opposition to the 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement, which granted the government of Catholic-dominated
Ireland a say in the running of Northern Ireland, a British
province where 60 percent of the population is Protestant.
   The pope has called for peace and reconciliation between
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland without taking a
stand on whether the province should be united with the Irish
Republic.
   The pope smiled slightly at the beginning of the interruption
but otherwise was impassive. John Paul resumed his speech and was
again interrupted, this time by applause.
   As he has throughout the trip, the pontiff endorsed a common
political structure for Europe and called on Europe to ``resume her
role as a beacon in the civilization of the world'' by fighting
pollution, prejudice and secularization.
   ``A common political structure, emanation of the free will of
the European citizens, far from endangering the identity of the
peoples of the (European Economic) Community, will be better suited
to guarantee more fairly the rights, particularly cultural, of all
its regions,'' the pope told the 518-member body.
   The EEC countries have agreed to integrate their economies by
1992 and some Common Market officials have called for development
of a common political organization _ perhaps even a ``United States
of Europe.''
   Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, raised protests
last month from other European governments when she declared that
such an idea was ``utopian'' and would detract from the diversity
of European cultures.
   Besides Britain and France, the EEC members are West Germany,
Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.
   The pope attacked secular humanism and indirectly criticized
communist and religious fundamentalist governments in his address
to the parliamentarians.
   As he has in the past, the pope called for Eastern and Western
Europe to unite and build on their common Christian heritage.
   ``It is my duty to stress vigorously that if the religious and
Christian substratum of this continent should someday be
marginalized in its role of inspiring ethics and in its social
efficacy, it is not only all of the heritage of the European past
that would be denied but a future worthy of European man,'' said
John Paul, who began the speech in English, then turned to French.
   The pontiff was greeted with applause and cries of ``Vive le
Pape!'' as he arrived in a drizzle at the Palace of Europe.
   He began his day by meeting with nuns and priests at the
mountaintop Mont Saint Odile monastery and paying homge do the
patron saint of Alsace-Lorraine. He was then to fly back to the
Vatican from the Alsatian city of Muhouse.
   Soon after his arrival in France on Saturday, the pope pursued
the theme of unity in speeches at the Council of Europe and the
European Court of Human Rights.
   In the opening session of Parliament on Monday, a shouting match
broke out between Niall Andrews, an Irish Catholic conservative,
and Paisley.
   Andrews called Paisley ``an institutional terrorist.'' Paisley
yelled back that he opposed both the pontiff and the Roman Catholic
Church.
   ``I do not believe he is infallible, I do not believe he is the
sole representative of Christ on Earth,'' Paisley shouted.

   Hugh Algernon Percy, the 10th duke of
Northumberland and a descendant of one of Britain's leading
families of nobility, died today, a family spokeswoman said. He was
74.
   The duke died of a suspected heart attack at his London
residence, said the spokeswoman at his ancestral home of Alnwick
Castle in the northern England county of Northumberland. She spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   He was descended from the first earl of Northumberland, Sir
Henry Percy, who won fame for his zeal in border warfare against
the Scottish in the late 14th century. The dukedom was created in
1766.
   Hugh Algernon Percy is succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Alan
Walter Richard Percy, 35. The duke is survived by his wife,
Elizabeth Diana Montagu-Douglas-Scott, two other sons and three
daughters.
   A private funeral will be held later this week, the family
spokeswoman said, followed by memorial services at Alnwick Castle
and Westminster Abbey.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may bar publication or broadcast of a rape victim's
name that reporters get from law enforcement officials.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a weekly Florida
newspaper ordered to pay $97,500 to a rape victim for what the
paper said was inadvertent publication of her name.
   Lawyers for The Florida Star, a newspaper primarily serving the
black community in Jacksonville, said it will be put out of
business if forced to pay the award.
   The Star obtained the rape victim's name from a report posted by
the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department in its press room in October
1983.
   The newspaper said a reporter trainee copied the sheriff's
report, including the victim's name. It was published even though
the newspaper has a policy against identifying rape victims.
   ``There was no factual dispute that the name was published in
error and in violation of the Star's own policy,'' the newspaper
said.
   Publication of the name violated a Florida law that makes it a
misdemeanor to publish or broadcast names or other identifying
information of ``the victim of any sexual offense.''
   The victim of the 1983 assault sued Sheriff Dale Carson and the
Star. She was awarded $2,500 from the sheriff and $97,500 from the
newspaper.
   Lawyers for the Star said a 1986 state appeals court ruling that
upheld the award ignored a series of Supreme Court decisions,
including a 1975 ruling that states may not outlaw the broadcast of
rape victims' names.
   In that case, the victim's name was used in an open court
hearing in which five men pleaded guilty to the attack.
   In that 1975 ruling, the Supreme Court said the Constitution's
First Amendment does not allow states to ``impose sanctions for the
publication of truthful information contained in official court
records open to public inspection.''
   Lawyers for the Florida rape victim, a nurse's assistant with
four children, said there is a distinction between court records
and the report provided by the Jacksonville sheriff.
   The lawyers said the sheriff mistakenly made the victim's name
available and therefore ``the report was not a public record in the
sense that it was available for inspection by the public.''
   The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Times
Herald Printing Co., publisher of The Dallas Times Herald, urged
the Supreme Court to overturn the Florida court ruling.
   The justices, seeking assurances that they have authority to
rule in the case, sent it back to the Florida Supreme Court last
December. The state court then removed any procedural obstacle.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to kill a lawsuit charging the Boeing Company with
illegal age bias because it bars pilots from active flight status
when they reach 60.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reinstated
the suit.
   _ Refused to revive a challenge to the way Laurence A. Tisch
became president of CBS Inc.
   The justices, without comment, let stand ruling that Tisch's
assumption of power did not amount to a transfer of control
requiring prior approval by the Federal Communications Commission.
   _ Agreed to review the award of more than $4 million in fees to
lawyers who won a Kansas City school desegregation lawsuit.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Missouri officials who
want to reduce the amount.
   _ Allowed California officials to block a private club's
beach-front development unless the club vows not to discriminate
against minorities and women.
   The court, citing a lack of a substantial federal issue,
rejected arguments that the anti-bias requirement violates club
members' right to associate with whom they please.
   _ Turned down an appeal by former New York Yankees pitcher Art
Ditmar who was mistakenly identified in a beer commercial as having
surrendered a famous World Series homerun .
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, let stand a ruling
that wrongly being branded a ``gopher ball'' pitcher generally is
not a serious enough matter to sustain a libel lawsuit.
   The rape-victim case is The Florida Star vs. B.J.F., 87-329.

<HEAD>Missouri Parents of Down's Syndrome Child Barred From Suing Doctor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred a Missouri
couple whose child has Down's Syndrome from suing their doctor for
failing to tell them a test would have revealed the disorder prior
to birth.
   The court, without comment, refused to review a ``wrongful
birth'' claim by parents who said they would have chosen abortion
if they knew the child had the disorder.
   Carl and Barbara Wilson sued Dr. Donald Kuenzi of Gladstone, Mo.
   Mrs. Wilson was 36 at the time she conceived and 37 when she
gave birth to her son, Robert, on June 23, 1983.
   Robert was born with Down's Syndrome, a genetic disorder that
causes mental retardation and other defects.
   The Wilsons cited medical evidence that the risk of a child
having the disorder is about one in 1,000 when the mother is in her
20s and about one in 300 when she is 36.
   The Wilsons said Kuenzi failed to inform them the disorder can
be detected by a test known as amniocentesis, in which fluid is
removed from the womb with a needle inserted through the stomach.
   The Wilsons sued the doctor for negligence on their own behalf,
a wrongful birth claim, and on their son's behalf, a wrongful life
claim.
   Missouri enacted a law in 1986 which bars such suits.
   The Missouri Supreme Court ruled last April that the law could
not be applied retroactively to block the Wilsons' suit.
   But the state court dismissed the suit anyway, ruling that
permitting such suits conflicts with the state's policy on personal
injury claims, or torts.
   ``A finding ... that we will not create and will not recognize
either a new tort for wrongful life or for wrongful birth is in our
opinion totally compatible with the policy considerations expressed
by our legislature in attempting to limit the statute of
limitations for malpractice actions,'' the state court said.
   ``In the wrongful-birth action, the right to recovery is based
solely on the woman testifying, long after the fact and when it is
in her financial interest to do so, that she would have chosen to
abort if the physician had but told her of the amniocentesis
test,'' the state court said. ``It would seem that testimony either
more verifiable based upon experience or more verifiable by some
objective standard should be required as the basis for any action
for substantial damages.''
   In the appeal acted on today, the Wilsons said that barring the
suit violated their constitutional rights. The state court did not
address that question specifically.
   The state court did note that wrongful-birth suits have been
permitted in some states. But the Missouri court said those states
have had trouble explaining how a genetic disorder is the result of
``any injury negligently inflicted by the doctor.''
   The Wilsons said shielding doctors from such suits restricts
freedom of choice for women by allowing physicians who oppose
abortion for moral or religious reasons to withhold vital
information from the mother.
   The case is Wilson vs. Kuenzi, 88-362.

<TEXT>
   They attorney for a key defendant in the
$7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery trial told jurors today that his
client knew in advance that the heist would occur, received stolen
money and distributed it to fellow Puerto Rican nationalists.
   Attorney Leonard Weinglass said, however, that his client, Juan
Segarra Palmer, was innocent of the crimes with which he has been
charged because he didn't actually plan the robbery or carry it out.
   The trial of Segarra and four other defendants began today in
U.S. District Court in Hartford. The robbery of $7.1 million from
the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford on Sept. 12, 1983, was the
second largest cash heist in U.S. history.
   Segarra was a leader in a group known as Los Macheteros, which
advocates independence for Puerto Rico, and, Weinglass said, that
is the crux of the government's case.
   ``This is a classic example of how the government deals with a
political enemy,'' Weinglass said in his opening statment to the
jury.
   He said that in an attempt to crush the group, the government
has heaped 17 criminal counts on Segarra. Weinglass conceded that
receiving stolen funds is a crime, but said Segarra hasn't been
charged with that offense.
   The trial is expected to last several months.
   The other four defendants are Carlos Ayes Suarez, Norman Ramirez
Talavera, Roberto Maldonado Rivera and Antonio Comacho Negron.
   The trial of nine other defendants was postponed following a
ruling by U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie earlier this year
tossing out some wiretap evidence collected against them by the
FBI. The government is appealing that ruling.
   Two other defendants pleaded guilty last month.
   The FBI says that a Wells Fargo security guard, who is now
missing, was actually responsible for the theft of the West
Hartford depot on Sept. 12, 1983. Victor M. Gerena, formerly of
Hartford, is accused of tying up co-workers, loading the cash into
a car and fleeing to Cuba, where he is still believed to be hiding
out, the FBI says.
   U.S. Attorney Albert S. Dabrowski told the 12 jurors and six
alternates, who will remain anonymous under Clarie's order, that
Segarra is the key defendant because he was the only one involved
from the beginning, in plotting the robbery, to the end, in the
distribution of stolen funds.
   Dabrowski warned jurors that it would be a complex case.
   ``It took years to perpetrate the offense and it will take
months to prove it,'' Dabrowski said.
   Weinglass said Gerena plotted and singlehandedly pulled off the
robbery after becoming convinced that it was a way to further the
independence of Puerto Rico.
   He said Gerena sought out Segarra because of the defendant's
Harvard education and knowledge of English. Though he didn't plan
the heist, Segarra agreed to accept the money and distribute it
through Los Matcheros, Weinglass said.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Death Sentence of South Carolinian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the death sentence of South Carolina murderer Demetrius
Gathers, convicted of a 1986 killing in a Charleston city park.
   The justices said they will review a South Carolina Supreme
Court ruling that threw out Gathers' sentence last June 6.
   Gathers was convicted of killing Richard Haynes, 32, during a
Sept., 13, 1986, attack in which Haynes was beaten and stabbed.
   The state's highest court upheld Gathers' conviction but ruled
that during the sentencing trial jurors wrongly were told that
Haynes was a religious man.
   The state court said such comments by a prosecutor focused on
the victim's characteristics, which it said is prohibited by a 1987
Supreme Court decision in a Maryland case.
   In it, the justices ruled that a murder's impact on the victim's
family may not be considered when the killer faces a possible death
sentence.
   The justices also said in the 1987 ruling that there is no
justification for letting a life-or-death sentencing decision
``turn on the perception that the victim was a sterling member of
the community rather than someone of questionable character.''
   In Gathers' case, the South Carolina court said the prosecutor
acted unconstitutionally ``by focusing extensively on the personal
characteristics of the victim.''
   The state court said the prosecutor's remarks ``conveyed the
suggestion (Gathers) deserved a death sentence because the victim
was a religous man and a registered voter.''
   In his closing argument, the prosecutor told jurors that among
the things found at the murder scene were various religious items
and a voter registration card belonging to Haynes.
   ``We know from the proof that ... Haynes was a religious person
... (he) believed in this community. He took part,'' the prosecutor
had said.
   In the appeal acted on today, South Carolina Attorney General T.
Travis Medlock argued that the state court misinterpreted the
justices' 1987 decision.
   And he urged the justices to reverse their 1987 ruling, stating,
``The Eighth Amendment (banning cruel and unusual punishment) does
not preclude comments on victim characteristics related to a
crime.''
   The case is South Carolina vs. Gathers, 88-305.

<HEAD>NRA Loses Challenge to Minnesota Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association, for the second
time in two years, lost a Supreme Court challenge to a Minnesota
law that required it to disclose the names of over 20,000 NRA
members.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
Minnesota controversy never should have landed in federal court.
   The justices in 1986 let stand, again without comment, rulings
that the Minnesota Ethics in Government Act does not violate the
free-speech or associational rights of NRA members.
   The law requires lobbying groups to register with the state, and
disclose the names, addresses and places of employment of all those
who contributed more than $50.
   The Minnesota Ethical Practices Board, which enforces the law,
said the NRA is a lobbying group because, in part, it spent
thousands of dollars on mailings attacking former State Attorney
General Warren Spannaus in his 1982 gubernatorial campaign.
   Spannaus lost the Democratic primary to Rudy Perpich, who was
later elected governor.
   U.S. District Judge Miles Lord upheld the law in a May 2, 1984,
ruling. Subsequent NRA appeals to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and the Supreme Court failed.
   The association in late 1984 complied with the law _ supplying
the board with the names, addresses and places of employment of
more than 20,000 Minnesota members to whom letters had been sent in
connection with the 1982 elections.
   Records show that $23,256 was spent in connection with the
mailings.
   In its 1986 appeal, the NRA contended that no group should be
held accountable to government regulation because it communicates
with its members concerning candidates for state office.
   But in the appeal acted on today, the NRA argued that Lord
lacked the authority to rule in the case because the state agency's
lawsuit was based on alleged state law violations.
   The lawsuit had been filed in a state court but the NRA had the
case switched to federal court.
   The case is NRA vs. Minnesota Ethical Practices Board, 88-300.

<TEXT>
   Troops have shot and killed 10 more people
in the capital and a central Burmese town, state radio said today.
   The slayings brought to about 450 the official death toll in
last three weeks of military rule.
   Radio Rangoon also said two more political parties had
registered, bringing to 12 the number of parties formed since
military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18. Saw Maung
has promised to hold a general election soon, but has not set a
date.
   After the coup, soldiers fired on street protesters, and later
on people described as looters and other ``destructive elements.''
Western diplomats believed the actual death toll is much higher.
   The radio said troops Monday night shot and killed four people
looting a warehouse of the film department in Mayangone, a Rangoon
suburb. Also shot and killed Monday were one victim near the
Rangoon River and a man who tried to run away after being
challenged by troops near Kyandaw cemetery.
   On Saturday, troops also shot at a group that was robbing a
village in Minhla, in Magwe Division in central Burma, the radio
said. They killed four robbers, arrested 13, and seized money and
18 spears, it said.
   The radio said the two new parties were the Burma United
Democratic Party and the National Peace and Democracy Party. The
latter is headed by Dawood Jamal, a businessman of Pakistani origin
who was arrested in a well-publicized diplomatic smuggling case in
1978. He was later freed.

   The Swedish Academy will announce the
winner of the Nobel Prize for literature on Thursday.
   The exclusive 18-member academy of Sweden's leading writers and
critics said nothing about the candidates, although it is known to
have focused in recent years on authors from Third World countries.
   The tradition-bound academy, whose members are elected for life,
keeps secret the date of its announcement until a few days before
it happens. It always is made on a Thursday at precisely 1 p.m. (8
a.m. EDT) at the 18th century stock market building where the
academy occupies an upper story.
   Last year the prize went to exiled Soviet poet Joseph Brodsky.
   Other Nobel prizes awarded by the Royal Academy of Sciences will
be announced next week: the medicine prize on Monday, the economic
sciences prize on Tuesday, and the prizes for chemistry and physics
on Wednesday.
   The Nobel Peace Prize went to the United Nations peacekeeping
forces and was announced in the Norwegian capital of Oslo on Sept.
29.
   The Nobel laureates will receive their prizes in ceremonies in
Stockholm and Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old man has become the first hemophiliac
in Britain to be treated with genetically engineered blood protein,
a hospital said Tuesday.
   If the blood-clotting protein proves safe, hemophiliacs may be
able to avoid the risk of getting the deadly AIDS virus or
hepatitis from donated plasma, scientists say.
   The Royal Free Hospital's Hemophilia Center and Hemostasis Unit
said Victor Budgen of London was the first patient in Britain to be
injected with the substitute protein, factor VIII.
   About half a dozen hemophiliacs in the United States and West
Germany have been treated in recent months with genetically
produced factor VIII, he said.
   Budgen ``responded excellently'' to his first injection last
week and will be monitored for the next six months, said Dr. Peter
Kernoff, director of the hemophilia center.
   If the treatment is successful, it will be offered to other
hemophiliacs, Kernoff said.
   ``There is an uncertainty associated with any new drug,''
Kernoff said in a telephone interview. ``I think in this case there
is every reason for optimism because what is produced is virtually
the same as natural factor VIII.''
   Since about 1960, hemophiliacs have gotten factor VIII, which
helps blood clot, from the plasma of unknown donors. But in the
process they have risked contract all,'' he said.
   About 113 hemophilacs in Britain have developed full-blown
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and an estimated 1,100 have
been infected with the AIDS virus because of exposure to
contaminated blood products, Kernoff said.

   Four opposition parties merged Tuesday
as the People's Party and chose a bitter adversary of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi as its leader, news reports said.
   V.P. Singh, who once served as finance and defense minister in
Gandhi's Cabinet, was chosen unanimously to head the new party
after a meeting of opposition leaders in the southern city of
Bangalore.
   Singh was dismissed from the Cabinet in 1987, and newspapers
said he was fired for investigating alleged kickbacks on lucrative
defense contracts. He later was dismissed from Gandhi's Congress
Party.
   ``I am happy and proud that a new baby has been born,'' S.R.
Bommai, chief minister of the southern Karnataka state told members
of the new party. ``It is a very, very healthy baby.''
   The new party is made up of the old People's Party, as well as
the Lok Dal, Jan Morcha and the Socialist Congress parties.
   On May 1, 1977, four regional groups merged to become the
People's Party. Later that year, the party ousted the ruling
Congress Party and governed India for 29 months.
   Gandhi must call elections before January 1990.

   The Labor Department awarded $2 million in
emergency grants Tuesday to programs in four states for retraining
migrant and seasonal farm workers whose jobs were lost to the
effects of the summer drought.
   The funds are from a special $5 million account established
under the Job Training Partnership Act when it became clear that
the dry summer weather would have a devastating effect on fall
harvest employment.
   ``These workers are caught in an adverse situation beyond their
control,'' said Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin. ``We want to
provide them with the necessary skills training so they can quickly
return to being productive.''
   Five areas of Texas will get a total of $1.5 million to assist
some 1,100 migrant workers returning to the state, their home in
the winter, with little or no income because of the effects of the
drought on crops. The five areas are Rural Costal Bend, Middle Rio
Grand, South Texas, Cameron County and Hidalgo and Wallacy Counties.
   Oregon will get $824,500 to help up to 360 of some 12,000
surplus farm workers because water shortages in the eastern part of
the state decimated sugar beet, onion, potato and bean crops.
   The Rural Alabama Development Corp. was awarded $200,000 to help
up to 155 seasonal farm workers. The money will go to providing
them with child care, health and medical services and, in some
cases emergency shelter, clothing and food while they are in
on-the-job training programs.
   Indiana's Department of Human Services will receive $169,760 to
finance, among other things, a food pantry for farm worker families
in Central Indiana through offices in Kokomo, Anderson and South
Bend. Most of the money will be aimed at vocational skill training
for migrant and seasonal workers wanting to switch to full-time
employment.
   Previous grants totaling $1.8 million from the emergency drought
job-training fund job training were awarded last month to JTPA
agencies in Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, South Dakota
and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Government Resigns After Shake-Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with government resigning. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government resigned
today, state-run media reported, one day after a shake-up led the
nation's premier and his deputy to step down.
   The CTK news agency said the resignation of the entire
government, a formality following Premier Lubomir Strougal's
resignation, was announced in a letter to President Gustav Husak.
Husak accepted the resignation and thanked the government for its
work, CTK said.
   Strougal, a 63-year-old economics expert believed to have been
Europe's longest-serving premier, resigned Monday, the first day of
a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee dealing with
personnel and ideology questions.
   He also vacated his seat on the ruling Politburo.
   His deputy in the federal government, Peter Colotka, resigned as
premier of the Slovak Socialist Republic, one of the nation's two
republics, and as a member of the Politburo.
   In a speech to the Central Committee on Monday, Jan Fojtik, the
Communist Party's chief ideologist, made clear that the Prague
leadership was opposed to radical political and economic changes
similar to those under way in the Soviet Union.
   According to the text of his speech carried by CTK, Fojtik came
out in favor of cautious reform and underscored the leading role of
the party.
   ``One of the most fundamental lessons of the past is that in
looking for and pursuing new ways of development, we must under no
circumstances permit the weakening of the leading role of the
Communist Party,'' Fojtik said.
   Fojtik rejected criticism of Czechosovakia's hard-line approach
to dissident movements.
   ``We must not close our eyes to any of the risks of reform,''
said the ideologist. ``Superficial journalism, and here we are not
speaking only about our own authors, makes light of some (of these
problems) or passes them over in silence altogether while
dramatizing others.''
   The shake-up follows similar government reorganizations in the
Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland, as well as unrest in Yugoslavia.
   But a liberalization of political life in Czechoslovakia seemed
unlikely.
   In his speech to the Central Committee, party chief Milos Jakes
made it clear that unlike in neighboring Hungary, independent human
rights, ecological and other groups would not be allowed to operate.
   He warned that formation and operation of ``anti-Socialist
political structures'' will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted.
   While considered a hardliner supporting the crackdown on dissent
and other harsh policies in earlier years, Strougal was most
recently known as a chief advocate of economic and social reforms
initiated in the Soviet Union.
   However, his proposals were amended and watered down by a
leadership that has so far been reluctant to adopt all the
innovative changes that have become a trademark of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The names of Strougal, Colotka and Foreign Minister Bohuslav
Chnoupek also came up in a corruption scandal last year.
   Jakes, who become party chief in December, has said the fight
against corruption would be among his priorities.
   There have long been rumors about top-level changes in
Czechoslovakia, and Jakes and other officials have indicated for
some time that younger people would be promoted to senior positions.
   It was believed that Strougal's departure and other changes
affecting the party and government hierarchy, were discussed and
endorsed by a Politburo meeting last week.
   In interviews with Western newspapers earlier this year,
Strougal indicated that he was considering leaving the government
he took over 16 months after Soviet tanks crushed the Czechoslovak
reform movement known as ``Prague Spring.''
   ``Restructuring affects all spheres of social life,'' Strougal
said in a speech before workers in April this year. ``It is not
possible to relate it only to the economy, because even the need
for higher output and quality is not limited to the production
sphere alone.
   ``We have embarked on a difficult but indispensable path because
continuing the way we went so far would mean allowing stagnation
with all ensuing consequences,'' he said.

<HEAD>Students Demand Legalization of Banned Association</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of students at universities
nationwide today rallied to demand legalization of the outlawed
Independent Students' Association and Solidarity.
   Demonstrations were held at about 30 universities and colleges
in major cities throughout Poland, said Piotr Sosnowski, an
association spokesman in Gdansk.
   The government said it ``disapproved'' of the demonstrations and
accused students of trying to ``torpedo'' upcoming talks between
authorities and opposition leaders.
   The talks were promised by the government after a series of
pro-Solidarity strikes ended in August. They are expected this
month, but no date has been set.
   About 1,500 students gathered at noon at Warsaw University. They
raised banners for their organization and for the Solidarity trade
union federation and chanted the names of the two banned groups.
   Earlier, members of the officially recognized Polish Students
Association distributed leaflets saying one students' organization
could not represent all students.
   Supporters of the other student group burned the leaflets and
said the official organization was blocking their efforts to gain
legalization.
   Polish authorities legally registered the Independent Students'
Association in Feb. 1981, but it was banned shortly after the
martial law crackdown in Dec. 1981. Solidarity was also banned then.
   The Warsaw University students are demanding amendments to the
law on higher education to give them more autonomy; lifting of
obligatory courses in the Russian language; and reform of the
required military training course.
   Professor Grzegorz Bialkowski, the rector of Warsaw University,
which has the most politically active student body in Poland, said
in an interview last week that he favors legalization of the
Independent Students' Association because it would make it easier
to negotiate with the students. ``They are not criminals and they
should be allowed to be active,'' he said.
   The government and the state-run press have criticized the
student demonstrations, saying they could hinder agreement between
the authorities and the opposition.
   ``We treat students' demonstrations as excesses which are the
symtom of bad intentions of the organizers and political immaturity
of particpants,'' government spokesman Jerzy Urban said at his
weekly news conference today.
   ``Those demonstrations are being organized right before the
debates of the round table. So they are adventurous behavior aimed
against national accord, and in fact an attempt to torpedo the
round table and show arrogance to all the participants,'' Urban
said.
   A week ago, a small group of Warsaw University students began a
daily picket in front of the barracks where the military training
course is held, and more than than 300 have joined the protest,
said Mariusz Kaminski, one of the organizers.
   The banned student group also set up a human rights monitoring
group. Students who were detained or beaten at an alternative
demonstration on Friday were urged to contact the group.
   The demonstrators at Warsaw University dispersed peacefully
after about 45 minutes. Organizers had asked the students not to
continue the rally on the streets outside the university grounds.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of demonstrators angry with the
federal government's response to the AIDS crisis effectively shut
down the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters today.
   Authorities arrested at least 50 protesters. Demonstration
leaders said they were aiming for 300 arrests by early afternoon
but it appeared they would not meet their goal.
   Scores of federal employees were stranded outside the sprawling
17-story building when Montgomery County police stopped letting
workers inside at 7:30 a.m.
   The FDA had planned for its workforce of 2,000 _ out of 4,500
federal employes who work in the building _ to arrive early and use
a rear entrance. But a small band of demonstrators broke off from
the main body of protesters at the building's main entrance and
blocked the other three entrances.
   Rather than trying to separate demonstrators from building
employees, police told arriving workers the building was closed.
Two hours later, police officers at intersections near the building
approached workers and told them the building was closed.
   Many employees, caught offguard when police closed the building,
lined up at pay phones nearby to call their co-workers inside and
find out what to do.
   One unidentified woman said she was told that only six of 30
people in her office had made it in. Another person said he was
told that just four of his 20 or so co-workers had arrived.
   Yet, FDA spokesman Brad Stone said, ``We're just trying to get
through the workday as usual. ... People seem to be taking it in
stride and things are going pretty routinely.''
   Stone said he had walked through several floors occupied by the
FDA and estimated that 75 percent of the FDA workforce was on the
job.
   ``It sure looks more occupied than when there is a bad snow
day,'' he added.
   The arrest procedure was simple. Groups of a half-dozen or so
protesters would sit down outside the main entrance at the feet of
a line of police officers. When the officers actually handling the
arrests completed processing one batch of arrestees, they would
return to the entrance and make more arrests.
   Others of the demonstrators circled in front of the building's
entrances, chanting, ``Act up; fight back; fight AIDS'' and ``Test
drugs, not people.''
   Leaders of the protest describe the FDA's response to the AIDS
crisis as criminally inadequate.
   On Monday, a small contingent of police watched as a series of
speakers outside the headquarters of the Health and Human Services
Department ridiculed the Reagan administration, saying it has done
little to help AIDS victims or support research toward a cure.
Protesters also castigated news organizations, saying they have not
paid enough attention to the disease.
   Monday's rally was organized as a mock trial with speaker after
speaker reading off a list of ``charges'' against the
administration as a ``judge'' stood by nodding affirmatively at
each count.
   ``Guilty, guilty, guilty,'' the crowd chanted as various charges
were leveled.
   A major focus of the rally was to press for wide access to
experimental drugs for people suffering from AIDS, or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   As of Sept. 26, AIDS had been diagnosed in 74,447 Americans,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Of those, the
CDC says, 41,925 have died.

   An independent electric power generator said
Tuesday it would help finance 385 square miles of forests in
Guatemala to offset the carbon dioxide emissions expected from a
Connecticut generating plant over the next 40 years.
   Carbon dioxide is the principal gas responsible for the expected
``greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth. It is an inevitable
byproduct of combustion of all fossil fuels.
   Applied Energy Services Inc. of Arlington, Va., said it would
give $2 million to a project aimed at planting almost 52 million
trees in plantations and small farmer woodlots.
   The Peace Corps, the U.S. Agency for International Development,
CARE and the government of Guatemala also will contribute cash or
services to the project.
   Applied Energy Services is building a coal-fired 180-megawatt
plant at Uncasville, Conn., which will sell electricity under
contract to Connecticut Light & Power Co. when it goes into service
in about a year.
   Though a mature forest neither absorbs nor releases carbon
dioxide on balance, the widespread destruction of tropical forests
and burning of their wood probably accounts for about a fifth of
all releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, said Gus Speth,
president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based
environmental research organization which helped Applied Energy
Services organize the reforestation project.
   A growing forest, on the other hand, absorbs large amounts of
carbon dioxide in producing woody tissue.
   Applied Energy Services said it estimated that two square miles
of forest would be needed to offset each megawatt of capacity
during the life of the project. The project area in Guatemala is
slightly larger than the 360 square miles this rule of thumb would
require.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Sex Discrimination Case Against Cleveland
Plain Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
16-year-old sex discrimination case against the Cleveland Plain
Dealer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the lawsuit because of delays by the Cleveland Newspaper Guild and
others in pursuing the case.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case. But the votes of at least four justices are
required to grant such review.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 10-5 ruling last
February, said it would be unfair to permit the newspaper to be
sued after such a long delay.
   The appeals court also rejected arguments by the union and the
women who accused the Plain Dealer of bias that the newspaper had
``unclean hands'' because it contributed to the delays.
   The appeals court said that while throwing out such a civil
rights suit is an extreme measure it is necessary ``when the
prejudice to the defendant can be avoided in no other way.''
   The case began in April 1972 when the newspaper guild, on behalf
of its female members, filed a charge with the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   The complaint accused the newspaper of sex discrimination in its
handling of merit pay, promotions and assignments and in other
employment practices.
   Four years passed before the EEOC began its investigation.
Another six years elapsed before the union and its members sued the
Plain Dealer in federal court.
   In 1976, the Plain Dealer refused to surrender personnel records
sought by the federal agency. In 1980, the newspaper said the
documents no longer were available.
   The 6th Circuit court said the newspaper's lack of cooperation
with the commission's investigation does not explain the initial
four-year delay in launching the probe.
   The appeals court noted that the trial judge who dismissed the
suit initially had found that ``the EEOC's notice to defendant to
retain personnel records was too ambiguous to serve as a valid
command.''
   The case is Cleveland Newspaper Guild vs. Plain Dealer, 87-1864.

   A gunman killed a local crime boss
in a barber shop Tuesday, pumping seven bullets into him as he sat
for a shave, police said.
   The gunman and a lookout, both wearing helmets that covered
their faces, sped away on a high-powered motorcycle, witnesses said.
   Killed was Demetrio Serraino, 48, described as a boss of the
'ndrangheta, the Mafia-like crime syndicate in Calabria, the region
in the toe of the Italian boot.
   Serraino, who had an arrest record for criminal association and
extortion, died en route to a hospital, police said. The barber was
unhurt.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the killing was the 42nd
homicide in the city of Reggio Calabria this year, many of them
linked to a war between rival criminal gangs.
   A cousin of Serraino was killed in 1986 in his hospital room by
gunmen.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a case
involving damage suits brought against the owners of the Italian
cruise ship Achille Lauro as a result of a 1985 PLO hijacking in
which American passenger Leon Klinghoffer was killed.
   The question brought before the court is whether American courts
must respect a provision printed on the line's passenger tickets
that require ``any controversy'' to be heard before courts in
Naples.
   Klinghoffer, 69, of New York, traveling with his wife Marilyn,
was killed by the four pirates who took over the ship, firing
Soviet-made submachine guns and brandishing hand grenades and other
explosives. The man, who was Jewish, had been paralyzed on the
right side by a stroke several years earlier and was in a
wheelchair.
   The U.S. District Court in New York denied a motion by the Lauro
Line in 1987 to dismiss all the damage suits for lack of authority
because of the provision on the ticket. The U.S. Court of Appeals
dismissed the ship line's appeal.
   Lauro Lines, saying that five courts of appeals have issued
conflicting opinions on a clause on which ``forum'' can hear a
case, asked the high court to decide.

   Hank Williams Jr., still reigning as
Nashville's top entertainer, celebrated twin honors from the
Country Music Association with word that he'll release as a duet a
newfound recording made by his legendary father.
   Through modern technology, Williams, 39, will be able to join
his late dad on the recording, to be released in February. The
song, ``There's a Tear in My Beer,'' was cut by Williams Sr. in
1952, less than a year before he died.
   ``It's an absolute treasure,'' Williams said Monday night. ``I
get chills playing it.''
   Vocals by the younger Williams will be added to the original
track.
   Hank Williams Sr. was a country music pioneer with hits like
``Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.''
   ``I hope in my best day I can sing as good as he did,'' Williams
said as the Country Music Association gave him its vote of
confidence at the 22nd awards Monday night.
   Williams was named entertainer of the year for the second time
in a row and also won the trophy for best album, ``Born to Boogie.''
   The only other double winner was K.T. Oslin, who was voted
female vocalist of the year and won best song for her poignant
``80's Ladies.''
   Williams explained that he tries to reach the common man with
his turbocharged blend of country, rock 'n' roll and blues.
   ``I try to sing my songs for everyday folks and it all worked
out,'' he said. ``I try to tear 'em up before I get off the stage.''
   Oslin has been singing country music professionally for just two
years after minor roles on Broadway and making television
commercials for items such as denture products.
   ``I have electric light switches where I used to have chains,''
she said about the change in her life since 1986.
   She said the two awards will mean ``more bucks, honey, more
bucks.''
   Randy Travis, whose album ``Always & Forever'' has sold 3
million copies, was voted male vocalist of the year for the second
straight time.
   His award met with the approval of Roy Acuff, the 85-year-old
``king of country music,'' who was wearing a jacket backstage that
said ``Randy Travis, Back to Country'' on it.
   The Judds, a mother-daughter duet, were voted No. 1 duo after
winning group of the year three straight years. They were placed in
the duo category this year under a rules change.
   Kathy Mattea's ``18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' was voted No. 1
single record. The four-piece vocal band Highway 101 won their
first CMA award, group of the year.
   Ricky Van Shelton won the Horizon Award for a promising newcomer
and veteran guitarist Chet Atkins was voted No. 1 instrumentalist
for the ninth time. The vocal event, a new award given to two or
more singers who do not normally perform together, went to Dolly
Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris for their ``Trio'' album.
   Country queen Loretta Lynn and cowboy singer Roy Rogers were
voted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

   Michael Dukakis boosted economic
nationalism while tossing barbs at his Republican opponents
Tuesday, promising as president to restore American leadership in
science and technology and translate that into dominance of global
markets.
   Dukakis said that he and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen
would be aggressive advocates for U.S. companies and workers while
Republican George Bush was ``satisfied with today and complacent
about tomorrow.''
   Dukakis delighted the partisan crowd at Tufts University with
new salvos at the GOP ticket, saying the ``Republican campaign song
seems to be, `Don't Worry; Be Happy,''' a tune played at a recent
Bush event.
   ``I want us to be happy, but I also want us to be concerned,''
Dukakis said. Then, lashing out at the bottom half of the
Republican ticket, he added: ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that
if he ever had to fill in for George Bush, America could get by on
a right wing and a prayer.''
   Dukakis ticked off a six-point plan aimed at improving U.S.
science teaching and technology as well as product development. And
he spoke of the ``new economic patriotism'' that has become a
staple of his attempt to win support from blue-collar workers and
middle class voters concerned about their jobs and effects of the
federal budget and trade deficits.
   ``We have a choice,'' Dukakis said. ``Will we keep running in
place or will we forge ahead? Will the future belong to our
competitors, or to us? Will we sell out more and more of our land
and our factories and our banks, or will we take charge of our
future?''
   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in the
world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and
produce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,'' he
said.
   Bush, meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery to college
students in Seattle, accused Dukakis of ``protectionist
demagoguery'' in his criticism of foreign ownership of U.S.
businesses.
   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people
to find it,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, on another subject, also appeared on national
television to denounce what he called the ``crass and cynical''
campaign tactics of Bush in connection with attacks on Dukakis as
soft on crime. In addition, he attended a breakfast with Vietnam
veterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor and
spent several hours preparing for his second and final debate with
Bush Thursday night in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis was flying to California later Tuesday.
   At Tufts University, about two dozen Bush supporters gathered
outside and chanted ``Bush '88'' as Dukakis arrived and left.
   Inside, Dukakis declared, ``If we can build the greatest
spaceship the world has ever seen, then we ought to be able to
build the televisions and the VCRs that compete and that win in
foreign markets.''
   The six points discussed by Dukakis, most of them proposals he
has touched on earlier in the campaign, include:
   _Having the National Science Foundation issue annual,
state-by-state reports on the quality of science education.
   _Establishing seminars to help science instructors improve their
teaching.
   _Calling on scientists and engineers, including retirees, to
teach classes.
   _Persuading industry to set up worksite technology training and
retraining centers.
   _A nationwide network of centers of excellence modeled after
state programs designed to foster research and new product
development.
   _Cooperation between U.S. companies in advanced technologies
such as superconductivity and consumer electronics.
   ``We need a commander in chief who stands up and fights for
American companies, American products and American jobs,'' said
Dukakis, who said Bentsen would be his top deputy in the trade war.
``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact discs
to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to the
ayatollah.''
   Dukakis also joked about his ``October surprise,'' a speech last
week in which he warned against growing foreign investment in the
United States only to find out after the speech that the company at
which he sounded the warning was owned by an Italian firm.
   ``I'm not against foreign ownership,'' Dukakis said after making
light of his mistake. ``I'm against the policies that make us
dependent. I'm against a fire sale of America.''
   During the morning telvision appearance Dukakis appeared upbeat
about the debate and repeated his contention that Bush was
exploiting a tragedy involving a Massachusetts furlough program for
political gain because of Bush's own failure as the Reagan
administration's point man on crime and drugs.
   Speaking on NBC's ``Today'' program, he denounced Bush for
repeatedly detailing the violent assault of a Maryland couple by a
murderer who escaped while on a Massachusetts furlough.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' said Dukakis,
who said similar tragedies have occurred in the federal furlough

<HEAD>Tories Open Convention in Resort Overshadowed by Tight Security</HEAD>

   The Conservative Party opened its
convention Tuesday, shadowed by massive security and memories of an
Irish Republican Army attempt to kill Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher in the same town four years ago.
   The four-day annual convention began on a sour note as delegates
booed the socialist mayor of Brighton for implying in her welcoming
speech that the Tories' free-market doctrines were making Britons
greedy and uncaring.
   Defense Secretary George Younger pledged to retain Britain's
independent nuclear deterrent by deploying U.S.-made Trident
sea-launched missiles in the 1990s.
   He ridiculed the opposition Labor Party's commitment to
unilateral nuclear disarmament, reaffirmed at Labor's convention
last week, saying it would ``leave us totally vulnerable to nuclear
attack.''
   Younger said there was no sign that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had slowed the pace of military buildup, adding: ``By all
means let us welcome the new atmosphere and the smile of Mr.
Gorbachev, but let us recognize the military realities that lie
behind that smile.''
   The convention was back in Brighton for the first time since
1984, when an IRA bomb planted in Mrs. Thatcher's hotel killed five
people. The prime minister narrowly escaped harm.
   Before joining the convention, Mrs. Thatcher attended a private
memorial service at the nearby Church of St. Paul's for the bombing
victims and unveiled a plaque inscribed, ``They paid the price of
freedom.''
   Memories of the bombing surged back anew when former party
chairman Norman Tebbit arrived on the conference floor pushing a
wheelchair carrying his wife Margaret, who was paralyzed for life
in the explosion.
   Delegates stood and cheered the couple.
   More than 1,500 police officers were drafted into the normally
staid resort town on the southern coast in the biggest security
operation ever mounted for a British political conference.
   Civil overflights were banned, a Royal Navy destroyer patrolled
the shore and delegates were forced to line up early outside the
conference hall and endure rigorous security checks.
   The bomb damage to the Grand Hotel has been repaired, and as
Mrs. Thatcher checked in Monday night she declared that her
presence there was a gesture of non-surrender to terrorism.
   The IRA issued a statement expressing delight at ``the hysteria
and the expense surrounding the security of Mrs. Thatcher and the
Tories at their Brighton conference.''
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to rid
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who turns 63 Thursday, returned to Brighton with
her dominance of British politics looking even more secure than
four years ago.
   Elected in 1979 and 16 months into her third successive
five-year term, she is the longest continuously serving British
prime minister this century.
   Despite rising inflation and interest rates and a record trade
deficit, the Conservatives arrived in Brighton with a healthy
five-point lead in polls over the opposition Labor Party.
   The proceedings opened with greetings from Mayor Pat Hawkes, a
Laborite, who was booed when she urged the Tories not to forget the
needy in ``an orgy of getting and spending.''
   ``As you walk around in Brighton,'' she declared to mounting
heckling, ``look behind the facade of wealth and opulence and think
about the people over whom the government rules _ not just the
haves but the have-nots.''
   A theme of this year's conference is the Tories' need to restore
their image as a party that cares for the underdog, after years of
budget-slashing and union-curbing aimed at shaking Britain out of
its economic malaise.
   Many Tories feel that with unemployment finally falling, income
tax slashed and the economy booming, they should turn to social
issues.
   Michael Heseltine, a former Cabinet minister tipped as a
possible Thatcher heir, urged the government to spend the cash from
the ``richer Britain'' it had created on inner cities and the
environment.
   ``We want a fair distribution of ... wealth between the
privileged and the less privileged _ a generous society,''
Heseltine told a convention meeting.

   A philosophy student whose conscience
apparently bothered him was arrested after he balked at keeping the
booty from a shoe store robbery, police said.
   John P. Breuker, a 20-year-old part-time student at Calvin
College, was released Monday on $500 bond after being charged with
attempted armed robbery.
   Jane Kelm, manager of Payless Shoesource in the Grand Rapids
suburb, said a robber Saturday night handed her a note that said:
   ``Don't look at me. If you do, I'll kill you. I have a gun.
Calmly, quietly open the drawer and put all the bills in (the) bag.
The gun is ready and it's aimed at you. Just do everything the way
I want it and don't be stupid. Remember, don't look at me.''
   Kelm said she gave the thief an unspecified amount of money and
he fled.
   Police say Breuker called authorities about four hours later and
said he would drop off the money at a gas station.
   ``We're thinking he had second thoughts and decided to give the
money back with the idea that he'd get out of it,'' said Police
Chief Terry Tobias.
   Ryan Rohloff, assistant manager at the gas station, said he was
working the night shift when a man entered and telephoned police.
   ``It was a funny story, the old friend-of-a-friend story,''
Rohloff said. ``He said a friend robbed a business and that he
ended up with the money and that the friend asked him to turn it in
anonymously.''
   Rohloff said the man hung up the phone and asked him to hold the
money until police arrived.
   ``He said, `I just got to leave. You do what you have to do. I
can't stay any longer,''' Rohloff said. ``He seemed nervous. ...
His conscience was just eating him up.''
   The man drove off, and Rohloff said he copied down the car's
license number and gave it to police. A state trooper arrested the
suspect several minutes later, Tobias said.
   Breuker faces an Oct. 24 preliminary hearing.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Industry Challenges to Environmental Rules on
Smokestacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected industry
challenges to federal environmental rules governing the use of high
smokestacks to disperse air pollution.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that
strengthens clean air regulations by limiting the use of
smokestacks as a substitute for other pollution controls.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled in January that the
Environmental Protection Agency validly adopted the regulations in
1985.
   The rules were prompted in large measure by amendments to the
Clean Air Act, passed by Congress in 1977.
   The amendments were aimed at resolving disputes over the extent
to which industries may meet their required contribution to local
clean-air goals by dispersing pollution rather than by reducing
emissions.
   Building taller stacks, the leading technique of dispersal,
generally is cheaper than cutting emissions. But environmentalists
say that while dispersing the pollution may provide cleaner air in
the vicinity of plants and factories, it adds to the overall
pollution in the atmosphere.
   The rules upheld by the appeals court limit the extent to which
reduction in ground-level pollution near the plants counts toward a
company's compliance with national clean-air standards.
   There are several components to the regulations, including the
height of the stacks and when they were put in place. Generally,
the government permits higher stacks if they were built or approved
prior to the adoption of tighter regulations.
   Coal producers, utility companies and the United Mine Workers of
America challenged the rules.
   They said the Environmental Protection Agency failed to give
them adequate opportunity to be heard before approving regulations
that were far more stringent than those originally proposed by the
agency.
   The appeals court said, ``The EPA can obviously promulgate a
final regulation that differs in some respects from its proposed
regulation. We think the agency's ultimate choice (in 1985)
qualifies _ if barely _ as a logical outgrowth of the original
proposal.''
   The appeals court also rejected industry arguments that the
agency illegally was enforcing new rules retroactively.
   Environmental groups had asked the appeals court to compel the
EPA to adopt even tougher regulations.
   The appeals court ruled in favor of the environmentalists on
some points and against them on others, but the environmentalists
did not appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The cases are Alabama Power Co. vs. Thomas, 87-2068; Ohio Power
Co. vs. Thomas, 88-60; and National Coal Association vs. NRDC,
88-61.

<HEAD>Court Lets Ruling Stand That Migrant Workers Protected by Law in
Wisconsin Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that migrant workers who harvest cucumbers for pickling are
protected by a federal law requiring fair treatment of employees.
   The court rejected an appeal by a Wisconsin farm-owning couple
who said the migrants are ``independent contractors'' not covered
by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case. But
the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such
review.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December ruled
against Michael and Marilyn Lauritzen, owners of a farm near
Waupaca, Wis.
   The appeals court said the pickers _ like other migrant workers
_ are employees under the federal law. It ruled that the Lauritzens
are not entitled to a full trial in the case.
   The migrants ``depend on the (Lauritzens') land, crops,
agricultural expertise, equipment and marketing skills,'' the
appeals court said. ``They are the defendants' employees.''
   But the 7th Circuit court said that does not mean the Lauritzens
must shoulder an unfair economic burden.
   The couple ``need only think of the proceeds paid to the pickle
pickers as wages, keep the necessary records and make sure they
abide by the protections that the act accords to working
children,'' the appeals court said.
   The U.S. Labor Department sued the Lauritzens to force them to
keep records of the names, ages and work hours of the migrants; to
require them to determine whether young children were working in
the fields; and to guarantee payment of the minimimum wage.
   Allegations that the farm owners were not paying the minimum
wage later were dropped.
   The migrants usually work in the fields from July through
September. While the crop is often referred to as pickles, it
actually is a type of cucumber suitable for pickling.
   The Lauritzens subdivide their property into family plots, and
the migrant family decides which members will pick the pickles. The
migrants' income is determined in part by their ability to judge
the pickles' size, color and freshness so as to harvest the more
valuable pickles.
   The workers also can increase their income by caring for the
plants and pickles on their plot.
   But the 7th Circuit court said those factors do not mean the
workers are anything other than employees.
   The Lauritzens ``did not effectively relinquish control of the
harvest to the migrants,'' the appeals court said.
   And, the appeals court added, the need for some skill in
harvesting pickles does not make the migrants independent
contractors.
   ``Skills are not the monoply of independent contractors. We do
not find that this level of skill sets the pickle harvester apart
from the harvester of other crops,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Lauritzen vs. Brock, 87-1853.

<HEAD>Reagan Meets Sihanouk; Discusses Strife in Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk voiced support today for any move to get Pol Pot and other
leaders of the Khmer Rouge exiled from the war-torn Southeast Asian
nation.
   Following a brief meeting at the White House with President
Reagan, Sihanouk was asked by reporters to comment on a report
saying many Asian officials see such an exile as a key element to a
political settlement in Cambodia, now known formally as Kampuchea.
   The prince, who will travel to the United Nations after meetings
with U.S. officials here, said, ``When I met with the Chinese
leadership in Peking, before coming to Europe and to America, I did
not get from China any indication that China would like to accept a
Pol Pot in exile.''
   But Sihanouk, who heads a small anti-communist faction known as
the National Party of Sihanouk, added that ``I think that it is
necessary to give the world some guarantee about the Khmer Rouge in
the future.''
   ``I think the ones who are responsible for the genocide of the
Cambodian people'' in the 1970s ``must not continue to lead the
Khmer Rouge movement and they must go into exile if possible,'' he
said.
   The New York Times, in a story published in today's editions,
said many diplomats view China as a likely haven for Pol Pot and
other figures of the Khmer Rouge, the communist regime that Pol Pot
headed before being ousted during the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
   During his daily news briefing, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said that Reagan told Sihanouk that he ``supported
(Sihanouk's) efforts to establish a reconciliation government in
Cambodia.''
   ``He said our policy rests on two elements, a complete
Vietnamese withdrawal and no return to power of the Khmer Rouge,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said that Reagan ``told the prince that the United States is
prepared to join an international conference to ratify any solution
worked out by the parties and, further, that we believe an
international presence in Camobodia is needed.''
   The Vietnamese announced months ago that they planned to pull as
many as 50,000 troops out of Cambodia by the end of this year.
   But Sihanouk said today that the withdrawal is not progressing
satisfactorily.
   He said ``the puppet regime'' installed by Hanoi to run
Cambodia's affairs refuses ``to give a precise timetable'' for the
withdrawal of the approximately 120,000 Vietnamese forces from the
country.

   A jobless man who rolled his
wheelchair 13 miles to pick up food stamps after he was unable to
get a ride from a company that provides transportation for the
disabled has been offered a job by that firm.
   Raymond Vickery of Jacksonville was offered work taking
telephone calls for the private Greater Jacksonville Transportation
Co., operator of the Dial-A-Ride Transportation service, company
President S. L. Steinman said Monday.
   ``It looks like there may be a happy ending to this story,'' he
said.
   The authority operates Dial-A-Ride Transportation, which
provides rides at a cost for people with disabilities.
   Vickery, a paraplegic since an automobile accident in 1964,
wheeled himself Oct. 5 from his home in Mayport to the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services office on
Jacksonville's south side, a 5{-hour journey.
   Vickery said he had been turned down seven times in the last
three months by DART.
   Officials of the public Jacksonville Transportation Authority
and Greater Jacksonville Transportation Co., which was hired by the
public agency to run DART, said some requests are turned down
because of limited resources.
   Vickery, who lives with his wife and 6-year-old daughter, said
he wasn't seeking publicity when he made the trip.

<HEAD>National Program Uses Newspapers to Teach Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national program designed to teach parents
ways to use newspapers to help their young children develop reading
and communications skills was kicked off Tuesday at a local
elementary school.
   The program, called ``Family Focus: Reading and Learning
Together,'' is aimed at parents with children in grades 1 through
3. Local programs are to be organized by schools and parent-teacher
associations.
   ``The newspaper is the reading material we use most frequently
in this country,'' said Patricia S. Koppman, president of the
International Reading Association, told a group of educators and
parents at the Gage-Eckington Elementary School.
   With newspapers as an inexpensive and readily available
resource, parents can help children ``have fun with words,'' said
Manya S. Ungar, president of the National Congress of Parents and
Teachers, another program sponsor.
   Suggestions for parents range from helping children read
headlines to having youngsters search the paper for pictures of
their favorite foods to cutting a comic strip into individual
pictures and asking the child to put them in order.
   The exercises are designed ``to establish an enthusiastic
reading habit,'' said Sandra C. Hardy, chairwoman of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation, a nonprofit
educational organization and one of the project sponsors.
   She dismissed any suggestion that the ANPA Foundation's motive
in the project was to sell more newspapers.
   ``None (of the ANPA's members) would complain if their
circulation increased ... but there are more immediate and direct
ways to increase circulation,'' she said.

<HEAD>King Fahd Offers Olive Branch To Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd held out an olive branch
to Iran on Tuesday, 5{ months after severing relations with Tehran,
saying he was sorry the Iranians weren't at a meeting of Islamic
information ministers.
   ``I would have wished the Iranian delegation to be with us,'' he
told 45 ministers when the session opened in this Red Sea city.
   ``Iran is an Islamic country, and deep in my heart I would have
loved to see my Iranian brothers here today,'' the monarch said in
his speech.
   Fahd's signal was the clearest in a series of recent Saudi
gestures toward Iran.
   The king's moves came amid efforts by Tehran to improve its
relations with its Arab neighbors and Western nations following the
Aug. 20 United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the 8-year-old war
with Iraq.
   The Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Tehran April 26
after accusing the Tehran regime of carrying oJuly at the end of the hajj,
or annual pilgrimage to Islamic
shrines in Saudi Arabia.
   Iranian pilgrims boycotted the pilgrimage this year because of
the rift between the two Moslem nations.
   The king's remarks came a week after the Saudi government
executed four saboteurs it said were working on Iran's behalf.
   The Iranians have condemned the executions and accused Saudi
Arabia and other gulf Arab states of producing more oil than the
quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
drive down oil prices to weaken Tehran.
   Nonetheless, the war of words between the two gulf giants has
eased in recent months.
   Fahd's conciliatory gestures were in sharp contast to the
anti-Iranian sentiments in some of the literature handed out at the
conference.
   One tract, titled ``Khomeini and Israel,'' detailed alleged
dealings between Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime and the
Jewish state.
   Another was a slick publication in several languages and filled
with color photos of the bloody riots during the 1987 pilgrimage to
Mecca.
   More than 400 people, 275 of them Iranians, were killed in that
violence. Saudi officials said the bloodshed was instigated by
Iranian militants.
   The book also contained photos of Iranian dead and prisoners in
the war with Iraq as well as pictures of Iranian clerics and
black-cloaked women parading with automatic rifles and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
   The friction between Iran, whose 50 million population is
overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, and Saudi Arabia, most of whose 12
million people are Sunni Moslems, mirrors a centuries-old schism in
the Islamic world and historical animosity between the Arabs and
Persians.
   Fahd's remarks opened a meeting that officials indicated was
aimed at improving the exchange of information between Moslem
countries and Islam's image in the non-Moslem world.
   This reflected concerns, acknowledged privately by some
officials, that Iranian-backed terrorism and other aggressive
fundamentalist activities have harmed Islam, with 800 million
adherents around the world.
   During the gulf war, Iran accused Kuwait and Saudi Arabia of
aiding Iraq.
   Kuwait has increased diplomatic links with Tehran in what was
seen as a general move by gulf states to normalize relations with
Iran.

<TEXT>
   Elvis Presley's daughter, on a Caribbean
honeymoon after a surprise wedding last week, is pregnant and will
deliver the late king of rock 'n' roll's grandchild next spring,
her publicist said Tuesday.
   Lisa Marie Presley, 20, and aspiring musician Danny Keough, 23,
recited wedding vows on Oct. 3 during a small, private service at
the huge Hollywood headquarters of the Church of Scientology.
   ``Lisa and Danny have been talking for the past year about
getting married and starting a family,'' actress Priscilla Beaulieu
Presley, mother of Lisa Marie, said Tuesday through publicist Paul
Bloch.
   ``I couldn't be happier for the two of them at this very special
time in their lives,'' she said.
   The baby is due in the spring, Bloch said.
   Miss Presley is the only heir of the rock superstar, who died in
1977. Under the terms of the singer's will, when Lisa Marie turns
25 she will inherit an estate that was reported to be worth $50
million as of 1987. The estate includes Presley's landmark tourist
attraction mansion in Memphis, Tenn., Graceland.
   Her parents met when Presley was in the Army in the late 1950s,
when Priscilla was 14. They married in 1967 and Lisa Marie was born
the following year. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973.
   Miss Presley and her husband are in the Caribbean port of
Curacao, staying aboard the SMV Freewinds, which serves as a
sea-base retreat for Scientologists, the church said in a news
release this week.
   ``The couple is spending its honeymoon in the company of other
Scientologist celebrities currently aboard the ship, such as
internationally famous keyboardist Chick Corea and top U.S. Olympic
gymnast Charles Lakes,'' the church release said.
   Miss Presley recently completed an Oldsmobile television
commercial with her mother, whose most recent appearances have been
on the series ``Dallas.'' ``They always wanted to do something
together,'' Bloch said.

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed
an appeal by a Sikh sentenced to death for the 1984 assassination
of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   A panel of three judges said it found ``no merit to entertain
the petition'' of Kehar Singh, one of two Sikhs sentenced to death
by hanging for the 1984 murder of Mrs. Gandhi.
   Kehar Singh's lawyer, Ram Jethmalani, had said there was no
evidence linking his client _ who was convicted in January 1986 on
charges of conspiracy _ with the prime minister's assassination.
   Pratap Singh, a Sikh doctor, said in the appeal that he opposed
Kehar Singh's conviction because no autopsy was performed on Mrs.
Gandhi.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her New Delhi
home on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh
and Beant Singh.
   Security guards fired at the two after the assassination and
Beant Singh was killed. Satwant Singh was convicted of murder in
1986 and sentenced to death.
   The two Singhs were not related. Singh, which means lion in the
Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh's name by doctrine of the
faith.
   Kehar Singh, a former government employee and Beant Singh's
uncle, was arrested on Nov. 30, 1984, and charged with conspiracy.
He was convicted and sentenced to death along with Satwant Singh in
January 1986.
   The Supreme Court on Sept. 7 rejected a previous appeal by the
two men.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh have no legal appeal left, but
they can ask President Ramaswamy Venkataraman for mercy. If the
president turns down their pleas, they will be hanged.
   
   Mrs. Gandhi's assassination apparently was in revenge for an
army attack she ordered on Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden
Temple in Amritsar, which was used as a base by Sikh militants
fighting for a homeland in the northern state of Punjab. At least
2,000 Sikhs died in the attack.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 800 million people, but they
form a majority in Punjab. Radical members of the community claim
they are discriminated against by the Hindus.
   The Sikh campaign for a homeland has claimed more than 1,800
lives this year.

   City workers Tuesday removed the statue of
former President for Life Habib Bourguiba from its prominent place
in central Tunis as astonished passersby looked on.
   Bourguiba, 85 and living under surveillance in a villa south of
the capital, was ousted from power in 1987 by Premier Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali, who said Bourguiba had become senile.
   ``The present regime is not trying to hide history,'' said Tunis
Mayor Ahmed Belkhoja. ``The statue is not in the right place. It
will be transferred to La Goulette.''
   La Goulette is a port three miles outside Tunis where Bourguiba
landed in June 1955. The equestrian statue is supposed to symbolize
``the triumphal return'' of the young nationalist from France.
   France granted Tunisia independence in March 1956.
   Tuesday's statue removal follows several similar actions in
other regions of the country governed for 32 years by Bourguiba.
   Ben Ali has said Bourguiba would be transferred to another villa
in his native city of Monastir.

<HEAD>New Safety Procedures Will Delay Restart of Reactor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department officials, declaring a need
to ``rectify past sins'' in its operation of atomic reactors, today
announced that the introduction of new safety procedures would
delay restarting the Savannah River Plant, which produces nuclear
weapons materials.
   Energy Undersecretary Joseph Salgado also gave assurances that
plutonium and tritium supplies are adequate to ensure that existing
nuclear weapons would not degrade or be cannibalized to assure a
continued strategic deterrent.
   The three aging reactors at Savannah River, in Aiken S.C., have
been shut down for safety considerations. Construction of new
reactors to produce nuclear weapons materials is not expected to
start until the early 1990s.
   Salgado, addressing a midday news conference, said that Energy
Department officials have ordered engineers at the Savannah River
Plant to start up the K-reactor in December during a four-week
phased operation that should bring it close to full steam in early
January.
   Department officials have also decided to postpone restarting
the plant's P-reactor, which experienced problems in August. In
congressional testimony on Sept. 30, Salgado said the P-reactor
could be restarted within 30-45 days, but department officials now
have decided that it should not be brought back into operation
until late 1989, he said.
   The third facility at the plant, the L-reactor, is scheduled to
be restarted in the first three months of next year, he said.
   All three reactors will be started slowly, using what Deputy
Assistant Energy Secertary Richard W. Starostecki described as a
``phased'' operation designed to test and assess each step before
the reactor is brought to full power.
   New operating procedures are needed to ensure safety at Savannah
River, which has come under renewed scrutiny on Capitol Hill in the
wake of internal memoranda detailing operting problems since the
plant opened in the early 1950s, said Salgado, Starostecki and
other Energy Department officials.
   ``We have a moral obligation to rectify past sins,'' Salgado
told the news conference.
   An Energy Department statement issued after the news conference
said that ``three Savannah River reactors are the nation's only
source of the tritium needed for the nation's nuclear deterrent.''
Plutonium, also produced by the reactors, has a longer half-life
than tritium, and therefore does not pose as critical a problem.
   ``At present, all three reactors are out of service for routine
maintenance and accelerated safety upgrades,'' the statement said.
   ``The department is implementing a comprehensive program at the
Savannah River Plant to enable the facility to resume production of
tritium within acceptable margins of safety,'' it said.
   ``The program is designed to resolve uncertainties about safety
issues, improve operations, improve the department's technical
vigilance and strengthen oversight,'' it said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had
been briefed by his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin
Powell, on the Savannah River situation and related matters.
   ``We feel the supplies of tritium will be maintained as
production schedules are maintained in a safe manner,'' Fitzwater
said.

<HEAD>Naval Researcher Turns Sewer Gas Into Diamonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy chemist has found a way to convert
sewer gas into diamonds.
   Dr. James E. Butler tapped Washington's sewage system for the
methane gas he used to grow diamond crystals at the Naval Research
Laboratory. Other chemists at the lab have grown diamond crystals
by using an oxygen-acetylene torch, Butler said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.
   The tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical vapors to
deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of industrial
applications, including abrasives, protective coatings, and
computer insulators, he said.
   But ``I don't think we'll be able to grow diamonds of gemstone
size and quality in the near future,'' Butler said.
   The Navy scientists are working on a process that entails
heating chemical vapors, under normal air pressure or less, and
getting carbon from the vapor to crystallize on a surface at
temperatures of about 1,440 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Current industrial processes for making diamonds require much
higher heat and pressure.
   Why use sewer gas?
   ``Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive
source of methane,'' Butler said. The Naval Research Laboratory is
next door to Washington's Blue Plains Waste Water Treatment Plant.
   Methane, a combination of carbon and hydrogen, is a primary
constituent of sewer gas. It is generally burned as waste.
   Researchers in other countries have performed some similar
experiments, Butler said, commenting that such sources of carbon as
vodka have also been used.
   It will be years before the diamond-making system could be
developed into an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens
plenty of raw material will be available.

<HEAD>Study Urges Steps to Screen Impaired Elderly Motorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal study of elderly motorists called
Tuesday for better screening to identify impaired drivers, but
concluded there is no justification to restrict driving solely on
the basis of age.
   The report by the National Research Council said that older
drivers pose a greater risk of being involved in accidents because
of their slower reaction time, vision problems and difficulties in
gauging heavy traffic flow.
   But the study said while driving skills often deteriorate after
age 75, many elderly people are ``capable and safe drivers'' who
pose less of a risk to highway safety than teen-age drivers.
   The panel of experts suggested some of the problems with elderly
drivers could be eased if roadway signs were made larger and
brighter and highway markings were redesigned to meet the needs of
older drivers. Many road signs cannot properly be seen by 40
percent of the drivers who are 65 years of age or older, the study
said.
   ``Age alone is a poor predictor of the (driving) performance of
any individual,'' said the report, although acknowledging after age
75 a driver is ``about twice as likely (per mile driven) to be
involved in a crash'' as middle-aged drivers.
   The panel called on states to adopt tougher screening methods to
weed out problem drivers no matter what their age. It also
suggested broader reliance on restricted licenses such as limiting
driving by some elderly people to daylight hours if they have
problems seeing at night.
   In a cost-saving effort, some states in recent years have turned
to mail-in license renewals, the study noted. It criticized such
practices, saying drivers should be required to undergo vision
tests at least every four years as part of their license renewal.
   The National Research Council panel, composed of experts
assembled by the National Academy of Sciences, spent two years
examining questions about transportation and the elderly.
   It said problems of meeting the transportation needs of older
citizens will increase in the future as the number of people over
age 75 increases and more elderly people live in the suburbs, where
less public transit is available.
   Today about 12 percent of the population is 65 years of age or
older. By the year 2020 the number will increase to about 17
percent, or more than 50 million elderly citizens who will be
eligible to drive.
   ``The states are not prepared to handle the growing number of
very old drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident
involvement,'' the study concluded.
   ``Most older persons will probably be quite capable and safe
drivers. But current statistics indicate that drivers 75 and over
are more at risk of crash involvement than the average driver. ...
These facts must be acknowledged even though there is no
justification for restricting driving on the basis of age alone,''
it continued.
   Furthermore, the panel said, elderly people are more likely to
suffer serious or fatal injuries than other drivers in accidents of
similar severity.
   The study said elderly people, especially those 75 years or
older, often have problems seeing clearly at night, gauging traffic
flow when merging or making left turns, and turning their heads
when backing their vehicles.
   Communities should improve public transit for the elderly,
develop subsidized taxi programs and construct walkways in suburban
areas if the transportation requirements of the elderly are to be
met, the study said.

<TEXT>
   Montana and Wyoming officials are plotting
a $3 million program to get a message to the world's vacationers:
Yellowstone National Park is still there and worth visiting.
   John Wilson, chief of Montana's travel promotion office, said
the two states have asked for $3 million in federal money to
convince travelers, here and abroad, that the wildfires of 1988
left much of the park unscarred.
   Reports on the fires wrongly suggested most of the park was
blackened, said Wilson. ``There wasn't a blanket wall of flame that
just obliterated 1.2 million acres of the park,'' he said.
   While the boundaries of the fires may have encompassed about
half of Yellowstone, only 40 percent of that land actually burned
and a third of that was meadows and undergrowth that will quickly
grow back, he said.
   Also, the fires did not wipe out wildlife or fisheries, and the
major structures and natural features were undamaged, Wilson said.
   Before a Sept. 28 meeting with Wyoming tourism officials and
park representatives at Mammoth, Wilson and members of the Montana
Tourism Advisory Council toured Yellowstone and were buoyed by how
much of it remained uncharred.
   ``It lifted our spirits,'' he said. ``We thought the damage was
going to be much greater than we saw. The fires burned a mosaic.
The beauty of the park will come back.''
   There are areas that were severely burned, but much of the
underlying layer of plants and grass will grow back next year, he
said.
   ``Yellowstone is alive and well,'' he added. ``We can put an
honest effort together to tell the rest of the world.''
   The states are working together on a 15-minute film chronicling
the condition of Yellowstone, the oldest national park. The film
will be sent to travel agencies, tour planners and magazines,
Wilson said.
   If federal funding is provided, the states may conduct ``trade
missions'' to personally spread the message throughout the country,
he said.

   Nancy Reagan called George Bush and his wife
to say she is ``very supportive'' of Bush's presidential campaign
and to deny reports she's loath to turn the White House over to
them, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   ``The stories are not true,'' Fitzwater said when asked to
respond to several recent published reports.
   Fitzwater called such stories ``outrageous'' and said it would
be wrong to assume President Reagan's wife did not support Bush
because she has not been present at some campaign appearances.
   ``She has not gone on day trips, as I recall, ever,'' the
spokesman said.
   He added, ``The first lady is very supportive'' of the Bushes.
   Fitzwater said Mrs. Reagan first spoke with the vice president
on Monday, and then later with Barbara Bush because the vice
president's wife was not present when she first called.
   ``The vice president sent her a note thanking her for her
graciousness and support over the last eight years,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen, said, ``I have to
laugh _ a year ago, stories were written about her house-hunting
and how eager she was to leave. Now, it's said she'll flatten the
tires on the moving truck.''
   The spokeswoman said Mrs. Reagan referred to the stories as
``such foolishness.'' And Mrs. Crispen recalled that at the
Republican Convention in New Orleans Mrs. Reagan spoke publicly of
``it being time to leave center stage'' and of her confidence in
and support of the Bushes.
   The spokeswoman said Mrs. Reagan did not attend one Los Angeles
rally for the Bushes because the event was scheduled after she had
made appointments to be with friends and to deal with the Reagans'
new home in Bel Air.
   ``She's never campaigned for anyone but Ronald Reagan _ but that
doesn't mean she doesn't support the Bushes,'' Mrs. Crispen said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government-run newspaper said Tuesday
there has been no progress in the Iran-Iraq peace talks since they
started over six weeks ago.
   The front page editorial in Al-Joumhouriya was the first comment
by Iraq's official media on the statement Saturday by Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati, who said the two sides agreed
in principle to United Nations proposals to end the war.
   The daily said that the peace talks to end the war remain
deadlocked because Iran has not committed itself to respecting free
navigation in the Persian Gulf and clearing the Shaat al-Arab
waterway.
   It said there was no breakthrough in negotiations and accused
Iran of continuing ``delaying tactics and procrastination.''
   The negotiations are ``still on square one where they started on
Aug. 25,'' Al-Joumhouriya said of the talks, which moved from
Geneva to New York and are expected to return to Geneva at the end
of the month.
   The paper said that Iraq will not give up its demand for free
navigation in the gulf and the clearance of the Shatt al-Arab, the
estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and Iraq's main outlet
to the sea.
   Velayati said that Iran agreed to a U.N. proposal that it give
up its right to search ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic
mouth of the gulf.
   He did not mention Iraq's demand to clear the Shatt al-Arab,
which forms the southern boundary between the foes, before letting
the talks progress.
   ``Neither of the two principles can be substituted for the
other,'' Al-Joumhouriya said. ``Both are closely linked.''
   The paper said that Iraq cannot benefit from free navigation in
the gulf without being able to use the Shatt Al-Arab.
   ``Iraq will not relinquish its rights in seeing these two
principles applied,'' the paper said.
   Al-Joumhouriya said ``Iraq is ready to show the same patience it
displayed during the war, but the Iranian rulers should realize
that they are impeding the process of peace,''it said.
   In a related development, a senior U.N. official visited the
Iraqi port of Basra, the country's second-largest city, and the
southern sector of the warfront.
   U.N. peacekeeping troops have been posted along the border to
monitor the cease-fire in the 8-year-old war.

<HEAD>Maryland Campus Begins Testing Thousands of Students for AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand University of Maryland
students are being tested for AIDS in what researchers say is the
first voluntary study to determine how widespread the disease is on
a college campus.
   The university's College Park campus was selected because, with
38,000 students, it is one of the nation's most populated campuses,
enrolls a heterogeneous group of students, and is in the
Washington-Baltimore area, where the AIDS virus is more prevalent
than is typical nationwide, researchers said.
   The study is sponsored by the University of Maryland's medical
school in Baltimore and the National Institute for Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda.
   ``We won't be able to say where the infection was obtained, but
we'll be able to assess the rate,'' said the study's director, Dr.
Karen Kotloff, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious
diseases at the University of Maryland at Baltimore.
   ``This is one very unique population we are monitoring; a large,
somewhat contained population with a high level of sexual
activity,'' Kotloff said Tuesday.
   Kotloff said she did not expect the rate of positive test
results for the AIDS antibody to be as high among college students
as among military recruits, an equivalent age group. Tests of
military recruits found 1.6 out of every 1,000 tested positive for
the HIV virus.
   About 200 students were tested Monday, the day the study began,
Kotloff said. Researchers hope to draw blood from 6,000 students
through Nov. 30.
   Students in late adolescence and their early 20s ``simply don't
perceive themselves as being at risk'' because they identify
acquired immune deficiency syndrome as a disease that primarily
strikes homosexual men and intravenous drug users, said Stan
Kinder, assistant director of the university health center.
   Students who participated expressed hope the study would
increase awareness.
   ``I think it's really good they're doing it because maybe it
will make people more aware you can't just jump in anybody's bed
and cavort around,'' said Tanya Mattocks, a sophomore. ``The
disease is there. You can't just say, `I won't get it.'''
   Senior Tom Fennelly called the study ``a good way for students
who are shy about it to find out confidentially if they have the
virus.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta is also
sponsoring a study involving 20 campuses nationwide, including
College Park. Each campus is being asked to provide samples of
blood from 1,000 students.
   Kotloff said the new study differs significantly from the CDC's.
The CDC study is an anonymous test of the blood of students who
come into campus health clinics for other reasons and gave a blood
sample while they are there.
   The College Park study uses volunteers who are asked to complete
a questionnaire about their sexual practices, along with basic
information such as age, race, sex and residence. Students are
counseled about the implications of the test results before
donating blood, Kotloff said.
   Participants will be able to find out the result of their tests,
which will remain confidential, officials said.
   Kotloff said her study will also test an additional 2,000 blood
samples obtained anonymously to use as a check of the voluntary
study.

<HEAD>Court Will Up Illinois Civil Rights Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to decide the
deadlines for filing a civil rights discrimination case.
   The case involves Patricia A. Lorance, Janice M. King and Carol
S. Bueschen, employees in the AT&T's Montgomery Works in Aurora,
Ill. who were demoted in 1982 because of a restructured seniority
system.
   The women claim that the seniority system incorporated into a
contract between AT&T Technologies and Local 1942 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers were designed to
limit the job rights of female workers who had recently been
promoted into traditionally male jobs.
   They filed charges with the Equal Opportunity Commission in
April 1983, within the 300-day time period prescribed by law _ if
that period started with the date the seniority system caused their
demotions.
   In 1986, a federal magistrate determined the three had ``slept''
on their rights because they did not file charges within 300 days
of when the new seniority system was adopted in August 1980. A
federal district judge and the
   7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued similar rulings.
   The plaintiffs' lawyers told the high court that there are
conflicts among different appeals court circuits on what
constitutes filing within a proper time limits.
   ``Three circuits have determined that the mere existence without
an application of a discriminatory practice is an insufficient
basis for a cause of action,'' they told the court in their
petition for a hearing.
   ``However, the 7th Circuit requires workers to forfeit their
rights if they do not file charges of discrimination within 300
days of becoming subject to a discriminatory practice even though
there has been no application of the practice.''
   The case is Lorance vs. AT&T Technologies, 87-1428

<TEXT>
   Nearly 11,000 Kurdish refugees who
fled Iraq for Turkey amid allegations of chemical weapon attacks on
their homes reportedly have been transfered to Iran in the last
four days.
   Turkey's semi-official news agency, Anatolia, reported Tuesday
that 10,862 refugees, who were among the 60,000 Kurds who fled
Iraq, were taken in buses and trucks from two tent cities in
southeast Turkey and transferred to Iran.
   Anatolia reported the refugees were settled at a Kurdish camp
called Zive, which was operated by Massoud Barzani, president of
the Kurdish Democratic Party. Zive is near the Iraqi border.
   About 8,000 went to Iran last month before the transfers were
halted because of lack of shelter.
   Iran offered to accept any of the Kurdish refugees in Turkey.
During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran supported Kurdish guerrillas
fighting for autonomy in northern Iraq.
   Last week 1,467 Kurds returned to Iraq voluntarily.
   Iraq started its offensive against the Kurds soon after Iran
agreed to a ceasefire in the 8-year-old war.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper poll showing Republican
presidential nominee George Bush trailing Democrat Michael Dukakis
in Wisconsin also indicates Bush's selection of running mate Dan
Quayle is unpopular with roughly half of those surveyed.
   The Milwaukee Journal poll, conducted after the vice
presidential debate Wednesday and released Monday, showed Dukakis
leading Bush 50 percent to 43 percent among residents of Wisconsin,
a state that offers 11 electoral votes in the Nov. 8 election.
   Dukakis led Bush by the same seven-point margin in a poll taken
last month, though a survey last June showed the Massachusetts
governor up by 14 points.
   As for the vice presidential hopefuls, nearly half the
respondents _ 46 percent _ viewed GOP nominee Dan Quayle as
unqualified to assume the presidency in an emergency. Sixteen
percent felt his Democratic counterpart Lloyd Bentsen lacked the
needed credentials to serve in that capacity.
   The poll, based on interviews with 604 Wisconsin residents of
voting age who said they were either absolutely or fairly certain
to vote, had a margin of potential sampling error of four
percentage points.

   Stevie Wonder's unannounced visit to this
quiet town created a two-day traffic jam and spoiled his plans for
a restful low-profile weekend.
   Wonder accompanied Miss Arkansas 1980 Lencola Sullivan on a
visit to her hometown. Ms. Sullivan said the two have been seeing
each other for about six months and that Wonder ``wanted to meet my
parents and see Arkansas.''
   On Sunday morning, the couple attended services at a small
church near Ms. Sullivan's home. To the surprise of the
congregation, Wonder performed three songs. Word soon got out and
fans staked out the home, snarling traffic in the area for most of
Sunday and Monday.
   When the two went shopping Sunday afternoon in Conway, east of
Morrilton, Wonder was mobbed by autograph hounds. Wonder and Ms.
Sullivan left Arkansas late Monday. They both live in New York.
   Asked how serious their relationship was, Ms. Sullivan said:
``Right now we're just very close friends, but by him wanting to
meet my parents that should say something.''

   Divorces don't come cheaply, especially
when you make $61 million, so a local rock band is throwing a
benefit concert for Bruce Springsteen.
   The announcement for the Oct. 29 ``Bucks for Boss'' benefit by
the Decibels was tinged with sarcasm.
   ``His upcoming, self-inflicted divorce and all the time he has
donated to causes have probably drained the guy,'' the release said.
   Springsteen is participating in the ``Human Rights Now!'' world
tour for Amnesty International. Forbes Magazine recently computed
the singer's earnings for 1987-1988 as $61 million.
   The rocker is in the midst of a divorce from actress Julianne
Phillips, his wife since 1985.
   The Decibels plan to give away a pink Cadillac at the concert, a
prize inspired by Springsteen's hit song about the car. If
Springsteen doesn't pick up proceeds from the benefit by Nov. 15,
the band says it will donate the money to environmental
organizations.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alex Haley's
latest project is a biography about Indianapolis philanthropist
Madame C.J. Walker, the first black woman to earn $1 million in her
own right.
   Haley, the author of ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' and the
1976 best seller ``Roots,'' said when he was considering the
project he didn't necessarily have a black figure in mind, but he
did want to write about a woman.
   Walker, the daughter of ex-slaves, propelled herself from
washerwoman to businesswoman and activist. She built her fortune in
the early 1900s, developing and selling cosmetics and hair care
products.
   ``Given where she came from, it's extremely thrilling she did
all she did,'' said Haley. ``She's a fantastic story.''
   Haley said there has been talk of turning his unpublished book
into a film, possibly with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, but ``We
haven't made a deal yet.''
   Haley will be in Indianapolis Friday for the opening of the
renovated Madame C.J. Walker Theatre, next to the factory Walker
opened in 1910.

   Residents will decide next month whether a
proposal to permit predominantly black Boston neighborhoods to
become a separate new city named Mandela amounts to segregation or
good civic sense.
   The non-binding referendum on the ballot Nov. 8 is similar to
one soundly defeated in 1986 by a 3-1 margin. Those results were
far better than the 9-1 margin of defeat predicted and backers who
say the change would improve municipal services said they were
encouraged to try again.
   ``If the reaction had been a big yawn, then we probably wouldn't
be doing this right now,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing, a Boston
Democrat.
   But this time there is little of the excitement created two
years ago. The movement that inspired its own rap song in 1986
hasn't even drawn formal opposition this time.
   The Rev. Charles R. Stith, a prominent black leader and a chief
opponent, said the proposed city of Mandela, named after jailed
black South African nationalist Nelson Mandela, could not survive
without the citywide tax base of Boston.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn opposes the referendum because it would
segregate the community, said his press secretary, Arthur Jones.
   And if the measure were approved, it would have to be signed by
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who also is against it.
   The proposed city of about 125,000 people would include a
12{-square-mile area made up of all of Roxbury and parts of the
Dorchester, Mattapan and Jamaica Plain sections of the city. Boston
covers 42.7 square miles and has 570,000 residents.
   Supporters argue the areas have long been neglected and would
fare better with control of their own tax dollars.
   The secession drive stemmed from a feeling that city leaders had
run out of options for improving municipal services such as police
and garbage collection, said Andrew P. Jones, a violinist and
independent television producer. He was a co-founder of the Greater
Roxbury Incorporation Project that got the secession movement
started.
   ``Right now, hardly any of the teachers send their kids to our
schools,'' he said. ``Most of the police live outside the
community. If the police live in the community, then they're
protecting their home. If they just work in the community, then
they're protecting their job.''
   Jones says his support of the proposal is to blame for an
attempt to evict him from his apartment. The owners of the building
insist the matter has nothing to do with politics.
   The secession proposal will be voted on in 10 state
representative districts covering all of proposed Mandela and some
fringe areas that include white residents.
   Rushing said he expects white residents who vote for the measure
would do so for improved municipal services, not to promote
segregation.
   If the non-binding referendum passes, Rushing said he would
introduce secession legislation, which would eventually lead to a
citywide vote.
   The campaign has sparked charges of reverse racism and
segregationism, but Rushing said eyebrows would not be raised if
white neighborhoods were trying to secede.
   Choosing the name of Mandela gave some a false impression that
the campaign had a militant character, Rushing said. In fact, he
said, the incorporation campaign is merely a way to control and
improve municipal services.
   ``It is a symptom of racism in this country that ... you always
expect black people to somehow want to be with white people,''
Rushing said. ``That's what I call paternalistic.
   ``This is not Utopian. If this happens, all the problems are not
going to be solved. The question here though is will things get
better if you have more direct control.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday reassured Prince
Norodom Sihanouk that the United States supports the former
Cambodian ruler's quest to win a negotiated political settlement in
the war-torn country, a White House spokesman said.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president reiterated
American policy favoring a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops
and opposing a return to power of the Khmer Rouge, the communist
group that ruled Cambodia during the mass killings and forced
relocations of the 1970s. The Khmer Rouge were overthrown by the
Vietnamese in 1978 and replaced with a regime installed by Hanoi.
   Describing a meeting that Reagan and Sihanouk had in the Oval
Office, the spokesman said the president ``told the prince that the
United States is prepared to join an international conference to
ratify any solution worked out by the parties and, further, that we
believe an international presence in Camobodia is needed.''
   Reagan met briefly with Sihanouk, who heads the National Party
Sihanouk, an anti-communist faction now loosely aligned with the
Khmer Rouge against Vietnamese occupation forces.
   Sihanouk will hold talks with State Department officials before
traveling to New York later in the week for discussions with
diplomats at the United Nations.
   Answering reporters' questions after meeting with Reagan,
Sihanouk said he seeks a moderate leadership of the Khmer Rouge and
would support any move to exile Pol Pot and other leading Khmer
Rouge figures to China.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that many Asian officials
see exile in China for Khmer Rouge leaders as a key element in any
political settlement for Cambodia.
   But Sihanouk said that in his recent trip to Peking, ``I did not
get from China any indication that China would like to accept a Pol
Pot in exile.''
   Sihanouk, speaking in English, also said, ``I think the ones who
are responsible for the genocide of the Cambodian people'' in the
1970s ``must not continue to lead the Khmer Rouge movement and they
must go into exile if possible.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan and Sihanouk talked about ``a peacekeeping
force, a U.N. force of some kind. I think we would want to reserve
some flexibility in how that would be defined.''
   He also said that Reagan ``strongly supports increased aid to
the non-communist resistance and we are consulting with Congress to
bring that about.''
   The United States provided $3.5 million in aid to Cambodia last
year and plans to increase that to as much as $5 million this year,
although this figure ``may fluctuate,'' he said. Fitzwater said
Reagan and Sihanouk did not discuss new aid figures.
   Sihanouk said he is ``not optimistic'' about the prospects for
peace talks he is scheduled to have in Paris in early November with
Hun Sen, the Hanoi-installed prime minister of Cambodia.
   ``There are still obstacles and difficulties on the road towards
solution, because of Vietnam itself, because of the puppet regime
in Pnom Penh,'' he said. ``They continue to refuse ... to give a
precise timetable concerning the withdrawal from Cambodia of the
Vietnamese troops,''
   The Vietnamese announced months ago that they planned to pull as
many as 50,000 of their more than 120,000 troops out of Cambodia by
the end of this year. But there have been reports that the pace of
the pull-out has stalled as some Vietnamese have remained behind to
keep the Khmer Rouge from capturing abandoned territory.
   Sihanouk also said he has asked French President Francois
Mitterand to organize an international peace conference on Cambodia
in Paris. He said such a conference should include the Soviet
Union, Vietnam, China and the United States.

   When Jose Canseco steps up to home plate
during the World Series, the hopes of more than baseball fans will
be riding on his performance.
   Civic leaders, investors and residents hope the World Series
will do what years of community effort and millions of dollars have
so far failed to do: Make this ``other'' City-by-the-Bay a major
league town.
   Plagued by drug problems, high crime and an economy that stalled
somewhere after World War II, Oakland has hovered in the shadow of
big neighbor San Francisco.
   The city's image is so bad ``it almost makes you feel bad to say
you live in Oakland,'' said Phyllis Bonner, a resident of the Acorn
Housing Project, a complex plagued by drug-related crime.
   The city's chance may finally have arrived now that the Oakland
A's have earned a spot in the World Series.
   ``It's exciting, everybody's talking about it,'' said Elva
Manuel, another resident of the Acorn project. She hopes the Series
will improve the city's image. ``It can't get any worse,'' she said.
   Now that the city is to be host to baseball fans and television
cameras, the Oakland Chamber of Commerce is hanging banners,
wrapping hospitality baskets in green and gold and painting
billboards touting the city.
   ``We've had our problems with drugs and crime, there's no
question,'' said acting Chamber president Connie Shapiro. ``But
there's been a real turnaround.''
   Among Oakland's blessings are a world-class port and a climate
that's the envy of fog-enshrouded San Franciscans, who routinely
endure consecutive summer days with barely a glimpse of the sun.
   More than 356,000 people live in Oakland, about 10 miles
southeast of San Francisco, although the Oakland A's draw fans from
all over the Bay area.
   ``There's an excitement created by the Oakland A's that's picked
up by many, many people _ of all ages ... and all economic levels
of the city,'' Mayor Lionel Wilson said. ``It really wasn't there
until the last couple of years. You can see it. You can feel it.''
   The best-of-seven World Series opens Saturday in either New York
City or Los Angeles, depending on the outcome of the National
League playoffs, and comes to Oakland on Tuesday.
   Officials expect the World Series to generate at least $5
million for the city each of up to three days the teams face off in
Oakland, in addition to an estimated $7 million for the Oakland
Coliseum.
   Ed Church, director of program development for a community-based
advocacy and planning organization called the Urban Strategies
Council, hopes the Series will provide a ``psychological boost.''
   ``If people talk about Oakland derisively, people pick up on
that,'' he said. ``When people come here from around the country,
they're amazed. They find it's a beautiful, beautiful place.''
   Indeed, Oakland has had serious problems.
   Infant mortality rates, down dramatically from a decade ago,
still remain well above the national average. Drug-linked killings
were up 83 percent in 1987 from the year before. In 1986, Oakland
had the nation's 10th-highest homicide rate.
   Wilson's efforts to revitalize downtown met with moderate
success. The Hyatt Regency built a hotel downtown five years ago,
but it didn't turn a profit until last year.
   The Oakland Symphony canceled its season not long ago. The zoo
was nearly closed for lack of funds. The Oakland Museum has
suffered budget cuts.
   Some say the city hasn't been the same since it lost the Oakland
Raiders to Los Angeles in a 1982 National Football League transfer.
   But an upscale shopping hub is on the drawing boards for
downtown. Big-name retailers such as Nordstrom, Neiman-Marcus and
possibly Saks Fifth Avenue have expressed interest, said Chamber
President Shapiro.
   Harry Edwards, a sociology professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who pioneered the field of sports sociology,
doubts that the Series alone will turn around Oakland's image.
   Business will benefit, he said, but for the rest of Oakland, the
Series will be ``at best a nice entertainment spectacle.''
   ``It's like Christmas,'' he said. ``It depends on how low down
in the slime you are. At some point, it could be a very depressing
thing.''
   And history may offer a lesson for those who pin their dreams of
Oakland's renaissance on the World Series: The Oakland A's were the
world champions for three years starting in 1972.

   Gun-wielding bandits ambushed a truck

<TEXT>
   A Bureau of Land Management ground search in
central Nevada has found 180 more slaughtered wild horses to bring
the total of mustangs believed shot to death up to 450, BLM
officials said Tuesday.
   ``Every time we go out there, we seem to find more,'' BLM
spokesman Bob Stewart said. ``The carnage that occurred out there
was terrible, almost unbelievable.''
   The carcasses have been found in wild horse management areas on
unfenced federal land. Killing them is a violation of the Wild and
Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971, a misdemeanor with a
penalty of up to a $2,000 fine and one year in jail for each dead
animal.
   Stewart said he would not be surprised if more carcasses were
found before the investigation is complete.
   He refused to say if the BLM had any suspects or strong leads.
One possible motive is that in some areas the horses consume scarce
water and grass in areas that also are leased for cattle grazing.
   Maxine Shane, another BLM public affairs officer, said federal
authorities in Washington have ``promised us the full resources of
the BLM to solve this case.''
   ``We're not at liberty to say how many people are working on the
case,'' she added.
   Discovery of the mass horse killings began last month with the
sighting from a helicopter of 41 carcasses in the Austin area.
   Since then, the discoveries have spread over 102,000 acres,
mostly in Lander County. Stewart said the investigation has been
difficult because the shootings were spread over such a vast area.
   Last week, BLM officials spotted 140 carcasses near Bald
Mountain during a aerial search, bringing the total found to 268.
The ground search in the same area during this weekend turned up
the additional carcasses for a total of 450.
   ``You just can't see as many from the air; it takes a trained
eye,'' Stewart said. ``So every time we spot them in a plane we
know there'll be more on the ground than we can count.''
   Ms. Shane said the killings apparently began about two years
ago, although some of the horses were shot late this spring or
early this summer.
   Investigators believe the slaughters in the Bald Mountain and
Mount Callaghan areas are related, Ms. Shane said. But killings in
the Mount Moses area near the Pershing-Lander county border are
being handled as a separate case, she said.
   There are an estimated 28,000 wild horses in Nevada.
   Rewards as high as $12,000 have been pledged by animal rights
groups for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
those responsible.

<HEAD>Senate Debates Tax Bill Loaded With Special Provisions</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: top 5 grafs new with Bradley amendment; picks up pvs graf 5:

<TEXT>
   The Senate, putting the finishing touches on a
$2.7 billion tax bill that would dole out special benefits to
selected individuals and businesses, refused today to boost a
special tax benefit for low-income working families.
   On an 85-2 vote, the Senate defeated an amendment by Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., that would have raised the maximum earned-income
credit for families from $875 to $978 a year. Bradley would have
financed the increase by deleting from the bill several provisions
that would have helped corporations and some individuals.
   ``This is not the time to do it,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who
is managing the bill, told Bradley. Baucus said the amendment would
have jeopardized passage of the bill.
   Only Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., voted with Bradley.
   The legislation, which includes a ``bill of rights'' for
taxpayers tangling with the Internal Revenue Service, is one of two
items standing in the way of final adjournment of the 100th
Congress. Leaders of the House and Senate hope to finish the tax
bill and approve a battle plan against drug abuse before quitting
by weekend.
   Before a final vote on the tax bill, the Senate faced two dozen
amendments that would add new provisions or remove others that the
Finance Committee wrote into the voluminous measure. Whatever
version finally is approved by the Senate must be reconciled with a
larger one approved by the House _ and then could face a veto by
President Reagan.
   One of the thorniest amendments to be considered by the Senate,
written by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, would allow corporations set
up by Alaska natives to keep a special but costly tax benefit that
the bill otherwise would repeal. Opponents say the benefit has been
abused.
   Other amendments would expand the earned-income credit, which
benefits low-income working families with children; eliminate a
provision calling for a Treasury Department study of how the
cigarette tax affects the number of smokers; and impose sanctions
against Iraq for using poison gas against its Kurdish minority.
   Like any tax bill, this one is used by senators to promote
favorite projects. In a long day of debate on Friday, for example,
senators sought to add provisions dealing with abortion, equal pay
for jobs of comparable worth, a bigger tax break for some commuters
and a requirement that television programs provided to cable
systems also be made available to owners of home satellite dishes.
   The Senate added one big unrelated amendment that could result
in a veto of the entire bill. That would require the federal
government to seize 540 acres of land that was the site of the
Second Battle of Manassas in Northern Virginia, in order to block
construction of a shopping mall at the site.
   The House has approved the same provision but not as part of the
tax bill. The Reagan administration wants to protect only 80 acres
of the site.
   Congress began work on the bill in the summer of 1986,
immediately after it passed the landmark overhaul of the tax law.
Its main purpose is to correct errors and clear up ambiguities in
that new law.
   But because the ``technical corrections'' measure is the only
tax bill with a chance of becoming law this year, the Finance
Committee attached to it dozens of amendments and the assorted tax
increases to pay for them.
   The amendments include a ``taxpayers' bill of rights,'' which,
among other things, requires the IRS to inform an individual of all
rights and obligations any time he or she is questioned or the
subject of collections arises.
   The bill would extend a handful of expiring tax benefits,
including those that go to workers with employer-paid legal or
educational assistance, first-time homebuyers and corporations that
increase spending for research.
   It would exempt farmers from paying tax on off-road diesel fuel,
allow immediate write-offs of certain expenses associated with
livestock and permit delays in paying tax on any livestock that was
sold this year because of the drought.
   Under the bill, freelance writers and artists could deduct
certain expenses before their works produce income, and families
could avoid tax on interest earned on U.S. savings bonds that are
redeemed to pay for higher education.

   Philippine and U.S. officials have
tentatively agreed that Washington will pay more than $550 million
annual compensation to use its military bases in the Phillipines,
official sources said Tuesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an accord
on terms to cover the U.S. lease through 1991 is expected within a
week.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
there was no agreement. Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur
and Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus discussed the
subject there Tuesday.
   The Philippine sources said negotiators agreed on a basic annual
package of $550 million to $580 million in economic support,
military aid and commodities, mostly wheat, for the United States'
continued use of the six bases through 1991.
   U.S. and Filipino panels began reviewing the 1947 agreement on
the base leases in April, but talks stalled over compensation and
other issues.
   The United States has been paying about $180 million a year
under the current agreement, but Filipino officials reportedly want
that increased to $1.2 billion for the last two years of the lease.
The facilities include Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base and
comprise the largest U.S. garrison in southeast Asia.
   Any extension on the lease past 1991 must be approved by
two-thirds of the 23-member senate, where opposition to the U.S.
presence is strong. Mrs. Aquino, who holds office until 1992, has
refused to say where she stands on the issue.
   Opponents of the bases say they infringe on Philippine
sovereignty and pose dangers to the country in the event of
superpower conflicts.
   Sources close to the talks said the Filipino negotiators in
Washington were bargaining for an additional loan of $100 million
to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds, which would be used to help pay
the Philippines' $28 billion foreign debt.
   Teodoro Benigno, the spokesman for President Corazon Aquino,
told reporters the size of the compensation package had not yet
been agreed upon. He said the $550 million figure was a ``hard cash
component'' and officials were still discussing ``creative''
portions, meaning the debt relief part.
   In congress, Rep. Renato Unico told reporters that U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Platt, who heads the American negotiating
panel, met him and another pro-administration congressman at lunch
Tuesday.
   He quoted Platt as saying that the Americans were offering $481
million a year through 1991 and that U.S. officials believe most
Filipinos will opt for the retention of the bases when the lease
expires.
   It was not clear if the figure Platt mentioned was offered
before Manglapus went to Washington.

<TEXT>
   To his supporters, Serbian Communist
Party chief Slobodan Milosevic is ``the second Tito,'' the new
leader Yugoslavia needs to extricate the country from its worst
crisis since World War II.
   To his detractors, Milosevic is a Serbian nationalist who
threatens the delicate unity of his ethnically diverse nation and
wants to expand the power of Serbs at the expense of other ethnic
groups.
   Milosevic has ridden to national prominence in recent months on
a wave of mass rallies by Slavs enraged by the alleged harassment
of the Serb and Montenegrin minority in Kosovo, a backward southern
Serbian province now dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   The 47-year-old Serbian leader has won the hearts of the crowds
who adoringly wave his portrait with a combination of tough
politicking and rousing oratory.
   By pushing for greater control over Serbia's two autonomous
provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, Milosevic has struck a chord
with many of Yugoslavia's 8 million Serbs, who have a strong
attachment to Kosovo because it was the heart of their medieval
empire.
   But he has automatically antagonized other ethnic groups fearful
of Serbian nationalism and may be toppled by communist leaders from
other republics if they feel he is pushing too hard.
   Milosevic's chief opponents _ the communists in Yugoslavia's
most prosperous republics of Slovenia and Croatia _ may force a
showdown as early as next week, when the party holds a key meeting
of its Central Committee.
   There, Milosevic is expected to come under fire for failing to
stop the nationalist rallies and allowing them to turn into
anti-government protests, as they did in the southern republic of
Montenegro last weekend.
   If Milosevic is ousted, however, the other republics could face
even worse unrest from the Serbs who see him as a hero.
   Some of Yugoslavia's top leaders got a taste of Milosevic's hold
over Serbs last week when angry workers from the Belgrade
industrial suburb of Rakovica marched on the federal parliament
demanding wage hikes to feed their families.
   Belgrade journalists at the scene said leaders such as vice
premier Milos Milosavljevic and Dusan Popovski, president of
parliament, hesitated before addressing the crowd, and were
instantly booed by workers shouting Milosevic's name.
   Displaying a populist touch that has helped him rise throughout
his political career, Milosevic drove up in his own Yugo and calmly
told the workers to leave.
   ``They were hypnotized by him,'' recalled a journalist who saw
the scene.
   Born Aug. 20, 1941 in the southern Serbian town of Pozarevac,
Milosevic studied social sciences in Belgrade before going into
industry.
   His political career began in earnest only in 1982, when he quit
his job as president of the boar at a Belgrade bank to sit on the
presidium, or top party body, in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian
capital.
   In 1984, he gained a seat on the party presidium in Serbia,
vaulting into the top party seat last year after making his mark at
a demonstration in Kosovo, where he prevented police from beating a
crowd of Slav protesters.
   To get the top spot in Serbia, Milosevic forced out a man who
had been his political patron, Petar Stambolic.
   Milosevic succeeded by skillful use of the Serbian media to
portray himself as a firm leader attacking fellow communists
dithering about how to handle the economic and political crisis.
   Since last fall, Belgrade journalists say, Milosevic has moved
to bring key Serbian newspapers, and the television and radio under
his sway. The Communist Party daily, Politika, is full of emotional
writing on Kosovo in almost every issue.
   Detractors, particularly in liberal Slovenia, often portray
Milosevic as a hardliner who wants to impose firmer one-party rule
in a country where the communists have lost much of their authority
in an economic crisis that has sent inflation spiraling over 200
percent.
   However, the Serbian party chief has taken on board many
liberalizing economic reforms outlined in the ``Memorandum,'' a
document prepared by Serbian intellectuals in 1986 and officially
denounced by the communists at that time.
   An English speaker, Milosevic is married with a son and a
daughter.

   Diplomats left weekend talks still
laboring to agree on a timetable for withdrawing Cuban troops from
Angola, according to Cuban and Angolan envoys involved in the
negotiations.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada of Cuba and
Angolan U.N. Ambassador Manuel Pedro Pacavira told reporters Monday
that negotiators reached no breakthrough in New York on a timetable
for pulling out 50,000 Cuban troops.
   ``At this meeting, there was no agreement whatsoever,'' Alarcon
said.
   Earlier news reports quoted U.S. officials as saying Cuba,
Angola, South Africa and the United States had agreed to a
withdrawal of Cuban forces within 24 to 30 months.
   However, a U.S. official in Washington told The Associated Press
on Monday the sides had only ``substantially narrowed''
disagreements on a timetable.
   While no final deal was struck in New York, Cuban officials
suggested they were willing to step up the pace of withdrawal from
the 2,000 soldiers a month they had proposed, said U.S. officials
in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In New York, Pacavira said negotiators were still split over
proposals for a 24-month or a 30-month timetable.
   ``Up to now, at the negotiating table, there is a proposal from
the mediator (the United States) that was accepted by the South
African delegation for 24 months,'' said Pacavira.
   However, he said the Angolan-Cuban delegation considers the
proposal only ``a basis for discussion because our proposal is 30
months, and we consider that the last limit of our concessions.''
   He said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month ago in a
meeting in Brazzaville, Congo. All three previous rounds of talks
have been mediated by Chester Crocker, U.S. secretary of state for
African affairs.
   South Africa has linked its scheduled Nov. 1 implementation of a
one-year independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia, to the Cuban troop withdrawal. Pretoria, which
withdrew its troops from Angola earlier this year, says the Cubans
threaten the independence of the territory, which borders Angola.
   Diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working
toward reaching agreement on a Cuban withdrawal timetable at a
formal meeting to be held sometime later this month in the Congo.
   However, U.S. officials said Monday it may not be possible to
reach the Nov. 1 deadline set by the United Nations for transition
to independence for South-West Africa.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   RAPE VICTIM
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may bar publication or
broadcast of a rape victim's name that reporters get from law
enforcement officials.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a weekly Florida
newspaper ordered to pay $97,500 to a rape victim for what the
paper said was inadvertent publication of her name.
   Lawyers for The Florida Star, a newspaper primarily serving the
black community in Jacksonville, said it will be put out of
business if forced to pay the award.
   The case is The Florida Star vs. B.J.F., 87-329.
   
   MIRANDA
   
   The court agreed to decide whether police violate a suspect's
rights when they fail to recite the precise words familiar to every
fan of TV cop shows _ the famous Miranda warnings.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Indiana officials
seeking to reinstate a conviction for attempted murder. A lower
court said the suspect's rights were violated when police strayed
from the exact wording of the Miranda warnings.
   The case is Duckworth vs. Eagan, 88-317.
   
   SMOKESTACKS
   
   The court rejected industry challenges to federal environmental
rules governing the use of high smokestacks to disperse air
pollution.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that
strengthens clean air regulations by limiting the use of
smokestacks as a substitute for other pollution controls.
   The cases are Alabama Power Co. vs. Thomas, 87-2068; Ohio Power
Co. vs. Thomas, 88-60; and National Coal Association vs. NRDC,
88-61.
   
   BOEING
   
   The court refused to kill a lawsuit charging the Boeing Company
with illegal age bias because it bars pilots from active flight
status when they reach 60.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reinstated
the suit.
   The case is Boeing vs. EEOC, 88-53.
   
   CBS
   
   The court refused to revive a challenge to the way Laurence A.
Tisch became president of CBS Inc.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Tisch's
assumption of power did not amount to a transfer of control
requiring prior approval by the Federal Communications Commission.
   The case is Fairness in media vs. FCC, 88-388.
   
   LEGAL FEES
   
   The court agreed to review the award of more than $4 million in
fees to lawyers who won a Kansas City school desegregation lawsuit.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Missouri officials who
want to reduce the amount.
   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-64.
   
   PRIVATE CLUB
   
   The court allowed California officials to block a private club's
beach-front development unless the club vows not to discriminate
against minorities and women.
   The court, citing a lack of a substantial federal issue,
rejected arguments that the anti-bias requirement violates club
members' right to associate with whom they please.
   The case is Jonathan Club vs. California Coastal Commission,
88-179.
   
   BASEBALL PLAYER
   
   The court turned down an appeal by former New York Yankees
pitcher Art Ditmar who was mistakenly identified in a beer
commercial as having surrendered a famous World Series homerun .
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, let stand a ruling
that wrongly being branded a ``gopher ball'' pitcher generally is
not a serious enough matter to sustain a libel lawsuit.
   The case is Ditmar vs. Needham, Harper, 88-405.
   
   DOWN'S SYNDROME
   
   The court barred a Missouri couple whose child has Down's
Syndrome from suing their doctor for failing to tell them a test
would have revealed the disorder prior to birth.
   The court, without comment, refused to review a ``wrongful
birth'' claim by parents who said they would have chosen abortion
if they knew the child had the disorder.
   The case is Wilson vs. Kuenzi, 88-362.
   
   PLAIN DEALER
   
   The court refused to revive a 16-year-old sex discrimination
case against the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the lawsuit because of delays by the Cleveland Newspaper Guild and
others in pursuing the case.
   The case is Cleveland Newspaper Guild vs. Plain Dealer, 87-1864.
   
   ACHILLE LAURO
   
   The court agreed to hear a case involving damage suits brought
against the owners of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro as a
result of a 1985 PLO hijacking in which American passenger Leon
Klinghoffer was killed.
   The question brought before the court is whether American courts
must respect a provision printed on the line's passenger tickets
that require ``any controversy'' to be heard before courts in
Naples.
   The case is Lauro Lines vs. Chasser, 88-23.

   Members of the law faculty at the

Kenyan colleague for his alleged links to recent student
demonstrations.
   Shadrack Gutto, who was given 48 hours by immigration
authorities to leave Zimbabwe, flew to London on Friday.
   No official reasons were given for the expulsion of Gutto, who
allegedly fanned campus unrest against government corruption that
earlier this month led to the bloodiest riots in Zimbabwe since it
won independence from Britain in 1980.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide
whether police violate a suspect's rights when they fail to recite
the precise words familiar to every fan of TV cop shows _ the
famous Miranda warnings.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Indiana officials
seeking to reinstate a conviction for attempted murder. A lower
court said the suspect's rights were violated when police strayed
from the exact wording of the Miranda warnings.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Florida whether states may bar
publication or broadcast of a rape victim's name reporters get from
law enforcement officials.
   _Agreed to decide whether U.S. courts have authority over damage
suits against owners of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. The
suits stem from a 1985 hijacking in which American passenger Leon
Klinghoffer was killed.
   _Rejected industry challenges to federal environmental rules
governing the use of high smokestacks to disperse air pollutants.
   _Refused to kill a lawsuit charging Boeing Company with illegal
age discrimination because it bars its pilots from active flight
status when they reach 60.
   _Rejected an appeal by former major league pitcher Art Ditmar,
who said his reputation suffered from a beer commercial that
mistakenly identified him as the man who gave up a decisive World
Series homer.
   In the Miranda warnings case, the court will hear arguments by
Indiana officials that there should not be ``overly simplistic
reliance upon the use of `magic words' to inform a defendant of his
rights.''
   The case involves Gary Eagan, who was sentenced to 35 years in
prison for attempted murder.
   Eagan telephoned Chicago police on May 16, 1982 and told them he
found a dead naked woman along the shore of Lake Michigan in
Indiana.
   When he led police there, the woman was still alive and upon
seeing Eagan exclaimed, ``Why did you stab me?''
   She later testified she was was picked up by Eagan and some
companions in South Chicago, was taken to the beach and had sexual
relations with several of the men. When she refused Eagan, she said
he stabbed her.
   Chicago police had turned over the case to police in Hammond,
Ind. At the station house there, Eagan signed a police form that
included this paragraph:
   ``You have this right to the advice and presence of a lawyer
even if you cannot afford to hire one. We have no way of giving you
a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and
when you go to court.''
   Eagan subsequently confessed to attempted murder. But the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the wording of the police
form was ambiguous and misleading and violated the rights protected
by the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda ruling.
   The Miranda warnings, usually carried on a wallet-size card by
police officers, advises people under arrest that they have the
right to remain silent and that anything they say can be used
against them in court.
   The suspect also is told, ``You have the right to the presence
of an attorney to assist you prior to questioning, and to be with
you during questioning if you so desire. If you cannot afford an
attorney you have the right to have an attorney appointed for you
prior to questioning.''
   The Indiana attorney general's office said, ``Surely Miranda is
not a ritual of words to be recited by rote according to didactic
niceties. What Miranda does require is meaningful advice to the
unlettered and unlearned in language which he can comprehend and on
which he can knowingly act.''
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of South
Carolina murderer Demetrius Gathers, convicted of a 1986 killing in
Charleston.
   _Said it will consider reducing the award of more than $4
million in legal fees to lawyers who won a Kansas City school
desegregation suit.
   _Agreed to hear an appeal by mining companies seeking to revive
a cap on the royalties they must pay to help finance schools in
Arizona.
   _Barred a Missouri couple whose child has Down's Syndrome from
suing their doctor for failing to tell them a test would have
revealed the disorder prior to birth.
   _Refused to revive a challenge to the way Laurence A. Tisch
became president of CBS Inc. A lower court said Tisch's assumption
of power did not require approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.

   CBS anchorman Dan Rather said Tuesday he has
declined an invitation to be a panelist in Thursday's presidential
debate, saying he would rather report on it than participate in it.
   In refusing to join the debate panel, Rather becomes the only
network anchor not to participate in the nationally televised
election encounters.
   ABC's Peter Jennings served as a panelist in the Sept. 25 clash
between Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and vice president
George Bush. NBC's Tom Brokaw asked questions of vice presidential
candidates Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle on Oct. 5.
   ``I prefer to report on the process than participate in it,''
Rather said in a statement.
   In covering those two previous events, Rather has gone out of
his way on CBS to refer to them as ``joint campaign appearances''
and not debates. In his statement, Rather said the debate format
was ``not the best.'' He did not elaborate.

   Emperor Hirohito was resting in stable condition
Tuesday and asked about the date for his autumn moon-viewing,
officials at the Imperial Palace said.
   The ``Juusan-ya,'' the traditional night for viewing a nearly
full autumn moon, falls on Oct. 23.
   Physicians stepped up blood transfusions to the 87-year-old
monarch after signs that his intestinal bleeding was continuing.
The palace said the transfusions were to combat Hirohito's
continuing anemia.
   ``Even the court physicians say they aren't sure why His
Majesty's anemia hasn't improved despite all the transfusions,''
palace spokesman Shoichi Fujimori told a news conference.
   Also Tuesday, the palace announced that Prince Hiro, Hirohito's
28-year-old grandson, would attend Saturday's opening of the annual
Autumn National Sports Festival in Kyoto in place of Crown Prince
Akihito.
   The emperor, the world's longest-reigning monarch, customarily
attends the opening ceremonies. Akihito represented his father at
last year's sports meet in Okinawa while Hirohito recuperated from
intestinal bypass surgery.

   A floating crane on Tuesday raised the

worst oilfield disaster.
   The 180-ton structure provided accommodations for 33 workers on
the Piper Alpha, which was torn apart by gas explosions July 6 and
sank in 150-feet-deep waters, killing 167 men.
   The bodies of the 112 men still missing are believed to be
trapped inside a second 1,100-ton module still lying on the sea
floor, said the rig's American owner, Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   The larger living module is expected to be raised later this
week, said spokesman Alex Blake-Milton.
   Salvage workers are still trying to recover the wreckage of the
rig 120 miles off Scotland's east coast.

   ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' which
premiered last month to criticism that it has too much style and
not enough content, has hired a managing editor.
   Jim Bellows, a former editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner,
served as executive editor of ABC's ``World News Tonight'' after a
1981-1983 stint as managing editor of ``Entertainment Tonight.''
For the past two years, he has been an executive with Prodigy, a
home computer information service.
   Grant Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, his joint
production venture with Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, the
newspaper, called Bellows ``exactly the right person'' to oversee
the content of the nationally syndicated newsmagazine.
   Despite rumors that the show would be dropped because of
disappointing ratings, Tinker said the addition of Bellows along
with recent format changes give him ``every confidence that `USA
Today: The Television Show' is well on its way to a long and happy
future.''

<HEAD>Bush Played Minor Role in Iran-Contra Affair, Book Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush had only a minor
role in the Iran-Contra affair, but the Iranians were convinced he
was the mastermind behind the weapons deal, a former government
consultant says in a new book.
   ``So far as I can tell, and so far as the available documents
show, Bush was not a major participant in the Iran-Contra affair,
and efforts to drag him into it in some way or other seem to be
forced,'' Michael A. Ledeen, a former consultant to the National
Security Council, writes in ``Perilous Statecraft: An Insider's
Account of the Iran-Contra Affair.''
   ``Bush was a loyal vice president, supporting (President)
Reagan's policy,'' Ledeen writes.
   But the book says that the Iranians had a different view of Bush
and even had a code-name for the vice president: ``Battri.'' That
derived from the best-selling automobile battery in Iran, called
the Busch.
   Ledeen writes that the Iranians thought Bush was the ``most
powerful man in the world, hence the man pulling the strings on the
Iran initiative.''
   The Iranians' view stemmed from the fact that Bush had once
headed the CIA, which the Tehran regime considered the root of
ultimate power in the United States.
   Bush's resignation from the CIA in the mid-1970s was simply a
cover story, the Iranians thought.
   Ledeen knew about the beginnings of the Iran-Contra affair
because he was involved in the earliest efforts to learn more about
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
   U.S. intelligence agencies had huge gaps in their knowledge
about the fundamentalist Khomeini regime, so in May 1985 Ledeen
suggested approaching the Israelis, who were known to have contacts
in Iran. Former NSC adviser Robert McFarlane agreed with that move.
   The meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
ultimately led to the U.S. decision to ship weapons to Iran through
Israel. The Americans hoped the sale would lead to the release of
U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiites in Lebanon.
   By November 1986 when the Iran-Contra affair was exposed, only
three American hostages had been freed while millions of dollars in
profits were secretly diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Among Ledeen's observations:
   _Any deals with the hostages required Khomeini's ``direct
involvement.'' That was because ``th fight between those who
favored hostage release and those who opposed it was so intense
that only the ayatollah could decide.''
   _Former CIA director William Casey ordered the CIA to go all out
to try to find William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut
after Buckley was captured in March 1984 by pro-Iranian terrorists.
Buckley later died in captivity reportedly after being tortured.
   ``Casey informed the president of the situation at regular
intervals, thereby reinforcing Reagan's strong passions about the
Lebanon hostages.'' Casey felt responsible for Buckley's fate
because he had urged the reluctant CIA man to take the job, Ledeen
said.
   _Casey never approved of the secret Iran-Contra operation
masterminded by Oliver L. North, a former NSC aide, according to
Milton Gould, Casey's long-time friend and lawyer quoted in the
book.
   Casey suffered a cerebral seizure in late 1986, shortly after
the Iran-Contra affair was made public, and died from brain cancer
in May 1987.
   _McFarlane was in a psychological crisis in the second half of
1985, more than a year before he tried to commit suicide by taking
a pill overdose.
   ``It was clear that McFarlane was no longer functioning
effectively,'' Ledeen writes. The NSC adviser resigned in November
1985, but within hours ``he was seized with remorse and wished he
had remained to fight to the end.''
   Ledeen denied allegations floated by an Israeli, Amiram Nir,
that he may have had a personal financial stake in shipping weapons
to Iran.
   Nir, an Israeli official who served as a liaison between his
government and the United States, raised that possibility with
North.
   ``It was all nonsense,'' Ledeen wrote. ``I never received a
penny (aside from salary and reimbursement of expenses) as a result
of my work on this project.''

   Babe Ruth drank here, between innings. Bill Veeck
threw his wooden leg across a stool and rhapsodized here for hours.
And future baseball legends, it now appears, will get a chance to
become part of the lore at McCuddy's saloon.
   The tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as
the state clears the area around ancient Comiskey Park for a new
stadium for Chicago's White Sox by 1991.
   But Gov. James R. Thompson has promised that McCuddy's, with a
little help from the state, will rise from those ashes like a
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years _ directly
across the street from Comiskey Park.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Pat Senese, the bar's 65-year-old owner, said
Monday. ``My wife is the third generation of the McCuddy family to
have a stake in this and now we know it'll go on beyond that.
   ``It'll be sad to see the building come down, and besides, we'll
be closed for two years'' during stadium construction, Senese said.
   ``But they tell me it's sitting where the third-base line of the
new one (stadium) will be.
   ``And opening again in two years is better than not opening at
all.''
   The interior of McCuddy's will be all that survives the move.
Thompson said he wanted to save the exterior, but noted there is no
way to build the new stadium and parking lots and still accommodate
McCuddy's during the two-year construction.
   ``It'll have the same feel even if the exterior is new and even
if we're sitting on state-leased land,'' said Senese, who sold his
old parcel of land _ the bar, an adjoining home and two lots _ to
the state for about $235,000.
   ``We'll be across from the park and we'll put a few cracks in
the floor and walls if we have to.''
   McCuddy's has been a Chicago institution since John J. McCuddy
got a tip from a rich and powerful friend named Charles Comiskey.
   Known as the ``Old Roman,'' Comiskey owned Chicago's American
League franchise at the turn of the century, and long harbored
dreams of one day moving from the old wooden ballyard at 39th
Street that was the club's home.
   John J. McCuddy was one of the few people Comiskey let in on the
dream, and McCuddy's opened its doors in time to serve the
construction workers who built Comiskey Park _ dubbed the
``Baseball Palace of the World'' when it opened July 1, 1910.
   ``We've been open for every home game ever since,'' said Senese.
   ``In fact, that's the only time we are open. They have rock
concerts here, soccer games, whatever _ our doors are shut.
   ``This is a baseball joint _ always has been, always will be.''
   So much so that Ruth, legend has it, came across the street
between innings of Yankees-White Sox contests during the mid-1920s
and tipped a few beers before making his way, tipsy sometimes, back
to right field.
   The Babe's visits to McCuddy's would have come right in the
middle of the Prohibition Era, which began in 1920 and lasted until
1933, when Elizabeth ``Toots'' McCuddy headed the family and ran
the tavern.
   But that didn't mean Babe would have had a problem getting a
beer, said Pudi McCuddy, Senese's wife and Elizabeth McCuddy's
daughter.
   ``I know McCuddy's used to serve what they called near beer (a
legal, weaker version of beer) in those days,'' said McCuddy, who
still has the photograph depicting Ruth holding her when she was a
young girl.
   ``But it's also possible the real stuff was available for
special customers as well. Knowing Toots, that would be my guess.
   ``Unfortunately, the only person who would know for sure is my
aunt Frances,'' she added, ``and she died two years ago.''
   ``He was the only guy ever allowed into the place wearing
spikes,'' said Senese. ``He ate everything he could eat and drink
in about three minutes is how my wife tells it. Of course, she was
a little girl then, so we're relying on second-hand information.''
   Yet the day after the White Sox' final home contest this season
_ originally thought to be McCuddy's last stand _ Ruth's daughter
called up Senese and said she wanted to see the place so lovingly
described by the Babe.
   ``People get emotional about this place. Bil Veeck, when he
owned the club, always found time to come in for a beer and he'd
end up sitting for hours. Always had time and a few good stories
for the fans,'' Senese said.
   ``In fact, we've had women bring their infants in and fill up a
thimble with beer _ just so they can say that the little one had
his first one at McCuddy's.''

<HEAD>Culture Clash as Egyptians Watch Kabuki Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptians had their first taste of Japanese
Kabuki theater at the grand opening of Cairo's new Opera House, but
the some who saw the music-and-dance drama found it puzzling and
even funny.
   As solemn-faced Japanese actors in elaborate costume and makeup
told with mournful music and sobbing voices a tragic story of
prisoners exiled on an island, many in Monday night's audience were
cracking up with laughter.
   The haunting wail of the background music and songs in the
hour-long performance was too close to Egyptian wails of mourning.
The stiff, measured movements of the actors were alien to Egyptians
nurtured on free-wheeling, gesticulating emotion in their drama.
   President Hosni Mubarak sat solemn-faced in the presidential box
during the performance and applauded politely at the end. His face
became animated, however, and he tapped his fingers when the
orchestra and chorus struck up a song by Egyptian composer Mohamed
Abdel-Wahab after the Kabuki performance.
   The 50-member Kabuki troupe's performance, the first in the
Middle East, was the first part of the gala inauguration ceremony
for the $50 million neo-Islamic Cairo Education and Culture Center,
the new Opera House.
   Kabuki was included on the program as a tribute to Japan, which
financed and built the sprawling cultural complex.
   Several Egyptians in the plush, rose-colored main auditorium
watched the actors with seeming interest. Many others either sat in
bored resignation or had difficulty hiding their laughter.
   Farid Shawky, a well-known actor in the Egyptian cinema, left
the hall during the performance, apparently unable to contain his
mirth.
   During the intermission, several dignitaries were overheard
saying they found Kabuki a bit hard to take. One said that perhaps
the art, which dates from the 16th century, is an acquired taste.
   The troupe was to give three more performances through Wednesday.
   Although attendance at the inaugural performance was by
invitation only, the whole inaugural was broadcast live on
television and radio.
   ``I am not narrow-minded. I appreciate Western classical music
and music from other cultures. But I just find no rhythm in the
wailing that accompanies Kabuki,'' said Amina Eissa, who watched on
television.
   ``It was just too different from our music and acting,'' said
Heba Kamel, a teacher and another viewer. ``Even after the
announcer explained the story before the show, I found it difficult
to absorb. And it was all so tragic.''
   Two of the government's three channels broadcast the drama. The
third, which normally features a heavy diet of Egyptian soap
operas, was off the air.
   ``We like the Japanese people and it was very nice of them to
give us the opera house, but I didn't like their Kabuki,'' said
Mohamed Said, a garage attendant. ``Then again, I don't think they
would appreciate our music and theater either.''
   Mustafa Hussein, cartoonist for the daily newspaper Al-Akhbar,
depicted on the newspaper's back page Tuesday the reaction of many
Egyptians. His cartoon showed a lawyer in court, with a
terrified-looking young woman sitting in the background. The
lawyer, waving papers, tells the judge:
   ``I demand a divorce for my client on ground of cruelty. These
are medical certificates showing that she had a nervous breakdown
because her husband stood at the bottom of the stairs and performed
Kabuki in front of her.''

<HEAD>Leftist Says Insurgents Would Support Moderate Outcome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Salvadoran leftist leader said Tuesday his
country's guerrilla insurgency would support a political settlement
that guaranteed the continued existence of private industry and a
representative democratic system.
   Ruben Zamora, a member of the Revolutionary Democratic Front,
told reporters the experience of the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua illustrates the dangers of a program of radical reform
and has has a moderating effect on the Salvadoran left.
   ``We have learned a lot from the Nicaraguan experience,'' Zamora
said, alluding to the support the United States has provided to the
Contra rebels.
   ``The U.S. government has the capacity not to defeat a
government like the Sandinistas, but has the capacity to ruin
whatever social and economic programs (a revolutionary government)
has in mind,'' he said.
   Zamora's group has been allied with the FMLN insurgency since
the early 1980s. Under President Jose Napoleon Duarte, El Salvador
has been a major recipient of U.S. assistance because of concern
that a rebel victory would lead to the establishment of another
Soviet foothold in the hemisphere.
   The Reagan administration maintains that the rebels receive
material and other support from Cuba and Nicaragua.
   More than 60,000 Salvadorans have died since the civil war there
erupted in 1980. Zamora said a new ``political dynamic'' now exists
in El Salvador in support of a negotiated settlement.
   Agreements in three basic areas are essential for the fighting
to stop, he said. The first involves agreement on a cease-fire and
the disposition of the ``two armies'' now at war _ the regular army
and the guerrilla army.
   The second, Zamora said, would lay down the rules that guarantee
a pluralistc system and respect for civil liberties and human
rights. Finally, he said, there would be guarantees for private
enterprise, so long as the business community pays taxes, and free
for trade unions to organize.
   Zamora's group, whose initials in Spanish are FDR, boycotted the
1984 national elections but is participating in balloting set for
next March, when a successor to Duarte will be chosen. The ticket
is headed by Guillermo Ungo, a one-time ally of Duarte.
   Zamora said the FMLN rebels have adopted a neutral position
toward FDR participation in the elections. A prime purpose of the
FDR candidates is to rally public support for negotiations to
achieve a political settlement to the civil war, he said.
   He added that the FDR will take part in the elections so long as
its candidates are assured freedom of movement, including security
for its nominees, access to the mass media and fair treatment from
Salvadoran civilian and military authorities.

   Israeli troops on Tuesday
seized the body of a Palestinian teen-ager after mourners at the
funeral began hurling stones to protest his death at the hands of
soldiers.
   In Gaza City, assailants threw a hand grenade from a hospital
and wounded two soldiers, an army spokesman said. It was one of the
few times live weapons have been used against Israelis since the
Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8.
   The Bethlehem disturbance began after a resident of the nearby
Dheishe refugee camp died after being shot in the head with a
plastic bullet during a Sept. 28 clash with troops, Dheishe
residents said. The 18-year-old victim was identified as Nazem Abu
Juda.
   News of Abu Juda's death spread quickly.
   Palestinians keeping watch outside his hospital room took the
body to Dheishe minutes after he died.
   Announcements blared through mosque loudspeakers and called on
residents to participate in funeral services and pay tribute to the
family of the ``martyr.'' The body was hidden from soldiers.
   The army responded by declaring a curfew on Dheishe and closing
all entrances to the camp. But the youth's body already had been
taken out of the camp to Bethlehem.
   When stone-throwing erupted during his funeral, four soldiers
jumped aboard the red van carrying the body at the head of the
procession. Military jeeps pulled up in front and back of the van,
and the soldiers forced the van driver to drive away.
   Dozens of Palestinian youths, some in masks, then called a
strike in the biblical city, demanding that shops close and cars
stay off the roads.
   While they enforced the strike, the youths hurled firebombs at
soldiers, and troops fired rubber bullets and live ammunition in
the air to disperse crowds. At least five Palestinians were
arrested, the army said.
   A military spokesman said one Palestinian was wounded. Arab
witnesses said he was 19 and was shot in the side with a plastic
bullet.
   Abu Juda's death raised to 295 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 10-month rebellion against Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis have died.
   An army spokesman said troops took the body to halt a large
demonstration. He said it would be returned ``at a time when we
know it will not cause disturbances in Bethlehem.'' The driver of
the van was released.
   The hand grenade exploded near the first vehicle in a military
patrol driving through Gaza City, said an army official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The soldiers were hit in the legs by shrapnel and taken to
Barzilai hospital in the nearby Israeli city of Ashkelon. They were
listed in good condition, the spokesman said.
   Other soldiers in the patrol opened fire in the air, the
spokesman said. The army then closed off the area and began
searching for the assailants.
   Also Tuesday, a Palestinian laborer from the Gaza Strip was
killed by an Israeli youth when a fistfight erupted at a
construction site in the central Israeli town of Lod, Israel radio
and police said. Police said the motive appeared to be personal.
   The radio said the 17-year-old Israeli, whose name was not given
because he is a minor, was working on a rooftop with Jamil Shiali,
47, when the two got into an argument. Shiali died after being
punched in the stomach, although the exact cause of death was not
known, it said.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded an 11-year-old boy
during clashes with stone-throwing youths who blocked roads and set
tires ablaze in Khan Yunis, hospital officials said
   Israeli authorities reopened 33 Gaza high schools, allowing
about 20,000 students to return to classes after a prolonged summer
vacation aimed at preventing anti-Israeli activism. All West Bank
schools are closed until Nov. 15.
   The army also decided to put two reserve officers, a captain and
a first lieutenant, on trial on charges of using excessive force
while arresting four Arab stone-throwers in the Gaza Strip town of
Rafah in July, Israel radio said. The army said it was checking the
report.
   The radio said the Palestinians complained that the officers
forced them to stand against a wall while they beat them, and later
threw them on cactuses. It said military police found no evidence
to substantiate the last claim.
   Also Tuesday, Palestinians stoned an Israeli car and a bus in
Arab east Jerusalem's main shopping district, Israel radio
reported. An assailant also hurled a firebomb transporting 37 Arab
workers from the Galilee village of Kafr Kanna to Afula, the radio
said. It said one Arab was injured.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Energy Department has admitted hundreds of
Eastern Bloc and other foreign visitors into its nuclear weapons
labs without required security checks, a Senate hearing was told
Tuesday.
   The visitors included suspected foreign agents and people from
overseas facilities believed to be trying to build nuclear weapons,
according to Keith Fultz of the congressional General Accounting
Office.
   Fultz, who did not identify any of these people, told
Governmental Affairs Committee chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, that
GAO does not believe the three high-level research labs are fully
protected against espionage.
   The visitors, mainly scientists, came from a variety of
communist bloc nations headed by the Soviet Union and China and
nuclear-sensitive nations like Israel, India, South Africa,
Pakistan, Iran and Iraq, he said.
   ``We could not determine if sensitive or classified information
has been lost, but because of ... weaknesses in DOE's foreign
visitor controls, we have little confidence that adequate
protection of weapons-related information and technology is
achieved,'' Fultz said.
   He said that even if no super-secret data were available, the
situation threatens U.S. interests.
   ``DOE studies have concluded that unclassified information at
the laboratories may provide foreign countries details on sensitive
_ and even classified _ activities that the United States
conducts,'' Fultz said.
   Richard Du Val, a deputy assistant energy secretary, said
officials began tightening security a year ago, but he could not
assure chairman Glenn that no foreign visitor was getting into the
labs now without proper screening.
   Fultz detailed the results of a GAO study of foreigners who
between January 1986 and September 1987 visited Los Alamos and
Sandia labs in New Mexico and California's Lawrence Livermore lab,
which is doing work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, sometimes
called the Star Wars program.
   Energy Department security procedures require a background check
in most cases before a lab admits someone from a communist or
nuclear-sensitive nation.
   Fultz said a review of the files on 181 communist-bloc visitors
showed that 176 should have been checked out with the FBI and
intelligence agencies. No checks were done for 119, and only 7
checks were completed before a visit began.
   ``DOE obtained even less background information on visitors from
other sensitive countries,'' said Fultz: 637 visitors, 77
background checks, only 14 completed before the visitor arrived.
   He said that no checks were done on the approximately 10 percent
of the these visitors who are affiliated with organizations on the
department's ``watch list'' because of suspected nuclear weapons
activities.
   Fultz quoted department officials as saying that only one of the
818 visits broached a sensitive topic. ``We found at least 37
others related to inertial confinement fusion and isotope
separation, which are identified as sensitive by DOE.''
   Energy officials say their basic line of defense is security
plans tailored to specific visitors and setting parameters for what
can be discussed and what areas of a lab can be visited.
   Fultz said the labs prepared such plans in only 89 of the 248
visits that fell under this requirement.
   He said that there are problems even when the department knows
about visitors in advance.
   The Energy field office in San Francisco tried to limit a Soviet
official's visit to Livermore to public access areas, but lab
officials allowed the official to spend ``a significant part of
this visit'' in classified areas, according to Fultz.
   And in a recent case, the department officials in Washington
denied two Israelis access to an unidentified lab. One of them got
a lab employee to tap into the lab's unclassified computer from a
terminal in the employee's garage, according to Du Val.
   ``I'm not aware of any other cases like this, but I wouldn't bet
on it,'' Du Val said. ``It's no longer a matter of whether the
visitors are inside the fence.''

   Protesters stayed off the streets
Tuesday after a week of violence that killed more than 400 people,
but the young men who led the revolt against economic hardship
remained angry and impatient.
   Tanks and soldiers guarded areas most affected by the riots,
including Bab-el-Oued, Belcourt and Ruisseau. Helicopter gunships
chuffed overhead.
   Shops were half-open, with metal curtains ready to slam down at
any sign of trouble, and people bought large quantities of staple
foods that had suddenly become available.
   Truck convoys brought flour, butter, semolina and cooking oil
into Algiers during the night and government stores sold the food
to all comers at subsidized prices. Butter that was available only
on the black market last week, at $4.30 a pound, could be had for
$1.75.
   A communique from the president's office announced that the
state of emergency, proclaimed Oct. 6, would be lifted shortly
after dawn Wednesday.
   Government officials said the first official casualty toll
showed 176 people had died as of Sunday night, but they
acknowledged that was lower than the actual number of dead.
   Reports from hospital, medical and police sources indicate at
least 400 were killed and more than 1,000 injured. The French news
agency Agence France-Presse estimated the number of dead at 500 or
more. The government said the reports were exaggerated.
   Thirty-five people, including a correspondent for the official
news agency, were reported killed in an outbreak of violence Monday
night shortly before a speech in which President Chadli Benjedid
promised sweeping reforms.
   Diplomatic and family sources said Sid Ali Benmechiche, a senior
editor of Algerie Presse Service, was hit by machine gun fire while
covering the disturbances in Bab-el-Oued. He was buried quietly
Tuesday in the presence of several foreign reporters.
   The U.S. government denounced the riots and also said the
Algerian government was cooperating in ensuring safety of Americans
there.
   ``We don't believe violence is the appropriate way to achieve
political change in any country,'' State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said in Washingon. ``And we continue our close
cooperation with officials from the government of Algeria.''
   Displeasure with the president's television address was
widespread despite vigorous government efforts to drum up support.
It was his first official comment since riots over over high prices
and food shortages began last week.
   The official news agency, newspapers, radio and television
carried many reports of messages supporting Benjedid flowing in
from outlying districts, such as ``enthusiastic support'' and ``the
women declare their backing.''
   His speech promised far-reaching economic and political change,
but contained few specifics to cool the anger.
   ``It's all very well to promise changes, but we want to know
what he's doing to get more and cheaper goods on the market _ and
quickly,'' said Mohamed Belaid, a university student.
   Similar views were expressed Tuesday wherever groups of young
men gathered to discuss the situation and the president's speech.
   Islamic fundamentalists who tried to take over the revolt at the
end of last week seemed to be left temporarily without a cause, but
one declared while leaning against a tree outside the main post
office:
   ``Just give us a little time. If nothing else happens, give us
at least until prayers next Friday. Then you'll see something.''
   Information Minister Bachir Rouis, in an interview broadcast by
Monte Carlo rado, expressed more optimism:
   ``The political reform announced by President Chadli will go in
the direction of a larger democratic participation by all
Algerians. It is not excluded that we will see other political
concepts than the single party system. There will certainly be
amendments to the constitution.''
   Rouis said he was ``extremely optimistic'' that the crisis would
be resolved.

<HEAD>Comic-Ventriloquist Wayland Flowers Dies of Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ventriloquist Wayland Flowers, who brought
life to a cackling, off-color puppet named Madame, died of cancer
Tuesday, five weeks after collapsing on stage, his publicist said.
He was 48.
   Flowers died at 12:48 a.m., said publicist JoAnne Geffen. No
funeral was planned, but private memorial services in Los Angeles
and his hometown of Dawson, Ga., were being discussed, she said.
   Flowers collapsed Sept. 2 on stage during a performance at
Harrah's resort in Lake Tahoe. Several days later, he was flown by
air ambulance to Georgia to spend some time with his family, Ms.
Geffen said.
   It was unknown when he returned to Los Angeles.
   Flowers had suffered from cancer for some time, she said,
declining elaboration. The family asked that no other details about
his death be released, she said.
   The puppeteer created a cast of characters, but it was the
craggy old hussy Madame, manipulated with rods rather than strings,
that launched the popularity of the television and showroom act.
   Wayland & Madame's first big break came on ``The Andy Williams
Show'' and led to guest appearances on the reincarnated
``Laugh-In,'' ``Hollywood Squares'' and a four-year stint on
``Solid Gold.''
   Their own syndicated situation comedy ``Madame's Place'' was
shown in 1982.
   ``This was an underground act that took root and shot up out of
nowhere,'' Flowers once said in an interview, adding: ``I'm an
illusionist. I'm right out there on stage beside Madame, but within
two or three minutes it seems that I disappear.''
   Flowers also brought life to such characters as Crazy Marv, who
had terribly accurate observations on humanity, Jiffy from Harlem
with humor and song stylings, vaudevillian Mr. Mackelhoney and Baby
Smedley's high chair view of the world.
   Flowers, whose full name was Wayland Parrott Flowers, leaves a
sister, brother, and aunt.

<TEXT>
   A laboratory inside a nuclear complex in
northwestern England has been contaminated with plutonium, the
plant's operator said Tuesday.
   Above-normal traces of radioactivity were detected Monday on the
floor of an analytical laboratory handling plutonium at the
Sellafield nuclear plant and in a small area of the corridor
outside, said a spokesman for British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. who
requested anonymity.
   No workers at the plant, about 260 miles northwest of London in
Cumbria, have been exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity nor
has there been a release into the environment, the spokesman said.
   The Sellafield complex is the world's largest nuclear
reprocessing center, extracting uranium and plutonium from spent
nuclear fuel used by reactors in Britain and other countries.
   The Irish government and environmental groups have repeatedly
criticized the plant's discharge of radioactive waste into the
Irish Sea as a health hazard and have demanded the plant's closure.
   The company says its discharges and leaks have been within safe
limits.

<HEAD>Teachers Strike After School Board Says It Can't Afford Raises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers in Arkansas' second-largest
school district went on strike Tuesday after the Board of Education
said it could not afford a 3 percent pay hike.
   Classes were canceled for 20,000 students in the Pulaski County
School District, which includes all schools in the county except
those in Little Rock and North Little Rock.
   Elsewhere, teachers strikes in Pennsylvania, Illinois and
Michigan disrupted classes for 14,000 students.
   Pulaski County teachers walked off the job after the school
board Monday night refused to act on the union's demand for a 3
percent raise, as recommended by a mediation committee. Their
average salary is currently $23,349.
   ``We are very disappointed with the decisions that have brought
us to this point,'' Dan McElderry, spokesman for the Pulaski
Association of Classroom Teachers, said as teachers gathered before
sunrise for a rally.
   ``We'd much rather be in the classroom, doing what we've been
trained to do,'' said McElderry, chairman of PACT's Crisis
Committee.
   Following the rally, teachers began picketing peacefully at
district schools. There were no incidents, the sheriff's department
said.
   Board President Sheryl Dunn said she was extremely disappointed
at the strike. ``We tried so hard to come to a point that we could
agree on something to find the money for the teachers,'' she said.
``They just won't wait, and all I can say is how desperately sorry
I am.''
   The Pulaski School Board voted 4-3 to reopen negotiations if
money becomes available for raises. The board, in effect, rejected
the teachers' demand by failing to act on it. The union, which
represents 1,000 of the district's 1,300 teachers, voted last week
to strike if the recommended pay increase was rejected.
   Gary Miller, the administration's chief negotiator, told the
board that without raises, the district would have a $1.9 million
deficit unless it receives $2.5 million it contends it had been
underpaid by the state as part of a desegregation case. The money
is tied up in federal litigation. The raise sought by the teachers
would cost about $1 million.
   Elsewhere, 600 teachers and 10,000 students were affected by
strikes in five Pennsylvania districts. In the Spring-Ford
district, a walkout resumed Tuesday after a 30-day cooling-off
period. That strike affected 200 teachers and 3,300 students.
   Illinois had one strike affecting 65 teachers and 1,000
students, while Michigan had one strike affecting 150 teachers and
3,000 students.

<HEAD>NBC Adds New Shows To Top 10; ABC Rained Out Of No. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rainout of a National League playoff game
lowered ABC's score in the Nielsen television ratings last week and
gave NBC an unexpected win for the week.
   For the week ending Oct. 9, NBC had a 15.0 rating, ABC had 13.4
and CBS 12.4, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. NBC had expected to
lose the week because of the baseball playoffs on ABC. But Game 3
in the National League faceoff between the New York Mets and Los
Angeles Dodgers was rained out Friday.
   NBC's premiere of ``Empty Nest,'' nestled behind the hit
``Golden Girls'' on Saturday, and a preview of ``Dear John''
enveloped by the NBC Thursday hit lineup, both landed in the top 10.
   The season premiere of ``The Cosby Show'' was No. 1, though it
had a considerably lower rating and share than its premiere last
season _ 24.2 and a 40 share, compared to a 31.5 and 51 share last
year.
   Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects,
attributed the ``Cosby'' number to competition from ABC's American
League game between the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland A's. He said
NBC was not surprised by the lower number anyway, having predicted
that the hit sitcom would slide in the ratings in this, its fifth
season.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``A Different World,'' ``Golden
Girls,'' ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John,'' all NBC; ``Jesse,'' a
CBS Tuesday movie; and _ all tied at eighth _ ``ALF,'' ``Tonight
Show 26th Anniversary'' and ``The Hogan Family'' on NBC, plus CBS'
``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
   CBS won the battle of the Sunday movies with its version of the
Liberace story, ``Liberace: Behind the Music,'' which was 14th in
the Nielsens, ahead of NBC's ``Going to the Chapel'' at 21st.
   ABC ran its Liberace movie, ``Liberace,'' a week earlier.
Apparently, there was enough interest in the life of the flamboyant
entertainer to support the two made-for-TV movies. They got almost
identical ratings: ABC's version scored a 16.8, CBS' 16.6.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 homes with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   In news, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' managed a close second
despite pre-emptions on the West Coast by baseball. But the ``CBS
Evening News'' won the week with a 10.2 rating and 20 share. ABC
had a 9.9 and 21 share (indicating a larger percentage of a smaller
audience). ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.6 and 20 share.
   NBC's Olympics coverage sputtered to a close with the ``Summer
Olympics Review'' ranked 47th with an 8.7 rating and 14 share.
   It was just above the lowest-rated shows of the week:
``Incredible Sunday,'' ``American League Championship Pre-game 3,''
``National League Championship Pre-game 3,'' ``Full House,'' ``Bugs
Bunny Specials,'' ``Cavanaughs,'' ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``Simon &
Simon'' and ``Live! Dick Clark Presents.''

<DATELINE>TRURO, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain driven by gale-force winds brought
heavy flooding Tuesday to southwestern England, leaving the center
of this catherdral city of 14,000 people awash in 4 feet of water,
police said.
   The downpour that began Monday night dumped more than 2 inches
of rain in two hours on the Cornwall peninsula, said a spokesman
for the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary who requested anonymity.
   Hardest hit was Truro, the administrative center of Cornwall,
about 300 miles west of London.
   Shopkeepers were evacuated from the low-lying areas downtown as
emergency workers sandbagged the perimeter of the area to prevent
the rising water from spilling into residential neighborhoods, the
spokesman said.
   Other flooded areas included the nearby villages of Carnon
Downs, Feock, Devoran and St. Just-in-Roseland. Roads to the
seaside resort of St. Agnes were cut off by floodwaters aggravated
by rising tides, the spokesman said.
   Main roads into the Truro area lay under 6 feet of water in some
places, the spokesman said, while the River Kenwyn near Truro
appeared in danger of spilling its banks.
   About 50 families across the barren, rugged Cornish peninsula
had been evacuated, the spokesman said.
   A spokesman for the London Weather Center said an Atlantic
weather depression spawned the rains and accompanying 35-45 mph
winds gusting up to 65 mph.
   The high winds stranded 400 people bound for Cork, Ireland, at
the dock in Swansea, Wales, for 10 hours as the ferry Celtic Pride
was forced to ride out the storm at anchor in Swansea Bay, the
domestic news agency Press Association reported.

<HEAD>Police Mount Nationwide Hunt For Seven Escaped Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50,000 police combed residential
and entertainment districts Tuesday for seven escaped prisoners who
held a family hostage for 26 hours.
   Police said the search extended nationwide for the seven, last
seen early Monday when they left the home of a Seoul pharmacist
where they had burst in a day earlier brandishing knives and a
pistol.
   The Home Ministry ordered neighborhood associations in Seoul and
the adjacent province of Kyonggi to hold their monthly meetings
Tuesday night, two weeks earlier than usual, to seek their
cooperation in tracking down the fugitives.
   They were among 12 prisoners who opened their handcuffs with a
makeshift key while en route to provincial prisons Saturday,
overpowered their guards, and forced the prison bus back to Seoul.
They tied up the 11 guards and fled, taking the pistol and five
cartridges.
   Five of the prisoners are back in custody, including three
captured Sunday after a saloon owner tipped police that suspicious
men were at his bar.
   Police officials said at least 50,000 of the nation's 120,000
troopers had been pressed into the search for the others, who
reportedly had talked of revenge against the saloon owner.
   Sohn Byung-nok, the pharmacist who was held hostage, also said
he heard the fugitives discussing a robbery raid in a high-class
residential area.
   Sohn said the seven had wanted to stay longer in his home, but
left in two groups when his 23-year-old daughter told them she had
to attend college courses Monday.
   ``We were terrified during the 26 hours,'' said Sohn, 51, whose
home was invaded at 2:30 a.m. Sunday when he, his wife, two
children, a cousin and an employee of his shop were sleeping.
   Newspapers reported that one of the seven telephoned the
Yongdungpo Prison, where the three recaptured prisoners were held,
and was allowed to talk to one of them. He told the prisoner that
he had seized a car and would use it for one raid before deciding
whether to surrender, the reports said.
   The seven each had been sentenced to prison terms of seven years
or more for murder, armed robbery or rape. They had been awaiting
the results of appeals to the Supreme Court.
   The 11 prison bus guards were under investigation for negligence.

   They were never in a league by
themselves, and their alley romance left them close to the gutter.
   In the end, J.R. Rose, 36, and Charlene Blakely, 38, said ``I
do'' between lanes 19 and 20 in a bowling alley.
   Kona Lanes turned into lovers' lane Sunday when the rumbling of
bowling balls and the crashing of pins stopped after an employee
announced: ``Hold up on your play; we'll turn the lanes on when the
ceremony is over.''
   ``We met in the league. It took me a few weeks to get the nerve
to ask her out,'' said Rose, who has been bowling for 20 years.
   ``This place is special to us, and J.R. is very romantic,'' said
Miss Blakely, who started bowling a short while before she met Rose.
   Rose's league buddy Gary Lewan, a minister with the Universal
Life Church, officiated.
   The couple were dressed in identical league pants and shoes, but
Miss Blakely wore a frilly silk blouse. After the two exchanged
vows, the bride removed the blouse to reveal a bowling shirt
underneath with her new name, Charlene Rose, on the back.
   Instead of asking Rose to kiss his bride, Lewan said: ``The
couple will consummate their marriage by rolling the bowling balls
down the alley.''
   He left two pins standing, she left five. The reception took
place after the newlyweds bowled in their usual Sunday league games.

   Below a stained glass portrait of George
Washington at the University of Washington is an elegant Latin
inscription: ``Num Me Vexo?''
   Translated, that means ``What, me worry?''
   Readers of Mad Magazine recognize that as the slogan of the
gooney grinning character Alfred E. Neuman.
   The inscription is at the university's south campus center, near
the bookstore. So far, there are no indications of who pulled off
the joke, and time could be on the perpetrator's side. The window
has been there about 13 years.
   The window attracted attention recently when it was mentioned in
a weekly newspaper as the most unusual Latin inscription in
Seattle. The university newsletter ran an item asking faculty and
staff for the story behind the window.
   University spokesman Bob Roseth said he has not received any
response. University historian Solomon Katz said he first learned
of the window inscription in the newsletter.
   Tom Griffin, the Newsletter's editor, said his staff was looking
through building records.

<HEAD>NBC's Tartikoff Signs Long-Term Deal to Stay at Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff,
who had been rumored to be fielding offers from movie studios, will
remain at NBC with expanded duties as chairman of a new program
development division, Tartikoff and NBC President Robert C. Wright
announced Tuesday.
   ``Several different jobs were offered to me, major studio
executive situations, independent production deals, but a few weeks
ago both Jack (GE Chairman Jack Welch) and Bob (Wright) met with me
and made a very generous offer for me to continue on at NBC,''
Tartikoff said in a statement close-circuited to network affiliates
from NBC headquarters in New York.
   Wright called Tartikoff ``simply the best.''
   ``His decision to remain with NBC is exceptionally good news for
NBC's advertisers, for our affiliates, for our employees and for
America's viewers,'' said Wright.
   Tartikoff has been head of the entertainment division since 1980
and has held the job longer than anyone in television. NBC had
never won a season before taking the top spot four seasons ago and
it has been No. 1 ever since, a feat credited to Tartikoff's
programming ability and eye for new talent.
   Tartikoff will be chairman of a new NBC Program Development
Group, which includes NBC News President Michael Gartner and Sports
President Arthur Watson, plus the heads of NBC productions,
business affairs, the station group and the network. Tartikoff will
also oversee advertising and promotion.
   Tartikoff said details about program development would probably
be revealed later this month, but said the new ``Later with Bob
Costas'' show was an example of the type of cooperative programming
the group might develop. ``Later'' is an entertainment talk show,
but Costas came from NBC Sports.
   Tartikoff said he felt the deal he was offered _ there were no
details released except that the contract extends ``into the
1990s'' _ represented a commitment by NBC's corporate owner, GE, to
``the future of free, over-the-air television.''

<HEAD>FAA Recommends Safety Improvements at Chicago Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some flights should be rerouted to reduce
congestion and the potential for errors by air traffic controllers
at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, a Federal Aviation
Administration report says.
   The FAA also should offer higher pay and other incentives to
attract experienced controllers to O'Hare and should improve their
crowded facilities and old equipment, said y
prepared for the agency.
   The congestion in Chicago's skies also drew attention Tuesday
from American Airlines, which asked the FAA to limit flights at all
three of than internal stude city's airports.
   The FAA report, not yet released, recommends 80 steps for
improving operations and safety at O'Hare, the nation's busiest
airport. The proposals resulted from a month-long investigation
into the large number of flight-handling errors there.
   There have been 30 controller errors so far this year in the
Chicago area, which includes O'Hare, Midway Airport and several
satellite airfields, compared with 12 during all of 1987, the
agency said.
   In its report, the FAA said the combination of flights taking
off and landing at O'Hare and traffic from other nearby airports
may be too much for controllers to handle.
   Although the practice of crossing flight paths _ with planes
separated by altiSHIP, N.J. (AP) _ A regulatory board Tuesday gave
unanimous approval to entertainer Merv Griffin's offer to buy
Resorts International Inc., its casinos and property, despite
lingering questions about whether Griffin will complete the deal.
   ``Thank you for the unanimous vote,'' Griffin told the Casino
Control Commission after its ruling. ``It was a vote of
confidence.''
   The commission's decision came a day after Griffin's company
announced it had allowed a deadline for its $36-per-share tender
offer to Resorts' stockholders to expire. The move gave rise to
speculation that Griffin was trying to back out of the deal.
   It also drove down the price of Resorts stock by $4.875 Monday
to $29.125.
   Griffin told reporters after the ruling that the speculation was
``ridiculous,'' but that allowing the deadline to expire was
designed to allow him to get out of the deal if conditions were not
favorable.
   ``It gives me the right to continue on and close (the deal) as
quickly as I can,'' he said. ``It gives me a chance to leave it if
all things aren't in place.
   ``I want to be able to stay very fluid and to be able to make a
businessman's decision, and to walk if everything is not done,''
Griffin added.
   Under the deal, Griffin would purchase Resorts' stock, including
that owned by billionaire developer Donald Trump. Griffin would
take control of the Resorts International Casino Hotel, Resorts'
vast land holdings in Atlantic City, and a casino and property
Resorts owns in the Bahamas.
   Trump would purchase from Resorts its unfinished, 1,250-room Taj
Majal casino next door to Resorts' gaming hall on the Boardwalk in
Atlantic City.
   Griffin is still awaiting approval from the Bahamian government
on his request to purchase Resorts' property there. The commission
has not yet acted on his request for a permanent casino license,
although it granted him a 90-day license Tuesday.
   His attorney, Howard Goldberg, assured the commission that
Griffin wasn't pulling out of the sale.
   ``I hate to paraphrase Mark Twain,'' he said, ``but the rumors
about the death of this deal are greatly exaggerated.''
   Goldberg said the refusal to extend the tender offer gives
Griffin ``flexibility'' to reconsider the deal if market conditions
take a downward slide or if Griffin fails to get approvals he is
waiting for.
   Robert Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization
and the brother of Donald, said he was confused by Griffin's
announcement.
   ``We didn't quite understand it,'' he said.
   ``I read and re-read the (Griffin news) releases and I don't
know what they mean,'' said Joel Sterns, an attorney for Resorts.
   Reading from a prepared text, Griffin said if an acquisition is
completed, it would be done through a merger, not a tender offer.
   A merger offer was approved Aug. 30 by the required number of
shareholders, said Griffin.
   Griffin, who recently has turned his attention to real estate,
would take the company private by buying out Trump's controlling
stock and all remaining shares.
   Griffin and Trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control
of Resorts, but appeared to have come to terms about their
differences and worked out the deal now in question.
   Griffin has offered to pay Trump $135 a share, or $96 million,
for Trump's Class B stock. Trump also would receive another $63
million from Griffin to break Trump's management contract with
Resorts.
   Griffin's tender offer for Class A stockholders would cost him
$205.2 million. Griffin would also invest $50 million in Resorts to
help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest payments on
Resorts' debt.
   In turn, Trump would pay Resorts $273 million for the Taj Mahal.

   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees Tuesday
increased its 1988 budget by $43 million to help the world's 12
million refugees, the head of the agency said.
   Jean-Pierre Hocke said the 1988 target budget of $420 million,
up from the original $377 million, was approved by the agency's
Executive Committee at a meeting on Monday. Hocke said the High
Commission was about $100 million short of funding the new budget.
   The 43-nation committee also targeted $428.7 million for the
1989 budget.
   In 1988, the High Commission allocated the most money _ $46.3
million _ for refugees in Pakistan, followed by $42.9 million for
those in Sudan and $37.6 million in Somalia.
   Hocke told reporters that in Africa alone, the number of
refugees increased by 1 million in the past 12 months because of
the flow of refugees into Malawi and Ethiopia.
   He noted the Geneva peace accord aimed at ending the war in
Afghanistan, the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and the positive
prospects for peace in Namibia and Angola, favored the world's
refugees.
   ``If everything goes well, about half of the world's refugees
will have benefited from solutions within several years,'' either
by repatriation or resettlement, Hocke said.
   He said 75 percent of the world's 12 million refugees are women
and children under the age of 16.

   Further discussions with the Soviet Union on a
new long-term grain agreement have been tentatively scheduled to
resume in London later this week, the White House said Tuesday.
   No further details were provided in the brief statement by Alan
F. Holmer, deputy trade representative, who leads U.S. negotiators.
The meetings are scheduled for Thursday and Friday, he said.
   The previous 5-year agreement expired on Sept. 30, despite
months of negotiations and informal talks by U.S. and Soviet
officials. One possibility has been a simple extension of the old
pact for a year while negotiators work out details of a new
arrangement.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union has been buying U.S. grain in large
quantities, including an additional 250,000 metric tons announced
Tuesday by the Agriculture Department.
   The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets for delivery in
the 1988-89 corn marketing year that began on Sept. 1 to more than
4.3 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 250,000 tons of
corn would be about 9.85 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.73 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $27 million.
   According to the old agreement, the annual purchases were
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to the round of sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet
Union had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million
tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the
agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of
soybean meal.

<HEAD>Florida English Foes Seek Federal Injunction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of a proposed state constitutional
amendment to make English the state's official language went to
federal court Tuesday to try to knock the measure off the November
ballot.
   ``We are opposed to it,'' said Monsignor Bryan Walsh, a
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami, on the steps
of U.S. District Court. ``We do not think that we have problems in
Florida which merit such a constitutional amendment.''
   He said the diocese was supporting the effort to block Amendment
11.
   A group called Florida English circulated petitions to get the
amendment on the November ballot. If approved, the measure would
require all state business be conducted in English.
   Opponents and supporters of the measure, however, disagree over
what changes would be required under the amendment.
   In their suit, the opponents argue that the petitions circulated
throughout the state were only written in English.
   ``Florida is a state that is extensively populated by persons
whose primary language is not English,'' says the suit, filed on
behalf of four U.S. citizens of Mexican, Cuban and Puerto Rican
descent.
   Citing a U.S. District Court decision in Colorado, the suit
argues that the Voting Right Act of 1965 mandates that the
petitions be circulated in minority languages in counties where
more than 5 percent of the residents speak that language.
   Seven southern Florida counties fall in that category because of
their Spanish-speaking population, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau.
   For example, in Dade County, which includes Miami, 40 percent to
50 percent of the population speaks Spanish as their first language.
   Supporters of the Official English initiative were angered by
the suit.
   ``It's an outrage that people will be deprived of the
opportunity to vote `yes' or `no' on this if the lawsuit
succeeds,'' said Pat Fulton, spokeswoman for Florida English.
   State officials never told them they must circulate petitions in
Spanish, she said, and her group contends the Voting Rights Act
applies to governments, not private organizations.
   ``We will be responding to it on a legal basis,'' she said. ``We
are also asking people to phone their legislator to complain that
they are being disenfranchised if such an injuction is granted.''
   In Tallahassee, Gov. Bob Martinez said he agreed with the
objectives of the suit.
   ``I think it's a known fact to this country we didn't use
English only to assimilate Italian-Americans, German-Americans or
anyone else, and this nation's been doing that for way over a
century,'' Martinez said.
   The suit, filed against Secretary of State Jim Smith and local
elections officials, was assigned to U.S. District Judge James
Kehoe. It seeks an injunction preventing the issue from appearing
on the ballot and preventing the state from counting the votes.
Kehoe is out of town until Monday and no hearing has been set.
   In Colorado, a federal judge recently took that state's
official-English initiative off the ballot because the petitions
were not circulated in Spanish as well as English in Colorado's 12
heavily Hispanic counties.
   That ruling could affect not only other initiatives on this
year's ballot in Colorado, but laws passed by previous initiatives
and 36 initiatives pending in 11 states, according to Steve
Workings of the Washington-based U.S. English.
   Fourteen states have adopted official English proposals to date.

<HEAD>King Files For New Trial In Globe Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for former Gov. Edward J. King filed
a motion for a new trial Tuesday in a libel suit against The Boston
Globe.
   A Suffolk Superior Court jury on Sept. 29 ruled that, while a
1981 Globe column was false, it didn't libel King. In filing his
motion, Robert H. Goldman asks the court to set aside the judgment
and schedule a new trial.
   The column alleged that King had telephoned the judge in a
controversial rape case seeking a tougher sentence. King and the
judge both denied the call ever took place.
   The jury was asked to answer two questions. It agreed that
former Globe columnist David Farrell was wrong when he wrote in a
Nov. 8, 1981, column that King called a judge to demand harsher
sentences in a gang-rape case.
   But the jurors said no when asked if they believed the statement
discredited King. King needed to prevail on each question.
   In his motion, Goldman said, ``The court erred in instructing
the jury that as a matter of law no crime was alleged in the
statement in issue.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven current and former city police detectives
were sentenced Tuesday to federal prison terms ranging from two to
five years for soliciting bribes from restaurant and bar owners.
   They were convicted Sept. 13 of federal charges of conspiring to
extort more than $18,000 in return for protecting the
establishments from inspections, overlooking violations or seeking
to influence liquor cases in court or before the city's Licensing
Board.
   Prosecutors Diane Kottmyer and James Farmer accused the
detectives of selling their badges for influence while defense
attorneys maintained that the detectives were only accepting gifts
from people they worked with closely over several years.
   ``They sold the public trust in return for personal gain,''
Kottmyer said.
   The prosecutors had sought longer sentences, but they said they
were satisfied. ``The message is that police officers, just like
all other citizens, are bound by the constraints of the law.''
   In handing out sentences well below those recommended by
prosecutors, U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone said: ``It's
difficult not to be impressed by their records.''
   All seven defendants remain free on their own recognizance
pending appeals to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The officers were indicted last year following an investigation
of more than six years by the New England Organized Strike Force,
whose last major case was the prosecution of Boston mobster Gennaro
Angiulo.
   The trial lasted more than eight weeks.
   Two defendants also were convicted of 19 and 18 counts of mail
fraud in connection with a scheme to extort $15,000 for a police
detail that they never performed.
   A group of detectives handed out a press release after the
sentencing, saying they had attended the hearing ``to demonstrate
our support for our seven brothers who are the victims of a
terrible injustice by overzealous prosecutors.''

<TEXT>
   An American man broke down in
tears Tuesday as he told a court about his fears for his wife and
daughter during a 1985 TWA hijacking in which a Navy diver was
beaten and killed.
   Leo Byron, testifying at the murder and air piracy trial of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, said Hamadi's alleged accomplice kicked
Byron's 13-year-old daughter and that Hamadi struck other
passengers.
   Byron, 52, also said he saw Navy diver Robert Stethem after the
hijackers had beaten the sailor severely.
   ``His face was puffy. He was very raw or bloody in the neck
area. He appeared to be dazed,'' said Byron. Stethem was later shot
and killed.
   Witnesses' hometowns were not given for security reasons.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days after the
jetliner was commandeered on June 14, 1985 during a Rome-to-Athens
flight and forced to land three times in Beirut and twice in
Algiers.
   Byron sobbed as he told of his terror in not knowing what the
hijackers would do to his daughter, Pam, and his wife.
   ``When my wife and Pam were taken to the back of the plane, I
tried to watch them ... but I didn't see them,'' he said.
   He said he was relieved when his daughter came back to say she
and her mother would be among a group of passengers who were
released in Algiers.
   Byron said that shortly after the hijacking began, the hijackers
ordered passengers to sit in a crouched position. Hamadi then began
striking passengers, Byron said, adding that he was hit on the head
and hands.
   ``The taller hijacker kicked Pam in the shoulder,'' said Byron.
   He also said he heard screams and rhythmic beatings later at the
front of the plane.
   Byron sobbed again as he recalled the shot that mortally wounded
Stethem at Beirut airport.
   ``It was a pop,'' said Byron. ``I'm familiar with guns, so I
knew it was a gunshot.''
   But Byron said he did not see who fired the shot. Hamadi admits
that he was one of the hijackers, but denies killing Stethem.
   Hamadi listened intently to the testimony in the heavily guarded
courtroom inside Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison. Outside the
courthouse, police were on patrol, some with machine guns.
   Earlier Tuesday, another American held captive on the jetliner
testified that Stetham, of Waldorf, Md., was so severely beaten he
could barely walk.
   ``He was mobile, but he was staggering in his walk and was being
supported by (chief flight attendant) Uli Derickson,'' said the
American, Sarah Ashmore, 50.
   ``He was moaning and groaning and Uli was trying to keep him
quiet,'' said Ms. Ashmore, who frequently pressed her hands against
her head during the testimony.
   Ms. Ashmore testified that Hamadi robbed her.
   Looking directly at Hamadi, she said: ``This is the man who
searched me. This is the man who took my jewelry.''
   Court documents indicate the hijackers stole jewelry, cash,
cameras and other valuables from passengers.
   Ms. Ashmore said she had no doubt about the identities of the
two hijackers. ``I spent a long time staring at them.''
   The other alleged hijacker, Hassan Ezzeddine, is still at large.
   Ms. Ashmore also told the court she heard the shot that killed
Stethem.
   ``I heard the shot and the body drop, but I couldn't see
anything,'' she said.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, have attended
each session of the trial, which began July 5.
   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 at Frankfurt airport after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Wells Fargo Trial Opens With Heated Court Exchanges, Call for
Mistrial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key defendant in the $7.1 million Wells
Fargo robbery admitted Tuesday that he agreed before the heist to
accept the money for the Puerto Rican independence movement.
   The revelation by Juan Segarra Palmer came as he and four
co-defendants went on trial in U.S. District Court in Hartford
after more than three years of pretrial proceedings.
   The first day of the trial before a packed court room was
highlighted by surprising disclosures, heated exchanges, a motion
for a mistrial and stern lectures by Judge T. Emmet Clarie.
   The government also called its first witness, a former Wells
Fargo security guard who was tied up during the Sept. 12, 1983,
robbery at the company's West Hartford depot.
   The $7.1 million theft was the second-largest cash robbery in
U.S. history. The only money ever recovered was the torn halves of
a $10 bill.
   In addition to the Segarra, 38, the others standing trial are:
Carolos Ayes Suarez, 29; Norman Ramirez Talavera, 32; Roberto
Maldonado Rivera, 52; and Antonio Comacho Negron, 43, all residents
of Puerto Rico.
   The government contends that all five were members of a group
known as Los Macheteros, which advocates independence for Puerto
Rico and which the government contends is a terrorist organization.
   The defendants are accused of participating in a conspiracy to
plot the heist, to transport the stolen money out of the country
and to distribute the money.
   Both the prosecution and the defense agree that the robbery was
committed singlehandedly by Victor M. Gerena, a former Wells Fargo
security guard. He is accused of overpowering two co-workers and
fleeing with the millions.
   The trial of nine other defendants has been postponed while the
government appeals a ruling tossing out some evidence collected
through wiretaps. Two other defendants pleaded guilty last month.
   ``It took years to perpetrate the offense and it will take
months to prove it,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Albert Dabrowski told
the jury in his opening remarks.
   Segarra's attorney, Leonard Weinglass, said although his client
knew in advance that the heist would occur and received stolen
money, he was innocent of the crimes with which he has been
charged. Segarra faces 17 counts, including robbery, but no charge
of receiving stolen funds.
   Weinglass said Gerena decided on his own to rob Wells Fargo to
support Los Macheteros. Segarra said he was not a member of the
group.
   Gerena has not been seen since the robbery. The government
believes he is probably in Cuba.
   The opening remarks became heated when Maldonado, an attorney
defending himself, said: ``If I'm guilty of all the charges, I
could go to jail for 55 years.''
   The judge told him the remarks were improper. When Maldanado
persisted, the judge said he was ready to cite him for contempt.
   Clarie then got into another exchange with Juan Ramon Acevedo,
who is representing Ramirez. Acevedo said the defense intended to
put the FBI on trial as part of its claim that the defendants are
being prosecuted for political reasons.
   Clarie was visibly angry as he raised his gavel and issued a
warning, saying the remarks were inappropriate.
   The defense later asked for mistrial because of Clarie's remarks
to Acevedo and Maldonado. The judge denied the motion.
   The first witness was Timothy R. Girard, a former Wells Fargo
guard and Gerena's partner. He told the court how Gerena held a gun
to his supervisor's head and ordered Girard to lie on the floor of
the depot.
   Girard said he was bound, gagged and left behind as Gerena took
about an hour to load cash into a car and flee.

   President Reagan said Tuesday that Republicans
have ``a real shot at getting back control of the Senate'' in this
year's elections, which he painted as ``a referendum on
liberalism.''
   In a speech prepared for delivery at a reception for two western
GOP senatorial candidates, Reagan predicted voters will reject
``senators who talk conservative back home but vote liberal in
Washington.''
   His remarks were aimed at Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., who is
opposed by Yellowstone County Commissioner Conrad Burns; and Sen.
Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., facing a challenge from Minority Leader
Earl Strinden of the North Dakota House of Representatives.
   Republicans won control of the Senate with Reagan's election as
president in 1980, but lost it in 1986. Democrats now hold control
by a margin of 54-46.
   Reagan, who has been stepping up the pace of his campaign
activity as the Nov. 8 voting approaches, told the Republican
gathering, ``This is a great time of year because it gives me an
opportunity to get out and around and spread some gospel.''
   ``I've been out on the campaign trail lately and I'm just
starting to wonder if this year there isn't something in the air,''
he said.
   He said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, chairman of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Senate GOP leader Bob
Dole of Kansas deserve ``enormous credit because far from being
discouraged they've realized that with voter interest much higher
in this presidential year there's a real shot at getting back
control of the Senate.''
   ``You see, all the issues we had so much trouble getting out
there in 1986 are automatically there in 1988 _ the public is
beginning to realize that this election is a referendum on
liberalism,'' he said.
   ``And when the good conservative voters of Montana and North
Dakota begin to realize that the opponents of Conrad Burns and Earl
Strinden are nothing less than hard-core liberals _ senators who
talk conservative back home but vote liberal in Washington _ they
are not going to be happy.''
   Reagan flies to Pennsylvania and New Jersey on Wednesday to
campaign for Republican candidates.

   One of several cadets stricken by a
kidney ailment during police training last month re-entered the
hospital Tuesday with intestinal bleeding, officials said.
   Cadet Joseph Metcalfe of Ludlow was in guarded condition at the
intensive care unit following surgery at Baystate Medical Center,
said hospital officials.
   A nursing supervisor said shortly after Metcalfe was admitted,
``He's bleeding heavily and is pretty bad.''
   Also Tuesday, Secretary of Public Safety Charles V. Barry
recommended an inquest into the 1985 death of a state police cadet
after meeting Tuesday with Medical Examiner Brian Blackbourne and
Public Safety Commissioner William McCabe.
   James Whitehouse of Braintree was 22 when he died on the second
day of training at the state police academy in Framingham. A
medical examiner ruled that he died from a genetic disorder, but
the doctor has since called for the state to reopen the case,
saying he made his diagnosis on the basis of faulty information,
including police claims that Whitehouse had been exercising only
moderately.
   Metcalfe was in the class of 50 cadets who apparently underwent
strenuous exercise with little water the first day of class, Sept.
19, at a police academy in Agawam, which provides uniform training
for police departments in the 74 towns and cities of western
Massachusetts.
   Metcalfe was hospitalized for at least two days that week with
kidney problems that required dialysis treatment, authorities said.
Fifteen other cadets were also hospitalized for ailments from heat
stroke to exhaustion and dehydration.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield, the only other cadet still
hospitalized Tuesday, remained in critical condition at the
Pittsburgh hospital where he underwent a liver transplant two weeks
ago.
   Metcalfe's boss, Ludlow Police Chief John Jorge, said he
believed the cadet suffered a relapse after his doctor allowed him
back to the academy last week.
   The nursing supervisor said he didn't know if Metcalfe's
rehospitalization was related to his police training, but said the
cadet had been healthy before beginning training.
   The state Department of Public Safety has suspended such
discipline techniques as pushups and laps at the state's six police
academies, but it was unclear if physical training had resumed.
Department spokesmen were at meetings Tuesday and did not
immediately return telephone calls.
   At least four state investigations are under way into the cause
of the hospitalizations and the regimen at the state-run academy.
   At least a dozen state representatives headed for a meeting
Tuesday on their investigation of academy practices. The committee
has said it will submit recommendations to the full state House by
Dec. 31.

   U.S. authorities may offer Ferdinand Marcos a
promise he will not go to prison if he pleads guilty and forfeits
money he allegedly stole from the Philippine Treasury when he was
that country's president, government sources said Tuesday.
   The possibility of making the offer to Marcos, who has not been
indicted, was discussed last week at a meeting between the State
Department's chief legal counsel, Abraham Sofaer, and an aide to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The sources supplied the information following a story in the
Los Angeles Times, which had obtained a State Department cable
relayed from Sofaer to other department officials following last
week's meeting between Sofaer and Thornburgh aide Robin Ross.
   The discussions between the state and justice departments
revolve around a criminal investigation of Marcos by U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani in Manhattan.
   The White House said the National Security Council staff has
informally reviewed information from the Justice Department
outlining a proposed fraud case against Marcos.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that the
matter ``hasn't come to the president yet.''
   ``The Justice Department is considering whether to bring it
before a grand jury,'' Fitzwater said. ``They have given us
information on the case.''
   Fitzwater said the matter would be presented to Reagan for a
decision after a formal recommendation has been received from
Thornburgh. Recommendations also will be sought from Secretary of
State George Shultz and others in the Cabinet, he said.
   Asked if a decision from Reagan can be expected before the Nov.
8 presidential election, Fitzwater said, ``I have no idea. The
Justice Department has given us a preliminary indication of the
basis of the case.''
   According to the cable obtained by the Times, the State
Department wants to give Marcos ``a last chance, prior to
indictment,'' to reach a settlement. Federal prosecutors prefer to
indict him first to gain added leverage.
   ``(The Department of) Justice has presented no good reason why
we should not continue to insist on offering Mr. Marcos a chance to
reach a voluntary plea agreement prior to indictment,'' the cable
said.
   The cable also said federal officials fear that Marcos, if
indicted, might ``seek to involve and embarrass'' U.S. and
Philippine officials by making allegations of improper or illegal
conduct by them.
   The Times quoted unidentified sources familiar with the
investigation as saying U.S. officials are worried that Marcos may
threaten to reveal politically damaging information about his
dealings with U.S. officials to pressure the White House to block
prosecution.
   The State Department also had argued that any indictment of
Marcos should be limited to alleged criminal acts committed after
he fled to Hawaii.
   Prosecutors in Giuliani's office have countered that the only
way to recover any of the allegedly ill-gotten fortune in Manhattan
real estate and fine art that Marcos allegedly has acquired is to
charge him with acts of fraud that began while he was still
president of the Philippines.
   State Department officials, according to the cable, finally
accepted the prosecutors' argument on condition that the indictment
be drawn _ and that Thornburgh's public statements be constructed _
to emphasize illegal conduct after Marcos came to the United States.
   The cable said its is important to offer Marcos a plea bargain,
even if he declines to accept it.
   ``Prosecution of Mr. Marcos ... could set a precedent that would
have a negative impact on our ability to influence other heads of
state who may be similarly situated to leave power,'' the cable
said.

   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
did not fully investigate up to 82 percent of job discrimination
claims over a three-month period last year, the General Accounting
Office reported Tuesday.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who ordered the GAO study as
chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said ``I find
it outrageous that there are people across the country who may have
a legitimate job discrimination claim denied because the EEOC
mishandled the case, didn't enforce the law or was more concerned
with reducing paperwork than with protecting claimants' civil
rights.''
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the stated
policy of the EEOC since 1983 has been to ``fully investigate''
charges of violations of federal, state and local anti-employment
discrimination laws. However, the task has proved difficult because
more than 100,000 employment discrimination charges are filed
annually, the agency said.
   GAO reviewed investigations of cases closed between January
through March 1987 in which no evidence of discrimination was
found. The GAO said 41 to 82 percent of the charges closed by the
six EEOC district offices and 40 to 87 percent of charges closed by
five state agencies were not fully investigated.
   The state agencies reviewed were in Georgia, Michigan, New York,
Northern California and Tennessee.
   The report said EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas and four of the
five state agencies reviewed generally disagreed with the GAO's
findings. Among the criticisms included the criteria GAO used in
reviewing the investigations, how GAO applied the criteria and how
GAO selected the samples to review.
   However, Hawkins said the results showed another giant step
backward in the fight against job discrimination.
   ``The EEOC's failure to fully investigate job discrimination
claims is further evidence of the agency's attack on civil rights
protections,'' said Hawkins. ``The agency is showing a total
disregard for the law and for the individuals they must serve.
   ``These investigative breakdowns give a tragic human perspective
to the Reagan-Bush administration civil rights failures,'' he said.
``From the first day in office, their policy was to undermine and
eliminate civil rights protections for women and minorities. Today,
this GAO report shows just how damaging this policy has been.''

   President Reagan made a telephone call Tuesday
to a school in Hendersonville, Tenn., to thank pupils who sent him
a quilt depicting the state birds in the 50 states, a White House
spokesman said.
   Mark Weinberg said Reagan initially talked to Donna Lilla, a
teacher who supervised the project by young fifth-grade children in
connection with their study of American history and the
Constitution.
   Weinberg said that a portion of the president's conversation was
piped into the Wessington Place Elementary School, and that Reagan
complimented the youths on the ``wonderful, beautiful'' quilt.
   He said the president told the pupils that he ``admired their
artisty and handiwork'' and told them he would have the quilt
displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet and his aides
are like ``sullen children'' in their reluctance to accept defeat
in last week's plebiscite, the main political opposition leader
said Tuesday.
   In another development, the air force commander disagreed with
Gen. Pinochet's claims of a hidden victory in his loss of the
yes-or-no plebiscite in which he sought to extended his presidency
until 1997.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democrats
and official spokesman of a 16-party opposition alliance, said he
was not surprised by Pinochet's initial rejection of calls to
negotiate with the coalition.
   ``We understand how the first reaction of those who are
accustomed to imposing their will at any cost is one of sullen
children, as ... Pinochet and the governing team that surrounds
him,'' he told a news conference.
   Aylwin, 69, is widely considered the most likely alliance
candidate in an open election planned for December 1989. Asked by
reporters about speculation that Pinochet might run, he said:
   ``I believe that for us democrats the best adversary we could
face ... is precisely Pinochet. We already beat him once, and
undoubtedly ... we would beat him again.''
   In the referendum last Wednesday, more than 3.8 million people,
or 54 percent, voted against Pinochet's bid for another eight-year
term.
   Pinochet seized power in September 1973, ousting the elected
government of President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist who
died in the coup. The terms of his 1980 constitution call for the
general, who still is army commander, to turn over power in March
1990 to the winner of next year's election.
   The opposition wants the government to negotiate several changes
in the constitution, particularly to hasten the election and
Pinochet's departure, but Pinochet has said no changes in the
timetable will be permitted.
   Pinochet and some Cabinet members claim the referendum showed
him to be the most popular political figure in the country since
the ``no'' votes came from several opposition groups.
   ``It's natural for everyone to try to draw water to his own
mill,'' air force commander Fernando Matthei said Tuesday, using a
Chilean expression for pursuing personal interest, ``but the only
reality is that Chileans as a majority said `no.' ''
   Gen. Matthei is considered a moderate in the military junta,
whose four members act as a legislature. The other members are army
Gen. Humberto Gordon, designated by Pinochet; Adm. Jose Merino, the
navy commander, and Gen. Rodolfo Stange, director of the national
police.

   Parliament on Tuesday postponed a vote on whose
outcome Premier Ciriaco De Mita has staked the future of his
6-month-old government.
   The vote is on a measure to eliminate most secret voting in the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. Voting was set for late
Tuesday, but was put off to Wednesday at the earliest after the
rules committee failed to agree on the exact text.
   De Mita indicated last Saturday that he will resign if the
reform fails to pass. The premier was scheduled to leave on
Thursday for Moscow.
   The five parties in his coalition _ De Mita's Christian
Democrats, the Socialists, Republicans, Liberals and Social
Democrats _ pledged to abolish most secret voting when they formed
the government in April.
   The reform is aimed at reining in ``snipers,'' lawmakers from
government parties who vote in secret against party line. The
practice has weakened many of Italy's governments. De Mita's is the
48th government since World War II.
   The vote on the measure will itself be secret and thus snipers
could be critical.
   The Senate will consider its own version of the reform
separately.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Tuesday announced a
final settlement providing $750,000 to nine people who were
subjected to mind-control experiments by their psychiatrist, whose
research was aided by a CIA front organization.
   The CIA in the late 1950s granted $60,000 to Dr. Ewen Cameron, a
Canadian and former president of the World Psychiatric Association
as well as the Canadian and American psychiatric associations, who
used the money to conduct a series of experiments with his patients.
   He subjected the patients to drug-induced sleep therapy for
weeks at a time, gave them LSD and administered electroshock
therapy at up to 75 times the usual intensity.
   Cameron's goal, to reprogram behavior, caught the attention of
CIA officials at a time when the agency was concerned with
countering purported Soviet and Chinese breakthroughs in
brainwashing and interrogation techniques.
   The CIA initiated a chemical-biological warfare research project
known as MKULTRA, to aid in eforts.
   The nine former patients of Cameron brought a suit in 1980 in
U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., and a tentative settlement
with the CIA, now given final approval, was disclosed last week in
court.

   A former weapons analyst for the Army pleaded
guilty Tuesday to espionage for passing classified information to
the South African government, the first such prosecution involving
that country.
   Thomas Joseph Dolce, 49, once a civilian employee at the
Aberdeen Proving Ground, north of Baltimore, admitted mailing a
classified document in 1979 to Col. Bernardus Redelinghuys, a
defense and armed forces attache at the South African Embassy in
Washington.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary P. Jordan did not describe the
information, saying only that Dolce provided it because of its
potential use for sabotage and because Dolce felt the United States
should be sharing the information with South Africa, a staunchly
anti-communist country that is ruled by its white minority under a
system of racial segregation known as apartheid.
   Authorities said Dolce, who is now cooperating with the
investigation, insisted his activities were motivated by
ideological, rather than financial, concerns. Jordan said there is
no evidence that Dolce accepted money from the South Africans.
   Defense attorney Harold I. Glaser said Dolce was the only U.S.
citizen involved, adding the government learned of his client's
activities ``inadvertently.'' Glaser declined to elaborate.
   The attorney said Dolce acted out of a ``misguided sense of
patriotism. He did it out of what he considered to be loyalty, but
it was of course a gigantic, gigantic mistake.''
   Dolce was employed by the Army Material Systems Analysis
Activity, a Department of the Army agency charged with evaluating
weapons systems. He held a security clearance of secret, and the
documents involved were classified secret.
   Dolce told investigators that he had a longtime interest in
South Africa, and in 1971 sold his residence in this country and
emigrated there, according to Jordan. However, he became frustrated
by the job opportunities there and South Africa's one-year
residency requirement before he could obtain a defense-related
position.
   Dolce returned to the United States, and in 1973 he was hired by
the Department of the Army.
   Authorities would not discuss the extent of the damage Dolce's
activities caused national security.
   ``The extent of Mr. Dolce's relationship with South African
officials will be the subject of debriefings by the FBI,'' U.S
Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox said in a statement. ``Only after
those debriefings will we be in a position to assess the full
extent of his dealings.''
   ``In the first instance we consider this whole thing history,''
said Alayne Resberg, press secretary for the South African Embassy.
``Two of the officers allegedly involved have already retired from
active service, and the third officer is no longer in the United
States of America.
   ``We would just like to point out that South Africa doesn't
consider itself an unfriendly nation toward the U.S.A.,'' she said,
adding that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has talked
to anyone in the embassy about the case.
   Although Dolce pleaded guilty to only one count, authorities
said Dolce passed over numerous documents until he terminated his
relationship with the South Africans in 1983, apparently because of
a personality clash with the embassy's new defense attache.
   Dolce agreed to plead guilty as part of an arrangement with
federal prosecutors. In exchange for his cooperation with
government investigations, he was not prosecuted under a more
severe statute carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Authorities said they would recommend Dolce be sentenced to 10
years in prison and a $10,000 fine, the maximum for his conviction.
   U.S. District Judge Herbert F. Murray ordered that Dolce be held
in jail without bail pending a sentencing date, which has yet to be
set.

   Three evangelists who traveled the Southern
revival circuit pleaded guilty Tuesday to running an interstate sex
ring of boys they recruited with gifts and money and then molested.
   Mario ``Tony'' Leyva, Rias Edward Morris and Freddie M. Herring
entered guilty pleas to federal charges they used the Tony Leyva
Evangelistic Association Inc., based in Columbus, Ga., to recruit
boys for homosexual prostitution.
   Dozens of boys told investigators they were given money, lodging
and gifts in return for letting the preachers molest them. The
evangelists were not accused of selling the boys' services to
others.
   Leyva took the witness stand and said he had molested at least
100 boys, beginning in the 1960s in North Carolina, where he began
having sex with the young brothers of his wife, from whom he has
since been divorced.
   FBI Special Agent John Terry said an investigation had uncovered
dozens of the preachers' victims in the South and Midwest.
   ``Four of the boys stated they were victims of all three,''
Terry said. ``Six of the boys were victims of at least two. The
victims ranged from an 8-year-old on up to the mid-teens.''
   Leyva pleaded guilty to conspiracy and four counts of shipping
minors across state lines for prostitution. The charges carry a
penalty of 45 years in prison, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennie
Montgomery agreed to seek a maximum of 20 years in a child
molesters' prison unit in Butner, N.C.
   The preachers will undergo psychiatric evaluations at the
pedophile unit beginning Oct. 25.
   Morris, Leyva's ministry organist, pleaded guilty to conspiracy
and three counts of aiding and abetting the interstate transport of
a minor for prostition. The charges carry a penalty of 35 years in
prison, but the prosecutor agreed to ask for no more than 15 years.
   Herring, founder of the Lighthouse Assembly in Douglasville,
Ga., pleaded guilty to one count of interstate transportation of a
minor for homosexual prostitution and one count of aiding and
abetting interstate transportation of a minor for prostitution. The
counts carry 20 years in prison, but the plea bargain calls for a
maximum sentence of 15 years.
   ``I'm sorry that this happened, and I hope that their hurt will
not linger,'' Herring testified. ``I'm asking for their
forgiveness.''
   Ms. Montgomery said the plea agreements were a good deal for the
government as well as for the victims who did not have to relive
their molestation by testifying.
   The indictment alleged that the Pentecostal preachers abused
boys in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Ohio and Indiana. Police received complaints
about Leyva over the years, but usually by the time they got them,
he had crossed state lines en route to the next revival, making it
hard for a case to be built, Ms. Montgomery said.
   Up to seven more preachers were identified as child molesters
when the FBI questioned Leyva, Morris and Herring, she said. The
offenses sounded like local crimes and she said she would turn over
information to authorities in Indiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   Last month, Leyva was convicted by a Roanoke County Circuit
Court jury of two counts of oral sodomy on teen-age boys and
recommended that he receive counseling during a two-and-a-half-year
prison term.

   The Communist Party leadership
made changes at the top of the party and government Tuesday in a
meeting that also expressed clear opposition to sweeping economic
or political reform.
   Ladislav Adamec, 62-year-old premier of the Czech lands, was
chosen as new federal premier to replace Lubomir Strougal, who
resigned Monday after more than 18 years in the job and gave up his
seat on the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   Jaromir Johanes becomes foreign minister, replacing Bohuslav
Chnoupek. He has been first deputy foreign minister since July 1987
and is a former ambasssador to Canada and the United States.
   Interior Minister Vratislav Vajnar, 58, will be replaced by
Frantisek Kincl.
   The changes were made at a two-day meeting of the party Central
Committee session, which ended Tuesday, and were announced at a
news conference by Jan Fojtik, the new party ideologist. He also
said five men were made full members of the Politburo, increasing
the membership from 12 to 15.
   Peter Colotka, who resigned as premier of Slovakia on Monday,
also stepped down from the Politburo.
   Czechoslovakia's leaders appear to have been discouraged by
developments in neighboring Hungary and Poland. Efforts toward
reform there, or public demand for it, have created serious
problems for the communist governments.
   This country has no shortage of basic consumer goods and the
foreign debt and inflation are comparatively low.
   Vasil Bilak, a hardline member, remained on the Politburo but
now is in charge of foreign policy because Fojtik has been given
Bilak's old job as party ideologist.
   Bilak and party chief Milos Jakes are among only a few senior
officials left from the leadership installed after a Soviet-led
invasion crushed Alexander Dubcek's brief ``Prague Spring''
liberalization in 1968.
   Fojtik said Rudolf Rohlicek, first deputy premier, will be in
charge of the government until the changes can be approved by the
parliament next month.
   Ladislav Gerle, in charge of the recently created ``super
ministry'' including metallurgy, engineering and electrotechnical
industry, is being replaced by Karel Julis, 59, a former Czech
minister of education, youth and physical training.
   Savotpluk Potac, head of the State Planning Commission, gave way
to Bohumil Urban.
   New Politburo members are Miroslav Zavadil, 56; Miroslav Stepan,
43; Karel Urbanek, 47; Frantisek Pitra, 56, and Ivan Knotek, 52.
   Fojtik said Colotka would become ambassador to France and Knotek
would replace him as premier of Slovakia.
   Strougal, 63, was considered the chief advocate of economic
reforms, but observers said party conservatives diluted his plans.
   In a long speech to the Central Committee on Monday, Fojtik made
clear that the leadership opposes radical political and economic
changes similar to those Mikhail S. Gorbachev is promoting in the
Soviet Union.
   According to the text distributed Tuesday by the official news
agency CTK, he expressed support for cautious reform and emphasized
the party's leading role.
   ``One of the most fundamental lessons of the past is that in
looking for and pursuing new ways of development, we must under no
circumstances permit the weakening of the leading role of the
Communist Party,'' Fojtik said.
   He warned of ``private-ownership petit-bourgeois ideology'' and
rejected foreign criticism of Czechosovakia's tough approach to
dissident movements.
   ``We must not close our eyes to any of the risks of reform,''
the party ideologist said. ``Superficial journalism, and here we
are not speaking only about our own authors, makes light of some
(of these problems) or passes them over in silence altogether while
dramatizing others.''

   Snow fell in Michigan and sleet was reported in Indiana Tuesday,
while other parts of the nation got scattered showers.
   Upper Michigan and the eastern part of the state received some
snowfall in the afternoon, but it was too light to measure. Frost
and freeze warnings were posted for Tuesday night across Indiana
except for the northeast corner. Fort Wayne and South Bend, Ind.,
got some sleet during the day.
   Rain was widely scattered over the rest of lower Michigan and
northern Indiana, as well as western New York state, northwest
Pennsylvania and northern Ohio. Thunderstorms also were scattered
over the southern coast of Maine and over northeast California into
northwest Nevada.
   An inch of snow fell at Mount Washington, N.H., during the six
hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   The nation's low for the morning was 12 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 92 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Wednesday's forecast called for rainshowers reaching west from
the lower Great Lakes across the northern half of the Appalachians,
changing to snow in the higher elevations. Skies should be cloudy
along the northern Pacific Coast, with gusty winds over the
northern Rockies.
   High temperatures should be in the 30s and 40s from the Great
Lakes across the northern half of the Appalachians and northern New
England. Highs in 50s and 60s should be the rule from central New
England across the Carolinas, from the Ohio Valley across the
Tennessee Valley and inland portions of the central Gulf of Mexico
states, the upper Mississippi Valley, eastern Kansas and Nebraska,
the Dakotas, the Pacific Northwest and the northern California
coast. Highs should rise into the 80s over much of the Florida
peninsula, southern Texas and inland California, reaching into the
90s to near 100 through the desert Southwest.

   The Rev. Ian Paisley, a militant
Protestant member from Northern Ireland, shouted ``I renounce you
as the anti-Christ!'' as Pope John Paul II spoke of unity Tuesday
to the European Parliament.
   Paisley's outburst came as the pontiff began delivering the key
speech of his trip to northeastern France, in which he urged Europe
to adopt a common political structure. The European Parliament is
an advisory body to the 12-member European Economic Community.
   The pope returned to Rome Tuesday evening, ending the four-day
visit. He met briefly with Premier Michel Rocard before boarding
his special airliner in a heavy rain.
   Paisley stood by his desk in the back of the assembly chamber
during welcoming remarks by Lord Plumb, president of the
Parliament. As the pope began speaking, he was immediately
interrupted by Paisley, standing about 11 rows from the pontiff.
   ``I renounce you! I renounce you as the anti-Christ,'' shouted
Paisley, leader of the Irish Protestant Democratic Unionist Party,
who was instantly surrounded by about a dozen deputies to the
Parliament. They shouted to drown out his insults, threw paper at
him and tore from his hands a crude orange banner reading: ``Pope
John Paul II, anti-Christ.''
   Plumb twice called for order and then evicted Paisley to the
applause of deputies and an estimated 300 spectators in the gallery.
   A group of deputies dragged and shoved Paisley from the hall. He
later told journalists, ``I was hammered. I was beaten about the
ears and body.''
   John Paul smiled briefly at the outburst and resumed his speech
that was again interrupted, this time by a round of applause.
   Paisley has spearheaded opposition to the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement which granted the government of Catholic-dominated
Ireland a say in the running of Northern Ireland, a British
province where 60 percent of the population is Protestant.
   The pope has not taken a stand on whether the province should be
united with the Irish Republic but has called for peace and
reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants.
   As he has throughout his trip, John Paul urged the unification
of Europe and encouraged the nations to serve as ``a beacon in the
civilization of the world'' by fighting pollution, prejudice and
secularization.
   John Paul said the agreement by the 12 European Community
members to integrate their economies by 1992 would hasten political
integration. Some Common Market officials have called for
development of a common political organization _ perhaps even a
``United States of Europe.''
   ``A common political structure ... far from endangering the
identity of the people of the community, will be better suited to
guarantee more fairly the rights ... of all regions,'' said the
68-year-old pontiff.
   The comment challenged a statement last month by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said creating a pan-European
political structure was ``utopian'' and would detract from the
diversity of European cultures.
   In addition to Britain and France, the EEC members include
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and West Germany.
   Paisley was first elected to the European Parliament from
Northern Ireland in 1979. He was elected by a similar, but larger,
mainly Protestant constituency that has elected him to Britain's
House of Commons since 1970.
   The Polish-born pope encouraged the Parliament to unite with
central and eastern Europe and build on a shared Christian heritage.
   Speaking in both English and French, he said a united Europe
would benefit the individual countries economically and that some
of the wealth should be used to help the Third World ``without any
thought of domination, with the intention of helping poor countries
to take in hand their own destiny.''
   Europe should remember its common Christian roots and look to
the church to guide society, he said.
   The pope began his day by paying homage to the patron saint of
Alsace-Lorrain at the mountaintop monastery of Mont Saint Odile.
After the address at Parliament, he said Mass at a packed stadium
in the industrial city of Mulhouse, near the Swiss border.
   On Saturday, John Paul began his visit by launching an appeal
for a unified Europe at the Council of Europe and the European
Court and Commission of Human Rights.

   Hundreds of demonstrators, demanding
easier access to experimental drugs for people with AIDS, blocked
entrances to the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters
Tuesday, prompting police to close the building to arriving
employees.
   Vito Russo, a New York writer who said he was diagnosed with
AIDS in 1985, said the demonstrators did not want the FDA to stop
testing drugs, but to move faster and make AIDS drugs available as
soon as it is determined they are safe _ rather than waiting to
judge their effectiveness as well.
   ``The side effect of AIDS is death,'' Russo said.
   Montgomery County police, some of them wearing clear plastic
surgical gloves, arrested and charged 175 demonstrators with
loitering for blocking entrances. One protester was arrested and
charged with assault and battery of an officer during the slow,
methodical process which went on for more than six hours.
   Most of the arrested protesters elected to walk to the waiting
police buses, where they were handcuffed with plastic ties. A few
chose to be dragged and were accommodated by pairs of officers.
Police said all those arrested were later released and would be
scheduled to appear in court at a later date.
   Four men climbed atop two of the buses and huddled under
blankets whipped by a chilly wind. Police made no attempt to remove
them until they got ready to move the buses. When the men refused
to get off the rooftops, they were handcuffed and dropped through
hinged skylights into the compartments below _ to cheers and
laughter from their watching compatriots.
   At least two glass door panels were broken during jostling
between surging crowds and police during the early minutes of the
demonstration.
   Police allowed demonstrators wearing armbands designating them
as medical personnel to go onto the buses to check on those already
handcuffed and arrested, some of whom wore lettered shirts saying
they had AIDS.
   A woman police officer carrying two cups of coffee walked past
some of the protesters and was jokingly offered $5 for one of
coffees. ``How's this?'' she said, giving away one of the cups
without breaking stride.
   Before returning to her assignment of helping usher arrestees
onto a bus, the officer slipped on a pair of plastic gloves and
then hid them from view with a pair of white mittens.
   There was no accurate count of how many of the estimated 4,500
people who normally work in the sprawling, 17-story building had
arrived at work early and were inside when police started turning
people back at 7:30 a.m. EDT. About 2,000 FDA employees work in the
building, and agency spokesman Brad Stone said he thought about
1,500 made it in. They were urged to report early, before the
demonstration began.

   A nuclear weapons test is scheduled Thursday at
the Nevada Test Site, the 11th announced test at the desert site
this year.
   The nuclear device will be buried 2,100 feet beneath the surface
of Yucca Flat, 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The test is code-named Dalhart, and the blast is expected to
cause some ground motion in Las Vegas.
   Managers of high-rise buildings in the city were alerted Tuesday
not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the
blast, which is scheduled for 7 a.m.
   The last previous test was Bullfrog, conducted Aug. 30.
   Dalhart is the 686th announced test at the Nevada Test Site
since testing began at the desert site in January of 1951.

   Two men won seats in Armenia's legislature with
support from leaders of strikes that paralyzed the southern
republic for weeks, but Armenian authorities voided their
elections, an activist said Tuesday.
   Their victories were among the first in which unofficial
candidates defeated Communist Party nominees.
   A high-ranking Communist who had certified the two men's
elections was kicked out of the party and faces dismissal from his
government job, the official news agency Tass reported.
   It said the bureaucrat falsified the election returns by
certifying H. Stamboltsyan as a winner.
   Stamboltsyan and candidate Ashot Manucharian were backed by the
Karabakh Committee, activist Galstyan Ambartsum said. The committee
wants the Nagorno-Karabakh region of neighboring Azerbaijan, whose
population is predominantly Armenian, to be made part of Armenia.
   The Karabakh Committee organized strikes. The ethnic dispute led
to arson and gunfights, and the central government sent soldiers
with tanks to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh last month.
   Soviet officials say the situation in both areas has stabilized
and workers have been returning to their jobs.
   Ambartsum, a member of the Karabakh Committee, said by telephone
from Yerevan, capital of Armenia, that the group put up two
candidates in an interim election for three seats in the Supreme
Soviet of Armenia.
   He said Stamboltsyan beat the interior minister, the republic's
top police official, by a 4-1 margin and Manucharian got 70 percent
of the vote against the foreign minister. Neither he nor Tass said
when the election was held.
   On Monday, the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist Party
threw out Stamboltsyan's victory on grounds he was not a registered
candidate, Ambartsum said. Tass said Stamboltsyan ``had not been
registered and did not receive a majority of the votes of all the
voters of the district.''
   Tass did not mention Manucharian. Ambartsum said the leadership
canceled Manucharian's victory by saying that he had to win with 75
percent of the vote, which the activist declared to be a lie.
   Several non-party members backed by unofficial citizen groups
have won local offices this year in the Baltic republics of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   According to Tass, the Armenian Central Committee expelled K.L.
Mandalyan, from the party and recommended he lose his job in the
bureaucracy for certifying Stamboltsyan's victory.
   It said Mandalyan presided over a meeting of the local election
commission and pushed through acceptance of the victory while only
six of the 14 members were present. The agency said he delivered
the documentation to the Karabakh Committee, which announced the
victory in Yerevan's central square.
   Mandalyan's action was a ``deliberate political provocation''
that fired ethnic and nationalist passions, the local party
committee said. Tass reported that V. Galumyan, the republic's vice
president, was reprimanded for failing to prevent Mandalyan's
action.

<HEAD>Parties Say Namibia Talks Produced No Agreement On Cuban
Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomats were deadlocked over the weekend in
trying to set a timetable for pulling out 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola, Cuban and Angolan envoys involved in the negotiations said
Tuesday.
   South Africa has scheduled for Nov. 1 the start of an
independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, known as
Namibia, but it has linked it to Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola.
   The Pretoria government says the Cubans threaten the
independence of Namibia, which borders Angola.
   Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, and
Angola's ambassador to the U.N., Manuel Pedro Pacavira, said the
U.S., Cuban, Angolan and South African negotiators reached no
agreement in talks held Friday through Sunday.
   They spoke at a news conference in response to published reports
saying the talks reached agreement on a 24-to-30 month pullout by
the Cubans.
   ``We are at an impasse, which is not precisely synonymous with
`agreement,''' said Alarcon.
   ``As you can see in the newspapers' reports almost daily, we
haven't yet achieved an agreement or understanding on the calendar
for the withdrawal of the Cuban forces in Angola,'' he said.
   Pacavira reiterated that assessment during the news conference
held at the National Council of Churches headquarters in Manhattan.
   Alarcon said Cuba and Angola need 30 months to train and equip
Angolan forces to deal with any future raids by South Africa or by
the UNITA rebels that are backed by the United States and South
Africa.
   The United States, serving as mediator in the talks, has
suggested a 24-month withdrawal and South Africa agrees, said
Alarcon and Pacavira.
   Pacavira said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month
ago in a meeting in Brazzaville, Congo.
   South Africa in the past has launched periodic raids from
Namibia into southern Angola to back up UNITA forces when they
encountered heavy resistance from Cuban forces.
   Under a preliminary agreement in the peace talks, all South
African forces left southern Angola by Sept. 1.
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa on Tuesday termed reports
of an agreement inaccurate, saying ``the timetable needs to be
worked out.'' He commented while on a visit to Zurich, Switzerland.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the talks ``were helpful in more precisely defining the gaps
remaining between the parties.''
   ``They recognize that further decisions are required to reach an
agreement acceptable to all sides,'' she said.
   Diplomats involved in the talks say they are working toward
reaching agreement on a Cuban withdrawal timetable at a meeting to
be held this month in Brazzaville.
   However, U.S. officials, Botha and Alarcon have said it may not
be possible to reach the Nov. 1 deadline set by the United Nations
for transition to independence for Namibia.
   When the independence plan begins, the United Nations will send
7,500 peacekeepers and 2,000 civilian support staff to supervise
elections for a national assembly that will adopt a constitution
and form an independent government.
   Under the U.N. plan, independence will be achieved in one year
as the U.N. peacekeepers maintain order and supervise the South
African withdrawal.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush sparred at a distance over trade
issues on Tuesday in a prelude to this week's prime-time debate.
The Democrat vowed to stand up for American companies and jobs
while the vice president charged that his rival was guilty of
``protectionist demagoguery.''
   ``My opponent needs an issue and he's willing to scare people to
find it,'' Bush said of Dukakis' recent emphasis on a need to
regain American dominance in world economic competition.
   Dukakis counterpunched a few hours later as he left Boston for
the West Coast. ``I'm for more trade, not less trade. I want to
export American products, not American jobs,'' he said.
   Dukakis also took a fresh swipe at the Republican vice
presidential candidate as new polls indicated Bush's ticketmate is
draining support from the GOP. Said the Democrat: ``Dan Quayle asks
us to believe that if he ever had to fill in for George Bush,
America could get by on a right wing and a prayer.''
   Bush defended his pick for vice president, saying Quayle had
helped draft legislation that created jobs for the poor.
   The two combatants in the race for the White House exchanged
barbs as fresh polls charted a dwindling lead for Bush with four
campaign weeks remaining. The surveys showed Dukakis and running
mate Lloyd Bentsen gaining ground since last week's vice
presidential debate.
   Despite the polls, surveys by The Associated Press and others in
recent weeks have indicated that Bush holds a marked advantage in
the Electoral College, with the race likely to be decided by the
results in several large swing states.
   The Democratic gains were also tempered when party officials
announced that two senior strategists had been pulled out of
Florida in what seemed to be a concession that Bush's double-digit
lead there would be all but impossible to overcome. The two were
headed for Ohio, a swing state where Dukakis is viewed as trailing
more narrowly.
   Both candidates set aside time over the next few days to prepare
for their second and final debate of the fall campaign, set to
begin at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday on the campus of UCLA. In a race as
close as theirs, a nationally televised debate could be critical in
shaping the outcome.
   Debate sponsors announced late in the day that Cable News
Network anchorman Bernard Shaw would moderate the Bush-Dukakis
encounter. The questions will be asked by Andrea Mitchell of NBC,
Ann Compton of ABC and Margaret Warner of Newsweek.
   In a speech near Boston before flying west, Dukakis mentioned
several steps to improve America's ability to ``take charge of our
future,'' including a major effort to improve the nation's
scientific and engineering capabilities. ``I want us to begin
selling cars and computers and compact discs to the Germans and the
Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to the ayatollah,'' he said.
   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in the
world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and
produce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,''
added Dukakis, who has campaigned recently as a critic of foreign
ownership of American firms.
   The Democratic candidate said the formula for victory in the
global economic battle might include government protection for some
firms struggling against foreign competition.
   Bush campaigned in Seattle, where he said foreign ownership of
U.S. plants helps to create jobs and suggested that Dukakis was
mouthing campaign rhetoric that he doesn't believe.
   ``Frankly, I've been surprised at my opponent's recent turn to
protectionist demagogury,'' the vice president said in prepared
remarks. ``I don't think he really believes it.''
   Bush added that ``like the Know Nothing Party a century before
him,'' Dukakis had `'turned to fear of foreigners. Or maybe with
this latest flip-flop, he's become a believe-nothing candidate.''
   Bush coupled his attack with a pledge to ``throw the book'' at
inside stock traders and other white-collar criminals. ``They may
not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits, but they are a real
danger to society, and they should be hit with the maximum
penalties of the law,'' he said.
   Bush led Dukakis 50-47 percent in the ABC News-Washington Post
poll conducted Wednesday through Sunday. The survey of 600 likely
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage
points, statistically negating the lead.
   A Gallup survey of 1,007 registered voters found Bush ahead of
Dukakis 49 percent to 43 percent. The survey, conducted Friday
through Sunday, also had a four-point margin of error. Bush pulled
farther ahead among respondents who seemed likely to vote _ 52-41
in a group of 748 _ but the Gallup Organization said it used a
fairly loose gauge of voting likelihood and felt the results were
not fully reliable.
   A Los Angeles Times poll released Monday found that Quayle
remained a drag on the GOP ticket. Bush-Quayle led Dukakis-Bentsen
44-41 percent, but Bush alone led his Democratic opponent 48-39 in
the poll. The weekend survey of 893 registered voters had a margin
of error of five percentage points.
   Quayle took a winding campaign bus tour through rural Ohio. He
attacked Dukakis' handling of a Massachusetts furlough program in
which a first-degree murderer failed to return from a weekend pass
and later attacked a couple in Maryland.
   ``Even after the Horton case, the governor strenuously defended
the furlough program,'' Quayle said. He did not act to change it,''
the Indiana senator added, saying changes were made in the law only
after pressure from the state legislature.
   Bentsen campaigned in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where he
sought to minimize a disagreement with Dukakis over the death
penalty. ``Well, I'm one that favors it, but I must say reasonable
people can differ on that one,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nobel Peace laureate Mother Teresa
of Calcutta has telephoned five Carmelite nuns barricaded inside a
monastery to offer support for their cause, a sister of one of the
nuns said.
   The nuns have been locked inside an infirmary since Oct. 4,
saying they feared eviction from the monastery because of their
complaints that the new prioress was instigating too many changes
at the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel.
   The introduction of television, snacks and videotaped movies
were some of the changes to which the nuns objected.
   The nuns received the call from Mother Teresa Monday night
telling them not to feel deserted by the church, said Doreen
Ercolano, the sister of one of the nuns, Sister Maria.
   ``The phone call from Mother Teresa put new wind in their
sails,'' Ms. Ercolano said.
   Mother Teresa assured the nuns she would speak to Pope John Paul
II on their behalf when she meets him in Rome in a few weeks, Ms.
Ercolano said.
   The five nuns denied reports Tuesday that they are disobedient.
   Sister John of the Cross, a spokeswoman for the group, said she
and the other four are awaiting word from the Vatican as to how
they can settle their standoff with Diocesan and Carmelite
officials.
   ``At this moment, I think they are trying a lot of pressure and
a lot of scare tactics, but we will not be intimidated,'' Sister
John said in a telephone interview. ``We are confident in the
higher authorities in Rome.''
   Sister John said the nuns were upset after Paterson Diocese
Bishop Frank Rodimer took the ``highly irregular'' move of putting
Mother Theresa Hewitt in charge of the monastery without consulting
the 13 nuns who live there. She said the nuns are supposed to elect
the next prioress.
   Tim Manning, a spokesman for Mother Hewitt and Rodimer, said
church officials decided to appoint someone to run the monastery
because tensions there were already high. He did not elaborate.
   In her first public comment on the situation Monday, Mother
Hewitt said some of the changes under fire from the nuns were
instituted by some of her predecessors, including allowing
television and magazines in the monastery.
   When the nuns were given official dismissal warnings in June,
they hired the Rev. Milan Mikulich to defend their effort to remain
in the cloistered order, Sister John said. She said Mother Hewitt
accused them of being disobedient.
   Sister John said four of the nuns went to the infirmary last
week because they grew restless waiting for an official response
from Rome and were afraid visiting church officials would
physically evict them from the monastery. A fifth nun later joined
them.

<HEAD>Rebels Capture Fourth Provincial Capital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem insurgents captured a fourth
provincial capital in Afghanistan, a guerrilla spokesman said
Tuesday, and Western diplomats said several others were under siege.
   The diplomats reported rocket attacks on several provincial
capitals and airports, and said the rebels closed a strategic road,
reducing the supply of food to Kabul, the capital.
   The rebel spokesman, Asim Nasser-Zia of the National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan, said Asadabad, capital of northeastern Kunar
province, fell to guerrillas Monday after a month-long campaign. He
said the victory gave insurgents control of the entire province,
which borders Pakistan.
   The reported victory also opens a northern route to Kabul and
gives guerrillas access to Jalalabad. Asadabad is about 12 miles
from Pakistan, where border towns and refugee camps serve as
guerrilla bases, and 100 miles northeast of Kabul.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and the Soviet Union sent military forces to Afghanistan in
December 1979. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed last April,
the Soviets have been withdrawing their estimated 115,000 soldiers.
   The guerrillas were not a party to the agreement between
Pakistan and Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union and United States
signed as guarantors, and vowed to conmtinue fighting.
   They claim to have overrun several Afghan army garrisons and two
provincial capitals in two weeks, bringing the number of capitals
in their hands to four.
   Sharan, capital of Paktika province in the east, was reported
captured early last week, and diplomats confirmed it.
   Guerrillas also claim to control the capitals of Takhar province
in northern Afghanistan and Bamyan in the center of the mountainous
nation.
   Mohammad Ishaq, spokesman for the Khalis faction of the
Hezb-E-Islami guerrilla group, said several strategic garrisons in
Kunar province were captured along with Asadabad.
   Diplomats said 20-25 rockets are fired every day at the airport
in Kandahar, a southern city. They said the airport in Lashkargah,
capital of western Helmand province, has been closed to civilian
trafic. Airports are regular guerrilla targets.
   Busloads of wounded arrived in Kabul after the bombing of
villages near Maidan Shahr, capital of central Wardak province,
diplomats reported. Guerrillas captured Maidan Shahr earlier but
were pushed out by heavy bombing, rebels and diplomats reported.
   Guerrillas said they had closed the Kabul-Jalalabad highway and
diplomats said no traffic moved east from the capital between Oct.
2-6.
   A report by the official Afghan media said 199 rockets hit the
eastern city of Gardez last week, killing five people. Twenty
people were reported killed by rockets Monday in Jalalabad and
Kabul also is a regular target of guerrilla rockets.

<HEAD>Jury Rules Subway Fire Deaths Accidental</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs UPDATING with reax from victims' kin.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coroner's inquest jury ruled Tuesday that all 31
people killed in a fire at London's busiest subway station last
year died accidentally.
   The jury ruled that all but one of the victims died from smoke
inhalation when fire raced up a wooden escalator at the King's
Cross station and a ball of flames exploded in the ticket lobby
Nov. 18.
   One man died later in hospital from complications resulting from
his burns. Eighty others were injured.
   Matthew Scott, representing relatives of some of the victims,
had urged Coroner Dr. Douglas Chambers to instruct the jury it
could also bring in a verdict of unlawful killing.
   ``There is some evidence, albeit partial and incomplete, that
there has been gross negligence,'' Scott said.
   ``I refer in particular to the failure to apply a drop of water
to that fire for the first 15 minutes of its existence. I refer
possibly to the 18 previous fires which were either undiscovered or
not acted upon, on that escalator,'' he said.
   ``These are simply the tips of the iceberg,'' Scott said. ``The
jury, of course, haven't heard the full story.''
   Chambers rejected the submission and told the jury there was
``no place for a verdict of unlawful killing _ it isn't that sort
of court.''
   Such verdicts were best left to a crminal court, with a judge
and lawyers trained in criminal law, he said. The only other
possible ruling beside accidental death was an open verdict, he
said.
   Investigators believe the fire started when a lighted cigarette
fell onto a wooden escalator surrounded by grease-soaked trash.
Smoking has since been banned throughout the subway system.
   The six-day inquest was delayed while police inquiries and other
investigations were completed. An inquest was required by law to
formally rule on the cause of deaths.
   The government's public inquiry into the fire concluded in June
but its findings have not yet been made public.
   After Tuesday's ruling, Sophie Tarassenko, whose rock musician
brother, Ivan, 25, died in the blaze, complained: ``This is a
complete travesty of the truth.
   ``I was pretty angry before, but I am feeling very, very angry
now,'' she said.
   ``We came here to find out how our relatives died and what
happened to them and they were only ever mentioned as a broad list.
The rest of the time was spent patting people on the back and
saying what a good job they did.''
   Mary Groombridge, whose widowed mother, Natalie Falco, died,
said she was also ``very, very angry as we all are.''
   She said: ``I don't think it was an investigation into how they
died at all. There has been an inquiry investigating the
circumstances of the deaths, but this has been just a total farce.''

   U.S. nuclear weapons are made in an industrial
labyrinth spreading over 13 states and occupying 90,000 people in
16 major plants, three laboratories and a test range, spending
about $7.6 billion a year.
   All of the weapons are produced by a civilian agency, the Energy
Department, and always have been. No administration or Congress has
wanted to give the job to the military.
   It wasn't until the 1950s, in fact, that the armed forces were
even allowed to keep weapons on hand. If they had wanted one, they
would have had to get it from the Atomic Energy Commission, one of
the department's predecessors.
   The DOE operations have recently been the focus of studies and
news reports alleging serious breaches of safety or security at
several facilities.
   The most recent major study of weapons production was published
in 1987 by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group best
known for its lawsuits on behalf of environmental causes.
   The study estimated that the Energy Department in 1985-1990
would produce each year slightly more than 1,800 nuclear bombs,
warheads, shells and other weapons in 10 different types, with 12
more designs in research and development.
   Through 1986, the armed services had deployed 71 different
weapons in 116 different systems. Only 29 types were still in the
stockpile, and the total explosive force available had declined
drastically as new weapons incorporating improved accuracy came
into service.
   Two laboratories design the weapons, often competing with each
other, and a third designs the non-nuclear components of a bomb or
warhead.
   The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was established
in the greatest secrecy by the Army's Manhattan Engineer District,
the fabled Manhattan Project, in 1943 to design and build the two
bombs dropped on Japan in August 1945.
   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, Calif.
was established in 1952 for Edward Teller, the principal backer of
what was called then ``the super'' _ the hydrogen bomb.
   Los Alamos, in fact, designed the first hydrogen, or
thermonuclear, weapons and after a few test failures Lawrence
Livermore started putting its designs into the national stockpile
in 1958.
   The Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., designs the
fuses, security features and new delivery systems in cooperation
with the armed services.
   Recently the Energy Department has been making only two of the
six materials that have been used over the years for nuclear and
thermonuclear weapons, tritium and plutonium.
   The other four _ Lithium-6, uranium-235, uranium-238 and
deuterium _ are not in production for weapons, although some
stockpiled weapons still incorporate uranium, and the uranium is
recycled into new weapons.
   Plutonium, made from uranium in nuclear reactors, is used for
modern weapons in preference to uranium, even though it's more
expensive.
   Only one-third as much plutonium is needed to form the
``critical mass'' that sustains the nuclear reaction, according to
Thomas Cochran, principal author of the Natural Resources Defense
Council study. This permits a lighter, smaller bomb.
   Tritium is used to boost the explosive power of nuclear weapons
and in thermonuclear weapons, all of which use a nuclear device as
a trigger.
   At the moment, there is no production of either plutonium or
tritium.
   These materials recently have come from two sites, a reactor at
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and three
reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C. Hanford made
plutonium and Savannah River made both plutonium and tritium.
   The Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald, Ohio, and the
Ashtabula Plant near Ashtabula, Ohio, supply fuel assembliesto
Hanford and Savannah River.
   These reactors start with uranium from a variety of sources,
including research reactors, spent fuel from warships recovered at
the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls;
inventory accumulated over the years and uranium recycled along
with plutonium from weapons being retired. The government hasn't
bought uranium for weapons since 1971.
   Tritium is produced from lithium-6 recovered from retired
warheads at the Mound Plant at Miamisburg, Ohio.
   It is believed the three reactors at Savannah River had been
concentrating on tritium. Energy Secretary John Herrington has told
Congress ``we're awash in plutonium.''
   It takes 24,000 years for half of a given mass of plutonium to
decay, but half of any amount of tritium is gone in 12.3 years. The
tritium in any weapon must be ``refreshed'' from time to time.
   The Rocky Flats, Colo., plant assembles the fissionable
materials inside conventional high explosive that sets off a
nuclear explosion. The Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., casts
uranium apon.
The Kansas City Plant in Missouri makes fuses and other components,
using electronics from Sandia.
   All these various parts are sent to the Pantex plant at
Amarillo, Texas, for final weapons assembly and shipment to the
military.
   This plant also disassembles warheads being taken out of
service, modifies existing weapons and tests components for
reliability and conformity with design.

   Republican George Bush promised on Tuesday to
crack down on white-collar crime, including insider trading in
stocks, saying people guilty of such activities ``may wear fancy
suits'' but are dangerous all the same.
   Bush also took Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis to
task for his recent criticism of foreign ownership of U.S.
businesses. Bush said, ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's
willing to scare people to find it.''
   His remarks, prepared for delivery to the Seattle University
Business School, were released just before he left Washington, D.C.
for the West Coast. Bush is to spend the next few days in light
campaigning and in preparing for Thursday night's debate with
Democrat Dukakis in Los Angeles.
   ``We will throw the book at insider traders and other
white-collar criminals,'' said the Republican presidential nominee.
``They may not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits, but they
are a real danger to society, and they should be hit with the
maximum penalties of the law.''
   Bush's speech to the Catholic college was disrupted by shouting
from a Jesuit priest, who was forcibly removed from the room by
police and taken away in a squad car. He identified himself as
William Bichsel, who operates a program for the homeless in nearby
Tacoma.
   ``Isn't this a great country. You csn run into all kinds of
characters in my line of work,'' Bush said, continuing with his
speech. ``This one ... amazing.''
   Bichsel shouted questions at Bush about the homeless and, as he
was led away, said: ``They stand for the complete destruction of
the people of this country and abroad. The rich grow richer and
poor grow poorer.''
   Another protester, John Whitney, 30, a philosophy teacher at the
college, also shouted questions at Bush, but left the room when
officials asked him to and was not arrested.
   Whitney, who said he was an associate of Bichsel's, complained
that only business students and faculty were invited to the speech,
and that questions were not permitted.
   ``I stood up because he would not answer questions of
students,'' said Whitney, who was wearing a Dukakis button. ``I
thought the school was being used.''
   Bush's harshest words came in his criticism of the Democratic
candidate's recent assault on foreign ownership.
   ``Frankly, I've been surprised at my opponent's recent turn to
protectionist demagoguery,'' Bush said. ``I don't think he really
believes it. He ran against this so-called `economic nationalism'
in the primaries. But now, for political reasons, he sees advantage
in stoking fears about foreign influence.''
   Bush said that ``like the Know Nothing Party a century before
him,'' Dukakis had ``turned to fear of foreigners. ... Or maybe
with this latest flip-flop, he's become a believe-nothing
candidate.''
   Last week, Dukakis in a speech in Missouri voiced concern about
a rise in foreign ownership of businesses and plants in the United
States.
   And he returned to the subject on Tuesday, asking college
students in Medford, Mass., ``Will we sell out more and more of our
land and our factories and our banks, or will we take charge of our
future?''
   Bush, on the other hand, said. ``Foreign investment in the
United States, whether it's in Wellston, Mo., or Marysville, Ohio,
or right here in Seattle, helps create jobs.''
   The vice president, for the second day in a row, appeared to go
out of his way to mention his running mate by name.
   ``Under the leadership of my running mate, Dan Quayle, we've
revamped our job training program so that it actually helps the
economically disadvantaged find jobs in the private sector,'' he
said.
   On Monday, at an airport rally in Trenton, N.J., Bush said, ``I
urge you to work for me and Dan Quayle.''
   Before this week, Bush hardly ever mentioned the Indiana
senator, who recent polls suggest has become a political liablity
to the vice president's campaign.
   In his remarks on white-collar crime, Bush said, ``For every
share of stock that is bought from someone with inside information,
there is an innocent investor who has paid too much for his or her
goods, just as surely as if a product was misrepresented in a
simple fraud.''
   Bush added, without elaboration, ``I am against business
journalists who buy stock in a company just before writing a
favorable story on that same company.''
   He took another swipe at the news media in the remarks prepared
for the audience of business students. ``I don't have to tell you
the image that many Americans, and many in the press, have of
business students,'' Bush said.
   ``Instead of recognizing that you're learning to help make our
economy run better, they've painted a picture of a generation only
concerned about quick and easy money,'' Bush said.
   From Seattle, Bush was going to Los Angeles to prepare for the
debate with Dukakis.

   A federal embezzlement and racketeering trial
opening Wednesday that once centered on the late Jackie Presser
will now focus on a longtime Presser associate who has emerged as
Ohio's most powerful Teamsters official.
   Harold Friedman, 66, was indicted May 16, 1986, on two counts of
labor racketeering, two of embezzlement and two of making false
statements to the U.S. Department of Labor.
   The president of the 5,000-member Teamsters Local 507, founded
in Cleveland in 1967, is also an international vice president of
the union, the new president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters
and the leader of Teamsters Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio. He
also is president of Bakery Workers Local 19 in Cleveland.
   His co-defendant is Anthony Hughes, 52, Local 507 recording
secretary, who is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and
one count of embezzlement.
   Until recently, both Friedman and Hughes were overshadowed by
the defense of Presser, Teamsters president from 1983 until this
year and Local 507's secretary-treasurer. Presser, who was accused
in the indictment of masterminding the $700,000 scheme, died July 9.
   After numerous delays, the trial is set to begin Wednesday with
jury selection in U.S. District Court. On Oct. 3, questionnaires
were handed out to some 125 prospective jurors in an effort to save
lawyers time in the interrogation process needed to come up with a
12-person panel.
   The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.
   Federal prosecutors will try to prove that Friedman and Hughes
had a role in placing three ``ghosts,'' or people who were paid and
did no union work, on the Local 507 payroll.
   The jury trial will culminate a federal probe that first came to
light six years ago, on Oct. 8, 1982, when U.S. marshals and agents
of the Department of Labor inspector general's office seized
records at the Local 507 building.
   Federal prosecutors had considered the indictment in 1985, but
held back after FBI agents revealed Presser's FBI informant
relationship.
   Presser's defense, according to statements of defense attorney
John R. Climaco, would have been that Presser was told to place
certain men on the local's payroll and to keep them there, in order
to protect and enhance his informant role.
   The Justice Department's Strike Force Against Organized Crime
maintains that Presser never had such authorization.
   Unlike Presser, who made numerous public appearances as the
Teamsters leader and vowed to beat the government's case, Friedman
has never publicly commented, in line with his preference to shun
the press.
   Presser and Hughes have been identified in pre-trial documents
filed with U.S. District Judge George W. White as FBI informants,
who would provide their FBI ``handlers'' with information about
organized crime and Teamsters inner-politics. Friedman apparently
had no such FBI link, and court documents leave unclear whether he
knew anything about the others' FBI connection.

<HEAD>Senate Adopts Bill to Impose Sanctions Against Iraq for Alleged
Posion Gas Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday revived attempts to
impose punitive sanctions against Iraq for its alleged use of
poison gas against Kurdish civilians but eliminated sanctions
senators said would harm U.S. farm exporters.
   The 87-0 roll call vote by which the sanctions measure was
adopted was the third time the Senate has voted on the issue since
poison gas attacks by the Iraqi army were reported in late August.
   The Senate's third attempt to deal with the poison gas issue
came on a bill far less sweeping than sanctions legislation
originally adopted early in September. The new Senate bill closely
follows the line of legislation adopted by the House and represents
a compromise with three House committees.
   It would impose two sanctions immediately. They are:
   _ A ban on the export of munitions and certain high technology
items.
   _ A requirement that the United States oppose loans to Iraq by
international financial institutions such as the World Bank.
   The bill requires President Reagan to impose additional
sanctions by the end of the year if Iraq does not stop the use of
chemical weapons and provide verifiable assurances it will not
again use them.
   The president is required to choose from a list of potential
sanctions that include denying export-import credits, restricting
imports from Iraq, expanding restrictions on exports to Iraq and
downgrading of diplomatic relations.
   Contracts entered into prior to the imposition of sanctions
would be protected.
   Responding to the demands of senators representing farmers
producing such crops as rice or wheat, the legislation imposes no
limitation on agricultural exports to Iraq or the provision of
credit or credit guarantees for agricultural purchases.
   ``The concern is that this not lead to an embargo on
agricultural exports to Iraq,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., saying sanctions are fully justified
by ``the horrifying acts of the Iraqi government to systematically
eliminate its own citizens.''
   ``The world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use of
poison gas by Iraq,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., complained that the measure unfairly
penalized U.S. manufacturers.
   ``Unilateral controls on U.S. agriculture do not work and they
don't work on medical equipment, personal computers or machine
tools,'' Heinz said, adding that Iraq would turn to other suppliers
if U.S. exports of those products were cut off.
   ``They're probably laughing at us in Iraq right now,'' Heinz
said, declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to Iraq
of the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemical
weapons as mustard gas and nerve gas.
   ``It shoots American exporters in the foot and does not get to
the root of the problem,'' he said.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen took target practice at a police academy Tuesday,
then turned his rhetorical fire on George Bush, accusing the
Republican of ``playing politics with the tragedies of crime.''
   Bentsen watched a police-dog demonstration and then picked up an
AR-15 rifle _ the civilian version of the military M-16. The avid
sportsman fired three times and left a tight cluster of holes in
the silhouette target's chest.
   Asked if he were a quail hunter, Bentsen cracked jokes about
``Quayle season'' starting around the first week of November,
ending Nov. 8. ``I plan on bagging a Quayle that day at least,'' he
said, referring to his GOP vice presidential rival.
   Speaking afterward to the recruits at the Allentown police
academy, Bentsen said that while Bush talked about fighting crime,
``this administration has voted to either cut or do away with every
federal assistance program for local law enforcement.''
   The Democrats would add drug enforcement officers and U.S.
attorneys to prosecute cases against drug traffickers and ``put
those fellows in the slammer where they belong,'' he said.
   Later, at a rally in a Philadelphia union hall, Bentsen
ridiculed Bush's choice of Dan Quayle to head the drug interdiction
effort in his administration.
   ``George Bush wants us to follow Dan Quayle into battle,'' he
said. ``I'll tell you, I've been in combat, and I'll pass on that
one.
   ``If George Bush is serious about being president, why would he
chose Dan Quayle for being vice president.''
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Dukakis in connection with a case
in which a Massachusetts inmate attacked a Maryland couple after
failing to return from a furlough. That criticism is off target,
Bentsen said.
   ``When we get into the furlough program,'' he said, Bush was
``playing politics with the tragedies of crime.''
   Bentsen was highlighting the issues of drugs and crime _ areas
where the Democrats have suffered from Republican attack _ on a
one-day swing through eastern Pennsylvania and nearby New Jersey.
The Democrats are trying to get off the defensive on those issues.
   While Dukakis has tightened up Massachusetts' furlough program,
which he inherited from the previous governor, the federal
government has had an extensive furlough system of its own and
tragedies have occurred there also, Bentsen told the police
recruits.
   He said of the vice president, ``He has to assume
responsibility. He's been the second man in command of the
government.''
   Earlier, Bentsen told high school students in Blackwood, N.J.,
that a Democratic administration would separate the United States
from Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   ``You know that song, `Breaking Up Is Hard to Do''' he said in
response to a student question, drawing giggles from the crowd.
``Well, it's not going to be hard to do for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen.''
   ``What you've seen in George Bush and Noriega is kind of a
shotgun wedding,'' he said. The Democrats, he said, would initiate
``a very well publicized divorce from Mr. Noriega.''
   ``While this administration has been talking, illegal drugs have
been flooding our country at a record rate,'' he said in his speech
at Highland Regional High School, which he praised for declaring
itself a ``drug-free zone.''
   Asked about applying the death penalty to drug kingpins, Bentsen
said, ``Well, I'm one that favors it, but I must say reasonable
people can differ on that one.'' Dukakis opposes the death penalty.
   One student, noting talk about legalizing some drugs, asked
Bentsen if he saw ``any positive angle'' in that approach.
   ``No. That's my answer,'' he said. ``I just think you shouldn't
be able to go down to the grocery store and pick between the corn
flakes and the oatmeal and find a package of drugs.''

   Discovery commander Frederick
Hauck, saying he wanted to end his career as an astronaut ``on a
high note,'' announced Tuesday that the first post-Challenger
flight was his last.
   ``I have decided not to go back (to space) again,'' Hauck told
reporters at the Johnson Space Center during the crew's first
post-flight press conference. ``This has been my last space
flight.''
   Hauck, 47, a Navy captain who was selected as an astronaut 10
years ago, cited his age and the number of astronauts ``waiting in
the wings'' as some of reasons for deciding not to fly again. There
are 96 active astronauts.
   He said he decided Monday to have his name taken off the flight
list, but it doesn't mean he is leaving NASA.
   Although he has not decided what he will do next, he said
possibilities include a different job at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration or returning to the Navy.
   The other Discovery astronauts _ pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists John M. Lounge, David C. Hilmers and George D.
``Pinky'' Nelson _ said they plan to remain in the astronaut corps.
   Hauck had flown on two previous shuttles before the historic
Discovery flight, including a Challenger mission that marked the
first flight in space for an American woman _ Sally Ride.

   Most of the O-rings on both booster
rockets from the space shuttle Discovery have been examined and
appear to be in excellent condition, a Morton Thiokol Inc. official
said Tuesday.
   A faulty O-ring was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of
the shuttle Challenger and the deaths of all seven astronauts
aboard.
   Engineers worked around the clock at Cape Canaveral to take
apart the solid rocket motors that helped launch the Discovery
Sept. 29, said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``They disassembled the joints and then they did a visual
inspection of the O-rings,'' Raab said. ``They looked for soot,
charring, and there was none.''
   The seals might have been marred if gas from solid propellant
burning inside the motors reached them, but there was no evidence
that hot gases reached any of the 24 O-rings that had been
inspected as of Tuesday, Raab said.
   After separating from the shuttle two minutes into flight, the
boosters fell by parachute into the Atlantic Ocean and were towed
to shore the next day.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
is calling on House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, to unsnarl the
legislative knot that has blocked passage of a bill granting banks
new securities powers.
   A bill relaxing most of the Depression-era separation between
commercial and investment banking passed the Senate in March.
Competing, although more restrictive, versions have cleared the
Energy and Commerce, and Banking committees in the House.
   However, a jurisdictional battle between Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the Banking Committee, and Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
has dimmed hopes of passing a banking bill before Congress adjourns
for the fall election campaign.
   According to a congressional aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity, staff members from the Banking and Energy and Commerce
committees met Tuesday, but ``fundamental differences remain.''
   Wright has taken the position that St Germain and Dingell must
resolve their dispute themselves.
   But, Greenspan told Wright in a letter dated Friday, ``I am
certain that those differences could be quickly resolved with the
assistance of your leadership.'' A copy of the letter was obtained
Tuesday.
   Greenspan said the legislation was of ``vital importance'' for
the ``long-term strength, stability and viability'' of the banking
system and of ``great importance to the public because it will
result in reduced cost and improved financial services.''
   In the Senate, Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., said Tuesday he plans to move forward with his plan to
attach the Senate banking-securities bill to an unrelated banking
bill that has already passed the House. The idea is to give the
House a way to act without sorting out its jurisdictional snarl.
   However, Proxmire has been unable to get unanimous consent from
all of the Senate's 99 other members for the move. He could proceed
without such an agreement, but only at the risk of prolonged debate
at a time when Congress is trying to adjourn.

   Leftist guerrillas hijacked six
busloads of people in Medellin Tuesday and harrangued their
approximately 300 captives to support a general strike called by a
union for later this month, police said.
   About 100 guerrillas of the National Liberation Army took part,
the national police in Medellin, a city of 2.5 million people in
northwest Colombia, said in a communique.
   Drivers and passengers said in broadcast reports that the
guerrillas forced the buses to Medellin's outskirts Tuesday morning
and made everyone get out and assemble to form an audience.
   ``They made us listen to a speech in favor of the general strike
and against the government's peace proposal,'' bus driver Oswaldo
Correa said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain
RCN.
   The entire episode took about two hours. The guerrillas took the
bus keys with them when they left to immobilize the vehicles until
police arrived.
   Colombia's largest labor union, the Workers' Unitary Central,
has called a general strike for Oct. 27. It asked guerrillas not to
interfere to avoid the strike's leading to violence.
   The last big general strike in Colombia was in 1977. Police and
soldiers fired on rioters in the capital of Bogota, killing 29
people.
   The Workers' Unitary Central is protesting inflation and is
demanding higher wages, a price freeze and an end to right-wing
death squads that have killed about 180 union members in the last
two years.
   The inflation rate has been running at about 22 percent. The
minimum wage is about $90 a month for a six-day work week.
   All six of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups last month turned
down a peace plan proposed by President Virgilio Barco. He called
for a cease-fire with the nation's estimated 10,000 guerrillas;
negotiations, and pardons for all guerrillas who surrendered.

<HEAD>Activist Priest Said Ready To Leave Haiti For Canada</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An activist Roman Catholic priest,
whose church was burned and parishioners killed in a massacre that
sparked the latest coup, will obey orders from his superiors and
leave Haiti, his friends said Tuesday.
   Thugs with guns, machetes, clubs and spikes invaded the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's church, St. Jean Bosco, during Mass on
Sept. 11, killed 13 people and wounded more than 70. They burned
the church down.
   Aristide, an outspoken critic of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who was
deposed as Haiti's leader on Sept. 17, said in a statement read
Monday over church-run Radio Soleil that he was told to leave Haiti
by Oct. 17.
   He did not say who issued the order for him to leave or whether
he would obey, and could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
   Two of his friends, however, said Aristide received a letter
last Saturday from his Salecian Order superiors in Rome ordering
his transfer to St. Clair parish in Montreal.
   ``He is packing his bags,'' said Paul Dejean, director of the
Karo Leveque Center, a social works group.
   Stephan Francisque, a former Salecian priest who now is a social
worker, said Aristide received the letter ``from the correct
channels in Rome.''
   Radio Soleil reported Tuesday that 30 Catholic priests sent a
telegram to the order asking that Aristide be allowed to stay.
   A leftist organization, the National Popular Assembly, called
for a demonstration Friday in solidarity with Aristide. Previous
rumors of his departure from Haiti inspired demonstrations.
   Those who attacked Aristide's church were identified later as
Tonton Macoutes, members of the Duvalier dictatorship's brutal
private army. President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country in
February 1986, ending 29 years of rule by himself and his father
Francois, known as ``Papa Doc.''
   Soldiers who ousted Namphy and installed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
as president cited the massacre as one major reason for the coup.
   Aristide repeatedly denounced state-sponsored terrorism and
repression and advocates liberation theology, which holds that the
church should speak out against social injustice. Aristide calls
that ``active non-violence.''
   The Vatican does not support liberation theology and Aristide
has been warned before.
   A message sent to him by Haiti's bishops last Sunday said:
``There are not two churches; there is one.''
   The Salecians told Aristide to leave Haiti at least once
previously, but their letter arrived a day after the church
massacre and the priest was told he could stay.
   The Rev. Jean Marie, spokesman for the papal nuncio, Monsignor
Paolo Romeo, said the Vatican had ``nothing to do'' with Aristide's
transfer.
   On Sept. 30, supporters of the priest marched from the rubble of
St. Jean Bosco to the nuncio's suburban residence and accused Rome
of plotting Aristide's transfer.

   The Soviet Union embraced the ecology
movement on Tuesday after years of indifference and declared
protection of the environment second only to the need to prevent
nuclear war.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky also announced, at
a news conference devoted entirely to ecology, that the Soviet
Union two days ago ratified the 1987 Montreal treaty on protecting
the ozone layer.
   Petrovsky told reporters that life on earth ``transcended
ideological differences.''
   He called for an environmental summit meeting of 15 to 20 top
world leaders, proposed a series of international meetings on the
environment and said funds saved from disarmament should be used to
upgrade the environment.
   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union would follow international laws
and regulations concerning the environment, including compensation
that could be paid for environmental accidents, like the Chernobyl
nuclear plant disaster.
   Moscow has seldom, if ever before, championed environmental
causes and has been notably absent from joining international
ecological decrees. The Soviets have been known more for exporting
arms and building heavy, often polluting, industry in the Third
World.
   Now, Moscow says, saving the Amazon rain forests, ending toxic
waste dumping in Africa and saving endangered species are high on
its list of priorities.
   The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 awakened his government to the
dangers of nuclear radiation and a broad policy debate was under
way, Petrovsky said.
   The pollution of Lake Baykal in Asia and dangerous emissions by
automobiles also were serious problems and would be addressed, he
said in answer to questions about what the Soviet Union would do in
its own territory.
   ``Ensuring environmental security has become second only to
eliminating the nuclear risk in the battle for the survival of
mankind,'' said Petrovsky, who is attending the 43rd General
Assembly.
   His statement echoed the words of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze, who devoted more time to the environment than to
disarmament in his recent speech to the assembly.
   Petrovsky called protection of the environment an example of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new political thinking''
and an important part of a new comprehensive system of
international peace and security.
   He said that just as the world must transcend blocs and national
politics to save the world from nuclear war, so it also must
address environmental problems on a global scale.
   Petrovsky said, ``The biosphere does not accept discussion from
strength, division of the world into systems and blocs. It
transcends ideological differences.''
   He proposed an International Environmental Security Fund,
channeling funds from phased-out or defunct military programs into
ecological concerns. He proposed the United Nations play a larger
role in safeguarding the environment and said ``an international
mechanism'' must be created to work out solutions regarding urgent
ecological problems.
   Petrovsky proposed three emergency meetings under U.N. auspices:
   _In 1989 a meeting of international experts on the health of the
earth.
   _In 1990 a meting of the top leaders of 15 to 20 nations
representing all continents and the Non-Aligned Movement.
   _A second U.N. international conference on the environment to be
attended by heads of state and government, before the 1992 target
date.
   Petrovsky also said the international community should adopt
binding principles and rules of behavior. He said these would
include broad exchange of information on ecological questions;
mutual access to advanced technologies, and strict accountability
of states for their environmental protection activities and
ecological accidents.

   Backers of Eugene McCarthy's independent
campaign for president filed papers Tuesday to certify him as a
write-in candidate in Arizona.
   Arizona coordinator Stockton Wingo said McCarthy is on the
ballot in only four or five states but he has qualified as a
write-in in another 15 states or so and plans to make the filing
deadlines in additional states.
   McCarthy, a former U.S. senator from Minnesota, first came to
national prominence in 1968 when his opposition to the Vietnam war
and his Democratic Party candidacy for president helped drive
then-President Lyndon Johnson from the race.
   Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, beat McCarthy for the
nomination at a riot-torn national convention in Chicago but lost
the election to Republican Richard Nixon.

<HEAD>With AM-Nuclear Problems, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savannah River Plant is moving ahead with
plans to ship some of its radioactive waste to New Mexico and a new
federal report estimates environmental cleanup costs at the plant
could reach $6.5 billion.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said the Savannah River plant and four other Department of Energy
nuclear plants should be added to the National Priority List, which
would mandate schedules for environmental cleanup.
   One Energy Department plant, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California, is already on the list.
   The list is corollary to a list of Superfund projects that need
quick cleanup. Federal plants are not eligible for Superfund
cleanups, which are administered by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   The GAO cites an Energy Department estimate of $285 million to
clean up 69 waste sites at the Savannah River Plant, but says
recent information from the Energy Department's headquarters in
Washington indicates the total cleanup cost could be as high as
$6.5 billion.
   Energy Department officials at Savannah River and in Washington
said the cleanup would probably cost between $300 million and $400
million, unless the department is required to package hazardous
waste there and remove it from the site.
   The cost could then run in the billions of dollars, they said.
For all waste sites at the six Energy Department plants, the GAO
cited estimates of up to $60 billion.
   The Energy Department released an environmental assessment
report Monday on a proposed ``transuranic'' waste facility at
Savannah River.
   That facility would prepare Savannah River waste for shipment,
starting next year, to the department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
near Carlsbad, N.M.
   The Energy Department report said the New Mexico plant, which
has not yet begun receiving shipments, would eventually remove a
potential source of groundwater contamination from the plant _
thousands of cubic feet of stored waste, containing elements
heavier than uranium, which are called transuranic.
   Plutonium, manufactured at the plant for use in nuclear weapons,
is one example of a transuranic element.
   In addition to the Savannah River and Livermore plants, the GAO
named Hanford Reservation in Washington, Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory, Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, and the Y-12 Plant in
Tennessee as plants that should be added to the cleanup list.
   Environmental problems, including contamination of groundwater
with radioactive, chemical and other hazardous substances, were
found at all six sites, the GAO said.
   In some cases, the contamination was detected at levels hundreds
to thousands of times above federal drinking water standards.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress on Tuesday completed final action on
a bill to extend and tighten controls on clinical laboratories to
make sure they are doing accurate and reliable testing work.
   The Senate approved the bill on a voice vote, sending the
measure to President Reagan for his signature. The House passed it
last week.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said the new law will set standards for
virtually all labs and give the Department of Health and Human
Services new enforcement tools.
   The bill was prompted by reports of problems, sometimes
life-threatening, at unregulated labs doing shoddy work. Sponsors
were particularly concerned about labs in doctor's offices, which
had been exempt from existing federal regulation.
   Dingell said the new law will set strict standards for Pap
smears, require dissemination of information on lab performance,
and set new civil and criminal penalties for labs that violate
regulations. A new and tougher method of evaluating lab performance
would be instituted.
   The bill also would strengthen federal oversight of the
professional organizations that have been largely responsible for
monitoring lab performance.
   Some flexibility would be given to labs that only perform tests
in which erroneous results would not pose a significant risk to
patients.
   Pap test regulations would include workload limits for those
reading the slides; improperly collected specimens would be
returned to doctors; and slides of women in high-risk groups would
be rescreened before a diagnosis was made.

<TEXT>
   Sikh militants killed 13 people in
Punjab Tuesday, including a leader of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
Congress Party, two days before Gandhi's planned visit there, Press
Trust of India news agency reported.
   The extremists in northern Punjab state are fighting for an
independent Sikh nation.
   PTI said Bhagwan Dass, vice president of the Punjab state unit
of the Congress Party, his bodyguard and an unidentified man were
killed at Jaito Mandi in Faridkot district by five Sikh gunmen.
Faridkot is about 185 miles northwest of New Delhi.
   Gandhi is scheduled to visit Punjab on Thursday for a personal
assessment of flood damage there. Recent floods killed 462 people
in Punjab and three other northern states.
   Dass was a government minister in the party-led government in
Punjab in 1980.
   Other deaths at the hands of Sikh attackers were reported from
Ropar district, where two policemen were killed. Three people were
killed in Amritsar, one in Jalandhar, two in Ferozpur and two in
Bhatinda district.
   At least 13 people also were killed Tuesday in sectarian
violence in the north Indian town of Muzaffarnagar, 78 miles north
of New Delhi, the United News of India reported.
   It said the adminstration called in the army with orders to
shoot rioters on sight. UNI said Indian army units moved in after
new violence led to fears of violence escalating and spreading to
other areas.
   Indian news media did not specify the parties involved, as media
norms here prohibit mention of warring religious groups. But
informed sources in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Hindus and Moslems were involved in the riots.
   State-owned Indian television, Doordarshan, said 200 people were
arrested in the town on Tuesday. UNI said a curfew, which bars
people from streets, was imposed there Tuesday.
   The agency quoted an Uttar Pradesh state government police
official as saying the situation in Muzaffarnagar was
''explosive.'' It did not elaborate.

   The shutdown of plutonium processing at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant because of a safety violation
follows repeated complaints by workers, citizens' groups and the
government that management had a cavalier attitude toward health
and safety.
   Jim Wilson, who heads a state-appointed monitoring commission on
radioactive waste at Rocky Flats, called the shutdown Saturday
symbolic of the Department of Energy's new attention to problems at
the country's aging nuclear weapons plants.
   He gave the DOE credit for ``taking the offensive.''
   Tom Rauch of Citizens Against Rocky Flats Contamination, a
grassroots group formed last year to protest the proposed
incineration of radioactive wastes at Rocky Flats, saw the shutdown
as a slap at plant management.
   ``It simply confirms what many people have said all along _ that
safety and health problems at the plant are greater than the DOE
and Rockwell (International Corp., which operates the plant) have
been willing to admit,'' he said.
   DOE shut down the main plutonium processing room at Rocky Flats,
16 miles northwest of Denver. The plant, which employs about 6,000
people, uses highly radioactive plutonium to make triggers for
nuclear weapons.
   Rockwell spokesman Pat Etchart said Tuesday the closure of the
processing room has had little effect on production at Rocky Flats.
   ``We have 100 major buildings out here. If this is short-term,
it will have minimal effect on the plant operation. If it is longer
term, yes, it could significantly impact production efforts,'' he
said.
   It was the second major suspension of nuclear weapons production
in two months. Three reactors at the Savannah River Plant in South
Carolina were shut down in August because of safety concerns.
   The DOE has made no plans for either plant to reopen.
   The shutdown in Building 771 at Rocky Flats apparently stems
from a Sept. 29 incident in which a Rockwell supervisor and two
employees entered a building without respirators because a warning
sign was blocked from view.
   Richard W. Starostecki, the deputy assistant energy secretary
for safety, health and quality assurance, told a Washington news
conference that the decision to close the facility stemmed from an
incident on Sept. 29.
   A department inspector and two Rockwell employees entered a room
in which workers were cleaning up radioactive contamination but had
not posted the required warning signs, said Starostecki.
   The workers in the room were wearing protective clothing and
masks, but the inspector and the two Rockwell employeers were not,
Starostecki said. Two of them had ``positive nasal smears, which
means that there was some degree of contamination.''
   ``We do not view this as life threatening,'' said Starostecki.
``We are trying to quantify the amount of material they might have
breathed in.''
   Rocky Flats has been inspected by the DOE three times since
1986. The most recent DOE report found pervasive inadequacies in
worker protection, fire protection, maintenance and repeated
failure by Rockwell to address the department's previous concerns.
   ``The large number of repeat concerns from previous technical
safety appraisals of Rocky Flats facilities found in this appraisal
raises questions regarding management's full commitment to, and-or
involvement with safety,'' the report said.
   Rockwell spokeswoman Carol Groves said Tuesday the company had
``re-emphasized'' safety in the past couple of months and had
restructured some departments such as radiation monitoring to
improve performance.
   ``Safety is the highest priority at this plant,'' she said.
``Where there are safety problems, management has to take
responsibility. It's not that it's lax, but we can always stand
improvement.''
   Among other recent episodes in the plant's troubled history are:
   _ Officials of the United Steel Workers, Local 8031, announced
in March 1987 that safety complaints had jumped nearly sixfold in
the previous five years.
   _ A May 1987 DOE report said workers at Rocky Flats were
operating under questionable safety standards and were performing
hazardous jobs without proper guidance. The report capped a federal
investigation into the death of a Rocky Flats electrician.
   _ Rockwell proposed a test burn of radioactive and chemical
wastes at Rocky Flats in early 1987. Mounting public opposition and
a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and Rauch's citizens group
resulted in the DOE shelving the burn pending an environmental
assessment.
   _ Allegations that Rocky Flats employees operated a ``model
shop'' there as a sideline and made $1 million worth of gadgets and
trinkets over 17 years.
   _ A Feb. 12 DOE study found sloppy work habits, faulty equipment
and lax attitudes at the plant had created ``significant safety
concerns.''
   _ In May, the DOE ripped Rockwell's management, saying
inattentiveness and disorganization had caused safety problems.
   _ In late May, radioactive and hazardous material spilled from
several defective concrete containers which had deteriorated to the
consistency of mayonnaise, state health officials said.
   _ In June, Rockwell was fined for safety violations, including
failure to report fires and improper handling of stored waste.
   _ In June, EPA reported 103 past waste disposal areas at Rocky
Flats that needed to be cleaned up. A DOE study in July found the
government would have to spend more than $900 million there by 1995
to comply with safety and health laws and clean up pollution.
   _ On July 22, 12 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste
spilled, but plant officials waited a week before reporting it.
   _ In August it was revealed that DOE officials earlier had
considered shutting down the plant entirely because of repeated
safety violations and because of Rockwell's managers' and
employees' ``lax attitudes.''

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said Tuesday he will file
suit against a black teen-ager and her three advisers who falsely
accused him of involvement in an alleged sexual assault against her.
   Steven Pagones, a Dutchess County assistant district attorney,
was cleared by a grand jury of accusations he sexually attacked
Tawana Brawley, 16, formerly of nearby Wappingers Falls.
   The grand jury concluded Miss Brawley made up her story she was
attacked by six white men last year. The girl's advisers, without
offering evidence, had accused Pagones of being one of the
attackers.
   Pagones said lawyers are preparing a lawsuit that will be filed
within a month against Miss Brawley, the Rev. Al Sharpton and
attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr.
   Pagones had harsh words for the Brawley advisers, labeling their
verbal attacks as ``blatant, disgusting and deplorable lies.''
   Miss Brawley, who never cooperated with the grand jury during
its seven-month investigation, was found in Wappingers Falls last
Nov. 28 smeared with dog feces and with racial slurs scrawled on
her body. Wappingers Falls is about 70 miles north of New York City.
   Pagones announced the lawsuit at a news conference, which
Sharpton tried to interrupt by shouting through a hotel doorway,
``I'm here, Pagones. Your accuser's here. Why don't you give me the
papers?''
   A hotel employee closed the door on Sharpton and held it closed
for the rest of the news conference.
   Hayes would not say how much the lawsuit would be for, only that
it would be ``millions of dollars.''
   Pagones said he will also file a grievance against Mason and
Maddox and will seek discipline against the two lawyers for
``knowingly making false statements of law and fact.''
   ``I feel they should be disbarred,'' he said.
   Last week, state Attorney General Robert Abrams announced that
he asked for investigations of the lawyers for possible
disciplinary action.
   Miss Brawley denounced the grand jury's report, as did Sharpton,
Mason and Maddox.
   During the grand jury investigation, Pagones was questioned
about a friend of his, Harry Crist Jr., a part-time Fishkill
policeman who committed suicide three days after Miss Brawley was
found.
   Glenda Brawley, Tawana's mother, raised questions about Crist's
possible involvement in her daughter's alleged attack, but Crist
was also cleared by the grand jury.
   During the grand jury investigation, Pagones testified that he
and Crist were at a Connecticut shopping mall the day Miss Brawley
was found.
   ``They have made the past six months a living hell for the
parents and family of Harry Crist,'' Pagones said.
   He also criticized the media, calling it the ``life support
system'' for Sharpton, Maddox and Mason.
   ``This charade will not end until the media ends it,'' he said.

   Moslem legislators on Tuesday called for
a prompt presidential election, echoing a group of Christian
lawmakers and raising hopes of ending a major constitutional crisis.
   The 16 pro-Syrian members of Parliament also rejected any kind
of partition and ruled out the rehabilitation of an estimated
500,000 Palestinians in south Lebanon.
   In a statement the group urged ``speedy and strong efforts to
break the presidential election deadlock and overcome the obstacles
and hardships that still prevail.''
   A similar call was made Monday by 29 Christian deputies who said
they had authorized Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, head of the dominant
Maronite Catholic community, to negotiate with rival Moslems to
elect a new head of state.
   The political crisis was triggered after Parliament failed three
times to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel before his
6-year term expired Sept. 23. The Christians boycotted all three
sessions of Parliament, prompted by Syrian efforts to promote an
ally for president.
   The power vaccuum resulted in two interim governments, one
Christian, one Moslem, each claiming legitimacy.
   The Christian deputies said the new president's mandate should
``reject all forms of partition and rehabilitation.''
   Both groups of lawmakers stressed that the presidential vote
should take place before Oct. 18, when Parliament Speaker Hussein
Husseini's term runs out.
   Between them, the Moslem and Christian legislators total 45,
only six short of the quorum needed to hold an electoral session of
Parliament.
   Parliament has 99 seats. But there are only 76 members still
alive after 13 years of civil war.
   There have been no parliamentary elections since 1972 and the
House has repeatedly renewed its mandate since then.
   The statements by the two groups suggested that they may be
ready to seek a compromise candidate for president, provided that
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, responds favorably.
   If a president and speaker are not elected soon, Parliament is
likely to disintegrate and the de facto partition of this
Mediterranean country would be likely be formalized.
   Parliament has not convened since Aug. 18.
   Syria, which supports the Moslems and their leftist allies, has
been pressing for the election of either ex-president Suleiman
Franjieh, a 78-year-old Christian warlord closely allied with
Damascus, or pro-Syrian deputy Mikhail Daher, 58, also a Christian.
   Right-wing Christians have vetoed both candidates, claiming they
are too heavily committed to the Syrians, who maintain 40,000
troops in north and east Lebanon and Beirut's Moslem sector.
   Under an unwritten covenant dating from 1943 when Lebanon gained
independence from France, Maronites have held the posts of
president, army commander and central bank governor.
   The prime minister hs traditionally been a Sunni and the
Parliament speaker a Shiite.

   Gunmen burst into a Belfast ice
cream parlor Tuesday and opened fire, killing an off-duty policeman
and injuring a man and a woman, police reported.
   The attack occurred an hour after two shots were fired at a
British army foot patrol in the predominantly Catholic Lenadoon
area of west Belfast. The soldiers returned one shot. Nobody was
reported injured in that incident.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the policeman's
death, but suspicion inevitably fell on the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   None of the victims was immediately identified. There was no
indication whether the gunmen targeted the man and woman or whether
they were shot accidentally.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters, who in
accordance with British practice spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the lives of the two injured people were not in danger.
   The ice cream parlor is off Lisburn Road, a main traffic artery
in south Belfast where sectarian divides are not as strictly
observed as in other parts of the city.
   The death of the policeman brings to at least 2,700 the death
toll since sectarian and political violence flared in Northern
Ireland 20 years ago.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.

   An Air Force tanker plane crashed Tuesday
afternoon at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, killing six people and
injuring 10 others, authorities said.
   A KC-135 Stratotanker used to refuel other planes went down at
2:20 p.m. as it was returning to the base from a mission to K.I.
Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, said Staff
Sgt. Donald Lawber, a spokesman at the air base in the northeastern
Lower Peninsula.
   Eight of the 10 injured were treated at the base hospital, Sgt.
Darryle Moody said. He said the two people admitted to the base
hospital were in good condition Tuesday night.
   Moody said all the people aboard the plane were military
personnel.
   Base firefighters had just completed a training exercise prior
to the crash, said Sgt. Gene Babble, who added that a crew
responded to douse the flames almost immediately.
   Reports received by the Pentagon indicated the plane was
carrying six crewmen and 10 passengers, said Lt. Col. Rick O'Born,
a Pentagon spokesman in Washington, D.C.
   The four-engine plane was reported to be on fire at the end of
the runway at about 3 p.m., he said.
   Fire dispatcher Karen Kaiser said emergency crews were sent to
the crash site and roads leading to the base were closed.
   A mechanic at a muffler shop near the base, who only gave his
name as Ron, said the fire had been extinguished when he drove past
the crash site at 3:45 p.m.
   ``The only thing left of the plane was the tail and part of a
wing,'' he said. ``There was only the skeleton of the fusulage
left. There were pieces all over the place.''
   It wasn't known what the plane's mission was at the time of the
crash, Senior Airman Michael Blair said. He said the identities of
the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   According to a U.S Air Force fact sheet, the KC-135 is a
military version of the Boeing 707 transport and can fly at near
sonic speed and at altitudes up to 50,000 feet, allowing receiver
aircraft to onload fuel without slowing down or descending to lower
altitudes where jet engines burn fuel more rapidly.

<HEAD>Soviet Jewish Couple Allowed To Emigrate After Politician's Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet Jewish couple long denied permission to
emigrate has been told they can leave, following their appeal for
help last week to a British Cabinet minister visiting the Soviet
Union, officials said Tuesday.
   Eduard Nadgorny, 57, and his wife, Nina, both scientists,
telephoned the British Embassy in Moscow on Monday to say Soviet
authorities promised the necessary emigration papers would be
prepared in the next few weeks, Britain's Department of Education
said.
   Education Secretary Kenneth Baker met the couple and seven other
refuseniks at a breakfast at the British Embassy Oct. 4 during his
seven-day tour of education facilities in the Soviet Union.
   ``She said that her meeting with Mr. Baker could have given the
Soviet authorities the final push,'' a Department of Education
spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said of Mrs. Nadgorny.
   Baker subsequently asked Yuri Marchuk, president of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, to press emigration authorities for all nine
refuseniks to receive travel documents.
   ``I am delighted they (the Nadgornys) are to be allowed to
emigrate. It is marvelous news,'' Baker said Tuesday on the first
day of the ruling Conservative Party conference in Brighton, 50
miles south of London.
   ``I hope now that two have come that others might also get
permission to leave,'' he said.
   Refusenik is the name given to people who have applied for
permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union and been denied.
   Nadgorny lost his job as a physicist shortly after he and his
wife applied for emigration visas in 1981. The applications were
denied on grounds that they held information vital to the Soviet
Union.
   The couple staged hunger strikes to protest the refusal, but
were again denied permission to leave earlier this year to join
their 26-year-old son, Boris, a scientist at Princeton University
in New Jersey.
   In a telephone interview with the British domestic news agency
Press Association, Nadgorny thanked Baker for speaking to the
Soviet authorities.
   ``My wife and I kissed each other'' when the visa department
told them their official exit papers would be ready within two or
three weeks, Nadgorny was quoted as saying.
   ``We want to leave here as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``We hope it will be before the new year.''
   They expect to join their son before deciding where to settle,
Nadgorny said.
   Some of Nadgorny's writings have been smuggled out of the Soviet
Union and published in Britain. Mrs. Nadgorny is a leader of the
refusenik pressure group ``Women in Refusal'' and serves as a
correspondent for the London-based weekly Jewish Chronicle
newspaper.

   A Cuban gunboat seized a 156-foot supply ship
carrying New Zealand's entry in the America's Cup race and detained
eight United States citizens Tuesday, the Coast Guard said.
   The Tampa Sea Horse, a New Orleans-based ship, was sailing about
12 miles off the southeastern tip of Cuba when the gunboat
approached and seized the ship, said Coast Guard spokesman Dan
Vogeley.
   The ship's agent, Zapata Marine of New Orleans, later told the
Coast Guard in Miami that the America's Cup entry, the New Zealand,
was aboard the ship, which was en route from Long Beach, Calif., to
New York City.
   There were no reports of shots fired or use of force, and the
ship and crew were taken without further incident to Cayo Mola,
Cuba, Vogeley said.
   The master of the ship disputed the Cuban navy's claim that the
vessel was inside the island nation's 12-mile territorial waters
limit and placed an urgent call to the Coast Guard at about 3 p.m.
EDT. Coast Guard officers advised the master to comply, Vogeley
said.
   Lowell Oswald, spokesman for Zapata Marine, said he doesn't know
why the ship was seized but insisted it was in international waters.
   ``We're at as much of a loss as anyone else,'' he said.
   He estimated the Tampa Sea Horse's value at $3 million but said
he didn't know what the sailing vessel was worth.
   ``Hopefully, they'll let us go tonight and they'll keep going to
New York,'' he said. ``There's no way to really tell.''
   The ship was escorted to the port ``for inspection purposes,''
said Maggie Kerrigan, a spokeswoman at the New Zealand consulate in
Los Angeles.
   The passenger list supplied to the Coast Guard by Zapata listed
all eight on board as Americans, but Kerrigan said one New
Zealander also was on ship.
   ``We feel that after a brief inspection they will probably be
released,'' said U.S. State Department press officer Ben Justesen
in Washington, D.C.
   If the crew is detained for an extended period, the State
Department would seek counselor access to the crew through the U.S.
diplomatic mission in Havana, he said.
   Kerrigan said New Zealand officials have asked the State
Department and Coast Guard to help gain the vessel's release.
   ``They are confident of no significant delay'' in winning
release of both vessels, said Kerrigan.
   ``We understand this type of incident has, on occasion, occurred
in the past with U.S. ships (sailing through) the passage between
Cuba and the Dominican Republic,'' Kerrigan said.
   The chairman of the New Zealand Challenge, Michael Fay, was not
aboard the ship. Fay forced the San Diego Yacht Club into an early
defense of the Cup this year after winning a court order that
validated his challenge of the race rules.
   The sloop Fay used in the race was twice as long as the
traditional 12-meter yachts used in Cup competitions. The San Diego
Yacht Club responded by building a dual-hulled catamaran to defend
the Cup, and Dennis Conner skippered the Stars & Stripes to two
easy victories over the Kiwis to sweep a best-of-three series.
   A catamaran had never before been used in the 137-year history
of the Cup.
   Fay is planning to return to the New York court holding
jurisdiction over America's Cup disputes to seek forfeiture of the
Cup on grounds that the San Diego Yacht Club used an allegedly
illegal defender.

   A fire broke out Tuesday at Central Library,
which has been closed since two arson fires in 1986 damaged
thousands of books at the nation's second largest library, an
official said.
   The fire began about 5:10 p.m. and was extinguished about a half
hour later, said assistant Fire Chief Gerald Johnson.
   The 62-year-old Central Library in the downtown financial
district was hit by two arson fires that damaged its extensive
collection in 1986. The first fire destroyed 375,000 books and
caused $22 million in damage. The second destroyed 25,000 books for
an additional $2 million in damage.
   Some 900,000 books have been repaired.
   The library operations moved while the main library undergoes
expansion and renovation.
   Tuesday's fire apparently started somewhere in the basement
where construction materials were stored.

<HEAD>Town Mourns Traffic Deaths Of Five Girls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PULASKI, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crying schoolchildren hugged and hundreds
of friends and neighbors gathered Tuesday in a high school
gymnasium in this rural town to mourn the deaths of five girls who
were struck by a speeding car.
   Dozens of floral arrangements surrounded the five caskets in the
Pulaski High School gymnasium for a community memorial service for
the girls. Nearby, collages depicting each girl's life stood on
easels.
   President Reagan sent his condolences to this community of about
1,900 about 15 miles northwest of Green Bay. ``Nancy and I join
with each and every one of you as you mourn the loss of five
precious young lives,'' Reagan said in a message delivered by Rep.
Toby Roth, R-Wis.
   The girls were killed when a car went out of control Friday,
sheared off a utility pole and struck them as they stood on the
sidewalk. The five victims were: Nicole Watia, 12, and Brenda
Hylok, Laura Karcz, Jessica McKeefry and Jodi Prokop, all 13. All
were seventh graders and from Pulaski.
   Funerals for the girls were planned for Wednesday.
   Organizers of the memorial service collected poems, letters,
drawings and a tape recording made by the girls to share with the
mourners.
   Brenda's sister, Connie Krueger, read a poem her sister wrote
about love.
   ``You're asking me to stay,'' the poem said. ``Please don't go
away. My heart would never mend, so stay with me until the end.''
   Many mourners wiped tears when Nicole's recorded voice sang out,
``The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think of
what could have been, it makes me want to cry.''
   James Brawner, principal of Glenbrook Elementary School,
estimated more than 2,000 people filed past the caskets before the
service.
   Police said no alcohol was involved in the accident.
Investigators had not determined by Tuesday why the car was
traveling an estimated 70 mph.
   Investigators planned to study the 1975 Cadillac for any
possible mechanical failure this week and hoped to speak with the
17-year-old driver next week, said Police Chief Reed Woodward.
   ``If we rule out mechanical problems, then, of course, we will
begin looking at (possible) medical problems,'' said the chief. He
had said earlier police would investigate the possibility the
driver suffered a seizure of some sort before the accident.
   The driver, Scott Karcz, a high school junior, was in critical
condition at a Green Bay hospital Monday. Hospital officials said
Tuesday his parents had asked that no further reports be given on
his condition. His 11-year-old sister, a passenger in the car, was
also seriously injured.
   Scott Karcz is a distant relative of Laura Karcz, one of the
victims.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argonne National Laboratory has sold a process
that could dramatically reduce pollution from coal-fire power
plants to a Pennsylvania company, lab officials said Tuesday.
   The buyer, Dravo Lime Co., of Pittsburgh, which makes chemicals
for smokestack scrubbers, is betting that tighter acid-rain
controls will make the deal a profitable one.
   Officials say the process can be used with existing equipment to
reduce by 70 percent a plant's output of nitrogen oxide _ believed,
along with sulfur oxides, to be a major cause of acid rain.
   ``The driving force on all this is the potential of new
legislation on acid rain,'' said David Livengood, an Argonne
researcher who managed the project.
   Acid rain, formed when the sulfur and nitrogen gases combine
with the air to form acids, is believed to cause widespread damage
to forests and lakes.
   The new process, called Argonox, involves spraying water mixed
with substances called ``metal chelates'' into a chamber through
which coal smoke must pass. The metal chelates then combine with
nitrogen to form a solid substance that can be removed from the
chamber and hauled away.
   Dravo says the new technology will pay for itself because power
plants seeking to comply with tougher acid-rain laws will prefer
the Argonox system, which can be fitted to existing scrubbers, to
other methods requiring costly equipment changes.
   Scrubbers, which use lime to remove sulfur oxides from coal
smoke, have been installed at many power plants and other
industries.
   Dravo spokesman Ron Sommer said the company expected to have a
pilot project installed at the Miami Fort power plant near
Cincinnati sometime in the next year.
   Dravo bought the process from Argonne, a Department of Energy
lab in suburban Lemont operated by the University of Chicago, as
part of a program encouraging the sale of the fruits of government
research to private industry.

   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of

than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The 349 others in Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans were

$1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who

   Iranians involved in the Iran-Contra affair
thought George Bush was the ``most powerful man in the world'' and
the person pulling the strings from behind the scenes, according to
a new book.
   The book is written by Michael A. Ledeen, a former consultant to
the National Security Council who played a role in the earliest
stages of the affair. He says the Iranians overestimated Bush's
importance because the vice president was a former director of the
CIA, which they considered to be the root of ultimate power in the
United States.
   Ledeen says his book is an attempt to shed light on how the
Iran-Contra affair happened and ``set the record straight about
myself and my role in the affair.''
   ``Perilous Statecraft: An Insider's Account of the Iran-Contra
Affair'' is published by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book mixes
Ledeen's firsthand view of certain events, his opinions and his
interpretation of material that was uncovered during congressional
hearings in the summer of 1987.

   Lax security at Energy Department nuclear

congressional investigators reported today.
   The visits took place at the national laboratories at Los Alamos

scientists conduct advanced research on nuclear weapons and the
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, according to a
congressional report.
   The foreign visitors included specialists from the Soviet bloc,
China and nations which are believed either to have nuclear weapons
or are seeking to develop them, including India, Pakistan, Israel,
Brazil and Argentina.
   Officials at the FBI and CIA declined to discuss possible
espionage investigations stemming from the incidents and it was not
clear whether any secrets had been lost, according to the report by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

   When Richard Wagner put him on the operatic stage
in 1845, Tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many
_ the pagan goddess of love. Now, he's a television evangelist with
the same problem.
   The goddess in Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhauser,''
which premiered Monday evening at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, lives
in a sleazy Las Vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing only
their bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of Act 1.
   Tannhauser himself, sung by tenor Richard Cassilly, bears a
certain resemblance to the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.
   Tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremony
at a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the Rev. Robert
Schuller's headquarters in California. In February, Swaggart
confessed to committing unspecified sins against his family and
God, while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude in
a motel room.

   At one point in ``A Perfect Spy,'' British
intelligence officer Magnus Pym is told by Axel, his symbiotic
partner in East-West espionage, ``You are a perfect spy. All you
need is a cause. I have one.''
   Pym rejects Axel's attempt to recruit him ideologically. For
him, the game is career enhancement _ and the thrill of the scam.
But Pym's search for an inner cause is a continuing theme in John
Le Carre's best seller, which was also a thinly veiled account of
the author's relationship with his real-life father.
   The best seller is brought to the screen with perfection in the
seven-part BBC series that can be see on PBS beginning Sunday, one
hour a week.
   This intricate and moody piece owes its success to screenwriter
Arthur Hopcraft's adaptation of the book. The novel began with
Pym's disappearance from his post in Vienna, then alternately told
of his earlier life and of his British superiors' efforts to locate
him.
   Hopcraft, who previously adapted Le Carre's ``Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy,'' also for the BBC, tells Pym's life in
straightforward, chronological order. But instead of
oversimplifying the tale, his script, combined with Peter Smith's
direction, draws the viewer into the story, so prepare to be hooked.
   Ray McAnally is superb as Rick Pym, the con man based on Le
Carre's father, Ronnie Cornwell. (Le Carre's real name is David
Cornwell.) Peter Egan is the adult Magnus. Rudiger Weigang, an
excellent German actor, plays Axel. Alan Howard is Jack
Brotherhood, the British agent who recruits Magnus. Jane Booker
plays Mary, Magnus' perfect diplomatic wife. Peggy Ashcroft is Miss
Dubber, the keeper of the seaside boarding house where Pym goes to
hide.
   The miniseries begins with Magnus as a young boy (played by
twins Nicholas and Jonathan Haley), watching his beloved father
hauled away by the police for embezzlement. His delicate mother
cracks under the strain and is also taken away, to a mental
institution. Magnus' father later rescues him from a stern uncle
and begins his education in deception.
   Benedict Taylor plays the college-age Magnus, who fumbles his
father's assignment to travel to Switzerland and fleece a
``baroness'' who turns out to be the superior con artist. Rather
than return and face his father, Magnus enrolls in a Swiss college.
It is there he meets Axel, a left-wing Czech poet, and encounters
Brotherhood and is recruited by British intelligence.
   Eventually, Pym is drawn into an arrangement with Axel that has
him bargaining with his own country's secrets. Together he and Axel
conspire to get themselves posted to the Disneyland of spydom _
America.
   Continually surfacing is Rick Pym, the ultimate charmer, who
cons his son along with the other pigeons, imbuing him with the
need to always go for the one last swindle that will ``see you
right.''
   In a 1986 article in the London Sunday Times, Le Carre described
the emotions that led him to write an account of his late father's
life, albeit as part of a fictional spy story:
   ``So what broke the code for me? What enabled me to write about
Ronnie at last? In part, it was the sheer effort of thinking about
him for so long. Had I loved him or hated him? It no longer
mattered. I had done both so amply that the distinctions had
disappeared, and with them any thought of judgment.
   ``I had fled from his delusions only to find them reproduced all
around me in the sleeping castles of secret England where I had
taken refuge. I had met bigger wreckers than Ronnie, bigger
hypocrites and bigger liars, dressed in the trappings of high
office and still rising, with index-linked pensions and knighthoods
to take them into old age. The difference was, they lied out of
obedience to some ill-perceived higher cause, and did their
wrecking in the name of service.''

   In offering a home-buying program, Gov. Michael
Dukakis has focused on an issue that conceivably could be decisive
in how certain groups vote.
   Among them are voters in the 20- to 40-year age brackets, and
young singles and couples who want to own but rent instead because
they cannot afford the down payments.
   It is an all-American issue, along with flag and parenthood,
intertwined with ideals Americans admire, including individualism,
independence, freedom, security, wholesome family life and success.
   But if it is an all-American goal, it is a faltering one. Home
ownership isn't what it used to be. After climbing from 43.6
percent in 1940 to 65.8 percent in the third quarter of 1985, it
now rests at 63.7 percent.
   The full significance of those numbers isn't apparent, however,
until the breakdown is analyzed. Then it is found that the most
pronounced decline in home ownership is concentrated in the younger
households.
   In some respects, the figures suggest a growing split between
the haves and the have-nots, the former being the older households
who got into the market before the big price increases, and the
younger households who are shut out.
   Among the haves there is no group with a higher rate of home
ownership _ 80.7 percent _ than those aged 60 to 64. But every
five-year age group from 40 years to 75 years and older has an
ownership rate in excess of 70 percent.
   Now the contrast: Among those in the 25-29 age group, only 36.3
percent owned homes in the first quarter of 1988, according to the
National Association of Home Builders.
   Confronted with those numbers, some older homeowners contend
that younger people should not expect to own houses, often adding
that young folks today do not understand patience. ``Let them save
for it like I did,'' they say.
   But the fact is that it was easier for a young couple to buy a
house 15 years ago. Throughout the 1970s, the ownership rate in the
25-29 age group was regularly near or above 40 percent. Annual
declines were unknown.
   Since 1981 the ownership rate in that age group has declined
every year but 1984, and that exception was only by a small
fraction of a percent.
   In the age 30-34 category there has also been a sharp decline,
from 62.6 percent in 1978 to 52.8 percent in 1988's first quarter.
   Cold figures describe a hot issue.
   For one thing, it is households in these age categories that are
most often used to illustrate the American dream of happy
homeownership. The sense of denial, therefore, is enhanced by daily
repetition of what might have been.
   The have-nots pay rent instead, and rents sometimes take a huge
toll on savings. A report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies
of Harvard University notes that many households pay rent equal to
30 percent or even 50 percent of income.
   The obvious consequence _ one shared by the center _ is that
money spent on rent depletes savings that otherwise could have gone
toward the purchase of a home. Meanwhile, home prices rise,
demolishing the dream.
   Among the proposals made by Dukakis would be a major change in
Individual Retirement Accounts to allow first-time homebuyers to
use such funds in meeting down payments.
   At present, IRA funds accumulating free of annual taxes cannot
be used before the year in which a person turns 59{ years, except
by paying stiff financial penalties. Thus, they are almost useless
to first-time buyers.
   While those same funds cannot be invested in housing, because
housing, oddly, does not qualify as an ``investment'' for the
future, they can be left in stocks, bonds and a variety of
securites, even speculations.
   Those who believe IRAs can be made more versatile ask,
therefore, why such funds cannot be used in housing, which has been
perhaps the best long-term investment of all, not just for future
retirement but for present living.

<HEAD>Murders Are A Way Of Life For These Authors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven Levy's book is about a hippie-like New
Age guru who allegedly killed his girlfriend and stuffed her in a
trunk. Teresa Carpenter's book is about a professor who battered
his prostitute-mistress.
   When this husband and wife dine at night, does mayhem mingle
with the meatloaf? Not necessarily, they say.
   ``It would be wrong to suggest (our conversations) were
excessively morbid. They don't tend to be morose,'' says Levy.
   But Carpenter quickly adds, ``We could swap forensic stories and
I could tell him who he should talk to in the FBI.''
   For three years, Levy, 37, and Carpenter, 40, worked separately
but simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsive
crimes.
   The experience of both writing at the same time turned out quite
well, Carpenter said during a recent interview at the couple's
Fifth Avenue apartment, a well-lighted, book-filled home.
   In his book _ ``The Unicorn's Secret: Murder in the Age of
Aquarius,'' to be published this month by Prentice Hall Press _
Levy examined the bizarre case of Ira Einhorn, Philadelphia's
enigmatic peace-and-love freak and parapsychology crusader who was
charged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend, Holly Maddux. Eighteen
months after Maddux was last seen alive, her decomposed, mummified
body was found in a locked trunk in their apartment.
   Einhorn, known about town as ``The Unicorn,'' shrugged off the
allegations and accused the CIA and others of planting evidence in
his home, but he skipped bail before trial. He remains a fugitive,
likely living in Europe.
   Carpenter's book, ``Missing Beauty,'' published in June by W.W.
Norton, is the story of what led Tufts University medical
researcher William Douglas in 1983 to smash the skull of Robin
Benedict, the high-priced Boston prostitute with whom he'd fallen
insanely in love.
   Even though the essentials of the stories are similar _ both
victims were women trying to extract themselves from relationships
with obsessively possessive men _ the two men could not be more
unalike.
   The Unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure, a
ladies' man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to such
benign weirdness as answering his door stark naked. Though he
dressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans, sported a full beard and
shoulder-length hair and frequently smelled bad, Einhorn
established an incredible global network of scientists, corporate
sponsors and wealthy benefactors.
   ``Ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles,
was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he was
almost 40,'' says Levy. ``Douglas was this traditional, respected
man.''
   Superficially, Douglas did appear to lead a normal life: He was
a solidly middle-class family man with three children, an eminent
medical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture.
   ``Everything about him was so normal, so stultifyingly normal.
... He was a man who one would never imagine could have gotten
himself into a situation like this,'' Carpenter said.
   But then there was that other side, sufficiently dark, private
and perverse to fascinate the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for
four years. Carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crime
coverage for The Village Voice.
   Here was ``a scientist who had been embezzling research funds to
support a mistress _ who happened to be a hooker. He was living a
double life ... That's what hooked me,'' she said.
   Researching her book, Carpenter spent weeks walking the streets
and hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the Combat Zone,
the netherworld that is Boston's red-light district, talking to
bartenders, pimps, whores and strippers who knew Douglas' young
victim.
   ``That was very difficult for me. I'm not a street person and
never dared pose as one,'' she said.
   While Carpenter was exploring the gamy depths, Levy was having
anxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from Boston,
assuring him that she was safe.
   ``I wasn't happy about it, but this is what Teresa does. It's
important for her to do the story right,'' Levy said.
   ``Missing Beauty'' is Carpenter's first book, but she was
already a respected master of crime stories: She had reported on
the killings of Playmate Dorothy Stratton and politician Allard
Lowenstein.
   ``The Unicorn's Secret'' is Levy's first major excursion into
the genre; his other book, ``Hackers,'' is about the personal
computer revolution. Levy is a free-lance writer and contributing
editor for Rolling Stone.
   So, what is the allure of the macabre?
   Says Levy: ``When something happens it gives you a window into
the way people live, the way people are. ... It's like an
archaeological dig. Like if someone unearths a civilization frozen
by a volcano or something. That's what a murder does _ it freezes
details of our lives.''

<HEAD>Getting to Know Charlie Parker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Forest Whitaker, playing Charlie Parker
didn't just mean looking or sounding like the great jazzman. It
meant making sure everything fit.
   ``I was nervous. I was scared,'' admitted Whitaker, who stars in
``Bird,'' Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed film biography of
the late jazz saxophonist.
   ``I was going into areas I hadn't really dealt with. It was a
most challenging role. As a person, I felt really honored to bring
the character to life. It was so fortunate that it happened.''
   Parker, who died in 1955 when he was just 34, moved into musical
areas that few touched. With such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie, he
revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, helping create the style called
be-bop. A brilliant and troubled man, he was no less overwhelming
as a person.
   ``I think he embraced life,'' Whitaker said. ``He took whatever
pleasure he could find in it. He wasn't afraid to do that. It held
a lot of bad consequences for him, but he did that and that's where
he hurt himself.''
   Where Parker primarily hurt himself was by a heroin addiction
that plagued him for much of his life.
   ``He was trapped and he started very young,'' Whitaker said. ``I
think it has to do with his particular way of life. He was very
sensitive about a lot of things. I think he knew it was destroying
him. He didn't want other people using it.''
   Whitaker, awarded this year's prize for best actor at the Cannes
Film Festival, gives a performance that should get Academy notice.
   He was born in Longview, Texas, and grew up in Los Angeles. He
attended the University of Southern California and originally
studied opera. But he became interested in acting and began
appearing in local equity productions. His involvement with movies
came later.
   ``I was probably going to go to New York and work on stage and
that was it,'' Whitaker said in an interview. ``It just so happens
I was working on a play and it turned into an opportunity to do a
film.''
   Whitaker beat Paul Newman at pool in ``The Color of Money,'' and
played Robin Williams' protege in ``Good Morning, Vietnam.'' He has
been directed by Martin Scorcese, Oliver Stone and Eastwood.
   ``They all have a very keen sense of focus, although their
focuses are different. Some go out in a circle and encompass
everything. Some just focus on this little tiny thing.''
   Whitaker had not even met Eastwood when he was given the part.
   ``I didn't know he had any interest in jazz whatsoever. I didn't
have any preconceived ideas about him. I never expected to see
Dirty Harry walk into that meeting. He turned out to be a real jazz
aficionado and really easy to work for.''
   Whitaker is something of a rarity in Hollywood, a successful
black actor. He had always been aware of the difficulties in
getting good parts, but was not deterred from going into films.
   ``I'm fortunate because I never wanted to do film. I'm real
fortunate that I never really thought about it. That fear wasn't
there because there wasn't a great need at first,'' he said. ``A
lot of the roles I've played have not been written for black
actors.''
   As part of his research for ``Bird,'' Whitaker talked to those
who knew Parker, including the jazzman's wife, Chan. He discovered
that no one really ``knew'' Parker.
   ``It seemed they didn't know what was going on with him. That
helped me immensely to understand where he was coming from,''
Whitaker said.
   ``What did he really say to them? What did they really know
about his fears, how he felt about this? When they told me what
they knew, it was more important what they didn't know. Someone
would say he had no fear and that would tell me how much they
knew.''
   Parker was true to the spirit of his music, spontaneous and
emotional, given to extreme highs and lows. Understandably,
Whitaker was drained by the effort to sustain those feelings.
   ``There are scenes in the latter part of his life when he's
closer to death, when he's lost almost everything. He's walking
around like a lost soul, the only thing that's moving him around is
a little pilot light,'' the actor said.
   ``That was difficult to understand, trying to find that place
where you're still alive but you have nothing left.''
   But how well could anyone really understand Parker? ``Bird has
disentegrated into pure sound,'' a musician once said. Was Parker
beyond words?
   ``He was pushing towards sound,'' Whitaker said. ``The sound was
totally coming from emotion. More than words can express. I think
that was something he felt, understood and put in his music.''
   But Whitaker believes he shares an important philosophical goal
with Parker.
   ``I think he had a quest for understanding, openness. I believe
I have that, trying to figure that stuff out, being open to all
kinds of different things.

<HEAD>Egypt Slows Down When Falcon Crest Is on the Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life comes to a near standstill Monday
nights as millions of Egyptians sit riveted before their television
sets to watch Angela Channing's melodramatic malevolence on
``Falcon Crest.''
   However, Jane Wyman's character and the others in the series
have few counterparts in Egyptian society. Even the setting, a
winery in a Napa Valley-like area of California, might have
alienated many Egyptian Moslems taught by Islam's holy book, the
Koran, to abstain from alcohol.
   Yet the show is a fabulous hit.
   Egypt has nothing similar to the Nielson ratings to gauge
exactly how popular it is, but Sohair el-Etriby, head of Egyptian
Television's second channel, which airs the series, has no doubts.
   ``Egyptians have become addicted to `Falcon Crest,''' she said.
``They've become very attached to it.''
   Whether rich and educated or poor peasants reading Arabic
subtitles on the screen, ``Falcon Crest'' fanatics consider the
characters a part of their extended families. Their fortunes and
disasters are eagerly followed and discussed everywhere.
   The American series also has proved lucrative for state-owned
Egyptian Television. Channel Two buys an episode for around $1,000,
and on a recent Monday sales of commercials brought in almost 20
times that.
   Angela Channing, the scheming matriarch of the Falcon Crest
brood; ruthless but charming Richard Channing; and dedicated and
romantic, if somewhat naive, Maggie are among the main characters
in the colorful series that depicts love, hate and events both foul
and fair.
   Early episodes of ``Falcon Crest'' began appearing on Egyptian
screens several years ago. Because of finances, Egyptian Television
bought only a few 26-episode seasons at a time, showing them daily
and then stopping for months until money was found for succeeding
episodes.
   Despite the gaps in transmission, ``Falcon Crest'' fans remained
true, and for two consecutive months last summer, the fifth and
sixth seasons were aired every night from 9:15 p.m. to 10 p.m.
   The show was so popular that all over Cairo appointments were
made before or after ``Falcon Crest.'' TV parties with friends were
common, and Cairo's congested streets emptied as each episode was
shown.
   At the end of August, el-Etreby changed the schedule, showing
two episodes every Monday night. She said her office immediately
was swamped with hundreds of calls and letters demanding that the
series be shown daily again.
   ``I had only a few episodes from the seventh part, and the
eighth is now running in the United States,'' she said in an
interview. ``Either I could have stopped it for several months and
then shown the seventh part in its entirety, or I could have shown
it once a week like television in America and Europe do all the
time.''
   ``Falcon Crest'' isn't the first American TV series to make a
big splash with Egyptian viewers. In the 1960s and '70s, ``Peyton
Place'' and ``Rich Man, Poor Man'' were favorites.
   In 1982, Egyptian Television began showing ``Dallas,'' which
quickly became almost as popular as ``Falcon Crest'' would become
later. ``Dallas'' was stopped, however, after a member of
parliament complained that it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian
youth.
   The morality of ``Falcon Crest'' would not seem to be much
different, with Angela's scheming against her own son, and the
characters' frequent exchanges of bed partners.
   But the serial has escaped unscathed so far, except for Egyptian
Television's routine censorship which unskillfully scissors about
five minutes of what the censors consider passionate lovemaking
from each 50-minute episode.
   So ``Falcon Crest,'' giving Egyptians a glimpse of a completely
different and glittering world, easily captures its audience.
   Viewers have different reasons for appreciating the series.
   ``I like watching it because the men and women are so beautiful,
wearing lovely clothes and living in beautiful houses,'' said
Fawziya Ahmed, a peasant from a small village north of Cairo in the
Nile Delta.
   Christiane Latif, who helps run a family-owned marble factory,
said: ``The characters are interesting and become like your family,
and the plot makes you want to know what will happen next. I try
not to miss any of the shows.''
   Such sentiments aren't universal, however.
   One government official, who declined to be identified, said he
finds nothing special about Falcon Crest. He complained that his
wife and 5-year-old daughter cannot be distracted from the screen
when the show was on.
   And some Americans worry that Egyptians might think all
Americans are the glittery Hollywood types of ``Falcon Crest.''

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Hispanics May Decide Crucial Texas, California Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outcome of closely fought
presidential races in Texas and California may hinge on whether
George Bush or Michael Dukakis captures the Hispanic vote, but both
candidates seem surprisingly inept in pursuing this fast-growing
electorate.
   Although the Democratic nominee speaks Spanish, the Dukakis
campaign only recently has begun scrambling to deal with what some
observers say is a dangerous lack of local organizing and his
half-hearted, post-primary courting of Hispanics in California.
   ``At this moment it (the Hispanic vote) is in jeopardy,'' said
Ruben Bonilla, director of the Mexican-American Democratic
Political Action Committee. ``There are certain things that need to
be done, and we're in danger of running out of time.''
   At the same time, Bush's own Hispanic initiative hasn't lived up
to his Republican supporters' expectations, and has been weakened
by highly publicized comments by the vice president that some
Hispanic leaders found offensive.
   ``Everyone's angry _ the Latino Democrats and Republicans,''
said Richard Santillan, a professor at California State Polytechnic
University at Pomona.
   ``Both campaigns are doing the same thing _ taking the Hispanic
vote for granted,'' he said.
   At stake in the Hispanic community, ironically, are enough votes
to tip the balance of victory in a close contest.
   In the past 12 years, rapid population growth and massive voter
registration efforts have nearly tripled the number of eligible
Hispanic voters. More than half of all Hispanics live in
California, Texas and New Mexico, which together carry 81 electoral
votes, or 30 percent of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the
presidency.
   Pollsters say the presidential races in California and perhaps
in Texas may come down to margins of about 100,000 votes either
way. Hispanic groups have registered 100,000 new voters in
California and 70,000 in Texas this year.
   Hispanics already are credited with providing victory margins
for Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., in 1986, and for Dukakis on the
``Super Tuesday'' primary in Texas.
   But to provide the margin of victory over Bush, who leads in
most polls, analysts say Dukakis would have to win upwards of 75
percent of a large Hispanic turnout. Bush is seeking at least
one-third of the vote or else a low turnout.
   Hispanics traditionally have low turnout rates in presidential
elections. Excitement about Dukakis and the prospect of helping to
decide a close race led experts to predict record numbers of
Hispanics casting ballots on Nov. 8.
   Those predictions may now be in doubt. In poorer Hispanic
neighborhoods, which usually are Democratic strongholds, the key to
winning is effective door-to-door campaigning, high-profile rallies
and workable get-out-the-vote machinery. There also must be a close
race, where Hispanics believe their votes can make a difference.
   ``The burden really is on Dukakis to convince people, and for
his machine to get people to come out and vote,'' said Cal Tech's
Santillan, an expert on voting trends and ethnic studies. ``I don't
know if he's been able to do that.''
   Said Richard Martinez, California director of the non-partisan
Southwest Voter Registration Education Project:
   ``The longer they wait, the more options they cut off. The key
for the Democrats is, are you going to be smart enough to make the
investment and get out that 75 percent you need? Are you going to
play your Hispanic card?''
   Bush has tried to corral Hispanic voters by stressing his stands
for a strong military and against abortion and crime, and pointing
to the Reagan administration's new Hispanic education secretary,
Lauro Cavazos.
   The vice president is targeting middle-class neighborhoods which
are more likely to vote Republican.
   Bush's efforts have been hampered by several incidents that many
Hispanics regard as mistakes. One was when he referred to his
Hispanic grandchildren as ``the little brown ones.''
   Another was when he told students at an East Los Angeles high
school renowned for its high rate of college-bound graduates that
``you don't have to go to college to be a success. We need those
people who build our buildings, who send them soaring into the
sky.''
   Dukakis hasn't campaigned in the Hispanic stronghold of South
Texas since July. Bonilla and other South Texas leaders complain
they don't have access to the Massachusetts governor's top
advisers, who don't understand the Hispanic community even though
``they cast their whole fortunes in Texas with the Hispanic
community.''
   In California, campaigning was so laggardly that a group of
local elected officials who support Dukakis demanded a meeting with
his state campaign officials to plead for action. Result: an
immediate bolstering of the campaign staff in the primary Hispanic
battleground in East Los Angeles.
   ``We stepped in and said if you're committed to more than a
symbolic Hispanic campaign, then you should have in place a strong
get-out-the-vote effort,'' said Los Angeles City Councilwoman
Gloria Molina.
   ``In other areas, I think it may only be a superficial
campaign,'' she said. ``In our area, we stepped in. There's still
time for the Dukakis campaign to put that network in place.''
   Dukakis met privately with about two dozen Texas Hispanic
leaders during a late September trip to Dallas. Four days later,
Bonilla was contacted to tape Hispanic radio ads for the Democratic
nominee.
   Richard Ybarra, chief of Hispanic strategy for the Dukakis
campaign, said he is counting on local leaders to energize their
communities because Dukakis cannot appear everywhere at once.
   ``He has to go to places targeted for improvement,'' Ybarra
said. ``It's up to us to get our job done. We'll be spending more
advertising money in the Hispanic community than our party has ever
before, and it will be more effective than ever before.''
   Some prominent Hispanic leaders, like Mayor Henry Cisneros of
San Antonio, Texas, are campaigning hard as Dukakis surrogates.
   ``I see a lot of excitement,'' the mayor said. ``People have
been out of power long enough now, and they sense that this
election makes a difference.''
   Door-to-door voter registration and leafleting is more intense
than ever in some communities, notably San Antonio.
   Dukakis aides say running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a native of
South Texas who is popular among Hispanics, gives the campaign a
logistical and emotional boost in Texas.
   Observers say some of the complaints may stem from Dukakis'
showing in public opinion polls which place him as much as 10
percentage points behind Bush in Texas, the vice president's
adopted home state, and slightly behind in California.
   Whoever wins, and whatever role Hispanics play, local organizers
say the campaign has been good for Hispanics' emergence as a
political power.
   The Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project will have
its most productive voter registration drive in any presidential
election year since it was founded in 1974, said director Andy
Hernandez.
   ``I think the fact that so much attention has been paid to the
Hispanic vote has tended to create more momentum,'' Hernandez said.
   ``I think it is watershed election for us. From now on, no one
can think about winning the presidency or the governorship without
Hispanics being a critical element in there,'' he said.
   ``The fact is, we are now part of the equation. Even before the
election takes place, we've already arrived.''

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
failed to investigate most reports of suspicious foreign trading of
U.S. securities, despite a growing number of illegal trades
originating from abroad, a House panel says.
   A report released Monday by the Government Operations Committee
stated the SEC actively had investigated only 61 of 229 reports
from stock exchanges of suspicious foreign trades _ mostly those
appearing to involve insider trading _ in 1986 and 1987.
   The report was based on a year-long investigation by the panel's

   The stock market crash has realigned the
fortunes of the nation's wealthiest, but they are still really rich.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey found the 400 wealthiest
Americans had total worth of about $220 billion at midyear, enough
to wipe out the government's budget deficit or nearly enough to
support the entire U.S. military, which spent $287 billion in 1987.
   The average fortune on the list comes to $551 million, up $1
million from last year.

   The legion of American billionaires has
broadened to include 51 people, despite the 1987 stock market crash
that realigned the fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled $84.8 billion _ nearly $5 billion more
than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The other 349 people who constitute Forbes' list of the 400
richest Americans were worth about $135.2 billion.The average
fortune is $551 million, up $1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by $2 billion following the crash.
   Walton, head of the Arkansas-based Wal-Mart discount store
empire, scoffs at his $6.7 billion fortune. He calls it ``just
paper _ all I own is a pickup truck and a little Wal-Mart stock.''
   Forbes said Walton is the world's fifth-richest person after
Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, worth $18.9 billion; Taikichiro Mori,
$18 billion; and Haruhiko Yoshimoto, $7.8 billion; and Canada's
Kenneth Cole Irving, $8 billion.
   But last year's Oct. 19 financial market crash slashed fortunes
and caused 22 former members to be dropped from the list because
their fortunes slipped below Forbes' $225 million cutoff.
   The list appears in the Oct. 24 edition of Forbes and is based
on holdings as of Aug. 30.
   Runner-up to Walton on the U.S. billionaire list is John Werner
Kluge, the German-born head of Metromedia Co., with a net worth of
$3.2 billion. Kluge was followed by H. Ross Perot, founder of
Electronic Data Systems, with $3 billion; publishers Samuel I.
Newhouse Jr. and Donald Newhouse, $2.6 billion each; and Pittsburgh
industrialist Henry Lea Hillman, $2.5 billion.
   Underscoring the adage that the more you have, the more you can
lose, billionaires were among those hit hard by the crash.Among the
big losers were David Packard, founder of Hewlett-Packard, media
magnate Keith Rupert Murdoch and retailer Leslie Wexner, each of
whom lost up to 50 percent of their fortunes.
   Among those new to the billionaire club are flamboyant New York
real estate developer Donald Trump, who claims a net worth of $3.47
billion, though Forbes' estimate is in the $1 billion range.
   Joining Trump as list rookies are: Sumner Murray Redstone, who
boosted his balance sheet with the takeover of Viacom, $1.4
billion; press-shy Charles Feeney, who runs Duty-Free Shoppers at
airports, $1.3 billion; Charles Sammons, head of the privately held
Sammons Enterprises, the nation's 15th largest cable TV operator,
$1.3 billion; Charles de Ganahl Koch and David Hamilton Koch,
brothers involved in oil services, $1.1 billion each, and Ronald O.
Perelman, takeover strategist and head of Revlon, $1 billion.
   Four businessmen returned to the ranks of multimillionaire when
their fortunes sank below $1 billion: Laurence and Robert Tisch of
Loews Corp., each estimated at $850 million; Milton Petrie, the
philanthropist and head of Petrie Stores, $750 million; and
financier Carl Lindner II, $950 million.
   William Henry Gates III, who dropped out of Harvard and founded
the Microsoft software company, remained the youngest self-made
billionaire at age 32. His net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion.
   The oldest person new to the list is Mansfield Freeman, who
holds a stake in American International Group. With a fortune of
$240 million, he made the list for the first time at age 93.
   Among the 52 who disappeared from the list, 22 vanished because
of Black Monday-associated losses, 26 were surpassed by greater
fortunes and four died. Other Forbes standbys include: real estate
tycoon Harry Helmsley, $1.7 billion; takeover strategist Carl
Icahn, $940 million; brewer August Busch Jr., $1.1 billion;
designer Ralph Lauren, $450 million; cosmetics queen Estee Lauder,
$450 million; and vintners Ernest and Julio Gallo, $350 million
each.

   In a throwback to the days of the landed gentry,
real estate has become the No. 1 source of wealth for members of
the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans.
   Eighty-seven of the Forbes 400 made their fortunes principally
from real estate, up from 73 last year, Forbes says.
   Following real estate, manufacturing accounted for 75 of the

<HEAD>Manufacturers Say They Expect Increased Demand In 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drought may have slowed a long-awaited
rebound in farm equipment sales, but manufacturers say they believe
demand will rise in 1989, as farmers are expected to significantly
step up planting.
   The size and condition of an aging fleet of farm equipment may
not be adequate to handle 25 million or more additional acres of
crops anticipated next spring, said John Tye, president of the Tye
Co. and newly elected chairman of the Farm and Industrial Equipment
Institute.
   ``This factor, combined with the fact that many farmers who will
be handling the increased production are more secure financially
than a year ago, should stimulate demand,'' Tye said.
   Tye said the government has agreed to allow farmers to
substantially increase 1989 plantings without jeopardizing their
federal subsidies. He said such increased activity would come at a
time industry inventories are at the lowest levels in years, and
the fleet of machines in use has the highest average age in two
decades.
   The comments came in assessments released at the annual
convention of the equipment manufacturers which ends today in Boca
Raton, Fla., and distributed by the Chicago-based group.
   Hans W. Becherer, president of Deere & Co., said he believes
farmers deferred purchases this year and are awaiting signs
there'll be no repeat of this summer's drought.
   He noted record levels of farm income in 1987 and 1988 and said
that should boost sales in 1989.
   ``Farmers, overall, are in a better financial situation than
they have been for many years. The need for new equipment is there,
if the weather cooperates, 1989 could be a very good year,'' said
Bernard L. Nielsen, president of the Gehl Co.
   The drought hit the farm equipment industry just as it was
making headway in a recovery from a severe slump.
   After seven years of decline, spending on farm machinery rose to
$5.77 billion in 1987 from $4.61 billion in 1986, according to the
Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
That still was below the record of nearly $12 billion in sales in
1979.
   The USDA is forecasting 1988 sales may range from $5.7 billion
to $6.2 billion, spurred by a sales boom early in the year before
the drought shriveled crops in the field.
   ``In spite of the drought, the combination of high commodity
prices and government drought payments mean the farmer will have
significant net farm income available with which to purchase,''
said John Annin, vice president of operations for Farmhand Inc.
   James K. Askford, president of Case IH, predicted sales of
two-wheel-drive tractors over 130 horsepower would rise from 15
percent to 20 percent as drought-delayed purchases are made in
1989. He also said his company expects sales of combines,
implements, hay and forage equipment will increase.
   ``We feel very positive about the agricultural outlook in
1989,'' said William Templeton, vice president for marketing at
Deutz-Allis Corp. ``We see very strong sales gains in large
two-wheeled-drive farm tractors and self-propelled combines along
with significant gains in tillage and hay tools.''
   Robert F. Moglia, chairman of Ford New Holland Inc., said,
``More favorable weather this fall and winter should help industry
sales resume pre-drought recovery for tractors over 40 horsepower
and related equipment.''
   He predicted the heaviest buying activity would occur early next
year, with sales continuing at a more moderate rate for the rest of
1989.
   Richard Anderson, general manager of the agriculture products
group of Behlen Manufacturing Co., said he feels there is only
limited demand for grain storage and handling equipment.
   ``Lower than expected yields and greater exports of grain in
1988 will definitely have a negative effect on the grain storage
market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Controller Warns Banks About Merger of FDIC, FSLIC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top federal regulator says the banking
industry should to take a more active role in dealing with the
growing savings and loan crisis, because if they don't Congress
might unilaterally take unpopular action to do so.
   ``The banking community must by necessity be involved in shaping
the resolution of the...crisis,'' Comptroller of the Currency
Robert L. Clarke told a gathering of bankers Monday at the 114th
annual convention of the American Bankers Association here.
   ``My mission is to challenge you to think...in broad terms to
avoid placing banking in the position of being a prisoner of
events.''
   About a quarter of the 3,200 federally insured S&Ls are
considered insovlent or close to it, with most of the problem
thrifts concentrated in the energy and farm belts. Those S&Ls
accounted for a large portion of the $3.6 billion in overall losses
by thrifts in the second quarter.
   Estimates for the cost of liquidating or bailing out the
troubled thrifts have ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion. Some
experts say the taxpayers may have to pick up at least some of the
tab.
   Clarke said it was inevitable that Congress and the next
president would consider merging the healthy Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which insures most of the 14,000 commercial banks
and a few thrifts, with the weaker Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., the main S&L insurer.
   If that occurred, Clarke said, ``it is conceivable that a merger
of the FDIC and FSLIC funds could lead to a merger of all the
depository institution regulatory authorities.''
   The FDIC and FSLIC both insure deposits of individuals for up to
$100,000. But while the FSLIC posted a $13.7 billion deficit last
year, the FDIC had $18 billion in reserves and expects to have
funds totaling $15 billion by year's end.
   ``Merging the FDIC insurance fund with the thrift insurance fund
has a political attractiveness,'' said Clarke, whose agencies
regulates nationally chartered banks. ``Certainly there isn't
enough money in the FDIC fund to solve the problem, but the fund is
enough to serve as a significant downpayment, and it is available.''
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman and the ABA long have opposed
merging the two insurance funds.
   For one thing, bankers fear a merger would drive up the cost of
their their insurance premiums, which are about 2{ percentage
points below what thrifts pay.
   Bankers also worry that tapping into the FDIC may aggravate the
banks' own failure problem. The FDIC says a record number of banks
will fail this year _ as many as 250 _ compared with a record 184
banks that closed last year and 19 others that needed federal
assistance.
   Clarke says he also is against an FDIC-FSLIC merger, but ``if
the banking industry refuses to acknowledcge even the mere
possibility of using FDIC funds as part of a solution to the thrift
crisis, it is walking away from the table.''
   At a news conference Monday, the ABA's newly elected president,
Thomas Rideout, said the thrift crisis was a top priority of the
trade group, along with banking-reform legislation.
   The ABA released a report last month calling for insolvent
thrifts to be liquidated at a faster pace. It also criticized the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, for failing
to provide proper supervision of S&Ls.

   Tenneco Inc. has traveled further in its exodus

sell its oil and gas operations for an amount expected to exceed
$7.3 billion.
   Although negotiations continued for some minor operations, the
nation's 10th largest oil company said Monday it had entered into
definitive contracts with several buyers.
   At least 10 companies said Monday they had agreed to buy part of
Tenneco. The company planned to release more information today
following a board meeting.
   The Houston-based company announced in May its plans to sell
Tenneco Oil Co. _ which accounts for about 22 percent of total
revenue _ and use the proceeds to help pay its hefty $8.5 billion
debt.
   Analysts earlier had predicted the sale would fetch between $5
billion and $7 billion.
   After the sale, company officials said, Tenneco's businesses
would be composed of 31 percent farm and construction equipment; 23
percent pipeline; 14 percent shipbuilding; 13 percent auto parts;
10 percent packaging; and 9 percent chemical.
   Chevron Corp. said it agreed to buy Tenneco's Gulf of Mexico oil
and natural gas reserves, production facilities and leasehold
interests for nearly $2.6 billion. The San Francisco-based Chevron
said the transaction requires federal approval.
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership agreed
to buy the mid-continent division oil and gas subsidiary for $715
million.
   Fina Oil and Chemical Co., American Petrofina's principal
operating subsidiary, agreed to buy Tenneco's Gulf
Coast-Southwestern exploration and production business in a stock
purchase plan valued at a little more than $600 million.
   Houston-based Seagull Energy Corp. signed letters of intent to
buy the outstanding capital stock of Houston Oil & Minerals Corp.,
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenneco, for $16.4 million.
   Others buying part of the Tenneco divisions are New York-based
Mobil Corp., Los Angeles-based Arco, Chicago-based Amoco Corp., and
Conoco Norway Inc., a subsidiary of Houston-based Conoco Inc.
   Mobil announced Monday it signed a definitive agreement to buy
Tenneco's Chalmette, La., refinery and related facilities for $560
million and an adjustment for working capital.
   Arco is buying Tenneco's California operations for $670 million
to $700 million while Amoco's production company unit agreed to buy
Tenneco Oil Co.'s Rocky Mountain division for $900 million.
   Also Monday, a subsidiary of Houston-based Conoco Inc. announced
Monday it has agreed to purchase the Norwegian affiliate of Tenneco
for $115 million.
   The agreement provides for Conoco Norway Inc. to buy 100 percent
of Tenneco Oil Norway A@S shares, subject to the approval of the
Norwegian government. Tenneco Norway has about 125 million barrels
of oil equivalent reserves awaiting development.
   For the second quarter of 1988, Tenneco posted net income of
$154 million. The earnings included a one-time gain of $23 million
related to the sale of a European shipping and storage company and
a New Jersey heating oil retailing company.
   Total sales and operations revenue for the quarter were $3.9
billion. Operating income for the quarter was $322 million,
excluding operating income of $147 million for Tenneco Oil Co.

<HEAD>New President Named For Coca-Cola USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ira C. Herbert has been named president of
Coca-Cola USA, the flagship division of Coca-Cola Co., as part of
what the company calls a strategy to increase its advertising
firepower in the cola wars.
   ``We are convinced that the key factor to success in the decade
ahead will be the ability to serve, excite and communicate with the
consumer in cooperation with our bottlers and the retail trade,''
said Donald R. Keough, president of The Coca-Cola Co.
   He called Herbert ``our most experienced and senior marketing
executive.''
   PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola's chief rival in the soft drink market,
has staged splashy advertising campaigns this year linked to the
America's Cup race and heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson, while
Coca-Cola's advertising has been more conventional.
   Emanuel Goldman, a beverage industry analyst for PaineWebber in
San Francisco, said Coca-Cola has not necessarily been upstaged by
the Pepsi campaigns, but he said Herbert's appointment may indicate
a concern about marketing among the company's top management.
   ``You can't really be sure, but I would say the fact that it's
Ike Herbert and not somebody else says something,'' Goldman said.
   Herbert, the executive vice president of the parent company,
will replace Edwin R. Mellett as president of both Coca-Cola USA
and the company's North America Business Sector.
   Mellett, a senior vice president of Coca-Cola Co., will take
over the new job of president of international post-mix sales,
where he will be in charge of fountain sales outside the United
States.
   Herbert worked for the McCann-Erickson advertising agency before
joining Coca-Cola in 1965. He later was vice president of marketing
for Coca-Cola USA and president and chief executive officer of
Coca-Cola Foods. He became chief operating officer of the parent
company in 1982.

<HEAD>Griffin Says He Won't Offer Assurances About Closing Deal On
Resorts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Donald Trump and
Resorts International Inc., as well as state casino regulators, say
they are puzzled by an apparent shift in entertainer Merv Griffin's
plans to purchase the hotel-casino business for $364 million.
   A lawyer for Griffin said Monday he could offer no assurances
that the deal, which only recently seemed on the verge of
completion, would go forward.
   Griffin was to appear today before the state Casino Control
Commission to discuss the matter.
   ``There are a lot of questions,'' said Joel Sterns, an attorney
for Resorts. ``...I frankly don't know what this means.''
   Griffin issued a prepared statement Monday saying he allowed a
deadline to complete the acquisition to expire on Friday, and that
any party to the proposed deal was free to terminate its
obligations.
   The former talk-show host had offered to pay $36 a share for the
Class A stock of Resorts, which owns a casino and real estate in
Atlantic City, plus land and a casino in the Bahamas.
   Resorts Class A stock closed down $4.87{ a share at $29.12{
Monday on the American Stock Exchange, and traded as low as $26 a
share during the session.
   Griffin, who recently has turned his attention to real estate,
would take Resorts private by also buying out real estate magnate
Trump's controlling Class B stock for $135 a share, and pay Trump
$63 million to break his management contract with Resorts. Griffin
also planned to
   Griffin's latest move could be an indication that he believes he
can buy Resorts at a lower price by threatening to withdraw from
the deal.
   A spokesman for Griffin Co., Thomas Gallagher, said: ``We have
not made any decision that we're going to terminate. On the other
hand, we're not giving any assurance that the deal is going to go
forward.''
   A lawyer for Trump was more optimistic.
   ``The deal is going to go forward,'' said Jack Nusbaum from his
New York office. He said Griffin ``has given us no indication he's
going to back out of the deal.''
   Griffin said in the news release that if an acquisition was
completed it would be done through a merger, not a tender offer. A
merger offer was approved Aug. 30 by the required number of
shareholders, said Griffin.
   Griffin and Trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control
of Resorts, but appeared to have come to terms about their
differences and worked out the deal now in question.
   In addition to the money Griffin would pay for Resorts stock, he
would invest $50 million in Resorts to help it generate enough cash
flow to cover interest payments on Resorts' debt.
   In turn, Trump would pay Resorts $273 million for its
unfinished, 1,250-room Taj Mahal Casino.

   The dollar traded lower in Europe today, pulled
down by an earlier drop against the Japanese yen in Asia, foreign
currency traders said.
   Gold prices firmed.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 131.15 yen, down 2.35 yen, largely due to
technical selling, traders said. The dollar was trading at the same
level later in London.
   In Rome, traders said the dollar was also under pressure in
anticipation of Thursday's U.S. trade report for August which is
expected to show a worsening trade deficit.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.8507 West German marks, down from 1.8550;
1.5700 Swiss francs, down from 1.5755; 6.3060 French francs, down
from 6.3213; 2.0859 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0907; 1.379.00
Italian lire, down from 1,383.295; and 1.2070 Canadian dollars,
unchanged.
   The British pound continued to strengthen. One pound cost
$1.7195 this morning, compared with $1.7130 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409.85 an ounce, up
from $407.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $408.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $407.10, up from $407 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.79 to close at a bid $412.13.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.35 an ounce,
slightly lower than Monday's $6.37.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today
while prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar fell sharply and closed at 131.15 yen, down 2.35 yen
from Friday's close of 133.50 yen. After opening at 132.20 yen, the
currency gradually fell while ranging between 130.95 yen and 132.23
yen.
   It was the first time the dollar closed at the 131-yen level
since July 25, when it closed at 131.80 yen.
   A dealer with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the the pound sterling rose sharply against the
dollar overnight in London and the Tokyo market followed suit.
   The dollar's decline in London was widely linked to a statement
Monday by Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, who
said the government would keep interest rates high ``as long as it
is necessary to fight inflation.''
   The Mitsubishi dealer said dollar-selling dominated today's
trading in Tokyo, led by speculative investors.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 211.33 points, or 0.78
percent, to finish trading at 27,469.60. The market's main index
quickly gained 278.98 points after the trading began and kept
rising, although at a slower pace.
   ``Trading started off pretty good following the (Dow Jones')
higher close in New York overnight,'' said a broker with Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Although share prices were higher across the board in the
early trading, the index was unable to keep rising due to lack of
the market's energy,'' he said.
   ``But a good thing was that participants traded a variety of
issues,'' although trading was light with the volume on the first
section estimated at 650 million shares, the broker said.
   Among issues that attracted participants were steels, cars and
chemicals.

   Stock prices fell Tuesday, with trading light
ahead of the release later this week of key economic reports and
Britain's Conservative Party convention.
   Stocks of companies whose earnings are dollar-dominated were
among the major losers, dropping back in line with the U.S.
currency's weakness on foreign exchange markets.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 5.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,839 at midday.
   Volume was light, as 244.8 million shares changed hands,
compared with 236.9 million shares at the same time Monday.
   Key among the economic statistics due out this week will be
Thursday's release of U.S. trade figures for August. British retail
price figures will be announced Friday.
   In addition, the market will be keenly watching the Conservative
Party convention for indications about the near-term course of
British interest rates. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson

<TEXT>
   ``Fill 'er up'' may take on a whole new meaning
if a partnership between Amoco Corp. and Dunkin Donuts Inc. catches
on around the country.
   The two companies have merged a self-service gas station in
Downers Grove, Ill., a Chicago suburb, with a doughnut shop under
the same roof and say the results have been promising.
   ``We don't have an awful lot of experience,'' said Richard Hart,
vice president and treasurer of the Randolph, Mass.-based Dunkin'
Donuts. ``But the results are satisfactory enough that we're
looking at other locations with Amoco.''
   The partnership is a departure from having convenience stores
adjacent to gas pumps and having service stations and fast food
restaurants share sites on highways or near toll booths.
   At the moment, Chicago-based Amoco stands alone in putting gas
stations and fast-food stores under one roof.
   ``This may be a trend we're looking at,'' said Joseph Koach,
executive director of the Service Station Dealers of America.
   For Amoco, the deal with Dunkin' Donuts is one of a number of
agreements with various fast food firms, including Burger King
Corp. and International Dairy Queen, Inc.
   ``The thinking is that their (Amoco) customers and our customers
are looking for the same thing: convenience, good products and good
prices,'' said Colt Hothorn, national director of development for
Burger King.
   ``There are compatible needs on the part of the customer. It's
not difficult to see a person filling up and buying a doughnut, or
a hamburger or an ice cream cone,'' said Robert Rauscher, Amoco's
vice president for marketing.
   Amoco and Dunkin' Donuts started the Downers Grove project in
1986 and since then, the oil company has started similar joint
ventures with Burger King in Pillsbury, Colo. and Dairy Queen in
Westminster, Colo.
   Two more partnerships, with Joyce's Subs and Pizza, a
Denver-based chain, are scheduled to start this fall in Colorado.
   In all cases, the food stores will sell only take-out items and
the gas stations are all self-service.
   The concept has attracted customers' notice.
   ``I come in all the time,'' said Keri Moon, a college student
who uses the Downers Grove station. ``It's a quick way to get
breakfast.'' If she could not buy doughnuts there, she said, ``I'd
probably buy gas someplace else.''
   ``There are a lot of stations down the street selling gas for
the same price, so it's not the price,'' said Alan Buresz, of
Lemont, another Chicago suburb, who is a frequent customer. ``I
come in for the convenience.''
   Other firms, such as Texaco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. have
built gas stations in tandem with McDonald's restaurants along
highways and each is looking to add more.
   But unlike Amoco's project, McDonald's likes to place sit-down
restaurants next to gas stations and have the two businesses
operate separately.
   ``McDonald's is in the business of selling hamburgers. We want
to leave selling gasoline to the oil companies,'' said Melissa
Oakley, a spokeswoman for the fast food giant.
   But Rauscher said other oil companies will follow Amoco's lead.
``It's too soon to say that this is the next thing,'' he said.
``But if successful, these things tend to be duplicated.''

   The stock market opened lower today, after
pushing a key index to its highest level since last October's crash
in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 8.71 points
to a post-crash high on Monday, was off 3.55 at 2,155.41 after 30
minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of more than 2 to

646 down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.02 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street, compared with 16.68 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Investors have taken some reassurance from recent government
reports that the economy is growing at a more moderate pace than
earlier this year.
   Slower growth has been taken to indicate that inflation is not
an immediate problem and that the Federal Reserve will find no
compelling need to tighten credit conditions.
   The bond market was lower today after taking Monday off for the
observance of Columbus Day. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were
up to 8.85 percent.
   Among the active issues in the early going on the NYSE, Tenneco
was up ] at 50[, Pillsbury was down [ at 57\ and Archer Daniels
Midland was down [ at 20{.
   International Business Machines was up { at 116| in the early
going.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

market index was up 0.11 at 304.20.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 8.71 to
2,158.96, surpassing the previous post-crash closing peak of
2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with

<HEAD>KKR Withdraws Bid For Kroger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
today withdrew its $5.03 billion offer to acquire Kroger Co.,
saying it was disappointed the supermarket chain had rejected the
proposal.
   In a letter to Cincinnati-based Kroger, Kohlberg said, ``We find
it difficult to understand that the board acted on matters of such
importance to stockholders without the benefit of meeting with us
... We can only conclude that the board has decided the company is
not for sale at any price. ''
   Kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals.
   A week ago, New York-based Kohlberg sweetened its bid for the
nation's second-largest supermarket operator to $64 a share in cash
and securities. The bid was competing against a $55-a-share offer
from Maryland's Haft family, which began the contest last month.
   Although analysts said Kroger managers might be pressured to
accept Kohlberg's latest offer, the grocer last week began laying
off employees as part of a restructuring plan designed to fend off
the two unwanted suitors.
   Some 300 positions were eliminated at Kroger headquarters, and
the company also has announced plans to sell off certain assets.
   As part of its restructuring, Kroger plans to distribute a
special dividend of $40 in cash plus notes and stock for each
Kroger share. In its letter to the board, Kohlberg said the
financial community had valued the Kroger restructuring at $53 to
$56 a share.
   On Wall Street, trading in Kroger shares was halted temporarily.
The last sale of Kroger stock was at $57.50 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 12{ cents from Monday.
   The buyout firm hinted it might have been willing to improve its
offer if it had an opportunity to meet with the board.
   ``We are perplexed that the board found our proposal to be
inadequate,'' the letter said, adding that Kohlberg was not even
asked ``if we were in a position to improve'' the bid.
   The Haft family, which controls Dart Group Corp. and has a
reputation as corporate raiders, last week offered to help Kroger
fight the Kohlberg bid by proposing to provide additional equity
for Kroger's restructuring.
   The 105-year-old Kroger has 170,000 employees and 52,000
shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets
and convenience stores.

   Digital Equipment Corp., which has seen
the value of its stock drop, effectively raised its prices by 6
percent to 9 percent on most products by eliminating a free,
one-year warranty program, a move expected to help on Wall Street.
   The move, announced late Monday, topped the 3 percent to 5
percent increase announced earlier by International Business
Machines Corp., which analysts had predicted Digital would match.
   Digital, which fell $1.37{ to $88.12{ on Monday, was up $1 at
$89.12{ in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
   John Buckley, a Digital spokesman, said customers would be
advised to purchase a ``standard warranty,'' which adds about 6
percent to 9 percent to equipment costs. Free service would still
be available to customers who bring their computers to Digital
facilities for repair, he said.
   The warranty changes took effect immediately in the U.S. and
were to be expanded internationally next year.
   Digital also announced it would increase by 2 percent the price
of add-on hardware and software products purchased separately from
the computer system.

   Investors have taken some reassurance from recent government
reports that the economy is growing at a more moderate pace than
earlier this year.
   Slower growth has been taken to indicate that inflation is not
an immediate problem and that the Federal Reserve will find no
compelling need to tighten credit conditions.
   Tighter credit means higher interest rates, and makes
fixed-income securities such as Treasury notes and bonds more
competitive with stocks.
   The bond market was lower today after taking Monday off for the
observance of Columbus Day. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were
up to 8.86 percent.
   But investors are worried that the earnings reports due to be
released over the next three weeks may show smaller gains than
earlier this year.
   And some analysts contend that some traders remain wary of
stocks as the market pushes toward levels from which it crashed
only a year ago next week.

   Soybean futures prices were narrowly mixed while
grain futures were mostly lower in cautious early trading today on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said traders were taking few chances ahead of the
Agriculture Department's revised crop production report, due
Wednesday afternoon.
   The market has developed ``a little bit of a bearish bias'' on
expectations that the USDA will increase its corn and soybean
production estimates due to better-than-expected yields in the
ongoing harvest, said Ted Mao, a grain specialist with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   But analysts' published pre-report guesses vary widely _ from
1.44 billion to 1.54 billion bushels of soybeans, and from 4.25
billion to 4.6 billion bushels of corn.
   Those numbers compare with the USDA's September estimates of
1.47 billion bushels of soybeans and 4.46 billion bushels of corn.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $2.92{ a bushel; oats
for December delivery, the only active contract in early trading,
were \ cent lower at $2.46} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower
to 5 cents higher with November at $7.90{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .40 cent lower with October at
72.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .37 cent lower
with October at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .32 cent
lower with October at 40.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.28 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 47.37 cents a
pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower on Monday while pork bellies
settled higher.

   The stock market retreated broadly today, as
profit-taking depressed prices a day after one key market index
reached its highest level since last October's crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 8.71 points
to a post-crash high on Monday, was down 12.27 at 2,146.69 at
noontime.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 2 to 1 among

   The bond market was lower today after taking Monday off for the

   Analysts said today's decline reflected some profit-taking after
four consecutive advances by the Dow Jones industrial average,
including a 42.50-point rise last Friday.
   ``When the rally didn't continue through today, some traders
thought they would take a few profits,'' said Eldon A. Grimm,
senior vice president at Birr, Wilson Securities.
   He said an overnight decline in the dollar in foreign exchange
trading may also have discouraged stock investors, particularly
foreigners.
   Some traders also remain wary of stocks as the market pushes

   The United Auto Workers told negotiators
for Caterpillar Inc. today the company has five more days to reach
agreement on a new contract or face the possibility of a strike.
   Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin said the contract would expire
at 9:30 a.m. Sunday.
   No new talks between the company and Caterpillar have been
scheduled, Polzin said.
   Talks between the UAW and Caterpillar recessed Sept. 30, the day
the current contract was to have expired, with both sides agreeing
to an indefinite extension that could be lifted any time, as long
as notice of five days was given.
   When the two sides met briefly this morning, the union gave such
notice to the company.
   Polzin declined to discuss the situation further. Union
officials were not immediately available for comment today, but
chief UAW negotiator Bill Casstevens said the union wanted to get
down to serious talks immediately.
   Negotiators could keep talking right through the deadline in an
effort to reach an agreement, they could extend the deadline or the
union could call a strike.
   The union's membership has voted to authorize a strike.
   Union officials had said Monday they believed a new deadline
would prompt the two sides to negotiate at a quick pace, picking up
where they left off before the extension. Without such a deadline,
they said, there would be less incentive for either side to make
rapid progress.
   The union sought the extension so it could concentrate on
reaching a new agreement with Deere & Co. UAW members ratified an
agreement with Deere over the weekend.

<HEAD>Takeover Target Interco Reports Lower Quarterly Net</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., fighting a $2.5 billion hostile
tender offer, on Tuesday said its profits slipped 9 percent in the
second fiscal quarter.
   The company said net income totaled $34.9 million, or 93 cents a
share in the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with $38.4 million, or
90 cents a share in the year-ago period.
   Sales during the quarter totaled $630 million, up 3 percent from
$610 million in the comparable period in 1987.
   Results were restated to reflect Interco's announcement in
August to put its apparel manufacturing group up for sale.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by the Rales brothers of
Washington, D.C., has launched a $70-a-share tender offer for
Interco that is being contested in the courts.
   For the first half of the fiscal year, Interco said earnings
totaled $65.6 million, or $1.73 per share, up 1 percent from $64.9
million, or $1.52 per share a year earlier.
   The number of shares outstanding totaled 37.83 million at the
end of the first fiscal half, down from 42.80 million a year ago.
   Sales were up 3 percent at $1.27 billion, from $1.23 billion in
the first half of the pervious fiscal year.
   Interco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Harvey Saligman
noted in a statement that ``despite the distraction during recent
months caused by the unsolicited hostile tender offer, sales and
earnings per share were ahead of last year's strong performance.''
   In response to Cardinal's tender offer, Interco announced a
major restructuring and recapitalization program last month that is
designed to increase shareholder value to at least $76 a share.
   Interco, a manufacturer of furniture and apparel, is
headquartered in St. Louis.

   Oil futures are bounding up from two-year lows
reached last week, but analysts say it is unclear whether the
recent downward trend in prices has been reversed or merely
interrupted.
   Trading was active Monday, analysts said, as Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest oil exporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its
production quota if other members of OPEC did.
   The statement triggered speculation that other members of the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would
reduce production in order to help boost prices.
   But Nauman Barakat, vice president for energy investment at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he remained skeptical
because other OPEC members have ``shown no indication they are
willing to cut back output.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate climbed 66 cents to settle at $13.60 a
barrel. At one point during the day's trading, the contract traded
as high as $13.80 a barrel.
   After opening lower today, prices retraced lost ground. By
midday, the November crude contract was up 6 cents at $13.66 a
barrel.
   Crude oil prices had tumbled to around $12.30 a barrel last week
as Saudi Arabia threatened to produce more than its quota if the
other OPEC members continued pumping more than their quotas.
   Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, the November
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.28 cent to settle
at 41.41 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 1.50 cents to
38.96 cents a gallon.
   Steven Chronowitz, director of futures research at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. Inc., said Monday's rise could mean prices
bottomed out last week.
   But he said, ``if over the next few weeks we don't see any real
action to back up the words, then the market may sag again.''
   Saudi Arabia delivered its affirmation about its willingness to
abide by its quota if others did at the weekly Cabinet session
presided over by King Fahd and reported by Information Minister Ali
al-Shaer.
   Prudential-Bache's Barakat said the Saudis have made similar
statements before, but that ``this statement is being taken more
seriously than before.''
   He said one explanation is that a published report from the
Mideast said Saudi Arabia produced an average of 4.3 million
barrels a day in the first week of October, matching its quota. He
said previously, the Saudis reportedly had been producing 5.7
million barrels a day.
   Barakat said the market was asking ``whether they have cut back
output intentionally as an overture to others to cut back output or
is it result of scheduling problems. That is the $64,000 question.''
   He said trading was heavy and was driven by professionals buying
contracts to cover borrowed contracts they sold earlier on the
expectation that prices would fall further.
   ``The rally was a combination of technicals and fundamentals.
People are still not giving too much credence to the Saudi
statement,'' he said.

<HEAD>United Telecom Reports Profit As US Sprint Improves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp reduction in the losses of US Sprint
Communications Co. contributed to higher third-quarter profits at
United Telecommunications Inc., which is half-owner of the
long-distance company along with GTE Corp., United Telecom said
Tuesday.
   United Telecommunications said US Sprint's pre-tax loss fell to
$19 million in the third quarter, from $165 million in the third
quarter of 1987 and $112 million in the second quarter of 1988.
   US Sprint's revenue rose 34 percent to $916 million in the third
quarter from $685 million a year earlier. Revenue for the first
nine months rose to $2.48 billion from $1.85 billion a year earlier.
   After taxes, United Telecom's share of the loss of US Sprint was
reduced to $44,000 in the third quarter and $77.9 million in the
first nine months, compared with $44.7 million and $296.5 million
in the respective periods a year earlier.
   United Telecom, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., said it
earned $54 million, or 52 cents a share, in the third quarter, up
from $25.8 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
for units other than US Sprint rose to $805.8 million from $750.6
million.
   For the first nine months, United Telecom said it registered a
profit of $127.1 million, or $1.18 a share, compared with a loss of
$80.7 million a year earlier. Revenue excluding US Sprint rose to
$2.33 billion from $2.18 billion.
   GTE said it would release its quarterly results at a later date.
GTE is scheduled to sell 30.1 percent of US Sprint for $600 million
at the beginning of 1989, leaving itself with 19.9 percent of the
long-distance carrier.

   A bank holding company with branches in 72
countries was named in indictments unsealed today in what
prosecutors said was the first case in which an entire banking
institution faced charges for drug-related money-laundering.
   The Luxembourg-based bank holding company, Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, three of its subsidiaries and nine of its
officers are named in the three indictments unsealed here. In all,
indictments announced here and five other U.S. cities name 85
defendants.
   The bank, prosecutors said, is the world's seventh-largest
privately held financial institution. Most large banks have stock
that is publicly traded.
   The trade journal American Banker said Bank of Credit and
Commerce International ranks as No. 326 among the world's biggest
banks as measured by deposits and No. 378 as measured by assets.
   ``It is the first time an entire international financial
institution and its important members have been indicted,'' said
William Von Raab, head of the U.S. Customs Service.
   The announcement of the indictments followed the arrest of nine
people here Sunday after they had been lured to a fictitious
wedding.
   The ring was based in Tampa, Von Raab said, and was infiltrated
two years ago by federal undercover agents who were soon getting
tips from traffickers on how to launder the funds. The money was
intended principally for Colombian drug traffickers, including the
Medellin Cartel, Customs said.
   The bank received a portion of the $32 million in drug money to
be laundered, place it in certificates of deposit, then loaned it
out to the traffickers. The bank then paid off the loan with the
CDs it already had, officials said.
   Eight U.S. cities were involved, along with branches in the
North and South American and Europe, and drug agents from England
and France participated in busting the ring.
   With officials from those two countries at his side, Von Raab
praised the international cooperation that led to the indictments
in what Customs calls ``Operation C-Chase,'' after the term C-note.
   ``Colombian traffickers are really looking to Europe to improve
their markets,'' Von Raab said, saying cocaine prices were double
on that continent and banking regulations were looser. ``But they
can't without help from financial institutions _ that's why this
case is important.''
   In addition to the indictments unsealed here, indictments were
unsealed in New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago and Houston.
Warrants were also issued in Los Angeles, Miami, London and Paris.
   As of this morning, at least 40 people have been arrested around
the world, including the United States, England and Argentina,
officials said.
   BCCI attorney Marty Steinberg in Miami said prior to the
unsealing of the indictments that he did not know details of the
case.
   ``We haven't been provided with any specific allegations. We're
anxiously waiting to see what the charges are,'' said Steinberg.
   The nine people arrested here Sunday were invited to the wedding
by a U.S. Customs agent playing the role of a drug financier
seeking advice on money laundering, The Tampa Tribune reported
today.
   ``It was a Cecil B. DeMille production,'' the unidentified
federal official said of the fictitious wedding.
   The nine were being held in the Hillsborough County Jail without
bail.

   Stock prices drifted at broadly lower levels
this afternoon, as a combination of profit-taking, speculation
about new economic data due later this week and higher interest
rates depressed prices.
   Trading was described as moderate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 8.71 points

   They feel that slower growth means inflation poses no immediate
problem and that the Federal Reserve will feel no compulsion to
tighten credit.
   But they are already looking ahead to the release of August
trade figures due later this week.
   The bond market was lower today after taking Monday off for the
observance of Columbus Day. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were
up to 8.85 percent.
   Analysts said today's stock price decline reflected some
profit-taking after a nearly 57-point advance in the Dow Jones
industrial average over the past four sessions.

have discouraged stock investors, particularly foreigners.

<HEAD>Next To Sell Two Retail Jewelry Divisions to Ratners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next PLC, a British fashion retailer, said Tuesday
it has agreed to sell 433 Salisburys and Zales and other jewelry
stores in Britain to Ratners Group PLC for the equivalent of $232
million.
   The sale follows last year's bidding war between Next and
Ratners over Combined English Stores Group PLC, a diversified
retail chain which included the Salisburys and Zales jewelry store
chains.
   Next ultimately won the takeover battle, paying about 338
million pounds, or $581 million, in new Next shares.
   At the time of the takeover, Next discussed the sale to Ratners
of some of the Combined English Store jewelry stores, but these
talks broke down.
   Also included in the sale announced Tuesday are 73 jewelry
stores which previously formed part of the Collingwoods and J. Weir
chains, also acquired by Next as part of the Combined English
Stores takeover.
   ``Next will retain those CES stores which most naturally fit
into the Next retail format and will sell to Ratners those stores
currently selling jewelry and accessories which don't, thereby
raising cash for the further development of the group's core
businesses,'' Next said in a statement.
   The acquisition of Zales marks a significant move by Ratners
into the medium-level jewelry market, while Salisburys broadens its
business to include fashion accessories.
   The two subsidiaries had combined operating profit of 9.5
million pounds on sales of 83.5 million pounds in the year ended
Jan. 31.
   Ratners, which specializes in low-cost jewelry, currently has
about 1,140 stores in Britain and the United States, according to
analysts.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower on Yen and Pound Strength, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in European trading Tuesday,
pressured by investor interest in the Japanese yen and the British
pound and cautious market sentiment ahead of Thursday's release of
U.S. trade figures.
   Gold prices were slightly lower.
   Dealers said the dollar's weakness against the yen was triggered
in Tokyo trading by a large order to sell dollars for yen, which
prompted other stop loss orders.
   Two market sources in London said Salomon Brothers in Tokyo sold
one billion dollars for yen during the Tokyo day on behalf of a
client. An official at Salomon Brothers in London refused to
comment, saying the investment bank never discusses its trading
activities.
   Dealers said the American currency's weak tone also has
encouraged investors to sell dollars and buy other high-yielding
currencies such as the pound.
   The momentum of the pound's rise Monday continued on Tuesday and
the Bank of England reportedly intervened to keep the market from
getting carried away.
   ``There was no suggestion that the bank was putting a top on the
pound or forcing it lower,'' said one London dealer. ``It was just
a normal smoothing operation.''
   The Bank of England refused to comment on the reports of
intervention.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the market was waiting for Thursday's
U.S. trade report.
   Economists were forecasting an August deficit of $11.3 billion,
wider than July's deficit of $9.53 billion.
   ``The trade figures will be the trigger of any movement'' on the
foreign exchange market, said one Frankfurt trader.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 2.35 yen to a closing 131.15 yen from
Friday's 133.50 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower
rate of 130.80 yen. The Tokyo market was closed on Monday for a
holiday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Higher On Export News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop futures prices closed mostly higher Tuesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to signs of stronger
foreign demand for U.S. grains and soybeans, analysts said.
   Reports that China was bidding for 400,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat sparked speculative and commercial buying of
wheat futures, which had been slipping after making new
life-of-contract high prices last week.
   Egypt and Yugoslavia were said to be in the market for U.S.
corn, and exporters said Taiwan had purchased 54,000 metric tons of
soybeans.
   But gains were limited by expectations that the Agriculture
Department will increase its corn and soybean harvest estimates in
a crop production report scheduled for release Wednesday afternoon,
analysts said.
   ``That type of attitude may also prevail a bit tomorrow'' in
trading ahead of the report, said Ted Mao, a grain specialist in
New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``But, barring any major surprises, I would not view this crop
report as the major one,'' he said. ``We already know the general
size of the crop. This report is just fine tuning.''
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 6{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.34 a bushel; corn was 2\
cents lower to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.95\ cents a
bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7} cents higher with December at
$2.54} cents a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 5\ cents higher with
November at $7.93 a bushel.

   The stock market recovered some lost ground this
afternoon, but was still lower for the day. The pace of trading was
moderate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 8.71 points
to a post-crash high on Monday, was off 3.20 at 2,155.76 with one
hour left in the session. The index was down as much as 16.53
points earlier in the day.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 9 to 5 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 522 up, 867 down
and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.29 million shares at 3 p.m.
on Wall Street, compared with 106.72 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Investors have taken some reassurance from recent government
reports that the economy is growing at a more moderate pace than
earlier this year.
   They feel that slower growth means inflation poses no immediate
problem and that the Federal Reserve will feel no compulsion to
tighten credit.
   But they are already looking ahead to the release of August
trade figures due later this week, and some analysts expect a
bigger deficit than in July.
   The bond market was lower today after taking Monday off for the
observance of Columbus Day. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were
up to 8.85 percent.
   Analysts said today's activity reflected some profit-taking
after a nearly 57-point advance in the Dow Jones industrial average
over the past four sessions. A decline in the dollar in foreign
exchange trading may also have discouraged stock investors,
particularly foreigners.

<TEXT>
   London's Stock Exchange on Tuesday announced a
relaxation of its listing requirements for foreign firms, in an
effort to attract more overseas companies to the market.
   Overseas firms that satisfy certain basic requirements will be
permitted to disclose financial information for the three most
recent years, rather than for the five years required previously.
   The basic requirements include a five-year trading record and
compliance with internationally accepted accounting rules. The
company must also have been listed for at least two years on an
overseas exchange, and the value of its shares in public hands must
exceed 150 million pounds, or the equivalent of $258 million.
   The Stock Exchange said the relaxation brings its rules in line
with European Community listing requirements.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Industry Challenge to Smokestack Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business challenges to federal environmental
rules governing the use of high smokestacks to disperse air
pollution were rejected Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   In another case, the justices refused to revive a challenge to
the way Laurence A. Tisch became president of CBS Inc., letting
stand rulings that his assumption of power two years ago did not
amount to a transfer of control requiring prior approval by the
Federal Communications Commission.
   The court also refused to kill a lawsuit charging Boeing Co.
with illegal age bias because it bars pilots from active flight
status when they reach 60.
   In the environmental case, the justices, without comment, left
intact a lower court ruling that strengthened clean air regulations
by limiting the use of smokestacks as a substitute for other
pollution controls.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled in January that the
Environmental Protection Agency validly adopted the regulations
involving use of high smokestacks in 1985.
   Building taller stacks, the leading technique of dispersal,
generally is cheaper than cutting emissions. But environmentalists
say that while dispersing the pollution may provide cleaner air in
the vicinity of plants and factories, it adds to the overall
pollution in the atmosphere.
   The rules upheld by the appealse futures trading on the New York Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Tuesday:

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Withdraws $5 Billion Bid for Kroger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co.'s stock slumped Tuesday after buyout
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. withdrew its $5.03 billion
takeover bid, saying it concluded the supermarket chain is ``not
for sale at any price.''
   In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kroger stock
fell $2.62{ a share to $55, far below Kohlberg's cash-and-stock
offer that was valued at $64 a share.
   In a letter to Kroger, Kohlberg said: ``While we are perplexed
that the board found our proposal to acquire the company ... at 28
times earnings to be inadequate, we were not even asked if we were
in a position to improve our offer. We can only conclude that the
board has decided that the company is not for sale at any price.''
   Kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals.
   Paul Bernish, a spokesman at Kroger's headquarters in
Cincinnati, had no comment except to note that the company was
proceeding with its previously announced restructuring plan.
   Bidding for Kroger began last month when Maryland's Haft family
offered to acquire the big supermarket chain for $55 a share.
Kohlberg came on the scene with a $58.50-a-share offer but last
week sweetened the proposal to $64 a share.
   Although financial analysts had said Kroger managers might be
pressured to accept Kohlberg's latest offer, the company's board
denounced the proposal last week as inadequate and put its
restructuring plan in motion by laying off 300 employees. Kroger
also has announced plans to sell off certain assets.
   Analysts speculated Kohlberg bowed out of the contest because
the aggressive New York buyout firm did not want to proceed in a
hostile manner and launch a tender offer.
   ``It would hurt their image of being a white knight and a
defender of management,'' said Kimberly Walin, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Kohlberg rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover, in
part because the success of its deals typically depends on having
existing management remain with the target company.
   But analysts also were not convinced that Kohlberg was entirely
out of the picture.
   ``It's possible that if something negative develops, that KKR
might be able to come back with a lower offer,'' said Linda Morris,
a retail analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   She suggested Kohlberg might be waiting in the wings to see if
any new lawsuits surfaced that charge the Kroger board with
breaching its fiduciary duties for failing to negotiate the best
price for shareholders.
   At least four shareholders' suits already were filed against
Kroger contending that the restructuring plan was not in
shareholders' best interests.
   Kroger valued its restructuring at between $57 and $61 a share,
but Kohlberg challenged those figures, noting that the financial
community had put a pricetag of between $53 to $56 a share on the
plan.
   Under terms of the restructuring, Kroger would distribute a
special dividend of $40 in cash plus notes and stock for each
Kroger share.
   Disagreements over the value of the plan centered on a ``stub''
share of stock that Kroger officials estimated would trade at
between $9 and $13 a share. Wall Street investors, however,
estimated the stub's value as low as $5 a share.
   Analysts discounted the effect Kohlberg's withdrawal might have
on the Haft bid. The Hafts, who control Dart Group Corp. and have a
reputation as corporate raiders, ``still have their fingers in the
pie ... but I'd be surprised if they were serious,'' Morris said.
   Furthermore, after rejecting the Kohlberg bid as inadequate, it
would be difficult for Kroger to look favorably upon the Haft
proposal, which was considered inferior by the investment community.
   The Hafts offered last week to help Kroger fight the Kohlberg
bid by proposing to provide additional equity for Kroger's
restructuring.
   Dart Group President Robert Haft reiterated Tuesday that the
family ``remains interested in working with Kroger to strengthen
the company and enhance their restructuring by providing additional
equity.''
   He declined to comment on whether the Haft bid has been
withdrawn. But representatives of the Haft family ``had contact''
with Kroger management last week about remaining involved with the
company, a source said.
   The 105-year-old Kroger has 170,000 employees and 52,000
shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets
and convenience stores. Kroger operates more than 1,300
supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses
in 29 states.

<HEAD>EEC, Developing Nations Open New Trade, Aid Pact Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community and 66
developing nations open formal negotiations Wednesday for a new
five-year, multi-billion dollar aid and trade accord due to take
effect in 1990.
   The negotiations are expected to last at least a year, officials
said on the eve of the talks.
   At issue is the renewal of an accord under which the EEC grants
the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations duty and
quota-free access for virtually all their industrial and farm
goods, soft loans for development projects and financial guarantees
against drops in commodity export prices.
   The first such five-year accord was signed in Lome, the capital
of Togo, in 1975 and the second so-called Lome Convention was
concluded in 1980.
   The third, signed in 1984 and worth 8.5 billion European
currency units ($9.5 billion), expires at the end of February, 1990.
   The aid comes from the EEC's Development Fund and is separate
from the food aid the EEC grants annually to the developing nations.
   The price tag on the fourth accord is open for negotiations but
will doubtlessly exceed that of the current treaty.
   The new talks open against the backdrop of the EEC's plan to
forge a single, borderless market within the EEC by 1992.
   This plan fueled concern within the ACP nations that the EEC
will become less sensitive to the need to support imports from them.
   For its part, the EEC is expected to insist that ACP nations
implement sounder economic policies as outlined by the
International Monetary Fund.
   The EEC has had special trade links with developing nations for
25 years. But this has not significantly raised the wealth of the
recipient nations and today, not one ACP nation figures on the list
of newly industrialized nations.
   The 12 EEC member States, which were not able to agree on
precise offers to make to their ACP associates, adopted a vague
position which allows them to open the talks but postpones the
problems.
   The EEC countries disagree on the future status of the Stabex,
the system which guarantees the ACP States part of their farm
export earnings. Some want it linked to stricter economic policies
but others object. Another question is whether the funds will be
reimbursed or not.
   Another problem is the further trade liberalization the EEC is
ready to grant the ACPs. Spain and Italy fear the increased
competition of tropical products will harm their own Mediterranean
production.
   But the biggest obstacle seems to be the shape of the future aid
the EEC is willing to give. Should it be long-term development
funds or emergency assistance, enabling the associates to overcome
their debt problems and start some kind of economic revival?
   Finally, the question of human rights is likely to arise again.
The EEC wants it mentioned in the new convention while the ACP
states consider it an interference in their internal affairs.

<HEAD>Toyota Looking for 1.5 Million in Annual Sales for Mid '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., will increase U.S.
sales to about 1.5 million cars and trucks annually by the
mid-1990s _ a twofold sales boost fueled by a new truck plant, a
company executive said Tuesday.
   At the introduction of the Japanese automaker's 1989 models, Bob
McCurry, executive vice president for sales and operations for the
U.S. arm of the company, said he didn't know where that plant would
be located.
   ``We've got to get a truck plant'' in the United States, he said
flatly, adding it would take about 2{ years from site selection to
production at a new truck plant.
   The light truck market in the United States has been booming,
and industry analysts aren't sure where it will level off. Included
in the category are pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and the
popular minivans.
   Toyota now imports a wide variety of pickup trucks with assorted
cab and bed sizes. The company also builds a van in Japan and
brings it to the United States, but sales of the vehicle have been
slipping against stiff competition from domestic and overseas
minivan makers.
   McCurry said the Toyota van is designed for Japanese consumers,
and that a new small van would be built in Japan specifically for
the U.S. market.
   For the first nine months of this year, Toyota has sold 684,961
cars and trucks in the United States, up 1.4 percent over the same
period last year. The reason that percentage isn't higher, McCurry
said, was a limited availability of the vehicles from Japan.
   But he added, that will change.
   ``By 1995, if we implement all our plans, nearly half of our
products will be built right here in North America and many of them
will have more American content than some Big Three products,'' he
said.

   A midafternoon recovery fell short and the stock
market finished lower Tuesday, a day after one key index reached
its highest level since last October's crash.
   Analysts blamed profit-taking, lingering worries about the
economy and interest rates and general investor wariness for the
pullback.
   Bill Raftery, a market analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., said investors were acting like reluctant grooms being dragged
to the altar.
   ``He's going in kicking and screaming. There doesn't seem to be
any overwhelming desire to own stocks,'' he said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 8.71 points
to a post-crash high on Monday, fell back 2.49 to close at 2,156.47.
   But that was an improvement from midday when the market's
best-known index was down more than 16 points as the lunch hour
ended.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 3-to-2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
593 issues up, 823 down and 535 unchanged. The NYSE composite index
slipped 0.19 to 156.77.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 140.90 million shares,
up from 124.66 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
167.35 million shares.
   Analysts said investors continue to exhibit little confidence
about the longterm direction for the economy and interest rates.
   While some recent government reports have indicated the economy
is growing at a more moderate pace, investors seem reluctant to buy
stocks in advance of knowing what the next set of economic
statistics may show.
   ``The market has been living in fits and starts,'' said Alfred
E. Goldman, director of technical market analysis for A.G. Edwards
& Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``Trends last a day-and-a-half and are
usually tied to today's news.''
   He said investors focus on the latest economic report, and noted
they have plenty to look to this week. The government plans to
report this week on the August trade balance and on September
wholesale prices.
   Jack Baker, head of block trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said the market's pullback also reflected a decline of the
dollar in foreign exchange trading, which serves to discourage
foreign investment in U.S. stocks.
   He said profit-taking also occurred as the market had sent the
Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 57 points over the past four
sessions.
   The bond market provided little encouragement for stocks.
   Prices were lower and interest rates edged higher with yields on
30-year Treasury bonds rising to 8.85 percent from 8.79 percent
last Friday.
   Kroger tumbled 2| to 55 after the investment form Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. withdrew its buyout proposal of $64 a share.
Kroger had rejected its overtures and had proposed a restructuring.
   Tenneco fell | to 49[. The company said Monday it had agreed to

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

S&P's 500-stock composite index was off 0.31 at 277.93.

<HEAD>3rd Quarter Net Doubles at International Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. said Tuesday its net
income nearly doubled in the third quarter, boosted by strong
demand, cost-control measures and acquisitions.
   In the three months ended Sept. 30, International Paper's
after-tax income totaled $201 million, or $1.74 a share, compared
with a net profit of $102 million, or 92 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion from $2 billion.
   For the first nine months, net income totaled $548 million, or
$4.76 a share, up 94 percent from $282 million, or $2.54 a share,
in 1987. Revenue rose 21 percent to $7 billion from $5.8 billion.
   The earnings report was released a day after the paperworkers
union called off a 16-month-old strike at International Paper mills
in three states without winning an agreement from the company.
   John A. Georges, chairman of the Purchase, N.Y.-based company,
said Tuesday that the packaging materials and white paper
operations put in a particularly strong performance. He said demand
and pricing for paper and paperboard products should remain strong
into the next year.
   Cost-control measures that were put into place some time ago are
continuing to have a positive impact on profit levels, spokesman H.
Ann Silvernail added.
   In addition, the company is continuing to see a benefit from the
acquisitions of Anitec and Kendall late last year. Anitec makes
photosensitive papers and Kendall manufactures non-woven fabrics.
   During the latest quarter, International Paper announced the
$400 million cash acquisition of Masonite, a subsidiary of USG
Corp. With 1987 sales of $529 million, Masonite is a major producer
of composite wood products for the furniture and home construction
industries.

   Two former bank executives surrendered to federal
authorities Tuesday to begin serving prison terms imposed after
they pleaded guilty to crimes that helped bring Continental
Illinois Bank to the brink of bankruptcy.
   John R. Lytle, 53, a former Continental Illinois vice president,
appeared before noon at the Federal Prison Camp in Oxford, Wis.,
said camp administrator Charles Stewart. He will serve a 3{-year
term after being sentenced Aug. 30 by U.S. District Judge Milton
Shadur.
   William G. Patterson, the head of energy lending at the
now-defunct Penn Square bank of Oklahoma City, surrendered to
authorities at the Federal Prison Camp at Big Springs, Texas. He
was sentenced to serve 2 years.
   The maximum sentence Shadur could have imposed on either
defendant under terms of the plea bargain was five years.
   Lytle and Patterson admitted taking part in a scheme in which
Lytle took kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have Continental
Illinois buy millions of dollars in risky energy loans from Penn
Square Bank of Oklahoma City.
   Lytle pleaded guilty to one charge of misapplication of bank
funds; Patterson to a single count of aiding and abetting Lytle.
   Continental Illinois Bank, saddled with a host of troublesome
energy loans and loans to third world countries, was saved from
collapse in 1984 by a $4.5 billion federal bailout package.

<HEAD>Greenspan Praises New Capital Requirements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that broad new guidelines for increasing banks' capital are
the key to maintaining stability in the financial world.
   ``Capital acts as a buffer against unexpected shocks to a firm,
and thereby helps to insulate both individual firms and the system
from risk,'' Greenspan said at the 114th annual convention of the
American Bankers Association.
   Greenspan also assured bankers that the repeal of the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and
investment banking, remains one of the Fed's highest priorities.
   Bankers have been trying to gain a foothold in the securities
industry for the past several years, arguing that it is necessary
to compete more efficiently with banks abroad.
   Banking reform legislation has been tossed around in Congress,
although it appears unlikely any major changes will come this year.
   To help maintain a more level playing field between banks here
and abroad, the United States and 11 other industrialized nations
agreed in July to standardize capital requirements for banks by
1992.
   Capital represents a financial cushion of profits and
stockholder money reserved for times of stress. The purpose of the
international accord was to link capital requirements to the
riskiness of bank assets.
   Under the new guidelines, all of the nation's 14,000 commercial
banks will be required to have capital reserves equivalent to 8
percent of assets, weighted by risk, in the next four years. The
total capital requirement now is 6 percent.
   Greenspan praised the new guidelines, which the Fed voted to
enact in August, as a way of ``providing shock absorbers'' for the
financial system by discouraging excessive risk-taking.
   ``There is no better way to ensure that owners exert discipline
on the behavior of their firm than to require that the owners have
a large stake in that enterprise,'' Greenspan said. ``The safety
and soundness of the financial system requires that banks have
adequate capital.''
   The new guidelines will force several money center banks to
raise as much as $15 billion. Experts predict that many banks will
have to issue new stock and sell some assets to raise their capital
base.
   ``I recognize that some of these banks, not feeling market
pressure to raise capital ratios, may consider increased capital
requirements unnecessarily burdensome,'' Greenspan said. ``However,
given the existence of the federal safety net, market signals
regarding the level of capital may not be appropriate from a
broader perspective.''

<TEXT>
   The Port of Seattle announced Tuesday it has
named the No. 2 executive for the port of Rotterdam in the
Netherlands as its new executive director.
   Zeger van Asch van Wijck, adjunct director for the port of
Rotterdam, will replace Jim Dwyer, who has resigned.
   Van Wijck, 41, was approved unanimously by the Seattle port
commission, the panel's President Henry Aronson said. He will
assume his new duties in January. John Belford will continue as
interim director until then.
   The director, who answers to the Port of Seattle Commission,
oversees nearly $1 billion in assets, including Seattle's giant
marine terminals and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The port
employs 1,100.
   Aronson said van Wijck, who has held his Rotterdam post for 3{
years, was chosen because of his international experience with one
of the world's top ports.
   The port of Rotterdam handled 255 million metric tons of cargo
last year, including 2.84 million containers. The Port of Seattle
handled 10.4 million metric tons, including 1.03 million containers.
   The executive's annual salary is estimated to be $125,000.
   Some in Seattle's marine industry questioned why the port
commission went to Europe to find a new director.
   ``I'm shocked they went outside the country, but from what I
gather the people at the port are happy they're getting him, so
we'll just wait and see,'' said Bill Laurence, vice president of
the Pacific Coast chapter of American Waterways Operators.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Retreat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices fell sharply Tuesday, giving back
most of the previous day's gains after gold ran into resistance at
$410 an ounce.
   On other markets, cocoa futures plummeted; grains and soybeans
advanced; livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures
were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Gold may be headed below $400 a troy ounce, the key
psychological barrier it struggled past last week, analysts said.
   After climbing $5.40 to $408.60 a troy ounce Monday on New
York's Commodity Exchange, spot gold prices peaked at $410 Monday
night on overseas markets, then began to retreat.
   Gold for October delivery on the Comex settled at $404.40 a troy
ounce, down $4.20 from Monday's final price.
   ``The markets basically got up to their first main resistance
area, then started picking up selling, which seemed to accelerate
throughout the day,'' said David Syphen, manager of metals futures
trading for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   ``This is an indication that the gold market is still
fundamentally on the defensive and may retest the previous lows
below $395,'' he said.
   Spot gold fell to $392 an ounce on the Comex late last month,
reflecting slack investment demand and low inflation.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York said rising crude oil prices and a softer dollar early in
the session held some promise of supporting gold prices. But those
markets reversed direction later in the day.
   On the Comex, gold settled $4.20 to $4.30 lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $408.40 a troy ounce; silver
was 14.2 cents to 14.7 cents lower with December at $6.275 a troy
ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $7.30 to
$8.10 lower with October at $513.10 a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures prices plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange, ending a seven-day rally that had pushed the
December contract up $174 a metric ton.
   The market gave up more than a third of its recent gains on
Tuesday in what traders termed a mostly technical correction.
   Cocoa futures are at 13-year lows due to a glut of cocoa and the
inability of producer and consumer nations to agree on a
price-support program.
   Cocoa settled $51 to $74 lower with December at $1,216 a metric
ton.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in response to a surge in foreign demand, analysts
said.
   Reports that China was bidding for 400,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat sparked speculative and commercial buying of
wheat futures. Egypt and Yugoslavia were said to be in the market
for U.S. corn, and exporters said Taiwan had purchased 54,000
metric tons of soybeans.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced the Soviet
Union had purchased 250,000 metric tons of corn. The USDA also said
it had targeted Mexico for 300,000 metric tons of subsidized wheat.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 6} cents higher with December at
$4.34\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2\ cents higher with
December at $2.95 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7} cents higher
with December at $2.54} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents
higher with November at $7.93{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures posted modest losses on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on technical factors while pork futures were narrowly
mixed on a combination of steady cash hog prices and light retail
demand, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .45 cent lower with October at
72.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .48 cent lower
with October at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with October at 40.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .18 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 48 cents
a pound.
   Crude oil futures prices seesawed in nervous trading before
finishing slightly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gasoline and heating oil futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 9 cents
lower with November at $13.55 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
lower to .12 cent higher with November at 39.08 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .62 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
November at 40.79 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled .70 point lower at 279.60.

<HEAD>Consolidated, Newmont Sue To Block Minorco Takeover On Antitrust
Grounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and Newmont Mining
Corp. said they filed a federal suit Tuesday to block a $3.5
billion hostile buyout bid by a South African conglomerate, on
grounds the offer violates federal securities and antitrust laws.
   The U.S. District Court suit was the latest action the companies
have taken to thwart the overture by South African-controlled
Minorco SA, which has offered $3.5 billion for the 70.6 percent of
Consolidated Gold Fields it does not already own.
   London-based Gold Fields owns a 49.3 percent stake in Newmont.
   Gold Fields and New York-based Newmont last week asked President
Reagan to block the takeover on national security grounds,
contending a buyout would endanger U.S. access to strategic metals
such as gold, platinum and zirconium.
   Gold Fields has asked the British government to review the bid
because of the South African connection, and the South African
government also is investigating the proposed acquisition.
   Named as defendants in the suit filed Tuesday were Anglo
American Corp. of South Africa Ltd., De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., and Minorco.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco, which owns 29.4 percent of Gold
Fields, is controlled by Anglo American and De Beers Consolidated
Mines, the gold and diamond mining interests of the wealthy
Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
   Anglo American and De Beers have said they would relinquish
control of Minorco if the bid succeeds. Minorco has said it plans
to sell Gold Fields' South African interests and Gold Fields' stake
in Newmont if it acquires the company.
   The Gold Fields-Newmont suit contended the defendants had
conspired to monopolize the gold market and that a successful
acquisition likely would substantially lessen competition in that
market.
   Gold Fields controls 8 percent of the world's gold production.
It also produces rutile and zircon, which are raw materials for
metals used in military aircraft and submarines.
   The suit claimed a takeover of Gold Fields by Minorco would give
the South African syndicate control over a third of the world's
gold market.
   The suit stated the Oppenheimer syndicate has major investments
in companies that control more than 20 percent of the West's gold
production, has interests controlling more than 50 percent of the
free world's platinum production and has what it claimed the
Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation consider
``an absolute monopoly'' over the diamond business.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. on Tuesday
reported its profit rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter on a 10
percent increase in revenues.
   The company said net income rose to $204.6 million, or $1.41 per
common share, compared with $180.6 million, or $1.25 a share, in
the 1987 third quarter. Revenue during the quarter ended Sept. 30
totaled $3.06 billion, up from $2.77 billion a year ago.
   Westinghouse Chairman John C. Marous said the company's
industries segment had significantly higher revenues. He also
reported higher revenues for the financial services, broadcasting
and electronic systems segments.
   However, revenues for its energy and utility systems and
commercial segments were down for the third quarter.
   ``Order activity remained strong,'' Marous said. ``We are
meeting our sales and earnings targets, and we expect that 1988
will be another good year of growth and improvements in
operations.''
   For the first nine months, the company reported profits of
$574.1 million, or $3.95 per common share, on revenues of $8.85
billion, up 13.7 percent from profits of $505 million, or $3.51 per
common share, on revenues of $8.04 billion in the first nine months
of 1987.

<HEAD>Casino Commission Approves Griffin's Plans To Purchase Resorts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with new 7th graf to include Tuesday's closing stock

<TEXT>
   A regulatory board Tuesday gave
unanimous approval to entertainer Merv Griffin's offer to buy
Resorts International Inc., its casinos and property, despite
lingering questions about whether Griffin will complete the deal.
   ``Thank you for the unanimous vote,'' Griffin told the Casino
Control Commission after its ruling. ``It was a vote of
confidence.''
   The commission's decision came a day after Griffin's company
announced it had allowed a deadline for its $36-per-share tender
offer to Resorts' stockholders to expire. The move gave rise to
speculation that Griffin was trying to back out of the deal.
   Griffin told reporters after the ruling that the speculation was
``ridiculous,'' but that allowing the deadline to expire was
designed to allow him to get out of the deal if conditions were not
favorable.
   ``It gives me the right to continue on and close (the deal) as
quickly as I can,'' he said. ``It gives me a chance to leave it if
all things aren't in place.
   ``I want to be able to stay very fluid and to be able to make a
businessman's decision, and to walk if everything is not done,''
Griffin added.
   Monday's announcement that Griffin had declined to extend the
deadline drove down the price of Resorts stock by $4.875 but they
rebounded on Tuesday, closing up $3 at $32.125.
   Under the deal, Griffin would purchase Resorts' stock, including
that owned by billionaire developer Donald Trump. Griffin would
take control of the Resorts International Casino Hotel, Resorts'
vast land holdings in Atlantic City, and a casino and property
Resorts owns in the Bahamas.
   Trump would purchase from Resorts its unfinished, 1,250-room Taj
Majal casino next door to Resorts' gaming hall on the Boardwalk in
Atlantic City.
   Griffin is still awaiting approval from the Bahamian government
on his request to purchase Resorts' property there. The commission
has not yet acted on his request for a permanent casino license,
although it granted him a 90-day license Tuesday.
   His attorney, Howard Goldberg, assured the commission that
Griffin wasn't pulling out of the sale.
   ``I hate to paraphrase Mark Twain,'' he said, ``but the rumors
about the death of this deal are greatly exaggerated.''
   Goldberg said the refusal to extend the tender offer gives
Griffin ``flexibility'' to reconsider the deal if market conditions
take a downward slide or if Griffin fails to get approvals he is
waiting for.
   Robert Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization
and the brother of Donald, said he was confused by Griffin's
announcement.
   ``We didn't quite understand it,'' he said.
   ``I read and re-read the (Griffin news) releases and I don't
know what they mean,'' said Joel Sterns, an attorney for Resorts.
   Reading from a prepared text, Griffin said if an acquisition is
completed, it would be done through a merger, not a tender offer.
   A merger offer was approved Aug. 30 by the required number of
shareholders, said Griffin.
   Griffin, who recently has turned his attention to real estate,
would take the company private by buying out Trump's controlling
stock and all remaining shares.
   Griffin and Trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control
of Resorts, but appeared to have come to terms about their
differences and worked out the deal now in question.
   Under the proposal, Griffin would pay Trump $135 a share, or $96
million, for Trump's Class B stock. Trump also would receive
another $63 million from Griffin to break Trump's management
contract with Resorts.
   Griffin's tender offer for Class A stockholders would cost him
$205.2 million. Griffin would also invest $50 million in Resorts to
help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest payments on
Resorts' debt.
   In turn, Trump would pay Resorts $273 million for the Taj Mahal.
   Trump announced Tuesday that Resorts International's board of
directors set Oct. 31 as a deadline for closing the deal.
   If the deadline passes, Resorts may take ``other actions as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances,'' said a statement
released by the company. It did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Macmillan Posts $1.1 Million Loss for 3rd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. said Tuesday it lost nearly $1.1
million in the third quarter as it took a charge for disposing of
some inventory and recorded expenses related to tender offers being
made for the company.
   The latest loss contrasts with Macmillan's earnings of $43.3
million in the July-through-September period a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 5.9 percent to $340.7 million from
$322.2 million in 1987.
   The company said it took a charge of $29.4 million for a
disposal of inventory resulting from its decision to close its
Scribner Laidlaw elementary school book line and to reorganize its
educational publishing group to achieve economies within its
elementary and high school textbook publishing business.
   It said the results also reflected expenses of $39.7 million
resulting from the tender offers and the company's own proposed
restructuring, later dropped.
   Since mid-May, Macmillan has been the target of competing offers
from the groups led by Texan Robert M. Bass, British publisher
Robert Maxwell and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   It proposed a restructuring plan that would have divided the
company into separate publishing and information services companies
but later abandoned it.
   It has accepted a $2.5 billion offer from the Kohlberg group
that includes members of its senior management, although Maxwell
has offered $2.51 billion under certain conditions and is
challenging the company's agreement with the Kohlberg group in
court.
   For the first nine months of the year, Macmillan said it earned
$9.5 million, or 40 cents a share, down 83 percent from $55.3
million, or $2.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 8.4 percent to $764.3 million from
$704.9 million a year earlier.

<HEAD>Fish Shells Might Make Reheated Meat Taste Better, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last night's meat loaf might keep for several
more days with the addition of a substance from the shells of crabs
and lobsters, an Agriculture Department scientist said Tuesday.
   John R. Vercelloti, a chemist at the department's Southern
Regional Research Center in New Orleans, said the substance, called
chitin, inhibits a warmed-over flavor in uncured meat, poultry or
fish that is cooked, stored and reheated.
   The additives have shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the
off-taste for up to five days when mixed with hamburger, he said.
   Vercelloti, in a report issued here by the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said TV dinners, microwave foods and
leftovers are prime candidates for off-tastes. Meats cured with
nitrite, such as bacon, ham and lunch meats don't have such
problems, he said.
   The warmed-over flavor also is described by the food industry as
``cardboardy'' or ``painty.'' The off-taste is caused when fat in
the uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated.
   Vercellotti and a fellow chemist, Allen J. St. Angelo, are
seeking a patent on additives made from chitin, which he described
as ``a surplus material from the shellfish industry.'' Chitin is
most commonly found in the shells of lobsters, crabs and other
shellfish.
   The warmed-over flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmosphere
breaks down fats in the meat, the report said. Large amounts of
iron present in meat speeds up the oxidation.
   But when the chitin additives are added to the meat, they bind
the iron so it cannot speed up the oxidation, thus slowing down the
development of the warmed-over flavor.
   Chitin additives would have to be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration before being available to consumers, the scientists
said.

<HEAD>Disney Takes Case for Buyout to Polaroid Employees in Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. and would-be buyer Roy E.
Disney battled for support of the company's workers Tuesday, with
Disney publishing a letter of reassurance about his plans for an
employee stock plan.
   Disney, who through his Shamrock Holdings Inc. is pressing an
unsolicited $2.6 billion offer for the instant film maker, also
suggested a buyout would increase job security by making Polaroid
``a vigorous, productive and more progressive company.''
   Disney, the millionaire nephew of the late animator Walt Disney,
addressed the workers in an open letter to be published Wednesday
in newspaper advertisements near Polaroid's Cambridge, Mass.,
headquarters and released earlier to the press.
   The letter said Burbank-based Shamrock's attempts to overturn a
new employee stock ownership plan as part of its buyout would be
replaced with unspecified opportunities for workers to profit from
anticipated growth at Polaroid.
   Polaroid officials refused to comment on the open letter, but
did reveal that it had rejected an Oct. 7 request by Shamrock
President Stanley Gold to meet with the employees.
   That refusal was in keeping with company policy against putting
outside speakers in touch with employees, said I. MacAllister
Booth, Polaroid's president and chief executive officer.
   Shamrock, the vehicle for Disney's diverse investments, has made
a $42-a-share tender offer to Polaroid stockholders for a majority
of the company's 61.9 million shares. That offer is valid only if a
recently announced employee stock ownership plan is overturned.
Under the plan, the company would issue new stock totaling 14
percent of the shares outstanding.
   A parallel Disney offer would pay $44 a share if management
drops its opposition and negotiates a sale.
   Polaroid management, which has sued to stop Shamrock from
increasing its 8 percent stake in the company, has characterized
the suitor's objections to the ESOP as a threat to employees.
   In the letter, Shamrock asks ``Why is polaroid's president
afraid to allow Shamrock to meet with Polaroid employees?''
   It accuses management of cutting pay 5 percent and laying off 15
percent of its U.S. workforce while establishing ``golden
parachute'' payments for top executives in event of a buyout.
   ``We intend to replace the ESOP with meaningful opportunities
for employees to participate in the future growth of Polaroid,''
the letter says, without specifying what those opportunities would
be.
   In his letter, Polaroid's Booth invited Shamrock to reveal its
plans for Shamrock's revitalization in a formal proposal.

   A senior federal judge accused defense lawyers
Tuesday of ethical misconduct in the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

stands to gain about $30 million from the sale of her stock in
Palais Royal, a Houston company going private in a deal financed by
Drexel.
   The judge said he would forward a complaint to the chief judge
of Manhattan federal court, Charles Brieant, for a possible
disciplinary hearing into how two defense lawyers, Martin
Flumenbaum and Arthur Liman, obtained the Palais Royal information.
Both attorneys denied wrongdoing.
   The judge also chastised other defense attorneys for what he
called their ethical misconduct and irresponsible behavior for
notifying him at home on Saturday, Oct. 10, of their belief he had
a conflict of interest in the case.
   ``I'd have preferred it if you'd not called me privately,''
Pollack said angrily. ``It isn't appropriate to call up a judge on
a Saturday afternoon.''
   The developments marked the angriest exchanges yet between
Pollack and the Drexel legal team fighting the Securities and
Exchange Commission's wide-ranging civil-fraud charges.
   The SEC charges, filed last month after an intense
investigation, allege Drexel, its high-yield bond chief Michael
Milken and others colluded with now-imprisoned insider trader Ivan
Boesky to violate a variety of securities laws.
   So far the Drexel case has been stalled in pretrial maneuvering
that centers on fact-gathering and whether the case should be
handled by Pollack, a highly regarded 82-year-old jurist known for
tough rulings in securities fraud cases. From the start, Drexel and
the others have sought his removal.
   In arguments Tuesday, defense attorneys claimed they only
learned about Moselle Pollack's Drexel-related business deal on
Oct. 9 and felt obligated to notify the judge promptly, as
specified under federal litigation rules on conflicts of interest.
   They said that even if the judge can rule objectively, his
wife's business deal creates the appearance of conflict.
   Barry Goldsmith, a deputy SEC litigation counsel, argued that
Moselle Pollack's financial interests in the Drexel deal are
extremely remote and indirect, because she will get $30 million for
the sale of her ownership interest whether Drexel is involved or
not.
   He also implied Drexel created the conflict by agreeing to
become involved in the Palais Royal transaction. Drexel attorneys
denied it.
   The judge did not rule Tuesday on whether he should disqualify
himself but is expected to issue a written decision in a few days.
People familiar with the case said they doubted he would surrender
the case to another judge.

   A district court shouldn't have dismissed a
$120 million lawsuit against officers and directors of the bankrupt
1984 Louisiana World Exposition, a federal appeals court said
Tuesday in remanding the case for further proceedings.
   ``It is clear that Louisiana law does, in fact, recognize that a
corporation may hold its officers and directors liable for gross
negligence, mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty, '' the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.
   The suit sought damages for contractors and other creditors who
lost money when the world's fair declared bankruptcy four days
before it closed in November 1984.
   The lawsuit was filed by a committee of creditors of the
exposition against the event's directors and officers.
   The district court threw out the case without a hearing because
state laws protected officers and directors of the bankrupt fair
from lawsuits by creditors of the event, the appeals court said in
reviewing the suit.
   The directors included fair president Petr Spurney, and other
officials of the corporation that sponsored the exhibition, such as
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who was a city councilman at the time,
City Councilman James Singleton and other former city officials.
   ``This appeal involves the interaction of Louisiana corporate
law and federal bankruptcy law. The fundamental question before us
is whether the committee can maintain an action against the
appellees ... for gross negligence, mismanagement and breach of
fiduciary duty,'' the appeals court said.
   ``In short, we have corrected the district court's mistaken
impressions as to the nature and viability of this lawsuit,'' the
appeals court said.

   Ford Motor Co. recalled about 167,000
minivans and trucks Tuesday because of possible problems in wiring
under front seats and in rear window glass.
   One of the two recalls involves about 103,000 1986 Aerostar,
Bronco II and Ranger SuperCab vehicles. The company said some
wiring under front seats may become pinched or worn, cause a short
circuit and ignite seat cushions.
   Dealers will install a new fuse and the wiring will be moved at
no charge to owners.
   In the other recall, Ford said some optional, sliding rear
windows may be defective in about 64,000 1988 model F-150, F250 and
F-350 trucks.
   Ford said the glass may not have been tempered properly and
could break into pieces larger than allowed by federal law.
Defective windows would be replaced at no charge to the owner.
   Ford spokesman Mike Parris said the company was aware of no
injuries stemming from either of the problems.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Halts Hostile Takeover Of Interco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday blocked a
hostile $2.66 billion takeover bid for Interco Inc. just hours
before the tender offer was scheduled to close.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in ruling against
Cardinal Acquisition Corp. of Washington, did not specify that
judges would hear the suit filed by Interco, which argues
Cardinal's bid was illegal. The ruling freezes the bid until a
further decision is made.
   Cardinal's $70 a share tender was scheduled to close at midnight
Tuesday. Cardinal, led by brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales, began
its takeover attempt with a bid of $64 per share in July.
   In the suit, Interco alleged Cardinal violated federal
regulations by failing to disclose a co-bidder, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Interco, a diversified furniture and apparel maker based in St.
Louis, also argued the takeover planned by Cardinal violated
federal regulations by being too highly leveraged.
   Interco spokesman David Garino said the judges had not informed
Interco of any next step in the case.
   The Rales brothers did not return a call to their Washington
office for comment.
   Interco issued a statement Tuesday afternoon urging shareholders
not to tender their shares to Cardinal and to withdraw shares
previously tendered.
   Last week, a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Missouri upheld a federal judge's decision barring
litigation in the case.
   Before the 8th Circuit ruling, Cardinal Acquisition attorneys
argued the case should be heard in Delaware, where the Rales group
is chartered and other motions had been heard. The 3rd Circuit's
jurisdiction includes Delaware.
   On Sept. 20, Interco announced that its board of directors had
rejected a revised, conditional $72-a-share offer from the Rales
group. The board said it had instead adopted a major restructuring
and recapitalization program that might include a sale of some of
its major businesses.
   Interco's products include Ethan Allen furniture, London Fog
overwear and Florsheim Shoes.
   Interco Chairman Harvey Saligman said the restructuring plan was
worth $75 per share.

and marketing, sales, research, and testing operations.
   David Burner, president of Goodrich's aerospace division, said,
``The manufacture of aircraft tires no longer fits our strategy for

   Final sale of the aircraft tire operation is contingent on

   Striking nuclear submarine builders at
Electric Boat voted Tuesday to accept a new four-year contract
almost identical to one rejected in August, ending a 103-day
walkout without achieving many of their demands.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' said Joseph Messier, president of the
10,200-member Metal Trades Council, which represents 10 trade
unions. Union members voted 3,752 to 1,822 in favor of the new pact.
   ``There's going to be a lot of animosity in the shipyard,''
Messier said.
   The agreement, reached after four days of negotiations, provides
a 3 percent pay raise in the third year of the contract and bonuses
in the other years.
   The wage and benefit package is identical in dollar value to the
one union negotiators rejected in August and refused to put to a
vote of the rank and file, a company spokesman said.
   Before walking off the job July 1, workers voted 4,921 to 3,140
to reject Electric Boat's offer of lump-sum bonuses in lieu of wage
increases. The union insisted on a three-year contract with a 5
percent raise in the first year, and 4 percent raises in each of
the next two years.
   A number of recent developments in the 14-week strike put
pressure on negotiators to get the strikers back to work, including
a finding by a National Labor Relations Board official that the
strike might be illegal because the council failed to give the
required 30 days' notice before calling the walkout.
   More than 300 union jobs, including machinists, grinders and
laborers, have been permanently lost to replacement workers or
subcontracting as a result of the three-month strike, union and
company officials said.
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., is a
builder of nuclear-powered attack submarines and the sole maker of
Trident ballistic submarines, the nation's largest.
   It had sought to limit percentage pay increases and pay bonuses
to reduce costs and remain competitve for submarine contracts with
rival Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. of Virginia.
   First-class mechanics, a classification that covers about 85
percent of Electric Boat's workers, earned $12.02 per hour under
the old contract. The new contract provides for workers to receive
as much as $2,250 in bonuses within about a month of returning to
work.

   A bank holding company with branches in 72
countries was indicted Tuesday in what federal agents described as
the first drug-related money-laundering case involving a global
banking institution.
   William Von Raab, head of the U.S. Customs Service, called it
the ``first corporate raid,'' adding ``we have given new meaning to
the term `hostile takeover.'''
   ``For some international banks, their sleaze factor is higher
than their interest rates. That's what we're talking about here,
just pure greed,'' he said.
   In a two-year undercover sting dubbed ``Operation C Chase,''
from the C in C-note or a $100 bill, Customs agents were able to
infiltrate powerful Colombian money-laundering syndicates and help
launder an estimated $32 million in drug proceeds, federal
authorities said.
   The money was intended principally for Colombian drug
traffickers, including the Medellin Cartel, Customs said.
   Indictments unsealed Tuesday named nine banking officials along
with a Luxembourg-based bank holding company, BCCI Holdings, as
well as two subsidiaries, Bank of Credit and Commerce International
S.A., which has operations in the United States and England, and
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Limited,
organized in the Cayman Islands and operating in France, the
Republic of Panama, Colombia, Bahamas and the United States.
   In addition to the indictments, the government filed civil
complaints seeking forfeiture of individuals' property and funds as
allegedly representing drug profits, and it also seeks forfeiture
of BCCI assets.
   The announcement of the indictments followed the arrest of 11
people here Sunday after they had been lured to a fictitious
wedding, which one official compared to ``a Cecil B. DeMille
production.'' Invitations were sent and seven were nabbed en route
to a bachelor party.
   A federal judge late Tuesday lifted a restraining order that had
been issued against the bank and allowed the bank to resume normal
business after BCCI put into escrow $14 million, the amount the
government alleged the bank had laundered. Before the escrow
deposit was made, the bank had been restrained from conducting all
but routine business without clearance from U.S. Marshals.
   Altogether, 85 defendants were named in indictments returned in
Tampa, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Houston.
Additionally, five other warrants were issued in Miami, Los
Angeles, London and Paris, with two in London.
   At least 40 people have been arrested around the world,
including the United States, England and Argentina, officials said.
Among those indicted was fight promoter Felix ``Tuto'' Zabala who
was ordered held without bail in Miami Tuesday on six counts of
marijuana smuggling and money-laundering.
   ``It is the first time an entire international financial
institution and its important members have been indicted,'' said
Von Raab, who appeared at a news conference here with high-ranking
customs representatives from England and France. Drug agents from
England and France participated in busting the ring.
   ``Colombian traffickers are really looking to Europe to improve
their markets,'' Von Raab said, saying cocaine prices are double
there. ``But they can't without help from financial institutions _
that's why this case is important.''
   The holding company, prosecutors said, is the world's
seventh-largest privately held financial institution. Most large
banks have publicly traded stock. While prosecutors couldn't be
reached to elaborate on the bank's size, a spokesman for the bank's
lawyers said it was an apparent reference to the geographical size
in the number of countries served.
   The trade journal American Banker said Bank of Credit and
Commerce International ranks as No. 326 among the world's biggest
banks, as measured by deposits, and No. 378 as measured by assets.
   The bank said in a news release that its officials and lawyers
had not seen the allegations and couldn't respond.
   ``The bank is wholly unaware of any violations of law that
allegedly have been committed,'' the release stated, adding that it
was confident ``the outcome will be satisfactory.''
   Beginning in July 1986, the undercover agents dealt primarily
with Gonzalo Mora Jr., who controlled a laundering network in
Medellin, Colombia, home of the Medellin Cartel, to service
traffickers John Doe, also known as ``Don Chepe,'' in that South
American city and Roberto Baez-Alcaino in Los Angeles, the
indictment said.
   Undercover agents received the money from various defendants and
laundered it for a commission, officials said. In most instances,
the money was deposited in bank accounts in Tampa, then transmitted
to Mora in Colombia via blank checks drawn on the Tampa account,
prosecutors said.
   Officials estimated that $14 million was laundered through the
BCCI subsidaries.
   According to the indictment, agents first contacted BCCI
representatives in February 1987 and began opening accounts at
various branches in July.
   Authorities said the alleged scheme operated this way: Bank
officials placed the drug money in certificates of deposit in
branches in France, Panama, Uruguay, Bahamas, Luxembourg and
England, then created a loan at another branch and allowed the
trafficers to withdraw the funds. The bank repaid the loan with
funds in the CDs, officials said.
   The indictments alleged possession and smuggling conspiracies,
as well as conspiracy to defraud the IRS, launder proceeds of
domestic cocaine sales, and engage in a continuing criminal
enterprise.

<HEAD>Eastern, Trump Reported in Deal for Shuttle</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with news conference reportedly
scheduled.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump was reported Tuesday to have
agreed to buy Eastern Airlines' Northeast air shuttle, with one
estimate putting the price at more than $350 million.
   In separate reports, the Miami News and the Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said a deal had been reached and could
be announced as early as Wednesday. The New York Times in its
Wednesday editions quoted a source that it did not identify as
saying a Wednesday morning news conference had been scheduled at
New York's Plaza Hotel to announce the deal.
   Sources had reported last week that Trump was negotiating to buy
the shuttle operation, which links New York, Boston and Washington.
Sources also reported that Carl Icahn, the financier who heads
Trans World Airlines, was discussing a possible purchase of the
struggling Eastern from its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Neither Trump, a New York developer who owns casino property in
Atlantic City, N.J., nor officials at Eastern's Miami headquarters
would comment on the latest reports.
   The News quoted an unidentified source close to Eastern as
saying Trump would pay more than $350 million.
   Dow Jones said Eastern President Phil Bakes was in New York, but
airline spokesmen declined to say why he was there.
   In recent court testimony, Eastern executives said the shuttle
was the only profitable Eastern operation.
   Texas Air, citing a billion dollars in Eastern losses over the
past decade, has said it must have labor concessions to keep the
airline going.
   Eastern made the shuttle into a separate division last year,
leading to speculation that Texas Air was considering selling it to
raise cash.
   Asked about Tuesday's reports, Norma Foerderer, spokeswoman for
the Trump Organization, said, ``I have nothing to say about this
matter at his time.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell also declined to discuss the
reports.
   Leaders of Eastern unions, who went to court to block an earlier
planned spinoff of the shuttle from Eastern to a new Texas Air
subsidiary, said they had no first-hand confirmation on the shuttle
sale but would fight it.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association local
representing Eastern pilots, said: ``ALPA's position all along has
been we would oppose the sale. We will take whatever legal means is
possible.''
   Officials of the Machinists union, which filed the suit that
derailed the spinoff of the shuttle, were reported to be in an
arbitration meeting and unavailable to comment.
   That suit stemmed from Texas Air's announcement last February
that it planned to transfer the shuttle to a new subsidiary in
return for an infusion of $225 million in cash for Eastern.
   In March, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt blocked the plan
with a contempt of court finding against Eastern.
   A federal appeals court reversed Pratt's contempt order in June,
but left the door open for the unions to mount another court
challenge. The following month, Eastern announced that the plan was
off.
   In recent weeks, reports surfaced that the shuttle again was for
sale _ this time to an outside buyer.
   Trump's desire for the shuttle became public knowledge last
week, and then Icahn was reported to be interested in buying all of
Eastern. Union sources said that they had met with Icahn, and there
was speculation Icahn would make an offer for Eastern only if the
unions agreed to concessions in their pay and work rules.
   The Miami Herald reported Tuesday morning that Eastern's unions
were continuing talks with Icahn. The Herald, quoting unidentified
sources, said Icahn wanted the pilots union to accept 15 percent
paycuts while the pilots offered to freeze their salaries at
present levels until 1992.
   Cole, the pilots spokesman, declined comment on the Herald's
report.

<HEAD>$1.6 Billion German Bank Credit For Soviets To Be Signed Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consortium of West German banks
next week plans to sign a $1.6 billion credit agreement for the
Soviet Union, reportedly the biggest Western credit line ever to
the Soviet Union, according to financial sources.
   Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest commercial bank, is
heading the consortium involved in the agreement.
   The Duesseldorf-based financial newspaper Handelsblatt said
Monday that the agreement would be signed on Oct. 17.
   When contacted by the Associated Press by telephone, Deutsche
Bank spokesman Hans Detmar said: ``I can confirm that the signing
will take place on Monday.'' Detmar provided no further details.
   Other banking sources, requesting anonymity, said the agreement
would be signed at an undisclosed location in Frankfurt.
   Deutsche Bank announced in May that it was heading a consortium
of banks to extend the credit to the Soviets to boost the communist
nation's consumer goods production and delivery.
   Handelsblatt on Monday said the agreement will be finalized with
another signing ceremony scheduled for Oct. 24 in Moscow, when
Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrives in the Soviet capital for an
official visit.
   Soviet officials hope to use the money to improve the Soviet
Union's food processing and consumer goods industries, a top
priority of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, according to the
New York Times.
   The credit line arranged with Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic
Affairs is to have an 8{-year life, with interest rates to be set
as individual projects are arranged.
   German banks traditionally have been a leading Western lender to
the Soviet Union, trailing only the Japanese. Of the roughly $16
billion lent to the Soviets since 1984, 40 percent came from
Japanese banks and 30 percent from German banks, the Times stated.
   U.S. banks accounted for only about 2 percent of the other new
lending to the Soviets.

   Share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while the U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in
Wednesday morning trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 211.33-point winner Tuesday, was down 212.69
points at 27,256.91 by the end of Wednesday morning trading.
   Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities said many investors stayed
on the sidelines for a variety of reasons, including the precarious
health of Japan's Emperor Hirohito and the upcoming release of new
U.S. trade figures.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to release monthly
trade figures for August on Thursday in Washington.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 131.12 yen, down from
Tuesday's close of 131.15 yen, and drifted higher during the
session. The dollar was trading at 131.20 yen by midmorning.
   Foreign exchange dealers said uneasiness over the trade figures
also pushed the dollar down, but compared to Tuesday the pressure
was lower. On Tuesday, the dollar had fallen 2.35 yen for its
lowest closing since mid-July.
   Market sentiment shows investors expect the U.S. trade figures
to widen from the previous month, a dealer with a major commercial
bank said.
