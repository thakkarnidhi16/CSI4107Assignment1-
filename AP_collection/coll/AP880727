   Chicago attorney Richard J. Phelan, named Tuesday
to investigate the ethical conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright, has
raised money for Democratic Sen. Paul Simon and was elected a
delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   But some of Phelan's associates took issue with Republican
claims that the Chicago lawyer is a Democratic activist who
couldn't impartially investigate Wright, also a Democrat.
   Although he was a delegate to the Democratic convention last
week, Phelan decided not to go.
   Phelan, 51, was elected as a delegate pledged to the failed
presidential bid of Simon, D-Ill., but resigned before the
convention, said Simon spokeswoman Terry Stephan.
   Ms. Stephan did not indicate why Phelan, who had served as a
Simon fund-raiser, had resigned.
   Phelan's selection Tuesday drew criticism from Citizens for
Reagan, which sent a Mailgram message to the House Ethics committee
saying, ``The appointment of liberal Democrat activist Richard
Phelan as outside counsel in the Wright case certainly calls into
question the independence of the ethics committee inquiry.''
   But Amy Zisook of Chicago, Simon's national finance director,
took issue with characterizing Phelan as an ``activist.''
   ``I assume he's been active locally, but I've been involved in
Democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this
year was the first time I ever met Mr. Phelan,'' Ms. Zisook said.
   Phelan is a 1958 graduate of the University of Notre Dame, and
received his law degree from Georgetown University in 1961, the
same year he was admitted to the Illinois bar.
   He is the author of numerous articles on litigation and was
president of the Chicago Bar Association in 1985-86.
   Last year, Phelan successfully defended Jewel Companies Inc., in
a lawsuit in which attorneys sought $100 million in punitive
damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nation's largest
outbreak of salmonella.
   The outbreak in 1985 had been traced to milk from a Jewel dairy
in suburban Chicago. The company ended up compensating those who
fell ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive
damages.
   Attorneys at Phelan's firm said the case was the largest
personal injury product liability class action yet settled.
   Phelan also defended the city of Chicago in a case brought by a
black patrolmen's association which contended the police force had
discriminated against black officers.
   Phelan and his wife, Carol, an architect, have three children.
They live in a northern Chicago suburb.
   House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., said
Democratic and Republican members of the evenly divided 12-member
panel had agreed on Phelan's selection.
   Members of both parties were satisified that he could do an
impartial job, Dixon said.
   The contract with Phelan's Chicago firm, Phelan, Pope & John,
Ltd., will be for no more than $300,000, he said. Dixon said he
could not estimate how long the investigation would take.

   Partial train service was restored
Wednesday as striking locomotive drivers began returning to work
after police arrested hundreds of strikers and supporters.
   Hundreds of locomotive drivers and assistants demanding higher
pay and shorter hours walked off the job Tuesday after refusing to
accept a compromise deal on allowances and working hours.
   The Korean National Railroad said services were operating at
about 30 percent of normal levels after being virtually crippled
Tuesday. Railroad officials said they hoped to restore almost full
service by Thursday as strikers returned to work.
   Surburban train service around Seoul, which was affected by the
strike, was back to normal early Wednesday, railroad officials said.
   Police officials, who declined to be named, said 420 people were
still being held Wednesday after about 1,460 striking drivers and
members of their families were arrested the day before for blocking
stations and other railroad facilities. The others had been
released with reprimands, police said.
   Of the ramaining 420 still in custody, officials said about 20
were strike leaders facing charges of conducting an illegal strike.
The others would probably be handed over to summary courts to face
minor charges, they said.
   The government moved to crush the strike and thousands of riot
police were sent to stations and railway yards to stop peaceful
protests by the strikers and their families. The Cabinet held an
emergency session Tuesday to oversee handling of the affair.
   Those arrested defied police orders to disperse, but there were
no reports of violent clashes, police said.
   Railroad officials said strikers were returning to work, but
they had no overall figures on how many of the some 4,400 drivers
and assistants had joined the strike. They said they expect most
strikers to resume work Wednesday.
   But reports in Seoul newspapers Wednesday said some strikers
said they would not return to work until all strikers arrested by
police had been freed.
   The officials said the strike cost the KNR an estimated $2.5
million Tuesday alone and that there was no estimate yet as to
losses suffered by other industries.
   Choi Ki-duk, head of the railroad authority, said the strike was
illegal because it had not been approved by the railroad union.
   Strikers said a compromise deal worked out by the union failed
to satisfy demands for shorter work hours and a 100 percent raise
in allowances paid on top of normal salaries.
   Under the rejected deal, the railroad would raise allowances
from about $100 to $138 a month and cut workloads from 245 hours to
224 hours a month. The strikers wanted work hours cut to 144 hours.
   South Korea's train drivers with about 10 years's expereince
earn about $1,200 a month in regular salary and various allowances,
which include overtime, holiday allowance, locomotive drivers
allowance, according to the railroad.

<HEAD>Democratic Convention a Turn-Off for Networks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic National Convention would have
been a big ratings hit last week if only one network had showed up.
With three sharing the coverage, however, the convention drove
millions of viewers to other channels.
   The three-network share of the viewing audience fell to 49
percent in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last week, meaning that
fewer than half the sets in use during prime time were tuned to a
network. That compares to a 68 percent share for the three networks
this season.
   During convention week in 1984, the three-network share was 54
percent, according to Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for
research, who said last week's share was the worst ever for the
networks.
   During the four days of the convention in Atlanta, the networks'
prime-time share this year was 40 percent. Jaffe estimated that
perhaps another 1 percent of the audience was watching the
convention on Cable News Network.
   The best finish for campaign coverage was 26th for NBC on
Tuesday night, with a rating of 8.7, while ABC had the low on
Monday night with a 5.7 for 52nd place.
   However, the three-network total for Tuesday night's coverage
was a rating of 23.2, compared with 15.6 for ``Golden Girls,'' the
week's top-rated show. Cumulative totals for the other nights were
20.1 for Monday, 20.1 for Wednesday and 21.1 on Thursday.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   Because of the lack of suspense at this year's Democratic
Convention and the expectation that the Republican National
Convention also will be largely a scripted media event, ABC News
President Roone Arledge has said his network might pare its
coverage of the GOP gathering.
   The two other networks have said they will give the GOP as much
time as the Democrats got.
   NBC had the biggest convention audience with a 7.4 average
rating for the four nights. Jaffe said NBC was the only network to
have better convention ratings than in 1984. ABC was second with
6.9 and CBS was third with 6.5.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 9.4, more than a
third less than its season average. CBS was second at 7.9 and ABC
had 7.8.
   For the 44 weeks of the season, NBC leads with an average
prime-time rating of 15.0, followed by CBS at 12.6 and ABC at 12.5.
   News ratings also were down last week. CBS was the winner with
an 8.6 rating, half a point lower than its winning number a week
earlier. ABC was second at 8.6, down 0.6, and NBC was in third at
7.8, down 0.9.
   NBC's reruns again dominated the week. Here is the top 10:
``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Hunter'' (tie),
both NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Deliberate Stranger'' part 1, the
NBC Sunday Night Movie; ``Murder She Wrote,'' CBS; ``Amen,'' NBC;
``Sin of Innocence,'' the ``CBS Sunday Movie,'' and ABC's ``20-20''
(tie); ``Alf,'' NBC.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of an ultralight
airplane was killed after his craft apparently struck a West German
Tornado jet fighter in flight and crashed, police said.
   Police said a preliminary investigation indicated the light
plane nicked the fighter before Tuesday's crash. But officials did
not rule out the possibility that turbulence from the jet's engine
sent the ultralight down.
   The dead pilot was not identified.
   The crash occurred near Eggenfelden, about 60 miles east of
Munich.
   The jet was not damaged and returned to its base near Munich,
officials said.
   Police did not say whether the Tornado was on a low-level
training flight.
   A series of NATO warplane crashes in West Germany in recent
weeks has resulted in a growing demand that low-level military
training flights be banned or sharply reduced.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to modernize industry
and trim fat from management forced nearly 1 million Soviet factory
workers out of work in the first half of the year, Radio Moscow
reported.
   But those laid off are sure to get other jobs ``since the
government has undertaken to redistribute the labor force in a
planned manner,'' the state-run radio said Tuesday.
   Gorbachev, named Communist Party chief in March 1985, has waged
a campaign to reform the country's economy, increase productivity
and prune the size of the state bureaucracy.
   In January, the Communist Party daily Pravda estimated that 16
million Soviets would be laid off in the next 12 years as
efficiency increases.
   Radio Moscow said: ``The number of workers in Soviet industries
has gone down by almost 1 million in the first half of the year,
compared with the same period last year.''
   ``The national statistical service attributes the fact to the
current economic reform, which is introducing more automatic
systems and streamlining management,'' the radio said.
   Radio Moscow did not provide the size of the labor force in the
country's factories last year or today.
   In 1986, 82.1 million of the Soviet Union's 276 million citizens
were officially classified as ``workers,'' as distinguished from
white-collar service or management personnel and collective farmers.

   Hall played the starring role of Cherie, a woman who is stranded
at a bus stop with a cowboy who abducted her.
   About 850 people attended Tuesday night's performance that
started a two-week run for the play at Montclair State College.
   Singer Neil Young accompanied Jagger. Both remained backstage
until the lights dimmed for the opening act.
   Some in the audience tried to get the autographs of Jagger and
Young but were blocked by bodyguards.
   The audience appeared to enjoy the show throughout and applauded
loudly at ts end.
   Jagger, Young and the bodyguards left immediately after the show

   ``Wheel of Fortune'' letter-turner Vanna
White says mystery spells success and has turned down an offer to
be host of the daytime version of the show when Pat Sajak leaves.
   ``I think America likes what I do,'' White said Monday. ``I'm a
mystery to people. They want to know more.''
   The show's producer says she discussed the idea of White taking
over as host, but White, 31, says she doesn't want a bigger role.
   ``I think the fact that I don't do more has made me what I am,''
said White, whose largely non-speaking role on the popular game
show turned her into a star.
   Sajak will remain as host of the nighttime version, the nation's

version at the end of the year to be host of a late night talk show.

ruling the tiny, 62-square-mile principality of Liechtenstein.
   Parliament honored the 81-year-old monarch with a special

   Franz Josef is the second-longest ruling head of state in the

   The estranged wife of Washington Redskins
owner Jack Kent Cooke says she was stunned to learn that comments
she made during an intimate conversation with biographer Kitty
Kelly were published in a magazine.
   August's issue of Washingtonian magazine offers a revealing
account of the Cookes' tumultuous marriage based on two interviews
between Miss Kelly and Suzanne Cooke. The interviews were conducted
two years apart.
   Among the revelations is Mrs. Cooke's account of her two
abortions after getting pregnant by Cooke, and how the billionaire
football team owner only agreed to marry her on condition that she
end a third pregnancy by him.
   Mrs. Cooke, 31, never got the third abortion and is the mother
of Jacqueline Kent Cooke, born Jan. 25. Cooke, 76, has never seen
the baby.
   Mrs. Cooke said Tuesday she objects to the use of the intimate
details she gave Miss Kelly in 1986.
   ``I was stunned by the quotations that were printed from the
early interviews,'' Mrs. Cooke said. But Miss Kelly said that Mrs.
Cooke knew during both interviews that she was being taped.
   Mrs. Cooke said her marriage to Cooke is over and has sued him
for $15 million for a trust fund for her daughter.

   The colorization process has drawn fire from such Hollywood

   On an evening in 1856, Rep. Philemon T.
Herbert of California, one of the more obscure members of the
House, was waiting for service in the dining room of the capital's
preeminent hotel, The Willard.
   Growing hungrier _ and angrier _ by the minute, he was
resolutely ignored by a haughty waiter.
   According to a new history of the House of Representatives,
``Losing his patience, and perhaps feeling the snub more acutely
than he had a right to do, Herbert pulled his pistol and shot and
killed the man.''
   Herbert's rather extreme reaction to this unacceptable affront
to his congressional dignity is recounted by House historian James
T. Currie, who adds: ``The House did not censure Rep. Herbert for
his act, thereby giving a certain justification to it.''
   This was, perhaps, not a high moment in the history of the House
or of its members.
   But Washington waiters ever since have been closely observant of
the needs of hungry House and Senate members.
   The temper tantrum of the ignored congressman and its fatal
result is but a minor low point in a new volume sketching the
199-year history of the House, most of which is devoted to far more
consequential affairs of state.
   Currie's work, and a companion history of the Senate by its
official historian, Richard Baker, have been issued to mark next
year's celebration of the bicentennial of the Congress.
   They set out the milestones of the nation's legislative history,
with an occasional side look at some of the more unusual, and
eccentric, people and events along the way.
   For the most part, Baker's history of the Senate ignores the
existence of the House. Currie's history of the House mostly
ignores the history of the Senate.
   But not entirely.
   At the very beginning, the House historian notes, the Senate
proposed that the nation's president be addressed as ``His
Highness, President of the United States and Protector of the
Rights of the Same.''
   Currie calls this ``an awful appellation'' and records that the
House would have none of it.
   The president has been ``Mr. President'' ever since.
   Baker recalls how Alexis DeTocqueville, the French observer of
American institutions, was struck in 1831 by the ``vulgar
demeanor'' of the popularly elected House compared to the Senate,
whose members were elected by state legislatures.
   The Senate, said De Tocqueville, ``is composed of eloquent
advocates, distinguished generals, wise magistrates and statesmen
of note, whose arguments would do honor to the most remarkable
parliamentary debates in Europe.''
   The House, he sniffed, was composed of men of far lower
qualifications and standing in society. ``In a country in which
education is very general, it is said that the representatives of
the people do not always know how to write correctly.''
   In fairness, Baker notes that Sen. Thomas Hart Benton took
exception to this, branding DeTocqueville and his opinions as
``elitist.''
   ``The Missouri senator observed that most senators had
originally been House members.''
   Currie notes that Thomas Jefferson is said to have asked George
Washington why the Constitutional Convention had created a
two-house legislature.
   Why wasn't one house enough?
   ``Why did you pour your tea into that saucer? asked Washington.
``To cool it,'' replied Jefferson. ``Just so,'' responded
Washington. ``We pour House legislation into the senatorial saucer
to cool it.''
   Currie notes that 200 years after that purported discussion, the
situation is at times reversed.
   ``The House has begun to act as a check on the Senate,'' he
concludes. ``It has now become in many instances the saucer into
which Senate legislation is poured to cool it.''
   The two volumes lay out the benchmarks of congressional history,
high and low, triumph and scandal: The burning of the Capitol by
the British in 1814, the expansion of the nation, the march toward
Civil War in the 1860s, the end of slavery, the era of
reconstruction, the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson,
investigations, the rivalry with the presidency, the depression,
world wars, the ethics of congressmen, Watergate. ...
   Says historian Baker of his volume: ``It's a hop, skip and a
jump over the mountain tops.''

<HEAD>Americans Eating Their Way to Early Graves, Surgeon General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are eating their way to early
graves, bite by bite and meal by meal, consuming too much fat,
seasoning it with too much salt and washing it down with too much
alcohol, according to a report issued today by the U.S. surgeon
general.
   ``Overconsumption of certain dietary components is now a major
concern for Americans,'' the report said, noting that ``diseases of
dietary excess and imbalance'' are among the leading causes of
death in the United States.
   Many Americans are overweight, don't eat enough fruit,
vegetables and whole grains, and often fail to get required
nutrients such as calcium and iron.
   Of the 2.1 million Americans who died last year, the surgeon
general's study said that nearly 1.5 million succumbed to diseases
associated with diet.
   ``What we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading
causes of death for Americans, notably, coronary heart disease,
stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and some types of cancer,'' the
report said. ``These disorders together now account for more than
two-thirds of all deaths in the United States.''
   Though malnutrition is a problem in several parts of the world
and for certain Americans, the report said, ``for most of us the
more likely problem has become one of overeating _ too many
calories for our activity levels and an imbalance in the nutrients
consumed along with them.''
   In a forward to the report, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said
that although many foods are involved, the chief factor affecting
health ``is the disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats,
often at the expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and
fiber _ such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products.''
   He said he is convinced that through ``a concerted effort'' by
policy makers and the public, ``our daily diets can bring a
substantial measure of better health to all Americans.''
   The 712-page report cites more than 2,000 scientific studies
from around the world and was compiled with the advice of more than
200 doctors, nutritionists and biochemists.
   The report makes recommendations ranging from the amount of fat
that should be included in the diet, to the advisability of taking
vitamin supplements.
   Among the major findings:
   _Most people should reduce the consumption of fat, especially
saturated fats, such as from eggs, butter or untrimmed red meat. It
suggests more vegetables and fruits, fish, poultry, lean meats and
low-fat dairy products.
   _More whole grain foods, cereal products, vegetables and fruits
should be in the diet. The report recommends that dried beans and
peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products.
   _Sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of
salt in food preparation and at the table.
   _Alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day ``if at
all.'' Pregnant women should avoid any alcohol, it said. The report
estimates that about 9 percent of the American population has two
or more drinks a day.
   _Fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent
tooth decay, and that the consumption of sugar be limited to avoid
dental cavities.
   _Adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods
high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products.
   _Children, adolescents and women of childbearing age should
consume more iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, cereals,
beans and whole-grain cereals. ``This issue is of special concern
for low-income families,'' the report said.
   Dietary fat, the report said, increases risks for obesity, some
types of cancer, gallbladder and heart disease.
   ``Dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy
intake of Americans, well above the upper limit of 30 percent
recommended by the American Heart Association and the American
Cancer Society,'' the report said.
   It said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with
heart attacks, should be reduced by limiting consumption of foods
of animal origin, such as eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry and
fish.
   The report warned against fad diets or ``magical'' foods that
often are promoted with unsubstantiated claims. It said Americans
spend about $2.7 billion a year for nutritional supplements that
are ``of unproven benefit.''
   Over-the-counter vitamins and minerals, alone, represent a huge
business of questionable value, the report said.
   ``An estimated 40 percent of Americans consume supplemental
vitamins, minerals, or other dietary components at an annual cost
of more than $1.5 billion,'' even though such supplements are not
needed by most customers, the report said.
   Americans also spend extra money for products labeled as
``natural'' or ``organic'', even though the study said special
benefits of these products ``are not generally demonstrated.''
   ```Natural' vitamins, for example, often sell at twice the price
of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical,''
the report said. ``In some such products labeled as `natural', only
a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural
sources.''

<HEAD>Boon for Dairymen Tacked Onto Drought Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a $145 million milk price support
increase tacked onto the House drought-relief bill say it could
invite a presidential veto, but the amendment's chief sponsor says
it's needed because ``cows don't drop from the sky.''
   Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., says that without the 50-cent price
support increase, dairy farmers in his state and elsewhere will
reduce the size of their herds, eventually leading to milk
shortages.
   Critics produced two studies saying the chances of such
shortages are slight, but the House Agriculture Committee approved
the milk price-support increase anyway on a 15-12 vote and then
sent the drought-relief bill to the full House.
   ``This amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable,'' said
Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. He said the amendment makes the measure
subject to criticism that it treats ``one segment of agriculture
more favorably than other segments of agriculture.''
   The committee action also came despite a warning from President
Reagan against special benefits for favored segments of agriculture.
   ``Creating windfalls for some will mean less for the truly
deserving,'' Reagan said in a letter sent Monday to House
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas.
   ``To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' Reagan
said.
   As the bill was written two weeks ago, it would have canceled an
expected price-support cut of 50 cents for each hundred pounds of
milk. The new plan adopted at Jeffords' urging would not only
cancel the reduction but would increase the price-support level by
50 cents per hundredweight to $11.10.
   ``It is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an
adequate supply of milk,'' said Jeffords, whose home state is a
major source of the East Coast's milk.
   He said that without additional help, dairy farmers will reduce
their herds and the lost production capability could not be
restored overnight.
   ``Cows don't drop from the sky,'' Jeffords said. He said that if
milk shortages set in, ``you're going to hear screams from
consumers that you won't believe.''
   Rep. Jim Olin, D-Va., presented one study by the Agriculture
Department and another by private agricultural economists that saw
no milk shortage in the offing if the system remains as it is.
   Proponents of the measure, however, shrugged off such studies.
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said that because of the drought a
50-cent increase in the price-support level actually is in keeping
philosophically with the 1985 farm program, even though it calls
for successive 50-cent cuts in supports.
   Steinholm said higher feed prices, caused by a hay shortage,
have been tantamount to a drastic cut in price supports, and that
fairness would actually call for a $1 increase in supports.
   At the outset of the committee's session, Deputy Agriculture
Secretary Peter Myers told lawmakers the administration already
disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand feed
programs for dairy and livestock producers.
   He also said the administration opposes a provision that would
require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two years
as a condition of receiving disaster payments now.
   The measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all
crops equal to 65 percent of losses in excess of 35 percent of
expected yield.
   For farmers who lost their entire crops, there would be
additional payments.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee already has approved its own
version of the bill but is struggling to come up with a similar
plan to aid farmers whose crops have been all but entirely burned
away by the blazing sun and shortage of rainfall that has plagued
the midcontinent.
   Farm senators had planned to meet late Tuesday to work out a
formula but canceled the session at the last minute. They still are
aiming for floor action this week.
   Feed benefits for livestock producers would be capped at $50,000
for each individual. Payments for crop producers would be limited
to $100,000 per person.
   As it was putting the finishing touches on the bill, the House
Committee demonstrated compassion for cotton growers in the
district of Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, whose crops were damaged
last year by hail. The panel approved a $24 million amendment that
would provide disaster payments to those farmers.
   Proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with
the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill
in 1986 but none in 1987. They said Combest's plan would ``fill in
the gaps.''

<HEAD>Drought To Have Long-Term Effect On Livestock Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This summer's heat and drought have hurt
livestock producers now and for some time in the future, an
Agriculture Department analysis says.
   Meat production in the second half of 1988 will be greater than
it otherwise would have been without the drought. And prices
received by livestock producers will be down, reflecting the
thinning out of herds.
   ``As producers sell off some breeding stock, the long-term
capacity of the industry will be lowered,'' the report said. ``The
increased slaughter in 1988 will lower production in 1989 and
prices will rise again.''
   The report was prepared by John Ginzel and Richard Stillman of
the department's Economic Research Service. It was included in a
forthcoming issue of Agriculture Outlook magazine.
   Beef production will be affected by this year's drought in two
ways, the report said.
   First, cattle feedlot operators, who depend on corn and other
feed grains, are seeing higher production costs. Second, cow-calf
operators, who provide calves to feeders, will be hit the hardest.
   ``Calves are the major cost in the cattle feeding industry,''
the report said. ``As the price of feed rises, cattle feedlot
operators will decrease the price they are willing to pay for
feeder cattle.''
   Meanwhile, the cow-calf producer's major feed is forage such as
pasture and hay. Drought has reduced the forage supply, just as it
has the grain inventory. As production of forage is reduced,
cow-calf operators are forced to reduce their herds or supplement
grazing with hay.
   ``The first cattle to move off drought-stressed pasture usually
are the yearling cattle that normally go into feedlots,'' the
report said. ``The next to move are replacement heifers, which were
intended to go into the breeding herd, and older, less-productive
cows.''
   Finally, the last to go are the mature, most productive cows,
the basic breeding stock for future beef production.
   Drought affects hog producers mostly through higher feed costs,
the report said. Many hog farmers produce some or all of their feed
grains. But as corn yields are reduced, producers will have to buy
additional grain or send their hogs to slaughter early.
   ``Increased culling of the (hog) breeding herd boost short-term
production and reduces prices received,'' the report said. ``It
will also reduce production in 1989. Feeder pig producers are
squeezed more than farrow-to-finish hog farmers, much like the
cow-calf producers in the beef industry.''
   Drought has hit the poultry industry in similar ways, with
higher grain and soybean meal prices raising production costs.
Broiler production may drop in the second half of 1988 and in 1989,
relative to normal output.
   ``Because broilers have a short production cycle, the broiler
industry can respond more quickly to the higher feed costs and can
decrease production more quickly than either the cattle or hog
industries,'' the report said.
   It added: ``As with previous droughts, if next year's grain and
forage crops are near normal and if grain prices drop and livestock
prices soar because production is down, meat production will then
become further depressed as profitability improves and as producers
hold animals from slaughter to rebuild their breeding herds.''

   The Agriculture Department has scheduled a
referendum among hog producers and importers to determine whether a
national pork promotion and research program will continue.
   The vote will be held Sept. 7-8 at county extension offices, J.
Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, announced Tuesday.
   ``All pork producers or persons importing hogs, pork or pork
products between Nov. 1, 1986, and Sept. 6, 1988, will be entitled
to vote in the referendum,'' Boyle said. ``A simple majority (one
vote more than half the number cast) will determine if the ...
program will continue.''
   The 1985 farm law authorized the pork program, which is paid for
by an assessment of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of
all hogs sold in the United States, and an equivalent amount on
imported hogs, pork and pork products.
   A final regulation setting up the program was issued by USDA on
Sept. 5, 1986, and the assessments began that fall on Nov. 1.
Congress stipulated that for the program to continue in effect a
referendum must be held between 24 months and 30 months after the
department issued the final regulation.

   Rains have ``relieved drought stress'' in
parts of the Corn Belt, but crops have shown little improvement,
reports the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``The precipitation gave most crops a boost in the central and
southern Great Plains, Delta and Southeast,'' the report said
Tuesday. ``Soil moisture improved but was still mostly short in the
eastern half of the nation.''
   In the central and eastern Corn Belt, rain during the week of
July 18-24 may have come too late to improve corn harvest
prospects, the report said.
   Soybeans were reported in ``mostly fair'' condition but showed
little improvement as a result of rain in the central and eastern
Corn Belt areas, the report said. However, soybeans continued to
improve in the Great Plains, where the crop was reported in ``good
to fair'' shape.
   Livestock was reported in ``mostly fair'' condition and recent
rains have helped pastures, although forage was still in short
supply.
   The facility is operated jointly by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Agriculture Department.

<HEAD>Outside Counsel To Look Into Matters In Ethics Panel Complaint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House ethics committee
says a new outside counsel named to probe allegations against House
Speaker Jim Wright will be ``free to investigate in any manner he
deems appropriate.''
   But the counsel, Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan, will be
restricted to looking into the six counts in a complaint adopted by
the panel on June 9 and public release of any findings will be
controlled by the ethics panel, said chairman Julian C. Dixon,
D-Calif.
   ``If any other evidence comes to his attention, he is directed
to report that to us,'' Dixon said in an interview Tuesday. The
committee would then decide whether to broaden the investigation,
he added.
   Dixon said he expects Phelan and his staff will do independent
investigative work, including the taking of large numbers of
depositions. The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, will pay Phelan's law firm up to
$300,000 plus expenses, he said.
   ``He is free to investigate in any manner he deems appropriate,
whatever he feels is necessary,'' said Dixon.
   ``I'm like any other professional lawyer,'' Phelan told
reporters in a brief introduction outside the closed door of the
committee room. ``I'm going to exercise my own judgment within the
parameters of the inquiry. ... I've been told to investigate the
allegations fully, fairly, completely and thoroughly, and that's
what I intend to do.''
   Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., complained
about the selection of Phelan, noting that he has been an active
Democratic fund-raiser in Chicago and had been a delegate to last
week's Democratic National Convention, although he sat out the
convention and let an alternate take his place.
   Gingrich said he also would have preferred selection of someone
with a prosecutorial background. Phelan's 60-lawyer firm handles
mostly corporate law and civil litigation.
   ``It seems to me for this investigation to have any legitimacy
it has to be able to follow the leads wherever they lead,''
Gingrich told reporters. ``The independent counsel has to be truly
independent. He cannot be on a short leash held by the Democratic
chairman of the committee.''
   Dixon said the 12-member ethics panel, made up of six Democrats
and six Republicans, agreed to seek an outside counsel at the same
time it opened its Wright inquiry on June 9, but chose not to make
that decision public until someone was found to take the job.
   ``We believed the American public would feel more comfortable,
when the speaker of the House of Representatives is being
investigated, with someone that is not an employee of the
Capitol,'' he said.
   Wright repeated to reporters his contention that he would be
exonerated by the probe and said he hoped it would be conducted
quickly. ``I think they will conclude I have not violated any
commonly accepted ethics rules, and the sooner that happens, the
better,'' Wright said.
   But Wright said the matter is being used as a political weapon
by Gingrich, who is laying the groundwork to cry foul if the probe
turns up nothing critical of the speaker.
   ``Failing to have any substance on which to rely, they are
trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear
bill of health is somehow a whitewash,'' Wright said.
   At the same time, Vice President George Bush, who has used
Wright's ethics problems as grist on the campaign trail, was
speaking across the street from the Capitol at the Library of
Congress and advocating conflict-of-interest laws for Congress that
are as tough as those that now apply to the executive branch,
including provisions for a fully independent counsel to investigate
ethics cases.
   The six counts now pending against Wright include charges of
using his office to lobby federal officials and others on matters
in which he had a financial interest, and alleged improprieties in
the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which Wright
received unusually high royalties, among other charges.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire-spitting helicopters
were dispatched to Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday to help
protect the Old Faithful geyser area from a 6,000-acre blaze, part
of the worst series of fires in the park in nearly a century.
   Almost 1,000 firefighters were summoned to the scene, but
officials had not decided as of early Tuesday evening whether to
actively fight the fire, one of a dozen burning in the oldest
national park.
   The fires have charred more than 70,000 acres in the 2.2
million-acre park, the nation's oldest national park. One fire, the
47,000-acre blaze dubbed ``Clover Mist'' on the eastern edge of
Yellowstone, made two jumps into Shoshone National Forest.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel made plans to tour Yellowstone
by helicopter Wednesday to get a first-hand view of the devastation.
   Winds were pushing the Old Faithful fire away from the geyser
complex, which includes an historic inn and several other
buildings. But fire managers decided as a safeguard to call in
``heli-torches'' that can spew a napalm-like substance. If
officials decide to use them, the copters will be used to start
``backfires'' to burn away brush in the main fire's path.
   The fire, which started Friday in the adjacent Targhee National
Forest in Idaho, burned roughly 10 miles west of Old Faithful, and
about 10-15 miles south of Madison Junction, said Fire Information
Officer Bruce Fox.
   Later estimated differed on how far the fire was from Old
Faithful, ranging from about 6 miles to 10 miles, but officials
agreed that it was still burning toward the northeast, a direction
would bypass the geyser. Spokesmen stressed that their figures on
total acreage burned also were estimates.
   Officials said they didn't believe firefighters could ever douse
the flames. ``These fires are going to burn until the weather puts
them out,'' said Fox.
   A fire camp was established 13 miles north of Old Faithful in an
open field, where resting firefighters relaxed in tents or simply
stretched out on the ground.
   Other firefighters were at Old Faithful picking the area clean
of downed trees, piles of firewood, twigs and pine needles that
could feed embers carried by winds to the area. They also cleared
the ground around a microwave tower that provides Old Faithful's
communications with the rest of the park.
   Plans were made to burn a five-mile-long meadow, possibly on
Wednesday, to clear out the dry vegetation and thus slow the fire
if it turned toward Old Faithful, said Fox.
   ``With the worst-case weather scenario (strong winds out of the
west), that probably wouldn't hold it. But it would definitely slow
it down,'' he said. ``If all else fails, we'll backfire Old
Faithful.''
   Eighty firefighters were sent to an area near Frost Lake,
located 10 miles north of Yellowstone's East Entrance, where flames
had blackened about 200 acres since the fire moved into the
national forest during the weekend, said forest spokesman Dave
Damron.
   Another 60 were 10 miles farther to the north where the ``Canoe
Lake'' fire had burned about 50 acres, he said.
   Unusually hot and dry conditions this summer have left
Yellowstone and the rest of northwestern Wyoming tinder-box dry.
   ``The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the
late 1800s,'' said Incident Commander Larry Caplinger. ``The fuel
conditions, and the weather conditions, lend themselves to extreme
fire potential.
   ``The outlook is we probably got at least three long months of
fire season ahead of us in this part of the country,'' he added.
``We could be in for the beginning of the siege of '88.''
   Although no closures of services or accommodations at Old
Faithful had been ordered, park visitors were advised such closures
may eventually be necessary. Fires have forced the closure of Grant
Village and the road from there south to the South Entrance.
   At Grant Village, about 500 firefighters were continuing to
fight flames from the the Shoshone and Red fires that had spread to
20,200 acres. The village includes a small hotel and some trailers
and apartments for park service personnel.
   Hot embers shooting ahead of the fires Monday night burned
through power lines at the area of the village and set one building
on fire. Officials said the structure wasn't seriously damaged.
   Flames also had burned around the Lewis Lake campground,
torching trees along the perimeter of the area, according to fire
officials.
   In the Teton Wilderness that borders Yellowstone on the south,
some 690 firefighters worked Tuesday along the northern edge of the
24,400-acre Mink Creek fire.
   While good progress was made during the day on the southern end
of the fire, thunderstorms packing some erratic winds were creating
a problem on the northern end, which had burned about 1,200 acres
into Yellowstone's remote backcountry.

<HEAD>Forest Lands Being `Loved To Death' By Campers, Forest Service
Says</HEAD>

   Americans looking for a pristine wilderness
experience on remote U.S. Forest Service lands increasingly are
finding trashy campsites, unsafe trails, unhealthy water and
pollution.
   And forest service officials recounting these problems also are
warning that because of tight money and growing land use,
conditions are likely to worsen among the 32 million acres of
official wilderness under their control.
   ``We're falling behind,'' George Leonard, associate USFS chief,
told the House Interior public lands subcommittee on Tuesday in
what chairman Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said was the first-ever
congressional review of the condition of wilderness areas protected
from development under a landmark 1964 law.
   ``Wilderness areas are now literally being loved to death'' by
burgeoning numbes of backpackers, some of them ignorant of
backcountry etiquette and hygiene, said Greg Hansen, a ranger from
the Superstition Wilderness in Arizona's Tonto National Forest.
   Richard LaBorde, supervisor for two areas in California's Inyo
National Forest, said that overuse there has been countered by
setting trailhead quotas and requiring campers to obtain permits.
   But he said the areas' two rangers are able to contact only 7
percent of the visitors to brief them on backcountry manners and
that trail reconstruction is eight years behind schedule, causing
safety and erosion problems.
   LaBorde said all visitors are told to purify water before
drinking it. And to combat improper sanitation practices by
campers, there are now two solar toilets on the popular Mt. Whitney
trail, he said.
   Anne Fege of the Forest Service explains that such toilets are
portable enclosures that have solar collectors to generate heat to
dry out and compost human waste.
   LaBorde said grazing by pack animals owned by commercial
outfitters is nearing the land's grazing capacity and that
concentrated use of some campsites ``has left many barren scars on
the landscape.''
   ``Our efforts to regain some sort of natural condition to these
areas have been weak,'' testified LaBorde, adding that he's ``had
very little success'' in getting forest service support for
revegetation efforts.
   Leonard and the six rangers at the hearing said more money is
needed to manage the wilderness areas. Vento agreed, saying that
only 32 cents a year is being spent on each wilderness acre,
compared to $6.39 per acre for general forest service lands.
   Since 1984, Congress has doubled the number of wilderness areas
to 352. It also has doubled the wilderness budget to about $15
million. Leonard said, however, that this ``doesn't give us the
resources to get ahead.''
   The rangers from the field continually emphasized one point:
beyond one headquarters job in Washington, there are no full-time
jobs as wilderness rangers and no forest service career track in
wilderness management.
   As a result, there is little overall management planning,
considerable turnover among skilled field people and little time
for rangers to do much more than keep a cursory watch on the remote
acreage under their domain.
   ``The reality of a person only working five months is that there
is little planning time available,'' said Linda Merigliano, the
ranger responsible for the 116,500-acre Jedediah Smith Wilderness
in Wyoming.
   She said that because of tight money, 63 percent of her trail
system is substandard and deteriorating. She estimated it would
cost $162,295 for labor and materials to repair the trails.
   ``Most of the impacts occurring in the Jedediah Smith Wilderness
result from visitor ignorance of appropriate camping and traveling
behavior,'' said Merigliano, adding that she couldn't get $50 to
put together a slide show about proper camping techniques.
   She said that despite the requirements of the Targhee National
Forest Plan, her area lacks an assessment of its campsites.
   Lee Kirsch, the ranger for three areas in Colorado's San Isabel
National Forest, said such assessments in her areas found 85
percent of the campsites violating wilderness regulations.

   The Pentagon has ignored congressional orders
to do a better job of testing weapons before it invests in
multimillion-dollar programs, says the watchdog arm of Congress.
   As a result, the Pentagon's 5-year-old weapons testing program
still cannot adequately assess whether weapons would work in
combat, the General Accounting Office says.
   The GAO review deals with the Pentagon's Office of Operational
Test and Evaluation, which was created by Congress in 1983 in an
attempt to do a more realistic job of testing weapons.
   The legislation was triggered by the discovery of serious flaws
in several major weapons systems after they were well into
development.
   The GAO report was released Tuesday by the Congressional
Military Reform Caucus, a group of 140 legislators who banded
together in 1981 to seek management changes in the federal
government's largest single agency.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a caucus member, told Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci the Pentagon had ignored Congress'
orders to test weapons realistically.
   ``Congress cannot depend on the realism of the weapons tests, or
the independence of the testing reports we receive,'' said Bennett.
   Carlucci, appearing at a House Armed Services Committee hearing,
said he hadn't seen the report and couldn't comment on its
specifics.
   But he then went on to criticize what he said is ``an increasing
tendency on the part of members of Congress'' to seek GAO reviews
without giving the Pentagon a chance to review the reports before
they are released.
   Dan Howard, Carlucci's spokesman, was even more critical. ``The
difficulty is that those (members of Congress) who do not wish to
inform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance,
obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing
programs,'' he said.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a co-sponsor of the 1983 legislation,
said: ``I am disappointed, but hardly surprised. I have never seen
evidence of any desire by the Pentagon or this administration to
make this office work as we in Congress intended it to work.''
   The GAO reviewed the Pentagon's test of six major weapons,
including the Navy's Aegis air defense. That is the sophisticated
tracking system involved in the July 3 shootdown by the Navy
cruiser Vincennes of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. The
Pentagon says the ship thought it was firing at an Iranian F-14 and
is investigating the incident.
   The other weapons in the GAO study were the Army's Aquila drone
plane; the Army's helicopter improvement program; Navy Tomahawk
conventional cruise missile; the newest targeting system for the
Air Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRN system for
night-time targeting.
   The GAO concluded that there were ``significant problems and
limitations in the planning, execution, realism, analysis, and
service test agency reporting of the six'' programs. Some of these
problems and limitations ``were unavoidable due to time, resource
or safety constraints, although numerous others were not.''
   The GAO study said the Pentagon hadn't followed congressional
orders to make the tests as realistic and combat-like as possible.
   For example, ``the prevailing problem for operational users was
that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically
high in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called `golden
crews,''' the review said.
   Another example: In some instances contractors were permitted to
help military crews maintain the weapons ``although that contractor
support would not be available in the field.''
   The problem was compounded by the fact that test data was often
misread, the GAO said. ``In five of six cases, we found problems
with the various assumptions underlying the analyses of the test
data. In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overly
optimistic estimates of the system's capability, one of which was
contracted by available data.''
   There were other ``questionable practices'' in interpreting data
and their impact ``was significant,'' the GAO said. ``They
frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance
requirements.''
   Flaws cited by the report included the fact that crews used for
both the Army helicopter tests and Maverick tests were specifically
trained for the tests, rather than being normal crews; and tests of
the Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested flight routes.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham on Tuesday rejected
a demand by Gov. Rose Mofford that he turn over to the state a
``protocol fund'' that figured in his impeachment trial.
   Instead, Mecham said he planned to return the roughly $80,000 to
those who contributed to it in the first place.
   The money was raised through ticket sales to Mecham's January
1987 inaugural ball and was originally intended to help pay off
some of his campaign debts.
   But corporations had bought some of the tickets, and state law
bars corporate campaign contributions. So Mecham aides later agreed
to treat the money as a kind of ``protocol fund'' to pay for gifts
to visitors and similar expenses that state budgets normally don't
cover.
   Mrs. Mofford and Attorney General Bob Corbin contend that the
agreement turned the fund into state property, and they told Mecham
last week that he had until the close of business Tuesday to turn
over the money or face a civil suit.
   But Mecham said in a speech Tuesday that he believed his
solution was a better one, and spokesmen for Mrs. Mofford and
Corbin said the officials were willing to negotiate further before
suing.
   ``We are not champing at the bit to file this suit,'' said
Corbin spokeswoman Maria Khan. ``We want to discuss it with people
in the governor's office and Mr. Mecham's lawyers.''
   Mrs. Mofford's spokesman, Vada Manager, said the governor
``still is following the advice of the attorney general.''
   Mecham was convicted April 4 by the state Senate on impeachment
charges, including one that he had misused the state funds when he
loaned much of the protocol fund to his car dealership.
   Mecham maintained that the money was a private account even
though it was being used for state purposes. And he said lending
the money to his dealership allowed the fund to garner higher
interest than a regular bank account would have earned.
   On Tuesday, Mecham said he would fight any suit but would hold
off on making refunds for ``a couple of weeks'' to let Corbin file
suit. Khan declined to say why Corbin didn't accept the idea of
returning the money to the contributors or what compromise his
office might approve.

<HEAD>US, Hong Kong Deals Help Increase Foreign Trade 20 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp increases in trade with the United States
and Hong Kong helped push China's foreign trade up nearly 20
percent in the first half of 1988, officials said today.
   Spokesman Liu Xiangdong of the Ministry of Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade told a news conference that trade for the
period totaled $35.85 billion, 19.5 percent above last year's
figure.
   He said exports were up 16.1 percent to $20.22 billion and
imports climbed 24.3 percent to $15.63 billion.
   China's foreign trade is ``stable and healthy'' and
``demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old
system to the new,'' Liu said.
   China is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade and
trying to develop export industries while confining imports to
machinery and high technology items that will help in the nation's
modernization drive.
   ``The unchecked importation of production lines and high durable
consumer goods was basically controlled,'' Liu said.
   He said that through May, China's trade with the United States
was $2.89 billion, up 26.3 percent from the first five months of
1987. Trade with the Hong Kong region totaled $7.54 billion, up
35.5 percent.
   Trade with Japan was $5.49 billion, up 8 percent; with the
European Economic Community $3.775 billion, up 3.5 percent; and
with the Soviet Union $1 billion, up 32.1 percent, Liu said.
   The ministry's figures differed from those released this month
by the Customs Office, which showed China with a trade deficit of
slightly more than $1 billion on total trade of $43.2 billion.
   Liu said the two offices have different ways of calculating
goods imported and then processed for export. He said his ministry
does not include imports of equipment by foreign-funded enterprises
that will be used to produce goods for export.
   Liu also said 2,109 foreign-funded enterprises were approved in
the first half of the year, an increase of 186 percent over
January-June 1987. He said the value of those contracts was $2
billion, up 130 percent.
   Projects funded by investors in the United States jumped from 34
last year to 85 this year, Japan from 39 to 85, Singapore from 20
to 36, Canada from three to 13 and West Germany from three to 10.
   Hong Kong continued to lead foreign investors with 79 percent of
projects and 67 percent of money invested.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York City Opera's new production of
``Rigoletto'' made a favorable first impression Tuesday night at
the New York State Theater, helped by a high caliber of singing.
   Tenor Richard Leech of Binghamtom, N.Y., who played the Duke,
has a golden voice and thrilled the audience as he held the last
note of his biggest aria. His Duke was more like a heedless college
man than a hardened womanizer. It was easy to understand how Gilda
could stay in love with him even after two betrayals.
   Leech made his New York City Opera debut in 1984 and this year
won the Richard Tucker Foundation Award and will make his
Metropolitan Opera debut.
   Faith Esham, whose voice is clear and whose presentation is much
more lyric than coloratura, was an exceedingly pure but human and
agreeable Gilda.
   Frederick Burchinal, whose baritone is clear and interesting,
played a middle-range Rigoletto. His characterization was not
passionate, and one did not feel enormously sorry for this
Rigoletto when his troubles began, then compounded.
   Tito Capobianco devised and directed the production. Some
staging innovations work well: Rigoletto's patio in Scene 2 is
upstairs on the bedroom level of his house; Act 3 has Sparafucile's
Inn near the front of the stage, which places singers forward,
where they can project.
   A bridge indicates the river into which Rigoletto intends to
dump the Duke's body after Sparafucile murders him. The bridge
connects to upstairs rooms in the inn. The Duke not only sings from
his inn bedroom, making Rigoletto realize he's alive, but casually
walks away across the bridge, right in front of Rigoletto, a nice
touch.
   Elio Boncompagni conducted the Verdi melodies that dance even
while the plot turns tragic.

   The arts are a $17 billion-a-year sector of the
British economy and one-fourth of the country's tourist income is
spent on cultural activity, a non-profit institute reported today.
   The report by the Policy Studies Institute says the arts account
for 2.5 percent of all spending on goods and services in Britain
and directly employ 496,000 people, or 2.1 percent of the work
force.
   ``The Economic Importance of the Arts in Britain'' says 27
percent of the $9.2 billion spent annually by overseas visitors in
Britain is connected to arts attractions.
   The three-year, four-volume study is being sent to the
government, local councils, private business, tourism authorities,
arts organizations and private foundations that helped to fund it.

<TEXT>
   Most restaurants in this desert resort serve
water on request only, towering hotel-casinos have reduced the flow
from thousands of showerheads and a showroom elephant waits longer
for her bath to be changed.
   The drought has come home to Reno, but its slot machine bells
still jangle and chips still fly across its felt gambling tables.
   In fact, the drought that has stunned the nation's midsection
with its severity hasn't surprised hotel owners here.
   After two consecutive years in which the area has received half
its scant 7.5-inch annual precipitation, Reno is in a Stage One
drought alert, calling for voluntary cutbacks in water use. Stage
Two, which mandates some unenforced reductions, is expected by
mid-August.
   Unlike Las Vegas, where the Colorado River provides more than
enough water to the casinos and their shimmering fountains, Reno
depends almost solely on runoff from winter snow in the Sierra
Nevada for its summer water.
   And the snow is gone.
   Restaurants, hotel-casinos and other businesses here typically
have been watchful of their water use, partly because they pay for
every drop.
   ``Our per-person use is half that of residential consumption,''
said Glenn McCormick, chief engineer at the Peppermill Hotel Casino.
   McCormick estimates that water-saving conversions at the
year-old hotel tower have produced a minimum savings of 3 million
to 4 million gallons of water annually for little more than the
cost of the time it took to make them.
   While some hotels here and at Lake Tahoe have installed
restricted-flow shower heads and water-saving toilets, McCormick
opted to modify the existing fixtures.
   ``You don't have to spend a lot of money,'' he said. ``People go
out and buy a lot of gadgets they don't need.''
   He cut back the Peppermill's water use by putting smaller
washers in shower heads and reducing pressure in the taps. Lower
water levels in hotel toilets cut consumption from 6 gallons per
flush to 4, he said.
   Outdoor watering was decreased by replacing thirsty plants with
decorative rocks or vegetation better suited to the desert.
   At John Ascuaga's Nugget in nearby Sparks, all outside plants
are watered by drip irrigation installed during the past year,
according to spokesman Art Long.
   The Nugget, like other local hotels, recycles water in air
conditioning cooling towers and loads dishwashers completely before
starting them.
   Conservation even has affected Bertha, the Nugget's trained
elephant who warms up showroom crowds for entertainers like Red
Skelton and Shirley MacLaine.
   ``We used to clean and drain her pool twice a week. Now it's
down to once a week. And the water that's pumped out is used to
water the lawn and foilage around Bertha's Elephant Palace,'' Long
said.
   Homeowners, however, successfully fought efforts to require
water meters. They pay a flat monthly fee regardless of how much
water they use. New homes are required to have water meters, but
there still are nearly 50,000 with virtually unlimited water use.
   ``Hotel-casinos are not the biggest users. I think they take a
bad rap,'' said Bob Firth, water resources manager for Westpac
Utilities.
   Businesses use only 22 percent of the 90 million gallons or so
his company pumps out daily, Firth said. By comparison, he said, 47
percent of the daily summertime use goes for watering lawns and
hedges.
   The Reno area's last prolonged dry spell was in 1976-77, and
even though those years were a little wetter than the past two,
``we got through kind of by the skin of our teeth,'' Firth said.
   ``The difference between now and 1976-77 is that we've had a 33
percent growth rate,'' Firth said. ``Measures may have to be a lot
more drastic than they were at that time.''

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
was focusing on state crime and prison issues today before heading
out on a three-day campaign swing that will take him to seven
states.
   The Massachusetts governor was touring a prison construction
site, meeting with his anti-crime council and signing legislation
imposing stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child
pornography before heading home to pack for the campaign trip that
begins Thursday.
   Dukakis spent most of Tuesday tending to state business as well,
but took time at an afternoon news conference to blast President
Reagan and Vice President George Bush for supporting Attorney
General Edwin Meese III even after two Justice Department officials
quit because of the attorney general's conduct.
   ``When that happens, I don't think there are any further
questions,'' Dukakis told reporters. ``He's got to go and he's got
to go immediately. ... Instead, they continued to defend him and
with their support he continued to serve as attorney general.''
   Dukakis _ pointing to Bush's inaction in the Meese case _
appeared unimpressed with Bush's call Tuesday for new government
ethics standards.
   ``You've got to act,'' Dukakis said. ``You don't need codes. You
don't have to have a book.''
   Dukakis referred to the resignations earlier this year of Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns and former Assistant Attorney General
William Weld, who told Congress on Tuesday that Meese's legal
problems had crippled the Justice Department. Weld said he believed
Meese had committed felonies. Weld and Burns said they told Reagan
and Bush of their concerns in April.
   ``I hope I never have a briefing like the one Mr. Burns and Mr.
Weld gave the vice president three months ago,'' Dukakis said.
``But if I do, I won't sit there and do nothing.''
   Dukakis said the American people ``are embarrassed and ashamed
by some of the things that they see'' in the Reagan administration.
   Dukakis also renewed his criticism of Bush for not trying to
block the arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``How can anyone possibly just sit there when someone came up
with a proposal so crazy?'' Dukakis said. ``That's the issue, It's
a question of judgment. ... You can't make deals for hostages. If
you do, you better forget about breaking the back of international
terrorism.''
   He also questioned the viability of Bush's new day-care proposal
and scoffed at talk that he was planning to resign to concentrate
on his presidential campaign.
   Bush this week proposed a $2.2 billion program that would give
tax credits to working mothers, especially those with relatively
low family incomes. Dukakis said he supported spending that much
for day care, but said that he wanted local governments and private
business to pick up some of the tab and that initial funding
probably would not be that high.
   He also criticized the Bush program as too complicated, saying,
``A policy that would require every welfare mother in the country
to hire an accountant just doesn't make sense.''
   There were renewed rumors in the Massachusetts Statehouse this
week that Dukakis was preparing to resign, but he said he planned
to stay on as governor and, if elected, would resign only after
being inaugurated as president.
   He laughed when told that Reagan had said Democrats got his
``Irish up'' by criticizing the administration during the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``It's a political season,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got 110 days
to go and I assume the president will be as political as anyone
else.''

<TEXT>
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu already has
carved out a role for himself in the 1988 presidential campaign _
as a strong, sometimes vindictive attacker of Michael Dukakis,
governor of neighboring Massachusetts and the Democratic
presidential nominee.
   But Sununu is under consideration for another supporting role _
that of running mate to Republican nominee-to-be George Bush.
Sununu himself said Tuesday that he had been asked to fill out the
questionnaire being circulated by the Bush campaign to potential
vice presidential picks.
   Sununu, speaking to reporters here, played down his prospects of
being chosen. Asked what the odds were, he said, ``I don't gamble.''
   Even if his chances of being chosen to fill out the ticket are
slim, Sununu is likely to be a visible player in the coming general
election campaign.
   He has been described by Democrats as a hit man with a venonmous
tongue. Supporters say he just presents the facts.
   Chuck Dolan, executive director of the Democratic Governors'
Association, calls Sununu a ``rattlesnake ... out of the rocks in
New Hampshire.''
   But GOP consultant Eddie Mahe says, ``If you don't have a strong
swing with a 2-by-4, you don't get attention.''
   Sununu, chairman of the National Governors' Association and one
of five co-chairmen of the Bush campaign, is in demand as an
interviewee, according to aide David Carney. He describes his boss
as an entertaining speaker with a good sense of humor who gets his
message across.
   ``When the governor gets done speaking, you're going to
understand what he's saying. You many not agree, but you will
understand,'' Carney said. ``No one falls asleep listening to John
Sununu.''
   Sununu was credited with helping boost Bush to victory in the
New Hampshire primary _ a crucial race, especially after Bush's
third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
   The New Hampshire governor has had a ringside seat for the six
years of Massachusetts' economic transformation. But he derides
Dukakis' description of a ``Massachusetts Miracle,'' instead
calling it the ``Massachusetts Mirage.''
   Sununu maintains that Massachusetts appears prosperous when
viewed from outside the region, but that business indicators do not
compare favorably with the rest of New England, especially New
Hampshire.
   ``Mike Dukakis is an expert at the theater of politics,'' Sununu
says. ``He has a superb veneer. That's the whole point. Once you
cut through that veneer there's not much there.''
   He also has attacked Dukakis on issues including education,
mental health care and pollution in Boston harbor.
   Sununu, 49, who lives in Salem on the Massachusetts border and
taught at Tufts University outside Boston before becoming governor,
plays up the state rivalry that heated up in the 1970s.
   ``The best way to kill something in New Hampshire is to say this
is the way Massachusetts does it,'' said Sununu's aide Carney.
   The Dukakis campaign has not been surprised by the fervor of
Sununu's attacks, spokesman Dayton Duncan said. Dukakis himself has
seldom responded to the attacks.
   ``Normally, we ignore it, but we point out the facts,'' Duncan
said.
   The biggest clash between Sununu and Dukakis is over the
Seabrook nuclear plant, located on the New Hampshire seacoast about
35 miles north of Boston.
   Sununu worked with the nuclear industry before his three terms
as governor and is a strong proponent of nuclear power and
Seabrook. Dukakis' refusal to cooperate on an evacuation plan for
Massachusetts communities within Seabrook's emergency zone has been
a major obstacle to licensing the plant.
   ``Mike Dukakis prevented Sununu from doing what New Hampshire
didn't want done _ that's ramming Seabrook through, which is his
mission in life as governor,'' said Duncan.
   Some Dukakis partisans suggest Sununu is a bit envious of
Dukakis and his growing stature in national politics.
   And Dukakis' popularity in New Hampshire might rankle. An
offbeat poll of 400 voters in New Hampshire during the 1986
gubernatoral race gave Dukakis 47 percent, Sununu 37 percent, in a
hypothetical race for governor of New Hampshire. Boston news media
sponsored the survey, conducted by a Cambridge, Mass., polling firm.
   Former Sununu spokeswoman Gretta Graham, however, said Sununu's
attacks on Dukakis ``could not in any way be characterized as a
personal vendetta.''
   ``It's a competition basically between two strong managers,''
she said.
   The two remain cordial in public and have found common ground on
issues such as raising the drinking age to 21 and fighting acid
rain.
   Mahe, the GOP consultant, acknowledged that Sununu's practice of
``firing with both barrels'' could backfire, but said it is not yet
a concern of the Bush campaign.
   Alixe Glen, deputy press secretary for the vice president's
campaign, said the Bush camp will continue to pay for Sununu's
appearances around the country.
   ``He's been an enormously effective surrogate,'' she said, ``not
only advocating George Bush's candidacy and ideas, but also a very
effective spokesman on the record of Governor Dukakis.''

   More than 500 people were evacuated
Tuesday night when a forest fire swept through rural subdivisions
west of the city, burning four outbuilding and threatening homes.
   The fire, reported about 3 p.m. Tuesday, had grown to about 600
acres by 10 p.m. MDT and was expanding rapidly, said Corbin Newman,
fire information officer for the state Division of Forestry.
   Fifteen volunteer fire departments brought 25 engines to the
scene where 175 firefighters struggled to protect the homes. Some
260 more firefighters were expected to arrive during the night,
Newman said.
   ``As the fire passes one area the engines are moving ahead and
trying to get ahead of the fire,'' Newman said.
   The fire forced the evacuation of four subdivisions and homes
along a three-mile stretch of South Dakota Highway 4. Newman
described the area as mostly forest with some meadows. Homes were
scattered among the timber and the clearings, he said.
   Four helicopters were dropping water and a slurry bomber was
delivering fire retardant to protect the homes, he said. Four
bulldozers were working to dig a fire line around other buildings.
   He said there was no chance the fire would be contained Tuesday
night, although the wind was light.
   ``The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it
creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by
sucking in oxygen,'' Newman said.
   Most of those evacuated found lodging with friends and
relatives, said Lyle Baker, manager of the Black Hills Area Chapter
of the American Red Cross. About 60 families responded to a Red
Cross appeal for people to open their homes to those who were
evacuated, he said.
   ``We're spending more time now coordinating between family
members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said.
   Some families were separated in the confusion of the evacuation,
he said. In some cases people returned to get pets and free horses
from their pens in advance of the fire and became separated when
authorities wouldn't let them take the same route back out, Baker
said.
   Newman said the cause of the fire was under investigation.

<HEAD>Hunger Bill Clears Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate approval of a $388 million bill to
combat hunger in America could spark similar action in the House,
the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee says.
   ``When they see the Senate can do this with such a heavy, heavy
vote, it just could push them to action,'' Agriculture Chairman
Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said Tuesday after the bill won 89-7
approval.
   He said the bill would ``make a dent'' in the problem of hunger
if it became law and that it would ``help a lot of people who are
not going to be helped otherwise.''
   Leahy called for Senate approval, citing estimates that in 1986
there were 32 million Americans living in poverty, 85 percent of
them women, children, the handicapped and the elderly.
   The bill was opposed by the administration on budget grounds. It
would cost $388 million next year and spending would expand to $667
million in 1991, by administration calculations.
   Nonetheless, only token opposition materialized. Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, was prepared to offer three amendments designed to
reduce the costs. But the first one failed 81-14, and he decided to
drop the other two.
   The bill would reauthorize the Temporary Emergency Food
Assistance Program (TEFAP) for two years at a level of $50 million
each year for administrative costs. It also would require the
Agriculture Department to buy $145 million worth of high-protein
food each year for distribution to the needy.
   Gramm's amendment would have subtracted from the $145 million
the value of any surplus crops distributed to the poor. Government
economists are expecting a substantial surplus of corn in
government stocks at year's end despite the drought plaguing the
Corn Belt.
   Leahy said he lobbied hard against Gramm's proposals in the
Democratic Caucus, describing them as ``killer amendments'' that
would scuttle the bill.
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top Republican on the
Agriculture Committee, was a co-sponsor of the legislation and
pushed hard for it.
   Provisions of the bill would increase food-stamp benefits and
substantially broaden eligibility.
   It would require the department to buy $40 million in additional
commodities each year for distribution through soup kitchens, food
pantries and emergency feeding centers. These outlets for the most
part provide meals to the homeless.
   Seven million pounds of cheese would be allocated to a commodity
supplemental food program. The federal reimbursement rate for
school breakfasts would be increased by 3 cents, and federal
reimbursement for a number of food-aid programs for children would
be expanded.
   For example, an additional meal or snack would be served to
children who stay in day care centers for more than eight hours
while parents are working.
   The measure would provide a child-care deduction of up to $160 a
month to enable parents to work or receive education and job
training.

<HEAD>Judge Facing Impeachment Calls Self `Real Warrior'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal judge Alcee L. Hastings says he's in a
``fighting mood'' despite a House panel's recommendation for his
impeachment, and predicts the Senate will not remove a ``real
warrior'' from office.
   Hastings swiftly proclaimed his innocence and his optimism
Tuesday after three separate votes of 32-1 sent 17 articles of
impeachment to the full House.
   That action by the House Judiciary Committee sets the stage for
an unprecedented impeachment proceeding.
   House concurrence by a simple majority, as early as next week,
would lead to the first Senate impeachment trial of a federal judge
who was acquitted of the same charges in a criminal case.
   Also, never before has Congress held an impeachment trial for a
black official. Several committee members said before voting that
racism may have played a part in the initial charges, but all
eventually agreed the evidence nonetheless supported the
allegations.
   According to the impeachment articles _ similar to an indictment
_ Hastings and Washington, D.C. attorney William Borders ``engaged
in a corrupt conspiracy to obtain $150,000'' from two brothers who
were defendants before Hastings in Miami. Hastings, in return, was
supposed to impose sentences which would not require prison time.
   Hastings, 51, a U.S. district judge, also was accused of lying
at his trial on specific aspects of the conspiracy, of leaking
wiretap information in an apparently unrelated case, and of
``bringing disrepute'' on the federal judiciary.
   ``I'm in a fighting mood,'' Hastings said in Miami after the
vote. ``There's no way to remove a real warrior. I still don't
think I'll be removed from office.''
   He said the Judiciary Committee ``acted in blind ignorance''
because the findings of its investigative subcommittee have not
been printed. If the rest of the House follows the committee lead,
Hastings said, members will vote ``in even blinder ignorance.''
   The House only need vote by simple majority to send the case to
the Senate for trial, but senators must vote by a two-thirds margin
to convict.
   Eleven cases have reached an impeachment trial in the Senate,
and five officials have been removed _ all federal judges. Former
U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas, Nev. was
ousted in October 1986 in the last impeachment case.
   The Senate vote in the Claiborne case was preceded by trial
testimony before a special impeachment committee. Rep. Larry Smith,
D-Fla., suggested that the full Senate hear testimony in Hastings'
case because of the unprecedented prior acquittal.
   While Hastings was acquitted of the bribery charges, Borders was
convicted in verdicts that lawmakers called inconsistent.
   In Tuesday's committee votes, Rep. George W. Crockett Jr.,
D-Mich., opposed all but one of the impeachment articles, while
Larry Smith, D-Fla., opposed one of the articles.
   Smith, who is white, and Crockett, who is black, were among
those describing their inner turmoil because of fears that racism
was involved in the case.
   Smith, who has known the outspoken Hastings for years, said, he
``cannot shake the feeling'' that ``there was a bit of racism
involved.''
   Smith said, however, that racism could not be the ``sole
motivation'' for the allegations, because there were ``too many
unique circumstances that can't be explained away by coincidence.''
   Crockett, a former city judge in Detroit, said anyone denying
racism in the case ``closes his eyes to conditions that still
exist.''
   But the lawmaker said the issue is whether Hastings is
``competent to sit in judgment of his fellow man and brings credit
to the judiciary.'' He said any judge who allowed himself to become
involved in such a case ``is too dumb to sit in judgment of
anyone.''
   Rep. John Conyers, chairman of the subcommittee that
investigated Hastings, gave an extensive account of the evidence
and admitted he initially wondered if ``racism could be the
source'' of the charges.
   But Conyers, who said he joined the Judiciary Committee to
remedy racism in the judiciary, said he looked ``for a scintilla of
evidence of racism'' and ``couldn't find any.''
   ``Black public officials must be held to the same standard as
all other public officials,'' he said.

   An artist's definition of beauty has
some of his neighbors arming themselves with lawnmowers and pruners.
   Neighbors call Ladislav Hanka's overgrown front yard an eyesore;
he calls it a ``natural meadow and wildflower preserve.''
   ``To a golf course owner, they're weeds,'' said Hanka, whose art
specializes in nature scenes. ``I see it as beautiful and I see it
as something becoming increasingly beautiful.''
   But many of the neighbors who have complained to city officials
since Hanka moved in in March 1987 say the half-acre, weed-infested
lot is becoming increasingly ugly.
   At a City Commission meeting Monday night, Hanka's next-door
neighbor Scott Temple said the yard was ``totally unkempt'' and
hurting property values.
   City Attorney Don Schmidt told the commissioners the lawn's
weeds and vegetation constitute a violation of the city's weed
ordinance and are a potential fire hazard.
   Hanka, however, said he has spent hundreds of dollars and
countless hours planting and weeding. Nonetheless, he was notified
by the city this month that if he didn't mow his lawn the city
would perform the task and bill him for it.
   The commission has since backed down from that stand, and
directed the city attorney to come up with an amendment to the weed
ordinance that would permit such wildflower meadows in the city.
The commission will then vote on the amendment.
   ``It's all comes back to that beauty is in the eye of the
beholder,'' said Garry McCormick, chairman of the city's
Environmental Concerns Committee.

   For most lottery winners, the pressure's
off once they pick their numbers. But John Cruz had to race to
claim a $15.3 million prize he won and failed to collect a year ago.
   Cruz and his wife, Sally, of Cherry Hill, N.J., were at the
state Capitol Tuesday to claim a $15.3 million lottery prize they
won with a ticket purchased with $20 he found at a shopping mall
last July.
   The couple said they came within a few hours of forfeiting the
prize because Cruz tossed the ticket into a drawer at home and
didn't check the numbers from the July 15, 1987, drawing.
   Under lottery regulations, the prize money was scheduled to
return to the state treasury if the winning ticket was not turned
in by the close of business on July 15, 1988.
   Just a few hours before the deadline, Cruz read a Philadelphia
Daily News story about the missing ticket and recognized the
numbers as those he always played _ his birthday, his wife's
birthday and one other number he likes.
   Mrs. Cruz, 65, a retired portrait artist, remembered her husband
yelled, ``That's my number! That's my number!'' and raced into the
bedroom in search of the ticket. Then the pair drove the three
hours to Harrisburg at high speed.
   ``Sometimes I check them, sometimes I don't,'' added Cruz, 70, a
retired food company manager. ``But I never throw them away.''
   Later, as he held up the check representing the state's first
payment, Cruz joked, ``This won't go in a drawer.''

   Polly may want a cracker, but probably not
the ones Oklahoma City has held in storage the past 26 years.
   The 350 tons of rancid Civil Defense survival crackers were
declared surplus Tuesday by the city council, and now officials are
trying to figure out what to do with them.
   ``Nobody is interested in buying them, but some people have
offered to haul them off,'' said J.J. Steward, director of Civil
Defense, now called Emergency Management.
   Since 1962, the crackers manufactured by the Keebler Co. have
been in storage at sites throughout the city, Steward said. They
were intended as a hedge against starvation in case of nuclear
attack.
   Some have suggested using the crackers to feed hogs or cattle,
although Steward said he isn't pushing an effort to get rid of them.
   ``A stale cracker would still taste better than a grub worm or a
rat,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Heads Off On First Solo Campaign Trip Since Joining Ticket</HEAD>

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen begins today his first solo
campaign trip since receiving the Democratic vice presidential
nomination, ranging from his Texas stronghold to stops in New
Mexico, California, Nevada, and deep South.
   Drawing on his record as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, Bentsen plans to speak today before a businesswomen's
group in Albuquerque, three days after Vice President George Bush
revealed his plan for a child-care tax cut before the same group.
   Bentsen, in an interview on Tuesday, said he was skeptical of
Bush's approach. ``I don't know what the cost would be,'' he said.
The senator said he would highlight his accomplishments in the
Senate including prenatal and child care legislation.
   From that appearance, Bentsen planned to fly to San Francisco
for a speech before a labor group, and to Reno to address state
legislators. After another California stop, in Ontario, he planned
to go to Amarillo, Texas, for a home-state rally in Senate opponent
Beau Boulter's hometown.
   Boulter, a Republican congressman, is running for Bentsen's
Senate seat. Bentsen is running for both the Senate and the vice
presidency, as he is allowed to do under Texas law.
   After the Texas stop, Bentsen will continue on to either
Lousiana or Mississippi before returning to Washington on Saturday.
   The 67-year-old senator ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1976, and he says this national campaign
won't be that different from what he's accustomed to.
   ``It'll be just as if I was running for the U.S. Senate in
Texas,'' he says. ``You know, it's a pretty good-size state, 254
counties.
   ``I'm sure I'll be spending more time in the Southwest, the
South and Texas, but not exclusively so,'' he said, citing energy
states outside of that area as places he also plans to visit.
Bentsen has long been an advocate for oil and gas interests in
Congress.
   Bentsen campaigned last weekend with Dukakis, introducing him in
most cases. The two men differ on many issues, with Bentsen usually
taking a more conservative position. For example, he favors school
prayer, new Pentagon weapons, and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   As Bentsen headed off to stump alone, he was not expected to
point up those disagreements.
   ``I'm not going to go through this campaign worrying about
that,'' he said. He and Dukakis agree on expanding education and
health care, and on many economic issues.
   ``I'm delighted with his reaction to my discussions on trade.
I'll be hitting that issue often,'' said Bentsen, who is currently
nursing a trade bill through the Senate.
   President Reagan vetoed an earlier version, which also included
a provision requiring 60 days' notice for plant closings. ``I think
we'll get it through before the Republican convention,'' he said.
   He and Dukakis have discussed how Bentsen's experience on trade
matters could be put to use if they win in November, but the
senator said he didn't want to find his role as vice president
restricted that way.
   Bentsen said he doesn't expect to see much more of Michael
Dukakis on the campaign trail, since the two can cover much more
territory traveling separately. But he insists they got along well
during their three-day cross-country tour after last week's
convention in Atlanta.
   ``He's an easy fellow to get to know. I'd heard all these
stories about him being distant, but I didn't find that the case at
all,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and the plastics
industry are opposing attempts to outlaw plastic six-pack holders
in favor of yokes made of biodegradable materials, a change that
environmentalists say would protect wildlife.
   Administration and industry officials told a House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries subcommittee Tuesday that more research is
necessary to determine what impact the by-products of a degradable
holder would have on marine life. But the environmentalists say
legislation is needed quickly to save seabirds and marine mammals
that are killed by the discarded plastic rings.
   Albert M. Manville II, a biologist for Defenders of Wildlife and
chairman of the Entanglement Network coalition, said plastic
six-pack containers can remain in the environment for ``hundreds,
perhaps thousands of years,'' killing wildlife that become
entangled and choke to death, or mistake the yokes for food and
strangle or die from starvation.
   ``The six-pack ring epitomizes the plastic pollution problem _ a
highly successful product that is functional and durable, and yet
ugly and deadly when improperly discarded,'' said Rep. Gerry E.
Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee on fisheries and
wildlife conservation.
   But Sylvia Lowrance, director of the Environmental Protection
Agency's solid waste division, warned that the proposed law has
``the potential for replacing one problem with another.'' And she
noted that even degradable yokes can stay in the environment for
several months before breaking down.
   Robert Smith, deputy assistant director at the Fish and Wildlife
Service, said his agency opposes the legislation because ``we do
not have information that indicates six-pack yokes are a major
threat to fish and wildlife resources.''
   ``They probably are not a major threat to wildlife population,''
Smith said.
   Environmentalists disagreed with that assertion and urged
immediate action.
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Manville. ``When is there sufficient
information?
   ``The majority of what is seen and reported involves animals on
shore. These reports probably represent only a fraction of what is
entangling fish and wildlife on the open oceans.''
   The United States produced 10 million tons of plastic waste in
1986, about 7 percent of the 158 million ton total, according to
Lowrance. Projections show the plastic trash total rising to 16
million tons by the turn of the century.
   The bill by Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., was passed by the
Senate in May and is pending before Studds' subcommittee and the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation and
tourism.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the commerce
subcommittee, said ``there may be reason to question the need for
congressional action'' in light of states' responses.
   Sixteen states have enacted similar laws, beginning with Vermont
in 1976.

<TEXT>
   Eighty-six percent of the nation's sewage
treatment plants met the July 1 deadline for complying with federal
standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The agency said 309 plants or 2 percent of the 15,486 public
treatment works in the nation have been referred to the Justice
Department or state counterparts for court action to force
compliance. Another 9.5 percent are either under court or agency
orders to comply according to an agreed schedule.
   This means 95 percent of the nation's sewage flowing through
treatment plants is treated to remove 90 percent of the
contaminants, EPA said.
   The July 1 deadline originally was set in 1972 for 1977, but was
extended twice. The last extension by Congress empowered EPA to
grant extensions beyond July 1, 1983, only if changed construction
conditions beyond control of the municipality or reductions in
federal aid made compliance impossible.
   Of the 423 plants serving more than 10,000 people that did not
meet the deadline, 203 have started construction, EPA said.
   After July 1, no more extensions can be granted unless a
community can prove it was physically or financially impossible to
meet the deadline.
   Several court decisions have held that unavailability of federal
aid is no excuse for not meeting the standards.
   Since 1984, the federal goverment has filed 125 lawsuits against
municipalities to force compliance.
   The Clean Water Act requires all public treatment plants to
achieve so-called ``secondary'' treatment, that is, bacterial
treatment that removes more than 90 percent of the pollutants.
   Non-complying plants often use only ``primary'' treatment, or
filtration and temporary retention in tanks for solids to settle to
the bottom.
   Six hundred fifty plants also are required to use advanced
treatment to remove nutrients such as phosphorous or toxic
pollutants such as heavy metals, and of these, 525 are in
compliance.
   Since 1972, EPA has distributed $45 billion in federal aid for
sewage plant construction, with state and local governments putting
up $15 billion.
   Grants in recent years have been running more than $2 billion
for the federal government's share of construction costs, now 55
percent. But by the early 1990s the program will have been
converted to a system of revolving loan funds run by the states.

<DATELINE>BOGOR, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in
the Cambodian conflict since Prince Norodom Sihanouk was deposed in
1970.
   March 18, 1970 _ Sihanouk is toppled in a coup led by his prime
minister, Lon Nol. The prince is exiled to China as Lon Nol forces
battle communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas supported by North Vietnam
and China in the fight for Indochina.
   April 17, 1975 _ The Khmer Rouge seize power in Phnom Penh and
attempt to form a primitive agrarian society. Hundreds of thousands
die in slave-labor camps and execution chambers. Starting in 1977,
Khmer Rouge forces launch bloody attacks on Vietnam's western
border.
   Christmas Day, 1978 _ Vietnamese forces launch a large-scale
invasion of Cambodia, capturing the capital in two weeks and
driving the Khmer Rouge into the mountain jungles of western
Cambodia.
   Jan. 7, 1979 _ Vietnam installs the Phnom Penh government.
   June 22, 1982 _ The Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk's forces and the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front of former Prime Minister Son
Sann form a resistance coalition in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, under
the auspices of the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. The coalition is recognized by the United Nations as
Cambodia's legitimate government. The guerrillas, armed mostly by
China, operate out of refugee-military camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   Aug. 16, 1985 _ Vietnam announces it will withdraw all its
troops by 1990 with or without a political settlement.
   Dec. 18, 1986 _ Pragmatist Nguyen Van Linh becomes head of
Vietnam's Communist Party, focusing on rebuilding the economy and
breaking the country's international isolation caused by the
Cambodian conflict.
   July 29, 1987 _ Vietnam and Indonesia, acting as ASEAN's
representatives, sign an agreement in Ho Chi Minh City calling for
informal talks.
   Dec. 2-4, 1987 _ Sihanouk holds unprecedented peace talks in
France with Hun Sen, prime minister of the Vietnamese-installed
government.
   Jan. 21-22, 1988 _ A second round of Sihanouk-Hun Sen talks
deadlocks over how to form a provisional government.
   May 26, 1988 _ Vietnam announces it will withdraw 50,000 troops
_ half its forces in Cambodia _ by the end of the year.
   June 30, 1988 _ Vietnam's military high command leaves Cambodia,
officials said.
   July 10, 1988 _ Sihanouk resigns as coalition president, saying
the Khmer Rouge are killing his men.
   July 25, 1988 _ After some dispute between Vietnam and ASEAN,
the cocktail party talks begin at the old presidential palace in
Bogor, a mountain resort outside Jakarta, Indonesia.
   July 27, 1988 _ Sihanouk re-emerges to hold talks with Hun Sen
in Jakarta.

<HEAD>Farmers Not Alone In Wanting Federal Drought Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Farmers, equipment suppliers and bankers
eagerly await $6 billion in prospective drought relief for a
depressed farm economy that was just beginning to recover when
Nature pulled out the rug.
   Without the aid, John Schroeder's financial future could be
grim. The farmer estimates that the drought has cut his corn
production by at least 40 percent, and he isn't certain yet how
much damage it has done to his soybeans.
   ``Some bills are due in the fall, and next spring we'll have
another whole round of them,'' said Schroeder, who farms 1,300
acres with his father and brother in northeastern Illinois'
Champaign County.
   In parched central Illinois, banker Bob Behrens thinks the aid
would ease loan repayment problems. Farm equipment dealer Norman
Duitsman hopes it would slow a sales slump. And grain elevator
manager Chuck Kemper believes it could help his fertilizer business.
   ``Many farmers will have significantly less income from grain
sales because of the drought, and that can have a domino effect,''
said Behrens, senior vice president at Marine Bank of
Champaign-Urbana. ``If he gets benefits from a federal program, he
will have that much more money to pay for other things.''
   On Tuesday, the House Agriculture Committee approved a drought
relief bill totaling $6 billion, including $145 million pushed by
dairy-state lawmakers for milk producers. The bill is expected this
week on the House floor.
   Robert Spitze, a University of Illinois farm policy specialist,
said the public realizes agriculture has ``been through a wringer
and is just beginning to work its way out.''
   ``Now, an act of God pulls out the rug,'' said Spitze. ``I think
if we'd just been through six years of prosperity, there would be
less willingness to help.''
   Behrens said federal drought aid could help farmers pay their
bank loans on time, where drought losses otherwise would have left
many unable to repay the banks at the usual rate.
   Duitsman, manager of Shaff Implement Co. in Urbana, hopes the
federal disaster money also might encourage some farmers to replace
aging equipment.
   ``Since this drought, our sales have dropped off to nothing,''
said Duitsman, who sells tractors, combines and tillage equipment.
``Farmers were just getting back on the road to financial recovery
and this hit. They'll be set back unless they get some help from
Washington.''
   Kemper, manager of Grain Prairie Coop, said the aid to farmers
will not help the grain elevator business in 1988 because ``volume
is the name of the game.''
   But he said any extra money farmers receive could help the
company's fertilizer sales.
   Scott Reifsteck, who farms 1,300 acres in Champaign County, said
drought had severely damaged his corn. His problems worsened this
week with a thunderstorm that dumped hail on his fields, damaging
the soybeans. Hail insurance will cover only his cost of
production, he said.
   ``Any help we get will be greatly appreciated,'' said Reifsteck.
``But, we've tightened our belt in the past and now it will be a
notch or two tighter.''
   But Reifsteck said no matter how Congress and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture decide to distribute drought aid, some
farmers will feel slighted.
   And Schroeder said he worries that Congress might go overboard.
   ``It's easy in a campaign year to overspend,'' he said. ``There
is nothing that would hurt the country more than doing that and
increasing the national debt.''

<TEXT>
   Doctors had told Amalia Lara to
expect a big baby, but their 10-pound estimate wasn't even close.
Her newborn son, Isaac, tipped the scales at 13 pounds, 6 ounces.
   Isaac, born Sunday, is off the chart at the state Bureau of
Vital Statistics, which only goes up to 11 pounds, 1 ounce.
   He's already wearing medium-size diapers and scrunching to fit
into a cradle.
   ``We were pretty surprised,'' Mrs. Lara said Tuesday. ``The
nurses were saying to my husband `Did you do this?'''
   Mrs. Lara said she feels fine and is looking forward to taking
her son home today. The newborn, 24\ inches long and about the size
of a 3-month-old, was a star attraction at the hospital.
   ``We had quite a few extra visitors wanting to see the baby,''
said Carol Harwell, a nurse on duty the night Isaac was born.
``Other nurses on break, other moms who had just had babies ....
everyone wanted to see him.''
   The boy is the fifth child for Apolonio Lara, 30, and his wife,
27, of Altamonte Springs. The baby was four days overdue and
delivered naturally, unusual for a baby his size.
   ``He has to be pretty close to the world record for a vaginal
delivery,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koren, who delivered Isaac.
   The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records has no such category. It
says the two heaviest viable babies weighed 22{ pounds at birth.
   Mrs. Lara and her husband, a construction worker, have two other
sons and two daughters, ages 3 to 11. Their 3-year-old son was
nearly 11 pounds at birth.
   The doctor noted that Isaac drank 8 ounces of formula within a
few hours of birth.
   ``I'm glad she's not nursing or she'd be up all night,'' Mrs.
Lara's husband said.

   Workers in the private sector who should be
honored for reporting activities that endanger public health or
safety are instead being intimidated into silence, says the sponsor
of a bill designed to increase protection for whistleblowers.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources labor subcommittee, said Tuesday that workers who help
avert disaster by reporting dangerous practices should be honored
as heroes.
   ``Instead, in too many cases, they are treated like pariahs,''
said the Ohio Democrat. ``Their reward is to be fired, harassed,
demoted or blacklisted for telling the truth.''
   Several workers who lost their jobs after bringing alleged
safety problems to light told the subcommittee that more protection
is needed for whistleblowers.
   Former poultry worker Bette Simon charged that practices by
Simmons Industries, Inc. during her six years of employment at the
company's Southwest City, Mo., plant constituted a serious public
health threat.
   She said chicken parts were left for months on trailers used to
haul live chickens to the plant.
   ``I observed live haul trailers arriving at the plant loaded
with live chickens covered with maggots,'' she said.
   Ms. Simon also charged that the birds were rinsed with water at
such high pressure that chicken manure was forced into the meat.
She said the process was changed to a chlorine solution rinse that
peeled the skin from the workers' hands.
   Ms. Simon said that after plant officials saw her talking with
federal inspectors, she was placed in more stressful jobs,
developed severe tendinitis in her hands and arms, and was
discharged for accumulating excessive disciplinary points.
   In April 1987, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety
and Inspection Service issued an order requiring Simmons to comply
with an intensified federal inspection program at the plant.
Service spokeswoman Jane Adams said the company was taken off the
intensified program last February.
   Simmons President Lynch Butler said the company does not deserve
the accusations. ``We are very proud of our plant,'' Butler said.
``We have a lot of internal controls to see that good sanitary
conditions are maintained.''
   Ronald Masters told the subcommittee that in 1982 he worked for
the Daniel International Construction Co. as a quality control
inspector at the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Kansas.
   Masters contended that in late 1983 and early 1984 he discovered
that pieces of structural steel may not have been installed or
might have been below specifications in a building designed for the
handling of nuclear fuel. In February 1984, he said, he started to
write the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the problem.
   ``My superiors saw what I was doing, took the steel erection
prints from me and went into the back room with the prints,'' he
told the subcommittee. ``They then falsely marked up the prints to
make it appear the inspections had been done when in fact they had
not.''
   Masters said he was laid off in August 1984 after a campaign of
intimidation and harassment by his superiors.
   Lyle Koerper, spokesman for Kansas Gas & Electric, which
operates Wolf Creek, said the NRC extensively explored any
allegations of construction problems at the plant prior to issuing
a license in June 1985. Koerper said further comment would be
inappropriate because Masters has filed a lawsuit against the
utility.
   Metzenbaum's bill would create a uniform definition of protected
whistleblower activity for private-sector employees and give them
180 days to file a complaint. It would also extend federal
protection to whistleblowers in the aviation, maritime,
pharmaceutical, food processing or consumer goods industries.
   Fred Alvarez, assistant secretary of labor for employment
standards, said the department has some serious questions about the
bill, including its ``extremely broad reach,'' but the agency is
still reviewing the measure.

<TEXT>
   Playboy empire founder Hugh Hefner, whose
magazine described him as living by the motto ``Marriage is the
death of hope,'' has proposed to the most recent of his companions
at the Playboy mansion.
   The object of Hefner's affections is Kimberley Conrad, 24, the
magazine's Miss January 1988 who moved into the mansion in January,
along with her two dogs, Leilynd and Dior, and a cat named Spooky.
   ``Mr. Hefner has indeed popped the question Saturday night at a
romantic moment over the wishing well at the Playboy mansion,''
Hefner spokesman Bruce Binkow said Tuesday evening.
   No wedding date has been set, he said.
   Hefner, 62, is quoted in Playboy's August issue as saying:
``I've always felt that my life was rather like a movie. But my
relationship with Kimberley is better than any script ...
   ``She's open, sincere and straight _ just what I need at this
point in my life.''
   Ms. Conrad, whose picture appears on the cover of the issue,
said the fact that Hefner is 38 years older than her doesn't
concern her. ``I adore him,'' she said.
   The article, ``The Great Palimony Caper,'' said Hefner ``has
lived by Woody Allen's law: ``Marriage is the death of hope.''
   Hefner married Mildred M. Williams in 1949; the couple had two
children including daughter Christie Hefner, now president of the
Playboy business empire.
   Since his divorce more than 30 years ago, Hefner has advocated
the free-swinging lifestyle that came to be known as the ``Playboy
philosophy.''
   Ms. Conrad, who was born in Alabama but grew up in Vancouver,
Canada, began her relationship with Hefner shortly after his split
from his longtime companion Carrie Leigh, another Canadian model.
   Ms. Leigh, Playboy's 1983 cover girl, earlier this year
attempted to bring a $35 million palimony action against Hefner
after their affair soured, saying he had promised to marry her and
father her child. Hefner, who said the lawsuit was a publicity
stunt, countered with a $1 million cross complaint.
   She later dropped her lawsuit as did Hefner.
   Ms. Leigh moved into the mansion in 1983 when she was 19,
succeeding Shannon Tweed, who had also dreamed of being Mrs.
Hefner, according to the Playboy article.
   ``Marriage?'' Ms. Tweed recalled in the article. ``We joked
about it. If he wanted something from my side of the bed, I'd tell
him, `Sure, I'll hand it over if you marry me.' Hef getting married
was such an absurd idea _ we thought it was funny.''

   The Senate approved a measure to bar stations
from airing sexually explicit material between midnight and 6 a.m.,
with sponsoring Sen. Jesse Helms declaring ``garbage is garbage''
regardless of the time of day.
   By voice vote Tuesday, the Senate approved a Helms amendment to
a pending appropriations bill directing the Federal Communications
Commission to end its ``safe harbor'' and giving it until Jan. 31,
1989, to draft new regulations.
   The overall legislation, appropriating $15 billion for the
State, Justice and Commerce departments for the 1989 fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, will be sent to a conference with the House,
which already has passed a version of the bill.
   Helms, who said he acted in the interests of ``defending decent
moral values,'' asserted the FCC decision to permit adult
broadcasting after midnight violated the 1934 laws regulating the
airwaves.
   Helms, R-N.C., complained that broadcasters under the new FCC
rules have been permitted to air programs which include
``disgusting bestiality, sodomy and child sex.''
   ``Garbage is garbage no matter what the time of day or night may
be,'' he told the Senate.

<HEAD>Castro Says End To Angolan War Near</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro told fellow Cubans
to get ready to welcome troops home from Angola because a
settlement is near in the 13-year Angolan civil war.
   ``We really are on the threshhold of a political solution,'' he
said Tuesday in a three-hour speech marking the 35th anniversary of
the start of the revolution that overthrew right-wing dictator
Fulgencio Batista.
   Castro also said Soviet-style economic and political reforms are
not in store for Cuba, which he said is improving its economic
performance through greater worker discipline.
   The revolutionary leader said Cuban troops can now leave Angola
because they have been victorious on the battlefield but will
remain ``until the last minute'' _ when a peace agreement is signed.
   ``It can't be abrupt,'' he said. ``If the agreement is achieved,
if the agreement is signed, we will proceed to the total withdrawal
of the internationalist force from Angola.''
   The governments of Angola, Cuba and South Africa reached an
agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from Angola
and independence for bordering South-West Africa, the South
Africa-administered territory also known as Namibia.
   Cuban troops are helping Angola's Marxist government battle
rebels of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which is
backed by South Africa and the United States.
   The agreement provides no timetable, and another round of talks
is scheduled for August.
   Castro said he couldn't discuss details of the agreement, but he
said it provides for the security of Angola and the independence of
Namibia.
   U.S. State Department sources said Cuba has sent up to 15,000
more soldiers to Angola since last fall to bolster the 40,000 Cuban
troops already there.
   Castro said reinforcements were needed because of events beyond
Cuban control. He did not say how many reinforcements were sent,
but that they were ``all the troops necessary to solve that
situation.''
   ``Our objective was not a military victory but a political, just
solution to the conflict,'' he said.
   The Cuban leader's speech on the anniversary of his failed
attempt to take the Moncada garrison in Santiago, Cuba's
second-largest city, generally is considered his most important of
the year.
   Castro, in his full beard, green uniform and cap, gesticulated
often and frequently touched the array of microphones in front of
him. His voice occasionally went hoarse, but he held the audience's
attention throughout.
   Officials said more than 200,000 people gathered in Santiago's
Plaza Antonio Maceo for the speech.
   Comparing the Soviet Union and Cuba, Castro said: ``Each must
have the right to do that which is convenient for it to do. It
would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the
solutions of other countries.''
   He said that despite Havana's unwillingness to embrace
Soviet-style reforms, there is no tension between Havana and
Moscow, which supplies Cuba with military and other aid.
   Castro rejected suggestions from the West that socialist
countries must adopt free-market policies to move their societies
forward.
   ``Cuba will never adopt methods, styles, nor philosophies, nor
idiosyncracies of capitalism,'' he said, calling such methods
``complete trash.''
   Castro said Cuba's ``rectification'' campaign, designed to
eliminate absenteeism and other labor inefficiencies, is starting
to produce results.
   Two years ago, he said lax work habits threatened to make Cuba a
nation of freeloaders. Cuba has since abandoned economic incentives
aimed at boosting production and instead emphasized greater worker
discipline at a time when other socialist governments are
introducing free-market reforms,
   Castro also said Cuba's one-party political system would not
change. He said the country has no room for ``pocket parties'' or
opposition groups.
   ``The (Communist) party is the one responsible for our country.
Here there is only one party,'' he said.
   Castro said a tragedy of the Third World is that so many dream
of easy life in capitalist countries.
   ``It's a dream, it's an illusion,'' he said. ``It's necessary to
work and to work hard.
   Although the attack on the Moncada in 1953 failed, the brutality
with which it was suppressed helped muster support for the
revolution that eventually led to Castro's triumphant march into
Havana on Jan. 1, 1959.
   Castro frequently referred in his speech the upcoming 30th
anniversary celebration of the revolutionary victory.

   A man has been sentenced to 15 years in
prison for squeezing to death a frail, 83-year-old man as the
victim resisted during a theft attempt.
   Willie J. Robinson, 32, had been charged with first-degree
murder, but pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder in the
March 4 death of Homer Berkebile.
   Robinson was trying to steal a heater and blankets from
Berkebile, authorities said. The bear hug snapped at least four
ribs.
   Berkebile, who suffered from emphysema and other ailments,
waited several days before going to a hospital. He slipped into a
coma and died six weeks later.

<HEAD>With PM-Iran Hostages Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said it will make
``no deals'' with Iran after Tehran offered to use its influence to
free American hostages in Lebanon if the United States releases
Iranian assets frozen in this country.
   ``I am not willing to make anything that sounds like a deal,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday, the same day
the proposal was aired by Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the
Iranian parliament, in a television interview.
   ``We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we are
concerned you just can't link the two,'' Fitzwater said. ``No
deals.''
   Fitzwater said it is ``interesting that there should be this
series of statements,'' but ``the clearest signal they could send
is to release the hostages.''
   In New York, Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said: ``We have said that we will not make deals on this
particular issue. We are very interested in getting them (the
hostages) out. And if they want to talk, we will be prepared to
talk, but that is a speculative question.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., told reporters Tuesday, ``I don't
think we can ignore anything that comes our way. But I think we
should reject anything that smacks of ransom or blackmail and this
sounds like both.''
   State Department officials said Iranian officials had made
proposals similar to Rafsanjani's previously and the Reagan
administration had rejected them.
   The officials said they assume Rafsanjani was referring to
military equipment which had been purchased by the Iranian
government during the reign of the Shah of Iran but had not been
delivered.
   President Carter withheld all such deliveries after the hostage
crisis began. Carter also refused to return to Iran military
equipment which Iranian authorities had sent back to the United
States for repair.
   The officials said they had no dollar figure on the military
equipment on which Iran has a claim.

<HEAD>Ousted Ladies Auxiliary In A Tizzy, Picket Bingo Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLISON PARK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not be Chicago '68, but since
the Hampton Volunteer Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary was
disbanded by six ``whippersnappers,'' generation gap tensions have
been flaring up at bingo.
   ``We're not going to leave. We're going to fight for what's
ours,'' auxiliary President Sherry Adams said Tuesday, a day after
leading an eight-woman picket line outside the firehouse as 50
people played bingo inside. ``If my husband ever did this to me,
he'd be dead meat,'' she said.
   Six members of the suburban Pittsburgh fire department voted
July 6 to disband the ladies auxiliary on grounds that the women
were difficult to get along with, did not provide coffee and soda
to firefighters at fires and did not include firefighters' wives or
girlfriends in their membership.
   ``I've been down here every Monday night. I've been in the
kitchen. I've baked. Why, after 40 years, do we have to be thrown
out like that?'' asked Mrs. Zimmerman, 75.
   ``It makes me sick to think that all these years there's only
six whippersnappers, I'd call them, that can vote us out,'' said
Genevieve Johnson, 74, an auxiliary member for 22 years.
   The all-woman auxiliary had 13 members _ many elderly, 10 of
them widows, and none the wives of active firefighters. Mrs. Adams,
at 38, said she is the youngest member.
   ``What woman at 70 years old wants to go out in the middle of
the winter and the middle of the night to give men coffee and
soda?'' Mrs. Adams asserted. ``But they did it. They did serve the
men coffee and food, but not in the last three, four or five
years.''
   ``We're going to have a fire auxiliary ... not a ladies
auxiliary, so anybody can join. If anybody wants to come down,
we'll give them an application,'' said department President James
Cannon, who said he did not vote on the matter.
   During the last eight years alone, the women said, they raised
$25,000 for the department through bingo games and craft bazaars.
   Cannon said the money helped pay for a storage room, a plot of
land to be used as a parking lot, tables and chairs, a water
fountain and other items.
   ``We don't even have a room of our own,'' Mrs. Adams said.
``They let us use the kitchen if we're lucky. They figure that's
where we should be. We're not even allowed through the front door.''
   On Monday night, the women carried signs reading, ``Six Members
Unfair to Women'' and ``Old Ladies Raised $25,000 1980-1988.''
   ``We've been very nice,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``We didn't want to
stop anyone from going in.''
   Mrs. Adams said the auxiliary has sought help for a possible
lawsuit against the firefighters from the National Organization for
Women, a legal services organization for the elderly and a local
lawyer. But, she said, the women probably will not sue if it will
cost them money.
   The group wants an apology because, she said, Cannon called them
``older ladies.''
   ``We do not want to go back,'' she said. ``But we do want to
know when this new organization is formed that these women and
members do have rights and (are) not to be governed by the men.''

<TEXT>
   Cuba, whose colorful casinos and risque
nightclubs drew an annual 250,000 tourists to the country before
the 1959 revolution, has launched a crash program designed to
triple tourism income by 1991.
   ``Our country really needs foreign exchange,'' Rafael Sed Perez,
director of the National Tourism Institute, told a news conference
Tuesday. ``There is reality _ the economic situation that our
country faces is very difficult.''
   He said Cuba hopes to increase the annual number of tourists
from 220,000 _ 193,000 of them from non-communist countries _ to
600,000 by 1991.
   Sed Perez said tourism could bring in more than $500 million a
year, second only to sugar as a source of foreign exchange, from
its current level of fourth place and $117 million.
   Before the revolution brought Fidel Castro to power, most of
Cuba's annual 250,000 tourists were Americans. Castro's Communist
government later took pride in announcing the elimination of such
social vices as prostitution.
   Sed Perez said Cuba is not worried that increased tourism could
encourage a return of vice or bring in bad influences from foreign
capitalist nations.
   ``There is no worry,'' he said. ``We don't see tourism
development as something negative.'' He said there are no
restrictions on movement of foreign visitors in the island.
   Sed Perez said 39,000 people now work in the tourist industry
and training programs will be established to meet the demand for
new personnel.
   The program calls for 12,000 hotel rooms available for foreign
tourists by 1991, up from 7,500 now.
   The most ambitious expansion plans are in Varadero Beach on
Cuba's northern coast, where 8,000 rooms will be added to 2,800 now
available. Sed Perez said Havana now has 50 percent fewer rooms
than before the revolution.
   He said one phase of the plan calls for reopening 16 hotels
shuttered or used for other purposses since the revolution, many of
them in Old Havana, to recover 1,600 rooms.
   A second phase is to refurbish such existing hotels as the
Habana Libre, once the Havana Hilton, where the elevators are
notoriously slow and the air conditioning extremely weak.
   A third phase will be building new hotels, including a second
tower at the Triton, the only hotel built in Havana since the
revolution, Sed Perez said.
   He said three or four hotels might be built in a joint
enterprise with a Spanish company, but he provided no details.
   Santiago will be among the areas to be included in the tourism
expansion.
   Castro visited the brand-new Hotel Bucanero outside the city
during activities leading up to Tuesday's celebration of the 35th
anniversary of the start of the revolution.
   Castro pronounced it ``magnificent'' and said it was an example
of what could be done in the industry. But some staffers, most
notably in the restaurant, are clearly new and ill at ease in
handling large tables.
   Castro said Tuesday in his anniversary speech that tourism could
help make up for low market prices for its leading export products,
notably sugar and petroleum from the Soviet Union that is resold by
Cuba.
   He said the marvels of nature on the island and Cuba's sunshine
can be sold.
   Castro also criticized what he called ``petite bourgeoisie'' in
Cuba who complain because the new hotel rooms are destined first
for foreign visitors bringing badly-needed foreign exchange.
   He noted that Cuba's lobster catch is exported for revenues used
to purchase imports of powdered milk.
   ``There are no children starving to death in this country,'' he
said.
   Cuba's No. 1 source of tourists currently is Canada with 50,000
visitors a year, followed by West Germany, Spain, Italy and Mexico.
U.S. citizens are restricted by their own government.

   About 5.7 million Chinese suffer from
tuberculosis and nearly 900 die from the lung disease every day, a
Public Health Ministry official said in a report today.
   The official China Daily quoted He Jiesheng, vice minister of
public health, as saying cases of tuberculosis have dropped sharply
over the past 30 years but universal vaccination is still not
practiced.
   In some parts of the country, only 60 percent of children have
been vaccinated, she said.
   The disease kills 320,000 people annually in this country of 1
billion people, the vice minister said.
   The incidence of TB in China is five times that of Japan and 55
times that of the United States, while the mortality rate is 10 and
40 times higher than those two countries, the vice minister said.

<HEAD>King Fahd: Saudi Arabia Won't Put Ideology In Way Of Arms
Purchases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd says his country will not
put ideology in the way of defense needs and will buy weapons from
any supplier of top-notch arms who is willing to do business.
   ``If matters become snarled with a certain country, we find
other countries, whether they are Eastern or Western, and we buy
arms and we do not buy ideology,'' Fahd said in a statement
distributed Tuesday.
   ``We shall not hesitate to acquire the arms we need from any
country in the world on condition that they be among the best
available,'' he said.
   The kingdom, a longtime U.S. customer, has been prevented from
buying some American sophisticated weapons because of the
pro-Israeli lobby in Washington, which has claimed the sales would
threaten Israel's security.
   Sales agreements this year reportedly could make Britain the No.
1 arms supplier for Saudi Arabia, replacing the United States.
   Fahd's statement was the most direct indication Saudi Arabia
will consider buying arms from the Soviet bloc and China despite
the absence of diplomatic ties between the Islamic kingdom and what
it considers atheistic countries.
   Saudi Arabia, in the first step of its kind with a communist
nation, has acquired medium-range missiles from China in a deal
negotiated over two years, according to reports earlier this year
by U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Fahd made the declaration in an address Monday night to army
officers in the holy city of Mecca for the annual pilgrimage known
as the hajj and the four-day Moslem feast of Eid al-Adha.

   Members of Congress get a preview today of a
powerful anti-Stalinist Soviet film that is packing movie houses in
Moscow: a drama on the crimes of Lavrenti Beria, the secret police
chief of Josef Stalin.
   ``The Cold Summer of `53'' is part of an exchange of movies
arranged by the year-old American-Soviet Film Initiative, which
recently screened the American motion pictures ``E.T.'' and
``Coming Home'' for the Supreme Soviet in Moscow.
   Alexander Proshkin, director of ``The Cold Summer of `53,''
appeared at a screening of his film at the Library of Congress
Tuesday and was joined by the director of the second Soviet film,
the long-banned ``Commissar.''
   Made in the 1960s, ``Commissar'' has been resurrected under
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness and has recently had a successful commercial run in New
York.
   Some 2{ million Soviet citizens are reported to have seen ``Cold
Summer of `53'' in one month.

   The Senate Finance Committee has cleared away
hundreds of errors in the 1986 tax overhaul law after a promise
that members will get a shot later at adding their own favorite tax
provisions.
   The chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, won quick approval of
the bill Tuesday by telling colleagues that separate package of the
provisions could be added to the bill when it reaches the Senate
floor, if it wins approval from a majority of the panel.
   Included in that package would probably be amendments benefiting
mutual fund shareholders and freelance writers and artists.
   Bentsen, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, cautioned that many tax incentives members want to
add cannot be accepted because of budget constraints.

<HEAD>House OKs Measure To Protect Atlantic Striped Bass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, praising a 1984 law for reversing
the severe decline in Atlantic striped bass, voted to extend the
statute for three more years.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife, said
Tuesday the striped bass is ``making a strong comeback'' because of
the law.
   The Studds legislation, which passed the House on a voice vote,
would extend the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act and an
emergency striped bass study for three more years.
   ``There are encouraging signs in some areas that the stocks may
be on the road to recovery, but the act must be reauthorized to
assure that the recovery continues,'' said Rep. Walter B. Jones,
D-N.C., chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee.

<HEAD>`Copycat Strangler' Escapes from Prison in Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIG HARBOR, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who tried to stage a killing to
divert suspicion from Hillside Strangler Kenneth Bianchi escaped
from prison Tuesday night, along with another inmate, authorities
said.
   Veronica Compton, 31, convicted of attempted first-degree murder
in 1981 in Bellingham, was serving a life sentence at the
Washington Corrections Center for Women, said Veltry Johnson of the
state Corrections Department.
   Also missing at the 9 p.m. head count was Candice L. Burk, 28,
due for release next Tuesday after serving time for Clark County
charges of possession of stolen property and forgery, Johnson said.
   He said the state of Oregon also had filed a detainer for Ms.
Burk for a previous escape, but he had no details of that case.
   Ms. Compton, who has been dubbed the ``Copycat Strangler,'' and
Ms. Burk, considered medium-security prisoners, apparently escaped
from the north side of the prison, but further details were
sketchy, Johnson said.
   The Pierce County sheriff's office and the Washington State
Patrol have been notified, he said.
   A jury convicted Ms. Compton of trying to strangle Kim Breed,
26, a part-time cocktail waitress, in a Bellingham motel September
1980 so authorities would think the person who strangled 10 women
in Los Angeles and two in Bellingham was still at large. Ms. Breed,
however, was able to escape.
   Ms. Compton, originally from the Los Angeles area, had said she
was in love with Bianchi. Bianchi pleaded guilty to the Bellingham
killings of two Western Washington University students and to five
of the Los Angeles Hillside Strangler slayings. The case got its
name because bodies were dumped on hilldsides in the Los Angeles
area.
   Bianchi is serving seven consecutive life sentences at the
Washington State Penitentiary near Walla Walla.

<TEXT>
   Striking police in the western state of
Gujarat burned buses and a police station, and paramilitary troops
fired tear gas at policemen's wives and children marching in
support, news reports said today.
   The state police declared an indefinite strike Monday to protest
the Gujarat government's move to disband unions and dismiss union
leaders calling for higher wages.
   Police and family members torched two state-owned buses in
Baroda early today, and a mob of police burned down a police
station Tuesday in Gandhinagar, the state capital, the United News
of India reported.
   In Ahmedabad, the state's largest city with 2 million people,
paramilitary troops shot in the air and fired tear gas shells when
policemen's families marched Tuesday to present a petition to
Gujarat's police chief, the Hindustan Times newspaper said.
   The protesters were shouting slogans, the paper said.
   There were no reports of casualties.
   The state government Sunday ordered the arrest of police union
leaders demanding higher wages and benefits. Officials said the
leaders were inciting a police rebellion.
   The government also banned four of the strongest police unions.
   Army and paramilitary troops were ordered to move in and disarm
the state's 59,000-member police force on Sunday. At least 55
police have been dismissed for insubordination.
   Policemen in 71 police stations have joined the strike, the
sixth by Gujarat police in nine years.
   An average constable earns about $142 a month, including extra
allowances for uniforms and other benefits. Unions are demanding
$214 a month and extra pay for policemen who work on holidays and
at festivals.

   The dollar rose slightly and share prices soared in
active trading Wednesday as traders awaited the release of U.S.
gross national product figures for the second quarter.
   The dollar opened at 132.50 yen and ranged between 132.37 yen
and 132.65 yen before closing at 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Tuesday's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
120.23 points Tuesday, surged 434.81 points, or 1.59 percent, to
close at 27,738.57.
   Heavy electrical, light electrical, construction and automobile
issues led the surge, analysts said.
   The U.S. report on second quarter GNP, the broadest measure of
economic growth, is being watched partly for indications it could
give in inflationary trends. Greater-than-expected GNP growth could
signal higher inflation, analysts said.
   The report was scheduled for release later Wednesday in
Washington.
   Stock prices also were supported by a burst of activity prompted
by the first day of trading for the August account. Wednesday's
transactions will be settled four trading days later on Monday. The
first day of trading for a new month's account usually attracts
buyers.
   The dollar, reflecting its overnight strength overseas, opened
at 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close, and was trading at
132.43 yen by late morning.
   ``The dollar was supported by market expectations that the U.S.
GNP data would show a solid performance of its economy,'' said one
dealer.

   GEORGE BUSH, calling for Congress to be placed under the same
ethics laws as federal officials: ``To exempt Congress from any of
these rules, as does current conflict-of-interest law, is to
establish a double standard that breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism
and, in my judgment, breeds abuse. No one, no institution, no body
of government should be above the law.''

need codes. You don't have to have a book.''
   
   REP. LYNN MARTIN, on word that women are being considered for
George Bush's running mate: ``One of the nicest surprises for me is
hearing ... many conservative members of my party talking about a

<TEXT>
   Operators of a preschool program say they
were stunned to learn the woman they hired as an aide five years
ago was wanted for allegedly hijacking a jetliner to Havana in 1969.
   ``If we had any indication that this woman was a hostage-taker,
we wouldn't be sitting here today,'' Robert Burns, head of the
board of directors of the Albany Head Start program, said Tuesday.
``There's nothing in her five-year history that would indicate any
abuse or violence toward children.''
   But authorities said the quiet mother her neighbors knew as
Haziine Eytina was 39-year-old Linda Joyce Grinage, who was
arrested Monday on a 19-year-old indictment for air piracy.
   Rifle-toting FBI agents surrounded the home of Grinage and her
husband, lawyer Mylo Eytina, then took her into custody on charges
of hijacking a Miami-bound Eastern Airlines flight with 146 people
aboard in 1969 and directing its pilot at gunpoint to fly to Cuba.
   Grinage and her then-husband, Tyrone Ellington Austin, allegedly
took a 2-year-old boy hostage on the flight from New York's Kennedy
International Airport, authorities said. The woman, who had her own
an infant strapped to her back, ran screaming up the aisle of the
plane, followed by Austin who was shouting ``Black power, Havana''
to terrified passengers and crew members, according to news
accounts of the hijacking.
   The passengers and hostage returned to Miami unharmed, and
Grinage apparently spent some time in Cuba with her husband,
officials said. Authorities said they do not know how Grinage
returned to the United States from Havana, but they lost track of
her during the 1970s.
   Austin died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank
robbery attempt in New York City.
   Patrons of the Calumet Restaurant next door to the Eytinas'
apartment in a working-class section of Albany said they had little
contact with the family in the three months they'd lived in the
neighborhood.
   Robert Roby, who lives in an apartment house next to the
Eytinas', said they ``just seemed like ordinary people,'' but he
only knew them well enough to say hello on the street.
   ``I was very surprised,'' Roby said. ``Not only that they were
living next door but that the FBI kept the case open for so many
years. ... It's kind of like the Mounties. They always get their
man.''
   An anonymous caller tipped authorities a year ago that Grinage
was living in Albany, said Barbara Cottrell, an assistant U.S.
attorney.
   Authorities said Grinaged used 14 aliases. FBI investigators
spent the last year painstakingly putting together pieces of
information about the case, including old photographs and
handwriting samples.
   ``We were just as shocked as everybody when the FBI was outside
with guns pointed at everybody,'' said Betty Bellino, director of
the Masterson Day Care Center a few doors from the Eytinas'
apartment.
   A glum-looking Grinage wouldn't talk to reporters as she was led
away in handcuffs from brief court appearances Monday and Tuesday,
but her husband labeled the charges ``absolute poppycock.''
   He said he and his wife had lived and worked in Albany for 10
years, although police had only traced her Albany residence to 1983.
   ``I think people should speak highly of me and my wife because
we've worked diligently to be spoken highly of,'' Eytina said
Tuesday, after a federal court hearing to establish his wife's
identity was put off for one day.
   The couple had six children, but one was killed last year in an
auto accident, said Wayne Alford, a spokesman for the FBI's Albany
office. He said he didn't know how long they had been married.

<TEXT>
   Associates of attorney Richard J. Phelan say he's
not a Democratic activist, despite Republican criticism of his
appointment to investigate the ethical conduct of his fellow
Democrat, House Speaker Jim Wright.
   On Tuesday, the 51-year-old Phelan was named to investigate
Wright by the 12-member House Ethics Committee, which is evenly
divided between Democrats and Republicans.
   Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., said members of
both parties were satisified Phelan could do an impartial job.
   But some Republicans were upset with the choice, noting that
Phelan had raised money for Democratic U.S. Sen. Paul Simon's
failed presidential bid and was elected as a Simon delegate from
Illinois to the Democratic National Convention.
   ``The appointment of liberal Democrat activist Richard Phelan as
outside counsel in the Wright case certainly calls into question
the independence of the ethics committee inquiry,'' said a
statement from a group called Citizens for Reagan.
   Some of Phelan's associates, however, took issue with the GOP
criticism.
   Although he was elected as a delegate to the Democratic
convention last week, Phelan decided not to go.
   Phelan resigned his position as a delegate before the
convention, said Simon spokeswoman Terry Stephan. Ms. Stephan did
not indicate why Phelan had resigned.
   Amy Zisook of Chicago, Simon's national finance director, said
she would not characterize Phelan as an ``activist.''
   ``I assume he's been active locally, but I've been involved in
Democratic politics at the statewide level for six years and this
year was the first time I ever met Mr. Phelan,'' Ms. Zisook said.
   A law partner of Phelan's firm, Phelan, Pope & John Ltd., said
Phelan may have contributed money to candidates in the past, but
had never run for office himself.
   ``He may have political interests, but his main interests seem
to be his firm and his family,'' said the partner, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Last year, Phelan successfully defended Jewel Companies Inc., in
a lawsuit in which attorneys sought $100 million in punitive
damages for hundreds of people sickened in the nation's largest
outbreak of salmonella.
   The 1985 outbreak had been traced to milk from a Jewel dairy in
suburban Chicago. The copany ended up compensating those who fell
ill for their actual losses but not paying extra punitive damages.
   The contract with Phelan's firm will be for no more than
$300,000, Dixon said, adding that he could not estimate how long
the investigation would take.
   Charges against Wright include using his office to lobby federal
officials and others on matters in which he had a financial
interest, and improprieties in the publication of a book by a
campaign contractor for which Wright received unusually high
royalties.
   ``As I see our job, it's to conduct an independent, full review
of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report
back to the committee,'' Phelan told reporters outside the closed
committee room.
   ``The fact that I'm a Democrat doesn't stand in my way of being
fair and full.''
   A Chicago native, Phelan graduated in 1958 from the University
of Notre Dame, and received his law degree from Georgetown
University in 1961. He served as president of the Chicago Bar
Association from 1985-86.
   The attorney and his wife, Carol, an architect, have three
children. They live in a northern Chicago suburb.

   The proposal by Sihanouk upstaged peace negotiations in Bogor

guerrilla coalition that has been trying to topple it.
   He told representatives of all four factions, who traveled to
Jakarta to hear him, that the proposed four-party government in
Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, would be ``a collegial system
perfectly equal.''
   He suggested that ``we keep intact our four armies but they
fraternally form the national army of Cambodia with a quadripartite
general staff.''
   Sihanouk also wants an international conference under the
auspices of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar convened
as soon as possible to guarantee the neutrality of Cambodia,
supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops and organize free
elections.
   Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1978 and overthrew the
Khmer Rouge regime, which killed at least a million Cambodians in
its attempt to impose agrarian communism after gaining power in
1975.
   The four warring Cambodian factions and representatives from
Vietnam, Laos and the six members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations have been holding informal talks in Bogor since
Monday.
   Sihanouk, 65, quit as leader of the anti-Vietnamese coalition
this month and left leadership of his faction to his son, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh. But he agreed to visit Jakarta as a guest of
President Suharto.
   Leaders of the four factions made a pilgrimage to Jakarta today
to hear Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia from 1941 to 1970.
   He presented his proposals in English in a speech to Premier Hun
Sen, premier of the Vietnam-installed government in Phnom Penh;
Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge; Son Sann of the
anti-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front; and
Ranariddh.
   There was no immediate comment from the other factions, and
Sihanouk said the proposal had no better than a 50-50 chance of
being accepted. The plan was broad and lacked specific details.
   Representatives of the four factions met privately with him
before returning to Bogor.
   Sihanouk said the three-member coalition manages to stick
together because they hate Vietnam slightly more than each other.
   ``It is certainly handy to make Vietnam assume alone the
responsibility for our miseries and humiliations,'' he said. ``But
it is not less true that some Khmer factions are equally heavily
responsible for these miseries and humiliations.''
   Sihanouk has rejected the latest peace plan from the
Vietnam-backed government.
   Many Cambodians remain deeply suspicious of Vietnam's motives
despite Hanoi's promise to withdraw all occupation troops by the
first quarter of 1990. Many also fear a return to power by Pol Pot
of the Khmer Rouge, the strongest member of the coalition.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said a consensus was
developing at Bogor that the troop withdrawal should be linked with
steps to ensure that the Khmer Rouge do not regain power.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer's mother announced
her candidacy for the congressional seat once held by her son.
   ``I can be very calm and cool and quiet and unassuming, but all
the time I'm listening. But you get me riled up, I'm riled up,''
64-year-old Adeline Roemer said in her announcement Tuesday.
   On Monday, a 27-member committee of influential 4th
Congressional District Democrats refused to endorse anyone after
interviewing Mrs. Roemer and two other prospective candidates.
   Mrs. Roemer said she planned to file today.
   She will face incumbent Rep. Jim McCrery in the Oct. 1 open
primary. McCrery, a Republican, won a special election last spring
for the vacancy created when Roemer became governor.

<HEAD>Missing Woman Believed Victim of Voodoo Obsession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disappearance of a married woman has
led police on a search through the subculture of voodoo practiced
by her lover who may have killed her, then tried to ward off her
spirit with bizarre talismans, authorities said.
   The body of Caroline M. Rubia has never been found, but an
occultist contacted by police theorizes the 52-year-old woman was
buried in a grave beneath a crude cross, the victim of her jealous
lover's suicidal obsession with the primitive religion.
   Rubia, a telephone company administrator who disappeared June 2,
was likely killed by her lover of 20 years, a 47-year-old roofing
contractor who changed his name in 1979 from Charles William Turner
to Che Francois Toussaint, police said Tuesday.
   Toussaint was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning June 7
when investigators broke into his barricaded home in a San Jose
suburb expecting to find Rubia's body.
   Investigators found a crude altar in his closet along with items
including three snapshots of Rubia covered with salt and three
one-quart jars turned upside down with a strip of tape labeled
``Me'' on one, a second labeled ``Carol Rubia'' with ``Stop it!''
written underneath and a third reading ``Carol and I.''
   These, other items and desperate letters mailed by Toussaint
before his suicide blaming Rubia and her ``witchcraft'' for his bad
health and business failures sent investigators to a voodoo expert
in Berkeley, whom investigators did not identify.
   The expert, a self-described ``good witch,'' said the items are
those used in voodoo, an African-born religion based on a belief in
sorcery. Toussaint probably buried Rubia in a way that would
prevent her spirit from escaping the grave, which would likely be
covered with salt and pins, the expert told police.
   ``Salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined, even in death,
and that's why the expert was sure she was tied, too,'' said
Detective Sharon Young of the San Jose police department's missing
persons unit.
   The jars, molasses and spices in the closet were supposed to
seal in bad spirits and prevent them from attacking Toussaint, the
expert told police.
   ``He wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds,''
Young said.
   Other clues indicated Rubia had been killed, police said. Her
bloody prescription glasses were found in Toussaint's pickup truck
after he committed suicide. He had told friends that he would kill
Rubia if she tried to end their affair, and in her diary she
described how he had beat her, once nearly to death.
   Rubia attended a Catholic retreat shortly before her
disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote
herself to her husband and family, Young said.
   The evidence indicated Toussaint and Rubia had a stormy
relationship during which Toussaint had other lovers.
   ``They were very much in love,'' said Young. ``You should see
their love letters. They both were very jealous of each other. They
fought all the time because he wanted to be the boss. But she was a
strong and feisty woman.''

   Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old Vanderbilt heir
who committed suicide last week, was remembered by family and
friends as a graceful, honorable young man who had a brilliant
future.
   ``You're out of pain and with our father now,'' Cooper's
brother, Anderson Cooper, 20, said in a eulogy Tuesday at St. James
Episcopal Church. ``My father ... wanted us to be honorable men ...
Carter was an honorable man.''
   Among the 100 people at the funeral was First Lady Nancy Reagan,
who embraced Cooper's mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, after the service.
The women are old friends.
   Cooper, who had been under treatment for depression, jumped to
his death Ms. Vanderbilt's 14th-floor apartment Friday while she
stood helplessly nearby, police said.
   Cooper, the son of the late Wyatt Cooper, graduated last year
from Princeton University and worked as a magazine writer and
editor.
   ``He had a brilliant future,'' said Malcolm Forbes, who had
given Cooper a job at one of his magazines.
   Cooper, the third of Ms. Vanderbilt's four sons, was buried in
the family's 102-year-old plot at the Moravian Cemetery on Staten
Island.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, known for the fashion blue jeans that bear her
name, is the great-great granddaughter of railroad and shipping
magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt.

   Terrorists who attacked a Greek cruise
ship and killed nine people used two automatic weapons that had
been sold to Libya, police said.
   One gun was found aboard the liner City of Poros after the July
11 attack, and the other was found in the wreckage of a car that
blew up a few hours before the attack, killing its two occupants,
said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The source said Tuesday that the guns were Italian-made Berettas
that had been sold to Libya, which has been linked to international
terrorism.
   Government officials, also speaking privately, said the weapons
were Berettas but that they were initially sold to Belgium.
   Police have linked the car explosion to the cruise ship massacre
and speculate that the vehicle contained explosives and weapons to
be used in a hijack attempt.
   They theorize that the attack was a bungled attempt to force the
release of Palestinian Mohammed Rashid, sentenced July 13 to seven
months for entering Greece on a forged passport. Greece is
considering a U.S. request for his extradition on charges of
planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am jetliner in 1982.
   Rashid appeared in court Tuesday for an identity check that was
immediately postponed. A new hearing was set for Aug. 2 after
Rashid, 39, said he wasn't briefed on details of his case, a
judicial spokesman said.
   Rashid says his real name is Mohammed Hamdan and told reporters
at the court that ``the Greek police arrested the wrong man.''
   The hearing before an appeal court prosecutor was a routine
procedure in cases where mistaken identity is claimed, said the
judicial spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Palestinian was arrested May 29 at Athens Airport by police
acting on a tip from the American Embassy. He was carrying a forged
Syrian passport in the name of Mohammed Hamdan.
   But a fingerprint check showed him to be Rashid, who was jailed
in Greece from 1973-76 on narcotics smuggling charges, police said.
   Rashid also is accused of bombing a TWA jetliner over Greece in
April 1986. Four people, including a baby girl, died when the
explosion blasted them out of the plane.

   Iran's powerful Parliament speaker
offered to try to have American hostages held in Lebanon freed in
exchange for Iranian assets frozen in the United States, but the
White House said, ``No deals.''
   ``If (President) Reagan were sincere he ... would release the
Iranian assets,'' Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
today quoted speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying.
   ``I have said that once he does so then we will use our leverage
in Lebanon and help solve the issue of hostages,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Rafsanjani, who also is
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, spoke in a battlefront
interview Tuesday.
   Nine Americans are believed held in Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremists.
   ``So long as America keeps its hostile attitude toward Iran,
there will be no sign of any changes and there will be no
negotiations,'' Rafsanjani said Tuesday in a television interview
monitored in Nicosia.
   He said that one indication of good will would be releasing
Iranian assets in the United States.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters: ``No deals. The clearest signal they could send is to
release the hostages.
   ``We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we are
concerned you just can't link the two,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rafsanjani, considered the second most powerful figure in the
Iranian government after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, did not
refer to any specific Iranian assets in the United States.
   But he said the Iranian government paid the United States for
goods not delivered before the Islamic revolution toppled the
government of the late Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Rafsanjani probably was referring to military equipment, but
they had no dollar figure.
   The United States broke relations with Tehran and put a hold on
its U.S. assets after Iranians stormed the U.S. Embassy and took 52
Americans hostage. They were released in January 1981 after 444
days in captivity.
   As part of the release agreement, the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal
was set up in the Hague, Netherlands, and charged with arbitrating
billions of dollars of U.S. and Iranian financial claims arising
from the Iranian revolution.
   By 1987, the tribunal had awarded about $1 billion to American
claimants and about $60 million to Iranians, plus an undetermined
amount of interest to claimants on both sides.
   In May, three French hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems were released after the French government reportedly
agreed to repay a $1 billion loan to Iran.
   Nine Americans are among the 18 foreigners missing and believed
held hostage in Lebanon by Shiite Moslem extremists. The longest
held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   Anderson, 40, was abducted in Moslem west Beirut on March 16,
1985.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said:
``The problem of hostages in Lebanon is a question relating to the
Lebanese. It is not our question (problem).
   ``But on the basis of humanitarian aspects, we will do our best,
as we have done until now. And we do hope that all innocent people
as hostages in Lebanon or any place in the world could be released
very soon.''
   Velayati was in New York to discuss with U.N. officials a
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. He met twice Tuesday with
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   In an interview on the state-owned French television network
Antenne-2 on Tuesday, Perez de Cuellar said recent efforts toward
peace ``create a favorable atmosphere'' for the hostages held in
Lebanon.
   He said he planned ``to ask Iran to offer its good offices to
prompt the freeing of the hostages. It is not the first time I have
made an appeal for them to help.''
   But he said, ``No one can affirm that it is Iran who is
responsible'' for the fate of the 18 men still held in Lebanon.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, contacted at her home in Cadiz,
Ky., said: ``I think everything that's coming out of the Middle
East and U.S. is encouraging.''
   ``There seems to be a reaching out for communication. If Terry's
captivity and the captivity of the other Americans is to mean
anything it would hopefully be a movement toward peace in the
Middle East.''

   A salvage team today raised the wreckage of the
fishing boat that collided with a navy submarine and found the
bodies of all but one of the missing passengers and crew, coast
guard officials said.
   Discovery of the 20 bodies in the ship's lounge and cabins
raised to 29 the confirmed death toll from Saturday's collision,
the officials said. Forty-eight people, most members of a company
fishing club, had been on the chartered boat.
   Workers used a 230-foot crane to raise the hull to the surface
in pre-dawn darkness today near the mouth of Tokyo Bay. A hole was
visible in its bow just below the waterline.
   Coast guard ships brought victims' relatives to within a few
yards of where the boat, the No. 1 Fujimaru, was raised from a
depth of about 160 feet.
   Survivors, relatives of victims and newspapers charged that crew
members aboard the submarine stood by watching on the submarine's
deck while victims drowned. The submarine sustained little damage
and no injuries were reported among the 75 men on board.
   One survivor from the fishing boat told reporters the sub's
crewmen stared back as she waved and yelled, ``Why won't you help?''
   Of the 19 people rescued from the 154-ton fishing boat, which
sank in less than two minutes, 16 were picked up by other passing
vessels and only three by the submarine. One man died later in a
hospital.
   News reports said Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara offered
his resignation over the accident but will stay on until an
investigation is complete. Defense officials said they could not
comment on the reports.
   The status of Japan's military, officially called the
Self-Defense Forces, is still a sensitive issue after the military
excesses of World War II.
   The nation's constitution officially bars the maintenance of all
``war potential,'' and sharp public criticism usually follows any
accident for which the Self-Defense Forces is responsible.
   News reports suggested the captain of the submarine, the
2,200-ton Nadashio, may have erred just before the collision.
   The accident occurred as the submarine, traveling on the
surface, was cutting across a busy shipping lane to enter Yokosuka
naval base, shared by the Japanese and U.S. navies.
   Japanese maritime rules say the vessel approaching from the left
must take evasive action when on a collision course with another
ship, while the second ship must maintain its direction. But Kyodo
News Service and NHK television reports quoted the fishing boat's
surviving crew as saying the Nadashio, on the left, honked at the
fishing boat to warn it out of its path.
   Just before the crash, both ships turned in the same direction,
and collided almost head-on.
   ``As captain of the ship, I did my best until the last minute to
avoid a collision according to maritime collision prevention
laws,'' Manji Kondo, the 30-year-old captain of the fishing boat,
told a televised news conference late Tuesday.
   Admiral Shuichiro Higashiyama, navy chief of staff, told
reporters today he believes the submarine's crew took proper
measures to avoid the accident.
   But he said ``appropriate actions would be taken'' against any
officials found responsible for the accident in the final judgment
by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency.
   It was the worst collision between Japanese navy and civilian
vessels since World War II, defense officials said.

<TEXT>
   A woman who won the nation's admiration for her
bravery as rescuers worked to pull her from under a collapsed
35-ton crane has settled a lawsuit for nearly $10 million for the
accident that crushed her legs.
   Under terms disclosed Tuesday, 52-year-old Brigitte Gerney will
receive $1 million immediately, then $27,625 a month for a year,
then the same monthly payment for the rest of her life with a
compounded 3 percent increase each year.
   Mrs. Gerney could not be reached for comment. Her attorney,
Robert Conason, would not disclose her whereabouts.
   ``She's relieved it's over and wishes it never happened,'' he
said. ``She wants to be a productive, private person.''
   A former police officer who pleaded with her to hang on for her
life the day of the accident said the money cannot make up for the
tragedy.
   ``You can't put a price on the pain and agony she went through
and must go through. She's had a tragic life but has the spirit to
bounce back,'' said retired Detective Paul Ragonese.
   Mrs. Gerney was injured while returning from a dental
appointment shortly around noon on May 30, 1985. The crane,
operated by an unlicensed worker, fell on her legs as she passed
the site where a 42-story apartment building was being built.
   ``I heard all the bones cracking,'' Mrs. Gerney testified at the
trial of Lino Palmieri, the site foreman, and his employer,
Crimmins Construction Co. ``I screamed for help. `Help me! Help me!
Get me out!'''
   Mrs. Gerney testified that she lay beneath the crane for six
hours, in agony and with her legs crushed, and that at one point,
she asked for a priest because she thought she was dying.
   She underwent at least seven operations on her legs. President
Reagan called her during her recovery and Nancy Reagan visited.
Mayor Edward I. Koch threw a party for her when she left the
hospital.
   In 1986, she was walking on crutches at the criminal trial.
Today, she can walk without crutches.
   The settlement of the lawsuit against Crimmins, the city and
others, was reached after a session Monday in the courtroom of a
New York trial judge, David B. Saxe.
   The money is to be paid to Mrs. Gerney, a widow, through an
annuity the defendants are setting up with an insurance company.
   If she dies, her estate will receive the money for at least 20
years. The total would be $9,906,738, said Conason.
   The lawsuit was filed shortly after the criminal case ended in
spring 1986.
   Palmieri, 54, was fined $5,000, put on five years' probation and
ordered to perform community service for allowing an unqualified
person, Richard Ricciardi, to operate the crane. Crimmins
Construction was fined $10,000.
   Ricciardi, 31, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, was
sentenced to a few months in jail and placed on probation.

<TEXT>
   South Korean legislators today
accepted a North Korean plan for talks on a non-aggression pact and
on clearing the way for the north to take part in the 1988
Olympics, officials said.
   South Korean National Assembly officials said representatives of
the top four political parties and Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun
agreed to accept the North Korean offer and planned initial
contacts in the second week of August.
   ``The south is ready to take up the Olympic issue and does not
want to limit the agenda,'' one aide said on condition of anonymity.
   Party leaders must approve the plan, but officials said this
would be automatic and that a positive response would be sent to
North Korea on Monday.
   South Korean officials said they want preliminary talks at the
border truce site of Panmunjom to work out terms for the talks.
   North Korea last week asked South Korea for talks between their
legislatures on drawing up a pact to end the long rivalry between
the two nations. North Korea called for the first round to be held
in its capital, Pyongyang.
   The north said in a second letter Tuesday that it also was ready
to discuss entering the Olympics in Seoul in September on condition
that its demand to co-host the Olympics be discussed.
   The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have refused
to let the north co-host the Olympics because the Games are awarded
to a single city. The north has said it will boycott the Games if
it cannot co-host.
   South Korean Olympic officials, also speaking privately, said
the refusal to allow a co-host had not changed. They said the north
appeared to be setting co-hosting as a condition so that any new
talks probably would be inconclusive.
   Three previous rounds of talks between the south and north on
easing tension and establishing relations ended in failure. The
north broke off the most recent talks in 1986.
   A North Korean decision to take part in the Olympics without
co-hosting would be a drastic turnabout. The north sees the south's
hosting of the Olympics as a major political defeat in the struggle
between the two nations for supremacy.
   The two governments refuse to recognize each other and claim to
be the sole legitimate government on the Korean peninsula. The
peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Soviet forces at the end
of World War II and remained divided after the 1950-53 Korean War.
   South Korea and other nations fear the north may resort to
terrorism to disrupt the Olympics if it cannot co-host the Games.
   The north, which has attacked the south repeatedly, was blamed
for the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma with
all 115 people aboard killed. North Korea denied any involvement in
the attack.
   North Korean hopes for a boycott of the Olympics by communist
nations collapsed when the Soviet Union and China agreed to send
teams to Seoul. A record 161 nations are taking part in the Games.
   Only Cuba and Ethiopia have backed North Korea's demand to
co-host the Olympics.

<TEXT>
   Iran said it launched an attack on Iraqi
forces in southern Iran today, and commander-in-chief Hashemi
Rafsanjani predicted victory.
   ``The able combatants of Islam, in order to chase and destroy
the aggressive Iraqi forces on a greater scale, early this morning
attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north
of Khorramshahr,'' said an announcer who broke into regular
programs on Tehran radio.
   At the United Nations, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
accused Iraq of trying to sabotage peace efforts with attacks he
said involved the ``large scale'' use of chemical weapons.
   Velayati met twice Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. The Iranian and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq
Aziz, were to meet separately today with the U.N. chief.
   On Tuesday, Rafsanjani offered to try to have American hostages
held in Lebanon freed in exchange for Iranian assets frozen in the
United States, but the White House said, ``No deals.''
   Eighteen men, including nine Americans, are believed held in
Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists.
   Iraqi-backed Iranian guerrillas opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini said Tuesday they pushed deep into Iran, and Tehran
acknowledged its forces were fighting ``counter-revolutionary
mercenaries.''
   Iraq this week announced its forces were withdrawing from the
area just north of Khorramshahr, an Iranian port city, but Iran
continued to claim the Iraqis were invading the area.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said today that at least 300 Iraqis were killed or wounded in the
latest fighting in the area and dozens of tanks or armored
personnel carriers were destroyed.
   ``A complete brigade of the Iraqi army has been encircled by the
forces of Islam,'' said Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``In the course of the victorious battle this morning ...
numerous units of the enemy in this region were caught by surprise
and they are in a state of evident confusion'' in a strip of land
close to the border, the radio said.
   Rafsanjani said Iran's decision last week to accept a U.N.
cease-fire call was ``a major political and cultural victory, which
fortunately will be followed by a military victory.''
   ``We are witnessing the complete defeat of the Iraqi forces on
the southern front as well as the western fronts,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani's comments were made Tuesday in a battlefront
headquarters interview, and portions were carried on Iranian
television and radio Tuesday night. IRNA provided additional
quotations from the interview today.
   ``Thus far we were defending ourselves while branded as the
warmonger party and the one which does not want peace,'' he said.
Iraq accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution shortly after it was
passed, but Iran waited a year.
   IRNA quoted Rafsanjani, who is also speaker of Parliament and
one of the most powerful men in Iran, as saying recent incursions
into Iran proved that Iraq did not want peace.
   ``The Iraqi regime by nature is aggressive and will launch
aggression any time it finds an appropriate place and feels
powerful,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani renewed his earlier calls for able-bodied Iranians to
rush to the war front to confront the Iraqi ``invasion.''
   IRNA said Iraqi warplanes bombed residental areas in the western
city of Ilam, but it said no reports were available on casualties
or damage.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, meanwhile, reported that Iraqi
air defenses shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane over the southern
front. Iran did not comment on the claim.
   Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels of the National Liberation Army said
Tuesday they marched deep into western Iran, taking the towns of
Karand and Eslamabad.
   Tehran radio acknowledged that Iraq ``made use of
counter-revolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and
to martyr the heroic men and women there.''
   The rebels said they were advancing on the provincial capital of
Bakhtaran. They said they overran Karand, 43 miles inside Iran, and
Eslamabad, 18 miles farther; destroyed the 27th Revolutionary
Guards corps division and captured its garrison 95 miles east of
Iraq's border.
   But Iran said it recaptured Eslamabad and killed 1,100 rebels.
   The National Liberation Army is the military wing of the
Mujahedeen Khalq organization, an anti-Khomeini force that moved to
Iraq after its leaders were expelled from France in 1986. Its troop
strength is believed to range up to 15,000 men and women.

   Wildfires or not, Roehr
Guenter said he couldn't change his plans to see Yellowstone
National Park.
   The West German and his family were among the thousands of
tourists who continued flocking to the world-famous park this week
despite fires burning thousands of acres of forest and meadow.
   Even as smoke from the 6,000-acre North Fork fire billowed
behind the Guenters while they waited for Old Faithful to erupt,
they expressed enthusiasm about the 2.2 million-acre park and the
elk and bison they have seen.
   The fires appeared to have little effect on the number of people
entering the park. Last weekend, 41,346 cars entered the park,
comparable to 42,327 cars the previous weekend.
   Like many tourists, the Guenters changed their plans slightly
when they found the South Entrance to the park closed Sunday
because of fires burning in the Grant Village area.
   They drove their rental car back to Jackson, Wyo., then into
Idaho and through the park's West Entrance at West Yellowstone,
Mont.
   The closing of the South Entrance has been a boon to the tourism
business in eastern Idaho and western Montana.
   Ron Gray, resort manager at Mack's Inn at Island Park, Idaho,
has been ``turning people away at the door. It's unfortunate that
the fire is burning, but we've been full up.
   ``We've been renting rooms we usually would not rent, but people
say, `We'll take anything,''' Gray said.
   All accommodations in the park, campsites and hotel rooms, are
full, and space is scarce in West Yellowstone, said Steve Iobst, a
park spokesman. The fires have closed campgrounds in the Grant
Village and Lewis Lake areas.
   Motels and campgrounds in West Yellowstone have been having a
record year, and the closure of Grant Village in the park when fire
threatened it filled any vacancies there might have been.
   ``We've been solid booked for a week,'' said Becky Gillory of
the West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce.
   Bob McPherson of Seattle said the fires seemed to add ``a little
confusion'' to the traffic, but found the blazes ``kind of
dramatic, really.'' He said he would not change his plans to spend
the last three days of his 30-day vacation in Yellowstone.

<HEAD>Peres Accuses Shamir's Party Of Sabotaging Efforts To End Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres accused his
right-wing adversaries of fanning the flames of the seven-month
Palestinian uprising by sabotaging a U.S. Middle East peace
initiative.
   Shouting broke out Tuesday in a closed-door meeting of the
Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee over differences on the peace
proposals of U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``If it weren't for the sabotage of the peace process, of the
Shultz initiative, by half the government, then maybe we wouldn't
be in the middle of the intefadeh,'' Peres said, using the Arabic
word for ``uprising.''
   But Likud bloc legislator Dan Meridor, a close associate of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, signaled flexibility about
negotiations on the future of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The daily Jerusalem Post today quoted him as saying in a speech
that even those who supported Peres' proposals for territorial
compromise should vote for Likud in the November election because
it would drive a harder bargain.
   ``We must send to the negotiations those who will get the best
results,'' said Meridor.
   ``Who do those who are concerned for Israel's security prefer to
send to negotiations _ those who want to get rid of the territories
or those who will insist on every square inch and get the best
compromise?''
   Meridor also was quoted as suggesting it may have been a mistake
to hold on to the Gaza Strip, which was captured from Egypt in 1967.
   Seven opposition parties filed motions of no confidence today in
Shamir's coalition government, some citing Shamir's failure to put
down the Palestinian rebellion. The motions were defeated.
   The two-hour foreign policy meeting degenerated into a shouting
match between Peres and Likud legislator Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a
former ambassador to Egypt.
   According to other lawmakers, Ben-Elissar called Peres a
``Bolshevik,'' referring to the Labor Party's socialist-leaning
ideology.
   Peres retaliated by shouting at Ben-Elissar: ``You're always
slandering! You act like a fascist!''
   Visiting Conservative rabbis stepped into the fray by urging
Israelis not to vote for religious parties, which have held the
balance of power between the two major blocs in recent years.
   ``The time has come for Israel to adopt the separation of
synagogue and state as practiced in America,'' said Rabbi Kassel
Abelson of Minneapolis, president of the 1,200-member Rabbinical
Assembly.
   More then 230 Palestinians have been killed since the
anti-occupation uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been
killed.
   Labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return
for peace, while Likud opposes any concessions to the Arabs.
   The two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984
coalition agreement was forged to break an election stalemate.
   Pollsters predict a tight race between Labor and Likud, with the
latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for Israeli
hawkishness in response to the Palestinian uprising.

   Strong thunderstorms rumbled over Oklahoma today and isolated
storms were scattered over the Southwest as severe storms which hit
the East with powerful winds and hail as big as golf balls began to
fizzle.
   Severe storms Tuesday afternoon scoured the middle Atlantic
Coast. Wernersville, Pa., was pelted by hail an inch in diameter.
In northern New Jersey, high winds yanked down trees and power
lines in Morris and Union counties.
   In Virginia, thunderstorms unleashed hail the size of golf balls
on Fauquier County and winds gusting to 60 mph in Clarke County.
Some roads in Washington D.C. were blocked by wind-downed trees and
debris.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms continued over the East today.
   Thunderstorms in Louisiana and eastern Texas on Tuesday
generated 1-inch hail and winds that downed trees and power lines.
   Unseasonably hot weather continued in the northwest and north
central United States, with eight cities reporting record high
temperatures for the date, including: Dickinson, N.D., with a high
of 100, breaking the record of 98 set in 1946; Salem, Ore., 103,
which tied the record set in 1939; andPortland, Ore., with a high
of 98, over 97 set in 1971.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
through much of New England and the middle and southern Atlantic
states, the central and southern Appalachians, the lower
Mississippi Valley and central Gulf Coast into Florida; showers and
thunderstorms through Oklahoma and northern Texas; and mostly sunny
skies from the Great Lakes to the central Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 80s or 90s across much of
the country; in the 70s along the central California coast,
northwest Washington state and northern New England; between 100 to
105 through the northern Plains, and from central Texas into the
Rio Grande Valley of Texas; from 100 to 110 degrees from the
Southwestern deserts through the central and northern valleys of
California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 55

<HEAD>Scientists Test Whether Shroud Dates From Time Of Crucifixion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oxford University scientists today tested
a fragment from the Shroud of Turin to determine if it dates from
the period of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
   The tests, using carbon-14 dating, were directed by Professor
Edward Hall, head of Oxford's research laboratory for archaeology
and the history of art.
   The 15-foot length of linen, bearing the image of a bearded,
crucified man, is venerated by believers who accept that it covered
Jesus' body in his tomb. Skeptics consider it a brilliant forgery
from medieval times.
   Dr. Michael Tite of the British Museum said he hoped to get a
date with a margin of error of 200 years.
   ``If 12th, 13th or 14th century, the result is perfectly clear
cut,'' Tite said.
   ``If we get a date of 100 to 300 A.D. or 200 to 400 A.D., one
would start being a bit edgy. Whatever result we come up with, one
still has the question of how the image got there,'' he said.
   Similar carbon tests have been done at the University of Arizona
and the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland.
   The American and Swiss findings are being kept secret until the
results of all three tests can be announced together, expected in
September from Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin.
   The Oxford scientists were sent three thumbnail-size fragments
of cloth and were not told which of the three was cut from the
shroud, which is kept in Turin Cathedral.
   Cosmic rays entering the earth's atmosphere create radioactive
carbon-14 atoms that are absorbed by all vegetation and thus become
part of any material with an organic base, like linen and cotton.
   The atoms decay at a known rate, making it possible to estimate
how long ago a material absorbed them.

<HEAD>Koch Says British Now Playing `Positive Role' in Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch says Irish-Americans who
``beat up the British'' for their role in Northern Ireland are
taking the easy way out.
   The mayor, back at City Hall Tuesday, defended remarks he made
in Dublin earlier in the day at the end of his five-day pilgrimage
for peace in Ireland with Cadinal John O'Connor.
   In Dublin, Koch had praised the ``good attitude'' of the
British, saying, ``I do not believe that they deserve the
castigation that any of us, myself included, have heaped upon them.
   ``I do not believe that the British are occupying forces,'' he
told reporters. ``My impression in Northern Ireland is that the
British are trying to play a constructive role.
   ``I think they're (in Northern Ireland) more from the point of
view of safeguarding the peace by preventing what, if these people
were Jewish, would be called a pogrom.''
   The comments brought an immediate negative reaction from
prominent local Irish-Americans, including Peter King, the Nassau
County comptroller who has visited Northern Island 11 times and was
the 1985 St. Patrick's Day Parade grand marshal.
   He called the mayor's remarks ``senseless and ridiculous'' and
said Koch was ``demonstrating an appalling ignorance and disregard
for the Catholic community of Northern Ireland.''
   Koch said he changed his mind about the British after learning
more about the recent accords between the governments of Britain
and the Republic of Ireland for settling problems between the
Catholic and Protestant factions in Northern Ireland.
   ``The easiest thing to do is to beat up the British,'' he said.
   ``They are responsible for the historical reasons for the
division of Ireland and Northern Ireland,'' he conceded. ``But, if
you put that aside and talk about what they are doing today ... I
came to the conclusion that the British today are playing a
positive role.''

   Leaders of two of the West Coast's most
violent gangs met with clergy in a hotel surrounded by police,
seeking to end bloody feuding that has contributed to more than 165
killings this year.
   ``The talks are going well,'' the Rev. Charles Mims said after
the first closed-door meeting Tuesday between four leaders each of
the Crips and Bloods, gangs depicted in the sensational crime film
``Colors.''
   Gang violence also was the target of a protest Tuesday night in
East Los Angeles, where hundreds of people conducted a candlelight
march.
   ``We won't live in fear,'' said the Rev. Gregory Boyle, who
organized the rally.
   Crips and Bloods leaders met with the ministers at a motel in
suburban Carson 15 miles south of here for about 90 minutes, then
agreed to meet again today and Thursday.
   As they met, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies from the
Operation Safe Streets gang detail cruised nearby streets and
watched from rooftops with binoculars.
   A news blackout on details of the meeting will continue until a
news conference scheduled for Thursday, said Mims, one of the
ministers in Los Angeles' Watts neighborhood who organized the
talks.
   The ministers arranged the negotiations in hopes the gang
leaders would find enough common ground to at least slow the pace
of killing.
   More than 165 people in the county have died in violence
attributed to street gangs this year. Last year, 387 people, many
innocent bystanders, fell victim to gang violence.
   Tuesday's rare face-to-face encounter among young people who
usually confront each other at gunpoint was triggered by concern
the killings had gotten out of control.
   ``They're tired of the violence and they're tired of being
used'' by drug dealers and other underworld figures, the Rev. James
Sterns of the Tabernacle of Faith Baptist Church said Monday.
   Last weekend, four people died and 16 were wounded in Los
Angeles area gang attacks.
   Members of the Bloods and the Crips are mostly black, inner-city
youths and young adults. Police blame the two gangs for much of the
gang-related violence plaguing the nation's second largest city.
   Police Cmdr. William Booth said before the meeting that he hoped
the talks would have a ``settling influence'' on gang members who
control an arsenal of military assault weapons such as Uzi
submachine guns.
   Some civic leaders, however, expressed skepticism that a handful
of people could work out an agreement that would be the key to
peace for the nearly 300 black gangs citywide.
   ``This is a farce,'' said Chilton Alphonse, executive director
of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, which works with
gang members.
   Gang members should not expect ``to be treated like ambassadors
from warring nations, complete with television interviews and
surrounded by public officials,'' state Sen. Diane Watson of Los
Angeles said through a spokesman.
   The talks came as collective rage and frustration over the
violence mounted.
   In East Los Angeles, where Hispanic gangs dominate, hundreds of
parishoners from the Dolores Mission marched, holding candles and
singing in Spanish, ``We will walk these streets in peace.''
   The crowd, many of them children, held banners saying,
``Education and Jobs, Not Drugs.''
   The march was intended to serve notice not only to unwelcome
gang members but to outsiders seeking drugs, Boyle said.
   ``The BMWs come Friday (during) rush hour. Men with white coats
with stethoscopes around their necks buy cocaine that is the
cheapest in Los Angeles,'' he complained.
   ``We've had a solid week of shootings,'' he said, adding some
residents believe they are safer sleeping in their kitchens than in
their bedrooms.
   Often, gang members launch their attacks from passing
automobiles. Many times the victims are children and bystanders
caught in a crossfire.
   In recent months, Los Angeles gangs have been trying to develop
a lucrative drug trade in cities as far away as Kansas City, Mo.;
Seattle, Denver and Tulsa, Okla., according to police in those
cities.
   Police here estimate gang membership in the county at 100,000.
   Law enforcement leaders were cautious in predicting the results
of the Carson talks.
   ``The task that these so-called gang leaders have set before
them will be difficult, but I don't know that it's impossible,''
said Assistant Sheriff Jerry Harper.

<HEAD>Account Opened To Raise Funds For Memorial To Stalin Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets can donate money to a special bank account
to build a memorial to the victims of late dictator Josef V.
Stalin, the Tass news agency reported today.
   Tass said account number 700454 was opened at the U.S.S.R.
Social Bank at the request of the weekly Literary Gazette newspaper.
   The fund drive aims ``to build a monument in Moscow to the
victims of Stalinist repressions,'' Tass said in a brief dispatch.
   The newspaper has published many articles over the past year
detailing repressions under Stalin, the Soviet leader from 1924
until his death in 1953.
   Western historians have estimated that as many as 20 million
Soviets died as a result of his political purges, mass deportations
and forced collectivization of agriculture.
   Tass said Literary Gazette reported that citizens writing in
support of a memorial to Stalin's victims had suggested ``without
exception'' that the fund-raising project be a public rather than a
governmental effort.
   ``A public committee, elected by a democratic method, will be
set up to manage the fund and to oversee the construction of the
memorial,'' the agency said.
   It gave no details of the account or the memorial likely to be
built from donations.
   Stalin's repressions have been exposed and criticized in many
articles in the Soviet media that have been published since
Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power three
years ago and began his campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness
about Soviet history and social problems.
   Some of the late dictator's political victims, like
revolutionary Nikolai I. Bukharin, have been officially
rehabilitated and reinstated into the party as a result of the
historical review.

   Love Canal, a symbol of environmental
disaster, will eventually be restored as a residential area, New
York's top environmental officer says.
   ``We have a vision that we can restore Love Canal to a vibrant
landscape again,'' state Environmental Conservation Commissioner
Thomas Jorling said Tuesday.
   More than 800 families left the 10-block area in 1978 when toxic
wastes from a former chemical dump were discovered seeping into
their homes. Although many homes closest to the dump were torn
down, some 175 families are awaiting the results of a state study
of whether their homes are habitable.
   Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod is expected to decide the
issue this fall. However, in one of the first indications from
state officials on the contents of the study, Jorling said the
neighborhood would not be left vacant.
   ``Our policy of remediation means restoring it to use,'' Jorling
said. ``How could we sustain the policy if we're going to keep it
off limits?''
   State and federal agencies have spent some $200 million
containing and monitoring the contamination, he said. The site has
been fenced off, a leachate collection and treatment facility built
and the landfill capped with a synthetic liner and clay.
   ``We have the problem abated,'' he said.
   Jorling did not discuss how the neighborhood could be restored.
He said that would depend on Axelrod's ruling.
   But Mayor Michael O'Laughlin, who accompanied Jorling on a tour
of the site, pointed to boarded homes and said, ``I see these
places being lived in.''
   O'Laughlin said many homes could be reopened because there was
no evidence of contamination. State and federal governments should
provide money to renovate the homes, he said.
   The landfill itself would probably remain off limits forever, he
said.
   Formers residents and some people who have remained in their
homes near the site were skeptical of the idea.
   ``I not sure they'll ever know what's safe and what isn't,''
said former resident Patricia Brown.

<HEAD>Protestant Extremists Claim Responsiblity for Killing IRA Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Protestant extremist group
has claimed responsibility for killing a member of the
predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army.
   In a statement Tuesday to Belfast media, the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force said it shot Brendan Davidson, 33, on Monday as he
answered a knock at his door by three men dressed as policemen.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed IRA, accused
police of collusion with the killers. Sinn Fein said a patrol of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
passed outside Davidson's home shortly before he was killed.
   ``This prompts us to believe there was collusion, not of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary as a whole but between individual members
of the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries,'' said Sinn Fein spokesman
Jackie Donnelly.
   The IRA, fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland and
unite the island, also said in a statement Tuesday night that it
paid its ``final tribute'' to Davidson by firing a volley of shots
on a street in the Ardoyne area of Belfast.
   The IRA has abandoned its tradition of firing a gun volley over
coffins of its members, a practice which had led to confrontations
with security forces.
   Davidson's killing was believed to be in retaliation for an IRA
bombing Saturday near the Irish border that killed a Protestant
couple and their 6-year-old son.
   The IRA apologized for the attack, saying the bomb had been
targeted at security forces.

   Attorneys for Audi and the plaintiffs countered Tuesday that
they had mailed out 345,000 notices of the settlement and only
1,500 people said they would not agree to it.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowsky set a new hearing on
the proposed settlement for Aug. 11.
   In June, attorneys announced the proposed settlement, under
which Audi would offer rebates of $300 to $2,000 to 390,000 current
or former owners who buy another Audi. Under the settlement, Audi
acknowledged no liability.
   The settlement would affect owners of Audi 5000 sedans built
between 1978 and 1986.
   The Center for Auto Safety contends that at least 1,650
accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths, have been linked
to acceleration surges when the Audi 5000 was shifted from park
into gear.
   Audi contends there was nothing wrong with the cars.

   Federal prosecutors for the first time have
brought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insider
trading.
   The lawyer, Alfred Elliott, 44, of Melbourne Beach, Fla., was
one of 12 people indicted Tuesday for alleged financial crimes.
   He is accused of making $680,000 in illegal profits using
information he obtained while a partner of the law firm Schiff,
Hardin & Waite in Chicago.
   ``This is the first time in history we've used the racketeering
statute in an insider trading case,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas.
   The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives
the government more power to seize illicit gains than other laws
prohibiting insider trading, the prosecutor said.
   Elliott is charged with wire fraud, securities fraud,
racketeering and filing a false income tax return.
   If convicted on all counts, he could receive up to 363 years in
prison and $13.5 million in fines and be forced to make restitution
of any illegal profits.
   ``In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as a
powerful weapon in these cases,'' Valukas said.
   Nine times in 1984 through 1986, Elliott learned of large
pending stock acquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in the
company whose stock was being bought, the government said.
   The deals involved stock in Portec Inc., Pearle Health Services
Inc. and Rival Manufacturing Co., prosecutors said.
   Directory assistance for Melbourne Beach had no listing for
Elliott. His former law firm said it had no knowledge of his
whereabouts.
   Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday are accused in a
separate $1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, in which brokers
trade on customers' accounts merely to generate commissions.
   ``None of the 120 customers, most of whom were solicited by
telephone, ever made a profit,'' said Valukas.
   The government said the alleged scheme was carried out by
officers and employees of Whitehall Investors International Inc.,
based in Chicago with branches in Irvine, Calif., and Boca Raton,
Fla.
   Those indicted include Walter S. Josten, an owner and president
of Whitehall, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted.
   Three independent traders also were indicted in an investigation
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They are accused of
participating in fraudulent trading involving Jeffrey G. Donnelly,
a former broker with CRT Services Inc. Donnelly pleaded guilty to
fraud in February and was sentenced to three years in prison.
   The government said Donnelly took successful trades he executed
for his company and make it appear they had been made for one of
the three traders.
   Valukas said more than $700,000 was illegally diverted to the
defendants, while Donnelly got a 35 percent cut.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sein Lwin, a former army general who
ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the past quarter century,
today was named president of this troubled Southeast Asian nation.
   Sein Lwin, who replaces 70-year-old San Yu, on Tuesday assumed
the country's most powerful position _ chairman of the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party.
   An emergency session of Parliament today also elected the former
deputy prime minister and planning minister, Tun Tin, as prime
minister. Vice President Aye Ko remained in his post.
   Parliament also promoted Defense Minister Kyaw Htin to the No. 3
government position as head of the Council of State, which the
64-year-old Sein Lwin had vacated.
   It also endorsed a package of economic reforms proposed at a
recent party congress.
   The former party chairman, Ne Win, retired after leading Burma
for 26 years. The presidency is the No. 1 government post.
   The elevation of Sein Lwin and other leadership changes appeared
to dash any hopes that Ne Win's retirement would lead to reform of
Burma's one-party, military-backed regime.
   But Kyaw Htin and Tun Tin both are regarded as relatively
liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in
the country. Kyaw Htin also moved up to a top party post.
   Only one civilian was included in the new lineup, Attorney
General Dr. Maung Maung. The rest are retired or active duty
military officers.
   Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon and Bangkok, Thailand,
without exception expressed dismay over Sein Lwin's selection and
several predicted a continuation of student demonstrations.
   Shortly after the announcement of Sein Lwin's selection as
chairman, state radio said Prime Minister Maung Maung Kha and
Attorney General Myint Maung had been dismissed from their posts by
the Council of State after being found reponsible in connection
with bloody riots in March.
   Sein Lwin, a close associate of Ne Win, commanded forces that
brutally put down the March student riots, according to reliable
Western diplomatic and Burmese sources.
   He has since been the target of criticism by students and other
anti-government elements. More than 100 people were believed killed
in a brief flare-up in Rangoon on March 18.
   Several other officials have been fired or reprimanded, but Sein
Lwin escaped officially unscathed by the incident.
   The government has admitted that 43 people died, 41 of them
suffocating in a packed police van while being transported to
prison.
   Sein Lwin, who had ranked No. 4 in the party hierarchy, also
commanded the Fourth Burma Rifles, which opened fire on some 2,000
anti-government demonstrations at Rangoon University July 7, 1962.
Unofficial casualties were put at more than 100 and the following
day authorities blew up the university's student union building.
   Sein Lwin, who had served as the party's joint general secretary
since 1985, was also involved in putting down demonstrations in
1974. Students and Buddhist monks, angry at a shoddy government
funeral for former United Nations Secretary General U Thant,
snatched his coffin and brought it to the Rangoon University
campus, which was later stormed by rifle-firing troops.
   Ne Win asked to step down on Saturday. The congress accepted his
resignation and that of party Vice Chairman San Yu on Monday.
   In his resignation speech Ne Win raised hopes that major changes
were in store for Burma. In an unprecedented move, he called for a
referendum to decide whether the country wished to perpetuate
one-party rule or opt for a multi-party system.
   The congress turned down the referendum proposal and criticized
recent unrest. Although Ne Win assumed indirect responsibility for
the troubles in March and another outburst of anti-government
violence in June, he warned that when army is called out it
``shoots to hit: it does not fire in the air to scare.''
   Ne Win's resignation and the ensuing leadership changes follows
three periods of student-led rioting since last October in Rangoon
and other Burmese cities. There is also mounting discontent over
deteriorating economic conditions.
   The congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms but
there has been an initial skepticism among diplomats about how far
these will go and whether the current leaders can implement them
even if they try.
   ``This doesn't look like a strong enough team to carry out
economic reforms,'' one Western diplomat in Bangkok said after Sein
Lwin's election to the party chairmanship.
   Burma's economy suffered greatly under Ne Win's isolationist
policies. Inflation is soaring and the country has a foreign debt
of $4 billion.
   Burmese consumers rely almost solely on black market goods
smuggled in from neighboring countries.
   The government's tight control over agriculture and virtually
all economic sectors has turned resource-rich Burma into one of the
world's 10 poorest countries that last year suffered food shortages.

<HEAD>Rain Forces Early Closure Of Festival Of London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London's rainy summer has forced organizers to
close the elaborate Festival of London after only four days. It was
scheduled to run 16 days.
   Director and spokesman Tim Walsh said Tuesday that heavy rain
kept crowds away from the festival at Alexandra Palace, an
exhibition and concert center in north London. He said the rain
left Alexandra Palace park muddy and made it difficult to stage
many events.
   The night before the festival opened, wind almost wrecked a
specially built arena.
   Prince Edward opened the $3 million festival Saturday. It was
hailed as London's most ambitious event of this sort since the
Festival of Britain in 1951, which was held to demonstrate British
economic and technical progress.
   ``The Festival of London company has gone into voluntary
liquidation,'' Walsh said. ``The decision was made at a directors'
meeting this evening because attendance figures were so
disappointing and because of the weather.''
   He said it was too soon to assess the extent of losses but that
they would be substantial. He said most people who had formal
contracts with the company had been paid, including many
performers, and the company would do its best for the others.
   The festival was financed privately by a consortium of about 15
shareholders involved in the entertainment or allied industries.
   Its 200 planned events included a marathon race, reconstruction
of an Elizabethan village and Victorian streets and performances by
the Soviet Union's Moscow State Circus.
   All festival events scheduled after Tuesday were called off,
except for the circus, which will continue in its own tent in
Alexandra Palace park.
   ``It is a tragedy for London. This was the first year, and we
wanted to create a unique event for London which could have been
held annually,'' Walsh said.

   Iran said its forces drove Iraqi troops
out of southern Iran today and fought Iraq for control of a town in
western Iran. Tehran claimed 1,200 Iraqis were killed or wounded.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported Iraqi forces shot down
an Iranian F-5 warplane over the southern front. Iran did not
comment on the claim, but said its military shot down two Iraqi
warplanes.
   The fighting occurred as officials from both countries were to
meet separately in New York today with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to discuss a cease-fire in the 8-year-old
war.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it has captured 12,207 Iranians in six
days of fighting. Baghdad has sought to improve its bargaining
position in the talks by capturing an equal number of prisoners as
Iran claims to be holding.
   If today's claim by Iraq is confirmed, Baghdad now holds 25,000
Iranian prisoners of war compared to 50,000 Iraqi POWs held by
Iran, according to the latest International Red Cross estimates.
   The Iranian commander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani, offered
Tuesday to try to have American hostages held in Lebanon freed in
exchange for Iranian assets frozen in the United States, but the
White House said, ``No deals.'' Eighteen men, including nine
Americans, are believed held in Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
extremists.
   Iran said its forces attacked Iraqi troops occupying part of
southern Iran today, drove them across the border and killed or
wounded 1,200 Iraqis.
   Iran also said Iraqi troops again entered Eslamabad in western
Iran, and a battle of ``utmost intensity'' was under way for
control of the area.
   Earlier, Iraqi-backed Iranian guerrillas opposed to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini said they pushed deep into Iran, and Tehran
acknowledged its forces were fighting ``counterrevolutionary
mercenaries.''
   A Tehran radio announcer broke into regular programs to say:
   ``The able combatants of Islam, in order to chase and destroy
the aggressive Iraqi forces on a greater scale, early this morning
attacked the core of the enemy forces in the operational axis north
of Khorramshahr.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, gave the casualty figure of
1,200 and said a brigade of the Iraqi 3rd Army Corps was encircled
and ``destroyed'' in the fighting for control of an area just
inside the Iranian border.
   The report said Iraqi troops were ``driven back to the other
side of the international border'' and 12 square miles of Iranian
territory was ``liberated.''
   Iran's air force heavily bombed Iraqi troop concentrations
during the fighting, the radio said.
   Iraq earlier this week announced its forces were withdrawing
from the area just north of Khorramshahr, an Iranian port city, but
Iran continued to claim the Iraqis were invading the area.
   Rafsanjani said Iran's decision last week to accept a United
Nations cease-fire call was ``a major political and cultural
victory, which fortunately will be followed by a military victory.''
   ``We are witnessing the complete defeat of the Iraqi forces on
the southern front as well as the western fronts, and these have
prepared very favorable conditions for the armed forces of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to show their power and capabilities,'' he
said.
   His comments were made Tuesday in a battlefront headquarters
interview, and portions were carried that night on Iranian
television and radio. The Islamic Republic News Agency provided
additional quotations today.
   Rafsanjani renewed his earlier calls for able-bodied Iranians to
rush to the war front to confront the Iraqi ``invasion.''
   On Tuesday, the Iraqi-backed National Liberation Army claimed it
marched deep into western Iran, taking the towns of Karand and
Eslamabad. Tehran radio acknowledged that Iraq ``made use of
counter-revolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and
to martyr the heroic men and women there.''
   The National Liberation Army said its guerrillas overran Karand,
45 miles inside Iran, and Eslamabad, 20 miles farther, but Iran
said it recaptured Eslamabad, killing 1,100 rebels.
   Today, however, Tehran radio said ``Iraqi troops'' entered
Eslamabad in the morning. ``The battle in the region is continuing
with utmost intensity, and the initiative lies with the combatants
of Islam,'' said the radio.
   The National Liberation Army is the military wing of the
Mujahedeen Khalq organization, an anti-Khomeini force that moved to
Iraq after its leaders were expelled from France in 1986.

   Masked gunmen broke into a home during a
power blackout and forced the owner to hand over gold and currency
worth about $360,000, a newspaper reported today.
   The newspaper said it was the most money and gold ever taken in
the robbery of a private citizen in Poland.
   The robbery occurred Sunday night during a thunderstorm in
Bogucin, near the western city of Poznan, according to an account
in the daily Zycie Warszawy.
   The 71-year-old victim, described as a ``well-established market
gardener'' who owns greenhouses, was awakened shortly before
midnight Sunday by at least three masked robbers, who beat him and
fired at least one shot, the report said.
   They then forced the man to open his strongbox and turn over
gold, Western and Polish currency.
   The victim, who was not identified, has offered a reward of
$11,000 for any information leading to the robbers, according to
the account.
   Poland's greenhouse operators, who grow flowers, fruits and
vegetables, are among the country's most affluent businessmen.

   Riot police today arrested about 30
students yelling ``Yankee go home!'' and demonstrating in front of
U.S. Army headquarters to demand expulsion of U.S. forces.
   Hundreds of riot police in green fatigues and black visored
helmets detained the students as they marched toward the U.S. 8th
Army headquarters in southern Seoul. The students, who tried to
stage a peaceful sit-down protest, were forced into police buses.
   The dissidents also demonstrated to mark the 35th anniversary
today of the end of the Korean War, begun in 1950 by communist
North Korea's invasion of the south.
   About 1,000 students and dissidents later marched toward the
U.S. Embassy after a rally at Korea University.
   Thousands of riot police followed the march through the city and
blocked the students' way less than a mile from the embassy. There
were no clashes and police persuaded the protesters to move into a
nearby park.
   Forces from the United States and 15 other nations intervened on
the side of South Korea during the war and China fought alongside
the north. The war ended July, 27, 1953 in stalemate with the two
sides signing an armistice.
   The students called for removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops still
based in South Korea under a defense treaty, and they carried
banners denouncing the American military presence.
   ``Down with the United States, which forced partition of the
Korean peninsula,'' protesters shouted.
   Radical students claim the United States is responsible for the
continued division of the Korean Peninsula and rules the south as a
virtual colony. Radicals have called for immediate reunification
with the communist north.
   Most South Koreans fear the north remains determined to conquer
the south and are vehemently opposed to the totalitarian regime in
the north. The radicals have virtually no public support.
   The peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces that ended
the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.

   ``I can't say it's an arson,'' said Tom Brady of the police bomb

<TEXT>
   A military court today sentenced
three prominent Slovenian journalists to prison terms ranging from
five to 18 months for disclosing military secrets, a supporter of
the accused said.
   An army sergeant-major who allegedly leaked a classified
document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the
military court in Ljubljana, capital of Yugoslavia's most liberal
republic, Slovenia, said Donci Kuzmanic.
   Kuzmanic is a spokesman for The Committee in the Defense of the
Accused, an unofficial group supporting the defendants.
   The journalists, Janez Jansa, David Tasic and Franci Zavrl,
along with Ivan Borstner, the non-commissioned army officer, were
sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and
combat readiness of army units in the republic.
   Jansa, a columnist for the outspoken youth newspaper Mladina,
and Zavrl, chief editor of the same magazine, received 18 months
each, Kuzmanic told The Associated Press. He said Tasic, a
journalist working for Mladina, was sentenced to five months.
   The closed-door trial, which started July 11, sparked an uproar
in Slovenia, which has emerged as the vanguard of political reforms
in this communist country.
   More than 10,000 people gathered in front of the courthouse to
hear the verdict and protest the trial, witnesses said. They
carried banners and Slovenian national flags in support of the
defendants.
   Military trials of civilians are highly unusual in Yugoslavia,
where the armed forces, unlike the police and civilian courts, are
under federal control.
   All three journalists have in past written articles sharply
criticizing the Yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they
were plotting a coup in Slovenia.
   Thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed
petitions against the trial, widely seen in the republic an army
move to intimidate the Slovenian public.
   Zavrl, the only defendant not held in custody, regularly
commented on the trial publicly, saying it was ``a shameful,
humiliating court proceeding.''
   The liberal Slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be
conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers
and that they all be released from custody.
   The Slovenian leadership, along with numerous unofficial groups
and prominent intellectuals, also demanded that the court
proceedings be conducted in the Slovenian language, instead of
Serbo-Croatian, which is used by the majority of Yugoslavs.
   The army rejected all of the requests, citing what they said was
the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that
Serbo-Croatian is the official language of the armed forces.

<HEAD>Baffling Scientific Results Caused by Shoddy Science,
Investigators Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead, 13th graf, `The investigators...' to CLARIFY that
researchers were not hired by medicine company, but salaries were
paid by it under a contract arrangement with INSERM.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientific detective team repudiated research
results that seemed to defy natural laws, saying it was
``dismayed'' that the salaries of two of the researchers were paid
by a supplier of controversial medicines.
   The investigators, who included magician James (The Amazing)
Randi, concluded that ``shoddy science'' but no deliberate fraud
was responsible for the inexplicable biochemical results, said John
Maddox, editor of the British journal Nature.
   The prestigious science journal published the results last month
along with an unusual ``editorial reservation'' that noted the
``incredulity'' of experts and said that the lead researcher,
Jacques Benveniste, had agreed to the investigation.
   The investigating team's report, released Tuesday, was based on
a week-long visit this month to Benveniste's suburban Paris
laboratory, part of a French medical research institute called
INSERM.
   Benveniste said this week the investigators made ``an enormous
amount of mistakes,'' and in a written statement he called the
investigation ``a mockery of scientific inquiry.''
   The Nature report and Benveniste's statement will appear in
Thursday's issue of journal.
   At issue are results reported by Benveniste and a dozen other
scientists in the June 30 issue of Nature. The researchers studied
the reaction of white blood cells, called basophils, when exposed
to natural proteins called antibodies mixed into a solution.
   They said that when the solution was diluted so much that
samples of it no longer contained any antibodies, those samples
still triggered the reaction in the white blood cells.
   ``There is no physical basis for such an activity,'' Nature said
in its note accompanying the report.
   The investigators were Maddox; Randi, a recipient of a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius'' grant who is known for investigating unusual
scientific claims; and Walter Stewart of the National Institutes of
Health, who investigates scientific errors and fraud.
   In a telephone interview, Maddox said Randi was picked to look
for trickery, and Stewart because of his tenacity in investigating
scientific inconsistencies.
   During the week with Benveniste and co-workers, they studied
laboratory notebooks and observed repetitions of the experiment.
The notebooks and observed experiments showed that results were
inconsistent, the report says.
   The investigators, noting that the June 30 results have been
interpreted as supporting homeopathic medicine, said they were
``dismayed'' to discover that a French supplier of homeopathic
medicines paid the salaries of two of Benveniste's co-authors under
a contract with INSERM.
   Homeopathic medicine holds that a disease-causing agent, if used
in extremely dilute solutions, can be used to fight the disease.
Its principles are not accepted by many doctors.
   In a series of trials in which researchers followed special
procedures to ensure they could not influence the outcome, the
experiment failed to give positive results, investigators said.
   In one such procedure, investigators secretly devised a code
that identified the samples in each of a series of test tubes. The
identifications were enclosed in a specially sealed envelope, which
was then taped to the ceiling of the laboratory during the
experiment.
   The day after that was done, Randi said in a telephone
interview, the envelope showed evidence that someone had tried to
look at its contents. The attempt apparently failed, he said.
   Overall, the investigators concluded that the researchers paid
too little attention to preventing contamination and errors in
recording the response of the white blood cells.
   Researchers also failed to explore why the experiment gave
negative results on many occasions, and excluded data from such
failures in their published analyses, investigators said. In
addition, some past results appeared to be questionable,
investigators said.
   Benveniste blamed negative results on the procedures he said
were improperly imposed by the investigators and on overwork by
laboratory workers in the ``ordeal (that included) awful technical
and psychological conditions.''
   Maddox replied that the added procedures were ``perfectly
sensible'' and that the performance of lab workers showed no
evidence of decline.
   The June 30 paper also reported positive results from France,
Canada, Israel and Italy. The investigators said they knew too
little about the conditions of those experiments to evaluate them.

   A week's worth of payment receipts from nearly
12,000 Ohio Bell customers disappeared in transit somewhere between
the telephone company and its bank, according to baffled officials.
   The customers paid their phone bills at 90 National City Bank
branches in the Cleveland area during the first week of July, but
Ohio Bell doesn't know which customers to credit because the stubs
are lost, officials said Tuesday.
   The telephone company has received the money that the customers
paid through the bank, about $500,000, said Ohio Bell spokesman
Powell W. Caesar III.
   Asked what will happen if customers can't find their copies of
the payment stubs, Caesar said, ``We are confident every customer
who deserves a credit will receive it.''
   During the first two hours of business Tuesday, Ohio Bell's
residence service center received 1,371 calls _ about 200 more than
normal, Caesar said.
   David Talbott, National City vice president for public
relations, said Ohio Bell picks up the stubs daily at a designated
point at the bank's downtown headquarters.
   ``Those stubs came back downtown (from the branches), where they
were to be picked up by Ohio Bell,'' he said. ``They were not
picked up by Ohio Bell. What happened to them after that, we don't
know.''
   Caesar said the stubs generally are transferred from the bank to
Ohio Bell daily. He couldn't explain why a week's worth of stubs
disappeared before the problem was noticed.
   ``We have methods and procedures in order to pick up bill
payment stubs, but as far as the bank situation is concerned, we
are still determining what happened,'' Caesar said. He said Ohio
Bell believes the stubs were inadvertently destroyed.
   Talbott thinks most customers will be able to prove they paid
their bills and said the bank has records of all transactions.

<HEAD>Panel Says 16-Year-Olds Should Marry Without Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government advisory commision says 16-year-olds
in England and Wales should be allowed to marry without their
parents' consent.
   The Law Commission said Tuesday that the law requiring parental
consent for those under 18 who wish to marry can easily be avoided
by determined teen-agers. It said the current law is illogical and
should be repealed.
   ``It appears that the present consent requirement is ... of
doubtful benefit to the very children it is trying to help,'' the
commission report said.
   ``If the marriage takes place without consent, it is quite
valid. If consent is refused, the child can apply to the court for
consent, which is likely to be granted,'' the commission said. ``In
technical terms, therefore, it is difficult to justify the present
law.''
   The Law Commission comprises five legal experts headed by High
Court Judge Sir Roy Beldam. It was established by Act of Parliament
in 1965 to monitor the law and recommend changes.
   Its reports carry considerable weight but are not binding on the
government. Scotland is unaffected by the recommendation because it
has its own separate legal system.
   The commission report also said the present consent law does
little good, because teen-agers are increasingly living together
without being married.
   Cohabitation resulting from refusal of consent could be
``severely disadvantageous'' to the girl, it said, because courts
had less power to protect her than if she were married.
   ``Parental refusal to consent may simply serve to alienate the
child and, since parental opposition is often withdrawn if the girl
becomes pregnant, unwanted pregnancies may be encouraged,'' it said.

<DATELINE>CLARIDGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old was electrocuted when she
tried to knock a wire from an electrified fence off her mother's
leg, police said.
   A detective said a device that reduces normal household current
to a harmless level had been plugged in backwards, giving the fence
a lethal charge.
   Tara Zyhowski died Monday night in a field near her mobile home
in Penn Township, where she and her mother, Karen Zyhowski, were
collecting grass clippings to feed to horses, said township Police
Chief Edward Schmuck.
   Mrs. Zyhowski had tried pull a wagon containing the clippings
underneath a 2{-foot electric fence surrounding the pasture,
Schmuck said. A live wire snapped, coiled around her ankle and
knocked her down, he said.
   When Tara took off her thongs to use them to knock the wire off,
her right arm touched the wire, knocking her to the ground. Her
head then came into contact with the wire, said County Chief of
Detectives Michael Brajdich.
   With her head and arm both touching the wire, a circuit was
completed and she was electrocuted by the 100-volt current, he said.
   ``The little girl was obviously trying to help her mother, and
she told her to stay away,'' said Diane Kmetko, a friend of the
family.
   Roxanne Holmes, a family friend who arrived just after the
accident, went to the house and pulled the main plug to the fence.
   Gerry Mattern, an electrical engineer who examined the fence
after the accident in the western Pennsylvania community, said such
a fence normally would carry 40 to 45 volts, which causes no more
than a slight shock to a human.
   ``It's the kind of thing that shouldn't have done what it did,''
said Assistant District Attorney Alfred Bell.
   County Detective Michael Paden said a device known as a fencer
normally reduces the 110-volt, continuous household current to a
40-volt current pulsating in one-second intervals.
   But the plug was in backward, giving the line a lethal 105-volt
continuous current, he said.
   Dr. Cyril Wecht, the pathologist who performed the autopsy, said
most fatalities require more than 240 volts, but there can be
deaths at lower levels. ``There is a great variation when it comes
to children,'' he said.
   Mrs. Zyhowski suffered burns on her hands and legs. She was
listed in stable condition at Forbes Regional Health Center in
Monroeville.
   Paden said Tara was ``quite a hero as far as I'm concerned.''
   ``She was smart, too,'' he said. ``She tried to use the
rubber-soled sandals. The other witnesses told us she also warned
her 3-year-old sister and another child to stay away. That was
quite a feat for a 7-year-old.''

   A growing number of countries are enacting
discriminatory laws and travel restrictions to fight the spread of
AIDS, according to a Harvard study.
   ``We're seeing an increase in the use of coercion, quarantine
and criminal prosecution against AIDS victims,'' said Larry Gostin,
an associate professor at Harvard's School of Public Health. ``It's
becoming a syndrome of blaming the victims.''
   Gostin presented highlights of the study Tuesday at the 10th
National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum.
   Many of the laws are based on irrational fears that AIDS is a
``foreigners' disease'' and not a worldwide problem, according to
the study by the Harvard School of Public Health commissioned by
the World Health Organization.
   One of the countries with the greatest use of criminal statutes
and coercive measures to penalize AIDS victims is the United
States, said Gostin, also director of the American Society of Law
and Medicine.
   ``We found at least 50 criminal prosecutions of people with the
HIV virus and uncovered at least a dozen more statutes for
quarantine, isolation or criminal prosecution of people (in the
United States),'' he said.
   Cuba and the Soviet Union have among the toughest laws to combat
AIDS, according to the study. Cuba tests all returning citizens for
AIDS, including soldiers, and keeps 150 people in perpetual
quarantine.
   Soviet officials recently passed a law calling for compulsory
screening of all AIDS high-risk groups such as intravenous drug
users, homosexuals and prostitutes and may test foreign diplomats.
   The survey, which was sent to health officials in every country,
found that 45 percent of the 77 countries that responded have AIDS
legislation, the first time health officials around the world have
developed laws for just one disease, Gostin said.
   The study also found that 21 countries have established national
AIDS commissions or task forces, Gostin said.
   Most disturbing were the study's findings that 24 countries,
including Japan, China, Iraq, Libya, Soviet Union, Thailand and
Saudi Arabia, developed immigration and travel restrictions for
people with the HIV virus, Gostin said.
   When countries were last surveyed in 1985, none had such
restrictions, he said.
   ``Our fear is that we're seeing an AIDS war where countries are
blaming other countries and putting up border restrictions,''
Gostin said. ``This could all be part of passport and immigration
control in many countries.''
   Harvard officials recommended that countries ``view AIDS as a
global problem and not something to retaliate against.'' They also
urge countries to enact anti-discrimination and confidentiality
laws to protect AIDS victims.

<HEAD>Bush Begins Running Mate Search In Earnest; Dukakis Handles State
Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf, Kept close, with prison-site trip called off
because of heavy rain; minor editing in top 2 grafs</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis zeroed in on
law and order today after attacking the ethics record of the Reagan
administration. Vice President George Bush intensified his search
for a vice presidential running mate as the Republican National
Convention drew closer.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, began his
first solo campaign trip today with stops scheduled over the next
several days in Texas, New Mexico, California, Nevada, and the deep
South.
   The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee planned to address
a businesswomen's group in Albuquerque, three days after Bush went
before the group and unveiled a plan for a child care tax cut.
Bentsen said he would highlight his Senate accomplishments,
including prenatal and child care legislation.
   Kept close to his home base by official duties, Dukakis planned
to tour a prison construction site but called off the visit after
heavy rains turned the site into a muddy quagmire. Later, he was to
meet with with his anti-crime council and sign legislation imposing
stiff penalties on producers and sellers of child pornography.
   The Massachusetts governor is highlighting law-and-order themes
after coming under attack for his prison furlough program. After
some participants committed violent crimes during their release,
the program was revised.
   Bush on Tuesday stepped up his search for a running mate, and
expanded the list of possible candidates with the addition of New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. Sununu is chairman of the National
Governors' Association, one of five co-chairmen of the Bush
campaign, and a harsh critic of Dukakis.
   Bush asked Washington lawyer Robert M. Kimmitt to begin
background checks on several prospective nominees, The Washington
Post reported today.
   The winnowing process will include selective polling, said
Sheila Tate, Bush's campaign spokeswoman.
   Bush has said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until
the convention, which opens Aug. 15 in New Orleans.
   Dukakis, during an afternoon news conference Tuesday in Boston,
said the American people ``are embarrassed and ashamed by some of
the things that they see'' in the Reagan administration.
   He blasted President Reagan and Bush for supporting Attorney
General Edwin Meese III even after two Justice Department officials
quit because of the attorney general's conduct.
   Dukakis also renewed his criticism of Bush for not trying to
block the arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra
affair, and he questioned the viability of Bush's day-care proposal.
   ``A policy that would require every welfare mother in the
country to hire an accountant just doesn't make sense,'' he said.
Bentsen also criticized the proposal in an interview Tuesday,
saying, ``I don't know what the cost would be.''
   Bush this week proposed what he said would be a $2.2 billion
program that would give tax credits to working mothers, initially
targeting those with low family incomes.
   In a speech Tuesday, Bush broke with the Reagan administration
and endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate
wrongdoing by federal officials. He also said Congress should come
under the same law.
   He said civil penalties as well as criminal sanctions should be
used to punish violators.
   Bush said that under the current system, an official is charged
either with a felony or nothing at all. ``This is plainly
unacceptable,'' the vice president said.
   Jesse Jackson, a Democratic challenger until last week, met with
aides in Chicago to plan for a new phase in this year's political
activity. Jackson aide Frank Watkins said the transition of some
Jackson aides to the Dukakis campaign was discussed, but said no
specifics about Jackson's role had yet been decided.
   And a dispute over some Dukakis campaign funds turned out to be
short-lived. The Federal Election Commission voted 6-0 Tuesday to
release $46 million to the Dukakis campaign despite objections from
a Republican group. The group complained about Bentsen's dual
campaigns as Dukakis' vice presidential running mate and as a
senator seeking re-election from Texas.
   Positive reaction from the Democratic National Convention
boosted Dukakis in the polls, giving him a 17-point lead over Bush
in the latest Gallup survey of 1,001 registered voters conducted
Friday through Saturday.
   The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station WEEI in Boston,
found Dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for Bush. The
poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential
candidates after their nominating conventions.
   Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin of
error of four points.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen hiding behind a wall outside the
estate of convicted Mafia boss Michele Greco killed a reputed
mobster today as he approached one of the villa's gates, police
reported.
   Italian news agencies quoted police as saying Santo
Prestifilippo, 26, died immediately after being shot in the face
and chest with fire from sawed-off shotguns. The assassins fled.
   Prestifilippo was the sixth defendant involved in Italy's
largest Mafia trial to be assassinated since the trial ended last
December. He was one of 456 defendants in the nearly 2-year-long
trial in Palermo.
   Accused of criminal association, he was acquitted for lack of
evidence, a formula which under the Italian justice system is less
than full acquittal.
   Police theorize that various Mafia gangs are jockeying for power
after some of the Mafia's top men ended up in prison at end of
trial.
   Greco, nicknamed ``the pope'' for allegedly heading the Sicilian
organized crime group's executive ``commission,'' was convicted and
sentenced to life in prison by the Palermo jury.
   The court held Greco responsible for the murder of Gen. Carlo
Alberto Dalla Chiesa, gunned down a few months after being assigned
in 1982 by the Italian government as its special Mafia fighter in
Palermo.
   The first defendant to be killed after the trial ended was
gunned down only a few hours after the verdict. Earlier this month
the fifth defendant was assassinated shortly after being let out of
prison when his sentence was annulled because of technical
irregularities.
   The trial was billed as a key instrument in the state's stepped
up war against organized crime.
   President Francesco Cossiga this week ordered an inquiry into
allegations by a Sicilian-based investigating magistrate that the
state has lowered its guard against the Mafia and that police are
no longer delivering the kind of evidence magistrates need to seek
trial indictments against reputed mobsters.

   Twenty-six people have been charged
with selling sexually explicit T-shirts, and some questioned
whether anti-Semitism was involved in their arrest.
   Other questions were raised about why bail was set at between
$10,000 and $30,000 for each person and why reporters were barred
from the bail hearings.
   Steve Bates, executive director of the state's American Civil
Liberties Union, said the bail amounts were an ``outrage.''
   ``Jaywalking is more dangerous than these shirts,'' he said.
   Many of the beachwear store owners and operators arrested on
obscenity charges _ 21 on Monday and five more on Tuesday _ are
Jewish or are from Israel and said they think that was a factor in
their arrests.
   Mayor Bob Grissom called allegations of anti-Semitism
``ridiculous'' and said he hopes the arrests ``go a long way toward
cleaning things up and make these people aware that if they're
going to live here they're going to live by our rules.''
   Circuit Judge Don Rushing agreed to review the bail set by a
city judge at the request of a lawyer for several store owners. Six
remained in jail overnight Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas killed 18 Soviet
soldiers in a clash that left more Soviets dead than any battle
fought since the Red Army began withdrawing from Afghanistan,
Western diplomats said today.
   The diplomats also said guerrillas fired more than 150 rockets
into the Afghan capital of Kabul last week, damaging the French
Embassy and killing or wounding at least 50 people in the heaviest
shelling on Kabul in four years.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said one rocket smashed
into the right wing of the embassy complex Saturday night, damaging
the ambassador's residence and adjoining chancery but causing no
injuries.
   A ministry spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the windows of the buildings were blown out and the roof, kitchen
and laundry rooms suffered ``important damages.''
   The 18 Soviet soldiers were killed in the battle last week in
the province of Logar, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. No other details on the fighting were available.
Moscow, which had no comment on the report, has said that area of
eastern Aghanistan is no longer occupied by Soviet soldiers.
   The Red Army began withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15.
   The diplomats also said a Soviet convoy was ambushed last week
by Afghan guerrillas in the northern province of Jozjan bordering
the Soviet Union. Although Soviet soldiers were reported killed,
there were no casualty figures.
   The insurgents also have been attacking the Salang highway, the
only road linking Kabul and the Soviet Union, the diplomats said.
The guerrillas are ambushing Soviet convoys on the highway in
Parwan province and taking supplies intended for Hairatan on the
border with the Soviet Union, the sources said.
   The diplomats said the rocket attacks on Kabul have been
launched from positions around the city, suggesting the various
guerrilla factions are working together and moving closer to the
city.
   Although military installations have been targeted most often,
the diplomats said, civilian areas have also been heavily hit by
rockets.
   The April 14 United Nations accord providing for the withdrawal
of 100,000 Soviet soldiers, specifies that half be out by Aug. 15
and the rest by Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas, who did not sign the accord, say they will
continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier is out of
Afghanistan and the Soviet-backed Marxist government is overthrown.
   The Moslem insurgency began in 1978. Soviet troops entered
Afghanistan in 1979 at the request of the Moscow-backed Afghan
regime.

   The checks were among 805,000 totaling $105 million turned over

   An Armenian activist expelled from the Soviet
Union is in Ethiopia trying to arrange refuge in the United States
for himself and his family, a relative and a friend said today.
   The U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia said in a statement today that it
had started paper work to grant asylum to Paruyr Ayrikyan. An
embassy source said Ayrikyan's case was being given priority.
   Ayrikyan, a leader in the unsuccessful Armenian campaign to
annex an predominantly Armenian region of the neighboring republic
of Azerbaijan, was flown to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, a
week ago, the sources said.
   Ayrikyan was banished to Ethiopia last week and brought to the
Armenian community for help in resettling, another Armenian exile
told The Associated press by telephone from Addis Ababa.
   ``Everyone is helping him, there's no need to worry,'' said
Theresa Masras, an Armenian who left the Soviet Union 28 years ago
and is married to an Ethiopian businessman.
   She said Ayrikyan was not available at the time because he was
at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa trying to arrange a visa to the
United States.
   Ayrikyan called family members in Moscow late Tuesday night and
said he was in Addis Ababa, said his mother-in-law, Nina Sidorenko.
   Mrs. Sidorenko said Ayrikyan began a hunger strike to protest
his ``total isolation'' at the Ghion hotel in the capital of
Soviet-allied Ethiopia.
   But Mrs. Masras, who said she makes her permanent home in
Houston, Texas, said Ayrikyan was free and being well cared for by
fellow Armenians.
   Mrs. Sidorenko said Ayrikyan told her that on Tuesday he went to
the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   She quoted Ayrikyan as saying a Soviet diplomat in Addis Ababa,
Eduard K. Kolgin, assured him his wife, their three children and
other relatives wishing to accompany him in exile would be allowed
to leave the Soviet Union, she said.
   Mrs. Sidorenko said Ayrikyan told her he was taken from the
Armenian capital of Yerevan to Moscow on July 20 and kept overnight
at Lefortovo Prison. Ayrikyan said Soviet agents accompanied him
the next day on a direct flight to Addis Ababa.
   Ayrikyan, who served 17 years in Soviet prisons and labor camps
before his release last year following a government review of
political sentencings, was in frequent contact with Western
journalists earlier this year when Armenians began a drive to annex
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   He was arrested March 25 and charged with defaming the Soviet
state in his reports to Moscow-based correspondents. Soviet
authorities have not allowed foreign journalists to travel to the
Caucasus Mountain region since the Nagorno-Karabakh issue surfaced.
   American and other Western officials in Moscow last week
declined to give the expelled nationalist refuge on the grounds
that he had not personally requested it.
   Mrs. Sidorenko said her daughter, Yelena Ayrikyan, was planning
to contact U.S. diplomats in Moscow about joining her husband in
the United States.
   In Moscow, U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said that as
of this morning the American Consulate had not received application
for asylum from Yelena Ayrikyan or other members of Arikyan's
family.
   ``But if they should approach us, clearly we're going to move
expeditiously to reunite them,'' Gilbert said.
   He said he could not immediately confirm whether Ayrikyan
approached U.S. diplomats in Addis Ababa.
   Armenians who form a majority of the 162,000 population in the
contested region in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan allege
mistreatment by the Azerbaijani government. They began a vocal
campaign in February to join the Soviet republic of Armenia, but
the Soviet leadership last week rejected the annexation bid.

<HEAD>Mayor Disbands Police Department In Overtime Suit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   FLEMING-NEON, Ky. (AP) _ The mayor has temporarily disbanded the
police department because of a lawsuit over overtime, even though
he's afraid the move would ``attract every little thief within 100
miles.''
   Mayor James Seals laid off the department's four officers and
one dispatcher at midnight Sunday. He said the layoffs might last
almost a year so the town could save enough money to pay off about
$50,000 in overtime.
   The mayor said Tuesday that some of Fleming-Neon's 1,500
residents have started neighborhood foot patrols, and State Police
and the Sheriff's Department were providing extra surveillance. He
said there had been no crime so far.
   Police Chief Carlos Phillips and four former officers sued on
June 27, seeking about $31,000 owed them for overtime.
   Seals said six other people who had worked for the department
could file similar lawsuits, and the city's total liability was
between $50,000 and $55,000.
   ``It has completely wiped us out,'' Seals said. ``At the present
time we just don't have the money.''
   The department's annual operating budget was about $61,000, so
the layoffs could continue for nearly one year, he said.
   ``I'm afraid this is going to attract every little thief within
100 miles around here when they realize we don't have a police
department,'' Seals said.
   A state audit early this year that showed the city owed 11
present and former officers for overtime worked during the past
five years.
   The city proposed a $39,500 settlement in February but Seals
said negotiations broke down. No trial date has been set.
   The mayor said the city received about $11,000 per year from the
state to help pay for police operations, and the remainder must
come from local taxes. Seals said the state should provide more
money for police departments.
   Fleming-Neon, composed of two former coal camps, is in
mountainous southeastern Kentucky near the Virginia border.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Sergeant Banged Recruit's Nose on Mirror</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force training sergeant poked a
recruit with a flag pole and banged his nose into a mirror until it
bled, and stuck a pen up another recruit's nose, according to
testimony at a court martial.
   Staff Sgt. David O'Neal, 27, is charged with mistreating
recruits at Lackland Air Force Base.
   Air Force regulations strictly prohibit verbal or physical abuse
of recruits, and the case is being watched closely by other base
instructors who fear it could affect how basic training is
conducted.
   One instructor at the hearing said most of his colleagues
support O'Neal.
   Another training instructor faces court-martial Aug. 18 on
similar charges, and a third instructor is under investigation.
   One recruit testified Tuesday that O'Neal took him to the
latrine, put his face in front of the toilet, flushed it and told
him to``look at his future.''
   Witnesses also accused O'Neal of butting two recruits with his
stiff-brimmed hat so hard that the bridges of their noses bled; of
making a recruit eat a piece of paper, and of pulling two other
recruits by their dog tag chains.
   The seven-year Air Force veteran faces six months' confinement
and a bad-conduct discharge if convicted by a panel of four
officers.
   Defense attorney Capt. Lawrence Middleton said O'Neal's
practices, especially putting a hat up to recruits' faces, is
common and that O'Neal was merely being a tough instructor trying
to command the respect of his recruits.
   O'Neal banged one recruit's nose against a bathroom mirror and
poked him in the chest with a wooden flag pole because he lacked
``military bearing,'' witnesses said Tuesday.
   Another of the 11 airmen testifying said O'Neal had stuck a pen
an inch up his nose.
   O'Neal complained in a pre-trial interview that training at
Lackland had become more like a Boy Scout camp because of the many
restrictions on instructors.

<HEAD>Postal Workers Accused of Throwing Away Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven postal workers arrested on charges they
tossed nearly 60,000 pieces of mail into the trash were trying to
shave a couple of hours off their work day, a prosecutor says.
   The carriers were arrested Tuesday and released on their own
recognizance. Destroying mail carries up to six months in prison
and a $500 fine.
   Postal Inspector J. Randolph Cox said about 75 percent of the
mail _ 44,800 pieces _ could have been delivered as addressed.
   Sixty of the 59,700 letters were first-class mail. About 5
percent was second-class _ magazines and newspapers _ and the
remainder bulk mail.
   The motive for the dumping was ``to save a couple of hours a day
of work,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas DeFeis said Tuesday.
   Officials said they will deliver the recovered mail after it is
photographed.
   The investigation began after postal inspectors received a tip
that a carrier had emptied a mailbag into a trash bin behind a
Brooklyn post office April 6.
   Postal officials put a video camera near the bin and between May
18 and June 21 caught carriers in the act, investigators said.
   One defendant, Gil A. Holmes, superintendent of mails at the
post office, stood nearby as the carriers tossed in mail,
investigators said.

<HEAD>New South African Ambassador Calls On Israel To Drop Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As anti-apartheid protesters rallied outside,
South Africa's new ambassador received his accreditation today and
called on the Israeli government to end its sanctions against his
country.
   ``The sanctions are counterproductive,'' Ambassador Johan
Viljoen said after the ceremony at the home of President Chaim
Herzog. ``They won't help the people they're supposed to help.''
   In 1986, Israel banned new defense contracts with South Africa,
as well as government loans and investments. The government also
said it would not promote tourism to South Africa or serve as a
transit point for countries trying to circumvent international
trade sanctions against Pretoria.
   Israel adopted the sanctions to comply with the U.S. Congress,
which threatened to cut foreign aid to countries which did not
punish Pretoria for its apartheid policy.
   ``We will do our best to persuade the Israeli government such
measures would only be harmful to the poorer sections of our
population,'' Viljoen told Israel radio.
   Dozens of demonstrators protested outside Herzog's home, calling
on Israel to distance itself from apartheid, the
government-legislated system of desegregation that bars South
Africa's 25.6 million blacks from a role in public life.
   Viljoen said he was not fazed by the protest. ``I've received so
many messages of welcome, and such a warm welcome, that completely
outweighs the small demonstrations that have taken place.''
   Viljoen arrived in Israel 10 days ago, on the same day the
jailed leader of South Africa's blacks, Nelson Mandela, celebrated
his 70th birthday.

   A lawyer who steers work to a lover may be
flirting with a lawsuit.
   A state appeals court Tuesday ruled that a husband could sue his
wife's lawyer for assigning a crucial report in their divorce case
to a psychologist with whom the lawyer allegedly was romantically
involved.
   The husband, Barry Silberg, said the report prepared by
psychologist Robert Adler during Silberg's 1984 divorce from his
wife, Janet, was biased and led to his being denied reasonable
visitation rights to his children.
   Silberg blamed attorney Margaret Anderson, who he said had
promised a neutral report but didn't tell him about her
relationship with Adler.
   The appeals court said Anderson's conduct was not protected by
legal privilege if Silberg can show that she intentionally deceived
him for her own benefit or her client's.

<HEAD>Expansion Healthy, But Inflation Up Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy 3.1
percent annual rate from April through June, but inflation shot up
at the fastest pace in almost six years, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said growth in the gross national
product, the broadest measure of economic health, was down only
slightly from a 3.4 percent increase in the first three months of
the year.
   Inflation, however, picked up substantially during the spring,
with a price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of
4.7 percent, the biggest advance since a 5.5 percent rise in the
third quarter of 1982.
   This inflation index, which measures a fixed selection of goods,
had risen 3.5 percent in the first quarter.
   Today's report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs
for a wide range of consumer goods.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The report shows
the economy continuing to grow at a moderately healthy pace in the
first half of the year, with some slowing more recently. Investment
is strong; the real trade deficit is narrowing, and slower growth
of domestic demand bodes well for future improvements.''
   As to concerns about inflation, Fitzwater said, ``Inflation
remains low and under control; there are moderating influences in
the last several months that indicate steady growth, but without a
return to inflation.''
   While the U.S. economy is performing substantially better than
had been expected at the start of the year, the more robust growth
has triggered inflation fears.
   Recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that if
economic activity did not slow in coming months, the central bank
was prepared to dampen demand by pushing interest rates up further.
Economists worry, however, that if credit is tightened too severely
it could trigger a recession next year.
   But Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said
he was not overly concerned by the rise in inflation. He said most
of the price pressure came in increases for clothing and energy
early in the spring. He said those gains have since been reversed.
   ``I don't think this is a sign that we will have higher
inflation ahead,'' he said.
   Today's GNP report was accompanied by benchmark revisions in GNP
data over the last three years, part of an annual review to update
the data to reflect new information.
   The revisions substantially boosted growth last year to an
annual rate of 3.4 percent, largely because of higher consumer
spending. The earlier estimate had put GNP growth last year at 2.9
percent.
   The Reagan administration recently revised its estimate of
growth for all of 1988 to 3 percent, when measured from the fourth
quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this.
   Because the economy grew at a 3.25 percent annual rate in the
first half of this year, growth could dip as low as 2.7 percent in
the second half of the year and still meet the administration's
target, which is in line with the expectations of many private
analysts.
   Many economists are expecting growth to slow in the second half
of the year, in part because of the adverse effects of the severe
drought in the farm belt.
   The drought's impact was already being felt in the spring
quarter, reducing total GNP growth by $5.5 billion, today's report
said.
   Overall, GNP grew at an annual rate of $30.2 billion in the
spring quarter, pushing total inflation-adjusted GNP to $3.986
trillion in the second quarter.
   Much of the strength came from a $18.9 billion improvement in
the country's trade deficit, the biggest narrowing of the deficit
since a $24.8 billion shrinkage in the first quarter of 1980.
   Also contributing to growth in the April-June quarter was a
$14.4 billion rise in consumer spending, which climbed at an annual
rate of 2.3 percent.
   Business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during
the spring as U.S. manufacturers continued to spend heavily to
expand production facilities because of export demands.
   Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second
quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent.
   Even housing construction showed some strength in the second
quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent
drop in the first quarter.
   John Wilson, chief economist of Bank of America, said he
believed GNP growth would slow to a rate of 2.5 percent to 3
percent from July through December.
   ``The rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow
growth in the second half and I am looking for unemployment to rise
a little bit as well,'' he said.
   Christopher Caton, director of forecasting for Data Resources
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm, said he was
looking for the economy to slow, either on its own or because of
inflation-fighting moves on the part of the Federal Reserve.
   ``If the Fed doesn't see some signs that the economy is slowing,
then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear
that inflation could get out of hand,'' Caton said.
   John Hagens, an economist at the WEFA Group, another private
forecasting service, said he believed growth would be reduced by
about one-half percentage point in the second half of the year
because of the adverse impact of the drought. He said the higher
prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount
of income they have to spend on other items.

   Vandals may have tormented an African
antelope found dead in its pen at the Pueblo Zoo with a broken
back, zookeepers said.
   The body of the male beisa oryx was discovered Monday by workers
reporting for duty.
   ``There's a strong possibility that the animal was teased and
irritated, and (it) ran into the fence and broke its back,'' Marti
Osborn of the Pueblo Zoological Society said Tuesday. ``There were
some people in the zoo during the night.''
   Senior zookeeper Rich Wilson said vandals apparently climbed
over the zoo fence Sunday night and ``threw benches into the moat,
broke a window and strung some pipe into the moat.''
   Wilson said a new mate for the zoo's female beisa oryx will cost
about $500.
   The Zoological Society appealed Tuesday to the City Council for
more money for the zoo. Osborn said the zoo needs better fences,
among other items.
   ``We're concerned about the animals' safety. It could help if
they put up some barbed wire'' atop the fence, she said.

<TEXT>
   An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a Navy
destroyer with the help of sailors was hospitalized today after she
apparently went into convulsions while being taken to a return
flight to Ireland, officials said.
   Five sailors accused of helping the girl cross the Atlantic
aboard the USS Conyngham remained in custody, the Navy said.
   The girl, who Navy officials said is 16 years old and who Irish
officials said is 15, was found Saturday evening aboard the guided
missile destroyer when it arrived after a 10-day cruise from Cobh,
Ireland.
   She was being flown Tuesday from Washington to Atlanta for a
flight to Ireland when she became ill, and the plane made an
emergency stop at an airport near Raleigh, N.C., Charles Coble, a
Naval Investigative Service spokesman, said today.
   Coble said the girl complained of nausea and went into
convulsions but was expected to be released from a hospital in the
Raleigh-Durham area today. Archie Galloway, an Atlantic Fleet
spokesman, said she would continue her journey to Atlanta today.
   The girl had been treated at a hospital for dehydration and
seasickness after she was found aboard the Conyngham.
   She reportedly told officials she was orphaned at the age of 13
and wanted to come to the United States to get a job, but officials
said they have located her mother in Ireland.
   Police in Dublin identified the girl as Suzanne Twomey, 15, from
the port city of Cork. She is the eldest of four children. Her
parents, John and Christine Twomey, who had reported her missing,
declined comment Wednesday.
   A police spokesman who spoke on condition on anonymity said Miss
Twomey has run away several times previously and once had to be
brought home from Spain.
   The destroyer had made a courtesy visit to Cork harbor and was
opened to the public, police said.
   The girl spent 10 days inside a small passage aboard the ship.
The passage, 2{ feet wide and 15 feet long, houses electrical
cables and passes over the ship's refrigeration units near the
galley.
   Some sailors apparently brought the girl food and water during
the trip, the Navy said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Max Allen, a Navy spokesman in Atlanta, said today he
didn't know what caused the girl's illness Tuesday night. ``When
the medical evaluation is complete, she will continue her return to
Ireland and will be escorted by an NIS agent,'' he said.
   Galloway said she was given a complete physical by Navy doctors
before the flight to Atlanta and no health problems were found.
   Naval Investigative Service agents had escorted the girl to
Washington, D.C., where she met Irish embassy officials. From
there, NIS agents planned to take her to Atlanta for a flight to
Dublin.
   Five sailors from the ship have been jailed for allegedly
helping the stowaway. No charges have been filed yet, said Lt.
Cmdr. John Lloyd, spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet Surface Force.
   The maximum penalty for aiding an illegal entry into the United
States is five years in prison and a $2,000 fine, officials said.

   President Reagan said today that Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ``is not good for Panama'' or
for U.S. relations with the Central American country, but declined
to comment on a report that he had authorized covert activity to
force Noriega from power.
   However, House Speaker Jim Wright said, ``I am told it was the
subject of CIA briefings.'' He declined to elaborate.
   ``I am not going to coment on anything in the nature of covert
operations,'' Reagan told reporters who questioned him as he opened
a meeting with Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz that
was unrelated to Panama.
   Asked whether there was any way he saw that Noriega could be
removed from power, Reagan said, ``I shouldn't be commenting on
that. Certainly, he is not good for Panama, good for our
relations.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to confirm or
deny the published report that Reagan this month authorized covert
activity aimed at forcing Noriega's removal from power.
   Fitzwater did say that Reagan recently reassured deposed
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle of U.S. efforts to
restore democracy in his country.
   Fitzwater said the administration would have been required by
law to notify congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours
of a new covert action finding or decision. But he refused to say
whether those panels had, in fact, been told of an undercover plan
against Noriega, as reported in a story published in today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   The story said that while Reagan had given the go-ahead for the
covert activity, no U.S. military action was imminent and
paramilitary action, such as a kidnaping, was unlikely.
   The Post reported that, according to administration and
congressional sources, Reagan informed Congress and Delvalle of his
action.
   The Post quoted a well-placed source who said no military action
was imminent but declined to discuss any details of the covert
plan. Another source said it appears the authorization involves
activities that fall short of a paramilitary operation to remove
Noriega, such as kidnaping him.
   According to the newspaper, Senate and House intelligence
committees have been briefed on the action.
   Fitzwater did confirm during today's White House news briefing
that Reagan telephoned Delvalle on July 15 in New York, where the
Panamanian was receiving a medical examination. But he would not
confirm that Reagan had informed Delvalle of a new covert action
effort, as the Post reported.
   ``The president called him in New York simply to reiterate his
support for President Delvalle and his continued commitment to
freedom in Panama,'' Fitzwater said.
   When asked if Reagan also had discussed covert operations with
Delvalle, the spokesman replied, ``We never discuss covert
activities. ... I would just say the discussion was limited to the
points I mentioned. ... There's been no changes in policy and no
new actions taken.''
   Pressed further on this point, Fitzwater said, ``I can't
fine-tune it any more for you without violating my rule about not
commenting on intelligence matters.''
   The administration since June 1987 has been making efforts _
including a series of economic sanctions against Panama _ to oust
Noriega, whom it previously had considered a Central American ally.
   Fitzwater maintained today that the sanctions ``are having an
impact, and we anticipate no change.''
   Among the actions the United States has taken against Panama are
the freezing of its assets and the invocation of the emergency
legislation authorizing the U.S. government to bar the payment of
taxes to Panama by businesses with operations there.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. The administration this spring sought to
negotiate a deal under which Noriega would agree to leave Panama in
return for dropping the indictment, but the deal fell through.

   California's contestant in the
Miss Teen USA pageant was disqualified after four competitors
accused her of sneaking out of her room to visit her boyfriend
after curfew, a local organizer says.
   Richard Guy, director of the Miss Teen California pageant, said
Tuesday Miss Teen USA officials told him that four contestants had
written a letter accusing Alison Moreno of violating the 11 p.m.
curfew.
   Miss Moreno, Miss Teen California, was allowed to participate in
the televised pageant Monday night but was disqualified for
rule-breaking, said pageant spokeswoman Martha Keyser, who declined
to specify the infraction.
   However, pageant publicist Les Schecter said after the Monday
night telecast that Miss Moreno had violated curfew.
   The 51 girls in the contest were chaperoned and required to
abide by a number of rules during their three-week stay prior to
the pageant.
   Guy questioned whether the word of four of Miss Moreno's
competitors was sufficient to disqualify her.
   ``They're just girls competing for a title. What do they know?''
he said.
   Miss Teen USA officials refused to comment whether other
contestants had reported Miss Moreno for breaking curfew, Ms.
Keyser said Tuesday.
   ``This is between the pageant and the contestant. This isn't for
the public domain,'' she said. ``She didn't break any law.''
   Miss Moreno's family also declined comment.
   Meanwhile, the new Miss Teen USA, Mindy Duncan of Oregon, said
Tuesday she didn't think Miss Moreno's disqualification detracted
from her victory.
   ``I'm really proud of where I am,'' said Miss Duncan, a
16-year-old who wants to either to be a dentist or to counsel
children about drugs. ``It was a wonderful experience, it was such
a confidence-booster.''
   It was the second time in six weeks that controversy has
interfered with a beauty contest in California.
   As the winners of the Miss California contest were being
announced in a televised pageant in San Diego on June 13, Michelle
Anderson, 21, of Santa Cruz, unfurled from her bosom a white silk
banner that read ``Pageants hurt all women.'' She was hustled off
the stage.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the Democratic convention:
   Ann Richards' keynote address to the Democratic convention was
pungent ... but there seemed to be a curious vacuum at the heart of
the speech. ...
   The Democrats are having trouble defining exactly what it is
they believe.
   It's easy to see the Democrats' problem. Many parts of the
country are still enjoying something close to full employment. ...
   Helping the disadvantaged has gone out of style, and there's no
money available anyway. Serious ecomonic problems ... are
abstractions to many voters.
   And Democrats, burned in 1984 by Walter Mondale's honest but
unpopular talk of raising taxes, aren't likely to get more specific
about remedies.
   In his dealings with Jesse Jackson, (Michael) Dukakis showed a
streak of arrogance. (George) Bush, described as warm and sociable
by his friends, could look good by contrast.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the downing of Iran Air Flight 655:
   Had Iran Air Flight 655's routine communications with airport
traffic controllers been monitored by the U.S. warship that shot it
down, the tragedy might not have occurred.
   While one must obviously be wary of accepting Iranian claims,
the alleged transcript of talk between the airliner pilot and
controllers ... is persuasive evidence that this was a regularly
scheduled civilian flight.
   Additional evidence compiled ... tends to justify the cruiser
captain's last-minute decision. ...
   It was a decision made in a combat situation, with various data
suggesting that the plane might be an Iranian fighter on a
descending course directly toward the Vincennes.
   Why didn't Flight 655 respond to repeated warnings from the
Vicennes? The answer to that one may never be known. ...
   But this troubling thought remains: If only the Vincennes had
carefully monitored civilian flights in the area it patrolled ...
(the plane) very likely would not have been shot down.

   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on energy conservation:
   Among the many government reports issued (last) week was one
that should alarm most Americans.
   That report, done by the Energy Department's semiautonomous
Energy Information Administration, shows the United States may have
topped out on energy efficiency and now may be sliding into its
wasteful ways again. ...
   Behind this growing binge is the relative low cost and abundance
of fuel. ...
   But energy costs can quickly turn around, as the oil embargoes
of 1973 and 1979 showed. ...
   Let's hope Americans can retes and the District of Columbia,
are the largest and most accessible form of gambling.
   It is as simple as a trip to the grocery store and many
Americans who would never venture to an off-track betting parlor
will readily pick up lottery tickets.
   But easy access also means easy addiction. Professionals who
counsel gamblers are warning that chronic and compulsive gambling
increases the longer gambling is allowed.
   New Jersey was one of the first states to get on the lottery
bandwagon 20 years ago. Under pressure from officials who must deal
with the social consequences of gambling, lottery operators have
labeled their 4,500 machines with the phone number of State Council
on Compulsive Gambling.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on military base closings:
   By passing a bill that passes the buck for closing military
bases, the House of Representatives earlier this month followed the
Senate in admitting its incompetence in yet another field.
   This comes three years after Congress ducked its responsibility
on deficits by passing the Gramm-Rudman plan for automatic spending
cuts and six years after lawmakers handed off Social Security's
ills to a bipartisan commission.
   Even though this was one more embarrassment, empowering an
independent panel to handle base closing, it was the right move.

   Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union on
subsidizing Olympic athletes:
   To compete for an Olympic medal, you must train full-time for
years.
   How do you do that? With money.
   Last week, the U.S. Olympic Committee finally came to the
obvious conclusion: If America wants to win gold medals, its
athletes will have to be paid. ...
   To help the young unknown athletes, the USOC hopes to raise $25
million this year from the sale of Olympic coins. ...
   It would be hard to make a case for supporting them with tax
dollars. ...
   But if private citizens want to subsidize America's future
Olympic athletes, they should be able to do so.
   To many Americans, that would seem a small price for victory.

   Worthington (Minn.) Daily Globe on handgun control:
   Another important vote will be coming to the floor of the U.S.
House of Representatives within the next few days.
   The bill is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which was approved
by the House Judiciary Committee June 30 along with an amendment
that would require a waiting period before anyone can purchase a
handgun.
   The amendment has been officially named the Brady Amendment, for
White House Press Secretary James Brady. ...
   Brady was shot in the head with a handgun that was purchased
over the counter in Texas, one of the many states where nearly
anyone with cash can buy a handgun over the counter. ...
   The Brady Amendment is a logical first step toward limiting the
number of handguns available to convicted felons in the United
States. ...
   We urge Congress to support the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 with
the Brady Amendment attached.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on a Soviet-US anti-drug agreement:
   The United States and (the) Soviet Union are negotiating an
agreement to cooperate in the battle against illegal drugs.
   According to David L. Westrate, head of operations for the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration, the agreement for a joint
anti-drug effort by the two superpowers is expected to be signed
this year.
   The United States and (the) Soviet Union should lead the way in

   Los Angeles Daily News on Dukakis-Bush differences:
   It seems likely that (Democratic presidential nominee Michael)
Dukakis may favor the broad use of business-government-labor
``partnerships'' while (Vice President George) Bush may tie himself
tighter to the market-oriented policy of the Reagan years.
   The partnership approach _ which has involved housing, downtown
rehabilitation, mall development and factory retooling _ has been
the Democrats' answer to free enterprise for decades now. ...
   But partnership's track record has been a rather inauspicious
one. Often, it has been a story of taxpayer money used less to
leverage valuable projects and more to line the pockets of
influential developers, political cronies and _ through kickbacks _
corrupt politicians. ...
   It wouldn't surprise us if Bush and Dukakis found themselves in
a lively exchange over partnership, which could prove to be one of
the more philosophical _ and interesting _ debates of their
campaign.

   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News on ending the Cambodian civil war:
   An Indonesian cocktail party may bring an end to almost two
decades of killing in Cambodia.
   After months of hesitation, the four major factions in the
Cambodian civil war have gathered near Jakarta, using the pretext
of a cocktail party, to begin peace talks. ...
   The four factions are talking ... if only because the three
Cambodian groups are exhausted, and the Vietnamese, who have lost
55,000 troops in the war, realize they can't control their
neighbors.
   The Cambodian civil war has been a war without a winner. All the
participants, including Vietnam and years back the United States,
have been losers.
   Maybe it's all those losses without hope of victory that will
move the combatants to seek peace over cocktails or at the

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the McKay-Meese report:
   Independent prosecutor James McKay's report bears further
witness to the proposition, long since accepted by much of the
public, that Edwin Meese was the wrong man for the job of top law
enforcement officer of the United States.
   What McKay said, in effect, is this: Meese is a crook but I
won't prosecute him.
   McKay and his dozens of investigators spent 14 months and $1.7
million looking into Meese's activities. His final report to the
court that appointed him included these highlights:
   _ Meese probably committed three felonies, one having to do with
omission of capital gains income from his tax form and two
involving ... participation in decisions that could have enhanced
the value of stock Meese held in telephone companies.
   _ Meese probably was guilty of a misdemeanor in failing to pay
on time the taxes due on the omitted capital gain.
   Meese claims the report ``vindicates'' him because of the
decision against prosecution. It does no such thing.

   These are the same wonderful folks who produced a string of
crude peasants and incontinent old men as leaders of the empire.
   So what if Dukakis will never slam dunk anything more than a
soda can in a trash bin. Nikita Khrushchev was no taller than a
samovar, and he was twice as round as he was tall. ...
   As far as presidential decorum, try to imagine Dukakis taking a
shoe off in a public place; say, the United Nations.
   The Duke's bushy eyebrows are manicured putting greens compared
to the shaggy tundra that Leonid Breshnev used to pack around.
   Pravda did credit Dukakis with brains and management skills and
noted he sounded better than the raspy voice of George Bush, his

   But C-Span redeemed it all by keeping its cameras trained on the

unpredictable flashes of wit, moments of comedy or interesting
statements that go along with putting large numbers of people on

   Jackson definitely touches a live wire running through the

reverend himself.
   The Jackson-Dukakis spat began with the choice of Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as the vice-presidential nominee _ a choice made
earlier than usual.
   In keeping with that trend, ... Dukakis could begin to reach the

   Congress inched forward on the politically
potent child care issue Wednesday when a Senate committee approved
a $2.5 billion initiative designed to expand and improve day care.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee approved the Act
for Better Child Care Services, or ABC bill, on a voice vote with
no audible opposition.
   But the vote followed a pledge by committee Democrats, the major
force behind the bill, to try to work out a bipartisan version of
ABC before it reaches the Senate floor.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of a less expensive rival
child care bill, called for the bipartisan cooperation after
declaring that ``we're just playing politics.'' He urged committee
members to approve the ABC bill ``and then we'll sit down and work
this thing out and do what's right for families and children.''
   ABC proponents agreed to talks but made no promises.
   ``He's laid open a very interesting challenge,'' said committee
chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``Whether we're going to be able
to meet it or not is a real question.''
   ``He has my commitment for a solid, good-faith effort,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chief sponsor of the ABC bill.
``I'm hopeful we can do something. Maybe we won't be able to.''
   Three-quarters of the money under the ABC bill would help
families making less than 100 percent of a state's median income
pay for child care. The remainder would go to states for capital
improvements to day care centers and homes, staff training, staff
salaries and administrative costs.
   A national advisory committee would develop minimum safety and
staffing standards which states would have to adopt, and only homes
and centers conforming to the standards would be eligible for the
federal money.
   Some Democrats would prefer that the ABC bill be passed intact,
reasoning that a presidential veto could only help their candidates
on the campaign trail this fall. Hatch and other Republicans are
seeking a more modest bipartisan bill that GOP candidates can tout
in an election season colored by family concerns.
   Hatch complained that the ABC bill would cost an enormous amount
but wouldn't do much to ease the national day care shortage. He
said ABC would subsidize only 700,000 day care slots, while
California alone needs 1 million.
   Hatch's own bill, one of a dozen proposals pending on Capitol
Hill, would provide $250 million to states to expand or improve
care, including aid to poor families; $100 million for liability
pools; and $25 million for capital improvements. States would have
to develop and adopt their own standards. Businesses would receive
tax breaks for starting day care centers.
   If the ABC bill reaches the Senate floor in its present form,
Hatch said he would offer three to four weeks' worth of amendments
``because there are that many criticisms that can be lodged''
against it.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., said the most efficient way to get
child care money to people who need it would be through tax
credits, as in several pending bills and the plan proposed this
week by Vice President George Bush.
   But Kennedy, Dodd and others said a tax credit wouldn't help
improve day care quality nor would it be of sufficient help to the
neediest. They said day care costs an average of $3,000 a year per
child _ far more than the credits being proposed _ and the credits
would only arrive once a year, during tax refund season, after
families had already laid out money for child care.
   The House Education and Labor Committee canceled a work session
Wednesday on its similar version of the ABC bill. The House measure
is mired in controversy over whether federal money should be
available to the substantial number of day care programs affiliated
with churches or synagogues.
   The committee tentatively rescheduled the work session for next
Wednesday.
   Both the Senate and House ABC bills have been rephrased to make
sure that such programs are eligible for federal money, as long as
it is not used for religious instruction.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups contend the
provision violates the constitutional wall between church and state.

   The drought and heat laying waste to
West Virginia's legal farm products may be a boon to marijuana
growers, yielding more potent pot, the state's agriculture
commissioner says.
   Gus R. Douglass said Monday that the marijuana plants are
stunted, but the enzymes that produce a ``high'' are more
concentrated.
   ``When you get hot, dry weather like this, it does improve the
quality of the marijuana,'' he said. ``It could be a more potent
crop out there.''
   The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
estimates marijuana was the state's leading cash crop in 1987 with
a value of $811.2 million. West Virginia's major legal crop was
hay, worth $57.7 million last year.
   State Agriculture Department statistician John Brueggen said
NORML's estimates may be conservative.
   ``There could be 10 times that amount out there. It wouldn't
suprise me,'' he said.
   Douglass estimated farm losses on legal goods will total $66
million this year.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 20 garbagemen Wednesday
as 1,200 of their colleagues continued a five-day strike to protest
the end of a popular television series, a news agency reported.
   Municipal officials in the Punjab city of Jalandhar told the
United News of India that the workers' refusal to collect garbage
could spread disease. At least 50 people have died of
gastro-enteritis and cholera in Punjab state this month.
   The series ``Ramayana'' is based on the story of Lord Rama, a
legendary warrior-king in Hindu folklore.
   An estimated 100 million people have watched the program each
week since it started in January 1987. It has been called the most
popular Indian TV series ever, and irate viewers have been known to
stone electricity offices after unscheduled power cuts interrupted
its screening.
   The series' 78-week run is scheduled to end later this month,
but the Jalandhar garbagemen have called for an extension to show
incidents in the lives of Rama's two sons.
   According to the Illustrated Weekly of India magazine, the
producer of the series applied for an extension but was refused
permission by India's government-owned national TV channel.
   The 20 garbagemen who were arrested Wednesday were accused of
trying to break a police cordon during a protest march in
Jalandhar, about 200 miles northwest of New Delhi, UNI said. The
men were arrested outside a Hindu temple.

   A drought ravaging large tracts of
central and eastern China is killing farm animals and shriveling
crops, and officials fear that mountain villagers could be starving
by autumn.
   ``My fields are bare. My cotton and lotus roots are dead. This
year we won't even have a fen (penny). It's time to live on wheat
and sweet potatoes,'' said Chen Xuelian, a 39-year-old farmer and
father of two from Xiangfan, a town in northeastern Hubei province.
   A trip this week through four counties in Hubei and the province
of Henan revealed bone-dry reservoirs, parched rice paddies,
stunted cotton and sesame fields, and corn that had died on the
stalk.
   Wells for drinking water contained nothing but mud. Many rivers
had run dry.
   In a Hubei village, all the vegetable fields had been abandoned,
baked by the sun into an earthen jigsaw puzzle. Peasants said they
would eat only grain this year.
   In another, a water buffalo went through its death throes.
Villagers said the beast died from thirst.
   A mile away from Chen's fields, Wang Hua was selling her paltry
harvest of watermelons on a country road. The melons were the size
of baseballs and tasteless.
   ``Some of my relatives have already gone to the city for work,''
she said. ``If there's no work, they'll just ave to beg.''
   Officials in Xiangfan and Wuhan, provincial capital of Hubei,
said the drought was the worst in 50 years. In the town of Fang
Xian, historians reported that not since 1578, in the Ming dynasty,
had their town seen such a blight.
   Peasants have dubbed the drought-stricken area ``han baozi,'' or
the ``dried bun'' _ the Chinese equivalent to the Dust Bowl in the
United States.
   Official Chinese reports say the drought began in May and has
hit eight out of China's 30 provinces.
   In some areas, such as Hubei, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu
provinces, however, the disaster began in February, soon after the
Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival.
   ``Since the Spring Festival, we haven't had one good rain,''
said Tao Weile, secretary of the Communist Party in the Hubei
village of Shiqiaozhen. ``Since May 28, all together it's rained
for 10 minutes.''
   Officials in Wuhan said 3 million out of the province's 55
million people were having problems getting drinking water.
Newspapers say millions in Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu provinces are
without potable water.
   Hubei officials reported damage to rice, vegetable and cash
crops. In all, about half of the province's 9 million acres of
agricultural land has been hurt by the drought, they said.
   About 70 percent of the peanut and sesame seed crop has been
destroyed, they said. And out of the 2.3 million acres of rice
planted, the drought has affected half, they said. At least 25
percent of the crop was expected to be demolished.
   Other provinces have reported difficulties on a similar scale,
according to the official press.
   ``The problem here is that the drought has lasted for such a
long time. The peasants in some areas have planted their fields
three times, but once they get a bud it dies,'' said Zeng Fanrong,
spokesman for Hubei's Water Conservancy Bureau.
   Both Zeng and Fu Qiuzhen, a spokeswoman for Hubei's Agriculture
and Husbandry Bureau, said they were worried that starvation would
hit areas of northern Hubei province. Other officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, expressed similar fears about Henan and
Anhui provinces.
   ``Right now, the key goal of the province is to ensure that
everybody has enough to eat,'' Ms. Fu said. ``We are struggling to
provide the basic necessities.''
   To fight the drought, officials in Wuhan and Xiangfan said work
teams had been sent to affected areas to dig wells and carry water
in buckets to the parched fields. And trucks carrying drinking
water have been sent to hard-hit areas.
   Pumps and electrical generators have been sent to the
countryside to help transport water from the few reservoirs that
aren't dried up.
   Officials in Xiangfan said peasants who are unable to produce
sufficient grain to meet contracts set with the state will be
relieved of the burden so they can concentrate on growing enough
food to eat.
   Under the agricultural reforms that have occurred in the last
decade, peasants contract with the state each year to produce a
certain amount of grain. Anything they produce above the quota,
they can keep or sell on the free market. Vegetables and cash
crops, such as tobacco, can all be sold on the market.
   Xiangfan officials also reported that factories and other work
units had sent old clothes and cans of food to the drought-stricken
areas.

<HEAD>Drought Bill Would Provide $150 Million to Tobacco Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers would provide an estimated $150
million in disaster payments to tobacco growers under pending
drought-relief legislation, a policy departure already drawing fire
from anti-smoking forces.
   ``This is a step out of line with the ordinary no-net-cost''
program of price supports for tobacco, ``but it's because of the
special situation of the drought,'' said Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C.,
chairman of the House tobacco and peanuts subcommittee.
   ``I certainly think it's a bad idea,'' said John F. Banzhaf III,
director of Action on Smoking and Health, one of the nation's major
anti-smoking organizations.
   ``To be providing $150 million because a crop that kills people
is damaged, and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating
people about the hazards about tobacco is really an example of
having priorities upside down,'' Banzhaf said.
   Rose said the provision was in no way an effort to bypass ``the
normal economic operation'' of the tobacco program, in which no tax
money, outside of administrative costs, is supposed to be used for
price supports.
   Under 1983 farm legislation, tobacco lawmakers agreed to a
provision requiring growers to finance their price-support system
themselves, in contrast to other farmers who receive government
subsidies. The law, which remains in effect, forbids the use of
taxpayers' money for tobacco price supports except for $15 million
in administrative costs.
   This ``no-net-cost'' compromise with anti-smoking forces has
been the focus of a series of controversies since then.
   Anti-smoking forces contend that a complex 1986 law enabled the
Agriculture Department to arrange a $1 billion, taxpayer-financed
bailout of the tobacco price-support system without violating the
letter of the law.
   Rose, an outspoken House champion of tobacco growers, was able
to incorporate language into the drought relief bill that seeks to
make clear that the envisioned disaster payments for growers are
not a violation of the no-net-cost agreement because they are not
actually price supports.
   In the last major drought that hit American farmers, in 1983,
there were no disaster payments for tobacco growers, even though
the crop of burley tobacco produced primarily in Kentucky and
Tennessee was badly damaged by sun and a shortage of rainfall.
   But the disaster that befell the 1983 crop was followed by the
1986 bailout legislation that anti-smoking forces say violated the
spirit if not the letter of the no-net-cost agreement.
   An effort last year by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to allow
tobacco exporters to benefit from a $1.5 billion export enhancement
subsidy program, by attaching a special provision to the omnibus
trade bill, was defeated after anti-smoking forces complained. They
also oppose the current provision.
   There is no way to know precisely how much of the $6 billion
drought bill would be devoted to tobacco payments because the
extent of damage to the crop is not yet known. But House
Agriculture Committee staff economist Howard Conley told lawmakers
in a note: ``Of $1.6 billion in payments for non-program crops,
some $150 million can be imputed to tobacco.''
   The drought bill has been moving through Congress at high speed.
   The House version of the measure cleared its committee hurdle on
Wednesday and is floor passage is expected by the end of the week.
The Senate is also planning to act on the legislation before the
weekend.
   Farm lawmakers from both houses said they are aiming to meet in
a conference committee next week to fashion the finished product
and send it to President Reagan's desk before they go on their
summer recess Aug. 11.
   A number of lawmakers who usually are critics of farm programs
said that they were not familiar enough with the legislation to
make a judgment on its provisions. They indicated they had not
heard of the tobacco provision.
   Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., the ranking Republican on the
Agriculture Committee, said that ``when you are doing something
like this you cannot discriminate against any crop.''
   Asked if he considered it a violation of an agreement, he said:
``No.''
   But he also noted that under a 1985 law farmers must have
purchased federal crop insurance to be eligible for disaster
payments but that provision has been waived under the drought bill.
   ``So that's a violation,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
violations of agreements and previous understandings that are
brought about by the circumstances. It's an agreement until the
circumstances change.''
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
said he did not want to address the tobacco subsidies issue in the
midst of the drought, but vowed to speak out on the question in
1990 when the next farm program is drawn up by Congress.
   Asked if he considered the topic of tobacco subsidies a
particularly touchy one on the Senate Agriculture Committee, Leahy
said: ``I certainly don't think it should be off limits any more
than any other subject should be off limits.''

   A woman who tried to kill a cocktail
waitress in 1980 to divert suspicion from the Hillside Strangler
escaped from prison by cutting through four fences with pruning
shears, an investigator said today.
   Veronica Lynn Compton, 31, broke out of the Washington
Corrections Center for Women about sundown Tuesday along with a
woman serving time for drug offenses, Candice L. Burk, 28, said
Pierce County Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Miner.
   Their trail led through dense brush to a highway, where a
tracking dog lost the scent, Miner said. There were no immediate
clues to whether the pair had outside help, he added.
   Ms. Compton was convicted in 1981 of trying to strangle Kim
Breed, 26, in a Bellingham motel so authorities would think the
Hillside Strangler who killed 10 women in Los Angeles and two in
Bellingham was still at large.
   Ms. Compton had said she was in love with Kenneth Bianchi, who
pleaded guilty to the slayings of two college students in
Bellingham and to five of the Los Angeles killings. Authorities
said she became enamored of him after his arrest.
   Bianchi is serving seven consecutive life sentences at the
Washington State Penitentiary near Walla Walla.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Compton planned to kill Ms. Breed in a
fashion similar to the Hillside Strangler slayings but that Ms.
Breed escaped.
   Ms. Compton was serving a life sentence for attempted murder;
Ms. Burk was serving time for drug manufacture and possession,
officials said.
   Veltry Johnson, a state Corrections Department spokesman, said
both were in medium security before being reported missing at a
head count. Ms. Burk was due for release next Tuesday, but the
state of Oregon was seeking her in a previous escape on which
Johnson had no details.
   Miner said the pair cut through four cyclone fences, each 10
feet to 12 feet high and topped with barbed wire.
   Investigators believe pruning shears were used in the escape.
Tools assigned to Ms. Burk's and Ms. Compton's unit were missing,
Miner said.
   ``Where they cut them, there's no way anybody would see them ...
unless they were making a special patrol,'' he said. ``There's no
surveillance in that area.''

   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq today
met with the secretary-general, but said his country will not
declare a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war until direct talks are
held with Iranian officials.
   ``Iraq shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step under the
present circumstances,'' Aziz said as he entered U.N. headquarters
for a meeting with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``We believe the first step and starter of constructive talks is
face-to-face negotiations between the two parties under the
auspices of the secretary-general,'' he said.
   ``If Iran does not accept that formula, it means they are not
sincere about peace,'' Aziz said. He said Iraq ``wants to be sure
that we are making real, durable and comprehensive peace'' to end
the 8-year-old war.
   As he spoke, heavy fighting between Iran and Iraq was reported.
   Iran said its forces drove Iraqi troops out of southern Iran and
fought Iraq for control of a town in western Iran. Tehran claimed
1,200 Iraqis were killed or wounded.
   Iraq claimed its forces shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane over
the southern front. Iran said its military shot down two Iraqi
warplanes.
   The tough stand by Aziz, who requested the current round of
cease-fire talks, could signal difficult going in the negotiations.
   Iran has opposed direct talks, but has left the door open to
possible direct contacts if requested by the secretary-general. The
U.N. chief said the talks initially would be separate and he would
mediate between the two sides.
   But he said he preferred direct talks and may request them later.
   Perez de Cuellar said today he hoped to be able to announce the
date for a cease-fire next week, along with other dates for
implementation of a U.N. peace plan to end the war.
   He also said he would raise the issue of foreign hostages held
by a pro-Iranian faction in Lebanon. ``I think they may assert
their possible influence in order to have this problem out of the
way for both humanitarian and political reason,'' Perez de Cuellar
said. Nine Americans are among the hostages.
   Aziz held a first round of talks this morning for one hour at
the secretary-general's residence near the United Nations. The
secretary-general's spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said the
unannounced meeting was held at Perez de Cuellar's residence for
``convenience.''
   Aziz and Perez de Cuellar then held a second meeting at U.N.
headquarters.
   On Tuesday, Iran's foreign minister accused Iraq of trying to
sabotage peace efforts with attacks he said involved the use of
chemical weapons.
   ``We said (to Perez de Cuellar) that if (the Iraqis) continue
their attack, we will give them a lesson that they won't forget,''
the Iranian minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said after twice meeting
with the U.N. chief.
   Velayati also was to meet today with Perez de Cuellar.
   Velayati said he discussed with Perez de Cueller a timetable for
implementing the year-old U.N. cease-fire plan Iran agreed to
accept last week.
   ``We also talked about the recent escalation of the war on our
border with the Iraqis,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar said he dispensed with formalities and began
peace talks Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule, because Velayati
had already arrived.
   Velayati and Perez de Cuellar discussed implementation of
Security Council Resolution 598, which was passed unanimously on
July 20, 1987 and demands an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq
war.
   The plan also calls for withdrawal to internationally recognized
borders, prisoner exchanges, peace negotiations and an
investigation to determine which side started the war.
   Iraq quickly accepted the resolution last year. Iran's
announcement of acceptance came after a string of battlefield
defeats that began in the spring.
   Before meeting the secretary-general, Velayati told reporters
that Iraq was trying to sabotage the peace process by in the past
week invading Iran and using chemical weapons ``in a large scale.''
   ``The war is still going on very seriously,'' he said, despite
Iraq's claim it was withdrawing from all Iranian territory after a
weekend offensive.
   Velayati said his talks with Perez de Cuellar were
``constructive'' and covered the steps to carry out a truce and
peace plan.
   Meanwhile, two U.N. teams were at work in Tehran, one laboring
over truce details, the other inquiring into the prisoner-of-war
situation. The cease-fire would be monitored and supervised by
about 250 U.N. peacekeeping troops.

   A newlywed couple who vanished in April, their
luxury auto left running in a downtown alley, are alive and well
and have contacted their parents from a West Coast location, police
said today.
   Wheaton College students Scott Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean,
22, had been the subject of an exhaustive two-state investigation.
   Investigators had noted that some of the circumstances
surrounding their disappearance _ the couple had been secretly
married a week earlier and talked about trips to exotic locales _
indicated they had planned to vanish.
   ``We have information that the parents have heard from Carolyn
and Scott both by letter and by telephone,'' Commander Ettore
DiVito of the Police Department's youth division said at a news
conference today.
   ``We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours'' on
the case, DiVito said. He added police may try to recover costs of
the investigation.
   Police said they believe the couple is in the San Diego area.
   The MacLean and Swanson families notified police this morning
that they had heard from their children, police said. ``The parents
are en route to the West Coast,'' said police department
spokeswoman Tina Vicini.
   Police said they did not suspect foul play in the couple's
disappearance. They refused to comment today on why the couple
dropped out of sight or on what they might have been doing in the
four months since.
   The couple were returning from a visit to Ms. MacLean's
grandmother in Flint, Mich., on April 2 and had planned to stop for
dinner in Chicago before heading for Swanson's home in Elgin, about
40 miles outside Chicago.
   Acquaintances told police the two were saving money for a trip
before their car was found in the early evening of April 2, keys
still in the ignition and most of their belongings undisturbed.
   Ms. MacLean also had bought $600 worth of clothes and made some
entries in her diary about trips to exotic locales, friends told
police.
   In June, police leared that a book, ``Hidden Hawaii: The
Adventurer's Guide,'' was checked out March 29 on Swanson's library
card, fueling speculation that they might still be alive.
   Friends at Wheaton College, a small religious school, flooded
downtown Chicago with posters of the two the weekend the couple was
reported missing and held daily prayer vigils for weeks following
the disappearance.
   Swanson, a psychology major, was scheduled to finish his course
work at Wheaton College in August.
   He also was a cadet major in the Reserve Officer Training Corps
at the school and would have been commissioned as a second
lieutenant May 15. His strong record in ROTC would have earned him
a spot in helicopter flight school in Alabama next year.
   Ms. MacLean, whose parents live in Haddonfield, N.J., was
scheduled to graduate in December with a degree in literature.

   A National Science Foundation computer
network, called the fastest public network in the nation, on
Wednesday began passing information among six supercomputer centers
and researchers at nearly 200 universities.
   The network, which replaces a slower system operated by the
foundation, is able to transmit 1.5 million bits of information
each second, the equivalent of 50 pages of single-spaced
typewritten text, the foundation said at a news briefing.
   The network allows participants to share research findings. Its
speed is exceeded only by some private networks, the foundation
said.
   The network ``is a major element in our national technical
development,'' said William A. Wulf, the foundation's assistant
director for computer and information science and engineering.
``With this in place, we expect that scientists and researchers
will find new ways to work together on multidisciplinary and
cross-regional research projects.''
   The system is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., and operated by Merit
Inc., a consortium of Michigan universities, under a $14 million,
five-year agreement.

   Hundreds of firefighters battled a fast-moving wildfire today
that forced 500 South Dakotans from their homes, while crews at
Yellowstone National Park fought the worst forest fire outbreak
there since the late 1800s.
   ``As the fire passes one area, the engines are moving ahead and
trying to get ahead,'' fire spokesman Corbin Newman said of the
blaze that destroyed four homes and damaged four others in rural
subdivisions west of Rapid City, S.D.
   The fires, fueled by drought, were among blazes burning in eight
Western and Midwestern states, where tens of thousands of acres of
forest, brush and meadow have gone up in smoke. The other states
with major fires are Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington and
Idaho, where a 1,500-acre blaze forced two dozen people from their
homes.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel planned a helicopter tour of
Yellowstone for this afternoon to survey the devastation in
America's oldest national park.
   Hodel was to visit Yellowstone's Grant Village section, scene of
some of this week's heaviest firefighting.
   Firefighters also kept watch on a 6,000-acre blaze burning six
to 10 miles west of Old Faithful. The blaze posed no immediate
threat to the famed geyser, but officials planned to use
helicopters today to start backfires with a napalm-like substance
to slow its advance.
   The fire in Rapid City was reported Tuesday afternoon, and
rapidly consumed 1,800 acres of forest and meadow in the
southwestern South Dakota area that's home to 90,000 people.
   ``There were areas where you might have a hundred acres go up at
once,'' said Rich Homann, another fire spokesman.
   One firefighter was treated for burns to the neck, a firefighter
and a resident suffered smoke inhalation, and another resident was
hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident, but none of the injuries
was serious, Newman said. The fire also burned four vehicles and
destroyed a bridge.
   Crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighters
were on the scene this morning, fire officials said.
   Four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fire
retardant to protect homes.
   By early today, the fire was 50 percent contained despite light
wind, Newman said.
   ``The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it
creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by
sucking in oxygen,'' he said.
   To make matters worse, winds were expected to pick up today,
temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rain
was forecast.
   Most of the evacuees in Rapid City found lodging with friends
and relatives, said Lyle Baker of the American Red Cross. About 60
families responded to a Red Cross appeal for people to open their
homes to evacuees, Baker said.
   ``We're spending more time now coordinating between family
members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Some
family members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation.
   At Yellowstone, about 500 firefighters remained on the lines
near Grant Village, a camping and store complex about 15 miles
southeast of Old Faithful that was evacuated last weekend. Fire
also closed the road from the village to the park's southern
entrance and closed the Lewis Lake campground.
   It was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the
10,000-acre Grant Village blaze, said Joan Anzelmo, a park
spokeswoman.
   The fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively fought
within park boundaries. Two fires straddling the park and adjacent
national forests are being suppressed from the forest side only,
officials said.
   Park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if they
threaten people or structures.
   In all, about 83,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres have
been blackened. Unusually hot, dry conditions this summer have left
Yellowstone and the rest of northwestern Wyoming tinder-box dry.
   ``The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the
late 1800s,'' said Larry Caplinger, a Forest Service official
coordinating firefighting.

   Three seafood company owners accused of
smuggling a million pounds of marijuana into Florida's Gulf Coast
were arrested Wednesday on federal drug charges.
   Four other men were at large on an indictment which accuses them
of sailing the marijuana to the coast in freighters, then putting
it in small speed boats.
   Federal agents also raided seafood companies in Miami, Marathon
and Key West to seize cars and boats allegedly used in the
operation, authorities said.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Magri described the three arrested men as
managers who dealt with independent contractors to unload and stash
the illegal drugs.
   ``This indictment gives a good view of narcotics trafficking in
the state of Florida,'' Magri said.
   The three in custody were Moises Pedro Arguez, 49, of Marathon,
owner of Bonefish Bay Seafood Co., with locations in Miami and
Marathon; Manuel Enrique Dobal, 47, of Miami, part-owner of Gulf
Seafood in Key West, and Santiago Arencibia, 48, of Key West, also
part-owner of Gulf Seafood.
   ``These people used the entire coast of Florida _ they were
prime movers of dope out of Everglades City,'' said Mike Powers of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ``They ranged up the
coast ... with offload sites from Everglades City to Cedar Key.''

   A man who telephoned his ex-girlfriend as many as
100 times an hour and rammed her car from behind was given
probation and ordered to stop bothering her after he pleaded guilty
to a felony retaliation charge.
   Undeterred by her repeated rejections, David Eric Herd, 23,
called the 25-year-old receptionist at home and work continuously
between July and September 1987.
   ``I tried to do it (to break up) gently, but he wouldn't let
me,'' the woman said Tuesday.
   After prosecutors dropped two misdemeanor harassment charges,
Herd pleaded guilty to retaliation in an Aug. 20, 1987, incident in
which he followed the woman and began bumping the back of her car.
   When she got out, he threw her to the ground, prosecutor Jim
West said. A passer-by ended the fracas by spraying Herd with the
woman's can of chemical deterrent.
   State District Judge Bob Burdette ordered Herd to undergo
psychiatric treatment and have no further contact with the woman or
her family. Herd also received two years of probation called
deferred adjudication, meaning that if he completes his sentence he
could emerge with no final conviction.
   Prosecutors likened the case to the movie ``Fatal Attraction,''
in which an obsessive woman refuses to let a man end a brief affair.
   But Herd's lawyer, Robert Hirschhorn of Galveston, said, ``This
isn't `Fatal Attraction.' This is modern romances.''
   He said the victim helped Herd post bond on the first harassment
case and even spent time with him just before the Aug. 20 incident.

   An Army lover of a soldier infected
with the AIDS virus testified they continued to have sex after she
learned of his fatal disease, and two superiors said they urged but
didn't order him to abstain.
   The soldiers were among 10 prosecution witnesses to testify
Tuesday at the court-martial of Pvt. Adrian G. Morris Jr., who in
March 1987 became the first member of the military to be charged
with AIDS-related offenses.
   Morris, 28, of Caseyville, Ill., is accused of threatening the
health of one male and two female soldiers by failing to use
condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus.
   His trial opened Tuesday after more than a year's delay. The
prosecution and defense rested today and the case was recessed
until the afternoon. Closing arguments were to be made in writing
or orally.
   Morris is charged with three counts of aggravated assault, three
of conduct bringing discredit upon the Army and one of sodomy. He
faces 17 years in prison, dishonorable discharge and loss of all
pay and benefits if convicted.
   Col. Raymond D. Cole, the military judge in the case, said he
would allow the prosecution to submit previous testimony from an
alleged victim of Morris' because the witness, former Pvt. Anthony
L. Baldwin, could not be located.
   Both female soldiers testified Tuesday. One was identified by
pseudonym Jane Doe after Cole agreed to protect her identity
because of her psychological health.
   The other, Morris' onetime fiancee, Specialist Patricia C.
Pruitt, testified that Morris told her in 1986 he had ``an
incurable blood disease'' but didn't say it was AIDS until January
1987. She said they had sex weekly from April to October 1986, with
Morris using a condom about 25 percent of the time.
   She also said they resumed sexual relations during January 1987,
even though she knew Morris' test results showed he had AIDS.
   She said she understood the risk, and that both she and her
child, born last year and allegedly fathered by Morris, have tested
negative for the AIDS virus.
   Earlier, two Army commanders testified that they advised Morris
to abstain from sexual activity after testing positive, but never
ordered him to do so or warned him that his sexual conduct could be
a crime.
   Col. Warren A. Todd, a physician who formerly commanded the
hospital at Fort Huachuca, said Morris was distraught at the news
that he was infected, reacting with shock.
   ``He put his head in his hands. I remember he said, `Why me, why
me, why me?''' Todd testified.
   Morris' former commanding officer, Capt. Bernard E. Kulifay Jr.,
said he had counseled Morris ``strictly man-to-man'' on several
occasions between July 1986 and March 1987 about Morris' medical
condition.
   He said he advised Morris that ``he should not screw around.''
   Jane Doe said she had sex twice with Morris in August 1986. She
said Morris had told her previously ``he had a rare blood disease
and he could die at any moment,' but did not mention HIV or AIDS.
   Last April, the Army adopted a regulation requiring commanders
to warn soldiers testing positive for the AIDS virus that they face
discharge or prosecution if they don't tell sex partners about
their condition or use condoms. The Air Force and Navy have adopted
similar regulations.
   Morris' court-martial was delayed pending appeals of a blood
test admissibility ruling. In the interim, several other military
AIDS-related cases have been tried.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-congressman has lost a $1.8 million
defamation lawsuit against a Portland newspaper that published a
story about the way he handled campaign funds.
   Former Rep. Jim Weaver, D-Ore., sued the Oregonian Publishing
Co. and a National Republican Congressional Committee lawyer
following a 1986 article in The Oregonian questioning Weaver's
handling of more than $81,900 of campaign funds.
   U.S. District Judge Malcolm F. Marsh on Friday granted a
pretrial judgment in favor of the publishing company which said
Weaver could not seek damages because the First Amendment protects
``neutral and accurate republication'' of serious charges against a
public figure.
   Weaver contended in the lawsuit that publication of the
allegations about the campaign money had contributed to his
withdrawal from a U.S. Senate race against incumbent Bob Packwood
in 1986.
   The Oregonian article was based on a report prepared by Benjamin
Ginsberg, an attorney for the Republican committee. Weaver
contended that four statements about alleged mingling of funds and
alleged violations of reporting sections of federal election law
had damaged his reputation.
   In a written opinion, Marsh said one of the alleged defamatory
statements was an ``accurate paraphrase'' of Ginsberg's report and
the remaining three were direct quotations from the report.
   Weaver voluntarily dismissed Ginsberg as a defendant.
   David C. Force, a Eugene lawyer representing Weaver, said he
could not comment on the ruling because Weaver had not seen it.

<TEXT>
   A judge who got into an argument with an
attorney over use of her maiden name in court has been sued by the
attorney's client, who believes he lost his racial discrimination
case because of the controversy.
   Charles Gavin said in a complaint filed Monday in federal court
that Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum politicized a
six-member jury when he initiated the argument with attorney
Barbara Wolvovitz.
   The suit said Teitelbaum shouted at Wolvovitz when the
controversy erupted July 8 and threatened her with jail if she
refused to use her husband's surname and the courtesy title
``Mrs.'' in his courtroom.
   Gavin, 43, said Teitelbaum tampered with the jury by polling
them on the issue and prejudiced them against his case. After the
outburst, Gavin said, ``The jury belonged to the judge.''
   The jury eventually decided PPG Industries Inc. had not
discriminated against Gavin and another complainant, William
Sutton, 33. Gavin and Sutton have appealed, saying their case ``got
lost in the shuffle'' of the Ms. vs. Mrs. controversy.
   Teitelbaum eventually said he would refer to Wolvowitz as
counselor and apologized for his remarks after the case went to the
jury.
   A secretary in Teitelbaum's office said Wednesday the judge
would not comment on the latest suit.
   Gavin, who said he is serving as his own attorney because he can
no longer afford legal help, asked for a finding that his civil
rights were violated and for more than $10,000 in damages. He said
he is aware that suits against judges are rarely successful.
   Robert Cindrich, a former U.S. attorney, noted that ``in
general, federal judges enjoy immunity from civil suit,
particularly from suits arising out of their judicial function.''

<TEXT>
   A judge on Wednesday ordered doctors to
remove a feeding tube from a woman left brain-damaged in a 1983
automobile accident, and her parents called it a ``bittersweet
victory'' for her family.
   Thad McCanse, a court-appointed guardian who acted as Nancy
Cruzan's advocate during court hearings and advocated letting her
die, said there would be no immediate steps taken to disconnect her
from her feeding tube.
   McCanse said he would join the state in filing an appeal of
Jasper County Circuit Judge Robert Teel's ruling.
   ``In order to protect her I want an appellate court to make the
decision,'' he said. ``It is an issue of life and death and we
should take it as far as we can.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 30, who is being care for at the State
Rehabilitation Center at Mount Vernon, has no higher-brain
functions, a permanent condition doctors call a persistent
vegetative state.
   Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of Carterville, sued last year
to force doctors to remove a surgically implanted feeding tube and
allow their daughter to die.
   The judge said he considered their request the ``same as a
request for discontinuance of any other form of artificial life
support systems'' despite arguments that food supplies may not be
cut off.
   ``We are pleased by the judge's decision,'' Cruzan said. ``We
feel it was very brave and courageous on his part. It's kind of a
bittersweet victory for my family but it's a victory for Nancy.''
   In emotional testimony during a three-day hearing in March, Ms.
Cruzan's family said she had made clear that she would not want to
endure in a helpless and hopeless state.
   ``Nancy would want to live where she could live to the
fullest,'' her sister, Christy White of Neosho, testified. ``And
where she can live to the fullest is within the hearts of the
people who love her, not in that body being maintained at Mount
Vernon.''
   Assistant state Attorney General Robert Presson argued that food
and water are basic necessities that should not be denied anyone.

   A former town judge should be barred from
judicial office for life for soliciting oral sex from a defendant
and threatening to have her dog killed if she told, a state
judicial watchdog panel said Wednesday.
   The woman was trying to pay a $10 fine for letting her dog run
loose when the judge said he'd give her $25 for a sex act, said the
state Commission on Judicial Conduct.
   The woman threw a $10 bill at the judge and refused his offer,
the commission said.
   The judge, Gerald Molnar, 29, was a $2,500-a-year part-time town
justice in Madrid, near the St. Lawrence River on the border with
Canada, at the time. He resigned last April 26, a day before the
commission held a hearing on the case.
   The panel recommended to the state Court of Appeals, New York's
highest court, that Molnar be prohibited from holding judicial
office again because of the May 1, 1987, incident.
   Molnar, a food service worker at the state's Ogdensburg
Correctional Facility, has 30 days to appeal.
   Molnar did not submit any defense during the commission's
hearings, the panel said. Molnar's lawyer, Duncan MacAffer, was on
vacation and couldn't be reached for comment, said a secretary at
MacAffer's office in Albany.
   The judicial panel saidturday.
   The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station WEEI in Boston,
found Dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for Bush. The
poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential
candidates after their nominating conventions.
   Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin of
error of four points.

   Three East Germans escaped to the West in two
separate incidents, but an East Berlin man was caught while riding
a subway train headed for the city's western sector, officials said
Wednesday.
   A 15-year-old boy and a 25-year-old man fled to West Germany in
a rubber raft across the Baltic Sea on Tuesday, said West German
border police in Bad Bramstedt, about 25 miles north of Hamburg.
   They were picked up by a ship, brought to Sweden and taken to
West Germany, police said, without giving any other details.
   An East German border guard fled to the southern West German
state of Bavaria the same day, West German border police said.
   The 21-year-old sergeant crossed over from East Germany wearing
his uniform and his service pistol, police said.
   In Berlin, witnesses said communist border guards arrested a man
who had evaded border police and hopped on a West Berlin-bound
subway train Tuesday night.
   The train had just departed from the East Berlin
Friedrichstrasse station when it was stopped by the guards,
witnesses said.

   George Bush, in an unusual step, plans to go
to New Orleans one week before the Republican National Convention
to address the party's platform committee and ``put his stamp of
approval on the platform,'' a campaign official said today.
   Bush, facing a deadline in three weeks, is also stepping up his
search for a running mate, asking candidates if they're interested
in being considered and planning to use polling to determine the
popularity of different people.
   The convention opens in New Orleans on Aug. 15, and Bush isn't
scheduled to arrive that week until Aug. 17, the next-to-last day
of the gathering. However, deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said
today, he will make a one-day trip to the convention city on Aug. 8
for the platform meeting.
   Bush's list of possible running mates was expanded Tuesday when
Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire said he had received
questionnaire forms that Bush is using in his search. Bush already
had said that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas would be
among those considered.
   A Bush campaign official said the staff was contacting various
people to see if they wanted to be considered.
   ``Preliminary interest is being ascertained. I think you're safe
to assume it's more than John Sununu,'' the official said,
insisting on anonymity and refusing to identify who else was being
contacted.
   Within Republican circles, other people considered as likely
candidates include Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and California Gov.
George Deukmejian, even though he has said he is not interested in
the job.
   Washington lawyer Robert M. Kimmitt has been asked to begin
background checks on several potential vice presidential picks, The
Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   Bush told the newspaper that Kimmitt will report directly to him
rather than the campaign staff, to better maintain confidentiality
in the information provided by the prospective running mates.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairwoman of Bush's campaign
committee, said it's clear that some women are being considered.
   ``One of the nicest surprises for me is hearing ... many
conservative members of my party talking about a woman on the
ticket as a good idea,'' said the congresswoman, whose name has
appeared on some public lists of possible running mates.
   She said other strong candidates include former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr.
   However, Rep. Martin said the selection of a woman was
``possible, not probable.''
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, has
said he wants to keep his running mate a secret until the
Republican National Convention, which opens Aug. 15 in New Orleans.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said the vice
president ``has expressed an interest in selective polling being
done as one aspect of the process'' for winnowing names.
   ``The polling has not started,'' she added.
   Despite the public speculation about his running mate, Bush
trained his public focus on another subject Tuesday, delivering a
speech at the Library of Congress before congressional interns
about the ethical standards he would set if elected president.
   He said Congress should be covered by the same
conflict-of-interest laws that govern federal officials and that
civil penalities as well as criminal sanctions should be used to
punish violators.
   Bush said that under the current system, an official is charged
either with a felony or nothing at all. ``This is plainly
unacceptable,'' the vice president said.
   Breaking with the Reagan administration, Bush also endorsed the
use of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing by federal
officials, and said Congress should come under the same law.
   ``To exempt Congress from any of these rules, as does current
conflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standard that
breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and, in my judgment, breeds
abuse,'' he said. ``No one, no institution, no body of government
should be above the law.''
   In Boston, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
criticized Bush for taking a ``do-nothing'' approach to Attorney
General Edwin Meese's legal difficulties. In his speech, Bush said
he wasn't going to comment on matters surrounding Meese, as well as
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the subject of an ethics
investigation.
   Bush said the current system of federal ethics law is ``a
confused quiltwork of executive policy statements, administrative
regulations, criminal law. ... In my administration, the code of
conduct will be clear and uniform.
   ``It will reflect common sense,'' the vice president said.
``Nothing will be overly technical. What is intuitively right _
what your conscience tells you _ will invariably be the written
rule.''
   Bush said that ``the threshold for judging ethic conduct in
government is not, and should not and will not be whether an
appointee has committed a criminal offense, but whether that
individual has exercised honest, unbiased judgment and scrupulously
avoided any appearance of impropriety ... of conflict of interest.''
   Bush said he would create a White House ethics office headed by
a senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility
would be ethics. He said the office would complement the work
already done by the Office of Government Ethics, an executive
branch agency.

   Ousted Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
and his wife, Imelda, spent the night in hiding after their
security guards reported armed men cruised past the Marcos estate,
a spokesman said.
   In the Philippines, government spokesman Teodoro Benigno said
today he didn't know anything about the report of gunmen and didn't
want to comment ``because one of the world's master illusionists is
at work.''
   Three cars drove slowly past the house at about 5:30 a.m.
Tuesday, and security guards stationed at the gate of the sprawling
hillside home said they saw guns sticking out the car windows, said
Marcos' spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   The unarmed guards, who were on foot, chased the cars but could
not get a good description because it was still dark, he said. No
shots were fired.
   The Marcoses were awakened shortly after the incident and driven
to a site on Oahu, said Trinidad.
   ``They went to a friend's house,'' he said. ``They're still on
Oahu and they'll come back as soon as it's safe.''
   A Honolulu police dispatcher said the incident was not reported,
but top Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said police were asked Tuesday to
patrol the Marcos address regularly.
   Trinidad said Marcos' entourage had received a threatening call
and letter last month ``warning us that something untoward will
happen to us.''
   Aruiza said the Marcos household had been warned Tuesday of a
plot to kill Marcos.
   Security around the house was increased and the Marcoses were
expected to return home today, Aruiza said.
   The couple have lived in exile in Honolulu since 1986, when
Marcos was ousted as president of the Philippines by Corazon Aquino.
   Marcos has been negotiating his return to his homeland, but in a
statement issued by a spokesman Tuesday he denied a published
report that he had offered to pay the Philippine government $5
billion to ensure his return free from criminal prosecution on
fraud allegations.
   Marcos, family members and associates are alleged to have looted
the Philippine treasury of up to $10 billion during his 20 years in
office, sinking the money into businesses, real estate, bank
accounts, art and other holdings.
   The Village Voice in New York City reported earlier this month
that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani recommended Marcos and his wife
be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with real
estate holdings in New York.
   The White House said it could not confirm the report.

   Hours after Sri Lanka and India signed
an accord aimed at ending this nation's Tamil ethnic war, Indian
air force planes began ferrying troops to the Tamil-dominated north.
   A year later, 50,000 soldiers of the Indian army still are
deployed in Sri Lanka.
   The Tamil war goes on, into its sixth year with the death toll
at more than 8,000.
   Resentment against Indian troops grows among Tamils civilians
who first saw the foreign soldiers as protectors but who now say
they have not done their job.
   Anger at the peace accord among the majority Sinhalese has
spawned yet another revolt and more violence, and both Sinhalese
and Tamils are questioning the accord.
   Sinhalese ire was apparent even before President Junius R.
Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed the
accord on July 29, 1987.
   Rioting erupted a day earlier in the capital, and more than 70
people were killed when police opened fire to control Sinhalese
mobs. Many Sinhalese complained that the accord went too far in
giving the minority Tamils what they wanted _ a separate homeland
in the island's north and east.
   The idea of the peace accord was that Sri Lanka would grant
limited autonomy to the Tamils in those areas in return for the
Tamil fighters putting down their weapons.
   India, Sir Lanka's northern neighbor with a large Tamil
population of its own, agreed to guarantee the pact by disarming
Tamil rebels and protecting Tamil civilians from revenge by the
Sinhalese.
   It didn't work out that way. Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of
the largest Tamil militia, said the accord was forced on him by
powerful India, which sits just 30 miles from Sri Lanka, and he
rejected it.
   By October, Prabhakaran's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were
fighting the Indian army. About 2,500 Tiger guerrillas and at least
500 Indian soldiers have been killed.
   A leading Sinhalese government minister, Gamini Dissanayake,
surprised many in Sri Lanka last week when he accused India of not
fulfilling its role. Dissanayake is viewed as the prime mover
behind the treaty.
   ``It is the responsibility of India to see that the Liberation
Tigers are totally disarmed,'' the lands minister told a panel
discussion. ``The Indian army has not performed its job.''
   Gandhi and Indian Foreign Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao told their
Parliament on Wednesday that the troops will not leave until the
Tamils are disarmed.
   In the island's Sinhalese-populated south, meanwhile, a
Sinhalese nationalist group, the People's Liberation Front, has
killed more than 400 people since the accord was signed.
   Most victims were minor figures in Jayewardene's United National
Party. The front has vowed to kill any supporters of the government
and its peace accord.
   Security was strengthened at the Indian High Commission and
diplomatic residence on Wednesday after threats from the group,
according to a commission official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Indian forces have been put on alert for possible violence to
mark the first anniversary of the accord. Residents in
Tamil-dominated regions said Indian troops imposed a curfew
starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday.
   Sirimavo Bandaranaike, leader of the opposition Sri Lankan
Freedom Party, says the accord has fostered ``southern terrorism.''
   Others say Mrs. Bandaranaike's party, the largest opposition
group, has fueled Sinhalese anger by opposing the peace accord as a
tactic to win parliamentary elections expected later this year.
   A leading Freedom Party member, Anil Moonesinghe, said last week
that the treaty should be abrogated.
   ``The 1-year-old Indo-Lanka accord has not brought peace. It has
brought misery, bloodshed, tears and destruction to this country,''
Moonesinghe said.
   A Tamil member of Jayewardene's government also told The
Associated Press it may be time to reconsider the accord.
   ``Now that one year has elapsed and since the accord has not
done as anticipated, it is time for both governments to take
realities into account,'' said Savumiamoorthy Thonadman, the rural
development minister. ``The accord does not satisfy Tamils.''

<TEXT>
   A federal export program is boosting sales of
chicken to Japan, where retailers traditionally have bought
low-quality U.S. product in large quantities for the low end of the
market, an Agriculture Department official said Wednesday.
   ``Branded promotion of frozen chicken from the United States
under our Targeted Export Assistance Program is turning this
situation around,'' said Thomas O. Kay, administrator of the
Foreign Agricultural Service.
   ``The product is clean, packaging is attractive, and our exports
of chicken to Japan have risen 10 percent in the past year.''
   Kay was arguing, in testimony prepared for a Congressional
hearing, against the contention of the General Accounting Office
that U.S. government promotion of branded products such as chicken
and wine gives some companies a potentially unfair advantage. The
GAO watches over government spending for Congress.
   The program it criticized will spend $325 million a year
beginning in October, up from $110 million this year.
   ``You wouldn't dream of buying a bottle of `generic' wine,'' Kay
said.
   ``Effective promotion of U.S. wine in a foreign market means
getting a wide range of individual labels and classes of wine
established in the local trade.''
   Allen I. Mendelowitz, an official of the General Accounting
Office, said the program has been credited with boosting exports of
wine to Japan by 56 percent in the first half of this year. But he
said other causes for the increased sales, including the drop in
the price of the dollar, have to be taken into account.
   Kay said the 12-country European Economic Community dominates
world trade in processed foods.
   ``The EC has won its dominance of the market through a
comprehensive barriers and processing and export subsidies,'' he
said.
   ``The Targeted Export Assistance program has given us a way to
begin to challenge that dominance.''
   Both men testified before the House Agriculture subcommittee on
foreign agriculture.

to be unrecognized,'' said Dr. Allen J. Wilcox, who directed the
study.
   His work suggests that 22 percent of all pregnancies end
spontaneously in the first month, before women know they are
pregnant. Another 9 percent result in miscarriages after the
pregnancy becomes apparent.
   The study confirmed what many scientists have long suspected:
The female body discards a large portion of its fetuses in the
first month or so after conception.
   Wilcox said the body probably rejects fetuses because they are
defective. When researchers study later miscarriages in which fetal
tissue is recovered, they find that half show gross genetic
abnormalities.
   ``It's reasonable to speculate that the same would be true in
these very early losses,'' Wilcox said.
   The study found that 31 percent of all pregnancies ended before
birth, but the true rate of miscarriage is probably even higher,
since the test missed miscarriages during the first week after
conception.
   An editorial published with the study in the Thursday issue of
the New England Journal of Medicine speculates that half of all
pregnancies may end in miscarriage.
   Wilcox, a researcher at the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C., based his findings
on a newly available test that spots a pregnancy hormone.
   The study was conducted on 221 healthy young women who had
decided to stop using birth control and get pregnant. The
researchers collected urine and checked it for traces of human
chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced by the fetus.
   This substance shows up in a woman's urine when the fetus
attaches itself to the wall of her uterus, usually about a week
after conception.
   Wilcox noted that many physicians tell women to resume birth
control and ``let their uteruses rest'' for a few months after a
miscarriage. But he said this may not be necessary, at least after
very early pregnancy losses.
   Wilcox said the miscarriages did not mean that a woman could not
have children, and almost all of those who had unrecognized
miscarriages were able to get pregnant again within two years.
   Dr. A. Brian Little of Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, who
wrote the editorial, said in an interview that ``there are many
exciting things'' about the study.
   He said the test, which is not yet commercially available, may
allow doctors to pinpoint more accurately the causes of
infertility. For instance, if the test shows that infertile women
are having early miscarriages, it will help rule out several
possible reasons for their problems.
   Little said the test should also help doctors check on the
progress of test tube, or in vitro, fertilizations.

   Prem Tinsulanonda, the prime minister
with the longest tenure in modern Thai history, today turned down
offers to return to his post for another term, party officials said.
   One of Prem's closest supporters, Chatichai Choonhavan, agreed
to take the job. ``The leaders of the five parties agreed that they
would nominate me as prime minister and I accept,'' he told
reporters.
   Chatichai, 66, who serves as acting deputy prime minister, heads
the Thai Nation Party, which won the most votes in Sunday's general
election.
   Earlier today, Chatichai, a retired army major general and a
wealthy businessman, said he supported Prem for prime minister.
   Although the five coalition parties hold 215 of the 357 seats in
the lower house of Parliament, more lobbying may take place before
Chatichai's name is submitted to constitutional monarch Bhumibol
Adulyadej for approval.
   In the past Thailand's powerful military and senior bureaucrats
were also said to have been involved in the final choice of the
country's leader.
   The other four parties in the coalition are the Democrat Party,
the Social Action Party, the Rassadorn Party and the United
Democracy Party.
   The announcement that Prem turned down another term as prime
minister was made earlier today by Col. Sanan Kachornprasat,
secretary general of the Democrat Party. ``Prem said he won't
accept it, citing personal reasons,'' Sanan said. ``He has upheld
democracy for eight years and five months.''
   The announcement came after leaders and senior officials of five
political parties met at Prem's house to offer him the post. The
five parties had agreed to form a coalition government to be headed
by Prem following the elections.
   Prem, a 67-year-old former army commander, called the elections
24 months early after dissolving Parliament, disbanding his
faction-ridden coalition government and nullifying a no-confidence
motion from the opposition.
   Under Thai law, after elections the major parties select a prime
ministerial candidate, who does not have to be a member of
Parliament. Prem, for instance, does not hold an elective office.
   Television reported that several hours before the parties met
with Prem today 3,000 students marched to his house, protesting the
naming of a prime minister who had not been elected by the people.
Riot police guarded Prem's house and the crowd dispersed
peacefully, the report said.
   The new lower house of Parliament was scheduled to meet Monday
for the first time. Traditionally, the first session is presided
over by the king.
   On Tuesday, five representatives from the Student Federation of
Thailand, which claims 100,000 members, called on Parliament
President Ukrit Mongkolnavin to have the prime minister be directly
elected rather than nominated.

   President Reagan and Hungarian Communist Party
leader Karoly Grosz agreed today that overhauling of Hungary's
economy must be accompanied by political reforms.
   ``We have been impressed with your openness to new ideas,''
Reagan told Grosz in a formal departure statement after the two
leaders held a brief private meeting and then had lunch.
   ``We are encouraged by your recognition that economic reforms
cannot succeed unless acompanied by political reforms as well,''
the president said.
   He added that decisions to be made by Grosz' government in the
coming months ``will set the direction of Hungary's development
over the next decade.''
   Grosz, replying to the president's remarks, said Hungary ``will
reorganize its economy'' and added, ``This can only be done, we are
aware, if the citizens will enjoy more rights, more freedoms.''
   ``Therefore, we are modernizing our political system and our
political practices,'' he said.
   Grosz spoke through an interpreter.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said the two leaders did not discuss the question of
possible withdrawal of the 65,000 Soviet troops based in Hungary.
   Several weeks ago, State Department officials had received
increasing indications that a Soviet military retreat from its
Warsaw Pact ally was likely.
   Grosz told a National Press Club gathering on Tuesday that any
Soviet troop pullback from Hungary would have to be part of general
scaling down of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe.
   As Grosz began his official talks here, the troop issue was
expected to occupy only a small part of his visit as both sides
were hoping to stress his efforts to make Hungary more open
economically and politically.
   The visit is the first ever by a Hungarian party leader since
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago. Grosz became
premier a year ago and was named party chief in May.
   The United States has better relations with Hungary than any
other East European country and U.S. officials expect Grosz's visit
will reinforce those ties.
   Grosz is likely to emphasize his plans for revitalizing
Hungary's economy through an ambitious reform program that includes
closer trade and investment ties with Western countries.
   ``We will open Hungary to both foreign and Hungarian capital,''
Grosz said Tuesday, adding that he wishes to modernize the
country's political structure as well.
   Grosz is expected to seek improved Hungarian access to U.S.
markets during his visit.
   On Tuesday, he said that economic and political reform must be
carried out jointly because the two are dependent on one another.
``The two processes must be fitted together,'' he said.
   But he indicated political reform has to be carried out within
the framework of Hungary's one party state.
   Grosz indicated that it would be a mistake to focus excessively
on the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, an event that greatly
aggravated the Cold War and did much to shape Western attitudes
toward Hungary for years afterward.
   ``The events of 1956 mut not be treated as a matter of everyday
politics but as a matter of history,'' Grosz said Tuesday, speaking
through a translator.
   The Soviet invasion was touched off by a widespread anti-Moscow
uprising in Hungary. Among the legacies of that era is the
continued presence of the 65,000 Soviet soldiers in Hungary.
   Administration officials have said they would welcome a
unilateral Soviet withdrawal but maintain that any such move would
do little to alter the East-West power balance because Hungary does
not border on any NATO country.
   The officials said there had been credible hints recently that
the Soviets might announce a total troop withdrawal from Hungary.
The administration was concerned that the Soviets might try to use
such a move as a bid to pressure NATO countries into making
withdrawals of their own from the European theater.
   The administration prefers that force withdrawals be negotiated
to ensure that concessions are parallel.
   Grosz arrived in the United States last week, visiting Illinois,
California and New York. The latter stop included a 45-minute chat
with Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. He met with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz after his arrival Tuesday in
Washington.

<HEAD>B-1B Able To Perform Only Half Its Intended Tasks, Pentagon Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force's B-1B bomber, already behind
schedule in meeting its warfare goals, now will accomplish about
half of the job for which it was designed, a Pentagon testing
official said Wednesday.
   Asked to give the airplane an overall rating for how well it
could perform its jobs of pentrating enemy airspace and surviving
counterattacks, John E. Krings, director of testing for the Defense
Department, said, ``It will accomplish about 50 percent in terms of
the gross assessment of what it was supposed to do.''
   While the plane generally flies and handles well, electronic
equipment that enables it to follow a ground-hugging flight path
and avoid or confuse enemy radar remains a problem, Krings told a
joint meeting of two House Armed Services subcommittees.
   But even with the problems, the B-1B still exceeds the
capabilities of some other planes in the U.S. arsenal, he added.
   Chief among the problem areas is the plane's electronic
countermeasures system, which is designed to help the aircraft slip
through enemy radar. The system has been unable to handle the job
of detecting and processing the range of possible threats from air
defense systems, Krings said.
   The problem is exacerbated by the inability of the electronic
system to adapt to the changing nature of radars used for
surveillance, tracking and weapons guidance, he said.
   The Air Force has given up on trying to meet all the original
hopes for the countermeasures system and is instead focusing on a
narrower range of threats, hoping to develop reliable performance
against enemy anti-aircraft weapons, he said.
   ``It's better to have success in a limited area than no success
in a large area,'' he said. ``There is no question that it doesn't
accomplish everything it was supposed to.''
   The United States is buying 100 of the aircraft at a total cost
of more than $20 billion. The B-1 program was killed by President
Carter, who decided that it would be more cost-effective for the
Air Force to wait for development of the radar-eluding Stealth
bomber, due for deployment in the early 1990s. But the plane was
revived by the Reagan administration as part of its defense buildup.
   ``Jimmy Carter's decision looks better as we keep going through
these hearings,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.

<HEAD>U.S. Prepared To Meet With `Responsible Palestinians'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration renewed its offer
Wednesday to meet with ``responsible Palestinians'' in an effort to
spur Mideast peace talks, but said it would not retreat from its
policy barring direct contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy told reporters
that ``I hope to have meetings with Palestinians'' when he tours
the Middle East next month and makes stops in Israel, Jordan, Syria
and Egypt. ``But there is no dramatic new initiative under way,''
he said during an informal interview on Capitol Hill.
   Murphy and other officials were responding to questions
triggered by remarks of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who said
in a state-owned newspaper interview that the United States was
ready to talk with PLO members so long as they are not prominent in
the organization.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said ``There's no
change in our policy toward the PLO, in U.S. government contacts
with the PLO.''
   The policy prohibits dealing with Yasser Arafat's organization
until it accepts Israel's right to exist and disavows terrorism
against American and Israeli citizens.
   Murphy's trip to the region could be a forerunner of a fifth
visit this year by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Before
going, Murphy will meet in Geneva next Monday and Tuesday with
Vladimir Polyakov, the senior Soviet foreign ministry expert on the
Middle East.
   Shultz invited Palestinians to meet with him in Jerusalem, but
was snubbed at the instruction of the PLO. The PLO also refused to
approve a proposal that Palestinian representatives negotiate with
Israel as part of a Jordanian delegation.
   On all his trips, however, rumors apparently inspired by the PLO
circulated that Shultz was about to have a meeting in this Arab
capital or that with prominent members of the group.
   Redman said Murphy ``as usual will be prepared to meet with
responsible Palestinians on the same basis that Secretary of State
Shultz has offered to do on his trips to the Middle East.''
   And yet, the spokesman said, the U.S. policy on the PLO was
`'very categorical.''
   Mubarak, meanwhile, said the meetings would be held either in
Cairo or Amman. Mubarak told the weekly Al-Mussawar that Murphy
wanted to meet both with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
and from other countries.
   While the Egyptian leader supports U.S. peace efforts, he
differs sharply with Shultz in insisting on a direct role for the
PLO in the process.
   Shultz met earlier this year in Washington with two members of
the Palestine National Council, the would-be legislative arm of a
Palestinian state. One of the Palestinians, Edward Said, a Columbia
University English professor, said he had a ``green light'' from
Arafat for the session.
   Apart from U.S. restraints on contacts with the PLO, which were
imposed 13 years ago, Shultz has barred participation by the
Palestinian group in negotiations with Israel.
   His attempt to spur peace talks has stalled over Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to pledge to withdraw from the
West Bank and Gaza and demands by King Hussein of Jordan for a
guaranteed Israeli pullout.
   Shultz's return to the region was predicted earlier this month
by Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah after talks here
with senior State Department officials.
   Redman said Murphy's trip was ``not necessarily'' a precursor of
one by Shultz. The spokesman added: ``There are not any plans for a
trip by the secretary at this stage ... But if there is something
to do in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world the
secretary will do it.''
   One of the main issues Shultz wants Israel and the Arabs to take
up is the future of the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the
Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza. Violent demonstrations against
Israeli control have taken the lives of more than 200 in the last
seven months.

   An Armenian activist said he was forced to fly to
Ethiopia under KGB guard after his expulsion from the Soviet Union,
but he won a promise after a hunger strike that his family could
join him in exile in the West.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan told The Associated Press by telephone from
Addis Ababa that he was being cared for by the local Armenian
community and had been assured refuge in the United States for
himself and nine family members.
   The 39-year-old activist, who played a prominent role in a
recent struggle between Armenians and Azerbaijanis for control of
the Nagorno-Karabakh region, said he had not seen or spoken to his
wife since his March 25 arrest.
   Ayrikyan said he would never abandon efforts to return to his
native Armenia, but that he wanted his family with him in exile.
   He said he had been told by U.S. and Ethiopian authorities that
he would be able to leave Addis Ababa in a few days and will stay
with relatives in France untili his family can join him. They plan
to settle in Los Angeles, where they have other relatives that they
have never met, he said.
   The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa said Ayrikyan was in good health
and met with U.S. officials Wednesday to start preparing for his
settlement in Los Angeles. An embassy source told The AP that the
case was being given priority.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Ayrikyan's wife and family in Moscow also requested resettlement in
the United States, and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is processing
them as refugees.
   Ayrikyan, who had served 17 years in Soviet prisons and labor
camps before his release last year following a government review of
political sentencings, was expelled from the Soviet Union last
week. His expulsion followed the Kremlin's rejection of an appeal
by Armenians for annexation of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region
in the Caucasus Mountains.
   He is believed to be the first Soviet dissident expelled to the
Kremlin's African ally. The unusual action may indicate Soviet
concern about how their traditional allies in Eastern Europe would
respond if asked to take part in a punitive measure against a
dissident.
   Western nations, including the United States, had refused to
accept the nationalist because he was being expelled by Soviet
authorities against his will.
   He had been jailed in the Armenian capital of Yerevan since
March 25 on charges of slandering the Soviet state. The accusations
stemmed from his reports to Western journalists on the Armenian
campaign for control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   His family was allowed no contact with him since his arrest and
did not know his whereabouts until late Tuesday when he telephoned
his mother-in-law, Nina Sidorenko, from Ethiopia.
   Ayrikyan said he had gone on a hunger strike when authorities
informed him he was being expelled, and he abandoned it Tuesday
when Soviet diplomats in Addis Ababa told U.S. envoys that his
family would be allowed to join him.
   Theresa Masras, an Armenian emigre married to an Ethiopian
businessman, said the head of the Ethiopian capital's Armenian
community brought Ayrikyan to her home for help in arranging refuge
in the United States.
   ``Everyone is helping him, there's no need to worry,'' said Mrs.
Masras.
   Ayrikyan, speaking from his room at the Hotel Ethiopia, said the
local Armenians had been taking good care of him.
   Calls to the home of Ayrikyan's wife in Armenia did not go
through on Wednesday, but Mrs. Sidorenko said her daughter managed
to call her early in the day and was informed about Ayrikyan's
location and plans.
   In what may be a related development, Ethiopian leader Mengistu
Haile Mariam arrived in Moscow on Monday for what the Tass news
agency described as ``a brief working visit.'' Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials met with him Tuesday, but
a Tass account of that and other meetings made no mention of
Ayrikyan's case.
   Ayrikyan gained notoriety and official ire earlier this year
when he provided information to Western reporters in Moscow about
the Armenian drive for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenians make up more than three quarters of the disputed
region's 162,000 population, and athey had complained of
discrimination at the hands of their Azerbaijani leaders.
   Following a harsh speech by Gorbachev warning about the dangers
of nationalism in this multi-ethnic nation, the Kremlin leadership
decreed on July 18 that Nagorno-Karabakh will stay in the
Azerbaijan republic.
   Tass reported on July 20 that Ayrikyan had been expelled after
he ``created a crisis in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.''

   East German figure skating star Katarina Witt will
be paid nearly $4 million to tour in Europe with the American-owned
Holiday on Ice show, sources in East Berlin said Wednesday.
   The 22-year-old retired two-time Olympic champion will receive
about 20 percent of the sum, most of it in East German marks, said
the sources, who were close to negotiations between Holiday on Ice
and East German sports officials.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said Witt is expected to
receive about $750,000, although only about 20 percent would be
paid in Western currency. The remainder will go to the East German
sports federation, according to the sources.
   On Tuesday, Holiday on Ice officials said Witt would received a
record sum for her five guest appearances on the show's European
tour, but declined to give a precise figure.

   Country music singer Johnny Paycheck,
best known for his song, ``Take This Job and Shove It,'' showed up
for the third day of a trial for 10 members of the Hells Angels
motorcycle club.
   ``I've been friends with them for 13 or 14 years,'' said
Paycheck, who traveled from Nashville, Tenn., to drop in on the
trial Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   Paycheck, 50, said one of his best friends among the Hells
Angels is Ralph ``Sonny'' Barger Jr., of Oakland, Calif., the
club's national lresident suffered smoke inhalation, and another resident
was
hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident, but none of the injuries
was serious, Newman said. The fire also burned four vehicles and
destroyed a bridge.
   Crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighters
were on the scene this morning, fire officials said.
   Four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fire
retardant to protect homes.
   By early today, the fire was 50 percent contained despite light
wind, Newman said.
   ``The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that it
creates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind by
sucking in oxygen,'' he said.
   To make matters worse, winds were expected to pick up today,
temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rain
was forecast.
   Most of the evacuees in Rapid City found lodging with friends
and relatives, said Lyle Baker of the American Red Cross. About 60
families responded to a Red Cross appeal for people to open their
homes to evacuees, Baker said.
   ``We're spending more time now coordinating between family
members to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Some
family members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation.
   At Yellowstone, about 500 firefighters remained on the lines
near Grant Village, a camping and store complex about 15 miles
southeast of Old Faithful that was evacuated last weekend. Fire
also closed the road from the village to the park's southern
entrance and closed the Lewis Lake campground.
   It was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the
10,000-acre Grant Village blaze, said Joan Anzelmo, a park
spokeswoman.
   The fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively fought
within park boundaries. Two fires straddling the park and adjacent
national forests are being suppressed from the forest side only,
officials said.
   Park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if they
threaten people or structures.
   In all, about 83,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres have
been blackened. Unusually hot, dry conditions this summer have left
Yellowstone and the rest of northwestern Wyoming tinder-box dry.
   ``The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the
late 1800s,'' said Larry Caplinger, a Forest Service official
coordinating firefighting.

   Ronald McDonald beware _ a robot that pops
out cups of sizzling french fries in 30 seconds is after you.
   For 80 cents the ``Spud Factory,'' a high-tech Canadian vending
machine, drops a single order of sliced tubers into hot vegetable
oil, fries them and dumps the resulting morsels into a cardboard
cup.
   ``One day you're going to drive up to McDonald's and get a
hamburger, french fries and a drink out of a vending machine,''
said Brian Haskins, a founder of Robotic Vending Services Inc. of
San Jose, which holds the U.S. distribution rights.
   ``More and more, people are going to be eating high-quality food
in vending format,'' said Haskins.
   For 60 years, inventors have struggled to develop a vending
machine that can deliver fresh french fries. To be successful, the
machine must be able to refrigerate the potato strips while keeping
the oil hot. It also must be fireproof.
   Company president Lee C. Benjamin finally found a machine that
met the criteria. Operated by a microprocessor, it costs $6,500 and
is made by Canadian Manoir Industries of Toronto.
   For now, the sole user of the ``Spud Factory'' is the Navy. Last
month, the company installed seven machines at Moffett Field Naval
Air Station in Mountain View, just west of San Jose. It plans to
install additional machines at three San Francisco Bay naval air
stations and a hospital.
   ``The first time I tried it, the potatoes were all broken. But
since then, it's been great. They taste real good,'' said Dinah
Ruiz, a food service clerk who visits the machines several times a
week. ``My kids love them.''
   Marketing director Tony Rivera said he and his partners are
attempting to profit by combining a craze for potatoes with a craze
for vending machines. The average American consumes more than 40
pounds of potatoes a year and vending machines make up a $20
billion industry.
   Robotic Vending plans to place 4,000 machines throughout
California before spreading to the rest of the country. With an
expected average of 50 sales a day per machine, the company hopes
to bring in $56 million in annual revenues _ no small potatoes.
   The company plans to first zero in on larger clients, such as
hospitals and stadiums, said Rivera.
   ``Right now we are the only company in the U.S. that has a
vending machine that is certified. Everyone else is using machines
that they are basically testing,'' Rivera said.
   One of those others is Ore-Ida Foods, a subsidiary of H.J. Heinz
Co. in Pittsburgh, which is developing a similar machine.

Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At the Guandong Market in east Beijing, shop
attendant Xing Hua spent all day Wednesday turning away customers
seeking to buy the potent Maotai liquor stacked in the back of the
store.
   ``We're not selling the good stuff until tomorrow,'' she said.
``When the prices go up, that's when we're allowed to sell.''
   At the Chongwen Market near Maxims, Yu Zhiping has been refusing
requests to buy famed Zhonghua cigarettes, despite the pile of a
dozen boxes near her counter.
   ``Come back tomorrow,'' she said, with the curt officiousness of
a Beijing shopkeeper. ``Even if you clearly see them that doesn't
mean they're for sale.''
   On Thursday, brand-name cigarettes such as Zhonghua and spirits
such as Maotai and Fenjiu, will jump in price by as much as 290
percent. Across Beijing, stores have been stocking up on the goods
in anticipation of the price rise.
   Shopkeepers said government regulations forbade them from
selling the goods before Thursday.
   The price increase was announced Monday by the State Council, or
cabinet, and comes as a time of record inflation in China.
   Consumer prices in June were 19 percent higher than in the same
month last year, the State Statistics Bureau announced last week.
That jump represented the highest inflation rate in China since the
communist victory in 1949. The previous high was last year when
inflation hit 7.2 percent.
   Shopkeepers in three large stores in Beijing said there had been
no panic buying of the brand-name goods for the simple reason that
none of the stores was selling them.
   Only some of the B-grade products, also set to increase in
price, were available and were selling briskly.
   At Chongwen, one shop attendant said that in two days he had
sold 200 cases of Erguotou Wine, a turpentine-like liquor set to
rise from about 50 cents to 65 cents.
   ``We've got to sell this liquor now,'' said the attendant who
declined to give his name. ``Otherwise, when it goes up, no one
will buy it.''
   The cigarette and liquor price rises are the second major
increase ordered this year. On May 10, the government raised the
prices of vegetables, pork, sugar and eggs as part of far-reaching
price reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and
allowing the value of goods to be determined by the market.
   The Beijing Daily on Tuesday reported that the main reason for
the newest price increase was to counteract a flourishing black
market in brand-name liquor and cigarettes.
   Private dealers bribe managers of state-run stores for a chance
to buy a large portion of their brand-name cigarette and liquor
inventory. The products then turn up on the street at inflated
prices.
   For example, a bottle of Maotai, with an official price set at
$5.40, would sell for $40.50 on the black market.
   But on Wednesday, the official Maotai price will rise to the
black market level.
   ``The money that really should have come to the country is
flowing into the pockets of profiteers,'' the paper said. ``Because
of this, after serious thought, the State Council has decided to
decontrol the prices of famous cigarettes and liquor.''
   The State Council said it would not carry out any other price
increases this year so as to curb the high inflation rate.
   On the eve of another price rise, however, there was some
skepticism.
   ``They're just waiting until everyone forgets that,'' said
Chongwen customer Zhang Da, carrying two bottles of wine and two
cartons of cigarettes. ``They say they won't raise prices, but they
will.''

<TEXT>
   The publisher of books by such
authors as Dylan Thomas, Elia Kazan and Robert Conquest said
Wednesday he's selling off his assets to pay creditors.
   Sol Stein, a major owner of the 25-year-old Stein & Day
publishing company, said he would sell the rights for 1,200 book
titles which he estimates are worth as much as $5 million.
   The company has already sold the rights to nine titles by
thriller author Jack Higgins to Simon & Schuster for $270,000,
Stein said.
   The publishing house filed for protection from creditors under
the federal bankruptcy code in June 1987, citing debts totaling
$10.1 million and assets of $7.9 million.
   However, the company's two major creditors, Michigan National
Bank and Bookcrafters USA, Inc., a distributor, are not willing to
defer payment and allow the firm to continue publishing.
   Last week, the company received permission from the court to
sell its only other major asset, its 11.3-acre headquarters.
   The building and grounds will be sold for at least $1.5 million
to a development company that plans to turn it into a single-family
residential development.
   Stein said a delay in his $11.3 million breach of contract suit
against a second distributor has added to his company's financial
problems.
   Even if he wins the suit, he said, it will be too late to save
Stein & Day.

<HEAD>Americans Eating Their Way to Early Graves, Surgeon General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans are waddling their way
to early graves by consuming too much fat, too much salt and
washing it all down with too much booze, the U.S. surgeon general
reported on Wednesday.
   ``Diseases of dietary excess and imbalance'' are among the
leading causes of death in the United States, said the report
issued by C. Everett Koop. ``Over-consumption ... is now a major
concern for Americans.''
   The study said that of 2.1 million Americans who died last year,
nearly 1.5 million succumbed to diseases associated with diet.
   ``What we eat may affect our risk for several of the leading
causes of death for Americans, notably coronary heart disease,
stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and some types of cancer,'' the
report said. ``These disorders together now account for more than
two-thirds of all deaths in the United States.''
   The study said that many Americans are too fat, while others
fail to get required nutrients such as calcium and iron. And the
report repeatedly emphasized the need to cut down on consumption of
animal products and replace them with a greater variety of foods,
particularly fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
   Nutrition experts praised the report, predicting that may have
an important impact on how Americans regard their diet and on
products sold by the food industry.
   ``This is really the first report by the Surgeon General
relating nutrition to health. With his prestige, it could have an
influence,'' said Paul Lachance, a professor of food science at
Rutgers University.
   ``It's a very good report,'' said Dr. John LaRosa, a physician
at the George Washington University and chairman of the nutrition
committee at the American Heart Association. ``It endorses ideas
that the heart association has been pushing for some time.''
   Charles J. Carey, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said the report will encourage companies to develop
products that follow the guidelines endorsed in the report.
   Though the report acknowledges that malnutrition remains a
problem in some parts of the world and for certain Americans, it
says that ``for most of us the more likely problem has become one
of overeating _ too many calories for our activity levels and an
imbalance in the nutrients consumed along with them.''
   Koop said in a forward to the report that while many foods
affect health, the major factor in the American diet ``is the
disproportionate consumption of foods high in fats, often at the
expense of foods high in complex carbohydrates and fiber _ such as
vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products.''
   Changes in the diet, he said, ``can bring a substantial measure
of better health to all Americans.''
   The report, which totals 712 pages and cites more than 2,000
scientific studies from around the world, makes recommendations
ranging from the amount of fat that should be in the diet to advice
about vitamin supplements.
   Among the major findings:
   _Most people should reduce the consumption of fat, especially
saturated fats, such as from butter or untrimmed red meat. It
suggests more vegetables and fruits, fish, poultry, lean meats and
low-fat dairy products.
   _More whole grain foods, cereal products, vegetables and fruits
should be in the diet. The report recommends that dried beans and
peas be used as a source of protein to replace some animal products.
   _Sodium consumption should be reduced by limiting the use of
salt in food preparation and at the table.
   _Alcohol intake should be reduced to two drinks a day ``if at
all.'' Pregnant women should avoid any alcohol, it said.
   _Fluoride should be added to community water systems to prevent
tooth decay, and that the consumption of sugar should be limited to
avoid dental cavities.
   _Adolescent girls and women should increase consumption of foods
high in calcium, such as low-fat dairy products.
   _Iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish, cereals, beans and
whole-grain cereals, are particularly important for children,
adolescents and women of childbearing age. ``This issue is of
special concern for low-income families,'' the report said.
   Heavy emphasis was placed in the report on dietary fat, which it
said increases risks for obesity, some types of cancer, gallbladder
and heart disease.
   ``Dietary fat accounts for about 37 percent of the total energy
intake of Americans, well above the upper limit of 30 percent
recommended by the American Heart Association and the American
Cancer Society,'' the report said.
   It said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with
heart attacks, can be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of
animal origin, such as eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry and
fish, and increasing consumption of plant-based foods, such as
vegetables and fruits.
   The report said Americans spend about $2.7 billion a year for
nutritional supplements ``of unproven benefit'' and warned against
fad diets or ``magical'' foods promoted with unsubstantiated claims.
   Over-the-counter vitamins and minerals, alone, represent a huge
business of questionable value, the report said.
   ``An estimated 40 percent of Americans consume supplemental
vitamins, minerals, or other dietary components at an annual cost
of more than $1.5 billion,'' even though such supplements are not
needed by most customers, the report said.
   Americans also spend extra money for products labeled as
``natural'' or ``organic'', even though the study said special
benefits of these products ``are not generally demonstrated.''
   ```Natural' vitamins, for example, often sell at twice the price
of synthetic products even though they are chemically identical,''
the report said. ``In some such products labeled as `natural', only
a minor fraction of the vitamin is actually derived from natural
sources.''

   ``History is alive to me,'' she said during a 1981 interview.
``I have tried to pass it on, and I've had a grand time doing it.''
   Her most ambitious work, which occupied most of her life, was to

<TEXT>
   A man sentenced to house arrest after
twice being caught dealing drugs from his home has been arrested
there again for selling cocaine, police say.
   Police detained George Tyson, 48, on drug charges Saturday night
_ less than three months after he began his prison sentence at his
home.
   ``I guess he duped me like everyone else,'' prosecutor Mark
Hanson, who had agreed to the sentence, said Tuesday. ``I'll tell
you one thing _ this time I'm going to flush him down the toilet.''
   When police brought Tyson to the stationhouse, he was still
wearing the house arrest program's electronic anklet _ a high-tech
``leash'' that broadcasts a signal to corrections officers to make
sure a prisoner does not stray from home.
   Tyson was wearing the device because he had been convicted in
May on two counts of dealing drugs from his home.
   Police said they found cocaine in neatly wrapped plastic
packages lying on Tyson's bedroom dresser during arrests in May and
August of 1987. Tyson was supposed to serve a year.
   ``Every time he was arrested, he was arrested at home,'' Delray
Beach police Lt. Richard Senff said. ``That's what struck me as
absolutely unbelievable'' about the house arrest sentence.
   Senff said he was particularly upset about Tyson's house arrest
because of the home's proximity to Carver Middle School, which is
about a block away.
   Tyson's latest arrest came after a confidential informant bought
crack cocaine from him at his home with a marked $20 bill, police
said. Officers, armed with a warrant, searched the house and found
24 cocaine rocks and $2,239 cash, including the marked bill, court
records showed.
   Hanson said that after his May conviction, Tyson had the choice
of being placed on house arrest for a year or going to prison for
three years.

   Muwanga, who served under former President Milton Obote in

was rearrested a few days later and charged with kidnapping two
truck drivers in 1981 with the intent of having them murdered.
   The two were among thousands of people killed during Obote's
campaign against the resistance led by Yoweri Museveni, who seized
power in 1986 after a five-year civil war.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filipino negotiators Wednesday blamed
Washington's inflexible position for the breakdown of talks on U.S.
military bases in the Philippines.
   ``We felt we were being cheated'' by the latest U.S. offer, said
negotiator Juanita Amatong.
   The Filipino team decided Tuesday to suspend the talks
indefinitely because of what spokesman Leonides Caday called
``substantial disagreement'' over payments for use of the six bases.
   The Philippine panel is insisting on a $1.2 billion annual
payment, according to an official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He said the Americans were offering roughly half that.
   The United States pays about $180 million a year for the use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller military
installations. Clark and Subic are the largest U.S. military
installations outside the United States.
   Amatong said members of her team also objected to a U.S. demand
that purchases of locally made products and salaries paid to the
nearly 70,000 Filipinos employed on the bases be included in the
total compensation figure.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus Wednesday blamed the collapse
on ``what appeared to be an inflexible American position.''
   ``I'm prepared to entertain any suggestions on the future of the
talks,'' Manglapus told reporters after meeting for about 40
minutes with President Corazon Aquino. ``But we have to be assured
that the position given to us by the Americans as inflexible is
indeed not inflexible.''
   ``Well, we tried,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters. ``We hoped that
we would finish. But after yesterday, I don't know.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Tuesday the U.S. government expects to resume negotiations and to
reach agreement.
   ``The talks have been temporarily broken off,'' said Redman.
``We do expect them to resume again ... I don't know exactly when.
There have been any number of breaks in these talks.''
   About 40,000 American military personnel, dependents and Defense
Department civilians are stationed in the Philippines.
   The United States is also the Philippine military's main arms
supplier in its 19-year old battle with communist rebels.
   Talks are held every five years to review the Military Bases
Agreement signed in 1947, the year after the Philippines became
independent of the United States, and is valid until 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino has agreed to honor the current agreement but
refuses to say whether she will support an extension beyond 1991,
one year before her term expires.
   Any extension of the agreement after 1991 must be in the form of
a treaty ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate,
where opposition to the bases is strong.
   U.S. officials say the bases are essential to protecting East
Asia from Soviet military expansion.

   Brigitte Horney, one of West
Germany's best-known television, stage and movie actresses, died
Wednesday at the age of 77.
   Horney, star of such German films as ``Savoy Hotel 217'' and
famous for her her sultry voice, died of heart failure, according
to the New German Film Company.
   Earlier this summer, she had portrayed a countess in the West
German TV series, ``The Guldenburgs' Heir.'' In 1980, she appeared
as Aunt Polly in a German version of Mark Twain's ``Tom Sawyer and
Huckeberry Finn.''
   The daughter of a doctor, Horney was born in Berlin on March 29,
1911. She landed her first film role at age 19 in the 1930 movie
``Abschied'' or ``Farewell.''
   Later, she appeared in plays at the City Theater in Wuerzburg
and the German Theater Berlin.
   She also appeared in the British films ``Secret Life'' and ``The
House of the Spaniard.''
   Horney moved to Switzerland just before the end of World War II.
After the war, she returned to West Germany and to the stage,
appearing in plays by Max Frisch, Jean-Paul Sartre and others.

   An associate professor of communications at
the University of Nebraska-Omaha said he has been denied an
opportunity to deliver speeches about American Indians because he
stutters.
   The Nebraska Committee for the Humanities ``said I have
something to say but that I couldn't say it,'' Bruce Johansen said
in a telephone interview with the Omaha World-Herald from Seattle
where he is spending the summer.
   Johansen said he had hoped to deliver speeches on ``American
Indian Contributions to Democracy.''
   The presentation would have been based on his book ``Forgotten
Founders'' and other speeches he has given around the country on
American Indians, Johansen said in the interview published in
Wednesday's editions of the newspaper.
   Johansen released a copy of a letter he received from Jennifer
Bauman, Humanities Resource Center coordinator.
   The letter said Johansen's bid was rejected, although his topic
was ``interesting and unique,'' because ``most people agreed that
your delivery would detract too much from groups' understanding of
your material.''
   The executive director of the Nebraska Committee for the
Humanities, Jane Renner Hood, said she could not discuss the
details of any speaker the organization turns down for funding.
   ``Our policy, and that of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, is not to discuss applications that are turned down,''
she said. ``If he (Johansen) is going to give details, fine. But I
can't.''
   Potential speakers must present their material to various groups
that might invite a speaker, Ms. Hood said. The audience generally
consists of such people as high school teachers and librarians, she
said.
   ``We try to certify as much as possible that we will have
excellent speakers,'' she said. ``We pull together an audience, and
evaluation forms are used.''
   About 45 people had expressed an interest in auditioning, and 30
went through the audition process, Ms. Hood said. Johansen and
three others were not included in the final list, she said.
   Johansen released copies of seven evaluations of his speech at
the audition. Five of the seven indicated that they believed his
speech problem would detract from the speech.
   The Nebraska Committee for the Humanities pays speakers an
honorarium of about $100 and expenses, Ms. Hood said. Private
foundations and the National Endowment for the Humanities fund the
committee.
   Johansen said he hasn't decided whether he will take action
against the committee. He said he never considered his stuttering
to be a problem. He teaches classes at UNO and delivers lectures
throughout the country.
   ``If, for example, everyone had their (the committee members')
attitude, I wouldn't be able to do anything,'' he said.
   Ms. Hood said she believes Johansen has the advantage in a
public discussion over his exclusion from the speakers' bureau.
   ``He can talk about it,'' she said. ``I can't. No matter how
tempting it is to explain our side, I simply can't do it.''
   Ms. Hood said, however, that the humanities committee does not
discriminate on the basis of handicaps, race, gender or religion.

   Nominees for the 40th annual Emmy
Awards will be announced Thursday with the Academy of Television
Arts & Sciences welcoming cable and pay television programs into
its competition.
   For the first time, network entries such as CBS' ``Frank's
Place,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and NBC's ``Cheers'' are facing
competition from such shows as Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's
Show'' and ``Brothers.''
   ``The cable industry is pleased with the number of entries this
first time,'' said Jim Boyle, a spokesman for the National Academy
of Cable Programming. ``Our hopes are very high for nominations and
winners. We think talent will be recognized.''
   More than 450 entries have been received from cable companies
eligible under new rules. They represent 10 percent of total
entries for the Emmy nominations.
   Any show can be entered in the competition, with nominees
selected from among the entries by a vote of all Academy members.
Panels of distinguished members in each category then pick the
winners.
   The Emmy Awards telecast will be presented live at 8 p.m. EDT
Sunday, Aug. 28, from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Lorne
Michaels, executive producer of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' will
produce the special 40th anniversary show on Fox Broadcasting Co.
   Presentation of the crafts awards will take place at a special
banquet Saturday, Aug. 27, at the Pasadena Exhibition Hall.
   There have been entries from shows that were on such cable and
pay systems as Arts & Entertainment, CBN, Disney Channel, Home Box
Office, Cinemax, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, Turner Broadcasting
System and USA Network.
   From cable, the Showtime miniseries ``Home Fires,'' a four-hour
examination of four days in the life of a family, and ``Codename:
Kyril,'' an espionage thriller starring Denholm Elliott, are
eligible for nominations against NBC's ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' and
``Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story,'' CBS' ``Echoes
in the Darkness'' and ABC's ``Bourne Identity.''
   HBO entries include: ``Dear America,'' a feature documentary on
the Vietnam War; ``Mandela,'' the story of South African rights
leader Nelson Mandela, starring Alfre Woodard and Danny Glover;
``Baja Oklahoma,'' a movie based on the book by Dan Jenkins; and
the musical special ``Roy Orbison and Friends: `A Black and White
Night.''
   Other Showtime shows up for possible nominations are ``Showtime
Coast to Coast,'' a musical show with Herbie Hancock as host;
``Gallagher Overboard,'' a variety special; and ``Shelley Duvall's
Tall Tales and Legends,'' a children's show.
   Entries from the Disney Channel include: ``The Brave Little
Toaster,'' an animated feature, ``Rick Nelson: A Brother
Remembers,'' and the live-action movie ``Save the Dog.''
   Here are other possible nominees from the networks:
   Drama series _ NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' ABC's ``China Beach'' and
``Thirtysomething'' and CBS' ``Cagney & Lacey'' and ``Beauty and
the Beast.''
   Comedy series _ ABC's ``Slap Maxwell,'' ``Hooperman,'' ``Growing
Pains,'' ``Who's the Boss,'' CBS' ``Frank's Place'' and ``Designing
Women,'' NBC's ``Cheers'' and ``Golden Girls.''
   Movies _ CBS' ``Foxfire'' and ``April Morning,'' NBC's ``The Ann
Jillian Story,'' ``Inherit the Wind'' and ``To Heal a Nation.''
   Miniseries _ ABC's ``Bourne Identity'' and ``Baby M,'' CBS'
``Echoes in the Darkness,'' NBC's ``The Murder of Mary Phagan.''
   Cable systems that operate in cities representing at least 51
percent of the nation's population are eligible under the new rules.
   There was some disagreement this year because the academy does
not require panelists to see all the shows nominated in the
category they are judging before they vote.
   ``We felt all nominations should be viewed by the judges, which
the academy does not do. But the academy has been very flexible and
we hope to work out our differences next year,'' said Boyle.
   The cable industry will continue to hold its own ACE awards,
since the Emmys represent only certain prime time programming. The
next ACE awards are scheduled for Jan. 15, 1989.
   The Governors Award this year will go to William Hanna and
Joseph Barbera, of Hanna-Barbera, for their many animated shows.
Their cartoon series range from ``The Jetsons'' to ``The
Flintstones'' to ``The Smurfs.''

<HEAD>No Documents, No Charges, Says Iran-Contra Judge</HEAD>

   A federal judge said Wednesday some of the
charges against former White House aide Oliver L. North likely will
be dismissed if prosecutors cannot make arrangements for release of
key secret documents in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said at a hearing on a motion
to postpone North's Sept. 20 trial that he can't make any decision
until ``we know what it is we're going to try.''
   Gesell indicated, however, he would not agree to a suggestion by
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh that some of the 16 charges be
set aside until the release of classified documents can be worked
out and that the trial go ahead on the other charges.
   ``It's now apparent that the government will not provide the
documents I've ordered be disclosed to the defense,'' Gesell said.
``Unless that isue can be reconciled by various stipulations or
agreements ... it's clear to me ... that the conspiracy counts will
have to be dismissed.''
   ``I've sent every signal I could that I have great doubts as to
whether these counts can be tried,'' Gesell said.
   The judge said he wanted documents that show what covert
operations were involved in the diversion of profits from the sale
of arms to Iran, who in high places knew about them and how North
was involved.
   Walsh said that in the next two days he would go back to
government intelligence officials and try to get documented answers
to the questions Gesell posed.
   The judge has already ordered that classified documents related
to the case be made available to the defense, but intelligence
agencies have refused to turn over some key papers, citing national
security interests.
   Walsh said he was ready to go ahead and try most of the counts
against North and request that charges of conspiracy, theft of
government property and wire raud be tried later.
   That would leave charges against North involving obstruction of
justice, personal enrichment and tax fraud.
   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and arms
dealers Richard Secord and Albert Hakim are due to have separate
trials on Iran-Contra charges. No dates have been set.
   North's lawyers want his trial postponed until next March. They
say Sept. 20 is too close to the presidential election and would
not allow them enough time to prepare a defense.
   Barry Simon, lawyer for North, told Wednesday's hearing the
trial would be affected by the presidential campaign. He noted
statements by speakers at last week's Democratic Convention in
Atlanta, including presidential candidate Michael Dukakis's pledge
not to issue pardons in the Iran-Contra affair if he is elected.
   The judge noted that North had been giving speeches around the
country and said, ``He certainly doesn't want to keep it out of
politics.''

   The crowd gave Yves Saint Laurent a standing
ovation for his colorful couture show on Wednesday, which featured
his flawless tailoring and technique, and his daring use of color.
   It's hard to imagine anybody else sustaining such interest
through a series of 25 tuxedo suits. Each one was perfection,
whether with short skirts, long skirts, long pants, spencers or
long jackets with white satin wing lapels or black kimono lapels.
   The sparkly vineyard embroideries with bunches of grapes
plastered onto bolero jackets and necklines of satin cocktail suits
and evening gowns nearly brought the house down.
   The show in the Intercontinental Hotel ballroom attracted
celebrity clients including first lady Danielle Mitterrand, Paloma
Picasso, film star Catherine Deneuve and American socialite Lynn
Wyatt.
   ``It was terrific, like watching an artist at work,'' said Liza
Minnelli. ``His clothes are works of art. It's like going to a
museum.''
   The suits were classics, wearable anywhere. Shoulders were amply
padded but not offensively so. Besides his favorite short and
straight skirt, Saint Laurent has adopted another shape and length:
a longer length to just below the knee, flared or pleated below the
hip.
   Daytime trousers looked straightforward and sporty, although
they could be dressed up by one of the mink or ruddy fox coats, or
a taffeta coat, another great Saint Laurent item for winter. With
raglan or puffed sleeves, these superb taffeta numbers sometimes
had bright, contrasting linings.
   Saint Laurent's use of zingy color was a far cry from his sober
looks of past seasons. Cerise and pink teamed often for day or
evening, and brightly piped suede suits came on in turquoise and
rust, red and green, rust and navy.
   It was a huge show _ 134 outfits _ and just about everything was
totally elegant and wearable, from the beautiful Chanel-style
dresses with touches of white and gold buttons to the marvelously
draped chiffons with a feminine high-waisted look to emphasize the
bust.
   Guy Laroche went colorful as well. The double-breasted cafe au
lait smooth wool suit was excellently tailored and shown with a
bright orange satin blouse. A violet leather fitted jacket with
brown mink shawl collar and cuffs over a lean tobacco short skirt
made a perfect dressy daytime outfit.
   Laroche used an original touch in some of the day and evening
wear: Chinese-lantern puffs on the sleeves. Some of the evening
wear was appealing, especially the beaded and embroidered black
dresses. But short evening gowns with puffy skirts and plenty of
fancy touches looked young and fussy.
   Lecoanet-Hemant, a youthful pair of designers celebrating their
10th haute couture season, showed they have all the technique it
takes to make couture. But it seems a shame to waste so much
fabulous fabric and detail on what sometimes ends up looking more
like abstract sculpture than clothes.
   Topped by spiraling hats, the dresses and suits with tiny
skirts, enormous stand-out basque bottoms on jackets, huge
cone-shaped tops sometimes looked overladen with details, and too
zany for comfort.
   Nevertheless, the miniskirts, draped and ``laced'' through
rhinestone loops, the exotic cut-out patterns and the superb satins
and rich Indian fabrics were well worth looking at, if hard to wear.
   Paco Rabanne also seems to concentrate more on showy art objects
than clothes, and aptly showed at the Decorative Arts wing of the
Louvre. He is famous for his chain-mail effects, and obliged an
audience eager to be entertained.
   Rabanne's sequined dresses, too, were larger than life, often
dazzling in all colors of the rainbow, reflected prism-like from
the sequins.
   Not everything was impractical. Rabanne also showed some very
attractive rubber raincoats and a good-looking reversible rubber
bolero lined with sequins worn with a black corduroy jumpsuit.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Strengthen Position During Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's military has been able to take
``irreversible advantage'' of the four-month-old cease-fire with
the Contra rebels, strengthening its overall position at a time of
a U.S. aid cutoff to the insurgents, a Contra leader said Wednesday.
   Enrique Bermudez, former Contra military commander and newly
elected member of the rebel political directorate, called for a
renewal of U.S. military aid as a signal of U.S. determination to
``establish democracy in Nicaragua.''
   Adolfo Calero, who joined Bermudez and three other members of
the directorate at a news conference, said the rebels have no
intention of violating the truce despite Bermudez's contention that
it has helped the Sandinistas.
   The rebel leaders spoke as Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., introduced
legislation to provide the rebels with $30 million in military aid
and $27.1 million in humanitarian assistance through March 1989.
   Senate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., also has introduced a
bill to aid the rebels, calling for a $47 million package that
includes $20 million in lethal assistance.
   In pleading for a resumption of aid, Bermudez asked, ``How can I
send the combatants to the field for a prolonged period of time
without any rounds of ammunition, surrounded by Sandinistas?''
   Since the cease-fire went into effect, he said, the Sandinistas
``have been reinforcing their military positions. They have been
rebuilding their military garrison. They have been relocating their
forces in key positions ... They have been receiving $40 million
monthly from the communist bloc.''
   Bermudez described these advantages as irreversible.
   The rebels, meanwhile, have received no military aid from the
United States since late February. Three weeks after the cutoff,
the Sandinistas and the Contras reached agreement on an interim
cease-fire but talks since then on arranging a final settlement
have broken down and no new negotiations are scheduled.
   Aid to the rebels since last April has been limited to
humanitarian items, including cash deliveries for food purchases.
   Calero said the rebels want to return to the bargaining table
but that the Sandinistas must first make good-faith gestures
signaling a willingness to establish democracy.
   The last round of talks was held in June and ended in failure,
with each side holding the other responsible for the outcome.
   Last week, Bermudez resigned as commander of rebel forces along
the northern front after his election as a member of the
directorate. His new role calls for coordinating decisions of the
directorate related to military activities.
   He will be responsible for strategic planning and supervising
the carrying out of military operations but will no longer be
involved in day-to-day activities and will not have troops under
his command.
   His election to the directorate has caused controversy because
he is the first military man to be chosen for that role. One reason
he had been denied a political voice until now was his prior career
as an officer in the National Guard under the Somoza family dynasty.

<HEAD>FAA Can't Keep Up With Dollar-Driven Airlines, Congress Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
``scrambling vainly to catch up'' with a rapidly changing airline
industry whose decisions at times are driven by dollars and not
safety, a congressional study said Wednesday.
   The 183-page report by the Office of Technology Assessment
suggests that Congress provide the FAA with additional funds and
press for more inspectors and air traffic controllers as well as
organizational streamlining that places more emphasis on safety.
   Unannounced inspections and periodic in-depth inspections of
both large and small airlines by the FAA ``are indispensable tools
for ensuring public safety'' but currently the FAA doesn't have
enough inspectors, said the report.
   The OTA is a nonpartisan agency that helps Congress deal with
complex and often highly technical issues. The report on air safety
was requested by the House aviation subcommittee.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, said
the report's call for ``stable and adequate funding'' for the FAA
is among its most important findings.
   ``For the balance of this century, the FAA's funding needs will
continue to increase if we expect to maintain the high level of
safety which the public demands of aviation,'' said Mineta at a
news conference. But he acknowledged those funds may be hard to
find ``under the enormous deficits that have piled up in recent
years.''
   The study notes that the safety record of U.S. airlines ``ranks
among the best in the world'' but it added that the intense changes
in the industry and bitter competition among airlines poses safety
concerns.
   ``While airline officials are concerned about safety, financial
considerations drive many industry decisions and will continue to
do so as long as strong competition exists among the airlines,''
the study concludes.
   At the same time, it said, the FAA has been ``hit hard by budget
cuts and personnel reductions (and) has fallen behind in both
numbers of staff and levels of technical expertise.''
   It said that while human errors account for a large majority of
airline accidents, ``FAA programs to understand human error and
enhance controller, mechanic and cockpit crew performance are
inadequate.''
   At the same time the growth in air traffic resulting in
increasingly crowded skies at major airports ``could outstrip the
capabilities of the (FAA) traffic system'' if it is not modernized.
The FAA is in the midst of updating its air traffic control
equipment, but that is not expected to be completed until the late
1990s.
   The FAA's shortcomings are particularly worrisome at a time when
closer monitoring of the aviation industry is required, the report
suggested.
   Competitive pressures have placed increased emphasis on keeping
down costs at all airlines, resulting in the elimination of ``some
of the layers of the old safety system,'' the report said.
   Some airlines have ``pared back'' their safety departments, many
have lowered hiring standards, increased pilot and mechanical duty
time, reorganized or cut wages, the study said.
   While the ``cumulative impacts on safety of these decisions are
difficult to quantify'' there is evidence that airline executives
are under intense pressure to focus on meeting only the minimum
safety standards required by the FAA and not go beyond those
requirements, the report suggested
   ``While `safety comes first' is the instant response of airline
executives when asked the basis for management decisions, this
universal answer masks wide variances in airline corporate cultures
and operating procedures,'' the report continued.
   ``Safety first means one set of corporate guidelines (to an
economically strong air carrier). ... It means something else
entirely to a financially strapped airline that must choose between
discretionary maintenance of its aircraft and purchase of
additional airport (landing) slots because it cannot afford both.''

<HEAD>U.S. Sees No Peace Feeler in Iranian Bid for Assets</HEAD>

   An offer by a senior Iranian official to help
free American hostages in Lebanon was dismissed Wednesday by the
Reagan administration as dated and not an indication Tehran wants
to open talks with the United States.
   The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said freeing
the nine hostages was ``a humanitarian issue'' and not subject to
bartering with Iran concerning Iranian assets frozen in the United
States.
   Iran has petitioned a tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, to
recover the assets, which have an estimated worth of $1 billion.
   Redman said the Iranian offer has ``resurfaced many times over
the past two years, and each time we have noted that there can be
no connection between the hostages and Iran's claim in The Hague.''
   Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's
parliament and acting commander in chief of its armed forces, said
Tuesday he would help obtain the release of the American captives
if the United States returned frozen assets.
   ``No deals,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
promptly retorted.
   Iranian assets, including military equipment and some funds in
American bank accounts, were seized by President Carter in 1979
after Iranians sacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its
American occupants hostage.
   Many of the assets were released in January 1981, as Iran freed
the Americans after a 444-day ordeal. A special tribunal in The
Hague, which arbitrated claims by the two governments, has
jurisdiction over the assets that remain forzen, Redman said.
   In the last few weeks, as part of an effort to persuade Iran to
end the war in the Persian Gulf with Iraq, the Reagan
administration has sent indirect messages to Tehran proposing talks
after an eight-year break in relations.
   President Reagan publicly has suggested a dialogue with Tehran.
   Apart from the 7{-year war, U.S. officials said other issues
they wanted to discuss were the hostages and terrorism.
   Mindful, however, of the Iran-Contra arms and money fiasco, the
officials have insisted they would deal only with ``authorized''
Iranians. After secretly shipping missiles to Iran in 1985 and 1986
in an effort to promote ``moderation'' and to free the hostages,
the administration discovered it was dealing with Iranians who
could not _ or did not want to _ alter Iranian policy.
   Redman suggested there would be no formal reply to Rafsanjani's
proposal, apart from the public dismissal of the offer.
   ``I don't know that there's any reason to reply any more
directly than we have already this time, publicly,'' he said.
``We've replied to similar remarks by Rafsanjani, by Prime Minister
(Hosein) Musavi (Khamenei) in the past.''
   The U.S. official added: ``Our position concerning hostages is,
as always, that that is not something that one can negotiate about,
that you can't make deals.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy told a House
subcommittee on Wednesday, ``We will not accept any linkage between
the fate of our hostages and outstanding claims. ... Iran has the
prime responsibility to get them released.''
   Redman said the latest proposal did not seem connected to
current efforts at the United Nations to impose a cease-fire in the
gulf war. Nor, he said, was Rafsanjani's proposal taken here as an
official response to U.S. overtures for talks.
   ``I don't see any indication that it's that kind of a
response,'' the U.S. official said.

   Newspaper editor Michael G. Gartner will
replace Lawrence K. Grossman as president of NBC's news division,
network sources said today. Grossman said he is leaving because of
differences in ``style, personality and priorities.''
   Grossman, confirming a report in today's New York Times, said
his departure after four years, during which he helped lift the
network in the ratings, was ``a mutual decision by myself and (NBC
President) Bob Wright.''
   Grossman was in Los Angeles with other NBC executives for a
network meeting.
   The appointment of Gartner, former editor of The Courier-Journal
of Louisville, Ky., and the The Des Moines (Iowa) Register, was to
be announced later today, said the NBC sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Gartner is a part-time general news executive with Gannett Co.
and editor of the Ames, Iowa, Daily Tribune.
   Grossman said in an interview that ``it's time for them to get
their own guy in there,'' referring to General Electric Co., which
acquired NBC two years ago.
   ``It's been in the works for a while,'' Grossman said. ``Things
have changed. It hasn't been all that fun lately. I've been there
four years. It's a difference in style, personality and priorities.
   ``I'm very proud of what we've accomplished _ onward and
upward.''
   Grossman, former president of the Public Broadcasting Service,
was hired by then-NBC chairman Grant Tinker in 1984. Under
Grossman's tenure, NBC News improved its standing in news
broadcasts, with the ``Today'' show moving into first place and
``NBC Nightly News'' gaining status.
   But several attempts to start a prime-time news program failed
and the ``Nightly News'' slipped from the top ratings at a time
when the network's prime-time programming was particularly
successful.
   Grossman said the change was effective immediately, though he
would stay to help aid the transition.
   Grossman wouldn't say what he was going to do after leaving NBC.
   Network executives whom the Times did not identify said
Grossman's problems were related more to inside politics than to
the ratings decline.
   Among key NBC people considered strong critics of Grossman are
anchorman Tom Brokaw and Steve Friedman, former executive producer
of the ``Today'' show who left NBC more than a year ago and is now
producing ``USA Today: The Television Show'' for GTG Entertainment.
   According to the Times, Brokaw's criticism centered on
Grossman's lack of a journalism background.

<HEAD>Lawmakers See No Consumer Benefit in Plan To Lift Profit Cap on
AT&T</HEAD>

   Members of the House telecommunications
subcommittee said Wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers
will benefit from a Federal Communications Commission proposal to
change the way telephone companies are regulated.
   Panel members said they were open-minded about the FCC's
proposal to lift limits on the profits of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. and the local Bell telephone companies and instead
set a ceiling on prices. But they said they have yet to see
evidence that the change would benefit ratepayers.
   ``The only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has
raised more questions than it answers,'' said Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., subcommittee chairman.
   AT&T and the Bell companies have been lobbying hard for a change
from profit regulation to price caps, but others in the
telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these
large companies too much advantage over competitors.
   The FCC could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect
next year unless Congress acts to block the plan or pressurs the
FCC to drop it.
   At the panel's hearing, Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T vice president
of marketing services, supported the plan as it applied to his
company.
   Limits on prices rather than profits would ``in all probability
result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases'' by
creating incentives for cost-savings by allowing the company to be
more competitive and innovative, Garfinkel said.
   But as applied to the Bell companies, the proposal fails to
assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will
drop with declining costs, he said.
   AT&T is the nation's largest long-distance company, serving
about 70 percent of the market The rates for AT&T, the only
long-distance company whose interstate business is federally
regulated, set the pace for the rest of the industry.
   MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance company, also
opposes price caps for the Bell companies because of the local
companies' control of access to the local phone network.
   Local access charges already are excessive, and higher charges
would simply raise long-distance rates for consumers, said Gerald
J. Kovach, MCI senior vice president.
   Philip Campbell, chief financial officer of Bell Atlantic, said
the Bell companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same
encouragement for cost-savings, efficiencies and innovation under
the price caps proposal.
   At a minimum, local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than
inflation, he said.
   But Dennis Dundon, chairman of the Competitive
Telecommunications Association, which represents more than 100
long-distance companies, said lifting profit regulation on AT&T and
the Bell companies would be a mistake.
   ``Deregulating monopolies is just not good policy,'' Dundon said.
   Without adequate controls, AT&T would be able to undercut
competition by charging below cost for some services and making up
the difference with higher prices on essential services, he said.
The Bell companies, given more flexibility, could tailor service
arrangements for the large long-distance companies at the expense
of the smaller companies.
   ``The price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive
environment, where market forces would exercise a check on
excessive or predatory prices,'' he said.

<HEAD>Military Court Sentences Yugoslav Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court Wednesday
convicted three Slovenian journalists of disclosing military
secrets and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five to 18
months, a supporter of the accused said.
   More than 10,000 Yugoslavs awaiting the verdict outside the
courthouse roared with disapproval when they heard the news, and
some chanted anti-government slogans.
   An army sergeant-major who allegedly leaked a classified
document to the journalists was given four years in jail by the
military court in Ljubljana, capital of Yugoslavia's most liberal
republic, Slovenia, said Donci Kuzmanic, a spokesman for The
Committee in the Defense of the Accused, an unofficial group
supporting the defendants.
   Journalists Janez Jansa, David Tasic and Franci Zavrl, along
with Ivan Borstner, the non-commissioned army officer, were
sentenced for revealing a document dealing with the deployment and
combat readiness of army units in this northern republic.
   Jansa, a columnist for the outspoken youth magazine Mladina, and
Zavrl, its chief editor, received 18 months each, Kuzmanic told The
Associated Press. He said Tasic, a journalist working for Mladina,
was sentenced to five months.
   The official Tanjug news agency also reported the sentences.
   According to the verdict, read to reporters by chief judge Col.
Djuro Vlaisavljevic, Borstner had removed the ``top secret'' stamp
from the military document before giving a copy of it to the
journalists.
   Jansa planned to use the information for his articles,
Vlaisavljevic said. The closed-door trial, which started July 11,
caused an uproar in Slovenia, which has emerged as the vanguard of
political reforms in communist Yugoslavia.
   The court released Borstner, Tasic and Jansa from custody
pending an appeal to the supreme military tribunal in Belgrade,
Tanjug reported.
   ``The verdict is completly unfounded and represents a travesty
of justice,'' Zavrl told his supporters. Zavrl, the only defendant
not held in custody, regularly commented on the trial, saying it
was ``a shameful, humiliating court proceeding.''
   The defendants alleged the trial was rigged and that the
verdicts were decided before the proceedings began.
   As the journalists emerged from the courthouse, the crowd
cheered and carried them away on their shoulders, a witness said.
   ``We will struggle till the end to defend our freedom,'' Jansa
said. ``I will not speak much, because in this country every word
could be used against you.''
   The journalists have written articles sharply criticizing the
Yugoslav army and its leaders and alleging they were plotting a
crackdown in Slovenia.
   Tanjug quoted a court statement saying that Bortner's motive in
leaking the document was that ``he saw the document as a danger to
his Slovenian people.''
   ``By giving the document to Mladina, he hoped that its contents
would be disclosed to the Slovenian leadership,'' Tanjug reported.
   Military trials of civilians are highly unusual in Yugoslavia,
where the armed forces, unlike the police and civilian courts, are
under federal control.
   Thousands of people attended protest meetings and signed
petitions against the trial, widely seen in the republic an army
move to intimidate dissidents, some of whom have demanded that the
government resign for mismanaging the economy.
   The liberal Slovenian leadership demanded that the trial be
conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers,
and that they all be released from custody.
   The army rejected all of the requests, citing what they said was
the sensitive nature of the classified documents and arguing that
Serbo-Croatian is the official language of the armed forces.

<HEAD>Economy Shows Strong Growth, But Spurt In Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent
annual pace from April through June, but rising food, energy and
clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent, its
highest level in almost six years, the government reported
Wednesday.
   Some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation
was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic
recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year.
The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary
deviation.
   The Commerce Department reported that the growth rate in the
gross national product, the economy's total output of goods and
services, was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent
increase in the first three months of the year.
   But inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,
registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982. The
GNP price index had risen at 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
   The Reagan administration, which is counting on a strong economy
this year to keep the White House in Republican hands, hailed the
strong growth numbers and dismissed the higher inflation rate as an
aberration.
   ``Prices have temporarily picked up but they are not a harbinger
of more general inflation,'' said Beryl Sprinkel, the president's
chief economist. ``The price increases are reflecting the drought
and higher import prices because of the fall in the dollar.''
   Others were more concerned.
   ``We have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a
by-product of our long expansion,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co. ``The demand side of our economy is now
exceeding our ability to produce, which is causing price
pressures.''
   The Federal Reserve has already pushed interest rates higher as
a way of dampening demand and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the central bank stood ready to tighten further if
inflationary pressures did not abate.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
agreed with the administration's assessment that the spike in
inflation in the second quarter was likely to moderate in coming
quarters. He said it was produced primarily by higher clothing and
energy costs, which have already declined since spring. He
predicted that food costs would moderate as well, especially if
more rain falls in the parched Midwest.
   All economists agreed that overall growth during the second
quarter showed the hoped-for movement away from a consumer-led
expansion to export-led growth. In fact, 62 percent of the increase
in GNP in the spring came from an $18.9 billion narrowing of the
country's trade deficit, the biggest improvement since early 1980.
   ``We are very lucky to get a growth picture that is this
well-balanced at this stage of the business cycle,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   In addition to the strength in exports, the economy was
propelled in the spring by a 14 percent increase in business
investment as U.S. manufacturers rushed to expand production
facilities to keep up with growing export demands.
   Growth would have been even stronger in the second quarter but
the drought reduced farm production by an estimated $5.5 billion at
an annual rate, which shaved one-half percentage point from the GNP
increase, according to Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner.
   This was more than offset by an increase in auto production,
which added 1.3 percentage points to GNP growth in the second
quarter, Ortner said.
   The GNP report Wednesday was accompanied by benchmark revisions
to GNP data going back the past three years. Those revisions
generally showed stronger growth than originally believed, in part
because of higher consumer spending.
   The revisions showed the economy grew 3.4 percent in 1987, up
from a previous estimate of 2.9 percent GNP growth last year.
   The Reagan administration has revised its estimate for growth
this year to 3 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter of
1987, up from an administration forecast of 2.4 percent at the
beginning of the year.
   In the first six months, the economy grew at a 3.25 percent rate
and many forecasters said they expected growth to be around 3
percent for the remainder of the year. This growth performance
would be a far cry from the recession many analysts were once
predicting in the wake of the record October stock-market plunge.
   Instead, the economy has performed strongly this year, helping
to push the unemployment rate down to a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent
in June.
   Overall, GNP grew at an annual rate of $30.2 billion in the
spring quarter, pushing total inflation-adjusted GNP to $3.986
trillion in the second quarter.
   Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second
quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent.
   Even housing construction showed some strength in the second
quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent
drop in the first quarter. But analysts said rising mortgage rates
would depress housing further in coming months.

<HEAD>Navy Declares War On Doves At Air Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mother Nature's birds are interfering
with the U.S. Navy's birds and now the war is on.
   Flocks of mourning doves feeding along Jacksonville Naval Air
Station's new runway are threatening the Navy's P-3 Orion
antisubmarine aircraft. Some have been sucked into the engines, and
officials fear it might cause a crash.
   One of the aircraft had to abort a takeoff last week when two of
its engines were damaged by birds. The doves also have caused a
reduction in the number of flights from the base alongside the St.
Johns River.
   For the rest of this week, a team of volunteers, including
dentists, firefighters and security officers, will take up
positions along the runway armed with a variety of noise-making
explosives.
   They hope to scare off most of the birds. They'll kill those
they don't.
   ``You just can't use pyrotechnics alone,'' said Navy spokesman
Nick Young. ``The birds get wise and figure out it's just a bunch
of noise that's not hurting anybody.''
   The Navy has received permission from state and federal
officials to kill the mourning doves, known for their plaintive
cries, if they can't be driven away.
   Cindy Mosling, founder of the Bird Emergency and Kare Sanctuary,
or BEAKS, who is known as Jacksonville's ``Bird Lady,'' said there
are other ways of scaring off the doves without killing them.
   ``In New Zealand and other places, they put hawks on tether
lines,'' she said, offering to take some of the predators to
Jacksonville NAS.
   But Young said the Navy would need a lot of tethered hawks to
clear the runway quickly. The alternative, he said, would be to
suspend air operations until the doves are scared away.
   The volunteers will be along the runway during daylight hours
through Friday in hopes of solving the problem, said M.J. Meyer,
airfield manager.
   The best times to scare away the doves are early in the morning
and at dusk, when they feed, he said.
   The bird problem began Friday when the new runway opened, Young
said. That day, the tall grass alongside the runway was mowed and
grass seeds dropped to the ground.
   ``The doves move from field to field, when there's food
available. The word gets out among birds, like people, that there's
a free meal,'' said Young.
   Navy officials are hopeful that adding grass catchers to mowers
will prevent the problem in the future. The grass catchers would
pick up the grass seeds that attracted them to the runway in the
beginning, Young said.

<HEAD>U.S. Suspends Talks With Qatar Over Unauthorized Stinger Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has suspended military and
economic talks with Qatar to protest the Persian Gulf sheikdom's
unauthorized acquisition of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, U.S.
diplomats said Wednesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said the suspension
would remain in place until Qatar returns the missiles to the
United States.
   ``What we have done is to place on hold a number of agreements
that were under consideration,'' Murphy told the House subcommittee
on Europe and the Middle East.
   ``We consider it very much in the interests of developing the
solid relationship with Qatar that those missiles be returned
soonest. And we've made that very clear,'' he added.
   Murphy himself made an official protest when he visited the
Qatari capital of Doha last month.
   Another official, speaking on condition he not be named, said
Qatar had been seeking several military and economic agreements
with the United States, including the purchase of weapons. ``We
told them everything is frozen,'' he added. ``Relations are now
correct but cool.''
   The United States does not have any defense cooperation with
Qatar but considers the country important as a member of the
pro-Western Gulf Cooperation Council which includes Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
   U.S. officials wants to get the Stingers back in order to see
their serial numbers and determine where Qatar got them. The United
States first learned of the Stingers' presence in Qatar last March,
when an embassy official saw one of the rockets in television
footage of a military parade.
   U.S. officials say they do not know how many of the
shoulder-fired rockets Qatar has. They have speculated that Qatar
was given the Stingers by Iran, which in turn captured them from
the U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels fighting against the Soviet
occupation of their country.
   Other officials say Qatar may have bought the missiles on the
black market, although that possibility is less likely.
   Strict controls apply to the sale of the Stingers, which are
considered of great value to terrorists because they are portable
and highly accurate.
   In response to questioning, Murphy said the United States was
not considering recalling its ambassador to Qatar who heads a tiny
mission of five Americans.
   Such a move would not be in the interests of maintaining
relations with the pro-Western oil state, Murphy said. The
ambassador ``is the only one with access to decision makers''
there, he added.
   Qatar contends it needs the missiles for self-defense and has
rejected any attempts by U.S. officials to even see them.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro is asking Cubans
for more hard work and fewer illusions as he looks ahead to the
30th anniversary of the day he took power.
   Castro approaches the Jan. 1 anniversary with about 60 percent
of the island's 11 million people too young to remember the fervor
of his fight. But he praised the new generation for its
revolutionary enthusiasm.
   In his three-hour, nationally televised speech Tuesday night,
Castro predicted hard times ahead and urged Cubans to work hard and
stop dreaming of such luxuries as an eight-hour work day.
   The good news in the speech marking the July 26 start of his
five-year battle was that Cuban troops may come home from their
13-year involvement in Angola.
   ``We will happily receive our combatants,'' Castro said, and
welcome them back to ``the battle for development of our country.''
   Castro said troops would stay there ``until the minute'' that an
agreement is signed in the U.S.-mediated talks between South Africa
and Cuba. He gave no time frame but said the pullout will not be
sudden.
   Castro has never spoken so explicitly about bring Cuban troops
home.
   He frequently mentioned the Jan. 1 celebration of the day he
marched into Havana 30 years ago to take power from dictator
Fulgencio Batista.
   He spoke at length about his communist government's progress,
citing economic gains, public works and the revolution's vaunted
public health system.
   Before 1959, he said, there were 180 doctors in Santiago, the
nation's largest city after Havana. Now, he said, there are 2,470.
   Even more important, he said, is the fact that ``these new
generations of Santiagans are even more enthusiastic and more
revolutionary than the generations that preceded them.''
   The degree of that enthusiasm could be crucial in the coming
years of hardship Castro predicts because of bleak prospects for
improvement in the foreign exchange situation.
   Just two years ago, at the third Communist Party Congress,
Castro said laziness, absenteeism and inefficiency had become such
a problem that Cuba might become a nation of freeloaders.
   On Tuesday, he said things have improved and the ``first
fruits'' of his rectification campaign are being seen.
   But he also called for more hard work and fewer illusions and
told those yearning for an industrialized nation, where the work
day is eight hours or less, that they are dreaming.
   ``It's necessary to work and work hard,'' he said.``We don't
impose anything on the worker. We persuade the worker.''
   The rectification campaign has moved away from economic
incentives toward the kind of moral exhortation employed in the
early days of the revolution.
   Castro also made it clear that he isn't going to launch any
reform campaigns like those of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Cuba will never adopt methods, styles, philosophies or
idiosyncracies of capitalism,'' he said. Capitalist systems, Castro
said, are ``complete garbage. They're not good for anything.''
   He also said there will be no move away from one-party rule.
   Castro wore his standard green uniform and cap. Although his
famous beard is turning white, he spoke with as much vigor and
animation as ever. But his image was still a sharp contrast to the
pictures of the young revolutionary and his comrades preparing for
the July 26, 1958, attack on the Moncada garrison.
   The attack failed. But five years and five months later, Castro
marched triumphantly into Havana.

<TEXT>
   A long-time political activist said
Wednesday he has been the target of three break-ins in as many
weeks and believes they were politically motivated.
   Chris Wood, who has been active in the Vermont Rainbow
Coalition, the Vermont Committee on Southern Africa and the Vermont
Central America Non-Intervention Network, said the break-ins
occurred this month at his home, former office and current office.
   He and a spokeswoman for a New York group that defends the civil
rights of activists said the break-ins fit the pattern of more than
100 similar burglaries at homes and offices of activists and
journalists around the country and abroad.
   In all three break-ins, Wood said, a crowbar or other flat
instrument was used to pry open a door, ``papers were shuffled
around'' and nothing of value was stolen.
   Wood said he suspected the FBI was involved, but Ray McElhaney,
an FBI spokesman in Washington, said, ``I don't think there have
been any break-ins involving the FBI. ... I have no statement
regarding the allegations of this person in Montpelier, Vermont.''
   ``We're now monitoring more than 120 break-ins around the
country of this type,'' said Alicia Fernandez of the Movement
Support Network, which is affiliated with the Center for
Constitutional Rights.
   She said that the motives for the break-ins _ in which nothing
was stolen but files were rifled _ appeared to intelligence
gathering, harassment and intimidation.
   McElhaney said the FBI had launched its own investigation into
allegations of politically motivated break-ins but determined that
jurisdiction for the burglaries rested with state and local police.
   Montpelier police officer Kenneth Roberts said he, too,
initially thought the break-ins were politically motivated, but
that other recent break-ins with similar modes of operation had
since led him to believe otherwise. He said it was unusual for
break-ins to occur without anything being stolen, but that it had
happened on at least two other instances in the city recently.
   Wood's allegation came the same day The Boston Globe reported
that confidential CBS News memos stolen from the home of a reporter
based in Costa Rica had turned up in files released by the FBI in
response to a subpoena.
   Free-lance reporter Tony Avirgan told the lobe that his home was
broken into in 1985 and about a year later, during a time when he
was investigating on assignment from CBS an assassination attempt
against a dissident Contra leader. Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif,
chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the FBI,
said the documents indicate that the FBI ``could have been getting
the fruits of political burglaries and break-ins.''
   A spokesman for the FBI said the bureau had no comment on how
the reporter's documents ended up in its possession.

<TEXT>
   Still nursing scars from the Iran-Contra
affair, Reagan administration officials are publicly imposing
ground rules which seemingly limit flexibility to win the
liberation of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Officials at the White House and State Department say no deals
will be negotiated with Iran and that the U.S. government will
discuss the hostage situation only with ``authoritative''
representatives of the Tehran government.
   Neither of these limitations was placed on the jockeying in
1985-86 that led to the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran, the
diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels and the subsequent
indictment of two onetime White House officials.
   However, two American hostages _ David Jacobsen and the Rev.
Benjamin Weir _ were released during that mercurial period.
   President Reagan subsequently argued that he was merely seeking
an opening to Iran, not an arms-for-hostages trade, when he
approved the transfer of TOW anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles
to Tehran.
   A presidential panel disagreed with him, and so did a joint
congressional investigative committee.
   Reagan eventually acknowledged that what had started out as an
overture to moderate political elements in Iran had turned into
what the public perceived as an arms-for-hostages swap.
   Iran's acceptance last week of a U.N. resolution imposing a
cease-fire in the long war with Iraq has raised expectations of an
improved climate for getting the hostages out of Lebanon.
   When asked Monday if the time was ripe to try once again to talk
to the Iranians about the hostages, Reagan said of the Iranian
officials: ``If they're ready and willing to talk, it's time.''
   But administration officials followed that broad-brush remark
with a series of statements stressing limitations on U.S.
willingness to deal with Iran on this subject. They said the
administration would not again fall prey to something that can be
construed as bargaining with a terrorist nation for the release of
hostages.
   So, the guidance that administration officials gave out for
public consumption was that they would not go to any length to get
the hostages out.
   But the administration previously had denied certain aspects of
the 1985-86 initiative, and was proved wrong.
   Reagan, for instance, sent an amended statement to the Tower
review board about how the initial missile shipments had been
approved by him.
   While steadfastly insisting that officials are doing all they
can to learn the whereabouts of the nine Americans and get them
out, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought Wednesday to
minimize the significance of statements from Iran suggesting a new
interest in the issue.
   In so doing, he set forth another ground rule limiting U.S.
diplomatic flexibility: an insistence that the U.S. government have
direct communication from Tehran or an authoritative source
speaking for the government of revolutionary leader, the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   If Iran wants to talk to the United States, the spokesman said,
its leaders must back up statements in speeches with
``authoritative communications'' to the United States.
   Fitzwater left no doubt that the uproar over earlier U.S.
dealings on hostages has made U.S. officials more wary _ and even
cautious _ than before.
   ``One of the lessons we learned from that experience
(Iran-Contra) is that it's very difficult to have those kinds of
discussions without them becoming arms for hostages or ransom for
hostages or negotiations for hostages,'' the spokesman said.
   ``And that's why we're not going to do it again.''
   As if to prove his point, Fitzwater scoffed at statements by
Iran's Parliament speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani,
indicating an interest in warming relations with Washington and
suggesting a willingness to deal on the hostages.
   ``We frankly don't know what they're trying to say,'' Fitzwater
said. ``It their pattern to make these kinds of claims and hope
somebody bites, and you will recall we went through this a year
ago.''
   ``My scars are deep enough, I do not forget those
conversations,'' said Fitzwater, who bore the brunt of reporters'
questions after the Iran-Contra affair was exposed in November 1986.
   The release of 52 American hostages from Iran in early 1981 was
brought about, at least in part, by a U.S. deal to turn over to an
international tribunal at least $3 billion in frozen Iranian assets.
   Reagan signed an executive order seeking to enforce the assets
agreement that then-President Jimmy Carter made with Iran, although
officials of the new administration said they would not have signed
such an agreement.
   Asked Wednesday if the administration was ruling out just such
an arrangement, Fitzwater said, ``We don't link assets to hostages,
and no deals.''
   The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said freeing
the nine hostages was not subject to bartering with Iran over
frozen assets.
   ``This is a proposal that has been surfaced and resurfaced many
times over the past two years, and each time we have noted that
there can be no connection between the hostages and Iran's claim in
(International Claims Tribunal) The Hague,'' Redman said.
   Fitzwater bristled when asked whether the hostages had become
``the forgotten men.''
   ``No, we've been talking about them every day for a week,'' he
said, referring to his give-and-take with reporters during White
House news briefings.

<HEAD>Fourteen More Deaths From Disease in Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An epidemic of cholera and
gastroenteritis killed 14 more people in the capital on Wednesday
and raised the nationwide death toll to 445, hospital officials and
news reports said.
   An opposition leader called for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to
resign and said he ``had failed to provide an effective
administration in New Delhi.'' L.K. Advani, president of the
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, was addressing a protest march
by relatives of disease victims in the capital.
   Since the beginning of the month, 171 people have died in New
Delhi alone from the diseases, news reports said.
   A health official in New Delhi said 14 people died in hospitals
on Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more
than 12,800 cases of the two diseases had been reported in the
nation. The outbreak followed heavy rains in the past month that
reportedly contaminated drinking water.
   In New Delhi, city officials blame the outbreak of the diseases
on the contamination of wells by overflowing sewers. They also
blame the contamination on rainfall washing through uncollected
garbage.
   Garbage in several slums on the eastern edge of the city was not
collected for more than three months because of a disagreement
between two city agencies.
   In Parliament, Home Minister Buta Singh said the government
would take action against those found responsible for the epidemic.
   In addition to causing disease, the rains from the annual
monsoons have resulted in more than 300 deaths from drowning,
mudslides or collapses of huts.
   Thirty-one more deaths were reported Wednesday, including 19
killed in the past several days in flash floods near Jammu, in
Kashmir state, the United News of India reported.
   Other victims included three children crushed to death when a
wall of their house collapsed in Uttar Pradesh state; seven people
reported drowned in Gujarat state; and two swept away in the Ravi
River in Punjab state, news agencies said.

   Police said Wednesday they arrested
an American wanted in the United States in connection with an
Asia-based drug ring that authorities have called the biggest ever
uncovered.
   The 42-year-old man was arrested Monday in Zurich, a police
statement said.
   Zurich police refused to release the American's name. He was
being held pending extradition to the United States, the statement
said.
   Since Monday, 23 people have been arrested in Europe and the
United States in connection with the ring, allegedly led by Briton
Dennis Howard Marks, 43. Marks claimed in the past to be an agent
for MI6, the British counterintelligence agency.
   It said the arrest resulted from a long-term investigation by
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in cooperation with police
in Hong Kong, Thailand, Spain and Zurich.
   Marks, his wife, Judith Marks, and fellow Briton Geoffrey Kenion
were arrested Monday in Spain on an indictment that accuses all the
defendants of racketeering, interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen
said Tuesday in Miami.
   Lehtinen said that for 17 years, the group shipped marijuana
from Thailand and hashish from Pakistan. It allegedly operated in
England, West Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States and other nations.
   The traffickers allegedly laundered money through banks and
corporations around the world.
   ``It's the largest enterprise ever uncovered involving Asia,''
William Norris, chief of the organized crime division of the U.S.
attorney's office, said Tuesday.

   Fazlur Rahman, a professor at the University of
Chicago and one of the nation's leading experts on the Moslem
faith, has died of complications related to heart surgery. He was
68.
   Rahman, who lived in Naperville, had been the Harold K. Swift
Distinguished Service Professor in the school's Near Eastern
Languages and Civilizations department since 1969.
   Rahman, who died Tuesday, was world-renowned for his modern
interpretation of Moslem law. He proposed that the Koran gave broad
moral prescriptions that should be adapted as social conditions
change rather than used as the basis for a rigid and unchanging
system. Those views were called radical by Islamic fundamentalists
who believe in a strict interpretation of the Koran.
   He left his homeland of what is now West Pakistan in the late
1940s, and found great success in spreading his philosophy at
several universities.
   The U.S. State Department sought him as an advisor in dealing
with Arab nations, and journalists called upon him for information
and interpretation.
   He was the author of ``Islam,'' ``Philosophy of Mulla Sadra,''
and ``Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual
Tradition.'' He also wrote ``Avicenna's Psychology,'' which
described the influence the 11th Century Arab thinker had had on
theologian St. Thomas Aquinas and other Western thinkers.
   Survivors include his wife, Bilquees; a daughter, five sons and
a grandson.

<HEAD>Rescuers Raise Fishing Boat, Recover 20 Bodies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers Wednesday recovered 20 bodies when
they raised the wreckage of a fishing boat that sank after
colliding with a navy submarine last week at the entrance to Tokyo
harbor.
   That brought the confirmed death toll from Saturday's accident
to 29, a coast guard official said. Still missing was a 24-year-old
woman, Mami Yuhara.
   Forty-eight people were on board the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru to
fishing boat when it collided with the submarine, which was
cruising on the surface of the water across the busy shipping lane.
The vessel sank in less than two minutes and 19 people were rescued.
   No injuries were reported among the 75 men on board the
submarine, which was almost undamaged.
   The salvage team, using a massive crane, winched the boat to the
surface from a depth of about 160 feet.
   The coard guard official said a long, narrow hole under the bow
of the ship indicated the impact from the submarine, which probably
lifted up the front of the boat and caused it to sink stern-first.
   Survivors and newspapers have charged that the submarine's crew
members stood by watching on the deck as victims sank out of sight
in the water.
   ``I saw the men on the submarine, so I called out, `Why don't
you help?''' one survivor told reporters. ``But even though there
were more than 10 of them watching, they didn't do anything,'' she
said.
   The submarine picked up only three survivors.
   News reports Wednesday said Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara
has offered to resign over the accident but would stay on until an
investigation was completed.
   News reports have suggested the submarine, the 2,200-ton
Nadashio, may have erred in continuing on its course after sighting
the fishing boat before the collision.
   But news reports quoted the fishing boat's surviving crew as
saying the Nadashio, on the left, blasted its horn to warn the boat
of its approach.
   Adm. Shuichiro Higashiyama, navy chief of staff, said Wednesday
he believed the submarine's crew had taken proper measures to avoid
the accident.
   Defense officials have said the collision was the worst between
Japanese navy and civilian vessels since World War II.

<HEAD>Elections Board: Schneider, Sundlun, Chafee Can Stay on the Ballot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John H. Chafee, Rep. Claudine C.
Schneider and gubernatorial candidate Bruce G. Sundlun can remain
on this November's ballot despite discrepancies in their filing
papers, the state Board of Elections ruled Wednesday.
   The discrepancies between the candidates' declarations of
candidacy and their voter registration cards included a missing
middle initial in a signature and a street that was listed as an
avenue.
   Opponents had challenged the candidacies of Chafee, Sundlun and
Schneider, saying they violated a state law requiring declarations
of candidacy and voter registration cards to match exactly.
   But the elections board said the discrepancies weren't important
enough to disqualify the candidates.
   Board chairman Joseph R. DiStefano said after Wednesday's
hearing that the board would ask the General Assembly to amend the
law next year to allow minor variations in signatures. The current
statute, which has been in effect since 1950, may be more exacting
than needed to prevent fraud, he said.
   ``The question is, is it overkill?'' DiStefano said. ``Could we
have had a less stringent requirement to accommodate the given
purpose? I think so.''
   Schneider, a Republican, was accused of signing her declaration
with her initial, but leaving it off her voter registration card.
Schneider also listed her address on the form as Central Avenue
instead of Central Street.
   She argued that she made the same signature error on her 1986
candidacy papers, and that was not challenged by the board at the
time.
   As for Schneider's address, the board said, ``This board has
interpreted the statute in its prior rulings so as to permit some
variation in the address so long as there no substantial variance.''
   Sundlun, the Democratic candidate for governor, signed his
declaration with his initials, but his registration card spells out
his first name, and included the word ``street,'' which was omitted
from his address on his registration.
   Sundlun said he signed both forms with his initials, but someone
added ``ruce'' to his first name on the registration card without
his knowledge later.
   ``Mr. Sundlun is not chargeable with knowledge of or
responsibility for an unauthorized alteration of his signature on
the voter registration card,'' the board ruled.
   Chafee's bid for a third term was been challenged by an
independent opponent because the senator listed his house number on
the form declaring his candidacy, while his voter registration card
left out the number.
   The Republican senator told the Board of Elections that when he
bought his house in Warwick in 1961, the homes there had not yet
been numbered.
   Sundlun said that if he is elected, he would seek to make the
law governing candidacy declarations less stringent.
   ``I don't think any candidate should have to go through this,''
he said.

   Golfers at the Waterville Country Club
are experiencing a new barrier between them and that perfect game:
foxes that steal their golf balls and stash them in sand-trap
hideaways.
   During one recent tournament, the fleet-footed critters swiped
the golf balls of all three players on one team and forced the
players to drop out of competition, pro-shop employee Robert
Timmons said Wednesday.
   ``It's a very common occurrence to have them (the foxes) stand
five or six feet away,'' said Timmins, who plays the 18-hole course
frequently.
   Foxes have burrowed holes in two sand traps at the central Maine
course; pups emerging from their dens sun themselves while golfers
chip and putt.
   Golfers are also distracted by deer that meander across fairways
and Canada geese and mallards whose droppings near ponds create a
hazard of their own.
   One golfer blamed a fawn for his failure to break 100. He said
he was searching for his ball in the rough when the young deer's
mother let out a warning sound, forcing him away.
   Timmins said golfers are also interrupted occasionally by deer
that meander across fairways, Canada geese and mallards near ponds,
a snapping turtle and a few muskrats which wander onto the course.
   However, he added, most players are amused, rather than
aggravated, by the wildlife.

   A crowd at the Jackson Municipal Airport
watched in wonder as Rudolph, Dancer and Prancer flew into Jackson
this week _ but they weren't pulling Santa's sleigh nor did they
hail from the North Pole.
   The young reindeer jetted in on Delta Air Lines with new owners
Shirley and Raburn May, who purchased the trio during a weeklong
trip to Alaska.
   The Mays and the reindeer quickly attracted a crowd wanting a
peek at the animals usually seen in Mississippi only on Christmas
Eve.
   ``I've never seen no reindeer before, except on TV,'' said
24-year-old Sylvester Lewis, peeking at the grayish-brown reindeer
in animal carriers.
   After a brief pause at the baggage area, the animals boarded a
trailer for the 70-mile trip to their new home _ the Mays' Lazy
Acres Christmas Tree Farm.
   The reindeer are the first to be owned privately in the state,
Shirley May said.

   Joe Prissel's steer hung around the Pepin
County Fair long enough to be judged grand champion. Then the beast
bolted for freedom.
   The 1,050-pound Hereford went on an hour and a half tour of the
Arkansaw countryside before being captured in time to be sold at
the annual livestock auction Tuesday night.
   ``At least people will have something to talk about,`` said
steer owner Joe Prissel. ``This doesn't happen every year at the
fair.''
   Prissel's grandson, Dave Prissel, had been showing the steer
during showmanship and market class beef competition. The steer was
named grand champion, and Prissel was asked to lead the animal from
the single-rope show ring so a reserve champion could be named.
   The steer, irritated by the heat and parading during earlier
competition, saw an opening toward the barns and took off.
   About eight people followed the steer but lost sight of the
animal after it rounded a corner near Highway N. The search party
followed hoofprints until they entered a creek. Then the searchers
combed the prairie and fields adjacent to the creek, but finally
gave up.
   Eventually the animal was spotted in the village. It was
captured and brought back to the fairgrounds in time to be sold to
Randy Weber of Durand for 90 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Kohl's Contribution Recipients Topped By Earl</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate candidate Herbert Kohl, criticized by
rival Anthony Earl for his political contributions, released a list
Wednesday showing that the person to benefit most from his
donations has been Earl himself.
   The list showed Kohl, multimillionaire owner of the Milwaukee
Bucks basketball team, made 290 political contributions since 1975
with a total of $9,000 going to Earl for his gubernatorial
campaigns in 1982 and 1986. Earl was elected the first time but
lost two years ago.
   The two men are among several Democrats running in the Sept. 13
for nomination to the seat of retiring Sen. William Proxmire.
   Earl has questioned Kohl's commitment to Democratic causes,
pointing out that he made three contributions to Republican
senators during the early 1980s. Kohl's contributions, each for
$1,000, were to Minnesota incumbents David Durenberger in 1982 and
Rudy Boschwitz in 1983, and to Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming in 1982
when he won election to the Senate.
   Kohl's list includes almost $90,000 in contributions to
individuals and party committees at the federal, state and local
levels. The vast majority are Democrats, according to The Milwaukee
Journal, which was given a copy of the list.
   Kohl said Tuesday he had made the three contributions because he
had been solicited in each case by a friend. He said he had given
the money without consideration to the candidates' political stands.

<HEAD>Official Warns Against Overreacton To Pentagon Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the Defense Department shouldn't
overreact to the current Pentagon bribery investigation by passing
a lot of new laws and regulations, the head of a commission that
reviewed Pentagon business practices said Wednesday.
   Justice Department ``investigators must do everything possible
to identify the real criminals and bring them to justice and try to
do so in ways that will help to deter such action in the future,''
David Packard told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   But Packard, who headed a presidential commission that in 1986
recommended changes in the way the Pentagon purchases weapons and
other items, warned that ``I believe it is very important not to
overreact to these recently disclosed allegations.''
   ``This country has long-established legal procedures to deal
with crime,'' he said. ``They should not be pre-empted in the name
of military reform. To do so results in actions of a kind that
would be expected only in the most tyrannical type of a police
state.''
   ``Such actions are the antithesis of the very fundamental
concepts of a free society and a free enterprise economy,'' he
said. ``It is very hard for me to understand how this came about
during an administration dedicated to free enterprise.''
   Packard is chairman of the board of the Hewlett-Packard Company
and is a former deputy secretary of defense.
   His testimony was his first major comment on the current bribery
case, which involves allegations that defense contractors and
private consultants bribed Pentagon employes for inside information
about future contracts. No one has yet been charged.
   Criminal activity is a problem that should be handled by
professional investigators, Packard said, but losses to criminals
``are not large in comparison with the waste and inefficiences in
the major acquisition programs.''
   There are four major reasons for that waste and inefficiency, he
said, including lack of a ``world-wide military strategy,''
pressure on each of the four services to promote their own weapons,
annual congressional appropriations instead of multi-year spending,
and congressional spending for weapons and bases ``that are not
needed.''
   He said there have ``been many positive steps in the right
direction'' in implementing the changes proposed by his commission.
   But he added that the breakdown of the procurement system is
caused by congressional attempts to impose competition among
defense contractors where it is ``virtually impossible to achieve''
or with regulations enforced ``by what I consider to be identical
to `police state' tactics.''
   In the private sector, he said, ``price is seldom, if ever, the
only factor in purchasing a product or awarding a contract. The
quality of the product is almost always more important and the
support and service the supplier can provide are also more
important than price alone.''

<HEAD>Navy Investigating Gaines Relationship With Boeing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is investigating whether James
Gaines, a figure in the Pentagon procurement investigation,
violated the ethics code by dealing with his former employer, the
Boeing Co., a spokesman said Wednesday.
   Gaines flew to Seattle last October for a briefing on the latest
version of the P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft, manufactured by
Boeing, said Navy spokesman Lt. Brian Cullin.
   Gaines, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for acquisition
management, is a former Boeing executive who agreed after joining
the Pentagon to disqualify himself from any dealings with his
former employer.
   ``We don't know the extent of his involvement with Boeing in
that trip,'' said Cullin. ``We have referred it to the Naval
Investigative Service,'' a branch of the Navy which is working with
the Federal Bureau of investigation on the case.
   It was not whether anyone had approved Gaines' trip to Seattle,
Cullin said.
   Gaines is one of six Pentagon officials who were moved to other
duties after Justice Department disclosed that it was investigating
allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them
former military men, bribed defense officials for contracting
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of
dollars.
   In the Navy department, Gaines was a deputy to Melvyn Paisley,
the assistant secretary for research, engineering and systems.
Paisley had worked at Boeing for 28 years before he was recruited
by the then Navy Secretary John Lehman in 1981.
   Paisley, who left the Navy in 1987 to become a consultant,
recruited Gaines, with whom he had worked at Boeing in the 1970's.
   The Navy spokesman said his office had referred the matter to
the Naval Investigative Service last week, ``bringing to their
attention the disqualifier in his financial disclosure form that he
is prohibited from dealing with Boeing.''
   ``Our feeling was that an investigation was needed to determine
whether Gaines had violated U.S. code 208, which governs ethics
cases,'' said Cullin.
   Gaines' financial disclosure form, released through the Navy,
said Boeing would pay him a lifetime pension his service with the
company, which ended Sept. 30, 1985, and would include him in its
major medical plan until he turned 65.
   Because of Gaines' continuing financial relationship with
Boeing, through the pension and health insurance plans, Navy
officials sent him a letter on Sept. 19, 1986, saying that ``you
are hereby disqualified from taking any action in connection with
matters involving these firms (Boeing and its affiliates), or any
subsidiary or affiliates of these firms.''
   ``Such actions include, but are not limited to, participation in
program reviews, approval of funding actions, review of Acquisition
Plans and Justifications and Approvals,'' said the letter, which
was released by the Navy.
   The letter was signed by Richard L. Rumpf, principal deputy
assistant secretary of the Navy for Research, Engineering and
Systems.
   A spokesman for the Naval Investigative Service said the agency
would have no comment and referred all questions to the Navy.

   The IRA says it is
investigating botched operations that have killed 17 civilians
recently and damaged its image in the guerrilla campaign to drive
the British from this troubled province.
   The Irish Republican Army prides itself on attacking only
security forces, sparing civilians, but even some staunch
supporters have criticized the blunders.
   One is Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's legal political wing
Sinn Fein and a member of the British Parliament. After a bomb
exploded outside a public swimming pool in West Belfast earlier
this month, killing two of his Roman Catholic constituents, he said
the IRA must ``get its house in order.''
   Four recent bombings have been bungled, beginning with one that
killed 11 Protestant men, women and children in November at a
memorial service for Britain's war dead at Enniskillen. The attack
inspired international condemnation of the IRA.
   IRA statements said the bomb was radio-controlled to explode as
soldiers marched by but British electronic scanners may have
detonated it prematurely.
   OnSaturday, a misdirected bomb killed a Protestant family of
three returning from a vacation in the United States.
   At first the IRA said they were ``victims of mistaken
identity,'' then claimed the 1,000-pound bomb was detonated by
British army scanning equipment.
   On Wednesday, the IRA said High Court Judge Ian Higgins, a
Catholic, was the intended target. Higgins and his family drove
home from a U.S. vacation at about the same time.
   In other admitted blunders, IRA men shot and killed a
21-year-old Protestant woman in March, then said her brother was
the intended target. The IRA said the brother belonged to the
Ulster Defense Regiment, but he was found to have no connection
with the security forces of the Protestant-dominated province.
   Its operatives planted a bomb on a schoolbus last month
intending to kill the driver, a part-time member of the Ulster
Defense Regiment. A dozen Protestant and Catholic teen-agers were
wounded, one seriously.
   Police superintendent Raymond Moore said in an interview:
``People who set out to kill other people have to accept the
consequences of their acts. I don't accept the word accident or
mistake. These people are criminal thugs waging war on the
population.''
   The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant extremist
group, claimed responsibility Tuesday for killing IRA member
Brendan Davidson, 33, shot at his home the previous day by three
men who reportedly wore police uniforms.
   Sinn Fein accused police of collusion with the killers, saying a
police patrol passed outside Davidson's home shortly before he was
killed.
   Sammy Wilson of the hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionist
Party says the religion of most victims indicates the overwhelming
Catholic IRA targets Protestants.
   Sinn Fein is sensitive to the charge of sectarianism and denies
such a motive.
   Jackie Donnelly, a Sinn Fein spokesman, said every blunder ``is
very, very serious and tragic'' and the IRA cancels more operations
than it conducts for fear of civilian casualties.
   ``If you take the amount of operations the IRA have successfully
carried out over the last 18 years and put it beside the list of
mistakes ... they're very minimal,'' he said in an interview.
   He added, however, that a ``very serious inquiry'' into civilian
deaths is under way because ``no one realizes more than the IRA
that bad operations can damage them.''
   Donnelly said the IRA was examining whether remote-controlled
devices have been tampered with, and possible carelessness by its
operatives.
   Theories abound on why the IRA is missing targets.
   Moore said self-protection measures by security forces make
attackers run more risks.
   Seamus Mallon, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party,
a moderate Catholic group, said the IRA is using the ``dregs of the
organization'' as operatives.
   ``It seems to me that they are not getting the young people of
ability that they did in the past, and because of that their
expertise simply does not exist,'' he said on Radio Ulster.
   Eamonn Mallie, a journalists and co-author of a book about the
IRA, says there is a split within the organization but Donnelly
denied it.
   ``The IRA have never been as united as what they are now,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Senate Wants To `Reassess' U.S.-China Relations Over Mideast
Missiles</HEAD>

   The Senate on Wednesday approved $15 billion
for the State, Justice and Commerce departments after calling on
the Reagan administration to reassess U.S. relations with China if
Beijing does not stop selling missiles in the Middle East.
   The bill, which was approved 80-16, was the 11th appropriations
bill the Senate has passed this year. The measure now goes to
conference with the House, which passed its own version of the
measure last month, pegged to a far lower $7 billion spending level.
   The measure includes $7.5 million to establish a U.S.-based
television station to broadcast news, information and entertainment
to Cuba. The station, to be known as Television Marti, would be a
follow-on to Radio Marti, which has been in operation since 1983.
   The proposal was sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who
said Television Marti would ``send the message of democracy to
everyone in Cuba.''
   Acting on amendments, the Senate adopted, 97-0, a proposal by
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas calling on China to
immediately halt the sale of ballistic missiles and other
``destabilizing'' weapons in the Middle East.
   It urged China to cut off discussions with Syria, Iran, Libya
and Pakistan about possible missile sales.
   And it declared: ``If these sales and policies are not
discontinued, the United States should reassess its relations with
the Peoples Republic of China and reexamine agreements or
contemplated agreements providing for arms and technology transfers
to the peoples Republic of China.''
   Acting on other amendments, the Senate approved:
   _A proposal by Dole creating within the State Department the
position of ``special envoy to the Afghanistan resistance'' to
coordinate U.S. policies toward the anti-Soviet rebels.
   Noting the on-going Soviet troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, Dole
told the Senate: ``Now more than ever we need to make sure we are
on top of events in Afghanistan, in touch with, and closely
coordinating our activities with the resistance ... and doing what
makes the most sense diplomatically, to advance our strategic and
political goals.''
   _A sense-of-the-Senate amendment from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
expressing support for human rights in Soviet Armenia. Armenian
activists have been leading an unsuccessful campaign to have a
predominantly Armenian region of the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan rejoined to Armenia.
   Armenians who form a majority of the 162,000 population in the
contested region in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan allege
mistreatment by the Azerbaijani government. They began a vocal
campaign in February to join the Soviet republic of Armenia, but
the Soviet leadership last week rejected the annexation bid.
   _An amendment by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., urging the
administration to fully fund the peacekeeping operations of the
United Nations.
   After objections from the managers of the bill, Pell dropped an
attempt to transfer $100 million from the Defense Department and
use it to support the United Nations.
   Pell said he will pursue the matter at a hearing Friday
featuring testimony from Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations.

<HEAD>Study Says Cutting Defense Budget Further Could Affect Readiness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next administration will have a difficult
time reducing the defense budget because much of the budget goes
for personnel and affects the nation's military preparedness, a
study released Wednesday warned.
   The current Pentagon budget is about $300 billion a year and has
doubled during the eight years of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   A total of 55 percent of the budget is spent for a category
known as ``operation and support (O&S)'' which covers pay for the
nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel and a variety of
other daily expenses, the Congressional Budget Office said.
   Reagan has approved a series of pay increases for the troops, a
move hailed by Republicans and Democrats alike as having improved
the quality of military recruits.
   But after five years of large annual increases in defense
spending, the Pentagon budget has been frozen the past three years
and both Republican and Democratic leaders have predicted that no
major defense budget increases are likely in the near future.
   Aside from reducing spending on personnel, the Pentagon could
cut future spending by reducing the number of new weapons it buys.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci earlier this year announced
layoffs among the civilian Pentagon workforce as part of the effort
to meet lower-than-forecast defense budgets.
   As the Pentagon ``modifies its budget to conform with likely
fiscal realities, some further reduction in the number of forces
could occur,'' the CBO study said. ``These reductions would
adversely affect U.S. military capability...
   ``Decreases in O&S spending could be serious because they are
associated with military readiness, which is defined as the ability
of U.S. forces to fight well early in a war,'' the CBO said.
   ``Readiness is considered crucial by many military analysts,
since it determines how well active forces could respond to
surprise attacks, and how rapidly reserve forces would be available
to augment them,'' it said. ``It is enhanced if forces are fully
equipped, manned, and trained in peactime and operations spending
influences manning and training.''

<HEAD>Beach Remains Closed After Rats Wash Ashore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now decomposed rats have washed ashore on New
York City beaches, joining medical waste in a bounty of unwanted
debris that has closed many East Coast recreation areas this summer.
   Altogether, 10 of the 14.3 miles of beaches administered by the
city Parks Department were closed because of debris Wednesday. In
addition, most of the beaches in the Gateway National Recreation
Area remained closed.
   ``It's very disappointing to us,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry
Stern, who added that he hoped investigators would find who was
responsible for the illegal dumping ``and send them away for a long
time.''
   While officials in New York said they were baffled by the
seaborne invasion of debris, authorities in Rhode Island said they
had traced medical waste that washed ashore in that state to New
York-area hospitals, drug stores and ambulances.
   Nine rats were among the 246 pieces of waste that were found at
Rockaway Beach on Tuesday, according to Health Department spokesman
Barry Adkins. At least 24 more pieces of debris were found
Wednesday. Most of the items were syringes, Adkins said.
   Rockaway Beach, which ordinarily attracts hundreds of thousands
of bathers on hot summer days, remained closed.
   Health Department officials initially thought the rats had been
used in laboratories because they appeared to have been
systematically shaved, but Adkins said investigators later
determined the rodents' hair had fallen out in clumps due to
decomposition.
   ``There is no evidence that they are laboratory rats,'' Adkins
said.
   On Long Island, Nassau County officials reported the discovery
of what appeared to be infectious medical waste at the town of
Hempstead's oceanside transfer station.
   Health Department spokeswoman Shelly Feuer Domash said the waste
had been traced to the South Nassau Communities Hospital in
Oceanside.
   However, a spokesman for the hospital said all the material had
undergone a high-temperature sterilizing procedure and was allowed
at the transfer station.
   In Rhode Island, officials have found at least 60 items in
recent weeks, including needles and syringes, catheter bags, rubber
tubing, a colostomy bag and respirator parts. Waste continued to
wash ashore on Wednesday.
   ``Everything that we're picking up is coming back to the same
geographic source,'' said Ronald L. DiOrio, policy director for
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete. ``All of the evidence coming in at this
point points to the New York general area.''
   A 9-inch-long sign, inscribed ``NYCEMS,'' washed ashore last
Thursday in Nantucket, Mass., said John Stobierski, a spokesman for
the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
   Officials believe the sign stands for New York City Emergency
Medical Service, which provides ambulance services for that city's
health and hospitals division, DiOrio said.
   ``The sign has washed up, but that doesn't explain how it got
into the water,'' said Stobierski.
   ``We don't even have signs that say NYCEMS,'' Lt. Vicky
Bertland, of the medical service, said Wednesday. She said she
could not comment further without seeing the sign.

   Kimberly Conrad's grandmother said
Wednesday she was delighted to learn that Playboy magazine founder
Hugh Hefner had proposed to her granddaughter.
   Lila Aldridge, 67, said she talked with Hefner by telephone
Sunday night and ``he seemed like a very nice man and I'm happy
Kim's marrying him.''
   ``I wish them all the luck in the world,'' she said.
   A Hefner spokesman, Bruce Binkow, said Hefner ``popped the
question Saturday night at a romantic moment over the wishing well
at the Playboy Mansion.'' He said no wedding date has been set.
   Ms. Conrad, 24, who was Playboy's Miss January 1988, was born in
Moulton and lived there about four years. She has since lived in
Nevada and British Columbia.
   Hefner, 62, has been described in the magazine as a person who
lives by the motto ``Marriage is the death of hope.''
   Ms. Conrad moved into the mansion in January, along with her two
dogs, Leilynd and Dior, and a cat named Spooky.
   Hefner married Mildred M. Williams in 1949. The couple had two
children including daughter Christie Hefner, now president of the
Playboy business empire.
   Since his divorce more than 30 years ago, Hefner has advocated
the free-swinging lifestyle that came to be known as the ``Playboy
philosophy.''

<HEAD>NASA Poorly Prepared To Predict Weather For Space Launches, Panel
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Research Council study released
Wednesday said NASA needs to build a system to more accurately
predict weather conditions at the moment spacecraft are launched
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The study, which analyzed the system used by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to protect its spacecraft from
lightning and other adverse weather, said that major improvements
are needed in organization and in instruments.
   NASA, the panel said, ``has been poorly organized to provide
weather support and the result is a system that is less than
state-of-the-science,'' the report said. It noted that unless
improvements in the weather forecasting system are made at the
Kennedy center, ``weather will loom larger as a threat to a
rejuvenated and accelerated space flight program.''
   The study said that NASA must have a system that can accurately
forecast weather and lightning conditions that are valid for at
least two hours.
   ``Observations of lightning, electric fields aloft ... and rapid
wind variations are most urgently needed,'' the report said.
   John A. Ernst, director of NASA's weather support office, said
the space agency asked for the study and is now studying the
results.
   ``We've taken some initial steps and the recommendations confirm
that the steps we've taken are the right thing to do,'' said Ernst.
``We've got a better handle on the problem now.''
   The National Research Council recommended these actions:
   _Equipping an aircraft with instruments to measure electric
fields aloft and to gauge wind velocity and turbulance in the path
of a spacecraft to be launched or landed.
   _Installation of an instrument that will detect sudden wind
changes.
   _Installation of additional instruments to monitor the approach
of major thunderstorm systems.
   NASA managers were criticized in the study for not defining the
precise minimum weather conditions for a space shuttle launch.
   ``The weather support system has not been able to concentrate
sufficiently on the special problems of the space shuttle,'' the
report said. ``Some critical parameters are currently not measured
_ such as drop sizes in clouds and rain, which are hazardous
because of the possibility of protective tile damage _ and there is
no program to initiate these types of measurements,'' the report
said.
   Ernst said that the agency is planning to put special weather
instruments aboard an airplane that will cruise near the space
center during a space launch countdown. He said the airplane will
be equipped to measure the potential for lightning in clouds up to
45,000 feet.
   NASA also is installing instruments on a buoy anchored in the
Atlantic Ocean east of the launch pad. Ernst said this should give
more information on approaching thunderstorms.
   Additionally, he said, the space agency is planning to install a
radar which will warn of wind shear turbulence.
   NASA requested the NRC study when lightning caused the
destruction of an Atlas-Centaur rocket after it was launched from
the Kennedy Space Center. Later studies showed the rocket was hit
by four strokes of lightning 48 seconds after liftoff. The
electrical discharge disrupted an on-board computer memory system
and the vehicle went out of control. NASA destroyed the rocket to
protect property and people downrange, using a signal from the
ground.
   At the time of the Atlas-Centaur destruction, the National
Research Council panel said, NASA and the Air Weather Service of
the Air Force were operating one of the largest networks of
electrical field measurements in the world. Yet, the report said,
these measurements had not been entered into the system that
committed to launch.
   Rockets, as they rise from the launch pad and streak toward
space, are able to trigger lightning if they penetrate clouds that
contain high charges of electricity. The tail of hot gases
streaming from the rockets can actually form a conduction path for
the lightning charge to flow to the ground.
   Triggered lightning has hit only one piloted U.S. spacecraft.
Apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning as it was launched on Nov.
14, 1969. The electrical charge temporarily disrupted
communications and permanently damaged nine non-essential circuits,
but the spacecraft and its astronauts successfully completed the
second manned landing on the moon.
   The National Research Council is the principal operating arm of
the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of
Engineering.

   The United States will have to develop
advanced rocket systems if the nation plans to launch the Star Wars
defense system or to send people to Mars someday, the Office of
Technology Assessment said in a study released Wednesday.
   OTA, a research agency that serves Congress, issued what it
called a ``buyers' guide'' outlining the options Congress could
consider if it decides to go shopping for new rocket systems.
   To continue the nation's space program at about the rate of the
era before the Challenger accident, the OTA said the ``best buy''
would be to improve the space shuttle and the existing fleet of
expendable rockets _ Titan, Atlas-Centaur and Delta.
   ``This approach would have little technical risk and would
require a small investment,'' the report said.
   To achieve an increase in U.S. launches by about 5 percent a
year, the OTA suggested four options: increased production and more
launch sites for the current rockets; modification of current
rockets so they can carry more cargo; development of a cargo ship,
called Shuttle-C, based on space shuttle technology; or
construction of a new rocket based on current technology.
   The agency said that if the nation decides to deploy Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or to send
people to Mars it will need to invest in new rocket technology to
reduce cost, increase performance and provide flexibility.
   It said such new technology could be developed three ways: an
Air Force proposal to build an advanced, expendable rocket; a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration proposal to build a
new generation of space shuttle, called the Shuttle II; or
development of a National Aerospace Plane, a hypersonic aircraft
capable of taking off from a runway and flying into orbit.
   The OTA said the Air Force advanced launch rocket would be the
cheapest, least technically challenging and could be ready by the
end of this century. The other two would take longer and cost more,
but a Shuttle II would preserve the nation's ability to send humans
into orbit, the study said.
   The report said the United States has, or can develop, the
technology for any of the options, but ``it lacks the resources to
pursue them all simultaneously'' and Congress will have to make a
choice.

<TEXT>
   A vital test-firing of space shuttle
Discovery's three main engines has been delayed again, until
Monday, because of a faulty fuel valve and other problems, the
space agency announced Wednesday.
   The troubles halted a practice countdown during which the
spaceship's external fuel tank was to have been loaded Wednesday
night, the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the
Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Officials said the count was held up several hours by the need
to replace a fuel valve. Other technical problems also contributed
to the delay.
   The flight readiness firing of the three engines had been set
for Saturday, but earlier this week was put off until Sunday to
give technicians more time to close out the engine compartment.
   Under the new schedule, the fuel tank now will be loaded with
half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen on
Thursday night and the countdown will be taken down to 10 seconds
before a mock liftoff.
   At that point, a simulated problem will force a ``launch''
delay. Engineers then will rehearse what is called a 72-hour launch
turnaround. They will drain the fuel from the tank and start
another countdown, aiming for a firing of the engines at 7:30 a.m.
Monday.
   The 20-second firing will test several modifications made to the
engines and is essential to certifying Discovery for the first
post-Challenger shuttle launch.
   Elsewhere, engineers seemed to be favoring cutting a hole in
Discovery's rear cargo bay wall as the best approach to repair a
small gas leak without having to take the shuttle off the launch
pad. Moving the shuttle could delay the planned early September
launch by as much as two months.
   Cutting the hole would enable experts to reach the
otherwise-inaccessible leak, which is in a fitting on a line
leading to an oxidizer tank in an engine compartment. They could
either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a clamshell
device filled with an epoxy sealant.
   NASA officials estimate this approach would take 10 days to two
weeks.
   Engineers still are testing a method in which a device
resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the
27-foot-long vent line trailing a sealing agent.
   No decision is expected until after the main engine firing on
whether to try to fix the leak on the pad or to roll Discovery back
to a hangar for repair. Even if the leak can be repaired don the
pad, officials expect the launch to slip past mid-September.
   The leak is in a steering engine system, separate from the main
engines which are to be test-fired.

<HEAD>Agruculture Department Says Rains Slowing Soviet Grain Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too much rain has slowed this summer's grain
harvest in the Soviet Union, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   ``Rains accompanied by strong winds reportedly have caused
lodging (tangling), impeding the early grain harvest in European
U.S.S.R. this year,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said. ``Despite the unfavorable conditions, some areas are
reporting excellent winter grain yields.''
   As of July 18, grain and pulses, which include peas and beans,
had been cut on 14.9 million hectares, of which 9.8 million had
been threshed, the report said. That was below the four-year
average of 23.5 million hectares cut and 18.6 million harvested by
this time between 1983 and 1986.
   Even so, harvest progress is ahead of the year-ago pace when the
season was late and only 8.9 million hectares were cut and 5.4
million harvested by now, the report said.
   In all, the Soviet Union has around 116 million hectares for
harvest this year. One hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres.
   The 1987 Soviet grain harvest went on to produce an estimated
211.4 million metric tons, and this year's has been forecast by
USDA at 215 million tons, one of the largest on record.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

Tests</HEAD>

   Foreign countries selling meat and poultry to
the United States would have to be certified annually that their
programs to control drug contamination meet U.S. standards, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The proposal responds to the requirements of the 1985 farm law,
said Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service.
   Under the plan, the agency would certify that each country _ 34
now are eligible to ship meat and poultry into the United States _
uses reliable analytical methods to determine whether products
contain residues of drugs or other chemicals that are within U.S.
limits.
   ``For many years, we have required foreign countries that export
meat and poultry to the United States to have a system of
inspection that is equal to our domestic inspection system,''
Crawford said.
   He added: ``In recent years, the legal requirements governing
how we regulate imported meat and poultry have become increasingly
strict, especially with respect to oversight of residue-control
programs.''
   The proposal would provide that if a country's program was not
certified, the country would lose its eligibility to ship meat and
poultry to the United States.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent through Sept. 26 to:
Policy Office, Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3171-S, USDA,
Washington, D.C. 20250.

<HEAD>Bakker's Former Ministry Drops PTL Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The TV ministry formerly run by Jim and
Tammy Bakker has dropped the name PTL in an effort to dissociate
itself from PTL's bankrupt commercial operations.
   The network ministry show formerly called ``PTL Today'' went on
the air without a name Tuesday morning, and viewers were asked to
send donations to a new entity called Heritage Ministries, not PTL.
   ``The address is the same, but for the first time you can write
`Heritage Ministries' on your checks,'' Heritage Village Church
Pastor Sam Johnson said Tuesday in a guest appearance on the show.
   Heritage Ministries must operate independently of PTL's
commercial operations, including the Heritage Park Christian theme
park, beginning Monday, PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said
Tuesday. PTL is trying to sell those properties to settle its debts.
   ``Heritage Ministries is on its own next week,'' Benton said.
``They've been learning to stand and now they have to go on their
own legs.''
   The television show sported a new look Tuesday. Johnson appeared
on a set featuring leather furniture and a study with a bookcase
backdrop. He said the set cost less than $900. The old set was
larger, had more furniture, and gave the appearnace of a large,
informal family room.
   ``We're starting brand new,'' Johnson said. ``We don't have any
money or any debts.''
   In addition to the name change, Heritage Ministries is trying
win authorization from the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt
organization.
   PTL was forced into bankruptcy after Bakker resigned following
the revelation that he had a sexual liaison with church secretary
Jessica Hahn and paid her hush money.
   Heritage Ministries Interim President Don Edwards said the new
ministry has been incorporated since May 25 and has a budget based
on an expected $60,000 a day in donations.
   Donations have been running well below that level for the last
month, but Benton said he thought many supporters were holding back
until the new ministry started.
   ``We hope to get off to a good start,'' Benton said. ``We'll
know Monday what kind of response we're getting from our partners.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds on July 19 gave Heritage
Ministries 30 days to prove it is financially viable, Edwards said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Procurement Probe Prompts Delaying Announcement Of
Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, displaying extreme sensitivity
in the wake of the defense procurement investigation, delayed for
one day the announcement of a routine contract with the parent
company of a firm suspended in the case, sources said Wednesday.
   ``We pulled it for a day to get ready for questions we expected
in response to the announcement,'' said one Pentagon official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Under the $3.5 million deal, announced Wednesday, Varian
Associates Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., was to repair or replace
electronic tubes for the Navy's Close-In Weapons System of the
Phalanx anti-missile gun.
   The deal was scheduled for release on Tuesday, but the
announcement was delayed, said three Pentagon sources.
   ``We wanted to make sure that the company was not on the list,''
said one Pentagon official.
   A Varian affiliate, Varian Continental, has been suspended from
doing business with the Pentagon because it was implicated in the
defense procurement investigation. And Varian Continental suspended
Joseph Bradley, the company vice president for marketing.
   Pentagon and Navy officials say they have seen no evidence
implicating the parent company in the investigation.
   Gary Sampson, a spokesman for the parent company, Varian
Associates, described the contract as routine.

   Deposed Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
may have faked reports about carloads of gunmen to divert attention
from reports that he offered $5 billion for permission to return
home, the Philippines consul said Wednesday.
   ``Frankly, this is another one of Marcos' imbecilities,'' said
Tomas Gomez, the Philippine consul general here. ``Every time
Marcos finds himself in thick soup, he does something bizarre.''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, spent Tuesday night at a friend's
home following a report that guards saw guns sticking out the
windows of three cars driving by their home, according to Marcos
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   The Marcoses returned home Wednesday and ``feel it's a little
bit safer,'' Trinidad said.
   The Marcos household had been warned of a plot to kill Marcos
before the cars drove past, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said.
   In the Philippines, spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Wednesday he
didn't know anything about the report and didn't want to comment
``because one of the world's master illusionists is at work.''
   The report of gunmen came on the same day that a published
report said Marcos had offered to pay the Philippine government $5
billion in exchange for being allowed to return to his homeland
free from criminal prosecution. Marcos admitted negotiations are in
progress but said money was not involved.
   Gomez, who keeps tabs on Marcos for the Philippine government,
said he believed the alleged threat was a ploy to draw attention
from the published report.
   Trinidad said Tuesday that Marcos' guards, who were on foot,
chased the cars but could not get a description because it was
early in the morning and still dark. No shots were fired and no one
was injured, he said.
   A Honolulu police dispatcher said the incident was not reported.
   Trinidad said the Marcoses were awakened shortly after the cars
drove by and driven to the friend's home.
   Marcos has lived in Hawaii since his ouster in a
civilian-military revolt in February 1986 that brought President
Corazon Aquino to power. Marcos, his family and associates are
alleged to have stolen up to $10 billion from the Philippine
treasury during his 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from exile in
Hawaii. In January 1987, U.S. authorities barred Marcos and his
wife from leaving Oahu Island following a coup attempt in Manila by
his followers.

<HEAD>Republicans File Suit to Block Release of Democratic Campaign
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans filed suit Wednesday to prevent
the Federal Election Commission from releasing $46 million in
public campaign funds to Michael Dukakis and his Democratic running
mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee also asked the
court to issue an injunction to keep the Treasury Department from
acting on Tuesday's decision by the FEC that cleared the way for
the Dukakis-Bentsen team to get the public funds allowed general
election presidential contenders.
   Bentsen is also seeking re-election to his Senate seat in Texas.
   ``We asked the (District of Columbia) Court of Appeals to stop
the Treasury Department from acting on the FEC certification of the
funds for Dukakis-Bentsen until the court hears our case,'' said
Ben Ginsberg, legal counsel for the NRSC.
   The Republicans contend Bentsen's situation violates federal
election law and gives the Democratic presidential ticket an unfair
financial advantage.
   An unusual Texas law allows Bentsen to run for re-election as
senator and seek the vice presidency at the same time.
   The Senate race is funded with private contributions. But
federal law forbids private funds in the presidential general
election race, since each party nominee receives $46 million from
the $1 voluntary income tax checkoff fund.
   In the suit, the NRSC charged that the FEC acted in an
``arbitrary and capricious manner'' in its 6-0 vote on Tuesday
rejecting the group's petition seeking to block release of the
public funds for Dukakis and Bentsen.
   ``We don't want to hold up Dukakis-Bentsen getting $46
million,'' Ginsberg said. ``We want to stop Dukakis-Bentsen from
getting $46 million-plus from the Senate (Re-Election) Committee.''
   In its complaint, the NRSC cited examples of Bentsen's use of
private funds for the general election campaign, including a
telegram sent by his Senate re-election committee asking for
support for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   The group also told the court it would be able to argue the case
on Monday, which falls within the 10-day period the FEC had to
decide on the petition.

<HEAD>NHTSA Opens Probe of Frame Cracking in Camaro, Firebird Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have opened a safety
investigation into alleged frame-cracking on more than 1.3 million
Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird cars, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday.
   The agency began its preliminary evaluation after receiving
three unconfirmed reports of cracks in the front of the cars'
frames.
   NHTSA said the cracks allegedly could cause the cars to go out
of control.
   The investigation, involving 1,302,736 cars from 1982-1985 model
years, is the lowest level of defect probe conducted by the agency.
   ``We are cooperating fully with them,'' said Bill Noack, General
Motors Corp. spokesman in Washington. ``We do point out that just
because there is the allegation of a defect does not mean a defect
exists.''
   NHTSA also ended an engineering analysis of alleged excessive
exhaust heat in 331,207 GM 20 and 30 series full-size pickup trucks
and vans, concluding there was insufficient evidence to show any
safety defect existed.
   The agency had opened the investigation after receiving
unconfirmed reports of 18 accidents.
   NHTSA also opened preliminary evaluations into these vehicles:
   _1987 Toyota Corolla: Two complaints alleged faulty wiring in
rear window defoggers tends to cause back-seat fires. The
investigation involves 170,000 cars.
   _1986-1987 Honda Legend and Accord: Four unconfirmed complaints
said inadequate fuel-system ventilation results in excessive
pressure in the fuel tank, leading to leakage and vapor release
when the gas cap is removed. The investigation involves 350,000
cars.
   _1988 Ford Lincoln Mark VII: Three complaints alleged the power
seat on the driver's side tends to move suddenly, startling the
driver and potentially causing a loss of control. The probe
involves 30,000 cars.
   _1988 Chrysler Medallion: Seven complaints alleged the cars
stall intermittently because of a wiring problem. NHTSA was unable
to say how many cars were involved in the investigation.
   _1984-1985 Chrysler Voyager: Six complaints alleged a front coil
spring tends to break, puncturing the front tire and causing the
possibility of a loss of control at high speeds. The investigation
involves 182,000 vehicles.

   Here, at a glance, are Wednesday's developments involving Iran,
Iraq and the United States:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ An offer by a senior Iranian official to help free
American hostages in Lebanon was dismissed Wednesday by the Reagan
administration as dated and not an indication Tehran wants to open
talks with the United States. Freeing the nine American hostages is
``a humanitarian issue'' and not subject to bartering with Iran
concerning Iranian assets frozen in the United States, said State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iranian rebels said they held the cities of
Eslamabad and nearby Karand, well inside Iran; had killed or
wounded thousands of Iranian soldiers and shot down two Iranian
warplanes and a helicopter gunship Wednesday. The claims could not
be independently verified. Iran complained that Iraqi planes
dropped chemical bombs near Bakhtaran, an Iranian provincial
capital.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said his
country will not be ``stampeded'' into a settlement and insists on
direct cease-fire negotiations with Iran. Ambassador Mohammad
Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran accused Iraq of stalling and sabotaging
U.N. efforts to end the war. He formally protested to the Security
Council that Iraq used chemical weapons Wednesday.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar urged both governments to
``help me in finding a solution through compromise.''

<HEAD>EPA Warns of Fines Against Non-Complying Sewage Treatment Plants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cities and towns still not in compliance with
federal sewage treatment requirements or on their way to compliance
should expect to pay fines, the government warned Wednesday.
   Eighty-six percent of the nation's sewage treatment plants
handling 95 percent of the nation's sewage flow met the July 1
deadline for subjecting their discharge to so-called ``secondary''
treatment _ treatment with bacteria to remove about 90 percent of
ordinary pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
   ``We think it is a success story ... largely attributable to
state agencies and municipalities,'' EPA Administrator Lee M.
Thomas told reporters at a news conference with Roger Mazrullah,
assistant attorney general for land and natural resources.
   ``We still have major water quality problems'' from other
sources, Thomas said. ``The resolution behind this effort is
exactly the resolution required to deal with the remaining issues.''
   Of the 2,095 non-complying treatment plants, more than
two-thirds are the subject of administrative or court settlements
containing compliance deadlines and setting out automatic penalties
for failure to meet them.
   The laggards are in every state but Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Kansas and New Mexico. All
plants in those states use secondary treatment.
   The worst states were Hawaii, 36 percent of plants complying;
Washington, 54 percent; and Ohio, 68 percent.
   It's the 629 remaining non-complying plants, a little over 4
percent of the overall total of 15,486, that were the subject of
the warning from Thomas and Marzullah.
   ``They should assume there probably will be a penalty,'' Thomas
said.
   EPA has won $7 million in penalties since 1984 and another $5
million was ordered by courts to be spent by local authorities on
environmental projects in lieu of fines. The maximum penalty is
$25,000 a day
   Of the 629 plants, 409 have been referred to the Justice
Department or state attorneys general for action. Most of the rest
already use secondary treatment and are disputing with EPA how much
``advanced'' treatment is required to remove toxic substances like
heavy metals.
   Asked about the recent discovery of medical waste on New York
beaches, Thomas said ``sensitive coastal environments are being
overwhelmed by pollution'' and sewage plant discharges were ``a
piece of the issue.''
   Among major coastal water problems, he singled out ``non-point
source'' pollution like fertilizer-laden agricultural runoff
``coming down tributaries into our estuaries'' and combined storm
sewer-sanitary sewer outflow in older cities.
   Thomas said he had ordered lawyers to research his authority
over hospital waste, but had doubts that he could legally require
it to be handled like hazardous waste.
   Some large non-complying sewage plants have tried to qualify for
waivers permitting them to discharge directly into the ocean after
``primary'' filtering and settling treatment removing roughly 40
percent of pollution.
   Applicants must show they will not degrade local water quality.
``It is a high hurdle to get over,'' Thomas said, and only a
quarter are successful.
   Marzullah said his office and the state of California filed a
joint suit Wednesday against the city of San Diego. San Diego had
won tentative approval for a waiver in 1981, but that approval was
reversed in 1986 and the city withdrew its application a year and a
half ago.
   Some communities had gambled on the availability of federal
grants, and they could now be out of luck. The roughly $2 billion
in annual grants is being converted to revolving loan funds in each
state, to be completed by 1994.
   EPA has distributed $42 billion in grants since 1972, when the
Clean Water Act originally set a 1977 deadline _ twice extended
since then.
   President Nixon vetoed the 1972 act on the grounds it was too
expensive, but was overridden. President Reagan twice vetoed the
last renewal, trying to hold the authorization to $12 billion
through 1994 instead of the $18 billion Congress approved.
   But Congress passed it successfully in 1987.

<HEAD>Two Railroads Vye For Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission heard from
two railroads Wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, which is on the auction block because of
a failed merger attempt last year.
   The Santa Fe Pacific Corp., had agreed to sell its Southern
Pacific subsidiary to Rio Grande Industries Inc., the parent
company of the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad for $1.02
billion.
   But the deal, which requires ICC approval, has run into strong
opposition from Kansas City Southern Industries, operator of the
Kansas City Southern Railroad, which has offered $1.25 billion for
the 13,000-mile rail system that stretches from Kansas City to the
West Coast.
   The ICC heard from both railroads Wednesday as it tries to
determine which buyer to choose, or whether it might approve both
applications and allow Santa Fe to choose.
   A decision is expected next month.
   Samuel Freeman, an attorney for Rio Grande Industries, told the
ICC in formal arguments that the company is in better financial
position to buy the Southern Pacific than is Kansas City Southern.
   ``The request (by Kansas City Southern that it be allowed to buy
the railroad) is unprecedented and unwarranted,'' he said.
   Rio Grande officials noted that Kansas City Southern faces a
possible $600 million settlement from a legal entanglement that
grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline
project.
   Kansas City Southern, however, maintained before the ICC that it
would be the most fit buyer of the Southern Pacific, arguing that
it is offering more money and plans to invest 20 percent more funds
in the railroad than the Rio Grande.
   ``We are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the
Southern Pacific,'' said Landon Rowland, president of Kansas City
Southern Industries. He said the company would invest more than $4
billion in the railroad over a five-year period.
   Kansas City Southern has accused the Santa Fe Pacific Corp., of
favoring the lower Rio Grande bid because the merger would benefit
the Santa Fe Railroad, the other rail line owned by Santa Fe
Pacific Corp.
   Jerome Donohoe, representing Santa Fe Pacific, said the company
has a binding contract with Rio Grande and could not complete the
sale this year if the ICC were to choose Kansas City Southern.
   The Southern Pacific was put up for sale under an ICC
divestiture order after the ICC last year rejected a planned merger
of the Southern Pacific with the Santa Fe.

   The majority of Americans can't find Great
Britain, France, Japan or the Persian Gulf on the map and have no
idea of what the U.S. population is, according to surveys conducted
by the Gallup Organization and the National Geographic Society.
   Moreover, Americans in the 18-24 age group ranked last when
their survey results were compared to similar tests conducted in
eight other nations, said the society, which sponsored the
international testing. Americans of all age group scored sixth.
   ``I have a terrible feeling that the American public is not
taking education as seriously as they have in the past _ and it's
not just geography. You are seeing this across the board,'' said
society President Gilbert M. Grosvenor at a news conference
Wednesday.
   The survey results indicated that three out of four Americans
couldn't locate the Persian Gulf, most couldn't come close to
guessing their own nation's population and the majority were lost
when it came to finding Britain, France or Japan.
   ``What was most alarming was not only that young Americans did
worse than all other 18- to 24-year-olds, but that they were the
only ones in that age group, among nine countries, who did worse
than the oldest group tested,'' Grosvenor said.
   ``We're not motivating our kids to take education seriously,''
he said noting recent National Science Foundation studies ranking
U.S. students well below their foreign counterparts in scientific
fields.
   To combat this, the society has launched a multimillion-dollar
public awareness campaign on the problem, he said.
   The campaign includes the initiation of a National Geography Bee
for secondary students, a training program for the nation's 15,000
geography and social studies teachers, and the free distribution of
an atlas of U.S. history in 35,000 public, private and parochial
schools.
   Another component involves the development of computer softwear
learning tools and a laser disc version of the atlas. The laser
disc, scheduled for release in late 1989, is a joint project with
Apple Computer and Lucas Films, producers of ``Star Wars.''
   The international survey tested 10,820 adults in Canada, France,
Italy, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States
and West Germany. Those surveyed were asked to locate 13 selected
countries, Central America, the Pacific Ocean and the Persian Gulf
on an unmarked world map.
   Out of a possible score of 16, the Americans ranked sixth with
an average of 8.6, on par with the British (8.5) but significantly
better than only the Italians (7.6) and Mexicans (7.4). Top honors
went to the Swedes (11.6) and West Germans (11.2), followed by the
Japanese (9.7), French (9.3) and Canadians (9.2).
   American youth received a score of 6.9, the lowest mark of all
youth tested and all other U.S. age groups.
   Overall, 75 percent of Americans placed the Persian Gulf in the
Red Sea, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea or the Indian Ocean.
   Forty-five percent did not know where Central America is
located. One-third identified Vietnam and less than half the
Americans were able to identify the United Kingdom, France, South
Africa and Japan.
   In a multiple-choice question, 57 percent of Americans tested
did not have a remote idea about the current U.S. population. Most
participants in Sweden, Japan and Canada chose the correct range
from a field of four: 150 to 300 million.
   In addition to the international quiz, a more comprehensive
battery of 81 questions, including a world map test, was
administered to 1,611 Americans by Gallup.
   The results, which Gallup senior study director Jeffrey S.
Friedman says can be projected to the U.S. population at large,
include:
   _Not more than half of adult Americans know that the Sandinistas
and Contras are fighting in Nicaragua and not in Iran, Lebanon or
Afghanistan.
   _About one-third could name four of the 16 NATO member
countries, another third failed to name any and 16 percent of those
questioned conferred membership on the Soviet Union.
   _Fifty percent failed to name any members of the Warsaw Pact, 20
percent could name four and more than one in 10 erroneously made
the U.S. a member.
   _Only 55 percent identified South Africa as the nation where
apartheid is an official policy.
   Americans generally did better on environmental questions, with
nearly 95 percent knowing that damage to the ozone layer would have
worldwide effect; 73 percent knowing wind patterns were responsible
for spreading the nuclear fallout from Chernobyl; and 68 percent
identifying acid rain as a particular problem in North America.
   While nearly 70 per cent of Americans tested agreed that the
ability to read a map was a necessity in today's world, more than
one third could not pick out the westernmost city on a simple map,
the survey indicated.

<HEAD>False Drug Tests Costs Job, Disrupt Lives, Congress Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Californians testified Wednesday that drug
tests which produced erroneous findings cost them their jobs and
caused terrible disruptions to their lives.
   Collette Clark of San Diego and Alan Pettigrew of San Francisco
told a House investigations subcommittee that they were required to
take a urinalysis which proved positive, although both said they
were not illegal drug users.
   Each was fired, but got their jobs back after filing a lawsuit
against their employers.
   Ms. Clark took a test because her employer, San Diego Gas and
Electric Co., required one for all new employees and those who were
to be promoted. A data entry operator, she was fired after her drug
test showed positive for marijuana.
   After she filed suit in 1986, it was determined that not only
were the results of her tests invalid, but the confirmatory test,
which the laboratory claimed it conducted, was, in fact, never
done. Her suit was settled out of court.
   ``I think that drug testing in the workplace is Machiavellian in
that the end result does not justify the means,'' Ms. Clark told
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations. ``Drugs in the workplace or any place else are
wrong, but so is drug testing _ and two wrongs have never made a
right.
   ``I do not think that a person's livelihood should depend on a
lab test result,'' she said. ``I know that I will never allow
myself to be left open to chance again, that if I have to submit to
the indignity of giving another urine sample, it will be on my own
terms, through my own choice of a lab and my own personal
physician.''
   There are bills pending in Congress calling for regulation of
drug-testing labs.
   Pettigrew was fired in 1985 as office manager for the vice
president of operations at Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
after a random urine test showed positive for cocaine.
   After filing suit and being reinstated at Southern Pacific as a
purchasing manager, his attorney established that the company was
unable to find a positive reading for cocaine, seven months after
his initial urinalysis, in the confirmation test.
   ``While I may be an example of what can go wrong with a false
positive, my example cannot, and should not, be shrugged off as
being an exception and not the rule,'' he said. ``One simple,
seemingly innocent urine test ruined my career, my life and the
health and welfare of my family.
   ``While drug testing may be seen as a way to cure this country's
drug problems, as long as there is the possibility of error in test
results and error in human judgment, drug testing in itself is a
fallacy,'' Pettigrew said.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Clues To Inheritance And Causes Of Asthma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Me. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have taken the first steps
toward understanding the causes and the inheritance of asthma with
the discovery of two asthma-related genes in laboratory mice.
   Roy Levitt of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in
Baltimore said Wednesday that learning how these genes work could
help doctors identify people at risk for asthma and also could
speed the development of better drugs to treat it.
   So far, Levitt and Wayne Mitzner, also of Johns Hopkins, have
shown that at least two genes can produce a hypersensitivity in the
bronchial tubes of mice.
   The increased sensitivity of the airways to drugs or
environmental agents, a phenomenon called increased bronchial
reactivity, ``is one of the hallmarks of asthma,'' Levitt and
Mitzner write in the current issue of The FASEB Journal, published
by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   Asthma is estimated to afflict about 6 percent of the
population, Levitt said.
   Levitt, who presented his findings at a genetics course at the
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, said increased bronchial
reactivity can lead both to asthma and to a serious lung disorder
called chronic obstructive lung disease, in which patients
experience extreme difficulty breathing.
   The causes of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease are
not known, but inherited genetic factors and exposure to agents in
the environment both play a role, Levitt said.
   Studies of families in which asthma was inherited showed that
even some family members without asthma had inherited an increased
bronchial reactivity.
   ``This seemed to suggest there could be a simple genetic basis
for airway hyper-reactivity, asthma and chronic obstructive lung
disease,'' Levitt said.
   He and Mitzner developed machines to monitor breathing in
laboratory mice, and they have determined that at least two
different genes in mice can lead to this bronchial sensitivity.
   It is not yet known whether these genes have counterparts in
humans, Levitt said.
   One of the genes has been shown to be inherited in mice as a
recessive genetic trait, meaning that an offspring would have to
inherit the defective gene from both of its parents in order to
have bronchial hyper-reactivity. Mice do not develop asthma, Levitt
said.
   The inheritance pattern of asthma in humans is not known, Levitt
said.
   Further studies of the asthma-related genes in mice should allow
researchers to look for similar genes in humans, he said.
   In order to demonstrate the bronchial hyper-reactivity in the
mice, the researchers had to expose the mice to agents thought to
be related to the development of asthma in humans.
   These agents, called serotonin and acetylcholine, are natural
substances used by nerve cells to communicate with one another.
   Some mice were sensitive to one of the agents, some to the other
and some to both.
   Studies of the different mice eventually led Levitt and Mitzner
to conclude that at least two different genes in the mice could
contribute to bronchial hyper-reactivity.

   An opposition legislator warned
Wednesday that a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite could spread
radiation across Europe when it falls to Earth later this year.
   Gerhard Schmid, a federal lawmaker in the opposition Social
Democrats, said the ``entire European Economic Community lies in
the geographical range'' of the falling satellite's path and that
the area could be peppered with radioactive debris.
   Schmid said Soviet officials confirmed the satellite left orbit
and was expected to re-enter the atmosphere in September. Western
sources have said it could crash in August or earlier.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, has reported that radio
contact was lost in April with the Cosmos 1900 satellite, launched
Dec. 12, 1987.
   In his statement, Schmid called for precautions, without saying
what they should be. He announced he had sent a letter about the
satellite to Jacques Delors, president of the European Economic
Community Commission.
   The Soviets have put 33 nuclear-powered satellites into space.
When one of them re-entered the atmosphere in 1978, it rained
thousands of pieces of radioactive debris on Canada.

<HEAD>House Clamps Down On Timber Harvesting In Alaska Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The environmental lobby scored a long-sought
victory Wednesday as the House passed 361-47 a bill to overhaul the
commercial timbering program in the Tongass National Forest in
Alaska.
   The measure, sent to the Senate, would scrap the 1980 law that
guarantees the U.S. Forest Service at least $40 million a year to
support timber sales from the nation's biggest national forest and
the continent's last large temperate rain forest.
   Supporters of the bill like the Wilderness Society say the
guarantee _ unique among U.S. forests _ has not only destroyed
ancient trees but handed huge losses to taxpayers, with Tongass
sales posting a deficit of $254 million from 1982 through 1987.
   Alaska's lone House member, Republican Don Young, argued that
the bill repudiates a deal made in 1980 with environmentalists when
Congress put huge portions of Alaska's vast acreage off-limits to
development.
   Young said that in return for allowing 8.5 million of the
forest's 17 million acres to be declared wilderness, Alaska
lawmakers won the spending guarantee and another requiring the
forest service to make an average of 450 million board feet of
Tongass timber available for sale each year.
   ``The leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word,'' said
Young, who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve
some 6,000 timber-related jobs in Southeast Alaska.
   ``It's a matter of jobs,'' Young said. ``There are people's
livelihoods at stake.''
   House supporters of the bill argued that the Tongass region
should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic
growth. They said over-harvesting the Tongass hurts both tourism
and fisheries.
   Besides getting rid of the guarantees, the overhaul bill
sponsored principally by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y, would put
another 1.7 million Tongass acres off-limits to timber cutting for
five years.
   Much of the Tongass timber is sold to two large corporations,
Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan and the Japanese-owned Alaska Lumber
and Pulp Co., which turn it into pulp, chiefly for export to Japan.
   The bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the
50-year contracts it entered into with these firms in the 1950s.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the bill's floor manager, said new
contracts are needed to encourage competition in Tongass timbering,
prevent excessive cutting of old-growth stands and ensure the firms
will pay more for Tongass trees.
   Miller said that a mature Sitka spruce from Tongass now sells
for $1.48, compared to $2 for a map of the national forest.

<HEAD>Private Investigator Blames Police in Palme Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man conducting a private probe into
the unsolved assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme told a
hearing Wednesday that authorities knew Palme's life may have been
in danger, but failed to act.
   ``If it is not a conspiracy, it is a stupidity so big that I
can't believe it exists even inside the Security Police,'' Ebbe
Carlsson told the Constitutional Committee in a hearing carried
live on national television.
   Carlsson also made note of wide reports of his homosexuality,
saying he had never made a secret of it and that it had nothing to
do with his investigation of Palme's assassination.
   Palme, the dominant figure in Sweden's post-World War II
politics, was shot in Stockholm on Feb. 28, 1986 as he was leaving
a movie theater with his wife. He was unguarded. Police failed to
find the killer or establish a motive.
   Carlsson, a publisher and editor, last year organized a secret,
unauthorized probe into the killing with financial help from a
banker.
   The investigation led to an uproar when it was revealed in the
press, along with reports that Carlsson subordinates tried to
smuggle illegal eavesdropping equipment into Sweden.
   Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon, who had secretly helped
Carlsson, resigned under pressure June 7.
   Carlsson has said he thought Palme was killed by Kurdish exiles,
possibly acting on orders from Iran. His theory holds that Iranian
leaders were angry with Palme because he tried to stop illegal
weapons sales to Iran.
   Carlsson said he spoke with the head of Security Police the day
before Palme was killed and was told that police learned from a
telephone tap that members of the Kurdish Workers Party in Sweden
were planning an assassination.
   ``Neither Olof Palme nor his colleagues got any part of the
information that the Security Police had,'' Carlsson said.
   The Kurds are an ethnic group seeking a separate state in part
of Iran and Iraq. A small group of leftist Kurdish exiles known as
the Kurdish Workers Party were mentioned in several reports during
the police investigation as perhaps organizing Palme's killing.
   The Palme government classified the group as a terrorist
organization and sentenced two of its purported members to life
imprisonment for killing two defectors from the group.
   Leading police and government officials, including Prime
Minister Ingvar Carlsson _ no relation to the publisher _ were also
scheduled to testify before the Standing Committee on the
Constitution, an independent parliamentary body that acts as a
watchdog to insure that the government follows the constitution.

   The U.S. economy grew at a slightly faster
rate than previously believed in 1987 and 1985 although the country
did experience one quarter in 1986 when the economy actually
contracted, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department announced those findings as it released
updated statistics on the gross national product, the country's
total output of goods and services.
   Each year, the government goes back and revises its earlier
estimates of GNP growth to take into account additional
information. The revisions boosted growth rates in 1987 and 1985
while lowering the growth rate slightly in 1986.
   The government said it underestimated growth rates in large part
because it failed to record all of the consumer spending that
occurred in previous years.
   The largest revision took place in 1987. GNP growth for that
year is now estimated at 3.4 percent, up from a previous estimate
of 2.9 percent growth.
   GNP growth in 1985 was revised up to 3.4 percent, compared with
an earlier estimate of 3 percent growth. Growth for 1986 was
lowered to 2.8 percent instead of the previous 2.9 percent.
   In addition, the government reported that the economy actually
contracted in one quarter in 1986, falling by 0.8 percent in the
second quarter, instead of rising by 0.6 percent as previously
believed.
   However, that one-quarter decline was not enough to spell an end
to the current recovery from the 1981-82 recession. One of the most
commonly used definitions of a recession is two consecutive
quarters of declining GNP.
   The 0.8 percent decline in the GNP from April to June of 1986
was followed by a 1 percent rise in the GNP in the third quarter
that year.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said it was not at all
unusual to have one or two isolated quarters of declining GNP
during long expansions. The current recovery from the 1981-82
recession has lasted a peacetime record of 68 months.
   ``We have not had a recession,'' Ortner said, when asked about
the decline in the spring of 1986. ``In an expansion, you get one
or two isolated down quarters which reflect isolated
circumstances.''
   Officials said the longest recovery on record, the 106-month
expansion from February 1961 to December 1969, which included the
Vietnam War buildup, had two negative quarters.
   The previous record-holder for peacetime expansions, the
58-month recovery from March 1975 to January 1980, had three
isolated quarters of declining GNP.

<HEAD>Chicago Rail Negotiations Halted, But Both Sides Still Willing to
Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Chicago & North Western
Railway and United Transportation Union have ended face-to-face
meetings, but they remain willing to talk if it will avert an Aug.
4 strike, the two sides said Wednesday.
   In an order preventing an earlier walkout, President Reagan said
a strike against C&NW would disrupt essential rail shipping in
several Midwest states and halt service for 40,000 Chicago-area
commuters.
   Two days of bargaining in the presence of federal mediators
ended Tuesday without a settlement, and the company said no new
sessions were planned.
   Chicago & North Western spokesman James Foote was quoted
Wednesday as saying the company would go ahead with plans to
eliminate the jobs of 1,156 brakemen next week and that the union
can strike.
   However, another spokesman said C&NW remains willing to
negotiate.
   ``We have left the door open for further talks if the union's
willing to come and sit down,'' North Western's Fred Bloedorn said.
``But if there's no hint that there's going to be any place to
negotiate, there's no sense in meeting for nothing.''
   UTU President Fred Hardin, meanwhile, said his union would
return to the bargaining table whenever the company wants to talk.
   ``We're perfectly willing to negotiate and attempt to resolve
it,'' Hardin said. ``But the carrier seems determined to
precipitate a strike.''
   Chicago & North Western wants to eliminate the jobs of 1,156 of
its 2,600 unionized brakemen, changing the makeup of most train
crews from an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only an
engineer and conductor.
   The nation's eighth-largest rail carrier said it could save $51
million a year and become more competitive if it made the cuts, but
the union said the action would compromise safety and violate its
contract.
   UTU members threatened to walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4
if the company makes the cuts.
   An emergency board appointed by the president in April to
intervene in the dispute issued a report July 1 proposing the
layoff of 689 brakemen, cuttng one brakeman per train in most cases
and both brakemen when approved by an arbitrator on a
train-by-train basis.
   Both sides rejected the report, the union calling it too
sweeping and the company saying it didn't go far enough.
   Union and company bargainers had broken off negotiations on
March 22 but resumed talks Monday under the supervision of the
National Mediation Board.
   ``If either party refuses to meet, there's not much we can do
about it,'' said Charles R. Barnes, executive director of the
federal agency.

<HEAD>Jackson Meets Democratic Chief Paul Kirk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson met briefly Wednesday with
Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk to discuss
Jackson's role in campaigning for the party's presidential and
local candidates, but neither side would give details on what was
discussed.
   ``It's part of a series of meetings to ensure ongoing
communication with all parts of the party and to make certain
everyone gets involved,'' DNC spokeswoman Julie Anbender said in a
telephone interview from the organization's Washington headquarters.
   Jackson spokesman Eric Easter confirmed the Chicago meeting, but
said Jackson would have no immediate comment on what he and Kirk
talked about.
   Easter also said discussions were continuing on extended Secret
Service protection for Jackson, even though he is no longer a
candidate for president. Jackson's staff made the request earlier
this week, citing his high visibility and continuing threats made
against his life.
   Secret Service spokesman Bill Corbett said Jackson has the
agency's protection while the matter remains under review.
Normally, such protection is discontinued ``at an appropriate,
convenient time,'' determined by the circumstances, Corbett said.
   Officials from the Dukakis camp and the DNC have indicated much
of the cost of Jackson's continuing political activities probably
would be shouldered by the DNC under its speakers program.
   On the campaign trail, Jackson expects to appear with Dukakis
and campaign for other office-seekers as well _ ``from the top to
the bottom,'' said Watkins.
   Jackson's re-emergence after this week's down time begins with
an appearance at Operation PUSH, the civil rights organization, on
Saturday, followed by the American Postal Workers in Chicago and
AME Zion conference in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday, and the Urban
League in Detroit next Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury indicted 23 people Wednesday
on charges they took part in an operation that may have shipped
hundreds of tons of highly potent marijuana to the United States
for years.
   The indictments stemmed from the U.S. Coast Guard's seizure last
month of 72 tons of pot _ worth an estimated $280 million _ from a
ship off the Washington coast. The ship was from Southeast Asia.
   Among those charged in the 10-count indictment was Brian Peter
Daniels, a New Yorker living in Bangkok, Thailand, who was
identified as the organizer of the operation.
   Daniels, 42, who was arrested Monday in Switzerland, was ``one
of the major suppliers of marijuana to the United States,'' said
Gary Liming, agent-in-charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration office in Seattle.
   Daniels was charged with conducting a continuing criminal
enterprise, the most serious of federal drug crimes, as well as
conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana.
   Also indicted was the 18-member crew aboard the Encounter Bay
when it was seized June 30 about 500 miles off the Washington
coast. Four others not on the ship also were charged.
   Among crew members indicted was Samuel Colflesh, the master of
the Encounter Bay. His twin brother, Robert, also was charged and
remains at large. Both were originally from Pennsylvania and have
been living in Bangkok.
   All were charged with possession with intent to distribute more
than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana and with conspiring to import a
like amount of the illegal plant into the United States.
   U.S. Attorney Gene Anderson and Liming said the indictment ends
a four-year effort to break up Daniels' alleged operation.
   Anderson and Liming said in a statement that agents posing as
fisherman brought about last month's bust.
   The high-grade Thai marijuana aboard Encounter Bay passed
through Thailand, Laos and Vietnam before the Coast Guard seized
the drugs on June 30, court documents say.
   Papers filed in U.S. District Court said Daniels and five other
men met May 5 in a Hong Kong hotel room to plan a shipment aboard
the converted oil rig supply ship.
   Two of the men were Larry Brant and Helmut Witt, undercover
agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration, who posed as
fishermen willing to use their boats to unload marijuana off the
Washington coast for a cut of the profits. They were introduced by
mutual associates, the court documents said.
   The agents said the others at the meeting included the Colflesh
brothers and Michael Forwell, an Australian who the agents said
established a Hong Kong company called Trademax to hire a crew,
launder money and handle other arrangements.
   The DEA concluded that Daniels would supply the marijuana,
affidavits said. He was known to the DEA as a major supplier of
Thai marijuana since the early 1980s, and agency files listed him
as the head of a marijuana growing operation in Thailand, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported Wednesday.
   Brant and Witt said that in April they were shown a vessel in
Hong Kong. The agents were told it was similar to the one that
would transport the marijuana, court documents revealed. The DEA
was able to learn the vessel to be used in the operation was the
Encounter Bay, which left Singapore June 2, according to the ship's
log.
   The marijuana was loaded onto the Encounter Bay from Daniels'
vessel, the Meridian, in the South China Sea, off Da Nang, Vietnam,
about June 10, according to court documents.
   Vietnamese soldiers were involved in the loading operation, a
Coast Guard officer testified during a July 13 court hearing in
Seattle.
   A Coast Guard C-130 airplane and the cutter Boutwell were sent
into international waters to intercept the Encounter Bay on June 30.

   Maestro Leonard Bernstein, back this week before
Soviet audiences for the first time in 29 years, led an
international youth orchestra in an evening concert Wednesday
before 4,000 Muscovites at Gorky Park.
   The Soviets, who sat packed together at the outdoor Green
Theater near the banks of the Moscow River, gave the American
director, composer and musician a standing ovation that lasted for
more than 10 minutes at the program's end.
   The gray-maned Bernstein, who wore a white sweatshirt despite
the evening heat, finally silenced the applause by pointing to his
wrist, then clasping his hands to form a pillow, miming that it was
late and time for him to sleep.
   Bernstein, who will turn 70 next month, led the 120-member
Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival Orchestra in Soviet composer
Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1, and in his own work titled
``Songfest.''
   Bernstein wielded the baton with his customary brio, punching
the air with his fist to show when piano chords should sound,
swaying from side to side during a lyrical string passage and
waving his left hand to coax more volume out of the young
musicians, whose average age is 23.
   The concert was his second in Moscow with the orchestra, which
includes musicians from 20 countries. He led the group at
Tchaikovsky Hall on Tuesday. The ensemble will also play on
Thursday in the Mirror Hall of Hermitage Park.
   Bernstein, whose compositions include the stage musical ``West
Side Story,'' told reporters he hopes the performances will
increase world understanding, as well as promote changes launched
under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party chief and Soviet
leader.
   ``I admire infinitely more Mr. Gorbachev than I do George Bush
(the U.S. vice president and Republican presidential candidate),
from a point of view of statesmanship,'' he told a news conference
held at the Ministry of Culture..
   ``I hope in whatever small way we can to increase feelings of
friendship and love between peoples of different cultures,
backgrounds and political systems, and to encourage as much as
possible the progressive movements taking place in this country as
I work for them in my country.''
   Proceeds from the concerts are being paid to the Soviet Cultural
Fund and the Lenin Children's Fund, according to concert organizers
and Culture Ministry officials. Tickets for Wednesday's performance
cost $5.
   Bernstein first visited the Soviet Union to conduct in 1959,
during the cultural ``thaw'' promoted by Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev.

   The House on Wednesday passed a ``dire
emergency'' supplemental appropriations bill that would pump $264.4
million into a variety of programs running out of money in the
closing days of fiscal 1988.
   Sent to the Senate by a 357-54 vote, the legislation would
provide money to programs ranging from drug interdiction efforts by
the Coast Guard to repairing U.S. prison facilities damaged by
rebellious Cuban prisoners.
   The bill carries the title ``Dire Emergency Supplemental
Appropriation'' for the year ending Sept. 30. Rep. Silvio Conte,
R-Mass., said he's never seen the word ``dire'' used this way in
his 30 years on the Appropriations Committee.
   Other programs in line for cash tranfusions include black lung
disease benefits for former coal miners; Small Business
Administration disaster assistance; flood disaster assistance;
drought relief administration; and aid for African refugees and
Armenian and Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union.
   The bill provides for $133.7 million in new budget authority and
for $130.7 million in transfers from other accounts in the affected
agencies, according to Conte.

   First lady Nancy Reagan told an evangelism
meeting Wednesday night that young people can do more to curb drug
abuse than ``all our drug agents and our police and our military
combined.''
   ``Because you're a threat to the drug culture, you have to
expect to be criticized, even ridiculed when you make your
anti-drug views known,'' Mrs. Reagan told the Student Congress on
Evangelism.
   ``I understand it's sometimes not easy, especially when you're
in high school,'' the first lady said in remarks prepared for
delivery. ``You may be told to mind your own business. You may be
called a do-gooder. You may be called up-tight.''
   ``In fact, you've already been called such things because you've
stood up for Christ,'' she said.
   ``When it comes to drugs, the reason for such put-downs is that
you're a danger. You're a danger to the drug attitudes that have
ruled this country for the past two decades.''
   She said young people who oppose illicit drug use should
persevere in their efforts to stop it.
   ``Young people have more power to stop drugs than all our drug
agents and our police and our military combined,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has conducted a ``just-say-no'' anti-drug abuse
campaign among America's youth for the past several years, was to
receive a special ``Youth for Christ'' award at the event.

   Striking scriptwriters returned to picket
lines Wednesday after a marathon bargaining session failed to
resolve differences between writers and producers that have hobbled
most Hollywood production.
   Meanwhile, the writers' bargaining position appeared to be
strengthened when a group of dissident writers announced they would
not break away from the union, as they had threatened.
   A federal mediator called off talks between negotiators for the
Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers Tuesday morning after a 20-hour session failed
to settle the dispute, now in its 21st week. New talks are expected
to be announced soon.
   The latest talks, which began on Saturday, were conducted under
a news blackout and details of the negotiations have been limited.
   More than 1,500 members of the Writers Guild picketed at Warner
Bros. and Columbia studios and at the offices of television
producer Aaron Spelling, said WGA spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   Pickets drew encouragement from Tuesday night's announcement by
a splinter group called the Writers Coalition that they would not
resign from the guild. The coalition said it will support the
bargaining process until ``it is either successfully concluded or
proves barren.''
   The group had been widely blamed for splitting the guild in a
1985 strike and union members had expressed fears that any
resignations now would weaken their bargaining stance.
   ``It's a victory for guild solidarity,'' Daniel Petrie Jr.,
author of ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``The Big Easy'' and an
outspoken critic of the coalition, said while picketing outside
Warner Bros. and Columbia. ``It will make the negotiating process a
lot cleaner.''
   ``Twilight Zone'' and ``Star Trek'' writer Harlan Ellison said,
``There is total solidarity. It's like the old days of organizing
the auto plants.''
   Neal Marshall, a member of the Writers Coalition, refused to
comment Wednesday about the strike and the coalition's change of
heart.
   In a further show of guild unity, more than 150 leading writers
took out advertisements in entertainment industry newspapers
Wednesday supporting the guild's bargaining position.
   ``The Writers Coalition claims to represent the lion's share of
`working' writers,'' the advertisement reads. ``This claim is both
offensively elitist and patently untrue.''
   The statement was signed by Billy Wilder (``Sunset Boulevard''),
William Goldman (``All the President's Men''), Glen and Les Charles
(``Cheers'') and Gary David Goldberg (``Family Ties.'')
   The writers and producers remained divided mainly on payments
for reruns of one-hour shows rebroadcast domestically and all
programs rebroadcast overseas.
   The strike continues to result in layoffs throughout the
entertainment industry. MGM and United Artists studios notified
numerous producers this week that their ``services had been
terminated.''
   ``It is with regret that we notify you that due to such strike
we are hereby terminating (the company's) services,'' the letters
said, citing the extenuating circumstances clause in their
contracts.

<HEAD>NBC-Journal Poll Finds 18-Point Dukakis Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The well-received Democratic National Convention
boosted Michael Dukakis to his biggest lead of the presidential
campaign, 18 points over Vice President George Bush, in a poll
released Wednesday.
   Dukakis drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for Bush in the
NBC News-Wall Street Journal national survey of 1,770 registered
voters. Dukakis had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention
NBC-Journal poll.
   The national nominating conventions often provide candidates a
boost in the polls, especially when the conventions proceed as
harmoniously as the Democrats' did last week. The bounce usually
settles as the race proceeds.
   Other recent surveys have found the jump in Dukakis' support.
Two Gallup polls done after the convention had the Massachusetts
governor ahead by 17 points, and he led by 10 points in one poll
and by 12 in another conducted during the convention.
   The NBC-Journal poll found women providing a major component of
Dukakis' support, a continuation of the ``gender gap'' suffered by
Bush. Dukakis led by 30 points among women, 54-24, compared to a
six-point lead among men.
   The poll also found that two-thirds of the Democrats who bolted
the party to vote for President Reagan said they would come back
and vote for Dukakis over Bush. And it said 71 percent of
respondents, and 52 percent of blacks, believed Dukakis had treated
Jesse Jackson fairly at the convention.
   The survey was conducted by telephone Saturday through Monday
among a random sample of adult Americans. It had a margin of error
of three points.

<HEAD>Navy Finds No Major Problems With Training Following Recruit's
Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the wake of the drowning death of a
recruit, the Navy has reviewed its training programs and concluded
that there were no major problems, a top service official said
Wednesday.
   ``The results of the review indicated that there were problems,
but they were not severe and, with few exceptions, training was
being conducted in a safe and proper manner,'' said Vice Adm. Nils
R. Thunman, chief of the Navy's education and training branch.
   ``We found no major systemic problems,'' he told a House Armed
Services subcommittee. ``Other than the Rescue Swimmer School,
there were no training areas in which the cumulative effects of
improper supervision, incorrect practices and poor administration
were degrading the safety of training.''
   The review was conducted after the March 2 death of a
19-year-old recruit at the Rescue Swimmer School at Pensacola, Fla.
   Five enlisted Navy instructors have been charged in the case,
including one who was charged with involuntary manslaughter. The
other four were charged with conspiracy to commit battery.
   The recruit, Lee Mirecki, died after he panicked, climbed out of
a pool, shouted that he was quitting and then had his head held
under water.
   Thunman said the Navy trains 80,000 officer and enlisted
students daily in 3,200 different courses at 29 bases. All of them
were reviewed in the wake of the Mirecki case to make sure they
were safe, he told the military personnel subcommittee.
   Some training rules have been changed. For example, Thunman
said, students will have the opportunity in course critiques to
comment on training practices they thought were unsafe and whether
the instructors were sensitive to safety issues.
   In addition, instructors will be evaluated on whether they
maintain safe practices, he said.
   A top Pentagon official told the subcommittee that the Defense
Department has a good safety record, ``considering the dangerous
nature of much of military training and the large number of
personnel trained.''
   But the Pentagon is still trying to improve its record, said
Marine Lt. Gen. Anthony Lukeman, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for manpower.

<HEAD>Newspaper Comes Back Punching After 15 Days Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's only opposition
newspaper, La Prensa, returned to print Wednesday counter-punching
after its 15-day shutdown by the government.
   The newspaper's Wednesday edition accused the leftist Sandinista
government of violating the Central American peace plan known in
the region as Esquipulas II. It ran a special section with a banner
headline saying: ``Five Simultaneous Blows To Esquipulas II.''
   The government ordered closure of the 60-year-old newspaper on
July 11, the day after a large opposition rally in the southern
city of Nandaime ended in violence between Sandinista police and
demonstrators. About 40 protesters were arrested.
   The government accused La Prensa of reporting falsely on the
protest and of ``inciting violence, disorder and disrespect for
authorities.''
   La Prensa denied any wrongdoing.
   The newspaper countered Wednesday that the government had dealt
several recent ``blows'' to the regional peace plan. It cited its
own suspension, the actions of police at Nandaime, the expulsion of
U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven American diplomats accused
of backing a plan to destabilize the Sandinista government, and the
expropriation of Nicaragua's largest private surgar mill.
   At the same time the government closed La Prensa, it also took
off the air for an undetermined time the Roman Catholic radio
station, Radio Catolica, as well as a private news show on the
Radio Noticias station.
   On Sunday, the Interior Ministry announced a 48-hour suspension
of a news broadcast by the staunchly anti-government Superior
Private Enterprise Council. A ministry statement said the program
``transmitted false news,'' but it did not elaborate.
   The Sandinistas maintained strict media censorship from 1982
until last January, when a state of emergency was lifted.
   La Prensa was shut down for 15 months on June 26, 1986, a day
after the U.S. Congress approved $100 million in aid for the Contra
rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   Radio Catolica was closed for almost two years for failing to
broadcast President Daniel Ortega's year-end address on Dec. 31,
1985.
   They both were allowed to reopen last October under the regional
peace plan signed Aug. 7, 1987 by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala.

Meese's ethics</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Government Ethics said Wednesday
it has launched an analysis of Attorney General Edwin Meese III's
activities in the wake of an 814-page report stemming from a
criminal investigation of the attorney general.
   OGE Director Frank Nebeker said the analysis is under way and
that the office will respond to a request from Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., for the results of the ethics office's study.
   The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
is conducting a separate ethics inquiry of Meese, based on the
department's standards of conduct for employees.
   Nebeker said he is reviewing the lengthy report on Meese by
independent counsel James McKay, reports by Levin's subcommittee on
oversight of government management and Tuesday's testimony by
former deputy attorney general Arnold Burns and ex-criminal
division chief William Weld.
   He is reviewing all these sources ``with a view toward
determining whether there existed any violation'' of a 1965
executive order or model standards of conduct issued by the ethics
office, said Nebeker.
   Nebeker's comments came following a request from Levin, who said
he wants the ethics office to launch an inquiry of Meese's
acceptance of benefits from longtime friend E. Robert Wallach.
   Meese's actions at Wallach's request on behalf of Wedtech Corp.
and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project may have violated a
1965 executive order detailing standards of ethical conduct for
government officers, Levin said in a letter to Nebeker.
   Those standards prohibit an official from taking anything of
value from someone who is seeking to obtain business with the
official's agency. The standards also direct federal employees to
avoid conduct which might create the appearance of using public
office for private gain or giving preferential treatment to someone
or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the
integrity of government.
   Levin's request follows the report on the attorney general
issued July 18 by McKay, who decided not to seek an indictment of
Meese, even though McKay concluded he probably broke two tax laws
and twice violated a federal conflict-of-interest statute.
   McKay found no basis for action in connection with Meese's
involvement with Wedtech, the Iraqi oil pipeline project or his
dealings with financial manager W. Franklyn Chinn, to whom Meese
was steered by Wallach.
   Chinn turned a $40,000 profit for Meese on a $55,000 investment
in just 18 months. McKay reached no conclusions on Meese's ethical
behavior.
   McKay said that among the benefits Meese received from Wallach
were arranging two loans for him, arranging for Chinn to be Meese's
financial manager and helping to arrange a $40,000-a-year job for
Meese's wife, Ursula.
   In an appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
William Weld, former head of the Justice Department's criminal
division, said he concluded before resigning in protest March 29
that Meese's conduct gave the appearance of partiality to Wallach
and constituted the use of Meese's public office for private gain.
   Weld said he told Meese that the attorney general probably also
had violated the federal gratuities law. He said that if Meese were
an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for
taking gratuities from Wallach, who is a San Francisco attorney and
longtime friend of Meese.
   In his letter to Nebeker, Levin said, ``Although Mr. Meese has
announced his intention to leave office in the next month, a
determination of the relevant ethics issues remains important,
particularly because of the visibility of this case and Mr. Meese's
continued strong denial of any impropriety on his part.''
   ``Without a public finding on these issues, questions will
remain as to whether such conduct was in accordance with the
standards of conduct applicable to all federal employees,'' Levin
added.
   In response, Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said
Levin ``does know how to beat a dead horse.'' Korten said it is
``supremely ironic'' that Levin, who played a key role in enacting
legislation re-authorizing independent counsels, ``should be so
unwilling to accept an independent counsel's findings as final.''
   The Office of Professional Responsibility is using McKay's
report as a basis.
   OPR counsel Michael Shaheen has not yet decided precisely what
areas to focus on in regard to Meese's activities, according to
government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to the inquiry by OPR and the analysis by the ethics
office, the state bar of California has requested a copy of McKay's
report to review Meese's conduct. Meese is licensed to practice law
in California.
   OPR can recommend a range of actions against a federal employee,
including dismissal, but Meese is leaving government next month to
join the conservative Heritage Foundation.

   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee on Wednesday unanimously approved and sent to the floor
the nomination of Elizabeth Moler, a 12-year veteran of the
committee staff, for a seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
   If confirmed, she would succeed Charles Stalon, whose four-year
term expired last October.
   Stalon has been nominated for a year remaining on another term,
but some committee members have said the seat should go to an oil
and gas producing state. Stalon is from Illinois.
   The committee took no action on Stalon's nomination or that of
the chairman, Martha Hesse, another holdover member.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said during the proceedings,
``There's been a request to hold up Hesse.'' He gave no further
details.
   Her nomination for a full term has been pending before the
committee for a year.

   Police arrested about 30 students who
held a demonstration outside U.S. Army headquarters Wednesday
demanding expulsion of U.S. troops and marking the 35th anniversary
of the Korean war's end.
   Students yelled ``Yankee go home!'' and tried to stage a
peaceful sit-down protest at U.S. 8th Army headquarters in southern
Seoul, but hundreds of riot officers forced them into police buses.
   At the National Assembly, officials said the legislators were
ready to accept a request from communist North Korea for talks on a
non-aggression pact and the North's possible participation in the
Olympic Games in September. The war began in 1950 when the North
invaded South Korea.
   About 2,000 radical students and dissidents rallied later in the
day at Korea University, then half the crowd marched to the U.S.
Embassy.
   Thousands of riot police followed the march, blocked the way
less than a mile from the embassy and persuaded the protesters to
move into a nearby park, where they dispersed voluntarily.
   ``Down with the United States, which forced partition of the
Korean peninsula!'' protesters shouted, demanding the withdrawal of
42,000 American soldiers based here under a defense treaty.
   The United States and 15 other nations intervened on South
Korea's side during the war and China supported North Korea. The
war ended in a stalemate and armistice July 27, 1953, but the two
Koreas remain technically at war because no treaty has been signed.
   Radical students say the United States is responsible for the
peninsula's continued division and claim it treats the South as a
colony. They have called for immediate reunification, but have
little public support.
   Assembly officials said representatives of the top four
political parties and Speaker Kim Chae-sun agreed to accept the
North Korean offer and the agreement would be conveyed to
Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, on Aug. 1 after party leaders
give formal approval.
   Lawmakers added, however, that they want preliminary talks at
the Panmunjom border truce village to work out preliminary details
for negotiations. They recommended a meeting in the second week of
August.
   ``The South is ready to take up the Olympic issue and does not
want to limit the agenda,'' one aide said.
   North Korea has indicated it does not want preliminary talks.
South Korean media reports earlier this week said North Korea
considered them a waste of time.
   The North Koreans sent a proposal to the South last week calling
for talks between their legislatures on a non-aggression pact and
suggested the first round be held in Pyongyang.
   In a second letter Tuesday, the North said it also was ready to
discuss entering the Olympics in Seoul on condition its demand to
be co-host was discussed.
   South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have refused
to let the North be co-host because the Games are awarded to a
single city. The North has said it will boycott the Games.
   Three previous rounds of talks on easing tension and
establishing relations ended in failure. The North ended the most
recent series in 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Adopts Amendment Which Could Move U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate adopted an amendment Wednesday
which would allow the United States to move its embassy in Israel
to Jerusalem despite the international controversy over such a step.
   The amendment, proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was
incorporated into a $15 billion appropriations bill adopted by the
Senate for the 1989 funding of the State, Justice and Commerce
departments.
   Helms' provision authorizes funds for building two diplomatic
facilities in Israel, provided that each one ``equally preserves
the ability of the United States to locate its ambassador or its
consul general at that site.''
   The Helms amendment also would not allow the administration to
designate either building as the new embassy until construction of
one is near completion. The amendment does not give a dollar figure
for the construction project.
   The U.S. Embassy, along with nearly all the other foreign
missions in Israel, currently is located in Tel Aviv even though
Israel considers Jerusalem its capital. The United States has a
consulate in Jewish West Jerusalem and another in the predominantly
Arab East Jerusalem.
   U.S. policy over more than two decades has been to leave the
embassy in Tel Aviv as long as the status of Jerusalem has not been
resolved by international arbitration. Especially contentious is
the question of Israel's 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, which
it captured from Jordan in what is known as the Six-Day War.
   The question of the embassy's location is a very emotional one
for Moslems around the world, who consider Jerusalem as one of
their most venerated shrines. The State Department, unwilling to
offend the Moslem world, has fought to keep the embassy from moving
there.
   The issue has periodically come up during U.S. election
campaigns, serving as a litmus test for a candidate's support of
Israel.
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate this year, said in an
interview recently that he would favor locating the embassy in
Jerusalem because that is the city Israel considers its capital.
   Helms, who wants the embassy moved, said in floor debate on his
proposal that because both new facilities will be ``equally capable
of serving as our embassy, subsequent presidents will be able to
select which site should serve as the U.S. Embassy.''
   For the past three years Helms has blocked the State
Department's request to build a new embassy in Tel Aviv and a new
consulate in Jerusalem. The current buildings are old and crowded.
   The bill now goes to a joint House-Senate conference committee
to iron out differences.

   American Samoa's delegate to the House of
Representatives and his administrative assistant conspired to
defraud the government of more than $130,000 by putting ghost
employees on their congressional payroll, the U.S. attorney's
office announced Wednesday.
   An eight-page information filed in conjunction with a plea
agreement reached with the two defendants said Fofo I.F. Sunia and
his aide used the money they obtained from the scheme to entertain
constituents, pay election campaign expenses and make house and car
loan payments.
   The document filed in U.S. District Court said that from
February 1983 to August 1986 Sunia and assistant Matthew K. Iuli
falsely certified to the House finance office that people living in
American Samoa and elsewhere were employed in Sunia's Washington
congressional office.
   The ghost employees weren't even aware their names were listed
as congressional employees, said the office of U.S. Attorney Jay
Stephens. Stephens' office said in a statement that Sunia and Iuli
will appear in court to enter guilty pleas ``in the very near
future.''
   Albert Comeaux, Sunia's press secretary, said the delegate is
out of town and referred all calls to his attorney, Earl Silbert,
who was not immediately available for comment, his secretary said.
   Sunia's assistant forged endorsements of paychecks issued for
the ghost employees and deposited the money in his own bank account
and in Sunia's election campaign account.
   The first count of the information said Sunia and Iuli conspired
to defraud the United States of more than $130,000, a crime
punishable with up to five years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
   The second count said Iuli submitted a false payroll document as
part of the fraud scheme in violation of a federal law prohibiting
false statements, a crime that carries up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
   The case stemmed from an investigation by the Washington field
office of the Secret Service and the U.S. attorney's office.
   According to the information filed in court, documents including
payroll information and oath of office forms were prepared, forged
and submitted to the office of finance so that payroll checks would
be issued in the names of each of the people named on the forms.
   For some of Sunia's congressional employees who terminated their
employment, Sunia and Iuli delayed officially notifying the finance
office of their termination without the knowledge of the employees
in order to generate additional payroll checks which were then
taken by Iuli.
   The checks were forged by Iuli and proceeds were deposited to
the personal accounts of Iuli, the ``Committee to Elect Fofo''
election campaign account, forwarded unendorsed to Samoa Tours in
Pago Pago in American Samoa or presented in American Samoa for cash.
   Some 78 U.S. Treasury checks totalling $130,920.50 for 14 ghost
employees were wrongfully used by Sunia and Iuli during the
conspiracy, said the information.
   The funds were administered by Iuli and paid hotel and meal
expenses of visiting constituents and staff members, election
campaign expenses and furnished air travel for Sunia and members of
his family.
   On a monthly basis, Iuli falsely certified on payroll
certification forms submitted to the finance office that the
employees had performed their assigned official duties.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Says Its Pilots May Take Stimulants On Long Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Air Force pilots sometimes
take drugs to help them stay awake on long flights, the Air Force
said Wednesday. A rash of accidents have caused worry about the
safety of low-level training flights.
   The Air Force was responding to a report on West German
television. Tuesday night's broadcast, by ARD television network,
said U.S. Air Force pilots assigned to West Germany take the drug
dextroamphetamine Dexedrine to increase their alertness while in
flight.
   ARD quoted an unidentified a U.S. military officer as saying Air
Force pilots routinely use Dexedrine.
   Pilots use the drug ``so that they are able to fly when they
haven't gotten enough sleep or don't feel fit enough,'' ARD quoted
the officer as saying.
   The ARD report also said pilots then take the sedative Seconal
at night to counteract the effects of Dexedrine.
   However, in an official statement from its headquarters in
Ramstein, the Air Force stated ``categorically'' that its ``pilots
do not take medication for normal, day-to-day training flights.''
   U.S. Air Force jet fighters sweeping over West Germany are a
common sight while they practice low-level missions in designated
areas.
   Worries grew after five F-16 fighter jets crashed in West
Germany within three months this year.
   On June 29, three U.S. Air Force F-16s crashed in two accidents
in West Germany. One pilot was killed when two of the jets collided
in the air.
   On March 31, another Air Force F-16 crash in the town of Forst,
killing the pilot and a person on the ground. The accident came one
day after a French Mirage jet fighter crashed in southern Bavaria
near a nuclear power plant.
   On April 18, a pilot was slightly injured when he ejected from
his U.S. Air Force F-16 as it crashed near the Luxembourg border.
   The Air Force statement said: ``The use of stimulant and
sedative medications is limited by regulation to flights in which
the length or precise schedule of the mission presents a
significant risk of flight safety due to fatigue.''
   ``Dexedrine and Seconal use almost exclusively involves solo
flights to or from the United States and overseas bases,'' it said.
   Lt. Col. Ed Neunherz, the chief spokesman at Ramstein,
emphasized that a pilot would only use the sedative ``once he's
back on the ground.''
   ``He could take it after he's landed to help get his body clock
back in order,'' Neunherz told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview.
   He said a pilot would only take Dexedrine if he felt fatigue
during a long mission.
   ``Routine use of these medications is never advised. They are to
be used only in the event that an air crew member feels fatigue may
jeopardize flight safety if the medications are not used,'' the Air
Force's written statement said.
   ``In most instances, the prescribed medication is not taken by

<HEAD>Restaging of Pageant Brings Complaints of Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaints that the 1988 Miss
District of Columbia pageant was unfair prompted contest officials
to restage the event and now contestants say the second go-round
smacks of racism.
   Edwina Richard was named the winner on June 24, but when
contestants started grumbling to national pageant officials about
the judging process, the slate was scratched and the entire affair
was repeated on Saturday, said Leonard Horn, chairman of the Miss
America Pageant.
   Noreen Patricia Morrin _ originally the fourth runner-up _
walked away the winner on Saturday. Miss Richard became first
runner-up. Two of the original 13 contestants did not return, Horn
said Wednesday.
   Miss Richard said she was ``embarrassed'' and ``humiliated'' by
the incident.
   ``I'd like to be the one to go to Atlantic City because I won
the first pageant fair and square,'' she said, ``and there was bias
and unfairness in the second.''
   She told The Washington Times that she plans to sue the Miss
America Pageant.
   The second contest prompted allegations of racism, since Miss
Richard is black and Miss Morrin is white. The panel of judges in
the first pageant was predominantly black, as is the population of
the District of Columbia, while the second panel was mostly white.
   Horn defended the decision to hold a second pageant.
   ``It was not an easy decision to make. It's not an easy thing to
tell a girl who won that she has to try again,'' he said.
   ``But the girls were the ones up in arms,'' he said. ``Within 24
hours of the original pageant, we started receiving complaints from
some of the contestants, who ultimately banded together and
complained the pageant was not held fairly.''
   An investigation by national pageant officials revealed that at
least one of the original judges knew several contestants, Horn
said.
   ``We learned that one judge was on the faculty of a school where
at least two contestants were students, and knew the contestants or
at least knew of them,'' he said.
   ``The foundation of our system is that none of the judges knows
anything about the contestants,'' he said. ``The only thing they
should see are the four competitions,'' which include the talent,
evening gown and swimsuit portions and a personal interview.
   Further investigation revealed that the director of the Miss
District of Columbia pageant, in his first year as head of the
event, selected the head of the judge's committee to serve as a
judge, replacing one who canceled.
   ``That's also an infraction, because that committee head sees
the young ladies in rehearsal and in circumstances other than in
competition,'' Horn said.
   ``The young ladies were unhappy and knew it was not fair,'' he
said.
   The only option was to rehold the pageant, Horn said, using
judges selected by the national pageant office.
   The director of the Miss District of Columbia pageant, Nathan
Lewis, has ``been advised to cease and desist from any further
activities, and we are looking for a new franchise owner,'' Horn
said.
   ``We're not impugning his integrity and we're not suggesting
improper motives,'' he said, ``but in his zeal to run the pageant,
he made serious errors.''

<HEAD>Arias Says Peace Plan Still Valid Despite Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias said Wednesday that although the nations of Central America
have failed to fulfil all their obligations under a regional peace
plan, ``We cannot lose faith.''
   Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for the plan that he
originated, singled out Nicaragua in particular for criticism
during a brief news conference.
   He said the main objective of his five-hour visit to El Salvador
was to show his affection for and solidarity with ``a very dear
friend,'' President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Duarte has terminal liver cancer. His doctors give him between
six and 18 months to live.
   ``I am certain that when the history of the decade of the 1980s
in Central America is written ... the predominant role could not be
denied Napoleon Duarte for his consolidation of democracy and
liberty here in El Salvador,'' said Arias.
   Duarte sat at Arias' side, but took no questions.
   Most of Arias' comments concerned the regional peace plan known
as Esquipulas II that he, Duarte and the presidents of Nicaragua,
Honduras and Guatemala signed in Esquipulas, Guatemala on Aug. 7,
1987.
   Arias said there ``has been progress and there has been
backsliding'' over the last 12 months.
   But he said, ``We cannot lose faith in Esquipulas. If the will
existed to reach accords last Aug. 7, today the world demands that
the same will exist to carry out what we committed ourselves to.''
   The plan called for dialogue between government and insurgents
in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, and for political
amnesties and greater democracy in the region.
   ``If we weigh the plan, on balance what we have achieved is more
positive than negative ...,'' Arias said. ``We're not completely
satisfied. None of the Central American countries has been able to
fulfill all its obligations.''
   The accord helped ease hostilities between the leftist
Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, but had
almost no effect on the Salvadoran and Guatemalan civil wars.
   The five presidents tentatively planned to meet on Aug. 7, the
first anniversary of the peace plan.
   Duarte, who is to leave Aug. 1 for a week of treatment in
Washington, and President Jose Azcona of Honduras said recently no
plans for a summit exist. Arias said Wednesday a summit is
``pending'' but with no date, place or agenda as yet.
   Arias said regarding Nicaragua:
   ``Lately, the backsliding that has caused me the most pain is
seeing the closure of La Prensa and Radio Catolica in Managua, the
jailing of demonstrators for merely wanting to freely express their
opinions.''
   Nicaraguan police reacted with violence to a big opposition
rally July 10. The government later closed La Prensa, the only
opposition newspaper, and muzzled several broadcast outlets.
   La Prensa resumed publishing Wednesday after a 15-day suspension
but Radio Catolica, the Roman Catholic radio station, is still off
the air.
   Arias lamented that ``dogmatic and intransigent people''
dominated both sides of the Nicaraguan conflict.
   ``There are people in the Contras that don't want democracy
because they know that if there were democracy in Nicaragua, they'd
have to live their whole lives in Miami,'' he said.
   ``And there are people in the Sandinista government who don't
want democracy because they only know how to fire a machine gun,
because they find that a regime like that needs excuses, and they
find the excuses in military struggle ... excuses for not having
enough food, the poverty, the hunger, the misery.''
   Arias also chided U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz for
arranging to meet with only four of the five Central American
foreign ministers in Guatemala City on Aug. 1.
   ``If he would have asked my advice, I would have recommended the
inclusion of Nicaragua,'' Arias said. ``But he did not ask me.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Final Fiscal 1988 Money Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis put the final piece into a
budget-balancing puzzle before heading off Wednesday on a
presidential campaign swing.
   The $124 million bill closed the books on fiscal 1988, which
ended 27 days earlier. Dukakis signed the measure about 5 p.m.,
just before leaving his Statehouse office.
   Unlike the full-fledged news conference Dukakis held on July 17
to announce signing a scaled-down $11.6 billion state budget for
fiscal 1989, there was no fanfare to mark the governor's last act
in erasing a $400 million shortfall in fiscal 1988.
   The signing of the measure was announced by the governor's
Statehouse press office by title only in a list of 28 bills. Press
aides could not say specifically what it contained.
   The late action on the money bill was due to ``negotiations and
trying to make sure we didn't have a replay of what happened with
some of the vetoes that happened on (fiscal) 1989,'' said Michael
Lelyveld, spokesman for the Executive Office of Administration and
Finance.
   Those problems included the announcing of cuts for legislative
commissions and other programs which the governor later said would
be funded.
   Major spending in the fiscal 1988 deficiency bill included $37
million to help hospitals offset losses in federal Medicare funds,
$56 million for underfunded Medicaid accounts and $3.2 million for
underfunded Aid to Families with Dependent Children accounts.
   The hospital Medicare payments were added by the Legislature to
meet commitments under the new universal health care act. The $37
million Dukakis agreed upon was still $13 million less than the
act's full commitment of $50 million _ representing the largest
veto contained in the bill.
   Another controversial item vetoed by Dukakis would have
benefited Southwood Community Hospital in Norfolk. Hospital
officials said the continued operation of a newly opened substance
abuse center named for the governor's wife, Kitty, was threatened
if the hospital didn't get the $2 million to $3 million
appropriation.
   In his veto message, Dukakis said the ``current hospital
reimbursement system provides sufficient flexibility to address
Southwood's problems'' without having to give Southwood a special
appropriation.

<HEAD>Senate Approves $7.5 Million For TV Aimed At Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved spending $7.5
million to establish a U.S. government television service to beam
American news and entertainment programs to Cuba.
   TV Marti, which would supplement Radio Marti, would ``accelerate
the free flow of information to our friends in Cuba,'' said Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., sponsor of the measure.
   The money was earmarked in the 1989 budget of the U.S.
Information Agency, which was included in an appropriations bill
for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments and the judiciary
approved 80-16. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference
committee.
   The service would provide a variety of shows _ from news and
information to sitcoms and soap operas.
   The $7.5 million would cover the cost of setting up a TV studio,
recruiting and training staff and conducting a 90-day operating
test.
   The National Association of Broadcasters opposed the TV Marti
proposal because of the possibility of retaliatory jamming by Cuba
of American radio stations and potential interference to southern
Florida TV stations from the TV Marti signal itself.
   But the NAB applauded a provision in the bill that would hold up
funding for full operation of the service until the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee holds hearings and decides whether TV Marti
would violate international treaty obligations of the United States.

   Anti-Arab extremists increased armed patrols
Wednesday to protect Israeli travelers in Arab east Jerusalem.
Mayor Teddy Kollek said they were irresponsible and seeking
publicity.
   Two Palestinians were reported wounded by Israeli soldiers in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a rebellion against
Israeli occupation began Dec. 8. At least 234 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died in the uprising.
   A prominent supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization
called for recognition of Israel and direct negotiations with it,
echoing a new moderate position proposed recently by PLO spokesman
Bassam Abu Sharif.
   ``As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis, so I must
speak with them,'' said Faisal Husseini, head of the Arab Studies
Institute in east Jerusalem.
   He was held for nine months without charges after being arrested
last fall, and Defense Minister Yizhak Rabin once called him the
leading PLO representative in the occupied lands. Husseini
commented Wednesday in a public meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli
peace activists.
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it describes as
a terrorist organization, and PLO hardliners have denounced the Abu
Sharif proposal for negotiations.
   The extremists patrolling east Jerusalem are members of the Kach
movement, which is led by American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane and
advocates expelling all Arabs from Israeli-held lands. The patrols
began Sunday.
   On Wednesday, Kach members toured east Jerusalem in six white
vans identified by Hebrew signs reading ``escort vehicle.'' At
least one person armed with a rifle or pistol rode in each van, a
patrol coordinator said.
   Kollek said on Israel radio: ``I think they are absolutely
negative. They are absolutely irresponsible elements, and one has
to do everything to stop it.''
   The mayor, who has championed the city's unity throughout his
career, said police could handle security problems in east
Jerusalem, where Israeli buses often are stoned.
   He accused Kach followers of conducting the escorts to ``make
headlines.''
   Four Kach members and an Orthodox Jewish journalist who
accompanied the extremists were detained for questioning Wednesday,
but were later released, said police spokeswoman Nurit Bouton.
   ``There was a suspicion they would be provocative,'' Ms. Bouton
said. Israeli officials have said they can only stop the patrols if
Kach members carry unlicensed weapons or violate the law.
   ``The worst that can happen is that some of our guys get put in
jail for a few hours, and are then released,'' said Gadi Servetman,
a Kach activist who volunteered to participate in a patrol
Wednesday. ``We won't stop.''
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Khan Yunis, troops wounded a
16-year-old Arab when they opened fire to break up a demonstration,
the army said.
   The army accused the youth of instigating the demonstration.
   ``He stood in front of all his friends and called `Allahu
akhbar!' (God is great!),'' the army spokesman said.
   In the West Bank refugee camp of Dheishe near Bethlehem,
soldiers shot a 23-year-old Arab in the leg after residents stoned
Israeli cars on the highway passing the camp, hospital officials
said. The army said it was checking the report.
   Jerusalem police investigating last week's shooting death of a
15-year-old Jerusalem Arab said Wednesday he apparently was killed
by an Israeli soldier, Israel radio reported.
   Nidal Fuad Rabadi was the first Jerusalem resident to be killed
during the nearly 8-month-old Arab uprising, and his death July 19
caused riots in the disputed city.
   The investigation said the incident began when Arab youths
stoned an Israeli bus on the outskirts of Jerusalem. A settler and
two reserve soldiers got off the bus, and started chasing the
stone-throwers, the report said.
   The settler fired his pistol in the air, and the two soldiers
fired their rifles, the report said. The settler could not have
fired the fatal shot because he was too far from Rabadi, the radio
quoted investigators as saying.
   Rabadi's relatives have said he was not involved in
stone-throwing and was riding his bicycle when he was killed. Army
officials said without elaborating that military police would now
take up the investigation.

   Academy Award winning actress Cher's
boyfriend was arrested Wednesday for allegedly trying to hit a
photographer with his sports car.
   Robert Camilletti, 24, was arrested and booked for investigation
of felony assault with a deadly weapon shortly after the 11:30 a.m.
incident, said police spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon.
   ``He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of
speed,'' said free-lance photographer Peter Brandt, 35.
   Camilletti's attorney posted the $2,000 bail.
   There were no injuries, said Sgt. Bob Brounsten. Camilletti's
black Ferrari and Brandt's Honda Accord were damaged substantially,
he said.
   Brandt was taking photographs outside the couple's Benedict
Canyon home, he said.
   Cher was at home and was interviewed by police, but she told
them she didn't see what happened.
   Her manager had no comment.
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti have been companions since meeting at a
New York nightclub two years ago.
   Camilletti, a former bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, is
now pursuing an acting career. He recently completed shooting of
``Loverboy'' with Kate Jackson and Kirstie Alley.

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over much of the
central and eastern part of the nation again Wednesday but missed
most of the northern Plains, where temperatures soared to record
levels.
   Thunderstorms dumped up to 3 inches of rain on northwest
Louisiana, causing flooding in some areas.
   Rain also was heavy in western Pennsylvania and eastern New
England. Amity, Pa., received 2 inches of rain in the six hours
ended at 2 p.m. EDT and parts of Pittsburgh got 1\ inches, while
Boston got just under an inch. Flooding was reported in south
Boston and other parts of eastern Massachusetts.
   Showers and thunderstorms also hit parts of eastern Ohio, the
central Appalachian region, the central Gulf Coast and Florida.
Storms produced heavy rain, small hail and gusty winds at Polkton,
N.C.
   Parts of the lower Mississippi Valley, Oklahoma, the Texas
Panhandle and northeast Wisconsin also reported showers and
thunderstorms.
   Temperatures soared into triple digits in the northern Plains.
In North Dakota, Dickinson broke a record for the date with a
reading of 102 degrees and Jamestown hit 103, breaking the previous
record of 101 set in 1941. The airport at Duluth, Minn., also set a
record with a reading of 93 degrees.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 55 degrees at Crescent
City, Calif., to 105 degrees at Needles, Calif. The overnight low
was 42 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Thursday's forecast called for mainly dry weather, with showers
and thunderstorms predicted only for Florida, parts of the Georgia
coast, southeast New England and northern Arizona.
   Highs were predicted to be in the 70s and 80s from the lower
Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to the central Atlantic Coast and
into New England; and from western Montana to Washington, along
much of the Pacific Coast and in northern Arizona. Highs were
expected to be near 100 degrees in north-central Texas and up to
110 in the desert Southwest.
   Most other regions are expected to have highs in the 90s.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Dismisses United Europe As `Airy Fairy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, long accused of
an insular attitude toward the rest of Europe, on Wednesday
dismissed as ``airy-fairy'' suggestions for tighter political union
among European Economic Community nations.
   She also ruled out a central bank for the 12-nation trade bloc.
It was Mrs. Thatcher's most outspoken criticism yet of what she
regards as impractical overenthusiasm for some kind of United
States of Europe.
   ``They spend far too much time talking about these airy-fairy
ideas,'' Mrs. Thatcher told a radio interviewer who asked her about
proposals for a federal government for Western Europe.
   ``They say `Let's have European union.' I say `What do you mean,
because I can't see any of you dissolving your own countries into a
United States of Europe'.''
   She spoke on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Jimmy Young
Show,'' a mixture of chatty interviews and popular music aimed
mainly at housewives.
   Last week, the prime minister did not reappoint to the EEC
headquarters in Brussels a British commissioner, Lord Cockfield,
who was masterminding an alignment of sales taxes throughout the
trade bloc _ a move Mrs. Thatcher opposed.
   Aligning of taxes is part of preparations for 1992, when the EEC
is due to become a single market without trade barriers.
   Mrs. Thatcher replaced Cockfield with Leon Brittan.
   Brittan left her Cabinet in 1986 after siding with Mrs. Thatcher
in a dispute over a helicopter company, Westland, and then taking
the blame for leaking a confidential document.
   Critics charged that Mrs. Thatcher has repaid Brittan, 48, for
permanent exclusion from the Cabinet and also hoped for a more
amenable commissioner.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said Wednesday that
the prime minister sent Brittan to the EEC to ``get him out of the
way,'' but predicted Brittan would avenge his being fired from the
Cabinet by following Cockfield's line.
   Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, whom Mrs. Thatcher ousted as
Conservative Party leader in 1975, on Friday accused her of firing
Cockfield ``out of sheer spite.'' He called it a disgrace and a
public scandal.
   Thatcher aides denied Cockfield was dropped because he became
obsessed with EEC interests over British interests and pointed to
his age, 71.
   However, Brittan's appointment was widely seen as underlining
Mrs. Thatcher's differences with Britain's EEC partners on
continental Europe, while nurturing a special relationship with the
United States.
   Mrs. Thatcher argued Wednesday she is simply being practical
about the limits of European union.
   ``The whole history of the two places is entirely different,''
she said of comparisons between West European nations and the
United States of America.
   ``It is not possible to have a United States of Europe. What is
possible is for the 12 countries of Europe steadily to work more
closely together on things we do better together, so that we can
trade better together.''
   She said Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission
and the EEC's chief official, erred in predicting that within a
decade 80 percent of national decisions by member nations would be
taken on a Europe-wide basis.
   Mrs. Thatcher said no need existed for uniformity of sales taxes.
   As for an EEC central bank, she said, that would mean
surrendering ``fundamental economic decisions to another country .
.. That I will not do.''
   Opinion polls show British voters are less enthusiastic about
closer ties within the EEC than, say, the West Germans or the
French.

   A welfare mother of five has been promised a job
and a home in a middle-class neighborhood from a millionaire who
says he just wanted to help real people.
   ``I can't believe this is happening to me,'' said 28-year-old
Anita Hunter. ``It's just a miracle from God. I've struggled and
hoped for so long to get my children out of this neighborhood and
into a safe environment.''
   Businessman James Gisclair said he plans to buy a house for Ms.
Hunter and her family and give her a college education, a job, a
car and someone to care for her children, who range in age from one
month to 10 years.
   ``The idea is to get Anita to become self-sufficient to the
point where she can pay her own rent on the house, pay her own
bills and do everything on her own someday,'' Gisclair told The
Miami News in an interview published Wednesday. ``I plan to pay for
everything until she reaches that point.''
   He also wants Ms. Hunter's month-old son to be her last child.
   ``I just want Anita to be honest with me, I want her to become
self-sufficient, and she has promised to have no more children,''
he said. ``I will see to it that she gets medical care as well to
take care of that.''
   Gisclair, a 43-year-old New Orleans native and the principal
owner of six companies in Boca Raton, said he was tired of donating
to charities and not seeing the results. He went to Livia Garcia of
Miami's Community Development Department and said he wanted to help
real people he could see and talk to.
   ``Boy, have I got a family for you,'' Garcia said.
   Ms. Hunter had come to Garcia's office five months pregnant and
looking for help for her family.
   But she never dreamed of the likes of Gisclair, who she met just
last Friday.
   Ms. Hunter said Gisclair's requirement that she have no more
children was ``tiny'' compared with the chance he's giving her
family. She said the drug-ridden, inner-city neighborhood where she
lives now is so dangerous she doesn't let her children play outside.
   ``Now my children will have a chance to start a fresh new
life,'' Ms. Hunter said. ``That's all I've ever prayed for. These
kids deserve the best, and now, thanks to Mr. Gisclair, they will
have it.''

<TEXT>
   Officials checking a teen-ager's report
of a so-called ``Lizard Man'' found large tracks near Scape Ore
Swamp, and a Bigfoot researcher says the creature is a ``skunk
ape.''
   The search began almost two weeks ago when 17-year-old Chris
Davis says he was chased at speeds up to 40 mph by a tall, wet
green creature after he changed a tire about 2 a.m. near a bean
field.
   Since then, the swamp has been swamped with the curious,
including scores of news people, and Lee County Sheriff Liston
Truesdale has fielded hundreds of calls about the beast.
   ``You're dealing with a skunk ape, which is a colloquial name.
You can call it anything you want to, but it's a Bigfoot,'' said
Erik Beckjord, who has researched creature sightings for 10 years
and interviewed Davis.
   He said the Lizard Man sounds like the skunk ape that has
reportedly been seen in woods and swamps around the country since
1958.
   A state trooper and sheriff's deputy on patrol near the swamp
found the 14-inch by 7-inch tracks, and the sheriff made five sets
of plaster casts of them.
   While Truesdale said he believes Davis saw something, it
probably was a bear. He said it's likely a prankster was at work
Sunday when the tracks were found.
   ``Whoever did it, they sure did a convincing job,'' said the
sheriff.
   The prints were found on a dirt road that parallels the swamp
and traveled about 400 yards before stomping off into woods,
Truesdale said.
   The sheriff asked the State Law Enforcement Division to send
bloodhounds to scour the swamp.
   ``We couldn't find anybody coming out of there. And if it was
some `thing,' we wanted to see if the dog would trail it,''
Truesdale said.
   The hounds, however, failed to pick up a scent, probably because
of an afternoon rainstorm, said SLED spokesman Hugh Munn.
   ``They did see tracks. They had three toes and dug down into the
ground in six-foot strides. ... I can't even say this with a
straight face,'' Munn said.
   But others have told Truesdale they, too, have seen the red-eyed
creature, and this week the sheriff said he was tracking down
reports of tracks seen after a January snowstorm.
   The prints found Sunday are the same dimensions as a set found
in 1977 by the D.W. Berry family in Saluda County, officials said.
Sheriff's investigators there concluded the prints were made by a
prankster.
   A week before that, a 12-by-5-inch set of prints was found by
the Leonard Gromoske family in Fort Mill.
   Beckjord said skunk apes are harmless, sometimes travel in pairs
and quite frequently stink.
   ``Florida has more reports of skunk apes than any other state in
the nation,'' added Beckjord, founder of the National
Cryptozoological Society, which records sightings of creatures
whose existence is questioned by scientists.
   Beckjord, of Malibu, Calif., said Davis' account of the creature
coincides with other Bigfoot descriptions except for Lizard Man's
green skin. Most Bigfoot sightings are of hairy beasts, and the
majority have red eyes like Davis described, he said.

<HEAD>$5 Billion Offer Made In Marcos Letter, Says US Historian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
definitely offered to provide $5 billion to President Corazon
Aquino's government, a U.S. historian who relayed Marcos' feelers
about returning to his homeland said Wednesday.
   Boston University professor Allen Weinstein said the $5 billion
offer was in a proposal brought to him by a Marcos representative
and was part of the ``substance'' of a letter to him from Marcos.
   ``I was approached last month in Washington by a representative
of former President Marcos with a list of proposed `agreement
points' for an arrangement which would allow his return to the
Philippines,'' said Weinstein.
   The points were ``conditioned by an offer on his part to accept
the legitimacy of the Aquino government, stay out of politics,
throw his support behind Aquino and provide her government with $5
billion,'' Weinstein added.
   Weinstein identified the Marcos emissary as Jay Hoffman, a
California advertising man.
   In a statement Tuesday from Hawaii, where he lives in exile,
Marcos said ``negotiations'' about his return were taking place but
denied that he had offered to pay the money in exchange for
permission to return to the Philippines with immunity from
prosecution.
   Weinstein declined to comment on Marcos' denial. A source close
to the discussions with Marcos, insisting on anonymity, said the
ousted president's statement appeared worded to provide him
deniability.
   Weinstein is president of the Washington-based Center for
Democracy, a non-partisan U.S. organization promoting democracy
abroad and was a member of the U.S. observer team to the 1986
Philippine elections.
   Hoffman returned on July 13 with two letters signed by Marcos,
one addressed to President Aquino and one addressed to Weinstein,
``which outlined what I view as Mr. Marcos' personal petition to
the Philippine government'' said Weinstein.
   ``I sent President Aquino's letter to Manila, assured that it
would reach her, along with the substance, including the $5 billion
figure, of what was contained in the letter to me,'' Weinstein
said. He said he also sent the contents of the letters to
Philippine Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez.
   Pelaez could not be reached for comment. A Philippine Embassy
official confirmed that the ambassador received Marcos' letter but
added that the government does not take it seriously and Mrs.
Aquino did not receive it.
   A source knowledgeable of the Weinstein-Hoffman contacts said
the $5 billion was explicitly mentioned in Marcos' letter to
Weinstein but not in the one to President Aquino.
   The letter ``is authentic, but the offer is phony,'' said
Severina Rivera, a lawyer for the Philippine Commission on Good
Government which is charged with recovering Marcos' assets in the
United States. Rivera also said the Manila government has been not
been negotiating with Marcos.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
stressed law-and-order issues Wednesday, meeting with his state
anti-crime council and signing legislation to ease prison
overcrowding and fight child pornography.
   The Massachusetts governor also took what should be the last
step to close the books on the state's 1988 fiscal year, just
meeting a deadline to sign legislation providing $124 million. The
money is largely for underfunded entitlement programs such as
Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
   Top aides to Dukakis, meanwhile, struck back in answer to
Republican criticism of Dukakis and suggested Bush's search for a
running mate was not going well. But Dukakis himself generally
steered clear of such topics.
   Dukakis, who embarks on a seven-state campaign swing Thursday,
spent Wednesday tending to gubernatorial duties, meeting with his
anti-crime council and signing into law measures that will add
about 1,000 beds to the state's overcrowded prison system and
restore a child-pornography statute struck down by the state
Supreme Court.
   Later, he announced a number of other bill signings, including
the deficiency budget legislation _ the governor's last act in
erasing a $400 million shortfall during fiscal 1988, which ended
June 30.
   Dukakis held a public ceremony to sign the prison and
child-pornography bills not long after senior Dukakis aides held a
briefing at which they said that Bush, the certain Republican
nominee, and the Republican Party were having to scramble to give
their fall effort direction and that Bush had begun his vice
presidential search on a sour note.
   Dukakis refused to enter that fray, telling reporters he did not
know details of Bush's search and saying every candidate had a
personal approach to such tasks.
   His aides were less kind.
   ``It is our view that the process has not begun well,'' said
Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign manager. She cited reports that
Bush had a pollster, Robert Teeter, heading the search, and that
Bush was requesting background information from New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu and other Republicans who were not being seriously
considered, just to placate them.
   Estrich also criticized Bush and other Republicans for what she
called ``an early decision to go negative'' and attributed sharp
criticism of Dukakis by Republicans to a lack of good things to say
about Bush.
   ``It's a bit early in the campaign to have run out of positive
things to say about your own candidate,'' Estrich said.
   Many Democratic speakers at last week's Democratic National
Convention, including keynoter Ann Richards, criticized Bush at
length, receiving loud applause for comments ridiculing the vice
president.
   Estrich said that Dukakis planned to campaign during the
Republican National Convention next month but that an itinerary had
not been established.
   ``We do not plan any fishing or hunting trips during that
period,'' she said, referring to a trip Bush took with Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker during the first few days of the
Democratic convention. ``We plan to campaign.''
   Dukakis, in addition to signing the crime and prison bills
Wednesday, announced distribution of $7.8 million in state and
federal grants for victim assistance programs.
   He said that Massachusetts has been a national leader in
``increasing sensitivity and awareness of what it is like to be a
victim of crime,'' and he also said there has been a 13 percent
drop in crime in his state in the past four years.
   Dukakis shrugged off questions about Bush's repeated criticism
of a Massachusetts furlough program that, until it was amended,
allowed passes to first-degree murderers, including a man who
escaped from a furlough and raped a Maryland woman.
   ``I've got a record,'' Dukakis said, referring to the crime
statistics and other programs. ``I don't know what the vice
president's record is.''

   President Reagan, encouraging a reform-minded
Eastern European Communist Party leader, praised Hungarian Premier
Karoly Grosz Wednesday for ``your openness to new ideas.''
   At the conclusion of the first-ever official White House visit
by a Hungarian Communist Party leader, Reagan and Grosz agreed that
economic reform in Hungary will necessitate a freer political
climate.
   ``Hungary has to face enormous tasks today,'' Grosz said through
an interpreter during a departure statement on the South Lawn of
the White House. ``This can only be done, we are aware, if the
people, if the citizens enjoy more rights, more freedoms.''
   Reagan told Grosz, ``We are encouraged by your recognition that
economic reforms cannot succeed unless acompanied by political
reforms as well.''
   The president said that decisions to be made by Grosz'
government in the coming months ``will set the direction of
Hungary's development over the next decade,'' adding that ``we have
been impressed with your openness to new ideas.''
   Grosz replied that ``we are modernizing our political system and
our political practices.''
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Grosz said his visit
symbolized a ``new era of detente'' in East-West relations which
``provides not only the superpowers but the small and medium-sized
powers with the opportunity to participate in a dialogue.''
   He said the current relaxation of tensions is ``much deeper''
and ``much richer'' than the detente era of the 1970's.
   Grosz said the administration promised to review ways in which
Hungarian products can have greater access to U.S. markets.
   On Tuesday, Grosz, who leaves Washington for Niagara Falls,
N.Y., on Thursday, indicated in a National Press Club speech that
political reform has to be carried out within the framework of
Hungary's one party state.
   A senior administration official, describing Wednesday's talks
on grounds he not be publicly identified, acknowledged there was no
discussion between Reagan and Grosz of any possible move to a
multi-party system in Hungary.
   This official said Reagan wanted to focus attention on Grosz
because of the Hungarian's interest in establishing economic ties
with the United States and his willingness to consider internal
change.
   This official said that while the United States believes Hungary
has improved its human rights situation, it could do more in the
area of permitting demonstrations and dissent. But he said
``freedom of travel'' from the Warsaw Pact country has improved
substantially.
   The official also said the two leaders did not discuss the
question of possible withdrawal of the 65,000 Soviet troops based
in Hungary.
   Several weeks ago, State Department officials had received
increasing indications that a Soviet military retreat from its
Warsaw Pact ally was likely.
   Grosz told the National Press Club gathering that any Soviet
troop pullback from Hungary would have to be part of general
scaling down of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe.
   The visit was the first ever by a Hungarian party leader since
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago. Grosz became
premier a year ago and was named party chief in May.

   NBC named Iowa newspaper editor Michael G.
Gartner as president of its struggling news division on Wednesday,
hours after Lawrence K. Grossman said he was leaving because ``it
hasn't been all that fun lately.''
   ``Different times call for different types of people,'' NBC
President Robert C. Wright said as he announced the appointment.
   Gartner has most recently been a part-time general news
executive with Gannett Co. Inc. and editor of the Ames, Iowa, Daily
Tribune. A former president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, he is also former editor of The Courier-Journal of
Louisville, Ky., the Des Moines (Iowa) Register and the front page
of The Wall Street Journal.
   Grossman, who left public broadcasting four years ago to join
the network, said he is quitting because of differences with the
executives installed by General Electric, which bought the network
in 1986.
   ``It's time for them to get their own guy in there,'' Grossman
said in Los Angeles, where he was attending an NBC meeting.
``Things have changed. It hasn't been all that fun lately. I've
been there four years. It's a difference in style, personality and
priorities.''
   Gartner said that he had met Wright a couple of months ago, in a
meeting about First Amendment issues. He said Wright had asked to
meet him in Atlanta, and offered the job last Wednesday.
   ``He wants me to lead, he wants me to manage, he wants me to use
my news judgment, and he wants me to be a good businessman,''
Gartner said in an interview, ``but most of all he wants me to
think about the future and help lead NBC into the future, safely
and soundly, and with vigor.''
   Gartner said that he and Wright had not discussed the network's
third-place position in the evening news ratings, or the
possibility of launching another prime-time news program.
   ``I'll go over there tomorrow and meet everybody, and I assume
I'll start working,'' Gartner said. Though he had not been to NBC
headequarters Wednesday, he added, ``I think I started working
today.''
   John Chancellor, the veteran NBC correspondent and commentator,
said he has known Gartner for many years and praised the
appointment as ``audacious and intelligent.''
   ``We get various reactions to it around the water cooler here,''
Chancellor said in an interview. ``One is that Bob Wright has set
good journalism as his first priority _ that's obviously clear.
Another reaction I would have is that Gartner will be able to prove
that good journalism is the heart of the enterprise.''
   Gartner, 49, veered off the fast track in 1987 to become editor
at the 10,000-circulation Ames Tribune, which he owned with two
partners. He continued to hold the title of General News Executive
of the Gannett Co. and USA Today and divided his time between Iowa
and Washington.
   Those who have worked with Gartner, who is also a lawyer,
describe him as a creative, hard-driving editor with an ability to
inspire a staff.
   ``He has an electric personality,'' said James P. Gannon, editor
of the Des Moines Register. ``He's a brilliant journalist, a great
idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on
morale in the newsroom.''
   Dennis Waller, general manager of the Ames Tribune, said Gartner
has ``an energy field that gets everybody fired up. He is just an
exceptional individual. He's the best questioner I've ever heard in
my life.''
   Waller said Gartner would retain the title of editor of the
Tribune and plans to commute to Des Moines on weekends.
   Grossman is former president of the Public Broadcasting Service,
where he fostered PBS documentaries, including the award-winning
series ``Frontline.''
   During his tenure at NBC News, ``Nightly News'' and the
``Today'' show rose to No. 1 in the ratings. Recently, though,
``Nightly News'' has fallen to third in the close competition among
the evening newscasts. Although ``Today'' has remained in first
place and expanded to ``Sunday Today,'' NBC News recently lost the
show's executive producer, Steve Friedman, to GTG Entertainment,
where he is producing ``USA Today: The Television Show.''
   Despite its three-year first-place status in the prime-time
ratings, NBC has not successfully launched a prime-time news show.
The last was ``1986,'' canceled before the end of the year for
which it was named. The cancellation prompted the departure of
anchor Roger Mudd to PBS' ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.''
   Grossman, whose resignation was effective immediately, wouldn't
say what his plans were other than to leave for a vacation Friday.
   The change at NBC News marked the second time in a month that
corporate bosses have reached outside the network to hire a news
president.
   CBS recently named ABC News executive David Burke to replace
Howard Stringer as president of CBS News. Stringer was promoted to
head of the CBS Broadcast Group.
   Like his colleagues, Stringer at CBS and ABC News President
Roone Arledge, Grossman presided over cutbacks at the news division
prompted by new corporate owners and a slowdown in advertising
revenues at all three networks.
   Grossman differed with his corporate bosses over the cuts, which
reportedly created a rift between him and GE.

<TEXT>
   A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in the
drug-dealing case against reputed mobster Gene Gotti and two
co-defendants after a haggard jury announced it was deadlocked on
the seventh day of deliberations.
   ``The time has come to declare a mistrial,'' U.S. District Judge
Joseph McLaughlin said before calling the jury back into the
courtroom, ending the second trial stemming from a 1983 indictment.
   The earlier trial also ended with a mistrial in January. In that
case, prosecutors accused the defendants of jury tampering, a
charge U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said remains under
investigation.
   This time, the foreman of the anonymous jury said jurors were
troubled by a defense claim that tape recordings, made from an FBI
bug placed in the kitchen of co-defendant Angelo Ruggiero's home,
might have been tampered with by the government to fit the case.
   ``The jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence
is, in fact, tampering,'' said Jeffrey Hoffman, attorney for
Ruggiero.
   ``We only hope the court system will recognize this situation
and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not
once again have to undergo criminal proceedings,'' he concluded.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert LaRusso denied the tampering
charges, but agreed with defense lawyers that no one was happy with
the result.
   ``I feel empty, having been with it for so long and not having a
resolution,'' said LaRusso.
   Gotti's attorney, Ronald Fishetti, said Gotti, brother of
reputed Gambino family head John Gotti, was not happy.
   ``He wants this matter resolved once and for all,'' the attorney
said.
   And George Santangelo, attorney for defendant John Carneglia,
said, ``A mistrial isn't a victory. It's a non-verdict.''
   Gotti, 41, of Valley Stream, Ruggiero, 48, of Cedarhurst, and
Carneglia, 43, are charged in a 1983 indictment with supervising a
multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation.
   The judge set Sept. 7 as a tentative retrial date. The second
trial began in May.
   Earlier Wednesday, McLaughlin had sent the jurors back to
deliberate despite a pessimistic message from the anonymous panel's
foreman: ``Your honor, it's a dead point.''
   The jurors began rehearing the FBI tapes Sunday as they
considered charges of heroin possession, obstruction of justice,
conspiracy, racketeering and running a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   News of a deadlock surfaced after the jury sent a note to the
judge at 11:45 a.m., that said, ``After breaking yesterday, we all
gave serious thought to where we were heading _ it amounted to
nowhere.''
   ``We unanimously agreed that we will be unable to reach a
verdict on any count, no matter how long we are asked to continue
deliberating,'' said the note.
   Only 11 jurors were deliberating because one juror was excused
after a federal marshal found several grams of cocaine in clothing
that was delivered to him Tuesday, Maloney said. Maloney said the
matter is being investigated by the FBI.

   A former Irish diplomat in London accused
by British authorities of selling fake passports lost an appeal
Wednesday to block his extradition.
   Ireland's Supreme Court ruled that a lower court was wrong to
free Kevin McDonald, 38, in the belief that the Irish government
had kept his diplomatic immunity.
   McDonald fled to Ireland after a British newspaper, The People,
reported he sold false Irish passports for up to $26,000 to Libyan,
Iranian and Lebanese citizens while working at the Irish Embassy.
Irish police arrested him in August 1987.
   The Supreme Court agreed with a High Court ruling in March that
said British legal experts should have been heard in the case.
   McDonald, free on bail, now faces extradition proceedings in
District Court.

   Two acting Justice Department officials on
Wednesday insisted the agency is running smoothly, with no hint of
the ``deep malaise'' portrayed by two of their predecessors who
quit in protest earlier this year.
   At their confirmation hearing for permanent positions, Francis
A. Keating II and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. painted a rosy picture of
department operations under outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who presided at the Senate Judiciary
Committee session, warned Keating and Dennis that ``removal of
clouds is essential.''
   Since May, Keating has served as acting associate attorney
general, the department's No. 3 position. A month later, Dennis
took over the top spot in the criminal division on an acting basis.
President Reagan has nominated both men to hold those jobs
permanently for the remaining half-year of his administration.
   On Tuesday, former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
testified that when he resigned March 29 a ``deep malaise'' had set
in at the department in the face of Meese's legal problems.
   William E. Weld, who preceded Dennis as criminal division chief,
told the committee that if Meese were an ordinary citizen, he
probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from E.
Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of the attorney general.
   Keating told the committee that when he went to the department
from a top Treasury Department position, ``I was under the
impression there was a black hole, that morale was shattered. I
found that was not the case. Morale was not on the floor.
   ``I don't think morale was as serious a problem as portrayed by
Mr. Burns and Mr. Weld, at least since April. At this time I think
the department is functioning well.''
   ``Have you seen an instance where Meese acted improperly?''
asked Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah and a Meese supporter.
   Keating: ``All of my professional associations with the attorney
general have been correct and proper.'' He called Burns and Weld
``professionals, men of integrity and decency,'' who simply had a
different view of department morale.
   Dennis, who started at the department in June, said, ``No, I
didn't see any malaise. I found the criminal division conducting
itself according to the highest standards.''
   Hatch told him ``There are some who will never like Attorney
General Meese. The department functions well and does a good job.''
   But the senator also had criticism for Meese, saying he
``probably shouldn't have made'' comments critical of Burns and
Weld on Monday.
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Meese said that if Burns
and Weld had conducted a competent and thorough preliminary inquiry
of his conduct, there likely would have been no need for an
independent counsel's investigation.
   Meese has announced he will resign at the end of the month now
that Independent Counsel James McKay has decided not to bring
charges against him following a lengthy investigation. McKay
concluded that Meese ``probably committed'' three felonies and a
misdemeanor. Meese has sharply criticized the findings.

   A military judge Wednesday found Pvt.
Adrian Morris Jr. guilty of two AIDS-related court-martial charges
but acquitted the soldier of other charges.
   Army Col. Raymond D. Cole convicted Morris of bringing discredit
upon the Army for engaging in unprotected sex early in 1987 after
testing positive for presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus and
having been counseled to take precautions if having sex.
   Cole also found Morris guilty of consensual sodomy with
then-Pfc. Anthony L. Baldwin during March 1987.
   The judge acquitted Morris of aggravated assault against Baldwin
and a soldier identified only as Pfc. Jane Doe. He also found
Morris innocent of two counts of conduct bringing discredit upon
the Army.
   ``I am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his
sexual partners,'' Cole said in acquitting Morris of assault.
   ``By God's good grace, and blind luck, no one was infected.''
   Cole later sentenced Morris to receive a bad-conduct discharge,
but did not set a specific date for it. Morris is scheduled for
release from the Army in November.
   The judge also restricted Morris for 60 days to Fort Huachuca
outside this southeast Arizona town, ordered him to forfeit $1,200
in pay over three months and ordered him not to have unprotected
sex.
   The sodomy charge alone carried a maximum term of five years in
prison. Cole had indicated previously that he would not impose a
prison term on a discredit conviction.
   Morris hugged his mother after the sentencing and told reporters
he was ``surprised because I was expecting the whole 17'' years in
prison, the maximum penalty if he had been convicted of all the
charges. He said he had expected a heavy sentence ``because of the
emotion surrounding it and the disease itself.''
   Morris said he would not stay in the military even if his
automatic appeal is successful, but he said, ``I don't feel any
remorse toward the Army and the press.''
   The bad conduct dischage is considered better than a
dishonorable discharge because Morris may be entitled to retain
some veterans benefits.
   Col. Harry C. Beans III, staff judge advocate at Fort Huachuca
whose office prosecuted Morris, said he was trying to ``figure out
the judge's logic with our failure to prove an aggravated assault.
Quite frankly, I thought we did it, I thought we made our case.''
   Beans said, ``The sentence is light, but you can understand that
this soldier has had this cloud hanging over his head for 17
months.''
   Morris, 28, of Caseyville, Ill., was accused of having
threatened the health of Baldwin and two female soldiers by failing
to use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus, which indicated he may develop AIDS
and could spread it.
   He was the first member of the armed forces charged with
AIDS-related offenses in March 1987. Legal issues delayed his
trial, though, and military courts have tried other AIDS-related
cases in the interim.
   Cole said Morris' case was ``fact-specific,'' involving
knowledge about AIDS two years ago, and therefore would have little
value as a precedent in other cases.
   Cole ruled after receiving written closing arguments from the
prosecution and hearing oral arguments from the defense Wednesday
afternoon.
   Capt. Gaylen Whatcott, the prosecutor, called 10 witnesses
Tuesday, including Morris' two alleged female victims. They
testified that Morris had told them he had a rare or incurable
blood disease but did not mention acquired immune deficiency
syndrome before having sex with them.
   Cole permitted Whatcott to submit a transcript of pretrial
testimony from Baldwin after the government said it was unable to
find him for the trial.
   Baldwin's 1987 testimony included a description of homosexual
activity with Morris.
   In addition, the judge allowed the prosecution to admit medical
records reflecting Morris' AIDS test results, despite defense
objections that the government had not demonstrated sufficiently
that adequate steps were taken to secure blood drawn in 1986 when
Morris was tested for AIDS.

   Two Democrats charged Wednesday that campaign
tax proposals by Republican nominee-to-be George Bush would undo
``Ronald Reagan's greatest achievement.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri said tax cuts suggested by Bush would destroy the
Reagan-backed Tax Reform Act of 1986. They specifically blasted
Bush's plans to reduce the tax rate on capital gains, and to
increase tax credits for oil and gas exploration.
   Bush says the capital-gains cut would stimulate investment and
generate long-term revenue. The oil and gas breaks would restore an
estimated $1 billion in credits lost by energy developers in the
1986 reforms.
   But Bradley, a major figure in the writing of the 1986
tax-reform bill, called Bush's plans ``an attempt to dismantle tax
reform, which is Ronald Reagan's greatest achievement.''
   ``George Bush is practicing the old politics of pandering to the
special interests,'' Bradley said.
   Gephardt echoed the charge, saying the rich and powerful ``have
never really had to ask where Bush was. He's always been in their
corner.''

   New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey on
Wednesday announced the formation of a new coalition to push for a
strong conservative running mate for likely Republican nominee
George Bush.
   Humphrey said the Coalition For a Winning Ticket isn't going to
be ``a stalking horse for any one candidate,'' but instead will
serve as ``a rallying point for conservatives who hope to persuade
the vice president to choose someone from the conservative majority
of the party.''
   Bush would lose the election if he picked a less conservative
candidate ``from the minority wing of the party, which is the old
line country club establishment,'' Humphrey predicted.
   He said a more conservative candidate is needed to attract the
conservative Democrats and independents who helped elect Ronald
Reagan. Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis would get more votes if
a less conservative running mate were selected, he said.

   An Irish teen-ager with a history of running
away from home stowed away on a U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer,
and five sailors accused of helping her during 10 days at sea have
been arrested, officials said Wednesday.
   Police in Ireland identified the 16-year-old girl as Suzanne
Twomey of Cork. She was hospitalized in satisfactory condition
Wednesday after an illness delayed attempts to return her to
Ireland.
   The five sailors accused of helping her during the USS
Conyngham's trip were being held at the Norfolk Naval Base.
   The teen-ager was found aboard the destroyer Saturday when it
returned from its visit to Ireland. She was being taken to Atlanta
for a return flight when she became ill.
   After an emergency landing Tuesday night in Raleigh, N.C., the
girl was taken to Rex Hospital, where was discharged Wednesday
evening.
   Charles Coble Jr., an agent with the Naval Investigative
Service, said travel arrangements were being made for the girl. He
would not elaborate and neither he nor hospital officials knew
where she was spending Wednesday night.
   The girl apparently slipped aboard the Conyngham while it was on
a courtesy call in Cork Harbor. The ship held an open house during
the visit, and that is apparently when the girl slipped aboard,
officials said.
   Lt. Cmdr. John W. Lloyd, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk,
said the girl was discovered in a 2{-foot by 15-foot utility
passage when the ship docked.
   Five sailors who allegedly helped the girl are in the base brig,
Lloyd said. Some of the sailors apparently brought food and water
to the girl during the 10-day Atlantic crossing.
   ``No charges have yet been filed,'' said Lloyd.
   Lloyd said the girl was expected to be released from Rex
Hospital sometime Wednesday to continue her trip home. Irish police
said they expected her to take a Thursday flight from Atlanta to
Ireland.
   According to the Naval Investigative Service, the girl, escorted
by an NIS agent, was flown Tuesday from Norfolk to Washington, D.C.
From there, she and her escort boarded a flight from Washington to
Atlanta, where she was to catch a connecting flight to Ireland.
   ``I understand she became ill on the flight to Atlanta, that she
complained to her escort of nausea and then went into
convulsions,'' NIS Agent Charles Coble said. The plane made an
unscheduled landing in Raleigh to drop her off.
   A Dublin police spokesman, who would not give his name, said the
girl was reported missing by her parents, John and Christine
Twomey. The spokesman said the girl was the eldest of four children
and had run away from home several times _ once having to be
returned home from Spain.
   The parents declined to talk with the press.
   The girl had originally told Navy officials that she was
orphaned when she was 13 and always wanted to come to America to
find work.
   Archie Galloway, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the girl
was treated for dehydration Saturday at the Portsmouth Naval
Hospital. He said a full physical found no health problems.
   If charged and convicted, the five sailors face a maximum five
years in prison and a fine of $2,000 for aiding an illegal entry
into the United States, officials said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Medicaid Abortion Payments To Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS new 3rd graf with final passage of appropriations
bill.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to extend Medicaid
abortion payments to rape and incest victims, although President
Reagan has said he might veto a $140 billion appropriations bill
over the issue.
   The 73-19 vote came during the third day of contentious debate
on the fiscal 1989 appropriations bill for the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.
   The massive spending bill, covering most of the nation's social
spending, was approved 80-16 at the end of a confusing day of
parliamentary maneuvers, reversals and last-minute amendments.
   Medicaid now pays for poor women's abortions only if their lives
are endangered. The Senate vote was the first time either chamber
of Congress had expanded eligibility since 1981.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who championed the move, said it
would help ``break the chain and get moving in the other
direction'' after years of restrictive federal abortion regulations.
   As approved on the floor, the provision requires prompt
reporting of the rape or incest incident in order for a victim to
qualify for federal funds. It also gives state legislatures
authority to adopt less liberal funding schemes.
   ``I sincerely believe this amendment reflects the middle ground
... protects the maximum number of lives,'' said Sen. James Exon,
D-Neb., who offered the modified floor amendment.
   The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill passed by the House
does not expand eligibility for Medicaid abortions beyond what is
permitted in current law. That difference and others will be
resolved in a House-Senate conference committee.
   The Office of Management and Budget has said presidential
advisers would recommend a veto of the entire apropriations bill _
which would keep the three agencies in business after the new
fiscal year starts Oct. 1 _ over the Medicaid expansion.
   Weicker said he agreed to the Exon modifications because they
gave his provision a better chance of surviving conference. As far
as a possible veto, he predicted that ``considering everything else
that's in the bill and that it's an election year, it could be
overridden.''
   The massive appropriations bill, which includes $1.2 billion for
AIDS research, education, prevention and treatment, drew numerous
amendments on family planning, abortion and AIDS.
   In several instances the Senate first rebuffed and then accepted
amendments on controversial subjects.
   Senators earlier in the week rejected attempts to eliminate and
restrict the federal family planning program for low-income women.
On Wednesday they voted against a ban on federal money for school
clinics that distribute contraceptives, then later approved the ban
for school clinics that provide abortion counseling or referral
services.
   They also rejected several attempts to renew a ban on federal
money for AIDS education material that encourages or promotes
homosexuality, then approved two amendments that sent conflicting
messages on the same subject.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who sponsored the AIDS education
restrictions last year, failed several times to extend them on
Wednesday.
   But the Senate later embraced an amendment that not only
contains the Helms restrictions but also says federally funded AIDs
materials cannot ``use words stating that homosexuality is
`normal,' `natural' or `healthy.''' Lawmakers voted 82-15 not to
kill it and then approved it by voice vote.
   Weicker called the amendment, sponsored by Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., ``an exercise in bigotry, period. It's about the most
objectionable thing I've seen on the Senate floor.''
   The Humphrey amendment won approval after the Senate voted 61-37
for what Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., labeled a pre-emptive strike
against the Helms restrictions.
   The Cranston amendment bans federal funds for material that
directly promotes or encourages homosexual or heterosexual sexual
activity or intravenous drug use, but at the same time says AIDS
education programs and materials must provide accurate information
on how to avoid AIDS.
   Some senators who voted for the Helms restrictions last year
said they did not anticipate the chilling effect they would have on
the war against AIDS.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said a study by his Governmental
Affairs investigations subcommittee found that the amendment had
delayed program funding, diverted staff time, slowed the
distribution of educational materials and prompted some educators
to produce material that is less explicit, less risky and less
effective.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he initially thought the
measure was toothless but ``it is a fact that effective materials
have been shelved and vital proposals have been tabled because of
the fear of what this amendment might do.''
   In other action Wednesday, the Senate voted 48-45 to kill a
Helms amendment that would have banned federal funds for
contraceptives or contraceptive prescriptions issued on school
premises. The target was school-based clinics, which receive some
Medicaid and block grant money.
   But later lawmakers approved by voice vote a more limited ban on
funds to school-based clinics that provide abortion services.

<HEAD>Defense Concludes Summation at Biaggi Case; Attacks Meese Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi's defense lawyer took a final
swing at Attorney General Edwin Meese III in closing arguments at
the Wedtech corruption trial Wednesday, calling Meese ``a crook''
and the case against the congressman ``a frame.''
   Attorney James LaRossa's remarks sparked a bitter exchange with
prosecutors while the jury was out of the room.
   Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others are accused of a racketeering
conspiracy that turned Wedtech Corp. _ a now-bankrupt military
contractor _ into a cash cow that paid out millions of dollars in
bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts.
   But a cornerstone of the defense case has been the theory that
four corrupt Wedtech executives who testified for the government
had links to White House insiders like Meese and did not need to
bribe Biaggi.
   ``If these four people from Wedtech knew that they had an open
door to the White House,'' said LaRossa, ``you tell me what they
needed Mario Biaggi for. Extra baggage?''
   In his closing argument to the jury last week, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Edward J. Little sought to defuse the so-called ``Meese
defense'' by conceding ``Meese is a sleaze'' but insisting that it
had no bearing on Biaggi's alleged crimes.
   But LaRossa, the last defense attorney to sum up before the
jury, said the case was really about Meese.
   ``Sleaze is not enough. We're talking about a crook. We're
talking about a man who today sits in a building with that eagle in
front of it,'' LaRossa said, pointing to the Great Seal above the
judge's bench, ``the attorney general of the United States. He got
promoted for being a crook.''
   Meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing but has admitted
getting key aides to help Wedtech win an Army contract while he was
White House counselor.
   Meese was under scrutiny for some time because of his Wedtech
connections, but a special prosecutor in Washington, James C.
McKay, determined there was insufficient evidence to charge Meese
with wrongdoing. However, McKay questioned the attorney general's
ethics on several issues.
   Meese has said he will leave office later this summer.
   ``You don't think Ed Meese wants you to convict Mario Biaggi?''
LaRossa asked the jury. ``He'd throw a party if you did.''
   At another point he said Wedtech obtained the Army contract
without Biaggi's help, adding the case against Biaggi ``is a phony,
ladies and gentlemen, it's a frame.''
   LaRossa also attacked the four cooperating Wedtech officials _
Fred Neuberger, Mario Moreno, Anthony Guariglia and Lawrence
Shorten _ as ``vultures'' who ``lived for money.''
   All four pleaded guilty to state and federal corruption charges
and testified in exchange for leniency. All four also admitted to
stealing millions of dollars from the company when they weren't
trying to cheat the government or each other.
   Little bitterly protested LaRossa's comments about Meese to the
judge during a recess with the jury out of the room.
   LaRossa claimed he meant the four cooperating Wedtech witnesses
were framing Biaggi _ not the prosecution.
   But the defense attorney stuck to his prediction of a
post-conviction celebration by Meese.
   ``Meese created the swindle that led to the indictment,''
LaRossa said during the exchange, insisting that a Biaggi
conviction ``will take his participation in Wedtech away from the
public.''
   Little accused LaRossa of ``poisoning'' the jury's mind and
``leaving them with the impression that Meese is behind this case.''
   ``I will stipulate that Meese engaged in improper conduct in
connection with this case and I said so in my summation,'' said
Little, adding that LaRossa was hinting Meese, somehow, was behind
Biaggi's indictment.
   ``Your argument is deceptive,'' Little told LaRossa, who shot
back: ``Maybe you'd also like me to put a bound over my mouth so I
won't talk. That might also be more helpful to you.''
   The prosecution was slated to present its rebuttal argument to
the jury Thursday, paving the way later this week for the judge's
instruction on the law to jurors and the start of deliberations in
the four-month-old trial.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Wednesday that he raised ``very specifically'' with Iran's
foreign minister the issue of American and other hostages held by
pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   ``This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' the
U.N. chief told reporters after meeting Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati of Iran for two hours. ``I raised it very, very
specifically.''
   Perez de Cuellar did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response
and Velayati later did not answer reporters' questions about the
hostages.
   Earlier Wednesday, Perez de Cuellar told reporters he thought
Iran might help on the hostage issue for ``humanitarian and
political'' reasons.
   The question was raised in talks concerning the implementation
of a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker and military
commander, offered on Tuesday to help get the nine Americans freed
if the United States would release Iranian assets frozen since 1979.
   U.S. officials said Washington would not ransom the Americans,
who are among 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Held longest of the
18 is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   ``I intend to do it (raise the hostage issue with Iran) because
I feel that their good offices will be very good for obtaining the
release of the hostages,'' the secretary-general told reporters
earlier.
   ``I think they might assert their possible influence in order to
have this problem out of the way for both the humanitarian and
political business.''
   He said the hostages were a ``parallel issue'' to ending the
war. Perez de Cuellar has pursued the hostage question previously
with Iranians and others.
   Rafsanjani said Tuesday: ``If they (the Americans) really want
to talk, let them take a non-hostile pose by releasing our assets.
If so, we will use our influence in Lebanon and intercede to solve
the problem of hostages.''
   In a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Velayati said ``The problem
of hostages in Lebanon is a question relating to the Lebanese.
   ``It is not our question, but on the basis of humanitarian
aspects we will do our best, as we have done till now, and we do
hope that all innocent people as hostages in Lebanon or anyplace
else ... could be released very soon.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said Wednesday he believed the
secretary-general's ``good offices could help. What was ineffective
in the old days may not be so today. Things are moving, things are
changing.''
   Asked about Rafsanjani's statement and the U.S. response,
Walters said: ``We are not closing the door on anything. We
maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail.
   ``The hostages are ... with us day and night, in our heart and
our mind always, and we will do whatever is honorable and decent
and won't provoke more hostage taking.''
   Walters said he has visited Syria five times to discuss the
matter and ``the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages
in such a way that they won't be replaced by another group of
hostages.''

   The U.N. secretary-general held separate
peace talks with the foreign ministers of Iraq and Iran Wednesday
on a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war, but Iraq insisted that
face-to-face negotiations with Iran must precede any truce.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said that he also
raised ``very, very specifically'' with Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati the issue of American and other hostages held by
pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   ``This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' he
told reporters after meeting Velayati for two hours. ``I raised it
very, very specifically.''
   He did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response and Velayati
later did not answer questions about the hostages.
   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. chief told reporters he thought Iran
might help on the hostage issue for ``humanitarian and political''
reasons.
   Perez de Cuellar met for two hours with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz in the morning and saw Velayati in the evening. No
substance was disclosed.
   It was the first full day of separate talks with both
adversaries. Perez de Cuellar met Velayati for almost three hours
Tuesday.
   Aziz told reporters Wednesday that Iraq will not be
``stampeded'' into a settlement.
   Iraq's insistence on direct talks appeared to raise difficulties
for agreement on a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
   Perez de Cuellar said he could not require the belligerents to
hold direct talks if Iran objects. Iran opposes direct talks at
this time but left the door open to a request by the
secretary-general.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters Wednesday night he was awaiting
answers from both sides on his proposals for implementing a
cease-fire and peace plan, mandated by the Security Council one
year ago.
   Some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
problems appeared to be cropping up in the negotiations because of
Iraq's insistent attitude, its military offensive and the use of
outlawed chemical warfare.
   They noted that Aziz described as a ``courtesy call'' his
official visit with the secretary-general, while U.N. officials
described it as ``substantive.''
   Perez de Cuellar said Iran's first responses were ``hopeful
proposals.''
   No formal meetings were scheduled Thursday.
   Before Aziz entered U.N. Headquarters Wednesday, he said Iraq
insists on face-to-face negotiations with Iran before it will
accept a cease-fire. Last Monday Iran abruptly said it would accept
a cease-fire after rejecting a U.N. cease-fire for one year.
   Perez de Cuellar said, ``The Iranians know this request from the
Iraqi side and I imagine they are considering it.''
   Velayati did not answer questions on direct talks after his
meeting Wednesday night. He said Iran ``responded very
postitively'' to the secretary-general's proposals. He did not
elaborate.
   Perez de Cuellar has not disclosed his current proposals for
implementing a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and
other parts of a Security Council peace plan adopted in July 1987.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati countered Iraq's
call for direct talks by charging that Iraq was procrastinating and
sabotaging U.N. peace efforts. He said he lodged a protest with the
Security Council over Iraq's purported use of chemical weapons.
   ``How can we take the Iraqis seriously when ... they are using
chemical weapons?'' Mahallati said to reporters.
   Perez de Cuellar said a solution ``cannot be done on terms of
one side or the other'' and urged both governments to ``help me in
finding a solution through compromise.''
   On the way into his meeting with the U.N. chief, Aziz said,
``Iraq shall not allow (itself) to be stampeded to reach (a
cease-fire) or to make a hasty step under the present
circumstances.''
   Aziz said his government wants ``real peace _ durable and
comprehensive,'' but doubts Iran's intentions.
   ``We shall seek guarantees and we believe that the first step
and the starter for constructive work is face-to-face negotiations
between the two parties under the auspices of the
secretary-general,'' Aziz said.
   ``If the Iranians do not accept that formula, that means that
they are not sincere about peace.''
   Diplomats and U.N. officials said pressure was mounting on Iraq
to soften its position and stop the ground offensive it began after
Iran announced on July 18 that it would accept the U.N. cease-fire
resolution. Iraq accepted Resolution 598 soon after the 15-member
Security Council passed it unanimously on July 20, 1987.
   Resolution 598 provides for a truce, withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
to determine which side started the war. Iraq invaded Iraq in
September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

   A pair of ``missing'' newlyweds have turned up
alive and well in California, police said Wednesday, 3{ months
after the couple dropped out of sight without a word to relatives
or classmates at a suburban Christian college.
   The father of Carolyn MacLean, 22, who eloped with Scott
Swanson, 23, said the couple was ``madly in love'' and disappeared
so they could spend time alone together.
   The bride's parents, Jim and Kathy MacLean, flew to San Diego on
Wednesday afternoon for a reunion later in the day with the couple.
   ``We just know they are alive and well and very happy and very
anxious to see us,'' said MacLean, who was asked when he arrived in
San Diego if he was upset with his daughter and son-in-law. ``I'm a
father. I don't think they ran from us.
   ``They ran to something else. They were interested in perfect
love ... That's what it appears to be from what we've been able to
piece together,'' MacLean told reporters.
   The couple, both students at Wheaton College in suburban
Chicago, had eloped a week before they vanished April 2. Their
ransacked luxury car was found in an alley in downtown Chicago, its
motor still running.
   The couple were not seen or heard from until they sent letters
to their parents and contacted the MacLeans by telephone Tuesday,
police Commander Ettore DiVito said Wednesday.
   The newlyweds were not at San Diego's Lindbergh Field on
Wednesday afternoon when the MacLeans arrived. MacLean said they
were headed for a private reunion with the couple at a hotel.
   After the couple vanished, police in three states poured
resources into the search, and friends at Wheaton College held
prayer vigils, put up posters and questioned people at roadside
restaurants and gas stations.
   ``We're disappointed that they would put people through all that
grief, but at the same time, we're glad that they're OK,'' said
Christy Hodson, a spokeswoman for Wheaton, a private, evangelical
Christian school.
   ``We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours,''
said DiVito, who headed the investigation. He said police may try
to recover the costs of their efforts, but refused to comment
further.
   DiVito refused to provide details about the condition or
whereabouts of the couple except to say they had called from the
San Diego area.
   ``As far as I know, there is no criminal activity involved in
the case,'' said DiVito.
   ``Isn't that terrible? Two yuppie zeros costing taxpayers all
that money,'' said a Chicago police officer after DiVito's news
conference. He refused to give his name.
   The elder MacLean said in San Diego that his daughter and
son-in-law would ``touch base'' with the Chicago Police Department
later Wednesday. He wouldn't disclose their whereabouts.
   ``They were madly in love with each other and I really believed
that a significant part of it was that they just wanted to spend
time together,'' he said. ``We haven't asked them any particular
questions. We're here as mother and dad, really.''
   Ms. MacLean's parents, who live in Haddonfield, N.J., told
police Wednesday morning they had heard from the couple, DiVito
said. Swanson's parents were vacationing and may not have heard the
news, he said.
   Telephones went unanswered Wednesday at the homes of both sets
of parents and at the Flint, Mich., home of Ms. MacLean's
grandmother, Elaine Peterson.
   The search for the couple began when police found their BMW in a
downtown Chicago alley. Investigators noted that some of the
circumstances surrounding their disappearance indicated they had
planned to vanish.
   But families and friends were concerned the couple might have
come to harm, saying they were too responsible to have gone away
without letting loved ones know they were all right.
   MacLean said Wednesday that the couple indicated their car was
found ransacked apparently because it was stolen after they left it
with the keys under the mat.
   As concern spread, police in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana
joined the search.
   The couple were last seen by Mrs. Peterson on April 2, the day
before Easter, as they left her home. They had said they were
having dinner in the city before heading for Swanson's home in
Elgin, about 40 miles from Chicago.
   Friends told police the couple had been saving money for a trip,
and that Ms. MacLean had bought $600 worth of clothes and made
entries in her diary about travel.
   In June, police learned that ``Hidden Hawaii: The Adventurer's
Guide,'' had been checked out March 29 on Swanson's library card,
fueling speculation the couple was missing by choice.
   Swanson had been scheduled to graduate in May. Ms. MacLean, a
junior, was set to graduate in December.

   Crews set backfires with flame throwers Wednesday to protect Old
Faithful from the worst forest fire outbreak at Yellowstone
National Park this century, while wildfires forced hundreds of
people from their homes in South Dakota and Idaho.
   In Alaska, about 1,200 firefighters battled blazes that burned
about 1.3 million acres, an area larger than the state of Delaware,
and strong winds fanned two of the largest fires, officials said.
   Large fires also burned in Arizona, Oregon, Utah and Washington
state.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel flew by helicopter over 10,000
charred acres in Yellowstone's southern areas and told 500
firefighters that he supports the policy of letting naturally
caused wildfires burn unchecked in wilderness areas unless they
endanger buildings, people or roads. The so-called prescribed fires
are believed to eliminate dead and diseased timber and stimulate
new growth.
   ``We aren't going to waste our resources where fires aren't
doing harm to the park,'' he said. ``There is a long-term
beneficial effect from fire.''
   Later, Hodel appeared to hint at a more aggressive stance
because of the dry conditions in the area.
   ``The problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or
when you have a fire you want to fight,'' Hodel said. ``In the dry
conditions, they're taking the view that any fire that begins they
will try to fight it.''
   But Ben Clary, Yellowstone assistant superintendent, said park
officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires.
   ``We'll evaluate each one,'' he said. ``If it's one log and you
don't want it to go anywhere else, you don't want to waste the
effort and the manpower. But if it's in the middle of the forest
and has the potential, we certainly don't need to have additional
fronts to work on at this point.''
   Crews took an active role against a 9,700-acre fire burning
within six miles of Old Faithful, the park's most famous attraction.
   Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters started
backfires in meadows to direct the blaze away from the geyser and
nearby structures. They hope the backfires will exhaust fuel ahead
of the fire's eastern and northeastern edges and prevent it from
spreading to Old Faithful.
   Bruce Fox, a fire information officer at Yellowstone, said 1,000
acres had been burned intentionally by Wednesday evening and
firefighters were optimistic that the tactic would succeed.
   ``While we haven't had a chance to evaluate it, we are being
told it is going as planned and people seem very upbeat on what is
going on out there,'' he said.
   Three pumper trucks were parked at Old Faithful to provide fire
protection if necessary.
   In all, about 83,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres have
been blackened by fires. An unusually hot, dry summer has left
Yellowstone and the rest of northwestern Wyoming parched.
   ``The last time they had this much fire in the park was in the
late 1800s,'' said Larry Caplinger, a Forest Service official
coordinating firefighting.
   Arson was blamed for a forest fire that burned 2,000 acres
outside Rapid City, S.D., destroyed at least seven houses and
forced the evacuation of over 2,000 people, said Tom Draper of the
state Division of Forestry. The blaze also burned four vehicles and
15 outbuildings, including garages, sheds and barns.
   An estimated 575 firefighters had the blaze 70 percent contained
earlier Wednesday, but winds fanned the flames and reduced the
containment figure to 50 percent. One firefighter suffered a burned
neck and a resident suffered smoke inhalation. Another person was
hurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident.
   Fire incident commander Don Kopp said the blaze, which was first
reported Tuesday afternoon, may have been started by the arsonist
who is believed to have started about 50 fires since May.
   ``Whoever's doing is, they could burn down half of the Black
Hills if they want,'' Kopp said.
   A 1,700-acre blaze in Idaho forced two dozen people from their
homes about 35 miles north of Boise and crept toward about 50
homes, but officials said the structures were not threatened.
   About 130 firefighters got a hand from two helicopters toting
water buckets and four air tankers that strafed the flames with
retardant.
   Fire officials imposed strict fire restrictions beginning Friday
throughout drought-parched Idaho south of the Salmon River.
   ``Until we see a major break in the weather, these restrictions
will hopefully minimize new fire starts which could very quickly
threaten life, property and high value resources with potentially
catastrophic results,'' said, Gene Benedict, branch chief for fire
management in the Payette National Forest.
   Alaska's largest fire, 15 miles north of Livengood in the
state's interior, was pushed by winds and grew to 409,000 acres,
said Sue Mitchell, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman. The
fire has been burning since early June.
   Most of the fires in Alaska were burning in remote areas and
were allowed to burn because they posed no threat to people or
property.
   A fire northeast of Mount Rainier National Park in Washington
state quickly spread across 1,200 acres in steep terrain, fanned by
wind and temperatures near 90. More than 800 firefighters battled
the blaze, which closed part of the transcontinental Pacific Crest
Trail and a highway.
   A timely rainstorm and the labors of up to 700 firefighters
contained a 5-day-old, fireworks-caused fire that blackened 1,955
acres in the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area in northeastern
Utah, officials said.
   Firefighters also contained a lightning-sparked wildfire that
burned an estimated 3,400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern
Arizona.

<HEAD>Company Says It Will Pay Fines to Settle Safety Citations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAY, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. said Wednesday it has
agreed to pay an $873,220 fine for hundreds of alleged safety
violations at its strike-torn paper mill here.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration initially
proposed fines totalling $1.3 million but later downgraded some of
its citations for safety violations and reduced the fines, said IP
spokesman Richard White.
   IP promised not to contest the citations, to pay the fines by
Aug. 15 and to correct any remaining violations, but it did not
admit any wrongdoing, company officials said.
   OSHA officials did not comment on the settlement. Ted
Fitzgerald, an OSHA spokesman in Boston, said the agency would
announce its findings Thursday.
   ``In those instances where safety deficiencies were brought to
our attention, we moved swiftly to correct them,'' Jim Thompson,
the mill's resident manager, said in a prepared statement. ``In
fact, an overhwleming majority of the items cited by OSHA have
already been corrected.''
   ``We will continue to do everything possible to ensure we are in
compliance with all state and federal regulations as the safety of
our employees is our highest priority,'' he added.
   Spokesmen for unions representing more than 1,200 IP workers who
have been on strike since June 1987 said they would not comment
until Thursday. The company has continued to run the mill with what
it says are permanent replacement workers.
   The unions went on strike over wages but subsequently have
sought to publicize the alleged safety violations.
   White said OSHA agreed to downgrade the severity of citations
previously categorized as ``willful'' to ``serious.''
   The settlement covers 197 citations for about 1,000 individual
violations found during OSHA inspections in January and June, White
said. That includes 29 citations previously classified as
``willful,'' 122 in the less severe ``serious'' category, 14
``repeat'' citations and 32 listed as ``other.''
   White said the violations were similar to those cited in a
preliminary list released earlier by the striking unions.
   That list cited such things as flammable liquids stored in
unapproved containers, fire extinguishers that were improperly
discharged, unguarded fan blades and oxygen stored with fuel gas.
   The company is appealing a $242,000 fine levied by OSHA last
October for a separate series of safety violations.

   Farmers, equipment suppliers and bankers
eagerly await $6 billion in prospective drought relief for a
depressed farm economy that was just beginning to recover when
Nature pulled out the rug.
   Without the aid, John Schroeder's financial future could be
grim. The farmer estimates that the drought has cut his corn
production by at least 40 percent, and he isn't certain yet how
much damage it has done to his soybeans.
   ``Some bills are due in the fall, and next spring we'll have
another whole round of them,'' said Schroeder, who farms 1,300
acres with his father and brother in northeastern Illinois'
Champaign County.
   In parched central Illinois, banker Bob Behrens thinks the aid
would ease loan repayment problems. Farm equipment dealer Norman
Duitsman hopes it would slow a sales slump. And grain elevator
manager Chuck Kemper believes it could help his fertilizer business.

settlement is near in the 13-year Angolan civil war.
   ``We really are on the threshhold of a political solution,'' he

Fulgencio Batista.
   Castro also said Soviet-style economic and political reforms are
not in store for Cuba, which he said is improving its economic
performance through greater worker discipline.
   The revolutionary leader said Cuban troops can now leave Angola
because they have been victorious on the battlefield but will
remain ``until the last minute'' _ when a peace agreement is signed.
   ``It can't be abrupt,'' he said. ``If the agreement is achieved,
if the agreement is signed, we will proceed to the total withdrawal
of the internationalist force from Angola.''

``scrambling vainly to catch up'' with a rapidly changing airline
industry whose decisions at times are driven by dollars and not
safety, a congressional study said Wednesday.
   The 183-page report by the Office of Technology Assessment
suggests that Congress provide the FAA with additional funds and
press for more inspectors and air traffic controllers as well as
organizational streamlining that places more emphasis on safety.
   Unannounced inspections and periodic in-depth inspections of
both large and small airlines by the FAA ``are indispensable tools
for ensuring public safety'' but currently the FAA doesn't have

   The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent
annual pace from April through June, but rising food, energy and
clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent, its
highest level in almost six years, the government reported
Wednesday.
   Some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation
was signaling the concluding stages of the current long economic
recovery and could well result in a recession some time next year.
The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary
deviation.
   The Commerce Department reported that the growth rate in the
gross national product, the economy's total output of goods and
services, was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent
increase in the first three months of the year.

<HEAD>In Eighty-Eight, Ky., This Is The Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   EIGHTY-EIGHT, Ky. (AP) _ It's '88 in Eighty-Eight, and people
are getting ready to celebrate the odd convergence of a point in
time and a pinpoint on the map.
   The last time Eighty-Eight entered the spotlight was when voters
here cast 88 votes for President Harry Truman and 88 votes for
Thomas Dewey. That earned the town a feature in ``Ripley's Believe
It or Not.''
   Four decades later, this is the year for Eighty-Eight to call
attention to itself again.
   ``The townspeople have really got excited about it,'' said
Rosemary McPherson, owner of the 88 Market and the driving force
behind The Eighty-Eight Celebration set for Sunday.
   ``That's on the eve of the big day,'' said Ms. McPherson,
referring to Aug. 8 _ or 8-8-88.
   There will be a parade, an antique car show, gospel singing, and
arts and crafts offerings.
   The celebration includes a reunion for all who attended the
now-defunct Eighty-Eight School, and a special invitation is going
out to anyone 88 years old.
   It's doubtful there's ever been anything like it in
Eighty-Eight, a picture-postcard village with the market, a tire
company, neat little houses lining a two-lane road and a red brick
church anchoring the town at each end.
   The first hint that Eighty-Eight's time had come was back in
January when collectors sent their New Year's cards to receive the
town's postmark.
   One collector enclosed a note: ``This is your year.''
   Until then, ``I hadn't even thought about it,'' said
postmistress Donnie Sue Bacon.
   Soon, all manner of mail, including about 200 graduation
announcements from students at the University of Southern
California, began arriving for cancellation at Mrs. Bacon's
cubbyhole post office inside Ms. McPherson's store.
   ``I'm happy that they're recognizing us,'' said Mrs. Bacon, 57,
who had to make a concession to the town's sudden vogue. After 31
years of hand-canceling mail, she was trading her ink pad and
rubber stamp for a self-inking postmarker.
   The town attracted other attention as well.
   Daniel T. Gray and Karen Ann Davis of Bowling Green decided to
get married here, and the Rev. Michael Thomason, who performed the
ceremony, recalled the couple was quite specific about the time:
4:28 p.m. on 4-28-88 in Eighty-Eight.
   ``It was just sentimental,'' said the new Mrs. Gray. When the
marriage license was filed, she added, ``the clerk's office thought
the minister put the date where you put the place.''
   Eighty-Eight's 200 or so residents were at first loath to make a
fuss but finally yielded to the times.
   Serious planning for a commemoration got under way in a town
meeting in June at the 88 Market, which is something of an
unofficial community center.
   And Ms. McPherson, whose store already sold everything from baby
food to country hams, has added a special line of merchandise for
the occasion: Eighty-Eight caps and T-shirts.
   ``They've been going like hotcakes,'' she said.
   The first T-shirt was ceremonially presented to local resident
Elsie Billingsley, age 88.
   How did the town get its numerical name?
   The explanation given by some is that it lies 8.8 miles east of
Glasgow, the Barren County seat.
   That's not it, says Bobby Richardson, an Eighty-Eight native and
Glasgow attorney who says he has the authoritative account.
   It begins with Dabnie L. Nunnally, who opened a general store
and stagecoach stop here around 1850 and became the first
postmaster sometime in the late 1860s.
   Needing a name for the place, Nunnally opted for a number
because ``his figures were more legible'' than his handwriting,
said Richardson, who is Nunnally's great-great-grandson.
   To pick the number, Nunnally counted the money in his pocket _
88 cents.
   ``That's the correct version, according to all the older people
in the family who told me,'' said Richardson.
   At some point _ just when isn't clear _ the town's name was
officially spelled out.
   But mail still arrives here sometimes addressed to ``88, Ky.''

   ``Kids, we just can't afford to buy this. We
don't have enough money right now.''
   ``But mom, why don't we go to the bank machine and get some
more?''
   If you're a parent of small children, that sort of exchange most
likely sounds familiar. One of the innumerable tasks of rearing
your offspring in this capitalistic society is to teach them about
money.
   It's a complex subject, of course, intermingling facts with
personal styles and values. It can hardly be taught in a single
lesson.
   And as in many other basic elements of life, children are likely
to gain much of their understanding of money by observing what
their parents do, rather than by listening to what they say.
   Nevertheless, professional advisers on matters of personal
finance say, there are strategies and tools available to help in
the process of teaching about money.
   For instance, suggests the Credit Union National Association,
the back-to-school shopping parents and children do over the next
few weeks can provide a chance to make some points about money
management.
   ``Shopping can teach children about making choices and
separating needs from wants,'' the trade group says.
   ``Start by making a wish list. Then set priorities. Show
children that if you shop without a plan, you're likely to run out
of money before you've bought everything you need.
   ``Next talk about alternatives. Is it better to buy several
moderately priced items or fewer, more expensive items? Will buying
one item mean you can't buy another, or that you'll perhaps have to
wait to buy the other?
   ``After you make the purchases, help your child evaluate them.
For example, you might ask, `Would you buy the item again? Did it
work the way you thought it would?'''
   On a broader scale, what is the best way to teach children what
money is, how it works and and what it can _ and cannot _ do?
   These days, schools are devoting increased time and resources to
the subject. Extensive learning material, some of it even in
comic-book form, is produced by the various Federal Reserve banks
around the country.
   For information about how to get this material, most of which is
available at no charge when requested in single quantities, you can
write or telephone your nerest Federal Reserve bank or branch.
   Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund and discount
brokerage firm, offers a teaching kit titled ``You and Money'' free
to parents. It can be ordered by telephoning 1-800-544-6666 (in
Massachusetts, 617-523-1919 collect).
   Nina Lyvers, a Fidelity spokeswoman, offers assurances that
callers will not encounter sales pitches for the company's products
or be inundated with subsequent mailings of promotional material.
   The kit, which employs such devices as crossword puzzles and
word search grids, stresses these points:
   _Money is an essential resource that gives people
decision-making opportunities.
   _Money is not only earned by working, but also by investing.
   _Economics is the science of how people produce goods and
services, how they distribute them and how they use them.
   _To achieve financial goals, planning and investing are
essential.
   However they go about it, parents who try to teach their
children about money may get an unexpected dividend that often
comes to those in the role of instructor: They may learn a few
things themselves.

   You can always worry about inflation. If it
isn't present in fact, it is as a threat. And while the threat
might be small, it is always magnified by the number of worriers,
which is great.
   Inflation today is both a presence and a threat.
   As a presence, it is relatively minor, running at an annual rate
of about 4 percent in the past year. Relord,
however; relative to the double-digit rates of the 1970s, 4 percent
is indeed small.
   But even at 4 percent a lot of damage can be done. At 4 percent,
for example, ative is a big wa 7 percent savings account earns only 3 percent
in
real terms, but the tax is applied as if it were 7 percent.
   A savings account, by whatever name it is known, therefore
becomes mainly a financial technique for staying afloat rather than
getting ahead. Four percent inflation cuts your dollar in half
within 18 years. Add in taxes, which are always applied to inflated
rather than constant dollars, and the time shrinks.
   Meanwhile, the cost of things you save for, such as an education
for your kids or your own retirement, may have their own private
inflation rate. Health care inflation, for example, sometimes runs
double the overall rate.
   So is 4 percent damaging? It is, if it persists. It is insidious

   It's been more than 50 years since modern
dance pioneers Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey defiantly kicked
off their toe shoes and whirled in bare feet for a tiny Vermont
college audience.
   The revolt against the rigid parameters of ballet that
characterized the movement's earliest days has faded. Indeed,
ballet itself has lost much of its formality over the past four
decades largely due to the late George Balanchine and his influence
on other choreographers.
   ``The war is over,'' said Charles Reinhart, director of the
American Dance Festival. ``The ballet world is more and more
turning to modern choreographers for their creative work.
   ``We need each other, there's no doubt about that.''
   The proof was in the line-up for the recent six-week festival on
the forested campus of Duke University. Outside of New York _ the
nation's dance capital _ the annual event is considered the mecca
of modern dance.
   Virtually every major name associated with modern dance _ from
Martha Graham to Martha Clarke _ has studied, taught or performed
at the festival. More than 300 new works have premiered here, more
than 100 of them since 1969, when Reinhart took over. And thousands
of dance students _ including Betty Ford, Kitty Dukakis and Madonna
_ have studied here.
   At this year's festival, choreographers known for their
collaboration with big-name ballet companies, such as Paul Taylor
and Lar Lubovitch, mixed with experimental and sometimes bizarre
talent.
   ``When I hear, `That isn't dance,' that's when I sit up and take
a look,'' Reinhart said in an interview. Some of his ``far-out''
proteges, such as Twyla Tharp, have gone on to become darlings of
the modern dance world. Tharp was recently named resident
choreographer at American Ballet Theatre.
   This year's event devoted two weeks to revivals of black
American composers' works _ including Pearl Primus' ``Strange
Fruit'' of 1943, an eerie portrayal of a white woman who has just
witnessed a lynching; Donald McKayle's ``Games,'' a dance set to
the chanting of black ghetto children playing a street game; and
works by Talley Beatty and Eleo Pomare.
   The festival also showcased 26 choreographers from China, South
Africa, Nicaragua and other parts of Asia, Africa and Europe who
traded ideas and styles from their own cultures as part of the
International Choreographers Workshop, co-sponsored by the U.S.
Information Agency.
   ``We have to help to interchange (dance styles), because the
world is dying,'' said visiting choreographer Stella Urzua of Chile.
   The world's only festival devoted to modern dance was born in
1934 at Bennington College in Vermont. Martha Graham, Doris
Humphrey, Hanya Holm and Charles Weidman, fed up with the New York
summer heat and the constraints of classical ballet, headed for the
cool New England climate to encourage each other and to start the
revolution.
   They danced in bare feet, gained weight and practiced movements
while lying or sitting on the ground _ all antithetical to the
ethereal world of ballet. They also taught students in order to
support themselves, and at the end of the six-week session
performed only for each other on the campus.
   The festival moved to Connecticut College in New London in 1948.
In 1959, New York City Ballet director George Balanchine
choreographed ``Episodes'' with Martha Graham, using Paul Taylor as
a solo dancer.
   ``That was the beginning of the coming-together,
choreographically, of the two worlds,'' Reinhart said.
   Since moving to Duke University in 1978, the festival has
continued its cautious partnership with classical ballet, while
maintaining the endless battle for funding.
   Raising money to support the festival _ $1.75 million for this
year's operating budget _ is a year-round operation for Reinhart,
his wife, Stephanie, and two staff members at ADF's New York office.
   About 45 percent comes from festival tuition and ticket sales,
with the rest gathered from private corporations, foundations and
individual dance lovers, as well as local governments, Reinhart
said.
   With funding uncertain, the festival's trappings are modest. An
old white frame house shaded by crepe myrtle trees on Duke's East
campus serves as summer headquarters. More than 300 dancers attend
classes and perform in converted classrooms and gymnasiums around
the university _ most of which lack air-conditioning to ward off
the stifling North Carolina heat.
   In a sweltering gymnasium, Betty Jones, a diminutive blonde in
her 60s who helped found the Jose Limon dance troupe, called out
instructions to about 30 muscular men and women in leotards.
   Outside on the campus lawn, more than three dozen dancers in
Chuck Davis' African American Dance class hopped frenetically and
sang the words to an African folk song, while drummers played
African rhythms.
   In a makeshift studio off the university's student union
cafeteria, the sound of clattering dishes competed with a jazz
dance recording.
   Susan Hartley, a 34-year-old dancer from Chapel Hill, tried to
absorb it all.
   ``It's live, breathe and work dance, every hour of the day and
night,'' she said. ``I love it.''

   When creator Gene Roddenberry has a question
about ``Star Trek'' the man he turns to is Richard Arnold.
   The information about ``Star Trek,'' and the lore amassed over
the past 22 years, is so vast that only the most dedicated Trekkie
could possibly keep track of it.
   Arnold has been the show's official archivist at Paramount
Studios for the past two years, but for nearly nine years before
that he was an unpaid but virtually full-time consultant.
   ``I might get a call from a game show asking which cast member
first said, `Beam me up, Scotty,''' said Arnold. ``No one ever said
that on any `Star Trek' episode. The fans made it up, like `Play it
again, Sam.'
   ``I frequently get calls from merchandising and licensing.
They'll want to know what actor played such-and-such a character
and how can they get hold of him to sign a waiver. Television
stations call a lot asking for help in designing a promotion
campaign.''
   Arnold emphasized, however, that he is not the final word on the
show. ``I'm a consultant,'' he said. ``I'm not hanging over
anyone's shoulders. They can consult me or not.''
   ``Star Trek'' made its debut on NBC in 1966 and ran for three
years. It has also been an animated series, four hit motion
pictures have been made and a fifth is in the works, and the new TV
series ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' is an enormous hit in
syndication.
   ``I was 12 years old when `Star Trek' began,'' said Arnold.
``I'd gone through `The Hardy Boys,' even my sisters' `Nancy Drew'
books, and Edgar Rice Burroughs had gotten me into science fiction.
I remember I spent one summer in a tent in the backyard reading. My
mother thought there was something wrong with that.
   ``On TV I'd watched `Lost in Space,' `Voyage To the Bottom of
the Sea,' and `Time Tunnel.' Then `Star Trek' came on. The first
episode intrigued me. The next episode was so good, I cried at the
end. After that I scheduled my life around watching `Star Trek.' I
watched the shows over and over and over again. My mother couldn't
understand that. I asked her if she ever went back to the same
restaurant.''
   His mother, incidentally, finally began watching and was soon an
avid ``Star Trek'' fan herself.
   Arnold, who was born in the same hospital in Vancouver, Canada,
as Jimmy Doohan (Scotty), ran a ``Star Trek'' fan club in high
school and college. He moved from Canada to St. Louis in 1969 and
went to his first science fiction convention with a cousin in
downtown St. Louis.
   ``It changed my whole life,'' he said. ``I went to the first
`Star Trek' convention in New York in 1971. I met Gene Roddenberry
there and he was very kind to me. But I didn't know who he was
until he was introduced at the convention.''
   That was the first of many ``Star Trek'' conventions he was to
attend in following years. In 1974 he moved to Los Angeles to work
as a hospital orderly.
   ``I still kept in touch with everybody, and Susan Sackett,
Gene's assistant, began calling me for information,'' he said.
``She knew my memory of the shows. If there was a question or a
problem they'd call me. Eventually, it got to the point where I had
an office, a parking space and my name in the Paramount studio
directory. And I wasn't even on the payroll.
   ``I kept getting more and more calls. From publicity, from
merchandising, from everybody. I was spending nearly all my time at
the studio. Finally, Gene proposed establishment of the job of
archivist and I went to work on July 1, 1986.''
   It's a job that you'd think would make Arnold the envy of every
Trekkie. But Arnold said they're such a compatible group that they
help each other out. He frequently calls on other Trekkies when
he's stumped.
   ``I'll call Denise Tathwell if I need to know dialogue from the
first 79 episodes or the movies,'' he said. ``Richard Barnett knows
all about the toys and memorabilia. Guy Vardaman, who works on the
new series as a stand-in, knows the dialogue better than I do. And
he's worked with a lot of the guest stars.''
   Arnold also turns out the best-selling ``Star Trek'' calendars
for Pocket Books.
   Next up is the fifth ``Star Trek'' movie, which was postponed
when Leonard Nimoy accepted an offer from Disney to direct Diane
Keaton and Jason Robards in ``The Good Mother.''
   The tentative start date for ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''
is Sept. 12. William Shatner will direct. Harve Bennett will
produce.
   ``I think they'll keep making the movies as long as the original
seven cast members want to,'' he said. ``Leonard is becoming very
hot as a director and that could affect his availability. It's such
an ensemble cast that if one actor was lost for any reason I don't
know if the other actors would want to go on or how the fans would
accept it.''

<HEAD>New Leadership Seeks to Change Course for Taiwan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS in lead that Chiang's family dominated Kuomintang
for half-century, not 94 years; SUBS graf 7, ``President Lee, to
include date of Chiang's election as head of Kuomintang</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After half a century in the grip of Chiang
Kai-shek and his family, the long-ruling Nationalist Party has a
new leadership that hopes to steer Taiwan from the authoritarian
and uncompromising ways of its past.
   The changes at the top and in direction came at the party's
recent 13th congress in Taipei.
   Ever since the government of Chiang Kai-shek was driven to
Taiwan from mainland China in 1949 by Mao Tse-tung's Communists,
the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, has been consumed by an
undying dream of returning to govern the world's most populous
nation.
   While the congress vowed to keep that dream alive, it cautiously
acknowledged the need to replace its aging party elders who date
from the Chiang days on the mainland to a more dynamic leadership
aware of the need for democratic change at home and pragmatism in
dealing with mainland China.
   The new thinking comes as the mainland Chinese have been making
radical changes of their own, including overtures to Taiwan for a
one-nation, two-systems type of arrangement they made with the
British on capitalist Hong Kong.
   The Nationalist Party's new leadership unveiled at the congress
clearly showed power is shifting to native Taiwanese, who
constitute 85 percent of this prosperous island's nearly 20 million
people.
   President Lee Teng-hui was acclaimed the first native Taiwanese
leader of the party. That helped consolidate his power base that
was virtually non-existent when he succeeded Chiang Ching-kuo, the
eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, as head of government upon his death
in January. The elder Chiang, who was elected head of the party in
1938, died in 1975.
   The party's policy-making Central Standing Committee, long
dominated by mainland Chinese, for the first time has a native
Taiwanese majority.
   Giving more power to native Taiwanese was part of a sweeping
liberalization program that began with Chiang Ching-kuo, the final
ruler of the Chiang family dynasty.
   Shortly before his death, Chiang Ching-Kuo lifted martial law,
allowed the formation of opposition political parties and ended a
38-year ban on travel to China to allow family reunions.
   President Lee has promised to continue the liberalization
process but may proceed with caution since his new 31-member
Central Standing Committee still contains some party elders who
remain unenthusiastic about a quick pace of change.
   ``We don't believe drastic change will benefit society,'' the
party's 38-year-old deputy-secretary general, Ma Ying-jeou, told
reporters at the end of the congress.
   The major unresolved political issue is overhauling the
parliamentary system in which aging Nationalists elected in
mainland China before 1949 hold a majority of seats as a symbol of
the party's claim to rule the country.
   In the Legislative Yuan, the highest lawmaking body, the Old
Guard has an advantage of about 2-to-1 over Taiwan-elected
legislators.
   Ma said that through retirement of party elders and an increase
in the number of seats contested on the island, the ratio of
holdovers to Taiwan-elected lawmakers should be about equal after
elections in late 1989.
   After another three years, Taiwan-elected representatives should
hold a 2-to-1 edge, he said.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, however, has staged
street demonstrations in support of opening all seats to elections,
actions that elicited expressions of caution from the Nationalists
on the need to maintain law and order.
   Under pressure from the new generation of leaders, the party
congress adopted a more practical approach to dealing with the
mainland. Ma described the new policy as providing ``much more
flexibility to what we had been doing before.''
   The Kuomintang, which once sent ballons across the Taiwan Strait
with handbills urging an uprising against ``Communist bandits,''
now will try to influence their compatriots by taking the ``Taiwan
experience'' of economic prosperity and growing democracy to China.
   The ban on travel to Taiwan from China also has been eased. The
Nationalists also will tolerate imports of Chinese raw material and
the export of Taiwan investment to the mainland so long as the
business is conducted through a third country.
   ``There is no way we can control indirect investment, as well as
indirect trade,'' Ma said.
   The point of the new flexibility, according to the policy
statement, is ``to utilize our political and economic influence to
win the support of our mainland compatriots.''
   The changing face of the Kuomintang prompted a leading member of
Taiwan's opposition party to acknowledge the ruling party's new
dynamism.
   Huang Huang-hsiung, a lawmaker from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, acknowledged that his party ``is facing a new
challenge from the restructured Kuomintang.''
   ``But I believe the condition is better for democratization
now,'' he said. ``We can better pressure them to compete with us on
equal footing.''

<HEAD>Author Alice Hoffman Talks About `That AIDS Novel'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alice Hoffman calls ``At Risk,'' her seventh
work of fiction, ``another very small domestic book.'' Everybody
else in the publishing industry is calling it ``that AIDS novel.''
   Even before publication, 20th Century Fox snapped up the film
rights to ``that AIDS novel'' and the Book-of-the-Month Club made
it a Main Selection. Hoffman's publisher, G.P. Putnam's Sons, has
run off a first printing of 100,000 copies and is spending $100,000
to promote ``At Risk'' _ the kind of publicity campaign usually
reserved for authors who trade bon mots on the talk show circuit or
write diet and exercise books.
   Hoffman was recently in New York to discuss ``At Risk,''
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and why such topical subject
matter is often considered the kiss of death for so-called
``literary fiction.''
   ``I think some critics, for reasons I don't truly understand,
feel that a writer shouldn't write about something that's topical _
that there's news and there's literature, and the two have nothing
to do with each other,'' said Hoffman, whose ``Illumination
Night,'' ``Fortune's Daughter'' and other works have firmly
established her as a ``serious'' writer.
   ``I think that I always write about issues. `White Horses' (her
fourth novel) is about incest; my last book (`Illumination Night')
is about agoraphobia,'' she said. ``I think it just so happens that
what I was obsessed with was what a lot of other people are
obsessed with. I think that's why `At Risk' is getting more of a
reaction than anything I've done before.
   ``I really wrote it for myself; I really thought it was this
very small domestic book. ... It seems to me amazing that there
aren't more books about AIDS, because I think there are so many
different stories to tell.''
   The story Hoffman has chosen to tell is of the Farrells, a
painstakingly normal New England family whose world collapses with
the discovery that 11-year-old Amanda has contracted AIDS from a
blood transfusion. While she battles ostracism from her classmates
and struggles for small victories in gym meets, her parents, Ivan
and Polly, retreat from one another and her 8-year-old brother,
Charlie, languishes from neglect.
   Hoffman was asked why she opted to have a character get the
disease through a blood transfusion, a rare occurrence even before
blood was routinely screened for AIDS.
   ``I wrote about the thing I know the best, the thing that I'm
most enmeshed in right now, and that's family life,'' said Hoffman
who has two sons, Jake, 5, and Zack, 4 months.
   ``I imagined how I would feel if my kid was in school with
somebody with AIDS, especially at the preschool level. I felt
fearful. I knew it was irrational; I knew it made no sense, and in
a way this book was a personal way of working that out.''
   She said her approach highlights the universality of the AIDS
problem by giving the disease to a child instead of to a homosexual
male. ``AIDS is not a gay disease and to look at it that way is
very dangerous and really destructive,'' Hoffman said.
   Writing a book in which a central character suffers from a fatal
disease smacks of potboilerdom, but Hoffman's rich and imagistic
prose saves ``At Risk'' from becoming maudlin. She was asked if she
found herself fighting sentimentality.
   ``I don't think I fight sentimentality,'' she said quickly,
laughing. ``I don't think I'm sentimental, but I'm definitely
emotional. I think sometimes those two things are thought of as the
same thing. I also think that a lot of times what women are
sometimes more interested in is thought of as sentimental, as less
important _ things like families and children, emotional
entanglements, that kind of thing.''
   Hoffman, 36, grew up on New York's Long Island and attended
Adelphi University before earning her master's degree from Stanford
University's prestigious creative writing program. She has been
writing and publishing steadily since then, living in ``a big old
falling-down house'' outside of Boston with her husband and two
children.
   Since moving to that area about eight years ago, she has written
one or two screenplays a year. Only one has been made into a
commercially released film (``Independence Day''), but the pay is
still lucrative enough that her husband, Tom Martin, quit his
teaching job to work at home with her on the projects. She has
already completed the screenplay for ``At Risk,'' although
production has not begun on it.
   The writer's strike has idled her screenwriting for now, and she
has not started work on her next novel. What, then, is she working
on these days?
   She smiled. ``Birth announcements.''

   A papal edict that caused an upheaval in Roman
Catholicism was commemorated this week. American bishops saluted it
for ``prophetic wisdom,'' but recognized obstacles to it.
   The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the late Pope Paul VI's
1968 encyclical ``Humanae Vitae,'' ``Of Human Life,'' which
reaffirmed the church's ban on contraception, and set off a church
storm.
   Repercussions still linger in the widescale Catholic rejection
of the particular prohibition and, as seen by some scholars, in the
spread of dissent to other areas of church teaching.
   In this country and elsewhere, the event catalyzed a searching
examination of Catholic rights of conscience, and debate over it
still goes on.
   The enclyclical, asserting an inseparable link between the
unifying and reproductive dimensions of sexual intercourse, said it
always ``must remain open to the transmission of life.''
   Despite continuing resistance to the rule, bishops and some
Catholic groups paid tribute to it. Also, a new study gave a
positive assessment of the church's only approved way of limiting
pregnancies _ natural family planning.
   This involves charting the wife's period of fertility and
avoiding intercourse during it. In responses from 3,763 couples
using the method, 70 percent found it satisfactory.
   ``The results verify that couples who are properly instructed
and well-disposed find natural methods satisfactory and
effective,'' said Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, head of the
bishops' pro-life committee.
   It was the first such nationwide study of its kind, with answers
to questionnaires gathered from couples instructed in the use of
natural methods in 24 diocesan programs across the country.
   The study, funded by the Knights of Columbus, a national
Catholic fraternal organization, found that two-thirds of the
husbands and wives consider it important to be ``in conformity with
church teaching'' in their sex lives.
   Only about 10 percent reported unintended pregnancies in the
past year.
   ``The results are highly encouraging,'' said Auxiliary Bishop
James T. McHugh of Newark, N.J., director of the church's Diocesan
Development Program for Natural Family Planning.
   However, as indicated by numerous surveys over the past decade,
large majorities of Catholics, generally found at more than 70
percent and ranging up to 90 percent, disagree with the church's
ban on contraception.
   That situation, multiplying into dissent on other church fronts,
burst widely after the promulgation on July 29, 1968, of ``Humanae
Vitae.''
   It generated public dissent from about 650 American Catholic
theologians, including most of some faculties, and created
prolonged turmoil in Washington between priests and the late
Cardinal Patrick O`Boyle.
   Several national hierarchies _ in Canada, Belgium, Austria, West
Germany and elswhere _ affirmed conscientious decisons about the
issue _ similar to a 1971 Vatican compromise settling the dispute
in Washington.
   Meanwhile, in the early phases of the outcry, U.S. Catholic
bishops in 1968 issued a statement recognizing rights of
responsible theological dissent.
   But in 1986 this was repudiated as ``unworkable'' by
Washington's Archbishop James Hickey, now cardinal-designate, after
the Vatican barred the Rev. Charles Curran, a noted moral
theologian, from teaching theology.
   He dissented from various church sexual teachings, including
bans on contraception and divorce.
   Paul VI's controversial encyclical came in the wake of the
1962-65 Second Vatican Council, from which he had removed the
issue. To study it, he set up a broad commission of scientitific
and religious scholars.
   Its strong majority recommended dropping the contraception ban,
and Paul's reassertion of it hit like a thunderclap.
   He attributed resulting difficulties largely to ``a certain
climate of expectation which had given rise, among Catholics and in
the wider circle of public opinion, to the idea of presumed
concessions...''
   Twenty years later, the U.S. bishops' Committee for Pro-Life
Activities said ``we see ever more clearly the prophetic wisdom''
of the church's position and ``the courage of Pope Paul VI in
reaffirming'' it.
   At the time he did so, they said, the birth-control pill was
relatively new and people ``were still reeling from the `sexual
revolution' of the 1960's... Today's climate is different again.
   ``Looking back over the past 20 years ..., we can see a gradual
decline in family size and an increase in divorce, both notably
pronounced among Catholics, and an overwhelming assault on the
sacredness of human life in judicial decisions and social policies
regarding abortion.
   ``We find in our society a growing ambivalence regarding
children, and an increasing tendency to equate the bond of marriage
with mere cohabitation.''
   Against these tendencies, the bishops said, adherence to the
church's teaching against contraception helps married couples
develop sensitivities to each other's needs that ``solidify the
marriage relationship.
   ``Efforts to live their sexuality in accord with the teaching of
the church brings to married couples peace of mind and conscience.
It also deepens their faith and affirms their reliance on God's
providential care...''

   Political differences exist among
evangelical voters, but they're united on several issues, such as
favoring voluntary school prayer and opposing most abortions, a
poll finds.
   The evangelical fortnightly, Christianity Today, says responses
from 401 of 749 subscribers surveyed found that 74 percent want
creationism taught along with evolution in public schools, and 82
percent favor voluntary school prayer.
   Seventy-six percent support a constitutional amendment banning
abortion except to save the life of the mother, and 86 percent
oppose school-based health clincis that distribute contraceptives.
   On defense matters, 61 percent oppose increased defense
spending, and 72 percent support more nuclear disarmament treaties
with the Soviet Union.

   An American priest who heads the Catholic
Traditionalist Movement says it will continue fighting to retain
the old Tridentine Latin Mass, but will avoid ``both heresy on the
left and schism on the right.''
   The Rev. Gommar A. De Pauw founded the movement in 1964, six
years before Marcel Lefebvre began his traditionalist group in
Econe, Switzerland. Lefebvre was excommunicated June 30 for
ordaining four followers as bishops.
   De Pauw, who leads the Tridentine Mass for a congregation here,
said, ``I leave it to God and history to pass judgment on both Pope
John Paul II and Archbishop Lefebvre.''

religious parties should not be part of Israeli politics.
   ``The time has come for Israel to adopt the separation of
synagogue and state as practiced in America,'' Rabbi Kassel Abelson
of Minneapolis told a meeting of the Rabbinical Assembly.
   He said Israel's rigidly Orthodox political party is ``more
concerned with its own interests than with the nation and the unity
of the Jewish people.''
   Reform and Conservative rabbis are barred from officiating at
Israeli marriages or funerals, restricted to Orthodox rabbis,
although both other groups have Israeli congregations.
   A poll found a majority of Conservative rabbis favor allowing
civil marriages, now not permitted.

<TEXT>
   Don't be surprised to find a certain lack of
respect for authority in Martin Brest's films: The director is a
bit of a smart aleck himself.
   ``It has to with my upbringing and feeling that I'm on the
outside,'' said Brest. ``I was a sort of wiseguy kind of kid, very
anti-authoritarian. I sort of loved to be indignant to authority.
That seems to be a good thing for the movies.''
   He's directed his share of wiseguys: George Burns in ``Going in
Style''; Eddie Murphy in ``Beverly Hills Cop''; and Robert De Niro
in ``Midnight Run.'' All three films feature someone in trouble
with the law, a theme that dates back to Brest's earliest efforts.
   ``I think about movies I did in (New York University) film
school. Little tiny, short films,'' he said. ``All those films
usually centered around one person who is on the outside and starts
getting involved in some over-ambituous thing to get ahead and
winds up creating a chain reaction.''
   ``Midnight Run'' is Brest's fourth feature film. De Niro stars
as a bounty hunter who will collect $100,000 from his bondsman if
he can bring a bail-jumping accountant from New York to Los Angeles.
   De Niro is going to Los Angeles by plane but changes his plans
when the accountant (Grodin) reveals his fear of flying. The two
instead travel by car, bus, passenger train and box car, pursued by
the FBI, local police, a fellow bounty hunter and the Mafia, from
whom Grodin took $15 million and donated to charity.
   Brest and screenwriter George Gallo created the story.
   ``We were just hanging around talking and he told me about a
friend of his that had to go to New York to pick up a prisoner and
after he got the prisoner on a plane, the guy went nuts and
couldn't fly,'' Brest recalled. ``They had to come across the
United States with different types of transportation.''
   The film required extensive location work, a process that took
its toll on the crew.
   ``Each day the crew is presented with an entirely new set of
problems,'' he said. ``Each time we got to new a place, by the time
we knew the problems and how to deal with them, we had to move to
another place.
   ``Our camera crew quit, our assistant director crew quit. It was
a difficult production.''
   But Brest had more than enough to be thankful for while making
``Midnight Run,'' starting with the actors.
   ``It never occurred to me in a million years that Robert De Niro
would want to do my movie,'' said Brest, still shaking his head in
amazement. ``I couldn't believe it.''
   He recalled one scene in ``Midnight Run'' in which De Niro
visits his ex-wife in Chicago and asks for money.
   ``He asks her what her new husband will think about her giving
him money and she just says, `It'll be OK; he'll understand.' He
says, `Well, that's love.' When he says it, his spine just kind of
collapsed. His posture just collapses in the subtlest way.
   ``I can't picture him thinking, `Well, when this line comes up,
I'll just collapse my spine.' It's just so in character that it
happened and it's so subtle and so powerful that you think, `Where
did this guy think of that?'
   ``That's genius of the highest order when he's doing apparantly
so little.''
   ``Genius'' is a word Brest also uses for Grodin, who the
director described as ``one of the great deadpan humorists.''
   The pairing of the blank-faced Grodin and the intense De Niro
worked out better than Brest had ever imagined.
   ``When I told people I was doing this movie with Robert De Niro
and Charles Grodin, they thought it was the weirdest combination,''
Brest said. ``Once I saw the two of them together, it was
screamingly obvious to me that they were the perfect combination.''
   ``Midnight Run'' centers on the love-hate relationship of De
Niro and Grodin, who are endlessly fighting and making up. The
bantering between male leads can be found in Brest's other features
as well.
   ``I think it all has to do with the fact that when I was growing
up, the things I used to watch on TV that I enjoyed were Laurel and
Hardy movies and `The Honeymooners,''' he said. ``Those are the
things that entertain me more than anything. Having them as sort of
role models.''

   Step aside noh and kabuki, and make way for the
Metropolitan Opera, Zubin Mehta and ``42nd Street.''
   Those familiar names in such Western culture capitals as London
and New York are finding homes in Tokyo.
   ``Japanese people are internationalizing,'' said theater critic
Kenichiro Shirahama. ``From the destruction of war, the country has
rebuilt itself and now become a glittering show business market.''
   The lineup of summer goodies lends weight to the claim, with
Rudolf Nureyev, La Scala and the New York City Ballet among the
many heavyweights bound for Tokyo to appease local hunger pangs for
foreign theater.
   ``It's `event heaven' here,'' said Shirahama, who has also
published several books on Japanese theater.
   For star performers, a Tokyo engagement usually is more than
just stage appearances. Many are given plum TV spots plugging
sponsor products in their contracts.
   ``We even get requests from foreign artists to sponsor them in
Tokyo,'' said Norio Takahashi of the Japan Performing Arts Corp.
``They've recognized the clout Japan holds and the need to succeed
here.''
   For giant corporations, doubling as sponsors for the eager
artists ``is a way of polishing the company name,'' Takahashi said,
though they rarely make profits because of the astronomical costs
and heavy taxes involved.
   Asahi Breweries paid dearly when it sponsored a recent Met tour:
It picked up a tab of $3 million to put the company on stage. But
the amount is small compared to the estimated $17 million needed to
transport Milan's 500-member La Scala opera in September.
   Hefty door prices are inevitable to offset the production costs.
But for the yen-strong Japanese, who still buy if the price is
high, money is no obstacle.
   Peter Brook's ``The Mahabharata,'' for example, was sold out
months in advance despite the $270 ticket price for the nine-hour
play. Choice box seats for two were tagged at $615 each.
   ``Japan is an affluent society,'' said Toshiko Kuronuma,
director of Japan Arts Corp. ``People can afford the high prices
for the tickets.''
   She also said the Japanese people are no longer satisfied with
home productions of opera and ballet and now want to see ``the real
thing.''
   ``Their tastes have gone up,'' Kuronuma said.
   Language is also no handicap for the Japanese audience. The
shows make sure to cater to every need.
   During its tour, the second to Japan but the first in 13 years
outside North America, the Met projected Japanese subtitles on a
small screen above the stage. ``42nd Street,'' meanwhile, made do
with simultaneous interpretation.
   But ``The Phantom of the Opera'' went one step further and was
both translated and adapted for a local theater group, as were
other musicals, including ``Cats,'' ``La Cage aux Folles'' and
``Les Miserables.''
   As for ``The Greatest Show On Earth,'' which made its
international debut last month in northern Sapporo, the singing
American ringmaster is pulling in crowds with shouts of
``subarashii zoo-san, okashii piero'' (``amazing elephants, strange
clowns'') _ after a two-month Japanese-language crash course.
   In order to accommodate the flood of imported productions,
concert and theater halls have been sprouting up all over Tokyo. In
less than three years, more than a dozen have opened their doors,
while about eight more halls will be inaugurated next year.
   Probably the most ambitious to date has been the Tokyo Globe
Theater, a pinkish gray 650-seat structure built at a cost of $15.4
million. It was inaugurated with a performance by the Royal
Shakespeare Company in April. Across town, the Casals Hall,
dedicated to the late cellist Pablo Casals, opened last December.
   The sleek, new Suntory Hall was the site for the Israeli
Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mehta. Seating over 2,000, it
was among the first of the modern music halls to open its doors to
imported artists two years ago.
   The rise in foreign theater has definitely influenced interest
for new halls. ``It's a good feeling to listen to music in pleasant
surroundings,'' Kuronuma said.
   She dismissed criticisms that the Japanese interest in foreign
productions was merely a boom, and said it was even likely to
replace noh and kabuki as the major theater form.
   ``Noh and kabuki appeal to the older generations,'' Kuronuma
said, ``but opera, ballet and the like attract a bigger group of
people, including the young crowd.
   ``With them the trend is toward internationalizing.'' Japanese
theater, she added, is ``too traditional.''

   Dissident Bishop Richard Williamson,
excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church in the church's first
split in 118 years, says Pope John Paul II is wrecking his own job.
   ``He is like a soft drink seller praying for cold weather,''
Williamson says. ``He's going to put himself out of business.''
   Williamson, 48, was ousted from the church at the end of June
after he and three others were consecrated bishops by Rebel
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in a ceremony in Switzerland.
   Pope John Paul II promptly excommunicated him and the four new
bishops, provoking the first major schism in the Roman Catholicism
since 1870. Also ousted was retired Brazilian Bishop Antonio de
Castro who took part in the ceremonies.
   Williamson predicted the ``official church in 10 years will
almost have disappeared.''
   ``The only Catholic church strong will be the Catholics that
keep to the complete faith,'' he said. ``For us the future looks
bright, but for the mainstream church, people will have gone the
modern way and cease to be Catholics.''
   Lefebvre's traditionalist followers are estimated at 100,000 to
500,000 by the Vatican and more than a million by Lefebvre's
headquarters in Econe, Switzerland.
   Lefebvre, 82, denounces church reforms of the 1962-65 Second
Vatican Council, including its affirmation of religious liberty,
ecumenical relations with other Christians and putting the Latin
liturgy into modern languages.
   He charges the church has been ``Protestantized'' and
``democratized.'' He was suspended from functioning in 1976, but
defied it and expanded his movement, ordaining more than 200
priests.
   Consecrating the new bishops brought his ouster and theirs.
   The British-born Williamson, a graduate of Cambridge University,
ran the rebel movement's St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Ridgefield
until it recently moved to Winona, Minn. He plans to stay in
Rdigefield to operate a retreat center there.
   He said Pope John Paul II ``is not understanding of how to
defend the faith in today's world.''
   ``For example, the church is to move with the times, but not
jump in with the times,'' Williamson said in an interview at the
St. Ignatius Retreat House.
   ``If a man with a rope is trying to save a man who is drowning,
he shouldn't jump in with him,'' Williamson said.
   Williamson said it doesn't bother him that his actions are
disapproved by the pope.
   ``If he was a rootin' and tootin' Catholic pope, I'd be all
shook up,'' he said. ``But since he's losing his Catholic way, it
doesn't upset us.''
   The excommunications expel Williamson and the others from the
church and prohibt them from receiving its sacraments.
   ``This pope on his present course will destroy the papacy,''
Williamson said, ``but the Catholic church has the guarantee of the
Lord that it will survive until the end of time, and part of that
is the survival of the papacy.''
   Williamson has not always been a Catholic, nor has he always had
dreams of becoming a priest or bishop. An Anglican, he converted to
Catholicism when he was 30 years old.
   ``I never wanted to be a bishop,'' Williamson said. He added
that he was selected by Lefebvre.
   Williamson said he decided to become a Catholic because, ``I
knew the world was going to hell in a hand basket.''
   He said he ``the Catholic religion is the only answer.''
   Williamson says he plans to travel and admister confirmations
and ordinations.
   ``A number of Catholics don't take this excommunication too
seriously,'' he said.
   He pointed out the pope is considered infallible only ``under
certain circumstances and outside of those he's not infallible.''
   ``The pope has to be speaking as a pope on a matter of faith and
morals with the intention of binding the whole church in a
definitive or defining fashion.'' he said. ``Outside of those
circumstances, he's capable of saying 2 plus 2 is 5.''
   Williamson also denies the ceremony in Switzerland was a schism.
   ``A schism means someone was cut off from the church,'' he said.
``We claim to be very much a part of the church.''
   In another interview with the Long Island Catholic, Williamson
predicted that Rome will ``come back to tradition'' when God uses
the Russians, who ``are on the brink of invading Europe,'' to
chastize the church.
   The pope, fleeing Rome, will then turn to the traditionalists,
Williamson said.
   In response to a question, he agreed with Lefebvre's charge that
the Roman hierarchy is ``doing the work of the anti-Christ.''

   The president of U.S. Conservative rabbis says
religious parties should not be part of Israeli politics.
   ``The time has come for Israel to adopt the separation of
synagogue and state as practiced in America,'' Rabbi Kassel Abelson
of Minneapolis told a meeting of the Rabbinical Assembly.
   He said Israel's rigidly Orthodox political party is ``more
concerned with its own interests than with the nation and the unity
of the Jewish people.''
   Reform and Conservative rab
   The woman, whom he identified in an article published in the
Soviet weekly Literaturnaya Gazetta as Soviet emigre Lyudmila
Thorn, reportedly promised he could have ``all the creature
comforts and joys of life'' if he would go to the United States and
take part in a propaganda campaign against Soviet military
involvement in Afghanistan.
   Ryzhkov told reporters he participated in news conferences at
which he invented Soviet atrocities and claimed to have witnessed
them. Lonely for his family and home, he returned in 1985 knowing
he faced up to 15 years in prison.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, reported July 12 that Ryzhkov had
been freed under the amnesty. He said he appeared at the news
conference Wednesday at his own request ``to help my friends,'' at
least one of whom is still in the United States.
   Literaturnaya Gazetta quoted Ryzhkov as saying his friend,
identified only as Alexander, ``got entangled with the CIA,''
attempted suicide and is now ``ruining himself with drink.''
   The other ex-soldier who appeared at the news conference was
identified as Oleg G. Khlan, who was said to have been taken
prisoner in 1982 and illegally transferred to Britain the following
year. Khlan gave few details of his experience.
   Nikolai Golovin, one soldier who sought refuge in Canada after
being taken prisoner in Afghanistan, returned to the Soviet Union a
week ago to take advantage of the amnesty offer. Golovin did not
appear at the news conference, but a film was shown of him at home
in his village, standing with his mother and swimming with children.

   Harvey Fierstein said he wrote ``Tidy
Endings'' because he wanted to explore the personality of a man who
would fall in love with another man terminally ill with AIDS.
   The short play picks up the story after Collin's death as
Arthur, his lover, and Marion, his former wife, bicker over
division of the estate.
   ``Tidy Endings,'' which Home Box Office will cablecast beginning
Sunday, was the last segment of Fierstein's ``Safe Sex'' trilogy on
Broadway. Fierstein also stars as Arthur and Stockard Channing is
Marion.
   ``It's a drama about a man who's bitter, lost, hurt and
bleeding,'' said Fierstein. ``I had a lot of questions about that
character. I write to explore personalities. I wanted to look at a
man who would fall in love with someone terminally ill.
   ``This is about how he deals with it. There's something very sad
about Arthur. I think he wants everyone to mourn for him and he's
sort of disappointed when people don't. He has a kind of Florence
Nightingale quality. He gives up his job to care for this man.''
   Fierstein was interviewed during a late-evening break on a
location set for the motion picture version of ``Torch Song
Trilogy.'' He won two Tonys for writing and starring in the comedy
on Broadway. It tells the story of Arnold Beckoff, a gay young man
and female impersonator whose homosexuality is driving his Jewish
mother to distraction. Fierstein won a third Tony for writing the
book of the musical ``La Cage Aux Folles.''
   In ``Tidy Endings,'' Marion has gone on with her life. But
Arthur is devastated by the death of Collin.
   ``She had to give the funeral, write the obituary, and now she's
telling Arthur to move out of the apartment,'' said Fierstein.
``She has a problem of letting go as well. I thought of them as two
vultures fighting over the memory of this dead man. These are two
people who should be taking care of each other. They're jealous and
neither can trust that Collin could love them both. That's what
drew me to the story.
   ``I think they're both incredible people. I couldn't do what
either one did. I think they're both heroes, although the death
puts them in their worst light.''
   In the story that spawned the play, Arthur does not begin his
relationship with Collin until the latter is terminally ill. He
also forges a truce of sorts with the young son Collin had with
Marion.
   Fierstein was in his motor home dressing room, which was parked
outside a seedy-looking bar standing in for a gay hangout in New
York. He was preparing for a scene in which he meets his lover,
played by Brian Kerwin. He was in the last days of a two-month
shooting schedule. ``Torch Song Trilogy'' was written in the
worry-free days before AIDS and is played as a period story.
   The movie also stars Anne Bancroft as his mother (Estelle Getty
of ``The Golden Girls'' played the role on Broadway). Matthew
Broderick plays the love of his life, who is killed by a street
gang hunting for gays. Eddie Castrodad is his young adopted gay
son, and Karen Young is the woman Kerwin leaves Arnold for when he
begins to worry about appearances.
   Fierstein is both an actor and a writer, but calls himself an
artist because he doesn't want to be limited. He has a degree in
painting from the Pratt Institute. ``If I never act again, it's
OK,'' he said. ``If I never write again, it's OK. Life's too short.
I always say a murderer is much more forgivable than a person who
is boring.
   ``I had a painting teacher who turned me off painting. I turned
to ceramics. I have a house full of ash trays to prove it. In
college I was writing and painting and acting all at the same
time.''
   Fierstein has also appeared in such movies as ``Garbo Talks,''
``Annie Hall,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon,'' the TV movie ``Apology,''
and narrated the award-winning documentary ``The Life and Times of
Harvey Milk.'' His well-known foghorn voice has also been heard as
Satan in the TV movie ``The Demon Murder Case.''
   He bristles at a question suggesting that playing mostly gays
might be typecasting. ``You wouldn't ask William Hurt if he plays
only straight roles,'' he said. ``I'd much rather play a
homosexual. I know a lot more about it. I happen to think
homosexuality is the norm.''
   Fierstein has also written the book for the musical ``Legs
Diamond,'' very loosely based on the New York gangster. It goes
into rehearsal soon with Peter Allen, who wrote the music and
lyrics, in the title role.
   ``This has almost nothing to do with the real Legs,'' he
explained. ``We are not glamorizing gangsters. We are glamorizing
show business.''

<HEAD>PROFILE '88: ^Dukakis TV Stint Was Valuable Political Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was in Cleveland preparing for
several interviews when he picked up a microphone and announced:
``Good Evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Boston's
historic Faneuil Hall for tonight's segment of `The Advocates.' Our
topic tonight: the horrors of the Vietnam War.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee was simply making a
microphone check, but he also was providing a glimpse back to his
days as a television star, of sorts.
   Ronald Reagan had his ``Death Valley Days'' when he was a
candidate. Dukakis has ``The Advocates.''
   While no one is comparing the Massachusetts governor favorably
to ``the Great Communicator'' in terms of television presence, his
cool and relaxed manner in TV interviews and campaign debates has
been noted.
   The program Dukakis hosted from 1971 to 1973 and from 1978 to
1980 pitted two teams, usually divided along liberal and
conservative lines, against one another to debate topical issues.
   He had little on-air experience before that, but former
executive producer Greg Harney said, ``He took to it like a duck to
water. We spoke to him about looking at that camera lens as if it's
your wife.'' Beyond that, Dukakis needed little coaching, Harney
said.
   The 60-minute program, broadcast on public television from
WGBH-TV studios in Boston, kept Dukakis up to date on major issues.
Also, it helped him develop skills on television that he would
later use successfully as a candidate and a governor.
   ``It was superb training for him,'' said Robert Barum, a
broadcast journalism professor at Boston University who watched
Dukakis from close range as an on-air columnist for public
broadcasting stations.
   ``It wasn't one of those TV programs where all you did was look
at a TelePrompTer,'' Barum said. ``He had to be very fast on his
feet and yet be evenly paced.''
   Dukakis joined the program after an unsuccessful run for
lieutenant governor. It was a period of political planning for
Dukakis, when he was beginning to build the organization that would
win him the governorship four years later.
   Conservative writer Avi Nelson, who appeared on several
programs, said Dukakis' television presence has changed little.
``It was a dry, level performance then and it's a dry level
performance now,'' Nelson said.
   New York media consultant David Garth also appeared on ``The
Advocates.''
   ``He learned very early on that television is a medium of the
economic use of the body and the hands,'' Garth said. ``You don't
have to be jumping all over the stage or the screen to get
attention.''
   Garth said the taped format enabled Dukakis to review his own
performance on the broadcasts each week and to work slowly to
improve. But Garth, who worked for Dukakis' Democratic rival Albert
Gore in the New York primary, said that not all of Dukakis'
experience could be carried over to a campaign.
   ``Some of those dynamics change when you become the total focus
rather than the man in the middle,'' Garth said. In speeches and
debates, he finds Dukakis ``a little bit too much under control,''
and he is annoyed by Dukakis' frequent tucked-in-thumb hand
gestures.
   Dukakis took two years to decide whether to seek office again
after his failed bid for reelection in 1978. He needed only weeks
to decide to go back on the air as moderator of ``The Advocates.''
   ``While I regret the circumstances that allow me to be here,
it's good to be back,'' Dukakis told his audience. He said of his
return performance, ``It's amazing how fast you settle back in. ...
Being governor didn't hurt.''
   The Emmy Award-winning program was presented in a courtroom
format. Two teams of ``advocates'' faced off over an issue. Each
team had an attorney-like figure and several witnesses. Teams were
allowed to cross-examine the opposing witnesses.
   ``The Advocates'' was one of the most popular offerings on
public television, second only to ``Masterpiece Theater'' at the
time in the number of public television stations which picked up
the program. One Nielsen survey indicated that 3.6 million homes
tuned in to at least one broadcast of The Advocates per month in
1971.
   Throughout the programs on such topics as SALT II, OPEC oil, and
Vietnamese refugees, Dukakis seemed to side with the audience in
almost a Ted Koppel-like role, asking witnesses to explain arcane
or technical words in everyday language. He appeared clipped, sober
and straightforward, yet his demeanor seemed more relaxed than his
typical gubernatorial appearance.
   At one point during a debate on nuclear power, for example, a
witness kept referring to ``quads'' of energy. ``Could you tell us
lay people what that is?'' Dukakis asked. When the response was,
``It's a million billion British thermal units,'' Dukakis
translated, ``It's a lot of power.''
   Former network correspondent Marvin Kalb, who directs the press
and public policy center at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,
said the experience seems to have made Dukakis about even in
television effectiveness with George Bush, his future opponent in
the the presidential election.
   Bush, Kalb said, listens too much to his advisers who would be
better to ``let Bush be Bush.'' Dukakis ``has a way of clipping off
the end of a sentence. His voice runs down and he repeats
phrases,'' according to Kalb. ``Neither one is God's gift to
television.''

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods advanced in June at their fastest pace in 30 months,
an 8.8 percent increase that was propelled by heavy demand for new
commercial aircraft, the government reported.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that orders for durable
goods, items expected to last at least three years, totaled $125.23
billion last month, $10.14 billion higher than the May total.
   The June increase was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent

they were negotiated, generally two to three years ago.
   While the report on collective bargaining agreements indicated
no rise in inflationary pressures, another report covering both

   At a news conference Tuesday, the heads of five state banking
associations and an official from a national organization of state

   The bill grants banks new securities powers. But it includes
requirements for serving poor consumers that banks consider too

   The chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, won quick approval of
the bill Tuesday by promising colleagues that the committee staff
would attempt to put together a separate package of their favorite

   That package likely would include amendments to permanently free

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say IBM's fourth-quarter earnings could
benefit from its new series of mainframe computers, which are 25
percent to 50 percent more powerful _ and up to 15 percent more
expensive _ than their predecessors.
   International Business Machines Corp. on Tuesday unveiled the
new machines, which are the latest version of the company's 3090
series that debuted in 1985.
   The 10 models in the Enterprise System-3090 S series are led by
the model 600-S, which IBM called ``the industry's most powerful
general purpose processor.'' It has 56 percent more processing
power than its preceding model.
   The new machines range in price from $985,000 for the basic
120-S model, which will be available in September, to $12.4 million
for the most powerful 600-S model, which will be available in the
fourth quarter.
   Analysts said that although the new machines were priced between
10 percent and 15 percent more than preceding models, they welcomed
the increase because of the positive effect it would have on
overall future earnings.
   ``In the past IBM had been pushing prices down very aggressively
while looking for volume to offset (the increase), and they had
been disappointed,'' said Stephen Cohen, analyst at Gartner
Securities Corp. in Stamford, Conn.
   But computer users have been more interested in a product's
performance. ``It appears IBM has been getting that message, and
this is clear evidence they are focusing more on performance than
price,'' Cohen said.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, IBM gained 25 cents to close at
$122.62{ a share in composite trading.
   While analysts had been predicting strong earnings in the fourth
quarter, they said the latest announcement solidified those
predictions.
   Mainframe and peripheral products account for about half of
IBM's total revenue. ``If this announcement had not come, the
earnings estimates would have been down dramatically,'' Cohen said.
   The new products had been expected widely in the industry.
Analysts said IBM's mainframe orders had dropped off dramatically
in the past few months as customers held off making decisions until
the new products were announced.
   James Cannavino, vice president and president of the data
systems division, said demand for the new series ``will be very
strong. We have talked to a lot of customers already, and they are
anticipating it.''
   He said he expected orders to begin coming in within the next
few weeks.
   Irving Wladawsky-Berger, vice president of IBM's data systems
division, said the new mainframes would help customers reduce the
number of people needed to manage data as well as cut the cost of
manufacturing.
   The new models offer faster high-volume transaction processing,
as with credit card checks or airline reservations, and have
scientific and technical applications as in aerospace design.
   More than 67 upgrade options are available in the series. From
the basic system, the customer has 67 different ways to increase
capacity.
   In addition to the new mainframes, IBM said its MVS-ESA
operating system is available, a month ahead of schedule. This
operating system can be used with the 3090-E models as well as new
S models.
   The company also announced an improvement offering higher
performance levels for customers who use the computers for
numerically intensive work, such as weather forecasting and oil
exploration.

<HEAD>Feds Accuse Attorney Of Racketeering Violations In Insider Trading
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, federal prosecutors have
brought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insider
trading and said they would use the law more in the future to crack
down on financial wrongdoing.
   Attorney Alfred Elliott was one of 12 people indicted Tuesday by
a federal grand jury for alleged financial crimes.
   ``This is the first time in history we've used the racketeering
statute in an insider trading case,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas.
   Elliott, now of Melbourne Beach, Fla., was accused of making
$680,000 in illegal profits by using information he obtained when
he was a partner of the Schiff, Hardin & Waite law firm in Chicago.
   ``He misappropriated the confidential information of his firm
and of the clients,'' said Valukas.
   On nine occasions, Elliott learned of large pending stock
acquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in the company whose
stock was being bought, the government alleged.
   The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and gives
the government greater power to seize illicit gains than other laws
prohibiting insider trading, Valukas said.
   ``In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as a
powerful weapon in these cases,'' Valukas said.
   Elliott is charged in the 70-count indictment with wire fraud,
securities fraud, racketeering and filing a false income tax
return. If convicted on all counts, he could be fined $13.5 million
and forced to make restitution of any illegal profits.
   Elliott, 44, could not be located for comment. Directory
assistance for Melbourne Beach had no listing for him and his
former law firm said it had no knowledge of his whereabouts.
   Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday were accused in a
separate $1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, a practice of
brokers trading on customers' accounts merely to generate
commissions.
   Valukas said none of the 120 customers involved ever made a
profit.
   The government alleged the scheme was carried out by officers
and employees of Whitehall Investors International Inc., based in
Chicago with branches in Irvine, Calif., and Boca Raton, Fla.
   Those indicted include Walter S. Josten, an owner and president
of Whitehall, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted.
   Josten's last known residence was in Los Angeles, but directory
assistance had no listing for him.
   Indictments also were returned against three people in an
ongoing investigation of trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   They are accused of participating in fraudulent trading
involving Jeffrey G. Donnelly, a former broker with CRT Services
Inc. Donnelly pleaded guilty of two counts of fraud in February and
was sentenced to three years in prison.
   The government said Donnelly would take successful trades he
executed for his company and make it appear that the trades had
been made for one of the three independent traders indicted on
Tuesday.
   Valukas said more than $700,000 was diverted illegally to the
defendants, while Donnelly got a 35 percent cut.
   Indicted were Denise Bigelow, 29, who the government said had
$142,500 illegally diverted to her account; John D. Riss, 29,
$390,727; and Paul M. Kelly, 35, $180,000. All are from the Chicago
area.
   Conviction would carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence and a
$750,000 fine.

<HEAD>China's Foreign Trade Up Sharply in First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's foreign trade in the first half of 1988
increased by almost 20 percent over the same period last year, led
by sharp jumps in trade with Hong Kong and the United States, the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade said Wednesday.
   Ministry spokesman Liu Xiangdong told a news conference that
total trade was $35.8 billion, up 19.5 percent above last year.
Exports were up 16.1 percent to $20.2 billion and imports climbed
24.3 percent to $15.6 billion.
   Liu said China's foreign trade was ``stable and healthy'' and
``demonstrated good prospects of a smooth transition from the old
system to the new.''
   China is decentralizing controls over its foreign trade, and is
trying to develop export industries while confining imports to
machinery and high technology items that will help in the nation's
modernization drive.
   Liu said that through May, China's trade with the United States
was $2.9 billion, up 26.3 percent from the first five months of
1987.
   Trade totalled about $7.5 billion with the Hong Kong region
during that time, up 35.5 percent; $5.5 billion with Japan, up 8
percent; $3.8 billion with the European Community, up 3.5 percent;
and $1 billion with the Soviet Union, up 32.1 percent.
   The ministry's figures differed from those released earlier this
month by the Customs Office, which showed China with a trade
deficit of slightly more than $1 billion on total trade of $43.2
billion.
   Liu said the two offices calculated differently the goods
imported and then processed for export. He said the ministry does
not include imports of equipment by foreign-funded enterprises
which will be used to produce goods for export.
   Foreign investment jumped by 186 percent in the first half
compared with last year, with the approval of 2,109 foreign-funded
enterprises, Liu said. The value of those contracts was $2 billion,
up 130 percent, he said.
   He said U.S.-invested projects jumped to 85 this year from 34
last year.
   Hong Kong continued leading foreign investors with 79 percent of
projects and 67 percent of money invested.
   Foreign-invested companies in China exported $570 million worth
of goods in the first half of the year, up 133 percent, Liu said.

   The dollar rose today against major currencies in
slow European trading as dealers waited for the release of U.S. and
British economic reports.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said players were unwilling to take new
positions ahead of the release later today of reports on British

the second quarter.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7115, compared
with $1.7135 Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8640 West German marks, up from 1.8600; 1.5495
Swiss francs, up from 1.5455; 6.2770 French francs, up from 6.2670;
2.0948 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0975; 1,374.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,374.50; 1.2090 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2083.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 132.50 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.75 yen.
   Gold, which has seesawed in a narrow range this week, was mixed
in European trading and traders said its ups and downs were
expected to continue until the market gets a clearer indication of
world inflation trends.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.10 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $433.50. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$430.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $431.60, up slightly from $431.50
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $432.34,
unchanged from Tuesday's closing bid price.
   Later, silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.92 a
troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $7.01.

   The dollar gained slightly today while share prices
soared in active trading as traders awaited the release of U.S.
gross national product figures for the second quarter.
   The dollar opened at 132.50 yen and traded between 132.37 yen
and 132.65 yen before moving back to 132.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Tuesday's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
120.23 points the previous day, surged 434.81 points, or 1.59
percent, to close at 27,738.57.
   Today's gain was the second-best this year. A 513.09-point spurt
was recorded July 19.
   Volume of the first section totaled 1.3 billion shares, compared
to Tuesday's 900 million shares.
   Construction, real estate and electrical shares led the rise.
   ``The dollar and share prices were supported by market
expectations that the U.S. GNP data would show a solid performance
of its economy,'' said one dealer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The gross national product is the total retail value of the
goods and services produced by a nation's economy in a given period.
   Share prices were firm and trading was helped by a burst of
activity prompted by the first day of trading for the August
account, dealers said.
   Today's transactions will be settled four trading days later on
Monday _ Aug. 1. The first day of trading for a new month's account
usually attracts buyers.

<HEAD>Deficit Narrows in June, But Improvement Is Below Expectations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed 7
percent to 1.52 billion pounds, or $2.6 billion, in June, the
government said Wednesday.
   The improvement was below market expectations, and the pound
tumbled on the news.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a revised deficit
of 1.64 billion pounds in May and a deficit of 793 million pounds
in June 1987, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Britain's current account deficit, which includes ``invisible''
trade, narrowed 11 percent to 1.02 billion pounds in June from a
revised deficit of 1.14 billion pounds in May. This deficit stood
at 93 million pounds in June 1987.
   Last month's trade in invisible items, which covers services,
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments, was
estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds.
   The department previously reported May's trade deficit as 1.71
billion pounds and the current account deficit as 1.21 billion
pounds.
   Market forecasts had called for a June trade deficit of 1.3
billion pounds and a current account deficit of 800 million pounds.
   Exports totaled 6.82 billion pounds in June, up from a revised
6.54 billion pounds in May and up from 6.4 billion pounds in June
1987.
   Imports totaled 8.34 billion pounds in June, up from a revised
8.19 billion pounds in May and up from 7.2 billion pounds in June
1987.
   A foreign exchange dealer at major British bank, who wasn't
identified in accordance with British custom, said the pound was
hit by a wave of selling right after the figures were released.
   Shortly after the release of the trade report, the pound was
quoted at $1.7065, compared with $1.7120 just before the
announcement.
   The drop increased fears that interest rates, which have risen
sharply since early June, would go up again. That pressured British
stock prices at midday.
   But the foreign exchange dealer said it was too early to
ascertain if the pound would continue falling.
   Nigel Richardson, an analyst with the London investment firm
Warburg Securities, said: ``These are very disappointing (trade)
numbers. Whether or not the cost of borrowing has to rise depends
on what happens to sterling. Perhaps the markets will ride it out.''
   Sterling has risen in the past few trading sessions on the
country's relatively high interest rates, but market players had
warned that the currency was susceptible to a deterioration of the
country's trade balance.

<HEAD>GNP Registers Healthy Gain But At A Price</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with six graphs to UPDATE with GNP report. Picks up 2nd
graf pvs, But stock ...
^By The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy expanded at an annual 3.1 percent rate during
the second quarter, but with that healthy growth came sharply
higher inflation, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product _ the
broadest measure of economic health _ was off slightly from a 3.4
percent increase in the first three months of the year.
   Inflation, however, picked up substantially during the spring,
with a price index tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of
4.7 percent, the biggest advance since a 5.5 percent rise in the
third quarter of 1982.
   This inflation index, which measures a fixed selection of goods,
had risen 3.5 percent in the first quarter.
   Today's report blamed the pickup in inflation on higher costs
for a wide range of consumer goods.
   In another report Tuesday, the Commerce Department said order to
U.S. factories for durable goods quickened by their fastest pace in
30 months in June, when heavy demand for new aircraft pushed orders
for ``big ticket'' items up 8.8 percent.
   But stock traders, unexcited by Tuesday's report, noted that
much of the increase came in military goods, a category often
subject to wide monthly fluctuations. The stock market struggled to
post a slight gain, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rising 2.14 to 2,073.97.
   In commodities markets, most crop futures prices plummeted in
response to forecasts for continued rain in the Midwest.
   In its durable goods report, the Commerce Department said orders
for items expected to last at least three years totaled $125.23
billion last month, $10.14 billion higher than the May total.
   The June increase, which followed a 1.9 percent decline in May,
was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985
and provided further evidence, analysts said, of the strength in
U.S. manufacturing.
   ``Stripping the fluff away, we are still left with a strong pace
of activity in the durable goods sector,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   On the labor front, the government said that major collective
bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six
months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 2.2
percent a year.
   The Labor Department said this was a slight decline from the 2.9
percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they
were negotiated, generally two to three years ago. The contracts in
the first six months of the year covered 1.02 million workers.
   Separately, most crop futures prices plunged their permitted
daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade following forecasts for
more rain in the Midwest and reports that recent showers had helped
the crops.
   The broad decline marked the seventh straight day of falling
prices for future delivery of soybeans, which closed at their
lowest levels in nearly nine weeks.

   Also contributing to growth in the April-June quarter was a
$14.4 billion rise in consumer spending, which climbed at an annual
rate of 2.3 percent.
   Business investment shot up at a 14 percent annual rate during
the spring as U.S. manufacturers continued to spend heavily to
expand production facilities because of export demands.
   Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second
quarter while imports fell by 6.2 percent.
   Even housing construction showed some strength in the second
quarter, rising by 2.8 percent, partially reversing a 6.5 percent
drop in the first quarter.
   John Wilson, chief economist of Bank of America, said he
believed GNP growth would slow to a rate of 2.5 percent to 3
percent from July through December.
   ``The rise in interest rates that has already occurred will slow
growth in the second half and I am looking for unemployment to rise
a little bit as well,'' he said.
   Christopher Caton, director of forecasting for Data Resources
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm, said he was
looking for the economy to slow, either on its own or because of
inflation-fighting moves on the part of the Federal Reserve.
   ``If the Fed doesn't see some signs that the economy is slowing,
then it will move to push interest rates up farther out of fear
that inflation could get out of hand,'' Caton said.
   John Hagens, an economist at the WEFA Group, another private
forecasting service, said he believed growth would be reduced by
about one-half percentage point in the second half of the year
because of the adverse impact of the drought. He said the higher
prices consumers will have to pay for food will reduce the amount
of income they have to spend on other items.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing in
quiet trading today as traders studied the latest statistics on
economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.95 to 2,075.92 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 376 up, 456 down and
539 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.96 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department said the
nation's gross national product grew at an estimated annual rate of
3.1 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter.
   It also revised its earlier estimate of first-quarter GNP growth
from 3.6 percent to 3.4 percent.
   The latest data were a bit below many advance estimates on Wall
Street, and thus tended to reduce fears that the economy was
growing too fast.
   But brokers said traders were not ewncouraged by accompanying
figures showing inflation at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, up from 1.7 percent in the first three months of
the year.
   Liz Claiborne fell 1\ to 14} as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. Late Tuesday the company reported lower
second-quarter earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .02 to 150.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .47 at 304.17.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 2.14 to
2,073.97.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 765 up, 677 down and 492 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 121.96 million shares, down from 215.14 million in the
previous session and the lightest total since a 116.75
million-share day on June 20.

   Ford Motor Co. today reported profits of
$1.66 billion, or $3.43 a share, as strong international sales
helped the automaker post another world earnings record in the
second quarter.
   The No. 2 automaker said its earnings during the period ended
June 30 rose 11 percent from $1.50 billion, or $2.90 a share,
during the same period last year.
   Sales during the second quarter jumped 14.8 percent to $22.39
billion, from sales of $19.50 billion during the year-ago period.
   Ford said it earned a company record of $760 million outside the
United States, up 23.1 percent from overseas earnings of $536
million during the second quarter of 1987.
   But profits from U.S. operations fell 8.8 percent to $903
million, from $982 million during the same period last year.
   The company said sales incentives, higher material and labor
costs and development of new products depressed domestic earnings.
However, Ford said those costs were offset by reduced manufacturing
costs and a lower tax rate.
   During the three months ended in June, Ford said it increased
its share of the U.S. car market to 22 percent, up 1.4 percentage
points.
   The overall earnings gains come on the heels of record
first-quarter net income of $1.62 billion, or $3.31 per share, on
sales of $20.74 billion. That was up 8.8 percent from $1.49
billion, or $2.87 a share, on first-quarter 1987 sales of $18.14
billion.
   Before Ford's first-quarter earnings were announced, the auto
industry's world earnings record was held by General Motors Corp.,
which posted $1.61 billion in profits during the first quarter of
1984.
   GM last week reported a 29 percent increase in its
second-quarter earnings. The nation's largest automaker posted
profits of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a share, on record sales of $29.9
billion. That was up from $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a share, on
revenue of $26.7 billion during the year-ago period.
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's No. 3 carmaker, is expected to
report its second-quarter earnings Thursday.
   Ford Chairman Harold Poling and President Donald Petersen called
the second-quarter report ``a credit to the Ford team throughout
the world.''
   They also said in a joint statement: ``The geographic diversity
of our operations, as well as our many product and business lines,
provided a broad base for our earnings.''
   For the first half of 1988, Ford earned $3.29 billion, or $6.74
per share, on sales of $43.13 billion, compared with $2.99 billion,
or $5.77 per share, on $37.64 billion in sales during the first six
months of 1987.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating unusual movements in stocks prior to their mention in
upcoming issues of Business Week, the magazine's publisher
confirmed Wednesday.
   Mary McGeachy, a spokeswoman for McGraw-Hill Inc., said the
company was cooperating with the SEC, which is being joined in the
probe by the New York Stock Exchange.
   According to Wednesday editions of The Wall Street Journal, the
American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers are also participating, but McGeachy could not confirm that
claim.
   Late last week the publishing company confirmed that its legal
counsel was investigating suspicious price movements and heavy
trading in stocks mentioned in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column
before Business Week was available to the public.
   While the investigation encompasses McGraw-Hill's entire
operation, some magazine officials believe the information was
leaked by someone unrelated to the editorial staff, such as a
printer at one of the four plants where Business Week is printed,
or a postal worker.
   The magazine's 960,000 weekly issues are printed early Thursday,
released to the press after the market closes that day and to the
general public on Friday.
   Experts had expected McGraw-Hill to team up with the enforcement
operations of stock exchanges and the SEC to trace the leak.
   McGeachy said the magazine plans to include a statement on the
stock activity in this week's issue, due to reach the public on
Friday. The statement is expected to confirm that Business Week is
conducting its own investigation as well as cooperating with
authorities.
   In addition, the statement notes that the magazine's already
``stringent'' internal securities measures have been beefed up.

<HEAD>Business Philosophies Clash in Battle for Savoy Hotel</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savoy, the Edwardian dream hotel on the Thames
that still makes its own mattresses and decorates each room
differently, is under siege from a mass-market predator.
   The seven-year struggle for the flagship Savoy and its five
sister hotels has become a titanic clash of business philosophies
represented by two 79-year-old men.
   Inside the Savoy Hotel PLC is Sir Hugh Wontner, chairman for 36
years and now a director. He is a former lord mayor of London whose
family controls a key 10 percent of Savoy shares.
   Banging at the door is Lord Forte, an Italian immigrant whose
Trusthouse Forte empire claims to be the world's most profitable
hotel and catering company.
   The battle, pitting old guard against the new, is the kind of
lively confrontation that inspired the Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas launched at the adjoining Savoy Theater.
   Wontner is a catering adviser to Buckingham Palace, and, to
borrow a phrase from ``HMS Pinafore,'' he very much remains an
Englishman.
   Trusthouse Forte does the catering at Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Downing Street residence and symbolizes the kind of
swashbuckling entrepreneurship that Mrs. Thatcher deeply admires.
   Wontner's ``upper crust'' credentials contrast sharply with
Forte's hard-driving commercialism. Wontner says quality comes
before profit. Forte says they go hand-in-hand.
   Wontner wrote in a recent circular to shareholders that ``To be
sucked into a vast miscellaneous combine like THF, many people
consider, would be a disaster for our patrons and our staff ...
There can be no need to gratify Lord Forte's ambitions.''
   In his 1987 autobiography, Lord Forte claimed the Savoy was
falling well short of its potential. He said the group's hotels
needed to be refurbished and re-equipped to restore their ``old
glamor.''
   ``They require a massive injection of capital such as we can
provide and which they have not been able to accumulate because of
poor profitability,'' Forte claimed.
   Officials at the Savoy, built in 1889, fear a takeover will
endanger its uniquely English identity, its discretion and personal
service.
   ``You've got a difference of philosophy, a David versus a
Goliath, a small company that is trying very hard not to be part of
a great big one,'' said Giles Shepard, 51, only the fourth managing
director of the Savoy in 99 years. ``I just don't believe they'll
provide quite what we do.''
   Trusthouse Forte promises to double the Savoy's profits in one
year by injecting new money and firing its top management, which it
claims is grossly overpaid.
   ``One of the best hotels in the world ... has been starved of
investment and could be a lot better,'' said Richard Power,
personal assistant to Rocco Forte, the 43-year-old heir and chief
executive. ``We believe that we could make it the best in the
world.''
   The Savoy earned $24 million before taxes last year. Trusthouse
Forte, a 44-nation conglomerate, posted pre-tax profits of $306
million last year from its 800 hotels and 3,000 catering outlets.
   In 1981, Trusthouse Forte captured 69 percent of the ordinary
shares in the Savoy but a complex, two-tier share structure
designed by Wontner to repel takeovers left the company with just
42 percent of voting shares, and no representation in the Savoy
boardroom.
   Trusthouse Forte is suing the Savoy over a 5.7 percent block of
shares it wants canceled. It claims Wontner issued the shares
fraudulently to strengthen his personal control over the Savoy when
he negotiated its only foreign acquisition, the Hotel Lancaster in
Paris, in 1970.
   The suit is expected to reach court this fall, and if Forte
wins, the Wontner group's absolute majority on the board of 50.5
percent will drop to 47 percent and leave the balance of power in
the hands of 2,000 independent shareholders.
   In a vote July 1, a majority of those shareholders voted to
retroactively approve the 5.7 percent share issue, as Wontner had
urged them to do, but Trusthouse Forte is confident they can be won
over.
   Wontner said the shares had been placed in a Swiss foundation to
help hotel trainees. The foundation, which had Wontner, his
daughter and son-in-law on its board, did not declare its
shareholding until October 1986.
   Under British company law, shareholdings in excess of 5 percent
must be declared.
   When it opened, the Savoy was a wonder of the age, with 24-hour
room service, speaking tubes on every floor, and 67 bathrooms at a
time when its most luxurious rival, the Victoria, had just four.
   The hotel still insists on pure linen sheets and towels, keeps
separate kitchens on all seven floors, and decorates each of its
300 rooms individually so that no two are identical.
   Under Trusthouse Forte, Shepard contended, ``I think you'd find
some pictures might disappear off the walls, you'd find nice bits
of furniture would end up in the auction room. Probably a lot of
the reserves of wine in our cellars would be sold and we'd get a
standard wine list.''
   Power denies this, saying: ``We allow places to develop their
own character, and we market them as a collection, not a brand or a
chain.''
   Trusthouse Forte spent $12 million restoring the Ritz in Madrid
to its former splendor and ``we actually have a Rembrandt in the
George V'' in Paris, Power said.
   It owns the Westbury in New York; bought its 19th luxury-grade
hotel, the Eden, in Rome; and for 25 years it has owned family-run
Brown's in London, which Power calls ``the typification of the
English hotel, even more so than the Savoy.''

   Six years after its first product was sketched on
the back of a pancake house napkin, Compaq Computer Corp. continues
to take the computer industry by storm.
   The Houston-based company last year posted sales of $1.2 billion
_ reaching the billion-dollar level faster than any other company
in history and despite the overwhelming presence of industry giant
International Business Machines Corp.
   The company's first product, a portable computer, was the result
of a meeting over coffee involving founders Rod Canion, Bill Murto
and Jim Harris.
   All three worked for Texas Instruments Inc. and were brought
together on a project to start a disk-drive unit. While with Texas
Instruments, the trio decided to venture on their own.
   ``We didn't really realize the fast track we would be on. We
were moving quickly, but we didn't fully understand how big the
potential was,'' said Canion. ``When we were raising our initial
venture capital, we told the investors that we thought $20 million
or $30 million (in sales) the first year was possible and they
laughed. That was unheard of. A company had never started with
their first-year sales that high.''
   Canion and his partners began designing their first personal
computer in February 1982. Sales began in 1983. When the year was
complete, they had tallied sales of $111.2 million, an American
business record.
   Sales in 1984 hit $329 million as the company introduced the
desktop personal computers, which became one of the top-selling
lines of desktop business personal computers within four months.
   In 1985, Compaq climbed into the Fortune 500, making it the
first company to do so in four years.
   Compaq's sales records have continued because its personal
computers are compatible with industry standards, meaning they
support the largest base of business software programs and add-on
equipment.
   In an industry dominated by International Business Machines
Corp., Compaq is playing the role of a modern-day David,
challenging Goliath head to head. IBM has gone on to create a new
standard with its Personal System-2 line, but many customers prefer
to stick with the old one.
   ``I think we're competing very well with IBM,'' says Canion, 43,
company president and chief executive officer.
   Compaq countered an IBM product announcement in June with one of
its own in what some analysts said will protect Compaq's leadership
in the 386-processor personal computer market. The new personal
computers are based on Intel Corp.'s 80386 microprocessor.
   Compaq's Deskpro 386-25 is the world's most powerful personal
computer, according to company spokesman Bob Beach. And the Compaq
Deskpro 386s, Canion's favorite, is the first personal computer to
use a new, cheaper Intel chip.
   IBM announced additional models of its Personal System-2 line,
which included a 25-megahertz 386 machine, but the IBM product
won't be available until September. Compaq machines already have
been shipped.
   Compaq, which already has 1 million square feet of space in six
Houston buildings, in July announced plans for a $137 million
expansion which will add 1.4 million square feet on 85 acres. The
expansion makes room for up to 4,000 more employees, nearly
doubling the present worldwide work force of 4,800.
   ``I kind of like the path we're on,'' Canion said of his
company's performance. ``I don't intend to make any major changes.
We've developed a system for identifying new product opportunities
and then delivering those new products to market quickly.''
   Just last week, the company reported a 91 percent jump in
profits in the second quarter, to $59 million, on sales of $457
million. For the first six months of the year, earnings more than
doubled, to $105 million, on sales of $896 million.
   Michael Davis, an analyst with Lovett Mitchell Webb & Garrison
in Houston, doesn't see Compaq's growth or profits stumbling.
   ``I don't see any clouds in the near-term future. I don't see
any clouds in general,'' said Davis, who follows Compaq's ventures.
   In its third year, Compaq unveiled its Deskpro 286 model and
portable 286 computers. It took IBM nine months to offer a similar
product and by that time, Compaq was enroute to unveiling a
suitcase-size portable. The portable 386 and Deskpro 386-20
computers were introduced in September 1987.
   Eighty percent of the 386-based personal computers sold through
U.S. dealers during 1987 were Compaq personal computers, according
to Storeboard Inc. of Richardson, a consulting company that
provides market information on the computer industry.
   The survey somewhat exaggerates Compaq's share because it misses
IBM's sales through its direct sales force. Compaq only sells its
products through about 3,000 authorized dealers in 40 countries.
   ``They primarily are attuned to the marketplace,'' analyst Davis
said. ``They bring products the public wants and they do well
because they are sold only through dealers. They go to great
lengths to make sure their dealers are happy.''
   Much of the credit for Compaq's success goes to Canion, who has
been responsible for overseeing its record-setting growth in all
operational areas. Canion, who spent 13 years with Texas
Instruments, also is responsible for recruiting high-level
executives from other corporations. He credits Compaq's success to
teamwork among employees.
   ``We were naive in many ways and we stuck with some very basic
philosophies,'' Canion said. ``We didn't have all the answers and
we used the capabilities of everybody to come up with good answers.
... That evolved into our culture.''
   Compaq was named one of the five best-managed companies in 1987
by Business Month magazine.
   ``What carried the day with the judges was not Compaq's
survival, or even the speed with which its sales homed in on the $1
billion mark, but that it accomplished these feats fighting mano a
mano with IBM,'' the magazine said in its December 1987 issue.
   Internationally, Compaq is establishing a network of
manufacturing facilities with a portable and desktop production
plant under construction in Erskine, Scotland, and a
printed-circuit board assembly plant in Singapore, Compaq's first
satellite manufacturing facility outside the United States. The
company's main assembly operations are in Houston.
   Co-founder Harris, who also spent 13 years with Texas
Instruments, oversees the technical group that supports all product
development. He led development of the original Compaq portable
personal computer and was instrumental in engineering the company's
subsequent products.
   Murto directed and coordinated overall sales operations and
marketing before leaving the company in April 1987 to pursue a
religious vocation.
   Compaq's only setback so far came when the company set up a
Dallas-based subsidiary, Telecommunications Corp., in 1984. Its
main product was Telecompaq, which was used to line a telephone and
a computer into a single unit. Production stopped last year after
an investment of more than $20 million, analysts say.
   Despite that stumble, analysts predict Compaq 1988 sales will
increase 25 percent to 40 percent, pushing revenues as high as $1.8
billion.

   Crop futures opened higher today on the Chicago
Board of Trade but corn prices turned lower in early trading.
   Grain and soybean futures were due for a technical rebound after
more than a week of mostly falling prices, said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But he said some speculators have been financially bruised by
the sharp drop in soybean and corn futures over the past week and
many of those investors are scrambling to get out of the grain
markets.
   Meanwhile, the weather outlook turned more bullish today for the
markets with some forecasters reducing the prospects for rain this
weekend in the drought-stricken Corn Belt, Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was 5} cents to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.58 a bushel; corn was 4{
cents lower to 4 cents higher with September at $2.83 a bushel;
oats were 4 cents to 5 cents higher with September at $2.49 a
bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 14 cents higher with August at
$7.58 a bushel.
   Most livestock and meat futures were sharply higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .48 cent to 1.10 cents higher with August at
66.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to 1.03 cents
higher with August at 78.60 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower
to .78 cent higher with August at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent to 1.38 cents higher with August at 35.15
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Xerox Earnings Up 8 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. said Wednesday its profit
rose 8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, lifted by
foreign sales of business products and strong earnings from
financial services.
   The maker of photocopiers and other business products reported
that its second-quarter profit increased to $167 million, or $1.59
a share, from $154 million, or $1.44 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue was up 9 percent, to $4.1 billion from
$3.7 billion.
   ``Business products and systems again reflected a solid
performance in international operations, and financial services
continued its strong earnings momentum,'' David T. Kearns, chairman
and chief executive officer, said in a press statement.
   Xerox's financial services operations include insurance, credit
financing and investment banking.
   ``Our emphasis on customer satisfaction and tight cost controls
should combine with the strength of our new products to produce a
good year,'' Kearns said.
   In the first half of the year, Xerox's net income gained 11
percent _ to $319 million, or $2.96 a share, from $289 million, or
$2.69 a share, in the same period in 1987.
   First-half revenues rose 10 percent, to $7.9 billion from $7.2
billion.

   Midland Bank PLC said Wednesday it earned 179
million pounds in the first half, rebounding from the same period a
year earlier when it lost money because of additions to its
loan-loss reserves.
   The bank's first-half profit, which is the equivalent of $306
million, compares with a loss of 521 million pounds in the first
six months of 1987.
   Midland's 1987 first-half loss was the result of adding 916
million pounds to its reserves to protect against losses from loans
to underdeveloped countries. Other major banks around the world
took similar steps.
   In the first half of 1988, Midland added 90 million pounds to
its loan loss reservers.
   Midland's revenue in the first six months grew 14 percent to
1.35 billion pounds from 1.18 billion pounds.
   Interest income rose to 823 million pounds from 686 million
pounds a year earlier, wile other income, which includes
commissions and foreign exchange earnings, rose to 530 million
pounds from 489 million pounds.
   Profit from investment banking soared to 63 million pounds from
2 million pounds a year ago, when the bank was hit by the cost of
withdrawing from equity markets.
   The bank did not release quarterly results. It is not required
to under British law.

<HEAD>Baker Hughes Reports Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baker Hughes Inc. on Wednesday said it earned
$13.5 million in the 1988 third quarter, a sharp turnaround from
the $41.2 million loss it posted for the same period last year.
   The company's earnings amounted to 10 cents per share. Revenue
rose 20 percent to $564.1 million, from $468.4 million for the same
period last year.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co. merged with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., last year creating Baker Hughes Inc.,
which provides products and services to the oil, gas and mining
industries.
   ``Although oil and gas price concerns have tended to curtail
drilling activity in the United States this summer, the mix of
drilling rigs working has been favorable,'' said J. D. Woods, Baker
Hughes' president and chief executive officer.
   ``Offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have
excellent market presence, has been especially strong, generating a
higher percentage of the total U.S. activity than historical
norms,'' Woods said. ``Additionally, our non-U.S. oil and gas
related businesses have remained strong, as has our share of those
markets.''
   For the nine months, earnings were $55.1 million, or 42 cents a
share, compared with a $212.9 million loss for the same period last
year. The earnings this nine months included a net gain in the
first fiscal quarter of $30.1 million relating to a patent lawsuit
settlement reduced by certain charges related to ongoing
consolidation efforts.
   Last year's loss included merger and divestiture costs of $140
million.
   Revenue for the nine months totaled $1.6 billion, up from $1.4
billion last year.

<HEAD>Morale `Not on the Floor': Keating</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New material, editing thruout</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Associate Attorney General Frank
Keating said today that morale at the Justice Department is not as
bad as former top department officials have portrayed it.
   At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Keating said, ``The morale is not on the floor.''
   On Tuesday, former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
testified that when he resigned March 29 a ``deep malaise'' had set
in at the department in the face of Attorney General Edwin Meese
III's ongoing legal problems.
   Keating, however, testified that he doesn't think the morale
problem is as serious as Burns and former criminal division chief
William Weld portrayed it _ ``at least not today.''
   Keating said that when he came to the Justice Department in May
after serving as an assistant treasury secretary, ``I was under the
impression'' that it was ``a black hole over there'' in terms of
morale.
   ``I found that was not the case,'' Keating said.
   ``I think the department is functioning well and I look forward
to serving under'' the man chosen by President Reagan to be Meese's
successor, former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh, Keating
testified.
   Keating was asked by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., what could be
done to improve morale at the Justice Department.
   Keating replied that it is important for the Senate to confirm
nominees to top positions in the Justice Department. Keating is
serving in an acting capacity in the No. 3 job in the department
while Harold Christensen is serving as acting deputy attorney
general.
   Edward Dennis is the acting attorney general in charge of the
criminal division. The judiciary committee is holding a
confirmation hearing on Dennis today; a hearing for Christensen is
scheduled for Thursday.
   Earlier in the day, Burns said he believes Meese has a ``blind
spot'' on ethical issues and allowed himself to be ``hornswaggled''
by a friend trying to benefit from Meese's influence.
   Burns also described Vice President George Bush as showing deep
concern in a meeting to discuss the resignation of Burns and former
criminal division chief William E. Weld last March.
   Burns told the judiciary committee that Meese had created an
``Alice in Wonderland world where right was wrong and wrong became
right.''
   ``I am clinging to the notion that Ed Meese had a blind spot
where these ethical issues were concerned and that he was taken
advantage of, that he was abused, that he was hornswaggled by one
E. Bob Wallach,'' Burns said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Weld told the committee that if Meese were an ordinary citizen,
he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from
Wallach, a longtime friend of the attorney general.
   Meese has announced he will resign at the end of the month now
that an independent counsel has decided not to bring charges
against him following a lengthy investigation. Meese has criticized
the special counsel, James McKay, for saying in his report that the
attorney general ``probably committed'' three felonies and a
misdemeanor.
   Burns, in the CBS interview, described a meeting in which he and
Weld explained to President Reagan and Bush why they were resigning.
   ``The vice president was distressed. I've described him as being
florid,'' Burns said. ``He asked quesitons, and there was no doubt
when I left the meeting I felt that in time the problem would be
solved, as it has been by Mr. Meese's resignation.''
   Burns said Bush participated actively in the meeting. ``He was
both vocal and there was a lot of body language,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Meese's supporters were trying to undercut
congressional testimony by the former top aides.
   Complimentary letters about the attorney general from 10 current
and former Justice Department officials were released at the same
time Tuesday that the Senate committee was hearing testimony highly
critical of Meese.
   Burns told the committee the attorney general was responsible
for a ``deep malaise'' in the Justice Department.
   Meese responded by citing the favorable letters, saying ``it
appears that the rest of the leaders of the department don't agree
with Mr. Burns and they're the ones that are much closer to the
career employees.''
   Weld testified to the commitee that he resigned in protest last
March 29, along with Burns, after telling Meese that the attorney
general had probably broken the law.
   Weld told the judiciary committee that if Meese were an ordinary
citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking
gratuities from longtime friend Wallach, at whose request Meese had
provided assistance to Wedtech Corp. and on a $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline project.
   Weld said that on the morning he and Burns resigned, the
criminal division chief told Meese:
   ``Ed, I don't gainsay that there are other reasons why you might
have wanted to push these two projects (a $32 million engine
contract for Wedtech and the Iraqi oil pipeline) _ redeem the
campaign pledge in the South Bronx, save our cities, peace in the
Middle East. That is not the question.
   ``The question is whether Mr. Meese is taking official actions
that he knows are going to rebound to the financial benefit of his
friend.''
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten responded that
aggressive prosecutors can take the facts ``a little bit too far''
and pointed to the conclusion by McKay that Meese had not violated
the gratuities statute.
   McKay said in his 814-page report that ``there is no direct
evidence that Mr. Meese accepted anything of value from Mr. Wallach
with the requisite state of mind for a gratuities violation.''
   However, McKay said Meese should have been sensitive to the
possibility that Wallach's motivation was to show appreciation for
official activities benefiting him.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel's Profit Triples in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said its profit
tripled in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by
higher steel prices, increased shipments, improved productivity and
lower financing costs.
   The steelmaker reported on Wednesday second-quarter profit of
$151 million, or $2.05 a share, up from $47 million, or 79 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 27.3 percent, to $1.4 billion from
$1.1 billion.
   ``We expect favorable steel market conditions to continue
through the balance of the year,'' said Chairman Walter F.
Williams. ``Although steel shipments may decline modestly in the
third quarter due to normal seasonal factors, they should continue
at relatively high levels and prices are expected to remain firm.''
   The company's basic steel operations posted second-quarter
profit of $166 million and earnings for the first half of the year
of $264 million, up from $47 million and $96 million for the same
periods in 1987.
   Earnings at Bethlehem's plant at Sparrows Point, Md., also
improved over last year, the company said. The steel bar, rod and
wire division in Johnstown, Pa., posted second-quarter losses, but
improved from last year's losses because of increased shipments.
   The company's plant at Steelton, Pa., continued to incur losses
in the second quarter and the first six months of the year because
of depressed markets for rail and large diameter pipe, Bethlehem
said.
   In the first half of the year, the steelmaker's profit tripled
to $236 million, or $3.32 a share, from $72 million, or $1.17 a
share, a year earlier. First-half revenue rose to $2.73 billion
from $2.26 billion.

<HEAD>Henley to Sell Santa Fe Shares, Other Holdings to Itel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Henley Group Inc., which earlier
this year abandoned attempts to take over Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp., agreed to sell its Santa Fe shares to another rail company,
Itel Corp.
   The complex deal also calls for sale to the Chicago-based Itel
of Henley's holdings in American President Cos. Ltd. and three
other companies and would give Henley a 40 percent stake in Itel.
   The companies valued the total deal at $1.2 billion in cash and
stock.
   Henley, a holding company run by investor Michael Dingman out of
this San Diego-area coastal enclave, said it would receive $827
million cash and 18.7 million shares of Itel stock, giving it a 40
percent share of the transportation, dredging and wiring company.
   Itel would get Henley's 16.9 percent share of Chicago-based
Santa Fe; its 9.6 percent holding in American President, an
Oakland, Calif.,-based container freight company; and its 13.2
percent stake in Oak Industries. Itel also would get Henley's
wholly owned Signal Capital Corp. and Equilease Corp. subsidiaries.
   Henley, which has bought and reshuffled a number of companies in
recent years, would be subject to a 10-year standstill agreement
limiting the way its Itel shares could be voted or sold and
restricting further purchases, Itel said.
   An affiliate of Itel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Samuel
Zell and director Robert Lurie has agreed to buy warrants for
purchase of Itel stock to keep the men's 20 percent equity share,
the company said.
   The railroad portion of the deal is subject to federal antitrust
review, which Henley said is expected to take 30 days.
   The transaction would allow Itel to combine 30,000 railroad cars
owned by Signal's Pullman Leasing with Itel Rail's 43,000 cars to
make the largest railcar leasing operation in the country, Itel
said.
   On March 18, Henley abandoned plans to wage a proxy fight to
gain seats on Santa Fe's board after an adverse court decision and
said it would consider selling its stock in the railroad company.
   The action ended a six-month battle in which Henley had at
various times sought unsuccessfully to acquire all or part of Santa
Fe and had challenged the rail company's plans to restructure and
sell off assets.
   In announcing the deal, Henley also said it was proceeding with
plans to split its businesses into two companies. After the Itel
deal closes, Henley said, it will file documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the split into The
Wheelabrator Group Inc. and The Henley Group Inc.
   Wheelabrator would own Henley's share of Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. and other assets related to the waste-to-energy
business. The Henley Group Inc. would hold the rest of the
company's assets.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 16.3 percent due a lower tax rate and
continuing growth of its beer business.
   For the second quarter, net income was $211.5 million, or 72
cents a share, compared with of $181.8 million, or 60 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 6.3 percent to $2.53 billion from
$2.38 billion for the same period a year ago.
   August A. Busch III, the company's president, said Budweiser
sales continue to grow and its Busch brand ``experienced
broad-based geographic growth.''
   Busch said Bud Light, Michelob Light and Natural Light continued
to experience double-digit growth in the light-beer segment, the
fastest growing segment in the industry.
   The company said growth in net income and earnings per share
benefitted from the phase-in of lower federal income tax rates.
   For the first half of the year, net income was $363.9 million,
or $1.23 a share, up 17.4 percent from net income of $309.9
million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 6.7 percent to $4.79 billion from $4.49
billion for the first half of last year.
   Anheuser-Busch Inc., the company's beer operation, sold a record
20.6 million barrels of beer during the second quarter, an increase
of 2.3 percent from a year ago, and a record 39.9 million barrels
during the first six months of the year, an increase of 3.5 percent.
   The company's beer sales during the first half of the year
accounted for 40.7 percent of total brewing industry sales,
including imports, according to estimates from the Beer Institute.
For the first half of last year, the company's sales accounted for
39.4 percent of the market.
   The company said results from Campbell Taggart, a commercial
baker, substantially improved while Busch Entertainment's profit
contribution also increased substantially.

   Prices edged higher Wednesday on the London Stock
Exchange after long-awaited British and U.S. economic reports
failed to send any clear-cut signals to the stock market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 3.1
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,840.8.
   Volume was 363.9 million shares, up from 338 million shares
traded Tuesday.
   The British trade report, which showed a June deficit at the
high end of market expectations, knocked the index to its session
low of 9.2 points below Tuesday's close.
   But in the absence of concerted selling pressure, the index then
recovered to about the same level as before the report was
released, dealers said.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed 7 percent to 1.52
billion pounds, or about $2.6 billion, in June, the government said.
   Britain's current account deficit, which includes trade such as
services, narrowed 11 percent to 1.02 billion pounds, or about $1.7
billion.
   The pound responded to the trade numbers by falling suddenly,
but then recovered most of its losses.
   The equity market ``was only looking for disasters to change its
course,'' said Bob Semple, equity strategist at the London
investment firm County NatWest WoodMac. ``We're not going to see a
real upward thrust in equities until currencies start to
stabilize.''
   The market failed to react to a report that the U.S. economy
grew at a 3.1 percent rate in thew second quarter, analysts said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 5.8 points at 1,478.8
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.5 points
to close at 1,048.48.

<HEAD>Norfolk Southern's Profit Up 29.2 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norfolk Southern Corp. reported that its
after-tax profit rose 29.2 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, boosted by increased traffic and lower employee costs.
   The rail line, one of the nation's largest, said Wednesday that
its second-quarter profit rose to $158.2 million, or 87 cents a
share, from $122.4 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company said the earnings were the highest since its
reorganization in 1982.
   Second-quarter revenue increased 6 percent, to $1.11 billion
from $1.04 billion.
   ``This very favorable performance is due to the combination of
increased traffic and revenues, and reduced employee costs,'' said
Arnold B. McKinnon, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Norfolk Southern operates Norfolk and Western Railway Co.,
Southern Railway Co. and North American Van Lines Inc.
   McKinnon said rail traffic was up 5.9 percent in the second
quarter, while rail expenses showed no increase. He attributed that
to continued benefits from last year's voluntary early retirement
program.
   Debra Noxon, a company representative, said 2,100 nonunion
management employees had taken early retirement. Thirty-five
hundred union members _ conductors, firemen, engineers and clerks _
have opted for the retirement or separation programs since they
were first offered in 1985.
   In the first half of the year, Norfolk Southern's earnings rose
11.9 percent, to $276.7 million, or $1.51 a share, from $247.2
million, or $1.30 a share, a year earlier. The 1987 period included
an after-tax gain of $32.8 million, or 17 cents a share, from the
sale of 2.3 million shares of Piedmont Aviation stock.
   First-half revenue was up 5.8 percent, to $2.14 billion from
$2.02 billion.

<HEAD>Ford Reports Another Quarterly Earnings Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. reported Wednesday that
its second-quarter earnings climbed 11 percent from a year ago to
$1.66 billion, setting an auto industry record for the second
consecutive quarter.
   The profit was 2.5 percent above the previous industry record
the No. 2 automaker set in the first three months of this year.
   Ford said its earnings, which work out to $3.43 per share, came
on second-quarter sales of $22.39 billion. During the same period
last year, Ford earned $1.50 billion, or $2.90 per share, on sales
of $19.50 billion.
   In April, the company reported earnings of $1.62 billion, or
$3.31 per share, on sales of $20.74 billion for the first three
months of 1988. That broke the previous auto industry quarterly
earnings record of $1.61 billion posted by the much-larger General
Motors Corp. for the first quarter of 1984.
   ``We're just delighted with these earnings, ...'' David
McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, said Wednesday. ``But
we can't let up because the competition is tough.''
   Last week, GM reported a 29-percent increase in its
second-quarter earnings, compared with the same period last year.
Chrysler Corp., the nation's No. 3 automaker, is to report its
second-quarter figures Thursday.
   Ford said its latest earnings were based on strong business in
its international operations. The company said it made a record
$760 million outside the United States during the quarter, up 23.1
percent from overseas earnings of $536 million during the
April-June period last year.
   The bulk of the overseas gains came in Europe, where strong
sales volumes and currency rate changes pushed profits up, the
company said.
   ``The present leadership of Ford Motor Company was
internationally trained,'' Detroit auto analyst Arvid Jouppi said
Wednesday. ``The first Henry Ford was a world-class guy. Ford
(Motor Co.) became international long before anybody else even
thought about it.''
   The increases overseas offset an 8.8 percent decrease in its
U.S. earnings, which dropped to $903 million in the second three
months of this year from $982 million during the same period in
1987, Ford said.
   The company said sales incentives, higher material and labor
costs and development of new products depressed domestic earnings.
But Ford said those costs were offset partially by reduced
manufacturing costs and a lower tax rate.
   For the first half of 1988, Ford has earned $3.29 billion, or
$6.74 per share, on sales of $43.13 billion, up 10 percent over the
$2.99 billion, or $5.77 per share, on $37.64 billion in sales it
made during the first six months of 1987.
   Wednesday marked the ninth straight quarter in which Ford has
reported a record company profit and the fourth quarter in a row in
which it has outearned GM.
   ``Of course, to beat GM the way they have is like winning two
gold medals in the Olympics,'' Jouppi said. ``I've felt them to be
the best-managed worldwide corporation. Today, they're proving it.''
   Despite the showing, Jouppi said he doesn't expect Ford to
continue on the same pace. ``This is the last time that Ford, in
the near future, will beat General Motors in its earnings,'' he
predicted.
   ``They are very close right now, even in the second quarter and
Ford has the momentum to stay where it is, ...'' Jouppi added,
``but it's easier to move upward than to move down, and General
Motors has surely been down.''
   Another analyst, David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert in New
York City, disagreed.
   ``My guess is that GM is not gaining on them,'' he said. ``If
you look at GM's profits, they are just what they should have been.
... There's a big gap of profitability there that is not being
closed.
   ``I think Ford will have three times the profit margin of GM
this year,'' Healy said. ``GM does not appear to be catching up.''

   Crop futures closed mixed Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as late jitters about next week's weather
offset a rally that analysts said was long overdue.
   Corn closed mostly lower, soybeans were mostly higher and the
other grains were higher.
   Grain and soybeans traded higher for most of the session in a
technical rebound following seven straight days of generally
falling prices, analysts said.
   But late in the session a rumor surfaced that the National
Weather Service's new 6-to-10-day forecast would predict normal
rainfall in the drought-stricken Midwest for the middle of next
week, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The forecast was not expected to be released until after the
markets closed, but a similar rumor on Monday had been borne out by
the 6-to-10-day forecast released that day.
   ``Today people started selling when they heard that rumor and
down we went,'' Lespinasse said. ``We'll see what the 6-to-10-day
looks like and that will determine how we'll trade tomorrow.''
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 10\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.62 a bushel; corn was 7{
cents lower to 2 cents higher with September at $2.80 a bushel;
oats were 4{ cents to 8 cents higher with September at $2.49 a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 17{ cents higher with
August at $7.52 a bushel.

   Ralston Purina Co. announced Wednesday that it
had agreed to sell its Van Camp Seafood division to a group of
investors led by PT Mantrust, a privately held Indonesian concern.
   Terms of the definitive agreement were not disclosed.
   The group of investors also includes Prudential-Bache

   PT Mantrust, based in Jakarta, Indonesia, is an international

tuna processing, dairy farming and livestock, mushroom farming,
canned and bottled foods and beverages, can manufacturing and
trading and brokerage activities.
   Van Camp Seafood markets canned tuna and salmon products under

tuna processor with sales of $290 million last year.
   Van Camp operates tuna processing canneries in Puerto Rico and
American Samoa and can manufacturing subsidiaries in San Diego and
Puerto Rico.
   A spokesman for Ralston Purina said the company had begun
looking into a possible sale in late 1987.

<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. on Wednesday said its
second-quarter net income slipped 1 percent to $263 million partly
because of lower earnings from its oil and gas exploration and
production division.
   Net income totaled $266 million in the 1987 period. Shell, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell of the Netherlands,
does not release per share figures.
   Revenue totaled $5.4 billion for the quarter, up from $5.2
billion a year ago.
   In the oil and gas exploration and production division, earnings
totaled $73 million in the second quarter, down from $152 million
for the same period last year.
   But earnings from oil products nearly doubled, totaling $103
million in the second quarter, compared with $56 million in the
year-ago period. Earnings from chemical products were $133 million,
up from $101 million in the same period last year.
   Shell President Frank H. Richardson said strong earnings in the
oil and chemical products divisions helped to offset the decline in
exploration and production earnings, which mainly reflected lower
crude oil prices.
   ``The outlook in our exploration and production segment is, for
the most part, tied directly to crude oil and natural gas prices.
Crude oil prices have been at lower levels than a year ago,''
Richardson said.
   For the first six months, net income totaled $609 million, a 63
percent increase from the $374 million earned in the first half of
1987. Total consolidated net income for the first half was $1.5
billion, which includes a one-time gain of $900 million as a result
of a new accounting measures adopted in the first quarter.
   Six-month revenue totaled $10.5 billion this year and $9.7
billion last year.

<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. announced Wednesday it would
sell all of its supermarkets in Florida, saying it could not afford
to invest the money needed to compete in that rapidly growing
market.
   The units to be sold include 43 supermarkets in the Florida
Choice food and drugstore chain, 39 liquor stores and three
supermarkets under construction.
   ``Our Florida Choice operations have been unprofitable for some
time, and our own projections indicate that too much time and
additional investment would be required to make them profitable,''
Kroger President Joseph Pichler said in a statement.
   The decision does not affect the three Kroger-owned warehouse
stores, known as Welcome Stores, in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Kroger spokesman Jim McIntire said Florida Choice's 5,000
employees were notified of the decision Wednesday. The stores will
continue to operate until they have been sold, he said.
   McIntire would not say how much money the Florida Choice chain
has lost or for how long it has been unprofitable. He also would
not say how much money Kroger felt it had to invest to be
competitive.
   He said optimistic estimates indicated that many of the stores
could be sold in 60 days. The stores could be sold individually or
as a chain, with profits being reinvested in other Kroger stores or
being used to repurchase Kroger common stock periodically, McIntire
said.
   Kroger entered the Florida market in 1980 when it opened a
SupeRx drugstore there. The SupeRx chain was sold in 1986 and the
remaining supermarkets were renamed Florida Choice.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frosts that hit Brazil's southern
coffee belt this week may reduce next year's expected bumper
harvest, government agronomists said Wednesday.
   The extent of the damage was not immediately known but was not
thought to be heavy, the agronomists said.
   ``If Brazil was expecting a harvest of 40 million bags next
year, the frost might reduce it to 39 million,'' Erlei Guimaraes,
an agonomist with the government's Brazilian Coffee Institute, said
by telephone from Varginha in Minas Gerais state, the country's No.
1 Coffee-growing state.
   Brazil is the world's largest coffee grower and exporter, and
the United States is its main market.
   Guimaraes said frosts Tuesday and Wednesday ``affected the tips
and leaves of coffee trees, which will produce less next year. But
the inner part of the branches was not hurt.''
   Minas Gerais is expected to produce about 8.3 million 132-pound
bags of coffee this year, about one-third of Brazil's total crop.
   The cold weather does not affect this year's harvest, which is
already being picked. But it can hurt next season's production that
starts when the coffee trees flower in September.
   In Sao Paulo state, the No. 2 Coffee producer, light frosts
occurred in the northwestern coffee plantations but did not cause
significant damage, said Alceu Veiga Filho, an economist with the
Sao Paulo state Agriculture Department.
   Frosts were more severe in Parana, the third-largest coffee
producer, south of Sao Paulo.
   ``The frosts hit harder here. Next year's harvest will be down,
but we'll only know how much in two or three days,'' Pedro Simoes,
an agronomist with the Parana state Agriculture Department, said by
telephone from Curitiba, the state capital, 523 miles southwest of
Rio.
   Simoes said Parana would harvest 2.5 million bags of coffee this
year and had expected a 5 million bag harvest in 1989.
   Temperatures rose slightly in southern Brazil on Wednesday but
frost warnings were still posted for the coffee belt.
   After severe frosts in the mid-1970s, many of Brazil's coffee
trees were replanted farther north, where the weather in winter is
warmer.

   Big Board volume totaled 135.89 million shares, against 121.96
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index fell
1.29 to 148.74.

<HEAD>Du Pont Reports 27 Percent Gain In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co. said Wednesday its
second-quarter profit jumped 27 percent because gains in a number
of key businesses.
   Net income totaled $639 million, or $2.67 a share, in the three
months ended June 30, compared with $504 million, or $2.08 a share,
in the second quarter of 1987.
   Sales during the period rose 9 percent to $8.5 billion, from
$7.8 billion last year.
   Second-quarter earnings included a $43 million gain from the
sale of the company's interest in a North Sea oil property.
   Chairman Richard E. Heckert attributed the second-quarter
showing to strong sales and earnings from a number of the company's
operations including agricultural and industrial chemicals as well
as downstream petroleum and coal.
   ``The company's effort to expand markets worldwide, coupled with
continued emphasis on productivity, were important factors in our
earnings growth,'' he said.
   Net income for the first six months rose 37 percent to $1.2
billion, or $5.12 a share, compared with $895 million, or $3.70 a
share in the year-ago period.
   Sales for the first six months were $16.5 billion, up 10 percent
from the $14.9 billion during the same period last year.

<HEAD>Pan Am Posts $5 Million Loss; USAir's Profit Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially ailing Pan Am Corp. on Wednesday reported a net loss
of $5 million in the second quarter, while USAir Group Inc. said
its after-tax profit rose 21 percent during the same period.
   New York-based Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said
the loss compared with an after-tax profit of $10.5 million, or 8
cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   The loss occurred despite a 19.8 percent rise in second-quarter
revenue, to $1.07 billion from $896.8 million a year earlier.
   The company blamed the earnings deterioration largely on a loss
of $19.9 million at Pan American World Airways, compared with
profit of $6.3 million a year earlier. The loss at World Airways,
Pan Am's main subsidiary, was partly offset by improvement in its
Northeast shuttle operation, the company said.
   World Airways' earnings were hurt by increased fuel costs,
higher aircraft rental charges and higher costs of new maintenance
standards, Pan Am said.
   Pan Am recently reached a tentative labor agreement with leaders
of its biggest union, the Transport Workers, and withdrew its
earlier threat to sell a large portion of its assets. The accord,
if ratified by the Transport Workers' membership, is expected to
save the airline around $81 million over the next three years.
   The Transport Workers union is the third out of the five unions
at Pan Am to sign a new cost-saving contract with the carrier,
which is still seeking $90 million in wage cuts from its flight
attendants and has imposed $35 million in reductions on the
Teamsters under federal labor rules.
   The new agreement with the Transport Workers ``brings us
significantly nearer to finalizing our total labor cost reduction
package,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said in announcing
the second-quarter results.
   The company has lost about $1.7 billion since 1981.
   In the first half of the year, Pan Am's loss widened to $88.4
million from a loss of $83.1 million a year earlier. First-half
revenue was up 19.2 percent, to $1.97 billion from $1.66 billion.
   Washington-based USAir Group, the ninth-largest U.S. carrier,
reported that its second-quarter profit rose to $92.5 million, or
$2.14 a share, from $72.7 million, or $2.32 a share, on 25.8
percent fewer shares a year earlier.
   Revenue in the latest quarter more than doubled, to $1.5 billion
from $619.6 million.
   ``Second-quarter results are indicators of trends that began in
March and have continued to date,'' said Chairman and President
Edwin I. Colodny. ``I am also pleased that all subsidiaries of
USAir Group contributed to the record profitability of the second
quarter.''
   USAir Group operations include USAir Inc., Piedmont Aviation,
four wholly-owned commuter airline subsidiaries, and a leasing and
servicing unit. Pacific Southwest Airlines, which was acquired by
USAir in May 1987, was merged into USAir on April 9 of this year.
Piedmont is to be merged into USAir in early 1989.
   In the first six months of the year, USAir's net income declined
23.4 percent _ to $73.7 million, or $1.70 a share, from $96.2
million, or $3.13 a share. First-half revenue more than doubled, to
$2.7 billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier.

   Stock prices declined broadly in quiet trading
Wednesday as traders found little encouragement in the latest
statistics on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.27 to
2,053.70, its lowest close since it stood at 2,052.45 on June 2.
   From the 1988 closing high of 2,158.61 it reached on July 5, the
average has fallen 104.91 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
480 up, 936 down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.89 million
shares, against 121.96 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 164.07 million shares.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department said the
nation's gross national product grew at an estimated annual rate of
3.1 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter.
   It also revised its earlier estimate of first-quarter GNP growth
from 3.6 percent to 3.4 percent.
   The latest data were a bit below many advance estimates on Wall
Street, and thus tended to reduce fears that the economy was
growing too fast.
   But brokers said traders were not heartened by accompanying
figures showing inflation at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, up from 1.7 percent in the first three months of
the year.
   Eastman Kodak rose | to 43\ as the company reported earnings for
the second quarter of $1.20 a share, up from $1.06 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Bethlehem Steel added { to 24} on higher second-quarter
operating earnings.
   But other blue chips didn't fare so well in the prevailing
atmosphere of caution and apathy. International Business Machines
dropped 1{ to 121[; Procter & Gamble 1| to 71}; International Paper
1| to 52|; Hewlett-Packard 1] to 48], and Philip Morris 1 to 89.
   Liz Claiborne fell 2 to 14 as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. Late Tuesday the company reported lower
second-quarter earnings.
   Shaklee, traded on the Big Board, dropped 1\ to 19| on word that
per-share profits for the second quarter shrank to 20 cents from 42
cents in the like period last year.
   Zayre, caught up in takeover speculation, climbed 1] to 21~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $22.36 billion, or 0.84
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.29 to 148.74.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index dropped 3.30 to 303.15, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.69 at 262.50.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gave
up 2.47 to 383.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.85, down 1.79.

<HEAD>Rain Fears Hold Crop Futures In Check; Mixed Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jitters about next week's weather held crop futures prices in
check Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade where corn prices
fell, soybeans were mixed and wheat was higher.
   On other markets, coffee futures plummeted; sugar fell sharply;
precious metals were higher; livestock and meat were mixed; energy
futures advanced; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Chicago grain and soybean futures traded higher for most of the
session in a technical rebound following seven straight days of
generally falling prices linked to improved crop conditions in the
drought-stricken Midwest.
   But late in the session a rumor surfaced that the National
Weather Service's new 6-to-10-day forecast would predict normal
rainfall in the region during the middle of next week, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The rumor was correct. The forecast, released about 1{ hours
after the close, called for above-normal temperatures and normal
rainfall in most of the Midwest during the five days beginning
Tuesday.
   A similar rumor on Monday had been borne out by the 6-to-10-day
forecast released that day.
   ``Today people started selling when they heard that rumor and
down we went,'' Lespinasse said.
   The price rise earlier in the day reflected bargain-basement
buying after the sharp break in prices _ particularly for soybeans
_ during the past seven days, analysts said. Soybeans for August
delivery had tumbled nearly $2.40 during that period to a 9-week
low of $7.55{ a bushel.
   ``This market has undergone significant damage and I think
people now will be more inclined to buy on the breaks,'' said Rich
Feltes, grains analyst with Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based
commodity trading firm.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 10\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.61{ a bushel; corn was 8{ cents lower
to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.79} a bushel; oats were 4{
cents to 8 cents higher with September at $2.49 a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents lower to 17 cents higher with August at $7.53{ a
bushel.
   Coffee futures plummeted to their lowest levels since Dec. 14 on
New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, mimicking Tuesday's
sharp sell-off in sugar futures. Sugar futures extended their
losses.
   The coffee market plunged despite the International Coffee
Organization's announcement that it was cutting export quotas in a
move designed to bolster prices, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   The 1.5-million-bag quota reduction brought to 51.5 million bags
the total amount of coffee that producer countries may export
during the current marketing year, which ends on Sept. 30. It was
the second quota reduction this quarter and the ICO is allowed no
make no more quota cuts for the marketing year.
   The sell-off was triggered when the price for September delivery
of coffee slipped below $1.31 a pound, a psychologically important
level for technical traders, Badenhop said.
   ``We just saw a wholesale bailout of speculative and fund money
from the market today,'' he said.
   September coffee settled 8.90 cents lower at $1.2405 a pound.
October sugar settled .71 cents lower at 11.35 cents a pound.
   Strong cash prices and expectations for a bullish cattle
inventory report Friday from the Agriculture Department supported
cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The cattle inventory report is expected to show that
drought-related selling of cattle by producers has reduced the
nation's cattle herd to its lowest level in 25 years, said Charlie
Richardson, livestock market analyst for Lind-Waldock & Co. in
Denver.
   Pork futures finished mostly lower, with hog prices pressured by
a drop in the volatile pork-belly market, Richardson said.
   Live cattle settled .48 cent to .97 cent higher with August at
66.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.25 cents
higher with August at 78.82 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower
to .13 cent higher with August at 45.37 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.85 cents lower to .20 cent higher with August at
32.95 cents a pound.
   Precious metal futures on New York's Commodity Exchange were
buoyed by a government report that inflation had risen 4.7 percent
in the first quarter, the sharpest increase in almost six years,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.50 to $1.80 higher with August at $433.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 6.8 cents to 9.6 cents higher with July at $6.964
a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices headed higher in light trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting some new optimism about OPEC's
prospects for bolstering prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 26 cents
higher with September at $16.16 a barrel; heating oil was .45 cent
to 1.22 cents higher with August at 45.03 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent to .80 cent higher with August at 50.80 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 3.20 points lower at 262.95.

<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 8 percent on a 29 percent revenue
increase despite a sluggish performance in the company's core
business, photographic products.
   For the quarter ended June 12, the company earned $390 million,
or $1.20 a share, up from $362 million, or $1.06 a share, a year
ago. Sales totaled $4.13 billion, up from the $3.21 billion
recorded in last year's second quarter.
   Both the earnings and sales figures were records for the
quarter, the company said.
   ``I think these numbers are more of a surprise than most people
thought,'' said Mark Obenzinger, a stock analyst at Wood, Gundy &
Co. in New York. ``It looks like everything is cooking on all
burners.''
   Although sales and earnings were higher because of last
February's acquisition of Sterling Drug Co., the maker of such
products as Bayer aspirin and Lysol disinfectant sprays, Kodak
spokesman Paul Allen said records would have been set even without
Sterling's help.
   ``It's hard to single out any one thing that really stood out.
We had good advances across the board,'' Allen said.
   He was unable to provide exact figures on just how helpful
Sterling has been to Kodak's bottom line.
   A lower corporate income tax rate also helped Kodak to the
record, Allen said.
   Profits for the first six months of the year were up 20 percent
at a record $650 million, or $2 a share, compared with the first
half of 1987 when they were $540 million, or $1.59 a share. Sales
for the first half of the year, at $7.46 billion, were up 27
percent, compared with last year's $5.86 billion.
   The company, which is one of this country's 10 largest
exporters, continued to enjoy the benefits of the weak U.S. dollar
that has made American products cheaper overseas.
   The best example of this can be found in Kodak's imaging
segment, which includes the company's mainstay products of film and
photographic paper. Sales in this country declined 1 percent in the
second quarter, but jumped 13 percent elsewhere.
   Overall, sales for the second quarter increased 24 percent in
the United States and 33 percent in the rest of the world.
   The imaging segment offered the most interesting aspect of the
financial report, according to Eugene Glazer, analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds. Worldwide profits for both the quarter and the
first half of the year were down, Glazer noted.
   ``This is because of a very significant sales phenomenon as a
result of the introduction of Kodak's new `Gold' film,'' he said.
``Dealers are selling out of inventory with the old film and
haven't been able to order enough of the new film from Kodak.''
   As a result film sales are on the decline, Glazer said.
   Kodak Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colby Chandler
adressed that problem in his brief comment about the financial
results when he noted that early results from the third quarter
indicate strong sales of the new Kodacolor Gold film.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major currencies
Wednesday following a government report showing
slower-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy and intervention by
central banks.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid of $433.45 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $431.90 late Tuesday.
   Analysts said the dollar fell quickly after the U.S. Commerce
Department reported that the gross national product rose 3.1
percent in the second quarter. Analysts said the market had
expected a rise to between 3.4 percent and 4 percent.
   European traders had been scooping up dollars before the report,
anticipating a healthier growth in the U.S. economy, but they
hurried to dump their dollar holdings once the report was out,
dealers overseas said.
   ``Europeans have been fairly bullish and buying dollars for
days,'' said Chris Bourdain, a trader at Bank of America in New
York. But following the report, ``the dollar dropped off very
quickly on panic selling. They wanted to get out,'' he said.
   Analysts said the West German Bundesbank and the U.S. Federal
Reserve intervened in the market, selling dollars and buying marks
to keep the currency stable.
   Central bank intervention as well as statements by European
government officials and U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity
implied that the dollar was within a recent target range set by the
Group of Seven nations, analysts said.
   The G-7 includes the United States, Britain, Canada, West
Germany, France, Italy and Japan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 132.50
yen. Later, in London, it fell back to 131.68 yen. In New York, it
fell to 131.63 from 132.43 late Tuesday.
   The dollar's fall pushed up the British pound despite a
larger-than-expected rise in Britain's trade deficit in June.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7265 late in the
day, up from $1.7135 late Tuesday. In later New York trading, it
cost $1.7288 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7075 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8593; 1.5384
Swiss francs, down from 1.5463; 6.2255 French francs, down from
6.2615; 1,364.00 Italian lire, down from 1,373.25; and 1.2056
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2093.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8495 West German marks, down from 1.8600; 1.5375
Swiss francs, down from 1.5455; 6.2375 French francs, down from
6.2670; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0975; 1,365.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,374.50; and 1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2083.
   Gold and silver prices held within a narrow range. Dealers in
Zurich said the two metals appear to have found some technical
support after their plunge on Monday, when gold fell almost $16 and
ounce, and silver dropped 55.5 cents.
   Gold closed at $433.30 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, up from $431.10 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in London, gold slipped to a late bid price of $433 a
troy ounce, from $433.50 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price
was $432.50, up from $431.50 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $432.34,
unchanged from Tuesday.
   Silver finished at $6.964 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, up
from $6.880 late Tuesday. In London, silver fell to a late bid
price of $7.00 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $7.01.

<HEAD>Primerica Earnings Flat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Primerica Corp. on Wednesday reported
flat second-quarter earnings on a 45 percent increase in revenues.
   Net income for the quarter totaled $50.5 million, the same as
the second quarter in 1987. A slight drop in the number of
outstanding shares increased per-share earnings to 91 cents.
   The Greenwich-based company said a gain from retiring debt added
10 cents per share or $5.4 million to the earnings totals for the
period.
   Primerica revenues for the 1988 second quarter were $1.1 billion
up from $748.5 million a year ago. The revenues included those
generated by Smith Barney, which was acquired by Primerica in 1987.
   Net income for the first half of the year totaled $106.2
million, off from $120.2 million last year. Revenues in the first
half of 1988 were $2.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the
same period in 1987.
   Gerald Tsai Jr., Primerica chairman and chief executive officer,
said, ``Many of Primerica's businesses performed well during the
second quarter, and earnings continued to benefit from lower
corporate expenses.''
   He also said the operating income for the company's financial
services businesses, excluding investment banking and securities
brokerage, was ``limited to a 3 percent improvement year-to year,
primarily due to lower earnings from the company's mutual fund
subsidiary resulting from continued investor uncertainity.
   ``Smith Barney's commissions, trading and underwriting revenues
were adversely affected by prolonged sluggishness in the financial
markets, resulting in a small operating loss for the investment
banking and securities brokerage subsidiary during the period,''
Tsai said.

   Chrysler Motors Corp. said Wednesday it is
raising prices for one model and cutting the cost of two others to
remain competitive in the subcompact car market.
   The cost of the Plymouth Colt E will decrease 3 percent compared
with a comparably equipped 1988 model, from $7,503 to $7,279. The
Plymouth Colt GT will increase by 0.1 percent, from $8,612 for a

Chrysler spokesman Tony Cervone said.
   The Mitsubishi-built Dodge Colt will decrease from $6,676 for a
comparably equipped 1988 model to $6,477 for the 1989 model,
Cervone said.
   The three models have been redesigned for 1989, the company
said. The redesign includes different exterior styling, five more
feet of cargo space, an improved ventilation system and a split
folding rear seat, the automaker said.

   Investors who jumped into the agricultural
commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last
spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather
changed for the wetter, experts say.
   With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for
future delivery of grains and soybeans have fallen precipitously.
   ``This is not a good market for speculators anymore,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, grain market analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the
livestock and sugar futures markets, and has prompted some
economists to lower their month-old projections for 1989 food
inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less.
   That may be good news for consumers but it's a weak balm for the
bruised speculators who bet on rising crop prices but failed to
collect their winnings when the markets peaked late last month and
early this month.
   The ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that
ended Tuesday with soybeans for August delivery at $7.55{ a bushel,
a 31 percent drop from the contract's high of $10.93{, reached on
June 23. The value of a 5,000-bushel soybean contract plunged
nearly $17,000 during the period.
   August corn settled Tuesday at $2.87{ a bushel, down 21 percent
from its high of $3.64 on July 5.
   The reason for the collapse: rain. After 2{ months of
unseasonable heat and very little water in the Corn Belt, the
Midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the struggling crops
about two weeks ago. Five days of scattered showers were followed
by cool temperatures, then more rain, then more cool temperatures.
   The change in the weather ``turned this market on a dime,'' said
Rich Feltes, chief grain market analyst for Refco Inc., a large,
Chicago-based speculative trading firm.
   ``Trees don't grow to the sky, and this certainly is a reminder
of that old trading adage.'' Feltes said. ``Things don't go up
forever.''
   Soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the
agricultural commodities because the nation's relatively small
soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to
changing weather patterns during the growing season.
   Speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in April after
the Agriculture Department predicted U.S. soybean inventories would
total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins
on Sept. 1, down from 436 million bushels a year earlier.
   On April 4, August soybean futures settled at $6.80 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Speculators who bought in at that price
and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits.
They could sell today and still come out ahead.
   Analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into
the soybean market at about $9 a bushel in mid-June and were
determined not to sell until prices topped $11. Soybeans never went
that high and by the second week in July, those investors were
losing money on paper. Many have been forced to sell at a loss.
   ``People bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and,
lo and behold, those speculators are out now,'' said Steve Bruce,
an analyst with Gelderman Inc., a Chicago trading firm that caters
to commercial processors of grain.
   ``It's not easy to make money trading commodities and I think a
lot of people found that out,'' he said.
   Some commodity funds managed by large investment houses and
speculative commodity-trading firms had gains as high as 35 percent
in June, said Chicagoan Jay Klopfenstein, who tracks more than 90
such investment pools and publishes their results in his monthly
Norwood Index.
   But Klopfenstein's own fund, the Norwood Hyacinth Fund, was down
12 percent as of Wednesday morning, according to its management
firm, Dunn Commodities Inc. of Stuart, Fla.
   Sophisticated commodity traders can profit from a falling market
as well as a rising one. But analysts said the public loves a bull
market and it's difficult to persuade investors to bet that prices
will fall.
   Feltes said American farmers also were losers in the drought
rally. He said grain growers could have used futures and options
markets to lock in high prices for their crops for the next two or
three years, but relatively few did.
   ``The American farmer is at fault here,'' Feltes said. ``We had
these prices up here for a month and he just let them go by.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Express Doubts on FCC Proposal in Telephone Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House telecommunications
subcommittee said Wednesday they remain unconvinced that consumers
will benefit from a Federal Communications Commission proposal to
change the way telephone companies are regulated.
   Panel members said they were open-minded about the FCC's
proposal to lift limits on the profits of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. and the local Bell phone companies and instead set a
ceiling on prices. But they said they have yet to see evidence that
the change would benefit ratepayers.
   ``The only thing that we know for certain is that this plan has
raised more questions than it answers,'' said Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., subcommimttee chairman.
   AT&T and the Bell companies have been lobbying hard for a change
from profit regulation to price caps, but other players in the
telecommunications industry fear the proposal would give these
large companies too much power over competitors.
   The FCC could vote on the plan this fall and put it into effect
next year unless Congress acted to block the plan or pressured the
FCC to drop it.
   At the panel's hearing, Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T vice president
of marketing services, supported the plan as it applied to his
company, the nation's largest long-distance company and serving
about 70 percent of the market.
   The rates of AT&T, the only long-distance company whose
interstate business is federally regulated, set the pace for the
rest of the industry.
   Limits on prices rather than profits would ``in all probability
result in greater price decreases or smaller price increases'' by
creating incentives for cost-savings by allowing the company to be
more competitive and innovative, Garfinkel said.
   But as applied to the Bell companies, the proposal fails to
assure that charges for connection to the local phone networks will
drop with declining costs, he said.
   MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance company, also
opposes price caps for the Bell companies because of the local
companies' control of access to the local phone network.
   Local access charges are already excessive, and higher charges
would simply raise long-distance rates for consumers, said Gerald
J. Kovach, MCI senior vice president.
   Philip Campbell, chief financial officer of Bell Atlantic, said
the Bell companies and thus consumers would benefit from the same
encouragement for cost-savings, efficiencies and innovation that
AT&T would under price caps.
   At a minimum, local phone rates would go up 3 percent less than
inflation, he said.
   But Dennis Dundon, chairman of the Competitive
Telecommunications Association, which represents more than 100
long-distance companies, said lifting profit regulation on AT&T and
the Bell companies would be a mistake.
   ``Deregulating monopolies is just not good policy,'' Dundon said.
   Without adequate controls, AT&T would be able to undercut
competition by charging below cost for some services and making up
the difference with higher prices on essential services. The Bell
companies, given more flexibility, could tailor service
arrangements for the large long-distance companies at the expense
of the smaller companies.
   ``The price cap plan is appropriate only in a fully competitive
environment, where market forces would exercise a check on
excessive or predatory prices,'' he said in his testimony.

<HEAD>New Leasing Company Plans ``Significant'' Order Of Boeing 757s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new aircraft leasing company formed by Great
Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC and GPA Group Ltd. of Ireland plans to
acquire a ``significant fleet'' of Boeing 757 passenger jets, in a
deal possibly worth billions of dollars to the Seattle planemaker,
a Rolls Royce spokesman said Wednesday.
   Michael Jolley, spokesman for Rolls-Royce's U.S. unit, said the
company envisions an order ``in the range of recent deals completed
by Boeing with American Airlines and United Airlines.''
   In May, American announced it was buying 50 757-200s and taking
options on 50 more in a deal worth more than $4 billion if all 100
planes are delivered. A few days later, United said it was ordering
30 757s and taking options on 30 more, an order United Chairman
Stephen M. Wolf valued at more than $2 billion.
   ``We're talking about that sort of order,'' Jolley said in a
telephone interview from the Greenwich, Conn., headquarters of
Rolls-Royce's U.S. subsidiary. ``We can't be more specific at the
moment.''
   He said the two partners in the new venture company, GPA Rolls
Ltd., were negotiating with Boeing Commercial Airplanes officials,
but he declined to say when an order might be placed.
   Boeing spokesman John Wheeler said he had no information about
any negotiations. ``They simply advised us of their preference for
the 757 and some of the delivery dates they were looking for,'' he
said.
   ``We don't have a contract or anything with them at this
point,'' he said. ``We're just glad to see it at this point as an
endorsement of this particular model.''
   Formation of the new company was announced Wednesday by Sir
Ralph Robins, managing director of Rolls-Royce, and T.A. Ryan,
chairman and chief executive of GPA Group, who signed a memorandum
of understanding in London.
   GPA currently leases 135 aircraft valued at more than $2
billion. The company does not have any 757s, Boeing said, but has
115 of the smaller Boeing 737s.
   The twin-engine 757-200 can carry up to 228 passengers for 3,000
nautical miles.
   The 757, first introduced in 1982, had been a lagging seller
until this year, when the American and United orders were placed.
So far this year, 121 of the planes have been ordered, compared
with 239 for all previous years, said Boeing spokesman Tom Cole.
   Boeing only lists firm aircraft orders in its records, not
options.
   For 1988, Boeing has orders for 426 commercial jets, worth a
total $19.01 billion. The company is well on its way to a
fourth-straight year of record orders. In 1987, 366 jets worth
$19.9 billion were ordered.
   Boeing has a backlog of more than 170 757s, and Wheeler said
space on the 757 assembly line in suburban Renton has been booked
well into 1991.
   Boeing says the 757 is unsurpassed for fuel efficiency and
exceeds the toughest airport noise standards. But with fuel prices
remaining low in recent years, airlines had been reluctant to place
orders for the new jets, which run $41 million to $47 million a
copy.
   Besides being quiet and cheap to run, industry analysts and
airline executives have said many carriers are choosing the 757
because the aging planes in airline fleets are starting to require
too much maintenance. Also, as airports are becoming more
congested, American and other carriers are looking at 757s to
replace smaller-capacity planes on many routes.
   GPA and Rolls-Royce like the plane because it can be used in a
wide variety of applications, including transatlantic flights,
Jolley said.
   ``The 757 is a pretty flexible airplane,'' he said, noting that
it is used by a wide range of operators from major trunk airlines
to tour operators.
   Rolls-Royce also has been a supplier of engines for the plane
since its inception. Part of the GPA-Rolls-Royce deal is that the
planes will be equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines,
Jolley said.
   Of the 360 757s ordered so far, 211 are or will have Rolls-Royce
engines. Pratt & Whitney is the other major engine supplier for the
plane.

   The arrests of 26 merchants on charges
of selling sexually explicit T-sirts have raised questions of
anti-Semitism and constitutional rights in this beach resort city.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' said Mayor Bob Grissom, who said the
sweep was designed to get offensive T-shirts off the streets.
   The allegations of anti-Semitism surfaced outside a police
station Tuesday when those arrested were released on bail. Several
defendants and their relatives, who would not identify themselves,
complained they were targets of the probe because they were Jewish.
   ``They feel very badly that they were mistreated,'' said Rabbi
Doran Aizenman of Chabad Lubavitch, who met and prayed with the
defendants at the jail. ``I think it's natural that's
(anti-Semitism) one of the things that came up.''
   Eighteen of the 26 people arrested were Jewish, Aizenman said
Wednesday, adding that 17 were from Israel.
   Rabbi Rubin Kesner of Temple Emanuel, a conservative Jewish
congregation, said the issue of anti-Semitism ``is merely a nasty
ploy by this group that has been challenged with illegality in
their business.''
   Kesner said those arrested are not part of his congregation but
added ``the Jewish teaching is the law of the land supersedes all
other laws.''
   Kesner said that during his 24 years in Myrtle Beach ``I have
never had an anti-Semitic experience.''
   Many of those arrested have declined to talk with reporters,
saying they are afraid their complaints might lead to more legal
problems.
   ``Police didn't tell us what not to sell. I just don't know
exactly what's going on,'' said Solomon Castro, a store owner who
was arrested. He said he would stop selling T-shirts when told
which ones not to sell.
   Those arrested are charged with violating state obscenity
statutes, a felony offense punishable by up to three years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Under state law, something is considered obscene if it appeals
to the prurient interest in sex, is patently offensive and, when
applied to contemporary standards, has no artistic, political or
scientific value.
   Police began buying T-shirts in beach shops over the weekend.
They were shown to Solicitor Jim Dunn who told authorities which
decals would be considered obscene under state law. Police have not
confiscated any T-shirts from the stores.
   One of the T-shirts carried a cartoon of a male sex organ
wearing a condom with the slogan ``Captain Condom'' on the front.
   Jack Flom, an attorney representing the merchants, said they
were hoping to get a national organization such as the
Anti-Defamation League involved in the matter.
   Bonds in the case were set at amounts ranging from $10,000 to
$30,000 by City Judge Dwight C. Lambe. All those arrested were
released by early Wednesday morning.
   The amount of the bonds was in the same range as those set in
three recent murder cases in the county.
   Circuit Judge Don Rushing has agreed to review the bail.
   The bond amounts brought fire from Steve Bates, the executive
director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   He called them an ``outrage,'' adding ``jaywalking is more
dangerous than these shirts.''

<HEAD>Digital Earnings Up 6.4 Percent In Its Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYNARD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said Wednesday its
fourth-quarter earnings rose by 6.4 percent from the same period a
year earlier, reflecting continued worldwide sales growth.
   The giant computer company posted a profit of $401 million, or
$3.08 per share, in the three months ended July 2. That compared
with a profit of $377 million, or $2.85 per share, in the same
quarter last year, the company said.
   Operating revenue during the quarter rose to $3.34 billion from
$2.67 billion a year earlier.
   ``We are pleased with the strong gains as our growth continued
to outpace that of the industry,'' Digital President Kenneth H.
Olsen said in a statement.
   ``This performance reflects the growing number of large
organizations around the world that are implementing Digital's
enteprise-wide computing solutions,'' Olsen said.
   For its fiscal year, Digital reported net income of $1.3
billion, or $9.90 per share, up 15 percent from $1.14 billion, or
$8.53 per share for last year. Revenue rose 22 percent to $11.48
billion from $9.39 billion last year, the company said.
   Company officials credited the increased earnings to growth in
Digital's VAX product line.
   ``Demand was seen across the whole VAX family,'' Olsen said.
``At the low end, we shipped more than 12,000 work stations during
the fourth quarter and 30,000 for the year, thus reaching a
leadership position in this rapidly growing market.''
   ``The Micro-VAX 3000 series did particularly well and over 500
VAX 6200 systems were shipped since their introduction three months
ago,'' he continued. At the high end, shipment of VAX 8000 Nautilus
systems exceeded 3,000 for the year.''

<HEAD>Stock Prices Higher, Dollar Falls In Early Tokyo Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the Japanese
yen in early trading Thursday, while stock prices continued a
two-day upswing.
   The dollar, which fell 0.80 yen to close at 131.65 in New York
overnight, opened in Tokyo at 131.67 yen, down 0.83 yen from
Wednesday's close.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rose 117.85 points to 27,856.42 early Thursday,
following a gain of 434.81 points on Wednesday.
   Exchange dealers said growing concern about inflation in the
United States following Wednesday's release of second-quarter
figures for the U.S. second quarter gross national product
pressured the dollar lower.
   The U.S. gross national product, the broadest measure of an
economy's health, grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter, down
slightly from the revised 3.4 percent rate the previous quarter.
   But inflation registered the biggest advance since the third
quarter of 1982, rising at a 4.7 percent annual pace.
   Securities analysts dismissed the influence of the dollar's fall
on the stock market.
   ``In today's directionless market, share prices are determined
solely based on the supply-demand relationship,'' said Keiichi
Nishida of Kidder Peabody. ``You can't apply the same old principle
of `When the dollar falls, stock market also falls' any longer.''

<HEAD>South Korea Current Account Surplus Up 31.7 Percent In First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's overall current account
surplus ballooned by 31.7 percent in the first half of this year,
although its surplus with the United States shrank by 14.8 percent,
the Bank of Korea reported Thursday.
   The nation posted a $1.28 billion surplus for the month of June,
up from $993 million in June 1987. The record monthly surplus
boosted South Korea's first half surplus to $6.06 billion from $4.6
billion a year earlier.
   Officials at the central bank predicted the surplus likely would
top $10 billion by year end, above the government's recent
projection of $8.5 billion and last year's record $9.85 billion.
   Officials attributed the growing surplus mainly to continued
strong exports.
   The country's trade balance showed a surplus of $1.03 billion in
June, compared with $823 million in the same month last year, the
officials said.
   The trade surplus in the January-June period rose to $4.73
billion from a year ago's $3.42 billion. Korea's global exports in
the first half soared 28.1 percent to $27 billion and imports rose
26.1 percent to $22.3 billion.
   But Korea's trade surplus with the United States in the first
six months shrank to $3.91 billion from $4.59 billion a year
earlier, as Korean imports from that market rose at a much faster
rate than its exports to that country.
   Imports from the United States jumped 43 percent to $5.63
billion while exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent to
$9.54 billion.
   The officials said Korea's trade deficit with Japan in the
January-June period fell to $2.12 billion from $2.98 billion a year
earlier.
   The Korean government's trade policy calls for increased imports
from the United States and fewer from Japan, to try and avoid trade
friction with the United States.
   Washington has been pressuring Seoul to give America more access
to the Korean market to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.

<TEXT>
   Pullman Co., which has accepted a $324.7
million buyout offer from a management-led group, said Wednesday it
had received a competing $387.6 million offer from the investment
firm Forstmann, Little & Co.
   Forstmann Little said in a letter to Pullman that it would pay
$9.25 per share to acquire the company's estimatd 41.9 million
outstanding common shares.
   It conditioned the offer on Pullman terminating the pending bid,
announced July 11, in which an investor group led by senior
management and Henley Manufcturing Corp. agreed to acquired the
company for $7.75 per share.
   Pullman officials said in a news release that they will study
the Forstmann Little offer and will act on it promptly.
   Pullman stock closed unchanged at $7.50 a share Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange. The Forstmann Little offer was disclosed
after the market closed.
   Forstmann Little specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a
company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with
money raised by the target company's cash flow or the sale of its
assets.
   The management-led group, which includes Pullman chairman and
chief executive Thomas M. Begel, already has indicated it would
sell a number of the company's businesses and divisions to pay off
debt incurred in its buyout.
   The group's tender offer represented an increase from its
initial proposal of a $7.50 per share buyout, announced July 6.
   Pullman is a diversified manufacturer of industrial and
engineered component products, including truck trailers, aircraft
seating, food service equipment, weapons systems components, refuse
disposal equipment and fluid handling systems.
   Henley is Pullman's biggest shareholder, with about 9 percent of
the company's outstanding stock.
