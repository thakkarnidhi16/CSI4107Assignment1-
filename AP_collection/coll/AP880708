   Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned
Friday with Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, saying ``I'm pondering'' him
as a potential vice presidential candidate, as aides sought a new
meeting with Jesse Jackson on the same subject.
   Dukakis said as he began a Western trip into GOP territory that
he aimed to show ``this son of Massachusetts ... will not concede
one single state to the Republicans in this presidential election.''
   A senior aide traveling with Dukakis, Kirk O'Donnell,
acknowledged, however, that Dukakis' message on economic
opportunity was being obscured by attention focused on the question
of whom he would choose as his running mate. The Texas appearance
with Bentsen was similar to Dukakis campaign appearances recently
with other prospective running mates, including Sen. John Glenn in
Ohio and Rep. Lee Hamilton in Indiana.
   Dukakis then flew to Los Angeles where he went to Dodger Stadium
for Friday night's Dodger-Pirates baseball game, visited the locker
room and joined Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., in box seats along
the first-base side near home plate.
   While in Texas, Dukakis indicated at a news conference that he
favors some form of payments to the families of victims of the
Iranian airliner shot down by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf
last Sunday.
   ``I think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be
appropriate,'' he said.
   He also responded to Friday's report that the national
unemployment rate had fallen to a 14-year low _ good economic news
for Bush and the Republican administration _ by saying those
figures masked economic suffering.
   ``National unemployment rates don't tell you a great deal about
what is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regions
across this country,'' he said. ``For one thing, a great many of
these jobs are low-wage jobs, many of them paying no more than
$7,000, $7,500 a year. They don't have health insurance.''
   The same report also showed Massachusetts' unemployment rate
rose, from 2.8 percent to 3.5 percent in June, dropping the state
to second place after more than four years of having the lowest
rate among the nation's most populous states. Dukakis did not
mention that change, if he knew of it, and cited the lower figure
in his remarks in Texarkana.
   Both Dukakis and Bentsen, the Senate Finance Committee chairman,
gave little detail in response to questions about vice presidential
discussions, but Dukakis acknowledged the two ``have talked from
time to time on that.''
   At the same time, Dukakis senior adviser Paul Brountas, who is
leading the Massachusetts governor's search for a running mate, was
trying to arrange a meeting with Jackson, who this week has renewed
his contention that he is the most qualified prospect. Dukakis
repeated that Jackson remains under consideration.
   With less than two weeks to go before claiming the presidential
nomination at the Democratic National Convention, when he must
settle on a running mate, Dukakis faced more questions about that
choice as he began a campaign swing aimed at challenging George
Bush in Republican areas of the Southwest, the West and Rocky
Mountain regions.
   Bentsen, who is among eight Democrats interviewed previously by
Dukakis for the job, appeared with him at a rally in front of the
Texarkana post office straddling the Texas-Arkansas border, along
with Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers and Gov. Bill Clinton, who will
nominate Dukakis at the Atlanta convention.
   Dukakis praised Bentsen as Finance Committee chairman and, when
asked if Bentsen would be more valuable remaining in the Senate,
replied: ``I'm pondering. He could make a great contribution in
this county in many, many ways. He already has.''
   Bentsen declined to answer most questions, but replied when
asked if he wanted the job, ``I don't think we have to worry about
that.''
   Dukakis renewed his criticism of Bush for opposing legislation
requiring 60 days notice to workers before plants are closed,
saying it is ``probably the single most dramatic example of the
difference between our parties.''
   Back in Boston, the Legislature sent to Dukakis' desk an $11.75
billion budget for fiscal 1989. Lawmakers finished a 13{-hour
debate on the budget early Friday, sending the spending plan to
Dukakis seven days after the new budget year technically began July
1.
   GOP legislators had a heydey debating the compromise budget,
which was hastily revised amid falling revenue predictions. ``This
could be the greatest gift that George Bush could receive between
now and November _ it is so absurdly out of balance,'' said
Republican Sen. David Locke, a Bush campaign official.

   Rescuers used cherry-pickers, crowbars
and their bare hands Friday to burrow through tons of rubble from a
collapsed department store, pulling out six ``miracle'' survivors
in a race with rain, 90-degree heat and dehydration.
   The death toll in the Thursday afternoon collapse of the Amigo
Store rose to 15 late Friday night when three more bodies were
spotted in the debris, and more were feared dead. Eleven bodies
were removed, 10 of those identified, and four other bodies
remained under the rubble, said police Sgt. Dean Poos.
   At least 47 were injured, and officials feared anyone still
buried alive would not survive.
   ``Right now, hope is all that is driving the rescue effort. That
is fading as time goes by,'' said police Lt. Victor Rodriguez.
   Because of the 90-degree heat, ``at this point, the greatest
danger to the people in that building is if we don't get to them.
The people, if they are in a trapped area, don't have any access to
fluids,'' said Dr. Richard Plantes.
   Work crews limited to 30-miute shifts to prevent dehydration
were using front-end loaders and other heavy equipment. A yellow
and white canopy shaded what once had been a three-story,
30,000-square-foot store.
   A new worry arose in the afternoon as clouds rolled in from the
east, threatening a repeat of torrential rains that caused the roof
to cave in.
   ``We don't want to go in there and find somebody drowned,'' said
Poos.
   The rescue crews also worried that the one remaining wall, along
an alley, would collapse if they worked too fast.
   Rescuers planned to work through the night Friday under portable
lights, Poos said.
   The crews could be heard cheering occasionally when they thought
they heard heard noise within the debris, but Poos said the sounds
did not lead to finding any more survivors.
   ``We've had many situations when they thought they heard things,
and it turns out to be nothing,'' he said. ``We've got a lot of
people out there who have been working real hard for a long time,
and the slightest thing that will give them hope can set cheers
off.''
   ``It's frustrating because you want to go in there and tear
everything out. But you need to take into consideration that if you
tear things out, you endanger the people in there,'' said Mayor
Ygnacio Garza.
   Six survivors _ one a screaming toddler _ were freed Friday
morning from the debris where they had been buried nearly a day.
The six were two adults; a boy and a girl, both 8; the toddler, a
girl about 2; and a 14-year-old girl.
   Cries from the children, feedback from microphones and seismic
tools, and dogs trained to search for humans led the rescue crews
to the survivors.
   Cheers and wild applause erupted from 300 onlookers as each
survivor was lifted from the sweltering tangle of concrete.
   The children had been terrified, said Richard Schwand, a Red
Cross nurse from Corpus Christi. ``As soon as one starts screaming,
it's kind of contagious. They all start going for it.''
   The scene grew quiet when electronic equipment was used.
Authorities cleared traffic for two square blocks and asked people
to shut down generators and engines so the microphones could pick
up even the slightest sound.
   The seismic equipment could detect a gentle tapping sound at
1,000 feet, said Jeff Kravitz, chief of mine safety operations with
the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration.
   Survivors _ if any _ were asked to tap 10 times by searchers
with loudspeakers, speaking in English and Spanish. But no taps
sounded, and other noise that would be expected from alert
survivors was absent, Kravitz said.
   Heavy equipment moved in, but Schwand said he feared only bodies
would be found now. ``It's just the smell,'' said Schwand.
``There's dead people under there and not just one, I'm sure.''
   The victims were presumed to have been in the store when its
roof caved in, taking the walls with it, after 2 inches of rain
fell in less than 30 minutes Thursday. The National Weather Service
said the collapse could have been caused by the weight of rain.
   The 2-year-old survivor ``appeared to have been protected by
some other people around her who are believed dead,'' said
Rodriguez.
   The 14-year-old was wedged between two concrete slabs. ``Every
time there's movement, the slabs hit her in the head,'' said Pamela
Downing of the city's public utilities board. She called the girl a
``miracle child'' for having survived.
   A Brownsville maintenance worker, Freddie Gonzalez, 34, took
advantage of his 4-foot-8 frame to snake his way through the heaps
of concrete, widening a path for two workers who followed.
   ``It was a little bit hot,'' Gonzalez said. ``The people were
running out of oxygen. That was their major complaint. We ran a
little tube through a small hole. Then we made a bigger hole and
put in a bigger pipe'' to get air to the victims.
   Other rescuers dug a makeshift 17-foot tunnel to reach some of
those trapped. Doctors reached in to check vital signs of the
victims, said Johnny Economedes, head of one rescue team.
   Among those injured slightly was store owner Bernard Levin, 67,
who was working a cash register at the time.
   ``It was a well-built building and we still don't know what
caused it to collapse,'' Levin said.
   The 40-year-old concrete structure housed the store on the first
floor, with the other two floors vacant, Economedes said.

   A stockbroker who quit his job to open a
beekeeping business died from an allergic reaction to two bee
stings, his family said.
   Richard Nauditt, who quit his office job with Merrill Lynch in
late December, was found on June 19, Father's Day, said his wife,
Lauri Nauditt.
   ``He always wanted to own his own business, and this was
something that excited him,'' Mrs. Nauditt said recently.
   ``He had never been stung until April,'' she said. ``The week
before he died he was stung once and his finger swelled up,'' but
he didn't think anything about it.
   Nationally, 41 people died from insect stings in 1985, the last
year for which national figures are known, according to the
Washington Department of Vital Statistics.

<HEAD>Law Requires Comfortable Seating in Senior Citizen Apartment
Lobbies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A city councilman stood up for senior
citizens who want to sit down, and the result was a law requiring
comfortable seating in the lobbies of most apartment buildings for
the elderly.
   The city ordinance guarantees that the elderly who ``want to see
something beyond their four walls'' have a place to go, officials
said Thursday. The law requires lounge chairs, sofas or benches
with backs to be padded.
   Complaints by senior citizens prompted the City Council to pass
the ordinance for all subsidized buildings with at least 30
residents, said Maynard Banks, the deputy director of the Jersey
City Housing Authority.
   Glenn Cunningham, the president of the City Council, said he
sponsored the law because one building replaced comfortable seats
with hard benches in an effort to discourage senior citizens from
congregating.
   ``They claimed they'd have to clean the area but I felt it was
very insensitive,'' Cunningham said. ``Many seniors have back
ailments. And if you're waiting for a bus, it can be painful to sit
down for a half-hour. It was cruel and unfair.''
   ``We were in full agreement with the law,'' said Maria Maio,
director of development in the city's housing and economic
development department. ``Seniors like to sit in the lobby or
outside. ... That's where the action is.''
   You bet, said Josephine Rice, president of the senior citizens
club at the Plaza Apartments.
   ``They enjoy the lounge,'' Ms. Rice said, leaving her card game
in the lobby. ``That's where they watch TV. We also play bingo
there.''
   Apartment manager Mary Johnson likes the law but suspects
comfortable seating also means she has to watch her step in the
lobby of her building.
   ``They're parked there all day,'' Ms. Johnson said with a laugh.
``They like to see who's coming in and going out. It's the best
place to be to watch what everybody is doing.''

   Authorities have released 390 people
arrested in student riots in March and June, the state radio said.
   The broadcast said those freed Thursday included 229 students,
147 civilians and 14 government employees. It said 240 people were
freed in the national capital of Rangoon and the others in the
cities of Pegu, Prome and Moulmein.
   The broadcast said some people were freed unconditionally and
others on bail. It did not say how many people had been arrested,
but it said releases will continue.
   In the most recent riots in Rangoon on June 21, university
students demanded that the government legalize student unions and
free students detained in earlier protests.
   Authorities said nine people were killed when thousands of
demonstrators clashed with riot police. Seventy-seven people were
arrested in connection with that riot, they said.
   Authorities closed most educational institutions and imposed a
curfew until Aug. 17.

<HEAD>Miera Announces End To Fast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Hispanic, bisexual judge who promised
to fast 100 days to protest discrimination announced through a
priest he was ending his fast on its 58th day Thursday.
   Ramsey County Judge Alberto Miera Jr.'s decision came two days
after the Minnesota Supreme Court publicly censured and suspended
him for one year withou pay for forcibly kissing his male court
reporter and other alleged misconduct.
   Earlier, a civil court jury found the judge had committed
battery in his alleged advances on the reporter, Neil K. Johnson.
   The 37-year-old Miera declared Thursday he had accomplished the
goals he had announced in May when he said he was beginning a
100-day fast to protest discrimination of ``socially vulnerable''
people by society and the local judiciary.
   ``I am committed to working hard on these issues and steadfast
in contributing my efforts to make our system fairer and more
accessible to all citizens,'' said Miera's statement. It was read
by the Rev. Jerry Hackenmueller to reporters and about 50 people,
mostly parishioners, in a church meeting room.
   Miera was not present for the announcement at Our Lady of
Guadalupe Church, where he has attended Masses.
   Miera's father, Alberto Miera Sr., said his son would be unable
to address the media for at least several days because he is
getting medical attention.
   ``It is now a time of healing for our family,'' the elder Miera
said.
   In the statement, the suspended judge said, in part: ``Because
of the accomplishment of a primary goal of my fast, that is the
serious raising of public awareness to the differential treatment
of socially vulnerable people within our system ... and the
specific recognition and rebuke of the unprecedented and improper
actions of some of my colleagues by the Supreme Court, I am ending
my fast.''
   The latter part of that portion of his statement referred to
comments the Supreme Court made in its ruling Tuesday about other
Ramsey County judges. The Supreme Court said they should have taken
their concerns about Miera to the state Board on Judicial
Standards, rather than using the ``unorthodox method'' of
petitioning the state's high court and making statements to the
news media.
   The Supreme Court also rejected a recommendation from the state
Board on Judicial Standards that Miera be removed from office.
   The fast's end was applauded by the priest and parishioners,
some of whom said they had fasted in hopes of persuading the judge
to eat again.
   ``I'm joyful he's finally gotten off that fast,'' said Mona
Capiz. ``I was supporting his issues, but I don't think they are
accomplished (by a fast). That's for him to finish up now that he's
off it.''
   Capiz and Hackenmueller said the fast has strengthened Miera's
credibility in the Hispanic community and brought its members
closer together.
   ``I think it certainly has created a new awareness that we have
to be constantly on guard against injustices,'' the priest said.

<TEXT>
   Older children are most likely to be hit by cars
when crossing the street, but children under 5 are especially at
risk of being hit and killed in parking lots or in their own
driveways, researchers report.
   ``The `typical' pattern of injury involved a situation in which
a 1-to-2-year old child was backed over in his home driveway by a
light truck or van driven by a family member,'' the researchers
write.
   The researchers studied 71 cases in Washington state in which
children under five were hit and killed by motor vehicles, said the
study's principal author, Dr. Robert J. Brison of Queen's
University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.
   Thirty of the 71 deaths occurred in driveways and 11 in parking
lots. The remaining 30 occurred in traffic, Brison said.
   In cases in which the kind of vehicle had been reported, 76
percent involved a light truck or van.
   ``Older children are injured and die from darting out into
traffic,'' said Brison. ``Younger children seem not to have that
pattern of injury. They seem to be injured most commonly in a home
driveway or in a store parking lot.''
   Brison, who practices emergency medicine at Kingston General
Hospital, said in a telephone interview Thursday that parents of
young children ``need to be aware of this pattern of injury, so
that they can put the children in a safe area, such as a playpen,
or pick them up'' before backing out of the driveway.
   The study by Brison, Kristine Wicklund of the Washington state
health department and Beth Mueller of the University of Washington
appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Public
Health.
   ``It's a very good article,'' said Richard Waxweiler, chief of
injury epidemiology at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta. ``And what it brings up to me as one important point is
that we mainly think of motor vehicle safety as being under the
purview of the Department of Transportation, and yet they only deal
with traffic injuries. And so they're missing these.
   ``And yet they have the jurisdiction over automobile design, for
instance, and Brison and co-authors clearly brought up that
automobile design is a potential risk factor that deserves further
investigation.''
   Brison and his collaborators suggested it might be possible to
design vehicles, especially light trucks and vans, to offer more
visibility in the rear.
   The National Center for Health Statistics says that in 1985, the
latest year for which statistics are available, 7,157 pedestrians
were killed in traffic accidents, including 401 children under 5
years old.
   Waxweiler said there were 430 pedestrians of all ages reported
killed in non-traffic situations in 1985.

<HEAD>Fitzwater Says U. S. Will Do Right Thing on Compensation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 18th graf pvs bgng, `In the,' to UPDATE
with report that Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman denies that Iran
recently attempted to open dialogue with the United States</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Humane and moral'' considerations will
figure heavily in the decision on compensation to the victims of
the Iranian airliner tragedy, President Reagan's chief spokesman
said Thursday.
   In the strongest hint yet that the administration might support
compensation for the destruction of the plane and the death of its
290 occupants Sunday, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I suspect
that doing what we think is right will be the deciding factor.''
   The comment came amid revelations that two Iranians tried
unsuccessfully several times to open a diplomatic dialogue between
Tehran and Washington in recent months.
   Fitzwater emphasized that the compensation matter is under staff
review and has not yet even gone to senior advisers or the
president. He said it was ``under active discussion,'' and he
declined to outline any timetable for the decision.
   But in contrast to his suggestion earlier this week that the
question would have to await the outcome of the Navy's
investigation of the incident, Fitzwater said he wanted to
emphasize that ``we're moving along through the consideration
process'' on the issue of compensation.
   ``One of the driving forces behind our consideration is simply
the moral responsibility of America and the fact that we've always
been a humane nation that takes these kinds of problems very
seriously and assumes personal responsibilities,'' he said.
   ``America has traditionally been a humane and moral nation who
assumes those responsibilities.''
   The spokesman said there has been ``no response at all'' from
Iran to Reagan's message on Sunday, when he explained the shootdown
of the Iran Air jetliner by a missile from the USS Vincennes was an
accident and expressed ``deep regret.''
   He said the administration would be ``deliberate'' in its
considerations and would ``opt for more time, and not less'' in
reaching the decision.
   Asked if there was any ``dollar figure'' under discussion,
Fitzwater said, ``We aren't willing to discuss any dollar figure.''
   Meanwhile, a U.S official said an Iranian deputy foreign
minister and an Iranian-born scholar tried several times over the
last few months to open a diplomatic dialogue with the United
States, but so far the initiatives have not panned out.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Larijani sent a probing
message through a U.N. official in April, while the scholar, whose
identify was not disclosed, approached the Reagan administration
twice, saying he represented Iranian authorities, the U.S. official
told The Associated Press.
   In response to Larijani's overture, the administration asked for
proof that he had the approval of the entire Iranian government,
and ``it never got off the ground,'' said the official, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   Apparently alluding to the Iran-Contra scandal, the official
said ``We wanted to make sure we weren't burned.''
   Meanwhile, Phyllis Oakley, the deputy State Department
spokeswoman, stressed the United States remained interested in a
dialogue with Tehran.
   ``Our position still holds,'' she said. ``We are prepared to
meet with an Iranian who speaks authoritatively for his
government.''
   Some analysts view Larijani as an ally of the relatively
moderate speaker of Iran's parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, but not
as a representative of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini`s
fundamentalist government.
   In the case of the scholar, a native-born Iranian, the Reagan
administration also could not authenticate that his two probing
messages had the support of the Iranian government, the U.S.
official who spoke anonymously said.
   A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry on Thursday denied that
Iran recently tried to open direct talks with Washington, according
to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   The unidentified spokesman described such claims as ``futile
efforts'' to divert world public attention from the destruction of
the airliner.
   The U.S. downing of the Iranian passenger jet led to revelations
that the United States had tried to discuss ending the Persian Gulf
war and other problems despite a nine-year break in relations and
the continued plight of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   Operating through the Swiss and other intermediaries, especially
at the United Nations, the administration attempted to find out if
the Iranians were willing to talk.
   Relations with Tehran were broken in 1979 after the U.S. embassy
was sacked and its American occupants were taken hostage for more
than a year.
   The Reagan administration also holds pro-Iranian forces in
Lebanon responsible for the nine American hostages in that war-torn
country.
   ``We certainly couldn't expect to have a normal relationship
with Iran while American hostages are still being held, while the
war continues between Iran and Iraq, and, certainly, while Iran
maintains its present position of supporting terrorism and
violence,'' Mrs. Oakley said Wednesday.
   However, she acknowledged ``various indirect messages'' had been
passed to Iran, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz told
reporters traveling with him to Asia that ``we've had a number of
these probes ... from Iran through various third parties saying
that they'd like to talk with us, and we've responded to those.''

Kalampang says he has never worn anything but what he was wearing
when he was born 50 years ago, the newspaper Kompas reported.
   A reporter found Aco, who goes by one name, nude last Sunday at
his home in the village 1,000 miles northeast of the capital, the
paper said Thursday.
   ``My body will itch very badly if I wear any clothes or
sarong,'' Kompas quoted Aco as saying.
   It quoted a neighbor as saying that when Aco was a baby, he
protested and cried whenever his mother tried to put clothes on him.
   A doctor checked the man this week and found him physically and
mentally healthy, the paper said.

   George Bush campaigned behind enemy lines on Thursday with a
foray into Massachusetts, while Michael Dukakis charged the vice
president with favoring $7 billion in new taxes and said, ``so much
for iron-clad no-tax commitments.''
   Dukakis, who will fly to Atlanta in 10 days to claim the
Democratic presidential nomination, also said Bush had made a
``rather late commitment'' when he said Wednesday that he would
name a Hispanic American to his Cabinet.
   Before leaving on a Western campaign swing, the Massachusetts
governor added that he would select a running mate ``in the not too
distant future,'' but did nothing else to clarify the reigning
mystery of the presidential campaign.
   Bush, whose own nomination is set for the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans next month, flew to Dukakis' political
base of Boston. There he met with Bay State Republicans and spoke
to leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church, which counts Dukakis among
its followers.
   The vice president got a warm reception from the Greek group,
which had heard a day earlier from Dukakis. Bush said it was just
as well they didn't appear together.
   ``Too much charisma can be dangerous to your health,'' he said
to laughter.
   The vice president met with President Reagan before leaving
Washington, and the two men directed their aides to work closely to
maximize Bush's chances of victory in the fall. Presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also disclosed that Reagan may campaign
on Bush's behalf in California when he vacations there this summer.
   California, the nation's largest state with 47 electoral votes,
is Reagan's home. But Bush has fared poorly there in polls, and his
aides are eager to cut into Dukakis' presumed lead in the state.
   Reagan is expected to campaign two days a week for Bush
beginning in the fall, and Bush said Thursday the two would
probably make some joint appearances.
   ``The president feels he can be especially helpful with
conservative Republicans, Democrats and other key groups which are
not registered Republicans, but which have voted for the
Reagan-Bush ticket in '80 and '84,'' said Fitzwater.
   Reagan will be at his California ranch during the Democratic
convention, but Bush said he himself may campaign during the first
two days of the convention, hoping to ``get a little bit of ink''
in the news media during Dukakis' big week.
   In addition to his trip to Massachusetts, Bush dispatched New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu to Washington for a news conference
designed to tar Dukakis.
   Sununu said tens of thousands of ``refugees'' are fleeing
Massachusetts and Dukakis' administration each year and moving to
New Hampshire.
   ``If Michael Dukakis fulfills his promise to do for the rest of
the nation what he did for Massachusetts, then we are in serious
trouble,'' he said.
   Dukakis has seemed to lose the political momentum in recent
weeks, and he sought to regain it with his charge that Bush had
forsaken his pledge to oppose any type of tax increase.
   He said the vice president supports a provision in trade
legislation that calls for $1 billion in taxes for job training
programs and also supports recently signed catastrophic illness
health-care legislation with $6 billion in new taxes.
   ``So much for iron-clad no-tax commitments,'' Dukakis said of
the centerpiece of Bush's campaign.
   Bush, in Boston, replied by making reference to Dukakis' signing
of a cigarette tax and his support for another tax measure.
   ``I'm against raising taxes, and I think recent events here in
this state that I don't plan to go into demonstrate we have a
different view on taxes,'' he said.
   The Bush campaign also quarreled with Dukakis' assertion about
the trade legislation and the catastrophic illiness health-care
legislation.
   ``He is dead wrong on both counts and he is trying to blow smoke
into the room,'' said spokesman Mark Goodin.
   In his home state, Dukakis said he expected to conclude work by
the middle of next week on legislation to wipe out a looming budget
deficit for the 1988 fiscal year, and on a package of tax increases
and spending cuts for next year.
   Dukakis has been criticized repeatedly by Bush for agreeing to a
new cigarette tax and other measures as part of the budget plan,
for a total of $250 million in additional taxes and fees.
   Dukakis also scoffed at Bush's pledge before a Hispanic group in
Texas to name a Hispanic member to the Cabinet.
   ``It strikes me that this is a rather late commitment,'' said
Dukakis, who made a similar pledge a year ago. ``I don't know where
he has been for the last eight years.''
   Later, in Dallas, Dukakis spoke before the same group Bush had
addressed a day earlier, and again jabbed at Bush over the pledge
to appoint a Hispanic member of the Cabinet.
   ``Some people think it's enough to wake up after eight years and
then promise opportunity for one Hispanic. I want to stand with you
and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanic citizens across the
country,'' he said.
   Dukakis also resurrected the issue of Reagan's veto of
plant-closing legislation, using it against Bush.
   ``The president opposes it, the vice president opposes it, I
don't know why.'' He said workers deserved the 60-day notice the
legislation would provide before a plant could be closed and said
the issue represented ``the fundamental difference in what a
Democratic administration would mean to this country.''

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's half-brother has filed a $20
million lawsuit against NBC and a reporter at a local network-owned
television station, contending he was libeled by a report that he
had ordered a killing.
   The libel action by businessman Noah R. Robinson seeks $10
million each in damages from the network and reporter Peter Karl at
WMAQ-TV, citing reports about a December 1987 attack on a South
Carolina woman.
   WMAQ News Director Dick Reingold declined to comment on the
lawsuit Thursday, saying he had not seen it. There was no one
available to comment for NBC at the network's New York media
relations office after business hours Thursday.
   Robinson of Chicago, half-brother of the Democratic presidential
candidate, also filed a $1 million lawsuit against U.S. News and
World Report Inc. in Cook County Circuit Court on Wednesday.
   He said while the magazine reported he had been arrested by the
FBI, the federal agency did not take part in his arrest and he was
not charged with a federal crime.
   C. Thomas Dienes, general counsel for U.S. News in Washington,
D.C., said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
   Robinson, 45, is free on bond after his arrest June 4 in
Greenville, S.C., where he and Jackson were born, on charges of
conspiracy, intimidation of a witness, obstruction of justice and
being an accessory to a felony.
   The charges stem from the stabbing of Janice Denise Rosemond,
who survived an attack in her Greenville apartment in December 1987.
   Robinson was charged with hiring the person who attacked her,
Greenville police have said.
   Authorities have said Ms. Rosemond was a witness to the murder
of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber, a former employee of Robinson's who
was shot in 1986 outside a building owned by Robinson.
   They said she identified the man who shot Barber, but recanted
her testimony afer she was stabbed.
   In his lawsuit against NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in Chicago, Robinson
says a June 7 report aired by the station ``falsely, wrongfully and
maliciously accused (Robinson) of having participated in the murder
of Leroy `Hambone' Barber.''
   The suit labeled the newscast ``false and untruthful in that
Janice Rosemond never told a federal grand jury or anyone else that
plaintiff (Robinson) had ordered the murder of Leroy ``Hambone''
Barber.''
   Robinson has said that the charges against him are politically
motivated, noting Jackson's presidential bid.
   Jackson and Robinson have the same father, but their
relationship has been rocky. In 1987, Jackson was quoted as saying
``I have no connection with him,'' following reports of an
investigation to determine whether Robinson had broken federal
bankruptcy laws.

<HEAD>Many Heart Attack Victims Can Return To Work Sooner Than Doctors
Think</HEAD>

   Despite medical advances, heart attack victims
still take as much time to get back to work today as they did 15
years ago, says a new study that finds many patients could return
to their jobs earlier.
   Medical discoveries have shown that heart attack patients often
benefit from getting up and around sooner, being released from the
hospital earlier and exercising, said authors of the study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Even so, heart attack patients generally take 60 days to 90 days
to get back to work, and ``physicians' recommendations concerning
return to work are largely based on subjective judgments that have
changed little since 1973,'' the study said.
   The study, led by Dr. Charles Dennis of the Stanford Cardiac
Rehabilitation Program in Palo Alto, Calif., evaluated 201 men who
had suffered heart attacks without other medical problems. Subjects
were divided into two groups: those receiving usual care and those
receiving a special medical evaluation to determine fitness for
work.
   Evaluations were performed three weeks after the patient's heart
attack by a team of heart experts who administered a treadmill test
and used data on previous victims to estimate the risk each subject
would have of experiencing further heart trouble.
   The team then advised each patient's doctor of the findings so
the doctor could make a more informed recommendation on when the
patient could resume work.
   The study found that unless otherwise informed, doctors
generally estimated risk as much higher than it was and ``patients'
perceptions of risk mirrored those of their doctors.''
   For instance, doctors typically estimated patients in the study
had a 20 percent chance of suffering another fatal or non-fatal
heart attack within six months, while heart-team evaluations
typically found a 5 percent risk and the real risk turned out to be
3.5 percent, the researchers said.
   Patients in the usual-care group were told by their doctors they
could go back to work at 60 days and did so at a median of 75 days,
the study said.
   Patients in the special-evaluation group were told by their
doctors they could return at 48 days, and did so at a median of 51
days, representing a 32 percent reduction in the convalescent
period, the study said.
   ``This 32 percent reduction ... was associated with $2,102 of
additional earned salary'' per patient in the six months after the
heart attack, the researchers said.
   The study found no significant difference in the rate of
subsequent heart attacks or other heart trouble between the two
groups.
   Patients performing manual labor returned to work no later than
those performing sedentary jobs or light-physical labor, the
researchers said.
   Previous studies have shown that among mployed patients who
classify as ``low-risk'' heart-attack victims, the advice of
physicians and the patient's own beliefs about his health are the
most important factors in governing when that patient returns to
work.
   The researchers estimated that half of the 800,000 heart-attack
cases each year could be considered ``low-risk,'' that is, they are
not accompanied by other medical problems and the patient has less
than a 10 percent chance of suffering another fatal or non-fatal
heart attack within a year.
   ``Patients who have ... an uncomplicated heart attack quite
possibly can have a more rapid recovery than is allowed,'' Dennis
said in a telephone interview Thursday.

<HEAD>Hodel Only Attacks Democrats Backing Bill, Not Republicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel is waging a
letter-writing campaign harshly critical of House Democrats
supporting legislation to protect a national battleground, but
Republicans backing the same bill are noticeably absent from his
target list.
   A spokesman for Hodel said Thursday that the only reason 29
Republican co-sponsors of the bill escaped his scorn is that the
targets were selected in ``haphazard'' fashion.
   Letters sent by Hodel to 13 newspapers in the home districts of
the Democrats say they should be ``ashamed'' of themselves for
backing a ``ludicrous'' plan to protect the Manassas National
Battlefield Park from nearby development.
   Hodel opposes the bill drafted by Reps. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that would require the Interior
Department to acquire land now owned by a developer who plans a
shopping center, office buildings and residential units next to the
Civil War battlefield in Virginia.
   Critics say the massive development would destroy the
still-rustic feeling of the 4,600-acre battleground.
   Interior Department spokesman David Prosperi confirmed Thursday
that seven House Democrats had been singled out in letters by
Hodel, but denied that the secretary was targeting only Democrats.
   ``The selection was done in a very haphazard manner,'' Prosperi
said. ``If we had had time, we would have sent (letters) to
everyone _ Republicans and Democrats.''
   Prosperi said letters from Hodel criticizing the measure were
sent to 13 newspapers in the congressional districts of Andrews and
Mrazek, as well as Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Georgia, Bill
Richardson of New Mexico, James Clarke of North Carolina, Robert
Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, Jim Slattery of Kansas and Barbara
Kennelly of Connecticut.
   The letters were published in some of the papers in late May and
throughout June.
   In a letter to the Houston Chronicle, which appeared on May 27,
Hodel wrote: ``Andrews ought to be ashamed of himself because he is
playing politics with the future of Manassas Battlefield. It is
easy enough to grab an issue in Washington in order to gain media
attention, but the congressman's idea that the solution here is to
buy that land adjacent to the battlefield ... is ludicrous.''
   Nearly identical language, substituting only the name of the
congressman, appeared in the June 9 editions of Long Island Newsday
(published in Mrazek's district), the June 16 issues of the Atlanta
Daily World (Lewis' district), and the June 28 editions of the
Wisconsin State Journal (Kastenmeier's district).
   ``It's clear that Mr. Hodel's actions have become extremely
partisan,'' said Mrazek. ``I found the harshness of the letter
surprising.''
   While both Andrews and Mrazek were lambasted by Hodel,
Republican co-sponsors of their bill from neighboring congressional
districts escaped the interior secretary's scorn.
   Hodel favors a plan that would allow the shopping mall to be
built next to the battlefield park, but would close two roads
running through the battlefield to reduce the effect of traffic
heading to and from the complex.
   The development-control bill has 200 co-sponsors, including 29
Republicans. The Associated Press contacted 25 of the Republicans,
all of whom said newspapers in their districts had not printed
letters from Hodel.
   The letter-writing campaign especially angered Andrews, since
two Republican congressmen from districts adjacent to his Houston
district co-sponsored the legislation but were not singled out by
Hodel.
   ``Jack Fields (a Republican congressman from Houston) feels
strongly about this issue, but Hodel didn't mention him,'' Andrews
said. ``The secretary of the interior does not serve himself well
when he uses a blistering attack on people who disagree with him.
It's disappointing.''

   Huge rock formations on Mars that resemble a
human face, a pyramid and a fortress could be the work of a lost
civilization or ``just a trick of nature,'' say scientists urging a
close-up look at the outcroppings.
   Four scientists including a former astronaut said Thursday that
the mysterious formations should be scrutinized further by
spacecraft.
   Photographs taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 spacecraft as it
orbited Mars show a sphinx-like face staring outward into space.
The image resembles a death mask, with a long shadow obscuring one
side of the face while emphasizing a human-like brow, nose, eye
socket and mouth.
   Nearby is an angular mountain, suggesting the sharp lines of a
pyramid, and a grouping of rocks that some view as a fortress near
the center of what they suggest could have been an ancient city of
a lost civilization.
   Or, the scientists said at a news conference Thursday, the
images captured by the Viking camera could all be ``a trick of
light and shadow.''
   ``We have found something that is so interesting that it demands
we go back to Mars and get more data,'' said Richard C. Hoagland,
founder of The Mars Project, an organization that is studying the
Viking photographs.
   Brian T. O'Leary, a former astronaut and an expert on Mars, said
there is so much uncertainty about the origin of the rock face that
it should be a major target for future spacecraft sent to Mars.
   ``The feature is sufficiently exciting that we must go back to
Mars and photograph it at a higher resolution,'' said O'Leary.
   Gerald Soffel, the mission scientist on the Viking project and
currently chief of the space and Earth sciences branch at the
Goddard Space Center, said in a telephone interview that the
face-like image captured by the camera has been dismissed by most
scientists as an illusion caused by bright sunlight and shadow.
   He said some of the world's finest geologists have examined the
photos and ``they said what we were seeing is light and shadow.''
   But Mark Carlotto, an optical engineering expert, said a new,
sophisticated computer study of the photos suggests that the face
and other formations are not of natural origin.
   In an article published in Applied Optics, Carlotto said a
computer enhancement of the Viking photographs shows the rock
shapes appear to have been carved by ``intelligent design'' and not
by the random forces of nature.
   In one study, Carlotto said, the face was compared statistically
with other shapes photographed on Mars, and he concluded that ``the
face is not natural.''
   ``It's extremely unlikely that it's a trick of light and
shadow,'' said Carlotto.
   Soffel said he planned to study Carlotto's paper. He said its
publication in Applied Optics, a learned journal supervised by
scientists who evaluate each submission, gives credibility to the
work.
   But he said Viking scientists first spotted the face in 1976 and
``never took it seriously.''
   ``NASA has never taken a position that it is nonsense or
science,'' he said. ``But I admit that NASA has not shown much
interest.''
   The Carlotto study was published in May, but Hoagland did not
call the news conference until Thursday, the same day that the
Soviet Union launched a probe toward Mars.
   O'Leary said Soviet scientists showed great interest in the Mars
formations when he talked with them in January, but was told their
spacecraft was not technically designed for such a survey of the
Cydonia region of Mars where the structures are located.
   Hoagland said NASA scientists dismissed the images found in the
photographs as oddities of no significance, or ``a trick of
nature.''
   Hoagland, however, said he has studied the photos for years and
has discovered that in addition to the face there is ``a complex of
unusual objects'' that he believes could have been built by
``intelligent design.''
   The complex, which he calls a city, includes a five-sided
mountain that resembles a pyramid, a grouping of rocks that he said
could be a fortress and a bluff that he believes could have been
part of an astronomical marker.
   Hoagland said a line drawn from the center of the city, across
the face to the bluff, would line up exactly with the sun at the
moment of Mars' summer solstice, as it would have occurred 500,000
years ago. He said Mars has shifted on its axis since and that the
solstice angle now is different.
   ``Geologically, the odds are one in 300,000 that this would be
there by chance,'' said Hoagland.
   NASA plans to launch an unmanned probe, called the Mars
Observer, in five years, and Hoagland said it will have on board a
camera that could settle the question about the origin of the stone
features on the planet.
   Randolfo Pozos, executive director of The Mars Project, said
members of the organization are divided about the origin of the
face on Mars.
   ``Some of our group feel this is a lost civilization,'' he said.
``Others think it is just an interesting geologic formation.''

   Accusations of insider trading with a political
twist are rocking the dominant Liberal Democratic Party in the
latest scandal revealing the close ties between Japanese politics
and business.
   But experts say it is unlikely to hurt the LDP seriously despite
the participation of senior aides to Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and at least three men who want to be premier.
   The affair involves current or former private secretaries to
Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, LDP Secretary General
Shintaro Abe, ex-Premier Yasuhiro Nakasone and at least four other
ex-Cabinet ministers.
   The aides have been identified among 76 people who obtained
stocks of Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate and leasing company, at
discounts before the shares were issued publicly.
   ``This involves the most senior LDP officials, and there is
going to be a major outcry from the Japanese people,'' said Shigeru
Ito, a high-ranking official in the Japan Socialist Party, the No.
1 opposition party.
   ``Their obtaining stocks before they go on the market is unfair
and dirty,'' Ito told The Associated Press. ``Although they broke
no law, they abused their positions to line their pockets.
Political funding and the stock market are sure to be examined
now.''
   Under Japanese law, the stock deals were technically legal
because firms can determine to whom they sell shares and at what
price.
   Japan's major newspapers quoted informed sources as saying the
secretaries _ politicians' top aides and confidants _ made up to $1
million from sales of the stocks shortly after they were offered to
the public in 1986. The profits apparently were used for campaign
funds and not for personal gain.
   News commentators said the deals raised suspicions that the
company was trying to curry favor with the politicians. But so far
nothing has been proved.
   Fund-raising and gifts of money have long been the key to
success in Japanese politics. Senior lawmakers routinely pass out
envelopes stuffed with bills to their juniors to cultivate
parliamentary votes and support.
   In particular, stock market manipulation is a major revenue
source for politicians and it is rarely challenged, according to
Masayuki Fukuoka, a professor of political science at Tokyo's
Komazawa University.
   ``Money politics is so long-standing and deep-rooted in Japanese
politics that it is considered a necessary evil and seen as all
right as long as people aren't caught,'' Fukuoaka said.
   The scandal is likely to throw the next Diet (parliament)
session scheduled to discuss the LDP's tax plans into disarray as
opposition politicians attack the party on moral and ethical
grounds.
   ``People are going to be saying, `We pay consumer taxes, we pay
sales taxes, why should politicians get away with this?''' Fukuoka
said.
   The Recruit-Cosmos affair is the latest of several financial
quagmires to hit the LDP this year.
   Six people have been indicted since May for arranging bribes
offered by advertising agencies to gain public relations contracts
with the Prime Minister's Office.
   Last month, five executives of a Tokyo electronics firm who made
large donations to both the LDP and Japan Socialist Party were
arrested for evading income tax of $11.5 million earned from
illegal stock manipulations.
   Despite the furor, Takeshita and Abe, Miyazawa and LDP policy
chief Michio Watanabe, all prime contenders for Takeshita's job,
are likely to emerge unscathed.
   ``Takeshita's main political rivals are in his own party and are
all involved in the scandal. Takeshita has nothing to lose,''
prominent political critic Soichiro Tawara said in an interview.
   ``It's like cutting off a lizard's tail; it will just grow
back,'' Fukuoka said. ``They are all denying they knew anything and
blaming their secretaries. So they'll get new secretaries and
apologize, and life will go on.''
   In 1974, Japan's biggest postwar scandal did not destroy the
political career of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was
forced out of the premiership and the LDP over questionable land
dealings and was convicted in 1983 of accepting bribes from the
Lockheed Corp.
   He was Japan's most powerful politician until he suffered a
stroke in 1985. He remains a parliamentarian and is appealing his
conviction.
   The influential newspaper Asahi Shimbun, which broke the
Recruit-Cosmos story, said in an editorial, ``We find it hard to
believe that they really didn't know anything about the huge
profits they were making.''
   The paper noted that in Japan when a political scandal breaks,
the secretaries of politicians are invariably named as scapegoats.
   Two influential journalists also have been linked to the deals.
Ko Morita, president of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's most
prestigious financial newspaper, who stepped down Wednesday, and
Reizo Utagawa, former managing editor of the Mainichi Shimbun. Both
reportedly made massive profits from sales of Recruit-Cosmos stocks
they received.

   The Phoenix police chief denied Thursday
that his department maintained a computer list of suspected AIDS
carriers, although he acknowledged there were a few such notations
in the files.
   ``We do not have and we have never had a list,'' Chief Ruben
Ortega said in response to an article in The Arizona Republic
Thursday that said Phoenix police and Maricopa County sheriff's
officials both have maintained files on suspected AIDS carriers for
at least a year.
   Ortega said the department had launched an investigation to
determine how AIDS information was placed in some files. He said
the practice is unauthorized and speculated that officers who
requested AIDS information be entered into files do so because they
feel a need to warn other officers.
   Ortega denied the Republic's report that the police files were
purged of the AIDS information after inquiries were received from
the newspaper. The purge already had begun at that point, he said.
   Maricopa County sheriff's officials confirmed that they include
information on AIDS and any other contagious disease in individual
files when a person goes to jail. The information is based on what
officers are told by the inmates or on examinations, Capt. Frank
Waelde said.
   Jane Aiken, an Arizona State University law professor who
specializes in legal issues involving AIDS, said that maintaining
such files raises concerns about abuses of medical confidentiality
and the discrimination that could result.
   Bill MacDonald, chairman of the Phoenix-based Arizona AIDS
Project, a private organization, expressed similar concerns.
   ``It is outrageous that the Police Department has been carrying
that type of information in a person's records,'' MacDonald said.
``I thought there were laws that protect the rights of
individuals.''
   Mike Petchel, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement
Association, said officers need such information for their own
safety.
   ``Personally, I think it's an area that needs to be examined for
a policy, because officers feel they may be subjected to contact
with someone carrying an infectious disease,'' Petchel said.
   The number of names in the files was not known, nor was it clear
where police obtained the names.
   Chad Butt, a 45-year-old Phoenix man, told the Republic that he
learned in May that police computer files had the phrase ``High
risk: AIDS'' next to his name.
   Butts said he was told by police that the information came
``from the health department.''
   However, officials of the Maricopa County health department and
the Arizona Department of Health Services denied releasing names of
any of the more than 2,000 AIDS carriers on file in Arizona.

   From sax solos to Senegalese soul, a sizzling
stew of eclectic sounds is turning this French-Canadian city into
the New Orleans of the north and luring thousands of fans to North
America's biggest jazz bash.
   A slew of streets have been shut down for the ninth Montreal
International Jazz Festival, a 10-day blowout expected to attract a
record 600,000 people by the time a Louisiana bayou blues band lays
down the final riffs early Monday.
   With a roster ranging from Miles Davis to Manhattan Transfer,
the festival, which began last Friday, has transformed the town
into a musical mecca.
   Under the cast-iron balconies of gabled houses on Rue St-Denis,
buskers, acrobats and bongo players entertain between bandstands
and the snap of bebop trumpets emerges from crowded cafes.
   A few blocks away, 60,000 listeners packed Place des Arts
earlier this week to hear white South African singer Johnny Clegg
and his integrated band Savuka deliver their soulful anti-apartheid
message.
   Organizers of the non-profit $3.5 million festival also staged a
Cuban night featuring keyboard prodigy Gonzalo Rubalcaba; the
Canadian debut of Mamma Tongue, a Gambian-American band mixing
Africa oral tradition with jazz; and an inspired double bill of
pianist Dorothy Donegan and alto sax star Phil Woods that caused a
happy riot.
   After many encores, an exhausted Donegan quipped: ``Did I get
the job?''
   Guitarist Pat Metheny, a guest at eight of the nine Montreal
gatherings, was dubbed the festival's patron saint and appointed
judge of a Canadian jazz band contest.
   ``It's the best fest going,'' Metheny told a news conference.
``I don't think there's anything that can compare. It's such a
great town and a great setting, especially with the whole
environment of closing off the streets.''
   George Wein, who once ran the Newport Jazz Festival, has called
Montreal the most complete and best-organized jazz festival in the
world _ aided by $415,000 in government grants.
   With its gallic atmosphere and European sophistication, Montreal
has always been hip to jazz _ it's the hometown of Oscar Peterson.
   A recent influx of Third World immigrants has rejuvenated and
broadened the tradition.
   ``Within the heart of the city you have French, English, Cubans,
Puerto Ricans, Irish _ it's so culturally varied,'' said strolling
musician Jeremy Dunlop who arrived from Jamaica 13 years ago and is
sitting in on the deep-barrelled African djembe drum whenever a
band offers an invitation.
   Miles Davis contributed not only the festival's opening night
highlight on Friday, he drew a self-portrait in pastels that became
the official poster and made its way onto stage backdrops and
T-shirts.
   Although afficionados paid up to $24.50 to hear Davis, Dizzy
Gillespie, Ornette Coleman and Robert Cray, the heart of the
festival is the 250 free concerts in the open air, plus five
marching bands.
   Festival president Alain Simard defends his decision to invite
reggae star Jimmy Cliff, blues singer Etta James, Senegalese
sensation Youssou N'Dour and other acts outside the realms of
traditional jazz.
   ``We don't have a dogmatic vision of jazz. It's not something to
put in a museum. Lately, jazz has been very influenced by Latin and
African music,'' Simard said in an interview.
   He said musicians tell each other about Montreal and it's never
any problem booking acts. ``In nine years we've not had a
cancellation.
   ``People feel secure here, even at late hours out in the
streets. It probably couldn't happen in New York.''

   Quick. Think back to the Moscow summit. It was
only a few weeks ago.
   What did it produce?
   An end to the nuclear arms race? A Middle East agreement?
Superpower cooperation to end the Iran-Iraq war?
   None of the above.
   President Reagan, who now leads all U.S. chief executives in
superpower summits with four of them, gave his enthusiastic support
to Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign to restructure the Soviet economy.
   That was significant, and very dramatic.
   Here was the American president, a pronounced critic of
communism, in Moscow endorsing Gorbachev's perestroika program _
and blaming the bureaucracy, not the Kremlin, for violations of
human rights.
   But the agreements reached in Moscow were on the level of
fishing and maritime pacts _ not the sort of accords that require
the immense political power of the U.S. president and the Soviet
general secretary.
   Charles M. Fairbanks Jr., a scholar at the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies, has concluded that summits
frequently fail to make effective use of the considerable authority
of national leaders.
   In a recent study, and an interview, Fairbanks said summits
frequently become occasions of drama rather than instruments of
coordinated diplomacy.
   The Moscow summit, he said, ``produced essentially nothing in
diplomatic terms. The most important thing, I think, that took
place was Reagan speaking to a Soviet audience. That probably
served a useful function. But it's certainly not the function a
summit is held out to serve.''
   Summits have come to be understood as occasions for personal
negotiations between immensely powerful political leaders. At
Reykjavik, in 1986, for instance, Gorbachev presented Reagan with a
series of historic arms control proposals.
   These included the abolition of ballistic missiles and,
possibly, all nuclear weapons.
   Normally, diplomats at lower levels work for years to reach the
point where such cosmic decisions can be made at the summit.
   ``The advantages of traditional diplomacy are that it is calm,
quiet and usually secret,'' Fairbanks writes. ``Summit conferences,
however, are very dramatic.''
   Gorbachev used the Reykjavik summit to symbolize his dedication
to arms control. It also produced pressure for concessions from
Reagan, but they were later withdrawn. The idea of banning
ballistic missiles was quickly and quietly buried only a few months
later.
   In the end, Reykjavik did not produce anything substantial.
   Because summits are so dramatic, they create a desperate need
for success. And this, Fairbanks said, gives birth to a tremendous
temptation to proclaim fictitious results.
   Reporters get sucked in. Trivia is exalted. But sometimes all
that really happened is that the two most powerful leaders in the
world met.
   Time magazine seemed to realize this in its account of the 1967
summit meeting between President Lyndon Johnson and Soviet Premier
Alexei Kosygin in Glasboro, N.J., in 1967.
   ``In the aftermath of history's first hot-line diplomacy,'' Time
reported, ``the most significant aspect of the Smalltown summit was
that it happened.''
   Then there are the summits which really produce results.
   President Jimmy Carter invited Prime Minister Menachem Begin of
Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt to Camp David in 1978 and
overcame differences between the two Middle East leaders since
their own summit meeting a year earlier.
   The result was the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
   Reaching back into history, Fairbanks recalls the long-forgotten
summit held between Wilhelm II of Germany and Nikolai II of Russia
at B'yorkyo in July 1905.
   In terms of immediate results, he writes, ``this was perhaps the
most successful summit in history.''
   Germany signed an alliance with Russia that might have changed
the course of history.
   But even that treaty was quickly canceled.
   Nikolai's foreign minister explained to the czar that it
undercut Russia's longstanding alliance with France and had to be
discarded.
   Nine years later, Russia went to war with Germany as an ally of
France. The war devastated Russia and paved the way for the
Bolshevik revolution.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Votes To Impeach Federal Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings says his
fight to remain on the federal bench is ``far from being over''
even though a House subcommittee unanimously recommended that he be
impeached.
   Hastings, Florida's first black federal judge, said from Miami
he is ``legally, morally and spiritually correct'' and the
subcommittee's 7-0 decision Thursday shows members ``do not respect
the jury system.''
   A federal jury acquitted Hastings five years ago of the bribery
charges that account for part of the criminal justice subcommittee
resolution containing 17 articles of impeachment.
   The resolution charged that Hastings conspired with a Washington
lawyer to seek a bribe from two convicted racketeers, lied during
his trial about his action and leaked information from an FBI
wiretap over which he had jurisdiction.
   The subcommittee found that Hastings committed ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' and should be impeached. The House Judiciary
Committee will decide next Thursday whether to send the resolution
to the House floor.
   If the full House impeaches Hastings, the Senate would conduct a
trial to determine whether he should be removed from office.
   Hastings' attorney, Terence J. Anderson, said he was surprised
by the unanimous vote. ``I thought there might be only five votes
against him,'' he said. ``I take it in good faith that they believe
it was an impeachable offense.''
   ``It's now time to prepare for a trial in the Senate,'' said
Anderson, echoing the thoughts of others that the unanimous vote
almost assures that the resolution will be approved by the full
committee and the House.
   Hastings said he would not step down from the bench voluntarily.
   ``It ain't over,'' Hastings said. ``It's far from being over.''
   Anderson said Hastings ``hasn't fought this battle for seven
years for a $90,000-a-year job.''
   ``It's the principle of it,'' he said.
   Anderson said, however, that Hastings may recuse himself from
cases if there is a trial in the Senate.
   ``You can't be trying cases and be running back and forth
between Washington and Miami to hear them,'' he said
   Hastings, who calls the charges politically motivated and has
insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing, refused to testify
on his own behalf during the subcommittee's hearings, an action
more than one member commented on. Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., the
ranking Republican member, said his refusal to testify hurt him and
made for a weak defense.
   ``He didn't testify on principle,'' said Anderson. ``He
testified before a jury of his peers, under oath, and those
transcripts were available if they wanted to read them. He didn't
have to testify here.''
   In February 1983, Hastings was acquitted of charges he conspired
with Washington lawyer William Borders to receive a bribe in
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers.
Borders was convicted in a separate trial, was sent to prison and
has now been released.
   A month after Hastings' acquittal, U.S. District Judges W.
Terrell Hodges of Florida and Anthony A. Alaimo of Georgia filed a
complaint under the 1980 discipline law asking the 11th U.S.
Circuit of Appeals, which includes Florida, to investigate
Hastings. After a lengthy inquiry, made longer by Hastings'
challenge to the law's constitutionality, a five-member panel of
the 11th Circuit recommended that the House begin the impeachment
inquiry.
   Two years ago, U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada
became the first federal judge in 50 years to be impeached. Unlike
Hastings, Claiborne was convicted of a crime, tax evasion, and was
brought to the Senate for his trial from a federal penitentiary.
   Another House judiciary subcommittee is holding hearings on an
impeachment resolution against U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon
Jr., of Mississippi, who was convicted of perjury and is serving a
prison sentence. Impeachment charges were brought against Claiborne
and Nixon when they refused to resign from the bench after their
convictions.

   So fierce is the Navy's Aegis system, the 6
million-part, $1 billion weaponry used to down an Iranian jetliner,
that crewmen on the first Aegis ship coined the motto, ``If it
flies, it dies.''
   But some looking at Sunday's tragedy in the Persian Gulf say
unleashing the Aegis cruiser Vincennes in the tiny, crowded waters
was the equivalent of letting a pit bull protect a playpen.
   Analysts speculating on the attack conclude the cruiser's
defense system did exactly what it was supposed to: track and
destroy an apparent threat, suspected at the time to be an Iranian
F-14 fighter.
   But questions remain, like why Aegis' super-sophisticated
technology could not separate civilian from military air traffic,
or distinguish a 63-foot-long fighter from a 176-foot airliner.
   The Navy and the key Aegis contractor _ RCA Corp. of Moorestown,
N.J. _ have given only limited answers. But experts and extensive
defense literature offer some suggestions.
   The Vincennes, only the third ship to carry the technology,
relied on Aegis to discover and track an unidentified aircraft
approaching during hostilities between U.S. and Iranian forces.
   Aegis experts note that while radar consoles likely showed the
plane as hostile, it was Vincennes Capt. Will Rogers III _ not the
emotionless Aegis computers _ who gave the order to fire.
   One of two Aegis-guided SM-2 Standard missiles found its mark,
later determined to be an unarmed Airbus with 290 people aboard.
   Dr. Thomas Amlie, a former director of the Naval Weapons Center
in China Lake, Calif., said the system appears to have done
``exactly what it was supposed to do.''
   ``It worked perfectly ... unfortunately,'' said Amlie, now
employed by the Air Force.
   Aegis ships carry a complex mixture of radar, computers and
weapons to cast a protective net over a Navy task force. When the
net is penetrated, Aegis evaluates the intruder, and declares it
friend or foe.
   The system, first deployed in 1983, is said to be able to sort
out more than 200 targets from as far out as 250 miles.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, on Thursday questioned whether such a powerful system
should be deployed in the narrow gulf.
   ``The Aegis cruiser is essentially a blue-water ship that was
operating in a brown-water lake,'' said Nunn.
   But a Capitol Hill expert insisted Aegis is the world's best
naval system for fighting in close quarters. ``It gives the
commander more time to make a ponderous decision,'' said the
researcher, who asked to stay anonymous.
   The Vincennes' crew ``had about four minutes from the time they
picked up this target until it was declared hostile,'' Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday.
   Pentagon officials say Rogers concluded the Airbus was an enemy
based on its flight path, its failure to identify itself, and its
confusing broadcast of both civilian and military frequencies.
   The information was processed electronically into the Vincennes'
Combat Information Center, its nerve center. The windowless chamber
glows with the light of four, 42-inch-square ``battle picture''
screens and other consoles.
   They depict aircraft not as traditional radar blips, but as
graphic symbols _ white on a blue background, roughly like a
complex video game.
   While Navy officials have declined this week to let reporters
view such a display, one expert says Aegis designates planes by
showing circles around friends, diamonds around foes and squares
around unknowns.
   Like all Navy anti-aircraft systems, Aegis cannot definitively
distinguish one type of plane from another, especially when flying
head on.
   The system relies on friendly aircraft to emit, or ``squawk,''
their identities. Aegis sees all unidentified airplanes as
potential foes.
   Humans, using the system as a tool, must make the ultimate
decision.
   ``It's not designed to classify targets,'' the congressional
staffer said. ``It's just designed to detect and track them.''
   Ironically, he said, an experienced radar operator using a less
sophisticated system might have been able to tell an Airbus from a
fighter by comparing the size of blips.
   In theory, the Vincennes' control-room screens could show
civilian routes and even expected flights, experts say.
   The USS Ticonderoga, the first Aegis cruiser, acted as a ``de
facto'' control tower off Lebanon in 1983, according to its
combat-systems officer.
   The Ticonderoga's systems ``routinely'' sorted out traffic in
the potentially hostile skies, Cmdr. James McClure wrote in a
glowing 1985 review of Aegis for ``Proceedings.''
   However, during that mission, the Ticonderoga's computers
reportedly failed to see a small, incoming plane visible to the
naked eye. In 1986 hostilities off Libya, the Aegis cruiser
Yorktown targeted and shot what some analysts say was a dense cloud
on the water's surface.
   Even Crowe acknowledges Aegis has limitations. ``It has not
solved all of our problems and it does not defy the laws of
physics,'' he said.

   A Boston banker nominated to the Federal
Reserve Board is denying accusations that he attempted to dodge
taxes in a $2.5-million ``golden parachute'' compensation package
with the bank he heads.
   ``The tax is being paid, regardless,'' and the federal
government is losing no money, John P. LaWare told the Senate
Banking Committee. ``I'm not sure it's a dodge.''
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the committee, saw it
differently. He noted that the $500,000-a-year deal requires the
bank _ not LaWare _ to pay a 20 percent penalty that Congress
imposed on portions of such arrangements that are considered
excessive.
   ``How do you justify such an attempt to dodge the tax code?''
Proxmire asked. He noted that Congress enacted the special penalty
in 1984 ``to discourage excessive payments which officers and
directors vote themselves'' when corporations change ownership or
control.
   LaWare repeated, ``I'm not sure a tax dodge is involved.''
   LaWare was given the special compensation package earlier this
year, just after turning 60, as part of a merger agreement that
created Shawmut National Corp. of Boston and Hartford, a bank
holding company. A banker for 35 years, he has been chairman and
chief executive officer of another Shawmut holding company since
1980.
   Under the agreement, the corporation will continue LaWare's
annual salary of about $500,000 until he is 65, even if he leaves
the bank. In addition, the bank will give him enough extra to cover
the 20 percent penalty. LaWare must pay income tax on the full
package.
   Proxmire estimated that having the bank pay the penalty was
worth $200,000 to LaWare.
   LaWare has agreed to sever all financial connections with the
bank before taking the Federal Reserve seat.
   Despite Proxmire's concerns about the financial deal, the
chairman and most other members who attended the hearing praised
LaWare. ``The president has made an excellent choice,'' said Sen.
Jake Garn, R-Utah.
   Nevertheless, there is no assurance LaWare, a Democrat, will
take a seat on the board, which controls the nation's money supply
and, thus, interest rates. That is because his confirmation would
mean that President Reagan would have filled all seven seats on the
board.
   Committee aides say some Democrats have expressed a reluctance
to seat another Reagan nominee this year, preferring to leave a
vacancy for the next president, who they hope will be Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Proxmire told reporters he will confer with committee members
before deciding whether the panel should vote on the LaWare
nomination this year. Should the committee recommend the
nomination, it would be up to Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd to
determine whether the Senate considers the nomination this year.
   LaWare's term would expire Jan. 31, 2002.
   The issue of monetary policy was barely mentioned at the
hearing. Most questions were about the federal budget and trade
deficits, the increasing share of U.S. debt held by foreign
investors and Third World debt.
   LaWare said he is little concerned about the fact that only one
of the world's 10 biggest banks is American.
   ``I don't think that makes much difference,'' he said. ``It's
how well-managed and profitable they are. ... I am more concerned
with the profit-and-loss statement'' than with size.

<HEAD>Congress Ducks Decision on Closing Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has sidestepped a final decision on
one of the touchiest parochial issues faced by the 535 legislators
_ closing military installations the Pentagon says are no longer
needed.
   The House debated the issue for four hours Thursday and could
agree only that it should put off any final decision.
   ``This is not something people around here like to deal with
very much,'' admitted Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.
   While the House inconclusively debated, House and Senate
negotiators agreed on a Pentagon budget bill that dropped any
mention of closing bases, an issue on which the negotiators had
been trying to reach agreement. The final decision was to drop any
mention of base closings from the bill.
   Bases mean jobs, something legislators fight hard to protect,
several House members noted during Thursday's debate.
   ``It has been historically unthinkable and unworkable for the
Department of Defense to close bases because of congressional
opposition,'' said Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking
Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
   In fact, congressional opposition has prevented any base
closings since 1977. But in the 16 years before then, the Pentagon
shut down 3,600 installations.
   There are about 3,800 military installations around the nation
and another 1,900 overseas, according to Aspin, who said the figure
covers facilities ranging from recruiting stations to the largest
bases.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has appointed a nine-member
commission to review which of the military installations can be
shut down. That panel is meeting now, and Pentagon officials have
said that between $2 billion and $5 billion annually could
eventually be saved.
   The commission is scheduled to make its recommendations by Dec.
31 and President Reagan would then have two weeks, or shortly
before he leaves office, to either accept or reject the entire list.
   The House is considering two separate bills that would implement
the commission's decisions.
   One, sponsored by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, provides that the
commission's recommendations would take effect unless both the
House and Senate vote to reject them.
   The second, backed by a trio of House committees, provided that
the recommendations only take effect if both chambers vote in favor
of them. But the House voted 250-138 approval Thursday of an
amendment to the committee-backed bill, a change that provides the
closures will go ahead unless both chambers vote to block them.
   That modified the bill to make it similar to the Armey plan and
provided a test of sentiment, according to Aspin.
   Then the chamber adjourned, following its normal pattern of not
doing business after Thursday afternoon, which allows west coast
members to return home for a weekend of re-election campaigning.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla, said closing bases ``is certainly one
of the toughest political issues we face.''
   Until 1975, Congress had placed few obstacles in the way of
Pentagon base closure plans. But when the Air Force proposed
shutting down Loring Air Force Base in northern Maine that year,
Congress blocked the procedure. One requirement ordered lengthy _
and costly _ environmental impact studies for the Loring closing
and all future closings.
   House approval of the base-closing bill would send it directly
to a conference committee with the Senate, which approved its own
plan two months ago. The package was dropped out of the Pentagon
budget bill in order to give the House time to decide what it
wanted to do, according to Senate leaders.

   As the Pentagon pieces together more
information about what happened in the haze over the Persian Gulf
on Sunday, it has been revising its explanations of the shooting
down of an Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship.
   Starting with what type of plane was shot down _ the Pentagon
originally said it was an F-14 jet fighter, not a commercial
airliner _ the Pentagon has gone on to revise its account of
whether it was in the commercial air corridor, at what altitude it
was flying and what sort of signals it was transmitting.
   ``We all of us probably know a lot more about that situation now
than the captain of the ship did,'' Defense Department spokesman
Dan Howard told reporters Thursday at an 80-minute briefing devoted
almost entirely to the shooting.
   Still, he said, much remains unknown and the full, official U.S.
explanation will have to await the report of a Navy investigating
team, now in the gulf area, that is expected to complete its report
in two or three weeks.
   From the beginning, the affair has been marked by confusion as
officials and reporters groped for information in the highly
technical world of air-and-sea battle in the 1980s.

<BYLINE>WHAT TYPE OF PLANE WAS IT?</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's first announcement, issued within hours after the
2:51 a.m. EDT incident Sunday, said the plane shot down by the
cruiser Vincennes was an Iranian F-14 ``approaching in a hostile
manner.''
   At 1:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, however, Adm. William Crowe, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared at a hastily called news
briefing and confirmed Iranian reports that the plane was in fact a
civilian airliner.
   Pentagon sources said U.S. military leaders changed their mind
after an analysis of intelligence data showed an A300 Airbus had
been found in the waters of the gulf and no Iranians warplanes were
flying in the area at the time.
   One source said the intelligence collected after the incident
included radio signals from airplanes and ground stations as well
as a limited and not always reliable network of informers on the
ground.
   In his Sunday briefing, Crowe stressed that the information he
was giving was ``based on the information currently available'' and
was subject to correction later.

   ``The suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air
corridor,'' Crowe said, in a statement that became a subject of
dispute in the ensuing days.
   On Wednesday, according to congressional sources, Navy briefers
told House and Senate members that the airliner was inside the
20-mile wide corridor assigned to commercial airliners flying
between the Bandar Abbas airfield and Dubai.
   Howard said Thursday the aircraft was about 4{ miles ``outside
the normal flight path,'' which he said veteran air traffic
controllers had told him was the center line of the corridor.
   The width of such commercial air corridors varies. Although they
are 20 miles wide in Iran, they are eight miles wide in the United
States and there have been suggestions to make them narrower,
Howard said.

<TEXT>
   In another statement that has been called into question, Crowe
said Sunday that the airplane was ``decreasing in altitude as it
neared the ship.'' He said that it was at 7,800 to 9,000 feet when
it was hit.
   Data from the frigate USS John H. Sides, which was in the same
area, indicated that the plane was at 12,600 feet and either steady
or ascending.
   Howard said Thursday that the altitude reported for the plane by
air traffic controllers at Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was similar
to that given by Crowe and that if the altitude were as different
as reported by the Sides, the missile would not have hit the
airplane.
   He conceded, however, that authorities do not know whether the
missile scored a direct hit or merely exploded somewhere within
lethal range of the aircraft.
   Crowe also said Sunday that the aircraft ``neither answered nor
changed its course'' after being given warnings by the Vincennes on
both military and civilian frequencies.

<TEXT>
   At his briefings Tuesday and Thursday, Howard said the Vincennes
received signals from the airplane in modes common to civilian,
commercial and military aircraft and could not tell from the signal
whether the plane was civilian or military.
   Both times, Howard said this was not inconsistent with the
version given by Crowe, who said there were ``electronic
indications on (the) Vincennes that led it to believe the aircraft
was an F-14.''
   After the congressional briefing Wednesday, Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
signals received by the Vincennes were identical to those emitted
earlier by Iranian F-14s from Bandar Abbas, leading to speculation
that they did not come from the airliner.
   Howard, however, said that such speculation was based on a
discussion of remote possibilities and that almost certainly
``there is no phantom aircraft there.''

<HEAD>Reagan Expected To OK Energy, Water Development Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is expected to sign a $17.8
billion package for energy and water development programs _ a bill
whose timely passage made it something of a legislative oddity.
   The measure, sent to the White House on Thursday following 91-3
approval by the Senate, is the first regular appropriations bill
for the coming fiscal year to clear Congress.
   For the past two years, lawmakers have rolled the 13 regular
bills into huge omnibus packages called continuing resolutions.
   If the energy and water legislation is signed by Reagan, it
would be the first regular spending bill to get a presidential
signature since December 1985.
   The bill is expected to get his approval. It is one of the few
fiscal 1989 appropriations bills wending their way through Congress
that has not drawn a veto threat.
   The legislation is a hold-the-line plan containing few new
initiatives and, lawmakers say, not one dime to allow the Army
Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation to begin building any
new dams, harbor and irrigation projects next year.
   Another casualty is the superconducting super collider, which
was refused the $350 million the administration sought to begin its
construction. Instead, Congress voted $100 million for more
preliminary planning for the high-energy physics research project.
   Leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees said
the next president should make the decision on whether to commit
the nation to building the multibillion-dollar project.
   The legislation would give the corps $11 million less in fiscal
1989, which begins next Oct. 1, than it is now getting. The bureau
would get $40 million more. Both agencies would have money to
continue work on more than 200 existing construction projects, but
at a slower pace in a number of cases.
   The Energy Department would get about two-thirds of the $17.83
billion, with $8.1 billion earmarked for the nuclear activities it
conducts on behalf of the Department of Defense.
   There is $3 million in the bill to bolster federal research into
the ``greenhouse effect,'' which some scientists say is a dangerous
global warming trend caused by mankind's overloading the atmosphere
with gases like carbon and fluorocarbons.

<HEAD>S&L Regulators Double Texas Bailout Estimates</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are seeing red at federal
regulators' newest projections more than doubling the bill the
government will be left with as it tries to bail out Texas'
faltering savings and loan industry.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
raised the ante on the bailouts Thursday, telling the House Banking
Committee that the estimated cost of dealing with the problems of
Texas thrifts would be $15.2 billion. Previously, regulators had
said the bill would be $7 billion.
   ``Now you see it, now you don't,'' said a frustrated Rep.
Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the banking panel.
``Watch the bouncing ball.''
   ``It's called garbage in and garbage out,'' said Rep. Stan
Parris, R-Va. ``The definition of rosy scenario is changing so fast
I can't even keep up with it.''
   Wall said his agency's estimate of bailout costs in Texas had
increased because thrifts' losses, and the costs of resolving their
problems, have been more expensive than expected. St Germain,
however, said there were other factors as well.
   ``Some of the problems are just plain old-fashioned
mismanagement, insider dealing, fraud and high-flying excesses,
exacerbated by lax supervision and hesitant enforcement,'' he said.
   Many lawmakers have long been jousting with bank board
officials, accusing them of using optimistic economic scenarios to
justify rosy cost projections.
   Wall did not reveal a new projection for what it would cost to
bail out all of the country's savings and loans facing financial
problems. But he said, ``We see that the resources ... can be and
would be sufficient for the size of the problem as we see it.''
   Wall also told the lawmakers that his agency would be able to
raise $42.5 billion over the next decade to cover insolvencies
across the country.
   The government had previously estimated that the cost of
bailouts nationally would be in the $25 billion to $30 billion
range and that the bank board would have $30.2 billion at its
disposal to merge, sell or liquidate troubled thrifts.
   Wall said that to pay for the newly estimated costs of the Texas
bailouts, his agency will raise an additional $12.3 billion, mostly
by extending the special assessment the thrifts now pay on their
deposits.
   Of the country's 3,100 thrifts, the bank board has a caseload of
259 that will need financial assistance from the government and has
identified 252 others likely to need financial help.
   About 60 percent of the troubled thrifts are in the Southwest.
Half of those are in Texas alone, where the economy has faltered in
recent years because of falling oil prices. Until now, the
government had estimated it would cost $7 billion to deal with the
Texas savings and loans.
   The country's savings and loans hold $950 billion in deposits in
100 million accounts.
   The nation's thrifts lost $7.6 billion last year, making it the
industry's worst year since the Depression. In the first three
months of this year, 133 insolvent savings and loans in Texas have
lost $3.4 billion.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the federal
program that insures thrifts, spent $3.7 billion last year to
handle the insolvencies of 47 savings and loans.
   Due to the increasing strains from growing numbers of bailouts,
the FSLIC saw its reserve rop from $6.8 billion in 1983 to $600
million last year. Congress provided $10.8 billion more for the
program last August.

<HEAD>Raider T. Boone Pickens Hails SEC Vote On One-Share, One-Vote Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new regulation limiting U.S. companies'
ability to weaken the voting power of stockholders as a hostile
takeover defense is being hailed by a prominent raider as a victory
for corporate democracy.
   After nearly two years of periodic hearings and debate, the
Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-1 on Thursday to approve
a one-share, one-vote rule. Under it, actions that dilute the power
of existing shareholders are generally barred.
   ``The SEC's action helps to restore democracy to corporate
America,'' said Texas oilman and takeover specialist T. Boone
Pickens Jr., chairman of the United Shareholders Association.
   ``The rule is not perfect and there are loopholes, but all
things considered shareholders won a great victory,'' Pickens said.
   In unrelated action, the commission backed off from recommending
legislation that would guarantee investors the right to sue their
stockbroker in court.
   The commission had been considering asking Congress to outlaw
clauses in brokerage account agreements that require customers to
settle disputes through industry-sponsored arbitration panels,
rather than through the courts.
   But, by a 5-0 vote, the commission decided instead to ask stock
exchanges and other organizations that run arbitration systems to
study the matter and report back by Oct. 15.
   The one-share, one-vote rule takes effect immediately and
companies will have to comply if they want their stock traded on an
exchange or through the National Association of Securities Dealers'
automated quotation system. The 359 U.S. companies that already
have unequal voting rights will be exempted.
   One popular takeover defense, in which companies entice
stockholders into giving up their voting rights by offering a
special one-time dividend, would be prohibited.
   Also barred would be rules that require a stock purchaser to
wait, sometimes for several years, before newly acquired shares
accrue full voting rights.
   However, in another voting rights area, the SEC decided to defer
to the states. If state law permits, companies will be allowed to
deny voting power to takeover raiders unless the other shareholders
approve. About a dozen states have adopted such laws.
   Richard G. Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of market
regulation, said he doubted the new rule would have a dramatic
effect on takeovers. But he conceded that in a few cases takeovers
would be easier because the rule eliminates some ``extremely
effective'' defenses.
   Commissioner Charles C. Cox, the only member to vote against the
rule, said he believed the SEC was intruding into an area that has
traditionally been left to states: chartering and governance of
corporations.
   ``I believe this is an improper use of the listing standards to
tamper with corporate governance,'' he said.
   However, Commission Chairman David S. Ruder said the rule is
structured to be as least intrusive as possible.
   Companies will still be permitted to issue new shares with
diluted voting power. Diluted-power shares can also be issued to
accomplish a merger. And private companies going public will be
able to issue both strong-voting and weak-voting shares.
   Stocks of foreign companies traded in the United States will be
exempted from the regulations, as will the stocks of small
companies listed in the NASD's so-called ``pink sheets'' and traded
by brokers over the telephone.
   On the arbitration issue, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the
securities markets, sharply criticized the SEC for giving in to
industry lobbying and said he would press forward with legislation.
   ``I think the industry stared into the SEC's eyes on this issue
and the SEC blinked,'' he said.
   When the commission discussed arbitration clauses last month,
the legislative recommendation looked headed for approval. It was
supported by Ruder and SEC member Aulana L. Peters. Cox said he was
inclined to favor it but wanted to hear from securities firms,
which strongly opposed banning the clauses.
   But, on Thursday, Ruder retreated from his earlier support for
an immediate vote, saying it was encouraging that the industry
would at least favor disclosure notices to customers explaining the
meaning of the clauses. And, he said many firms have put a hold on
plans to require arbitration agreements for cash accounts.
   However, James C. Meyer, president of the North American
Securities Administrators Association, which represents state
regulators, said, ``Small investors will see the commission failure
to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against them.''

<HEAD>Senate Cuts Maverick Missiles From F-18 Fighters For Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's bid to sell Kuwait
40 advanced F-18 fighters is running into strong congressional
opposition as the Senate votes to strip a potent missile from the
warplane's weapons inventory.
   The Senate action to remove the air-to-ground Maverick missile
from the $1.9 billion arms package came only hours after the
administration formally asked Congress to approve the sale to give
oil-rich Kuwait a ``first line of defense'' in a region racked by
the war between Iran and Iraq.
   Before the measure was adopted on a voice vote, senators made
clear they believe the Maverick would pose a security threat to
Israel if it should fall into the hands of the Arab enemies of the
Jewish state.
   Earlier Thursday, before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee,
administration officials said the Maverick was an essential part of
the F-18's defensive systems and part of an arms package so
structured as to pose no threat to Israel.
   But critics said the sale would fuel an escalating arms race in
the volatile Persian Gulf.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., at first attempted to bar the
sale of Mavericks to any nation in the Persian Gulf region, then
modified his proposal to apply to Kuwait only.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that if he had his way he would
condition the sale of the Maverick and other ``state-of-the-art''
weapons to Middle East nations only if they ``renounce the use of
force and recognize the right of Israel to exist.''
   Congress has 30 days to block the F-18 sale. Otherwise it goes
ahead.
   Although there is wide opposition in Congress to selling
sensitive high technology weapons to Middle East nations it was not
clear whether a ban on transferring Mavericks to Kuwait will
eventually become law.
   Testifying before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, Peter
Burleigh, assistant deputy secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, described the Maverick as an essential element in a purely
defensive package.
   Burleigh said the deal is in the interests of the United States
which is using naval forces to protect the ships of Kuwait and
other nations sailing through the Persian Gulf.
   ``Friendly states should be their own first line of defense, so
we don't have to be,'' Burleigh said.
   ``By helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibility
for its own defense, it complements our highly successful escort
operations,'' he said.
   Burleigh also testified that a group of U.S. allies will soon
announce a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia, another major oil
producing Arab state on the Persian Gulf.
   One subcommittee member, Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., described the
pending sale to Saudi Arabia as ``enormous,'' running into the
``tens of billions of dollars.''
   Burleigh said he was not able to disclose which countries are
involved in the deal, the nature of the weapons to be sold or their
total value.
   The Reagan administration seeks to sell Kuwait not only the 40
F-18s but their armaments as well. Other than the Maverick, the
weapons include Sidewinder, Sparrow and Harpoon missiles and
cluster bombs.
   The missiles are among the most advanced air-to-air and
air-to-surface weapons in the U.S. inventory.
   But Burleigh said only limited quantities of the missiles are
being provided, ``far less than would be necessary for an offensive
purpose.''
   Under the terms of the agreement with Kuwait, the first of the
aircraft would be delivered in 1991 and the remainder over the next
three years.
   Responding to critical questioning, Burleigh said F-18s in
Kuwait will not have the range required to strike at targets in
Israel and that Kuwait will not be sold the tanker aircraft needed
to increase that range.

<TEXT>
   Complaints by passengers about the nation's
airlines are continuing their decline, falling slightly last month
from May and dramatically from June 1987, the Transportation
Department says.
   Monthly statistics released Thursday show that the department
received 1,707 complaints about the airlines last month, down from
1,820 in May. The June figure was also 70 percent lower than the
number of complaints logged during the same month a year earlier,
when 5,774 gripes were registered.
   Statistics for the nation's 13 biggest airlines also showed that
80.5 percent of their flights into the 27 busiest airports landed
on time, which means they landed within 15 minutes of their
scheduled arrival.
   Flights destined for Salt Lake City landed on time 91.9 percent
of the time, the best percentage reported. Minneapolis, with an
86.5 percent on-time rate, rated seventh best and was the highest
ranked city not in the South or West.
   By contrast, the airports with the seven-lowest arrival rates
were all from the Northeast: Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston,
Newark, N.J., both New York City airports, and Washington National
Airport.
   The department does not count flights that were late for
mechanical reasons.
   The statistics also showed that the airlines with the two
highest on-time performances in May were carriers primarily serving
the West and South: Southwest, with an on-time rate of 92.5, and
America West, whose flights arrived as scheduled 90.9 percent of
the time.
   Pan American had the highest percentage of individual flights
that were chronically late _ that is, were late at least 70 percent
of the time during May _ at 6.3 percent. USAir was second, with 2.5
of that carrier's flights being late 70 percent of the time that
month.
   TWA had the highest number of complaints per 1,000 passengers
about lost and damaged baggage in May at 9.54. Southwest Airlines
reported 3.23 complaints per 1,000 passengers, the lowest rate. All
the airlines reporting said they had received 6.16 complaints per
1,000 passengers about mishandled baggage, down from the average of
6.53 in April.
   Two carriers owned by Texas Air Corp. had the highest rates of
complaint. Continental Airlines reported receiving 11.11 complaints
per 100,000 passengers last month. Eastern Airlines said it got
9.16 complaints per 100,000 customers.

   A North Carolina prison escapee wanted in
a Florida murder spree was captured late Thursday after eluding
more than 50 searchers through woods, car lots and a lake bank for
two hours.
   Officers said they captured Thomas Anthony Wyatt, 24, of North
Wilkesboro, N.C., about 10:15 p.m. at a car lot on S.C. 200, the
same road on which he was pulled over in a traffic stop two hours
earlier.
   He escaped May 13 in his green prison work garb from the Wilkes
County Prison Unit, where he was being held for questioning in
connection with the Florida murders of three Domino's Pizza workers
and a Tampa woman May 17.
   Wyatt's partner in the escape, Michael Gene Lovette, 29, of
Statesville may still be at large, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer
reported. Charlotte is the major city between Lancaster County, in
north-central South Carolina, and Wilkes County, several hours'
drive north in the western North Carolina mountains.
   An unidentified man who was with Wyatt in the pickup truck
pulled over by Highway Patrol Trooper E.S. Robinson Thursday
evening was being held in the Lancaster County Jail after he gave a
false name, officers said.
   Robinson held the unidentified man after Wyatt fled while the
trooper checked the truck's tag number, verifying it was stolen.
   More than 50 Lancaster sheriff's officers, FBI and state agents
and their bloodhounds traced Wyatt's steps through woods, around
homes and a series of car lots.
   Intermittently, residents reported a man in gray sweat pants in
the area, asking for a ride and roaming in a used-car lot. When
officers captured Wyatt, he was wearing gray jogging pants.

   Through thick and thin, the biggest buyers of
farmland are other farmers, says an Agriculture Department report.
   According to the department's Economic Research Service, farm
owner-operators accounted for 56 percent of all reported purchases,
64 percent of all acreage sold, and 54 percent of the total sales
value.
   The agency said its Farmland Market Survey included real estate
brokers and appraisers, commercial bankers, federal lending
institutions, farmers and ranchers.
   Participants in the 1988 survey reported details on nearly 7,150
sales involving nearly 2.3 million acres sold between Sept. 1,
1987, and Feb. 1, 1988. Results were included in a recent general
report on farmland values.
   ``The 1988 percentages are comparable with those in preceding
years,'' the report said. ``Owner-operators were particularly
prevalent buyers in the Mountain (70 percent), Northern Plains (67
percent), and Pacific (62 percent) regions.''
   Non-farmers constituted 30 percent of all farmland buyers, and
were especially active in the Southeast, making up 51 percent of
the region's purchasers; Appalachia, 42 percent; and the Northeast,
39 percent.
   The survey also showed that fewer farm sales are being financed,
a trend that has persisted in the 1980s. In the most recent
tabulation, about 70 percent of the land sales were financed, down
from 73 percent in 1987 and from 91 percent in 1980.
   ``The percentage financed in 1988 is comparable with mid-1960s
levels,'' the report said. ``Cash sales are occurring more
frequently, particularly in the Corn Belt. Over 90 percent of the
Corn Belt sales in the late 1970s and early 1980s involved
financing, compared with only 67 percent in 1988.''
   Another survey item showed that in the case of financing, the
amount of debt as a percentage of the purchase price averaged 72
percent in 1988, down from 77 percent a year earlier.
   ``This represents the first significant drop in several years
and brings the share financed in line with that in the mid-1960s,''
the report said. ``Percentages were lower in nearly all regions in
1987-88, especially in the Northeast, Southeast and Pacific
regions. Debt percentages remain highest in the Delta states and
Southern Plains, averaging around 80 percent.''
   The general report, Agricultural Resources, was an expanded
version of the agency's report on farmland values, which was issued
on April 14. It showed that U.S. farmland prices as of Feb. 1 were
up for the first time in six years, averaging $564 per acre, a 3
percent increase from the 19-year low of $548 per acre on Feb. 1,
1987.
   Despite the increase, farmland prices nationally remained far
below the peak of $823 per acre in 1982, before large debt, reduced
exports, lower commodity prices and high interest rates triggered
the slide.
   The latest report said that a May 1 survey showed farmland
prices were estimated to climb an additional 1.8 percent since Feb.
1. However, that was before the current drought set in across much
of the country.
   Some analysts believe the recovery in farmland values will
continue _ or at least hold steady _ despite the bad news from
drought. Higher commodity prices and lower levels of surplus grain
could help maintain land prices, they say.

   The Agriculture Department says
drought-stricken counties no longer will have to have Washington's
approval before making emergency feed programs available to
livestock producers.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, said Thursday that
each county committee will have the authority to make the
declaration based on a determination of substantial feed loss in
the county.
   Previously, the procedure required the agency's county
committees to submit requests for emergency feed help to the state
office for review. If approved, the state committee would then
forward the request to ASCS headquarters.
   The aid involves the Emergency Feed Program and the Emergency
Feed Assistance Program.
   Under the Emergency Feed Program, the USDA pays eligible
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace
that which is normally produced on the farm. The Emergency Feed
Assistance Program allows the sale of USDA-owned grain at reduced
prices _ 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate.
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa told reporters of the change in
program approval earlier in the day after meeting at USDA with
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   ``This is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of
questions in the country, that are hurting the livestock
producers,'' he said. ``And I think it is a very positive
development.''
   As of July 7, the feed programs were approved by USDA for 492
counties in 22 states. Overall, 1,880 counties in 37 states are on
the department's drought list.
   The emergency feed programs will now be available in all the
remaining designated counties at the discretion of county
committees.

   ``Taco'' took on a new meaning on
election day in Mexico, when fraudulent voters folded a ballot in
half like a tortilla, filled it with other votes and stuffed it
into ballot boxes.
   As opposition parties in this northern industrial center
denounced widespread fraud in presidential elections, local
newspapers reported Thursday that the ``taco'' tactic of vote
rigging was well planned and favored the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   The party, known as the PRI, claimed victory in Wednesday's
presidential election with candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   About 50 ballots make a fine ``taco.'' Discovering ``tacos'' and
revealing the ``taqueros,'' people who stuff ballot boxes, became
an election day frenzy for the media and opposition political
parties.
   The daily newspapers El Porvenir and El Norte reported Thursday
that their reporters passed themselves off as laborers or labor
union supporters to gain access to ``taco'' operations.
   The papers named the Mexican Labor Federation and the
Revolutionary Federation of Workers and Peasants, two of the
largest unions in the country and important arms of the PRI, as
prime ``taqueros.''
   ``El Porvenir reporters who passed themselves off as workers
from both unions formed part of the brigades of voters, verifiying
the introduction of so-called tacos,'' El Porvenir reported.
   ``Tacos Tarnish Elections,'' read a headline in El Norte.
   A teachers' union sponsored classes on how to use ``tacos,'' El
Norte reported.
   El Norte's Francisco Betancourt reported that he convinced the
Revolutionary Federation he wanted to help stuff ballot boxes.
   He said he went to the union's headquarters on election day and
was among those given ``packets of ballots already marked in favor
of the PRI.''
   Betancourt said he was driven along with other ``taqueros'' to a
precinct, but fled before doing anything illegal. He turned his
``taco'' in at El Norte.
   El Porvenir said one of its reporters, Jose Juan Olvera, was
discovered trying to pass himself off as a Revolutionary Federation
``taquero'' and ``received a punch in the face.''
   But union spokesman Isaias Vazquez said in a telephone interview
that the union ``at no time attacked any reporter and neither did
it promote the violation of electoral laws. Yes, we had tacos, but
they were of the corn and flour kind.''
   Olga Roman, a secretary at Mexican Labor Federation
headquarters, said union spokesmen were out of the office and
unavailable for comment.
   The newspapers and opposition parties alleged many other types
of voter fraud, including people voting more than once, refusals to
allow opposition poll watchers into polling places and ballot boxes
already filled before voting began.
   In Chihuahua, meanwhile, the main opposition party, National
Action, complained of widespread irregularities, including the
elimination from voter rolls of thousands of its sympathizers.
   The party's strength is in the northern state's two large
cities, the city of Chihuahua and Ciudad Juarez across the border
from El Paso, Texas.
   In many of the precincts checked by journalists late Wednesday
as the votes were being tallied, the difference in favor of
National Action was as little as 20 to 40 votes.
   Hundreds of sympathizers carrying their voting cards showed up
at party headquarters to complain their names did not appear on the
voter rolls. There were no similar reports by PRI sympathizers.
   ``This is a dictatorship,'' said Leopoldo Corral, who complained
he had waited for hours only to be told he could not vote.
   Electoral Commission president Miguel Etzal Maldonado blamed the
elimination of names from the voter rolls on ``technical
failures.'' Gov. Fernando Baeza said they were ``natural human
errors.''
   PRI officials declined to release any election figures in the
state and said the Electoral Commission would have official results
on Sunday.

   Congressional demands to have the Air Force
and Navy seal U.S. borders against illegal drug shipments have been
turned aside by the Pentagon and legislators who say the Defense
Department already has enough to do.
   ``I think we changed a lot of minds with our hearings,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as
he detailed a Pentagon budget bill approved Thursday by
congressional negotiators.
   Nunn was the prime mover behind a series of committee hearings
last month at which Pentagon officials said giving them increased
anti-drug responsibilities would hurt the military's main mission
of being ready to defend the nation against enemies.
   The House had earlier voted to order President Reagan to have
the Pentagon essentially seal U.S. borders against drug traffickers
within 45 days. The Senate approved arrest powers for Navy officers
aboard warships which stop drug boats on the high seas.
   Both proposals were dropped in the final version of the bill.
   The final measure does order the Pentagon to improve and expand
its role in providing anti-drug intelligence to civilian law
enforcement agencies, including more extensive tracking of ships
and planes.
   The $300 billion bill also sharply reduces Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile plan, although it has money for thousands of missiles,
planes, tanks and other weapons.
   The measure, which authorizes Pentagon spending for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, must now be passed separately by the House
and Senate before going to the White House for Reagan's signature.
   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion. The
total is a slight reduction from the $301 billion authorized in the
current year and marks the fourth straight year of either freezing
or reducing the defense budget, following large increases during
Reagan's first term.
   The Pentagon spending bill authorizes $4.0 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Reagan's 5-year-old Star Wars plan
is formally known. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for the program,
up $900 million from the $3.9 billion this year.
   The bill also sharply restricts spending for the space-based
interceptor, the weapon planned as a first phase of an eventual SDI
program. The Pentagon had sought $330 million for the program, but
the bill restricts the total to only $85 million.
   Other highlights of the bill:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PAY RAISES _ The nation's 2.1 million uniformed military
personnel will receive a 4.1 percent pay increase.
   NUCLEAR WEAPONS _ The measure proposes $250 million each for the
single-warhead Midgetman and the railroad version of the MX, a pair
of land-based nuclear missiles. Reagan wanted only $200 million for
the Midgetman, which is strongly backed by Democrats who control
both chambers, and $793 million for the MX. The bill contains
another $250 million that the secretary of defense in the new
administration next year can spend for either program.
   ARMS CONTROL _ The measure requires withdrawal and retirement of
three aging missile-firing Poseidon submarines as new
missile-firing boats are introduced into the fleet. That continues
the policy of generally keeping the United States near weapons
limits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty, a pact
Reagan says he won't follow.
   The bill also provides that the Energy Department should prepare
for a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal
of arms control supporters.
   NAVY SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Trident
missile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs,
the first of a new Seawolf-class of attack subs, three destroyers,
and an amphibious assault ship.
   OTHER WEAPONS _ The measure provides money for 180 F-16 jet
fighters, 36 F-15 fighters, a dozen F-14 jets for the Navy, 84
FA-18 jets for Navy carriers, 24 AV-8 Harrier jets, four of the new
long-range C-17 cargo planes, 669 M-1 tanks, 581 Bradley Fighting
Vehicles for the Army, 1,310 Standard missiles and 72 Apache attack
helicopters for the Army,

<HEAD>LBJ Law Would Allow Dual Candidacies For Bentsen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The last Texas Democrat to run
simultaneously for the U.S. Senate and vice president won both
races _ and later became the first Texan in the White House.
   But Lyndon Johnson's dual 1960 victories cost his party a Senate
seat they have yet to win back.
   Under the state law custom-written for Johnson in 1959, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas could pursue similar dual candidacies this
year. Bentsen, long a powerful vote-getter and money-raiser on the
Texas ballot, is among the potential running mates under
consideration by expected Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   Bentsen is a heavy favorite to win re-election to the Senate
over Republican challenger Beau Boulter, a West Texas congressman,
in November. But if Bentsen became vice president, his Senate seat
would be declared open in January, and Texas Gov. Bill Clements, a
Republican, would appoint an interim replacement.
   A full-time replacement would be picked by the voters in a
spring special election, the same route Republican John Tower used
in 1961 to replace Johnson in a wild race that drew 70 candidates.
   Tower and Bill Blakley, a Democrat appointed as interim senator
by then-Democratic Gov. John Connally, advanced to a runoff, which
Tower won.
   The Democrats could never beat Tower. He retired in 1984, and
Republican Phil Gramm won the seat.
   Texas Democrats eager to see Bentsen on the national ticket say
they do not fear a recurrence of the GOP's big win in 1961.
   ``We're confident that if the Democratic ticket wins and Sen.
Bentsen is vice president there is going to be an attitude and mood
in this state that would facilitate electing a Democrat to replace
Sen. Bentsen,'' said Ed Martin, executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party.
   It would be, however, a junior Democratic senator whose clout
would be far less than that now wielded by Bentsen as Senate
Finance Committee chairman.
   Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said the possibility of
losing the Senate seat is ``always a matter of concern.''
   ``But that doesn't cause me to wish Sen. Bentsen was not on the
ticket'' with Dukakis, he said.
   Mark Sanders, spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, said
the GOP ``could pick up'' Bentsen's seat in a special election but
it would be a tough battle. Running for both jobs, though legal in
Texas, is not fair, he said.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen needs to decide what he wants to be,'' Sanders
said. ``I don't think it's the right thing to do for someone to run
for two offices, especially important offices like this. You can't
play games like that with Texas voters.''
   Boulter, Bentsen's senate race opponent, said it would be
``greedy'' for Bentsen to run for two jobs.
   ``He's making it look like the Senate is unimportant,'' Boulter
said.

<HEAD>Premier Accepts Resignation of New Health Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's health minister, who has come under fire
for controversial statements on AIDS testing and drug addiction,
has resigned after nine days in office, Premier Michel Rocard's
office announced.
   Rocard had asked for Leon Schwarzenberg's resignation, saying
the respected cancer specialist infringed on a ``code of ethics''
by making controversial statements despite the premier's request
that new ministers refrain from making broad policy announcements.
Schwarzenberg resigned Thursday.
   In a news conference Tuesday, Schwarzenberg proposed systematic
testing of pregnant women for AIDS. He declined to say whether the
tests should be mandatory.
   Health policy under former conservative Minister of Health
Michele Barzach specifically opposed mandatory AIDS testing, a
position that received broad public support.
   Pregnant women in France are routinely tested for AIDS, but only
at the discretion of individual physicians.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Schwarzenberg also advocated the distribution of drugs, under
certain conditions, to drug addicts through French hospitals. The
plan provoked a heated response from many French doctors and
politicians.
   The new health minister was one of several ``civil''
appointments to a Socialist Cabinet that Rocard has tried to
broaden by including centrists and non-politicians.
   Integrating the new personalities into the government has proven
difficult. On Wednesday, Rocard was forced to reverse a policy
statement made a day earlier by Justice Minister Pierre
Arpaillange, who recommended changes in the policy governing
solitary confinement of some prisoners convicted of murder,
including terrorists. Arpaillange did not provide details on his
plan.
   Following an outcry in the National Assembly and in the press,
Rocard announced that after consulting with Arpaillange, a
respected jurist, present solitary confinement practices would
remain in effect.

   Governing party candidate Carlos Salinas de
Gortari claimed a ``national victory'' Thursday in Mexico's
presidential election. His party dismissed opposition charges of
massive fraud as a publicity move.
   In his first public appearance since polls closed Wednesday
evening, Salinas de Gortari addressed thousands of supporters
packed into the Institutional Revolutionary Party headquarters.
   ``We have achieved national victory in the presidential
election,'' he told the crowd, which responded by chanting: ``We
have won, We have won.''
   ``We have achieved this victory in one of the most contested
elections in our history and one of the most peaceful,'' Salinas de
Gortari added.
   In an apparent concession that his party had lost some
congressional races, he said the ``legal victories'' of the
opposition would be respected.
   ``Information allows us to see that the opposition groups show a
majority force in several districts of the country,'' Salinas de
Gortari said. ``It is the new political reality of the nation, and
with which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful
fashion.''
   Early results showed Salinas de Gortari leading the four
opposition candidates.
   An official of the Federal Election Commission, which supervised
Wednesday's balloting, said Salinas de Gortari received 96,379
votes, or 41.8 percent of the 230,516 counted.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front and
the Mexican Socialist Party received 80,680 votes, or 34.9 percent,
and Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party
had 37,742, or 16.4 percent.
   Gumersindo Magana of the conservative Mexican Democratic Party
got 2,235 votes, or just under 1 percent, and Rosario Ibarra de
Piedra of the radical Revolutionary Workers Party with less than
half a percent, or 1,067 ballots.
   The results showed listed 11,573 votes annulled, 70 blank
ballots and 770 write-ins.
   The turnout among the estimated 38 million registered voters has
not been announced, so it was not known what percentage of the vote
the results repreented.
   Octavio Campos, an Interior Department spokesman, said no
further partial results were expected before Sunday, and Interior
Secretary Manuel Bartlett, who heads the Election Commission,
suspended counting until Sunday.
   Bartlett told commission officials at a Thursday evening session
there had been a delay in tabulating votes but that the process
would be speeded up. He did not elaborate on the delay.
   ``We have had difficulties in receiving information but we are
now able to say that the delay will be replaced by a better flow of
results,'' Bartlett said.
   Election Commission officials earlier blamed a computer failure
for the delay in announcing results. Later they said results from
around the country were being received by telephone.
   President Miguel de la Madrid's six-year term expires Dec. 1,
and under the Constitution he cannot be re-elected.
   In addition to chosing a president, voters also chose a new
500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 64-member Senate. Opposition
parties were expected to gain in the congress, which in the past
few years has begun to shed its rubberstamp image.
   Before the first returns were announced at 1:30 a.m., Jorge de
la Vega Dominguez, president of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, announced ``a crushing, legal and incontestable
victory'' for Salinas de Gortari.
   Since its founding 1929, the PRI has won every presidential
election and has controlled the national congress and the
governorships of all 31 states.
   But this year, a clear deterioration of the PRI's influence was
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by Cardenas and Clouthier.
   Cardenas, Clouthier and Mrs. Ibarra de Piedra with federal
officials Wednesday night and issued a statement accusing the
government of rigging the election.
   The statement accused the government of stuffing ballot boxes,
eliminating citizens from voting rolls, paying people to vote and
multiple voting.
   ``The anticipated announcement of a supposed victory of the
official party under these conditions, long before the counting
process was completed, reaffirms our suspicions that a fraud of
great proportions is being conjured,'' the statement said. Mrs.
Ibarra de Piedra read the statement as Cardenas and Clouthier stood
by.
   PRI representatives called the complaint a publicity move by the
three candidates and challenged them to present proof supporting
their allegations.
   In the northern states of Chihuahua and Nuevo Leon, the
government's claims of a fair election were met with widespread
skepticism.
   The Monterrey newspaper El Norte said fraud was widespread in
Salinas de Gortari's adopted hometown of Agualeguas, in northern
Nuevo Leon state near the U.S. border.
   El Norte, which had reporters at each of Agualeguas' three
precincts count the number of people who voted, reported that 626
people cast ballots, but the tally compiled by PRI pollwatchers
totaled 1,725 votes.
   The newspaper said it had a picture of an 8-year-old boy who
voted with his father's voting card. PRI officials denied the
reports.
   The Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a citizens'
watchdog group, reported 1,100 cases of balloting irregularities,
including 500 in the Mexican capital alone.
   The campaign was not without bloodshed.
   Gunmen on Saturday killed Francisco Xavier Ovando, a strategist
in Cardenas' campaign, and an aide to Ovando.
   Police said Tuesday that the murders were not related to the
election but to Ovando's tenure as Michoacan attorney general.
During that time, Ovando fought organized crime.
   Cardenas called the slayings ``a provocation.''

   An out-of-control car smashed through the
wall surrounding Elvis Presley's Graceland manor, and a guard later
stood watch to keep fans from carrying off broken bricks,
authorities said.
   Detrich Michelle Hardy, 21, was charged with failure to maintain
proper control of her vehicle and driving without a license in the
accident early Thursday, the Memphis Police Department reported.
   ``Usually, most people wait for the place to open in the morning
to get access to the property,'' Graceland spokesman Todd Morgan

   Hardy and a male companion were speeding down Elvis Presley
Boulevard when they ``lost control for some reason, took a sharp
left and drove through the stone wall that is in front of
Graceland,'' Morgan said.
   The car ended up in the large yard in front of the white house.
There were no injuries, Morgan said. ``We've had a guard on the
wall all day today to keep pieces of the wall from going home as
souvenirs,'' he added.

   A Lebanese man charged with
murdering a U.S. Navy diver during a 1985 hijacking had been put on
probation in 1983 after a court ruled he was not likely to break
the law again, court evidence indicated.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on
charges of murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a
TWA jetliner on an Athens-to-Rome flight.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Md., was shot to
death after the hijackers forced the plane to land in Beirut.
Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal.
   During a brief hearing Thursday, the court heard a document from
a court in the southern West German state of Saarland, which
convicted Hamadi of theft and assault.
   Hamadi was charged with stealing a cash box from a street vendor
and with assault after he smashed it into the face of a man who
tried to stop the robbery, the document said.
   The court gave Hamadi a suspended nine-month sentence in 1983
after ruling that there was ``no evidence that the defendant is
predisposed to further criminal behavior.''
   The court said it believed Hamadi, who was ordered to perform
120 hours of community service work, would learn from the
experience and not break the law again. Hamadi lived in Saarland
from 1982 to 1984.
   The document also is being used by the Frankfurt court in an
attempt to determine Hamadi's exact age.
   The Saarland state court document listed Hamadi's date of birth
as June 13, 1964. Hamadi says he was born in 1966.
   The ruling on age is important because it will determine the
length of any sentence Hamadi receives if convicted. The range is
from 15 years to life.
   Also Thursday, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger read a statement
obtained from Hamadi after he was arrested at Frankfurt airport on
Jan. 13, 1987, with liquid explosives in his possession.
   According to the statement, Hamadi said he thought the bottles
contained alcohol. He said he was to carry the bottles from Beirut
to Frankfurt and deliver them to an acquaintance named Ahmed.
   Hamadi said he was returning to West Germany to try to set up a
car dealership.
   His statement to police at the time also listed his birth date
as June 13, 1964.
   Asked by Mueckenberger if he had anything to say, Hamadi looked
at his lawyer and declined to comment.
   The trial, which began Tuesday under heavy security in a
specially constructed prison courtroom, adjourned after about an
hour Thursday because a witness who knew Hamadi during his previous
stay in West Germany was unable to attend Thursday's session.
   The witness, a social worker, originally had been scheduled to
testify July 13 but was later asked by the court to appear Thursday.
   The trial's first two sessions have been cut short, raising
prospects the proceedings could extend into next year. Officials
already have scheduled court days into December and say more could
be added.
   Tuesday's opening session was suspended after Hamadi refused to
participate.
   The United States tried unsuccessfully to have Hamadi extradited
to stand trial in a U.S. court.
   The trial is to resume July 13.
   A Duesseldorf court sentenced Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Ali
Hamadi, to 13 years in prison in April for kidnapping two West
Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain his brother's freedom.
   One hostage later was released, but the second still is being
held in Beirut by a radical Shiite group.

   After 20 years, a Vietnam veteran finally was
able to tell the mother of a buddy killed in the war how much her
son was admired and respected, thanks to some unorthodox help from
advice columnist Ann Landers.
   After trying unsuccessfully to locate the man's family, Ms.
Landers decided to publish a letter from veteran Gil Noble, who
wrote that he wanted Kevin H. Dugan's parents to know ``how much
their son was admired and respected by the men he served with''
before his death in 1968.
   She telephoned several Dugans in Kevin's hometown of Blue Point,
N.Y., but no one knew him, she said.
   Finally, Ms. Landers decided to break her rule against
publishing the names of letter writers and use Noble's name
Tuesday, in hopes that a reader of her nationally syndicated column
would know Kevin's family.
   ``I felt the letter from Gil Noble was so sincere,'' she said.
   Kevin's mother, Anne Dugan Brown, who has remarried but still
lives in Blue Point, said a neighbor called to tell her about the
column, and the phone then rang all day.
   ``We were all a little teary-eyed at first,'' Ms. Brown said,
``but I felt it was a wonderful tribute to (Kevin's) memory.''

   Actress Cindy Gibb says she shed her serious
side to expose the ``kooky, eclectic and frantic'' aspects of her
personality in the movie, ``Short Circuit 2.''
   Miss Gibb, 24, a co-star in the ``Fame'' television series for
three years, has played such serious roles as doomed nun Jean
Donovan in Oliver Stone's ``Salvador'' and the title role in ``The
Karen Carpenter Story,'' set for broadcast this fall on CBS.
   In ``Short Circuit 2,'' the sequel to the 1986 film about a
human-like robot, Miss Gibb plays a toy buyer desperate for a new
toy for the upcoming Christmas season.
   ``I did `Short Circuit 2' because I had never done light comedy
and it gave me a chance to bring out that kooky, eclectic and
frantic side of Cindy Gibb,'' she said recently.

   Paul Revere, the 1960s rock 'n' roll star and
namesake of the Revolutionary War hero, says he has found solid
financial ground in Idaho real estate.
   Revere, 49, founded and led the group Paul Revere and the
Raiders, which had such hits in the late 1960s and early 1970s as
``Kicks,'' ``Hungry,'' and ``Indian Reservation.''
   Revere and the band continue after numerous personnel changes
over the years, although Revere spends a lot of time playing the
land-and-development market as well.
   ``My brother owned a real estate company in Boise (Idaho) and
was always looking for exceptional property,'' he said in a recent

   Revere was always a go-getter, starting as a teen-age barber in
Caldwell, Idaho. He used his earnings to invest in a small drive-in
restaurant and ``started a rock 'n' roll band to promote my

   Republican George Bush says he has to do a
better job of telling Americans ``what makes me tick inside'' while
voters need to learn where Democratic rival Michael Dukakis really
stands on the issues.
   The vice president complained Thursday that one recent poll
found that two-thirds of the people believed Dukakis was more
conservative than Bush. ``There's something wrong with that,'' Bush
said. ``The issues are not in focus. ... I honestly believe that
the country doesn't yet fully appreciate where the governor stands
... on a lot of key issues.''
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, made
his observations during a foray into Dukakis' home turf of Boston,
where he spoke before a Greek-American audience whose political
sympathies could be expected to rest with Dukakis.
   However, the audience of several thousand people gave Bush a
surprisingly warm reception.
   The vice president said it had been a smart idea to have him and
Dukakis speak on separate days. ``Too much charisma can be
dangerous to your health,'' Bush joked.
   Today, the vice president flies to Atlanta for a pep talk to a
Republican unity dinner in the same city where Dukakis will claim
the Democratic presidential nomination this month.
   At a news conference Thursday, Bush said he has not done a
sufficient job telling the nation what kind of person he is.
   He said: ``I've not felt too comfortable talking about the
private side of the Bush family and all of that _ what it means to
me, the loss of a child, whatever it might be.
   ``I now have concluded that I have to make clear what makes me
tick inside.''
   Referring to a speech Wednesday before a Hispanic audience in
which he talked at length about his life, Bush said, ``I was trying
to say, look, I understand this, here's what motiviates me, here's
the inner side.''
   He jokingly said he ``wasn't trying to draw a contrast that
we've got 12 grandchildren and he's (Dukakis) working for one.''
However, Bush's wife, Barbara, quickly corrected him on the number
of grandchildren, and the vice president said, ``Make that 10.''
   Talking about the campaign, Bush said he would ``be positive,''
outlining his views, while surrogates focus on Dukakis' record and
what they feel are its shortcomings, ``factually, without venom,
without vendetta.''
   Nevertheless, Bush said he had ``an enormous difference on
taxes'' with Dukakis. The vice president said he opposed new taxes
while Dukakis recently oversaw an increase in cigarette taxes in
Massachusetts.
   Bush also suggested he would do a better job than Dukakis in the
area of foreign affairs.
   The vice president said he would talk about ``who has the most
experience, who best (is qualified) to sit down with Mr. (Mikhail)
Gorbachev, (the leader of the Soviet Union), what administration
has achieved the only arms control agreement in the nuclear age to
eliminate an entire category of weapons when some were sitting up
here saying `Freeze, freeze,' lock in Soviet superiority with a
thousand warheads and zero for the United States.''
   Bush flew to Boston after a political strategy session with
President Reagan at the White House.
   In a break with tradition, Bush likely will campaign for votes
and try to divert attention from Dukakis during the Democratic
National Convention, which runs July 18-21.
   Sheila Tate, the vice president's press secretary, said
schedulers were looking at events on Monday and Tuesday of
convention week, followed by appearances Friday and Saturday after
the convention closes.
   Usually, the presidential candidates allow each other to have
all the limelight during their conventions, and expect the same
courtesy in return.
   Yet Bush, who has trailed in many polls until just recently,
said he probably would do some political travel during Dukakis'
convention.
   On the one hand, Bush said, ``we'd just get a little bit of
ink'' by being on the road.
   On the other hand, he said, ``you don't want to look like you're
trying to frantically elbow your way into the news cycle.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Shows Iranians Responded To Warship Warnings In Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says the record of a radio
encounter between an Iranian F-14 and a U.S. cruiser shows that
Iranian aircraft respond to warnings from U.S. warships in the
Persian Gulf, unlike Iran Air flight 655, which was shot down last
Sunday.
   The Iranian A300 Airbus did not reply to seven warnings
broadcast by the warship which shot it down, the USS Vincennes, and
five from another American vessel in the area, the USS John H.
Sides, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   To demonstrate that ignoring such warnings was unusual, Howard
released a previously classified conversation between an Iranian
F-14 fighter and the Leahy class guided missile cruiser USS Halsey.
   The conversation took place last Saturday, the day before the
Airbus was shot down with 290 civilians aboard.
   HALSEY: ``Unidentified warship bearing 3:10 speed 400 knots,
altitude 2,000 feet, you are approaching an American warship,
operating in international waters, bearing 1:29, 26 nautical miles
from you. Request you to establish communications and identify
yourself and state your intentions.''
   IRANIAN F-14: ``Roger. An Iranian. We will place you about 5
nautical miles.''
   HALSEY: From U.S. naval warship, say again.''
   IRANIAN F-14: ``We want to place your warship at about 10
nautical miles.''
   HALSEY: ``Roger, out.''
   IRANIAN F-14: ``Roger.''
   Howard said the text was ``the sum total of the transcript. The
Iranian aircraft went away.''
   ``He identified himself and established where he was. Now the
events worked out. There was no hostile intent. These aircraft were
tracked.''
   Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf,
Marine Corps Gen. George B. Crist, cited another instance, in which
an Iranian F-4 came ``a little close'' to a U.S. ship ``and our
ship challenged him. He said, `I'm on my way to engage an Iraqi.''

<HEAD>Military Directive for Personnel With AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army and Air Force have ordered
commanding officers to tell soldiers or airmen who test positive
for the AIDS virus that they face discharge or prosecution unless
they inform all sex partners of their condition and use condoms.
   The regulations, and a similar Navy policy, spell out rules of
behavior at issue in a number of cases in which military personnel
who have tested positive for the AIDS virus have been charged with
criminal offenses. The charges have ranged from aggravated assault
to having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results.
   In an AIDS-related court-martial scheduled to start at Arizona's
Fort Huachuca this month, defense lawyers have argued that the
defendant was not ordered either to use condoms or to inform
partners of his condition.
   All members of the military must submit to AIDS blood screening
tests, which detect the presence of antibodies and indicate whether
a person has been exposed to the virus.
   The Army regulation, which became effective April 1, requires a
commander to discuss a written counseling statement with any
soldier who has tested positive and has received medical
counseling, said Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman at the
Pentagon.
   The form states that the commander is ``imposing the following
restrictions: `You will verbally advise all prospective sexual
partners of your diagnosed condition prior to engaging in any
sexual intercourse. You are also ordered to use condoms should you
engage in sexual intercourse with a partner.'''
   Rixon said the form also states that failure ``to adhere to your
previous medical counseling or the counseling I have just given you
will subject you to administrative separation and-or punishment
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice as I see fit.''
   ``This is serious business,'' Rixon said recently. ``Those words
take the form of a direct order.''
   Col. Harry Beans, staff judge advocate at Fort Huachuca in
Sierra Vista in southeastern Arizona, said, ``We don't order them
to refrain from sex. I don't think we could do that.'' But, he
said, partners must be informed ``so that he or she can make an
informed decision.''
   The upcoming court-martial at Fort Huachuca, initiated by the
Army in 1987, was the military's first AIDS-related prosecution.
Then-Pfc. Adrian G. Morris Jr. is accused of failing to use condoms
and to warn three soldiers with whom he had sex, including one man,
that he had tested positive for the virus.
   His lawyers have argued that there was no order for Morris to do
either in July 1986, when he was informed of the virus' potential
danger and counseled that he should inform partners and use a
condom.
   His court-martial was delayed while a ruling on blood test
admissibility was appealed.
   In the meantime, a soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, pleaded guilty
last December to AIDS-related charges, including disobeying an
officer's order virtually identical to the new regulation.
   Several other military AIDS-related cases have been tried,
including that of a soldier at Fort Sill, Okla., who pleaded guilty
to aggravated assault and of an airman at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base, Ohio, who was convicted on such a charge.
   Rixon said that as the element of assault kept coming up, ``it
became clear that we needed a very definitive guideline to assure
there is a standardization of orders.''
   The Air Force regulation, similar to the Army's, provides a form
that must be signed by both the affected airman and his or her
commander. Signing acknowledges that the person has been given the
directive and understands it.
   The Air Force order also requires those carrying the AIDS virus
to inform medical personnel treating them.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Kenneth Ross in Washington said the similar
Navy policy took effect in January.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Beans said the Army policy tells AIDS carriers ``rather
precisely'' what their responsibilities are, but he thinks
``individuals are going to argue that they did take those steps and
preventative measures.''
   That proved to be a successful defense in at least one case. On
May 11, Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class John E. Crawford was acquitted
of charges including assault and having wrongfully and in wanton
disregard for human life exposed his former girlfriend to the AIDS
virus.
   ``It's gonna be an odd case that comes along where someone says
he didn't warn his partner,'' Beans said.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Death Penalty For Drugs, Trafficking In Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has approved the death
penalty for people convicted of drug offenses or trafficking in
women, the government announced today.
   The action was taken late Thursday by the 300-seat Parliament,
in which President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's ruling Jatiya Party
has a four-fifths majority.
   Ershad was expected to sign the new laws quickly.
   The legislation sets a minimum penalty of seven years in jail
and a maximum penalty of death for drug-related crimes. Earlier,
the maximum sentence was 10 years in jail.
   There had been no law against trafficking in women, which has
been an increasing problem in Bangladesh.
   Police and border guards say that more than 4,000 women have
been rescued from being taken illegally across the border into
India this year.
   The security forces say the women are lured with promises of
jobs outside Bangladesh, but often end up sold into prostitution.
   The new women's protection law sets a minimum penalty of seven
years in jail for traffickers and a maximum of death.
   Prime Minister Moudud Ahmed told the Parliament that the new
laws would act as a deterrent to crimes involving drugs and against
women.
   ``Let us hope we are not required to apply the laws,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Consultant: Bush's Gender Gap Problem Could Beat Him In

   A Republican political consultant says George
Bush will lose in November if he doesn't get the support of more
women, and that even a woman running mate would not help
substantially.
   The problem of ``gender gap'' is so serious that overcoming it
is probably the most important demographic key to a Bush victory,
said Doug Bailey, a respected GOP consultant.
   ``If he doesn't bridge the gender gap he will not win ... There
are not enough white men available for George Bush to win this
election,'' Bailey said Thursday at a news conference called by the
National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs.
   Bailey predicted that Bush, the likely Republican nominee, will
win, however, by making changes in his campaign strategy to make
him more appealing to women voters.
   He recommended that the vice president concentrate on making his
own family more visible at campaign appearances, and make a more
forceful commitment to issues like long-term health care, job
security and education.

<HEAD>South Carolina Senator Favors Texan as Dukakis Running Mate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., says he is
leaning toward Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as a running mate for
Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis.
   Hollings, who last month said he would support Greenville, S.C.,
native Jesse Jackson for president at the Democratic National
Convention, on Thursday also warned Dukakis against overly
accommodating the civil rights leader.
   ``It was ill-advised under (1984 Democratic nominee Walter)
Mondale and now to fall into this same thing of calling him in is
not well-advised,'' Hollings said.
   While Hollings reiterated his support for Jackson at the
national convention in Atlanta later this month, he indicated he
would not take a lead role in lobbying for him.

<HEAD>Dukakis Edges Bush in Mock Student Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is favored among
student voters, if the results of a mock presidential election held
recently at a meeting of high school student council leaders is any
indication.
   The National Association of Secondary School Principals, which
sponsored the event, said Thursday that Dukakis, the probable
Democratic nominee, received 316 votes to 302 for Vice President
George Bush, the likely Republican standardbearer.
   The ballots were cast last week during the annual conference of
the National Association of Student Councils in Albuquerque, N.M.
   But there was one consolation for the loser: Only 64 of the
students said they would be old enough to vote in November.

<HEAD>N.H. Governor Says ``Refugees'' Fleeing Dukakis' Massachusetts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican governor of New Hampshire says
tens of thousands of ``refugees'' from Massachusetts are fleeing to
his state each year to escape the policies of Democratic Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   ``You ought to stand at the border and talk to them when they
come into New Hampshire,'' said Gov. John Sununu, who is active in
Republican George Bush's presidential campaign, in remarks Thursday
at the National Press Club.
   ``The state of Massachusetts in fact has the reality of between
50,000 and 100,000 leaving the state in the last five or six years.
We in New Hampshire in fact get 10,000 to 20,000 refugees a year
who escape with their families,'' Sununu said.
   ``They have perceived mismanagement, they have perceived a
propensity to tax, they're not happy with the quality of service
they receive,'' said Sununu, who has been speaking around the
country on Dukakis' record as Massachsuetts governor as part of
Bush's surrogate speaker program.

   The cornstalks that should have been at Pete
Kodat's eyes barely reached the silver buckle on his hand-tooled,
brown leather belt. The soybeans that should have been flourishing
full green leaves hugged the dusty, dry soil instead.
   ``If you want to bring this home to the people in the cities,''
said Kodat, 40, the third generation of a family whose roots in
Grundy County stretch back to the 1800s, ``tell them to imagine
what it's like to be facing a full year of expenses with very
little income.''
   Exactly how little depends on how soon his prayers get answered
during the worst drought to hit the nation's midsection since the
1930s Dust Bowl.
   Last year, each of Kodat's 720 acres of corn yielded between 140
and 160 bushels. But last year 9.98 inches of rain fell between
April and July 1.
   This year, only 3.96 inches have fallen over the same period of
time. And many, perhaps most, of those same acres could yield no
corn at all.
   Kodat has higher hopes for his 540-acre bean crop because the
plants have lapsed into a dormant stage _ a kind of natural defense
against the drought. But continued dryness would ravage them as
well _ cutting deeply into a yield he patiently raised to 40
bushels per acre.
   ``If we catch some of the rain they're predicting for this
weekend and temperatures moderate,'' Kodat said Thursday, ``I might
still get out with 40 or 50 percent of my corn and 70 percent of my
beans.
   ``But if another two or three weeks pass (without rain),
there'll be no pollination. And what you'll be looking at are ears
of corn with no kernels on them.''
   When Kodat put the seeds into the ground April 17, he was aiming
at the modest price of about $2 per bushel. With an investment of
about $250 per acre, he figured to pocket between $30 and $60
profit on each.
   But like some cruel joke, the same drought that has driven the
commodity market to push the price of corn to $3 per bushel is
threatening to destroy many of the farmers who grow it.
   ``This is a medium-sized operation ... like a lot of the ones
around here. Now maybe only 3 or 4 percent of the farmers are going
to take a hit they can't outlast,'' said Kodat. ``But maybe a lot
more are just going to throw in the towel.''
   Not far from the Kodats' brown, brick four-bedroom home, about
75,000 bushels of corn harvested from last year's bumper crop sit
in four aluminum-sided silos, and not far away from those graze
some cattle the Kodats raise for their own table.
   His wife, Carla, hasn't cut back on the groceries _ and doesn't
plan to. At least not right away.
   ``Things haven't changed for us right now, and I tell him every
morning that worrying won't make any difference anyway,'' she said.
``Everybody's in the same shape, it just seems so senseless.''
   So the Kodats pray instead. Every day.
   ``I started farming when I was a freshman in high school with 80
acres and a little help from my dad and I've been at it ever
since,'' said Kodat, adding that when times were lean in the early
1970s, he left the farm and took a job sweeping floors at the
nearby Commonwealth Edison nuclear power plant.
   Debt, he figures, is an occupational hazard.
   ``No matter what happens, I won't be planting any less next
year. In fact, I expect I'll be planting more.
   ``But the hardest part about this is getting up every morning
and trying not to think about it,'' he said. ``Because there is
absolutely nothing you can do.''

<HEAD>Army Called Out To Rescue Flood Victims, Toll Rises To 91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army was called out today to help
rescue an estimated 4 million people stranded by flooding as the
death toll in five days of monsoon rains reached 91, officials and
newspapers said.
   At least 27 people were killed Thursday as floodwaters spread
from the country's northeast into the southeast district of
Chittigong, the Bengali-language newspapers Ittihad and Sangbad
reported today.
   Two of the victims Thursday were reported drowned in Chittigong.
All the earlier victims were in the northeast, along the Indian
border.
   Army units began moving into flooded areas today after the
cabinet decided the night before to call out the force, said
officials at the Flood Control Ministry who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Bengali-language newspapers said 4 million people were
marooned, many trapped atop their homes or even in trees. Thousands
of mud-and-thatch houses have been washed away by the surging
waters, the papers said.
   About 50,000 people have been moved to 20 relief centers in
schools and other public buildings, the papers reported.
   Iqbal Hossain Chowdhury, a government official supervising
rescue work in the town of Sunamganj, said by telephone that 90
percent of the northeastern town was under water.
   ``This seems to be an unprecedented flood in recent memory,'' he
said.
   Bangladesh, a largely lowland nation of 105 million people, is
regularly inundated as its many rivers overflow during the monsoon.
Last year, 1,200 people were killed in flooding.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips, Stock Prices Gain In Early Tokyo Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing prices, comment from
analysts; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen at the
close of the trading week Friday, while stocks advanced.
   After opening at 131.95 yen, the dollar closed trading only
slightly higher at 131.97 yen, down 0.33 yen from Thursday's close
of 132.40. It traded mainly between 131.90 yen and 132.60 yen
during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 38.47-point loser Thursday, advanced 188.95
points, or 0.68 percent, to close the week at 27,917.08.
   The dollar overcame an early, speculative sell-off to recover in
morning dealings. On Monday the currency hit 134.85 yen, its
highest closing rate since Nov. 24.
   ``It recovered after opening lower on the tail of a weaker
currency in New York and is coming up little by little,'' said a
currency dealer with a major Tokyo commercial bank.
   ``But dollar-buying was countered by speculative selling and
that affected the currency's rise,'' said the dealer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Others said the dollar came under pressure as investors reacted
to a comment late Thursday by Japan's Trade Minister Hajime Tamura.
   Tamura, speaking to a group of foreign reporters in Tokyo,
denied reports of a clandestine U.S.-Japan agreement to prop up the
dollar for political reasons.
   Tokyo currency dealers have said that Japanese and U.S. monetary
authorities are favoring a higher dollar for mainly political
reasons.
   According to currency analysts, a stronger dollar would pave the
way for more latitude in managing monetary policy, reducing fears
of inflation, circumventing higher interest rates and ensuring the
health of U.S. financial markets.
   Such developments would likely increase the chances of a
Republican Party victory in the November presidential polls, they
said.
   In stock market dealings, security houses were traded along with
pharmaceuticals and retailers, while steelmakers and heavy
industries were generally down.

Auction</HEAD>

   In 1974, Vladimir Nemukhin and Bela Levikova
helped organize an outdoor art show that drew cool reviews from KGB
agents, who bulldozed the artwork.
   On Thursday, the two Soviet artists displayed their work at the
country's first international art auction, an unlikely event that
raked in $3.6 million from a flock of art-loving foreigners.
   About 2,000 people crowded into a hall at the International
Trade Center for the auction organized by Sotheby's of London. In
two hectic hours, 120 works of art were put up for bids.
   The event drew more than a little curiosity in a country where
prices usually are regulated by bureacrats.
   ``Maybe money is a bad standard for merit, but it's a worldwide
standard,'' said Nikolai Filatov, a Ukranian-born artist who had
two works sold.
   Art that deviated from the principles of Socialist Realism once
met with the Kremlin's disdain. KGB agents used dump trucks and
bulldozers to literally crush the exhibition that Nemukhin and
Levikova helped organize in a Moscow park 14 years ago.
   Bids at the auction were taken from the 1,000 people in the
audience, as well as by telephone and through written offers
submitted in advance.
   Because payment in British pounds was required, Soviets in
theory were excluded from taking part in the auction, since it is
illegal for them to hold foreign currency.
   But they made their feelings known, applauding when a
contemporary work fetched more than $400,000, and when paintings by
Ilya Glazunov, an artist with high-level official support, failed
to sell for their minimum estimated value.
   The total bids was $3.6 million, which Sotheby auctioneer Simon
de Pury said ``exceeded our wildest expectations.''
   London art dealer David Juda won a fierce bidding war with a
$567,000 offer for Alexander Rodchenko's ``Line,'' a 1920 oil
painting that depicts a white line zigzagging across a matte black
canvas.
   ``That was my very last bid,'' Juda said. ``I don't think I paid
too much _ but maybe I did.''
   In all, 18 works by artists from before World War II were
auctioned off. But the bulk of the works on sale was by
contemporary artists.
   One 1986 work, ``Fundamental Lexicon'' by Moscow-born Grisha
Bruskin, sold for $416,000, which de Pury said was a record for a
modern Soviet artist.
   Gowrie said rockstar Elton John had bid $75,000 for a blue-hued
landscape by modern Soviet painter Svetlana Kopystianskaya, and the
same sum for a portrait by her husband, Igor Kopystiansky.
   Juda, a veteran of art auctions, said he though Western interest
in Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev reforms had caused a new
curiosity in Russian art, but that the price level at the auction
had been ``extremely high.''
   The artists get 60 percent of the sale price, the Soviet
Ministry of Culture receives 30 percent and Sotheby's gets 10
percent.

   Joy Baker, the wife of former White
House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, has checked into the Mayo
Clinic, said a hospital spokesman.
   ``She is a patient at Mayo, but because of our policy of patient
confidentiality we won't release any more information,'' said Mary
Ellen Landwehr, clinic spokeswoman.
   On July 1, Howard Baker stepped down as chief of staff and said
he would return to his home in East Tennessee where his wife and
stepmother were in poor health.
   Mrs. Baker, 59, the daughter of former Senate Minority Leader
Everett Dirksen, entered the clinic Wednesday, said Ms. Landwehr.
   She was discharged earlier Wednesday from St. Mary's Medical
Center in Knoxville, Tenn., where she was treated since June 9 for
chronic back problems.
   Mrs. Baker has been treated previously at the Mayo Clinic for
that ailment.
   Two years ago she had surgery on a non-malignant intestinal
obstruction, and in 1982 she had a tumor removed from her right
lung.

<TEXT>
   The 24-year-old son of former Green Bay
Packers quarterback Bart Starr had been dead up to four days before
his body was found by authorities summoned to the locked home by
his father, police said.
   The remains of Bret Michael Starr were unrecognizable, said
Hillsborough County sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa, adding that
it took authorities more than four hours Thursday to make a
positive identification.
   There were no signs of a struggle in the house or trauma to the
body, no bullet or stab wounds and no indication of foul play,
police said.
   The county medical examiner planned to conduct tests today to
determine how he died, said Jack Hall, forensic investigator. He
was unsure how soon results would be available.
   ``The place was locked up tight. The body was lying on the floor
in a dining area that opened into a back yard. It had been there an
estimated two to four days and the air conditioning was off,''
Espinosa said.
   Authorities gave no indication that drugs were involved, but the
elder Starr wrote about his son's drug problems in his
autobiography, ``My Life in Football: Starr.''
   ``Unbeknownst to us, by the time Bret graduated from high
school, he was well on his way to a cocaine addiction,'' the book
says, noting that the younger Starr had trouble dealing with his
father's fame.
   Starr went to see his son at his house in Carrollwood Thursday
morning but couldn't get in. Struck by a foul smell, he went for
help.
   Starr and a deputy who returned with him obtained a key from the
landlord but had difficulty entering the house because of two
Rottweiler dogs inside. They were removed by animal control
officers.
   Bret Starr moved to Tampa in late 1984 and was part owner of a
wholesale exotic fish and reptile importing company called Gulf
Coast Fisheries.

   Jesse Jackson says it would provide
balance to the Democratic presidential ticket if he were offered a
spot as Michael Dukakis' running mate.
   ``His ancestors came over on an immigrant ship. Mine came over
on a slave ship. That's balance,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson, who will go to the Democratic National Convention on
July 18 with more than 1,100 delegates, said he deserves to be
considered for the vice presidential nomination.
   ``There are several people under consideration, which is
appropriate, but then some one must be chosen based upon some known
standards. I want to know what those standards are and if I have
the best qualifications, obviously I should be selected. And if I
do not, I should not,'' he said.
   Jackson spoke at the Monumental Baptist Church in Memphis to
about 100 supporters, including two dozen of his convention
delegates.
   Jamillah Muhammad, southern regional co-ordinator for the
Jackson campaign, said the meeting was set up for state campaign
leaders from Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia who were
unable to attend an earlier gathering of their colleagues in
Washington, D.C.
   ``Most of the delegates wanted a chance to see him in a smaller
more intimate setting before the convention,'' she said.
   Jackson was leaving Memphis today and traveling to Dallas for a
meeting with Dukakis aides, his campaign said.
   Jackson described himself as a proven leader who has played a
major role in setting the party's agenda on social issues.
   ``The issue is not what do I want but what have I built,'' he
said. ``I've built a coalition of serious people throughout America
who want to make America better and keep America strong.''
   Noting that the Democratic party has never placed a black
candidate on the presidential ballot, Jackson told the delegates,
``We must break with tradition.''

   Water wasters in Grand Rapids, Mich., now can go to jail for 90
days, Oak Brook, Ill., residents have had their water cut off for
oversprinkling their lawns, and a switchboard in Columbus, Ohio, is
being bombarded with calls from people snitching on neighbors for
using too much water.
   Water police are on patrol in growing numbers as communities hit
by drought are resorting to desperate measures to conserve water.
Record heat in many areas is increasing the demand for water just
when supplies are running low.
   On Thursday, angry residents of Columbus flooded the city's
Water Division switchboard with calls accusing their neighbors of
violating the city's new ban on lawn sprinkling and filling
swimming pools. Officials hope the crackdown will reduce
consumption by about 50 million gallons a day, down from the
current average of 170 million.
   A Water Division spokeswoman said repeat violators of the ban
which took effect Thursday faced fines up to $100 and shutoff of
their water service.
   ``The biggest response we're seeing is people calling in
violators,'' said Jackie England, public information manager for
the Water Division. ``We're getting inundated by calls. We are
taking addresses and we are going to follow up.''
   She said 50 addresses were reported just half an hour after the
switchboard opened. ``The first call at 8:01 was a woman who had 20
addresses,'' she said.
   A Columbus radio station said its traffic reporter saw three
high schools sprinkling football fields and reported it to school
officials. The sprinkling quickly stopped.
   In Georgia, it's not the people but whole counties in trouble
over water.
   Gwinnett and Cobb counties, both suburbs of Atlanta, were each
fined $75,000 this week by the state Department of Natural
Resources for exceeding their June water allotments and told they
have to cut back.
   The counties protested that the limits were unreasonable because
their populations have grown, to a combined total of around
600,000, since the limits were set. State resources Commissioner J.
Leonard Ledbetter offered to take the counties to court if they
don't comply.
   Oak Brook, Ill., also has patrols on the lookout for people
sprinkling lawns when they shouldn't.
   Tom Lane, acting superintendent of public works in the Chicago
suburb of Oak Brook, said Thursday that 30 violators of the
community's restrictions on lawn sprinkling have had their water
shut off since limits were enacted by law June 18.
   ``We have public works and water department men on the street 24
hours a day, along with police'' to catch violators, said Lane. A
second violation prompts a water shutoff, and the price of getting
water turned back on is $200, he said.
   ``We have had several people (call) outraged'' about the
restrictions, Lane said. ``But we've got people calling on each
other now. They figure if they've been cited and cut off, why
shouldn't someone else?''
   Police Capt. Howard E. Rupard has traveled a beat in Lexington,
Ky., for 28 years watching for burglars, vandals and rowdies. Now,
he faces a new kind of criminal _ the water ordinance violator.
   ``I've had many, many other experiences,'' Rupard said, ``but
never with water.''
   It's been neighbor against neighbor in Lexington since the city
went on a water alert Friday. A judge can impose fines up to $250.
   Rupard and another officer recently found a fast food restaurant
still under construction that had a dozen sprinklers firing away.
   Representatives of the store said they hadn't heard of the
ordinance but wanted to comply. One problem was that the sprinklers
were automatically programmed. ``It took me 20 minutes to figure
out how to turn it off,'' said store manager Paul Marcinek.
   Grand Rapids, Mich., put extra-sharp teeth in its water
conservation law. Residents were put under a lawn sprinkling
restriction Thursday that could result in a 90-day jail term and a
$500 fine for violators.

<TEXT>
   About 200 handicapped people in
wheelchairs and on crutches demonstrated in downtown Seoul,
demanding the cancellation of the ``Paralympics,'' the special
Olympics for disabled athletes to be held in Seoul this year.
   ``Cancel the Paralympics,'' the disabled protesters shouted
Thursday as they tried to march into the streets. Hundreds of
helmeted riot police blocked the way.
   The protesters, many in wheelchairs and on crutches, punched at
police as they tried to break through the cordon. Police did not
react and just blocked the march by interlocking shields.
   The demonstrators said it is ``shameful'' for South Korea to
hold the special Olympics while failing to provide sufficient
welfare facilities for tens of thousands of the disabled in the
country.
   The ``Paralympics'' in Seoul are scheduled for Oct. 15-24. About
5,500 handicapped athletes from 60 countries, including the Soviet
Union and China, are expected to take part.
   Since their inception in 1960, the special Olympics have been
held every four years in the same country and during the same year
as the Summer Olympics except in the cases of the Mexico Olympics
in 1968 and the Moscow Olympics in 1980.

<HEAD>Number of Teacher Strikes Unchanged at 87, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group opposed to strikes by public employee
unions says there were just as many strikes staged by public school
teachers this year as last.
   The Public Service Research Foundation said Thursday while there
were the same 87 strikes in 14 states in 1987-88 as the year before
the situation had actually worsened because more teachers were
involved and almost three times as many students missed classes.
   It said 66,043 teachers went out on strike at some point during
the school year that just ended, and 945,793 students missed
classes.
   It said in 1986-87, there were 87 strikes in a dozen states,

<HEAD>Trial Begins for Navy Man Charged With Murder in Shipboard Robbery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYPORT NAVAL STATION, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a Navy petty
officer charged with murdering a disbursement officer during the
robbery of a $94,000 payroll says his client had plenty of money
and has been wrongly accused.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon, 34, had saved more than
$100,000 and was preparing to leave the service after 15 years, the
attorney, Lt. Matthew Michels, told a court-martial panel on
Thursday.
   However, prosecutors argued that Colon was followed by Navy
investigators to the bank where $87,000 in cash and 2,575 U.S.
Treasury checks were found in a safe deposit box rented in Colon's
name.
   Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, disbursing officer of the destroyer John
Hancock, was killed March 15 in a robbery of the warship's payroll.
   Colon, of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, faces the death penalty if he
is convicted of the murder charge. The Navy has not executed anyone
since an 1849 mutiny.

<HEAD>Governing Party Toasts Victory But Braces For End To Exclusive
Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexico's governing party was toasting victory
in the presidential elections even before the votes were counted,
but it also was bracing for an end to the exclusive power it has
wielded for six decades.
   ``It is the new political reality of the nation, and with which
we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful fashion,''
governing party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Thursday.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, went into
Wednesday's election squeezed between popular opposition candidates
on both its left and its right and persistent suspicions it would
cheat to stay in power.
   In the hours after the polls closed, the PRI-dominated Federal
Election Commission said its vote-counting computer was broken.
Opposition leaders said that meant the PRI had not done as well as
it had hoped.
   ``We have achieved this victory in one of the most contested
elections in our history and one of the most peaceful,'' Salinas de
Gortari told thousands of cheering supporters at party headquarters
Thursday.
   But Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the leftist coaltion, said
it was too soon to call any of the races. He and other opposition
leaders accused the PRI of vote-rigging, and he warned the election
commission not to tailor the results to PRI's victory claim.
   More than 38 million people were registered to vote.
   Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett, head of the election
commission, said Thursday that official results will be released on
Sunday. In the long wait, the parties were trying to assess their
showings.
   It was clear that at least some segments of the governing party
were bracing for a bigger bow to democracy than they had bargained
for with all the talk of clean elections and democratization.
   ``Information allows us to see that the opposition groups show a
majority force in several districts of the country,'' Salinas said,
in an apparent concession that PRI had lost some congressional
seats.
   He said the ``legal victories'' of the opposition would be
respected.
   Salinas seemed to be preparing the party faithful for what could
be a pivotal moment in PRI history _ less than overwhelming victory
at all levels.
   No PRI presidential candidate has ever won with less than 70
percent of the vote and it has never given up a governor's race. It
lost only one Senate seat since 1929 _ and that was to a candidate
whose coalition included PRI.
   Sources inside the PRI and in opposition camps were saying
Cardenas might even win the federal district, a sprawling area
including Mexico City that is home to a quarter of the nation's 80
million people.
   Six decades of uninterrupted power has given PRI the reputation
of a party that stoops to voter manipulation, election fraud and
intimidation. The opposition made honest elections the main
campaign issue.
   The slaying of a top strategist for the leftist opposition only
days before the election and reports of fraud on election day did
little to dampen the allegations.
   The Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a citizens'
watchdog group, reported 1,100 cases of balloting irregularities,
including 500 in the Mexican capital alone.
   Opposition spokesmen said Thursday that some complaints had been
filed with local and federal election officials and documentation
was still being gathered on many cases.
   The erosion of PRI's influence in a time of economic crisis and
growing demands for democratization was evident in the strong
campaigns waged by Cardenas and Manuel J. Clouthier of the rightist
National Action Party.
   Privately, Salinas' inner circle was admitting its doomsday
scenario included giving up one or two spots in the 64-seat Senate
and taking the presidency with a smaller margin than any president
in party history.
   ``We are viewing it with serenity,'' one aide said, agreeing to
meet with foreign reporters only on condition of anonymity.
   Although the president dominates the political system in Mexico
and PRI's majority in the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies is not at
risk, anything more than a figurehead role for the opposition would
be a dramatic change.
   Aides said that Salinas' constant campaign talk about holding a
clean election laid the groundwork for such an eventuality.
   Cardenas, Clouthier and Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the small,
radical Revolutionary Workers Party met with federal officials
Wednesday night and issued a statement accusing the government of
rigging the election.
   The statement accused the government of stuffing ballot boxes,
eliminating citizens from voting rolls, paying people to vote and
multiple voting.
   ``The Mexican political system is corrupt and lacks
credibility,'' Clouthier told a news conference Thursday.
   PRI representatives called the fraud allegations a publicity
move and challenged the opposition to prove its allegations.
   President Miguel de la Madrid, whose six-year term expires Dec.
1, was quoted in the government newspaper El Nacional Thursday as
saying the voting showed the world that Mexico is capable of
holding a clean election.

   A Japanese submarine participating in naval
maneuvers lost a confrontation with a fishing buoy off Pearl Harbor
and had to be freed by U.S. Navy divers, a Navy spokesman said.
   No one was injured Thursday when the submarine Takeshio's left
stern diving plane became tangled in a cable holding a fish
aggregating buoy 10 miles south of Pearl Harbor, according to U.S.
Navy spokesman Petty Officer Brent Johnston.
   The 236-foot Takeshio, which was submerged at the time, suffered
no damage, Johnston said. The sub was able to surface, but remained
stuck until divers freed it about six hours later, he said.
   The Takeshio carries a crew of 80, according to ``Jane's
Fighting Ships.''
   A U.S. Navy diving team cut the sub loose from the buoy cable,
and the Takeshio returned to Pearl Harbor under its own power,
Johnston said.
   The diesel-powered Takeshio wass in Hawaiian waters
participating in RIMPAC 88. The United States, Australia and Canada
are also taking part in RIMPAC, short for ``Rim of the Pacific.''

   Officials in Soweto said they
plan electrical blackouts to counter a two-year boycott of rent and
service payments by residents of the country's largest black
township.
   Local officials switched off power for several hours Wednesday
evening to three sections of Soweto. The action forced postponement
of a professional soccer game, put out street lights and prompted
some police and fire stations to operate on emergency generators.
   On Thursday officials said they planned more blackouts.
   ``Unless residents pay their bills we will continue with the
blackouts,'' said R.E. du Toit, chief electrical officer for
Soweto, the main township outside Johannesburg.
   The blackouts effect all residents in the targeted areas, not
just those participating in the boycott.
   ``It is unfortunate that those who pay their rent, water and
electricity will suffer as much as those who do not,'' du Toit said.
   The Soweto City Council has threatened to cut off electricity to
the entire township in two months unless residents resume paying
rent and service fees.
   An estimated 80 percent of the township's 2.5 million residents
are participating in the boycott that begain in 1986. The Soweto
City Council is $40 million in debt and no longer can afford to
purchase electricity, du Toit said.
   The boycotts were launched to protest poor services,
dissatisfaction with township officials and a host of political
grievances. The black township officials were elected in polls that
drew only 10-20 percent of voters, and they are widely viewed by
blacks as collaborators with the white-dominated national
government.
   The level of black political violence has fallen from the
turbulent period of 1984-6, but widespread civil disobedience
remains in townships such as Soweto.
   In addition to the rent boycott, most high school students in
Soweto are staying away from classes this week to protest the
detention of student activists. The boycott was called by the
Soweto Students Congress and coincided with a return to school
after the mid-year holidays.
   Local officials appear helpless to end the rent boycott, despite
repeated pleas. There have been some evictions but most residents
immediately move back into their homes.
   Du Toit said that one section of the township had its
electricity shut off in May, but there has been no increase in
payments.
   Some township residents say local activists have intimidated
them into not paying rent, adding that they fear retribution from
members of the community more than they fear eviction or the loss
of services.
   Most houses in Soweto have electric lights, although many
township residents use coal for cooking and heating.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Madame Chiang Kai-shek, one of the most
influential women in Chinese history, made a rare public appearance
today to bid farewell to her aging Nationalist Party comrades who
will soon retire.
   The nearly 1,200 delegates attending the morning session of the
ruling party's 13th congress gave Madame Chiang an emotional
standing ovation as she stepped onto the stage at the Chung Shan
Building in the hills of suburban Taipei.
   Wearing a white traditional Chinese gown covered by a black
vest, Madame Chiang walked slowly with a cane as a bodyguard and
nurse accompanied her. Government publications say she was born in
1901 but local newspapers report she is at least 90.
   ``How are you, comrades?'' she said in a strong voice before
asking party secretary-general Lee Huan to read her 15-minute
statement.
   The strong-willed second wife of Chiang Kai-shek wielded power
that was considered second only to her husband's when he led the
Nationalist government on the Chinese mainland and, after losing a
civil war to the Communists in 1949, in exile on Taiwan.
   Madame Chiang left Taiwan for a mansion on Long Island in New
York soon after her husband died in 1975 but returned in 1986 to
attend ceremonies marking his 100th birthday.
   She since has lived in seclusion at her estate in the Taipei
suburb of Shihlin, leading to intense speculation she was trying to
influence Taiwan's future from behind the scenes.
   In her statement today, Madame Chiang urged the Nationalist
Party, or Kuomintang, to use Taiwan as ``a starting point to rescue
our 1 billion compatriots on the mainland.''
   The Nationalists still claim to be the rightful ruler of all
China, and Madame Chiang attacked Taiwanese who seek to declare the
island a separate nation.
   Invoking the names of her husband and of Sun Yat-sen, who
founded the party 94 years ago, Madame Chiang told the congress
delegates not to forget the party's ``glorious history.''
   ``We are facing a critical moment as our senior members are
retiring and are succeeded by the new blood,'' she said, adding
that the old guard's ``contribution to the party and the state
should never be ignored.''
   Many of the elderly members, who theoretically represent
districts on the mainland, are retiring.
   The senior party members led Taiwan to economic prosperity
during the past 40 years but generally have viewed with concern the
democratic change introduced by her late stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo,
who eased authoritarian one-party rule.
   ``We should make innovations without forgetting the past and
move ahead without forgetting our roots,'' Madame Chiang's
statement said. ``The development of our party rests on the
observance of discipline and the introduction of younger people
with integrity.''
   Madame Chiang, her black hair tied back, waved a white
handkerchief to acknowledge the applause of congress delegates.
Newly elected party chairman Lee Teng-hui approached her and they
shook hands.
   Local media reported that Madame Chiang participated in an
unsuccessful last-ditch effort to block Lee's appointment as acting
party secretary after Chiang Ching-kuo's death in January. But she
was quoted this week as saying Lee, a native Taiwanese, was the
best man to be party leader.
   Political observers in Taiwan generally view Madame Chiang, who
attended the congress as chairman of the party's Central Advisory
Committee, as maintaining strong influence over the elderly
Nationalists loyal to her husband.
   Wellesley-educated Madame Chiang was adviser, confidante,
amabassador and English interpreter to her husband and was
sometimes called ``the brains of China.'' She once headed the
Chinese air force.
   Her eldest sister, Ai-ling, married H.H. Kung, later a
Nationalist Chinese premier and governor of China's central bank.
Sister Ching-ling married Sun, who died in 1925, and eventually
split ideologically with the rest of the family by remaining in
China after the civil war and taking a post equivalent to vice
president in the Communist government.

   A hand grenade exploded at a
singing contest, killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding 50 other
people, mostly children, police said today.
   A constabulary report from southern Basilan province said most
of the injured were children watching the contest in the town plaza
of Isabela, the provincial capital, late Thursday.
   Investigators said the grenade was hurled from the back of the
stage onto the crowd below. No suspects have been arrested in the
incident, which occurred on the eve of Isabela's annual feastday.
   Renegade members of the Moro National Liberation Front, a Moslem
rebel group demanding autonomy in the southern Philippines, are
known to operate in the area and have been blamed for attacks on
nearby towns in the past months.
   Basilan is located 18 miles south of here and about 560 miles
from Manila.

   The parents of a 10-year-old girl killed
in a fiery church bus crash say they have offered to give up a
settlement from Ford Motor Co. if the automaker agrees to recall
and modify its older school buses.
   ``If someone was ever injured or killed in a similar accident,
and we hadn't done everything we could to prevent it from happening
again, we couldn't live with ourselves,'' said James Nunnallee,
whose daughter, Patricia, died May 14 with 26 others on the
Radcliff Assembly of God church bus.
   ``People might think we're crazy, but it doesn't bother us.''
   Nunnallee, an Air Force major, and his wife, Karolyn, said
recently they would accept a $1 settlement if Ford agreed to the
recall and to revamp the gas tanks on thousands of its older buses.
   When the church's bus was struck by an allegedly drunken driver
heading the wrong way on Interstate 71, the gas tank was punctured,
and smoke from the ensuing fire that spread rapidly through the bus
was blamed for all 27 deaths.
   Sixty-four of the 67 families whose relatives were killed or
injured in the accident have accepted the out-of-court settlements
jointly offered by Ford, which manufactured the bus' chassis, and
Sheller Globe Corp., which made the bus' body.
   Ford representatives have agreed to meet with the Nunnallees to
discuss the recall proposal, the couple's lawyer said.
   Robert Waite, a spokesman for the company, said Thursday Ford
has been considering the possibility of a recall since the crash
occurred. ``There may be an action taken _ it's under active
consideration here,'' he said.
   The bus was one of the last made in the United States before a
1977 federal rule took effect, requiring manufacturers to start
protecting their fuel tanks from the impact of crashes.
   Michael Hance, the Nunnallees' lawyer, said his clients have
asked Ford to replace the tank on each old bus, install a cage
around the existing tank or remount each tank inside the chassis,
where it would be shielded by the frame.
   But the company, which has disclaimed responsibility for the
accident, is concerned that performing the repairs might give
owners ``a false sense of security,'' Waite said.
   ``We don't want people to think you can magically make a
20-year-old bus brand new,'' he said.
   Lawyers familiar with the case have told The Courier-Journal
that the settlements by Ford include payments of $63,000 apiece to
families of children who suffered minor injuries and $700,000 to
the estates of each of the 24 children who died.

   Ralph Ferrara tried passing off his live bobcat
as a dead ocelot to throw authorities off the scent. But when Daisy
growled, the jig was up.
   Ferrara had tried his best, a spokesman for the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday. First, he
flatly denied that a bobcat shared his three-room New York City
apartment.
   Then he tried to dodge ASPCA officers by allowing how he once
had an ocelot that died. He displayed a cremation certificate and a
sympathy card from the Long Island Ocelot Club.
   But the cat-and-mouse game came to an end when Daisy started
growling.
   ``They look under the dining room table, and under the dining
room table, under a piece of cloth, is the bobcat,'' recounted the
spokesman, Jeffrey Hon. ``The bobcat weighs 30 pounds and is
seemingly very vicious.''
   The officers, alerted Wednesday by a neighbor's complaint of a
wild animal in the Queens building, had found their prey. Their
next step was obvious, Hon said.
   ``They take refuge in the bedroom.''
   The encounter was not all that unusual for the ASPCA, which
enforces animal cruelty laws in the city. ``At least once a year we
get a really weird case,'' said Hon. ``We had a lion out in Staten
Island once. Somebody had it living in their garage.''
   This time it was Daisy, a healthy 5-year-old female bobcat,
declawed but ``very, very fast,'' said Hon. ``It could jump you if
it wanted to.'' Its lair was Ferrara's Long Island City apartment,
decorated with porcelain cat heads and stocked with cat-related
videos.
   ``The guy's really into cats,'' said Hon.
   Ferrara said Daisy was a gift from friends and he didn't know it
was illegal to keep a wild animal as a pet in New York. He said
Daisy stayed at home, was paper trained, ate cat food and chicken
gizzards and occasionally even paid attention to him.
   ``She's a feline. She will do some things that I tell her. Other
commands she will acknowledge but will only react to them if she
feels like it,'' he said. ``She had the run of the place.''
   Friendly? ``To me, yes.''
   To ASPCA officers, apparently not. They summoned police, who
arrived an hour later and shot Daisy with two tranquilizer darts.
Freed from their bedroom retreat, the ASPCA officers confiscated
the cat and gave Ferrara a ticket for keeping a wild animal as a
pet. They're holding Daisy while they seek an appropriate home.

   President Lee Teng-hui today was elected
chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party, a move that strengthens
his mandate to lead this prosperous island after four decades of
Chiang Kai-shek family rule.
   Lee, 65, is the first native Taiwanese to lead the party, which
was formed 94 years ago on the Chinese mainland and still claims to
be the legitimate ruler of all China.
   The Chiang family matriarch, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, made a rare
public appearance at the 13th party congress that chose Lee. She
urged delegates not to forget the contribution of old-guard members
facing retirement as a reform-minded younger generation seeks power.
   Madame Chiang, at least 86 years old, walked slowly as
bodyguards and a nurse followed.She received warm applause from the
delegates and shook hands with Lee.
   All but eight of the 1,184 delegates attending the congress of
the Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang, stood up to
support Lee's nomination.
   Jaw Shau-kong, a young Nationalist lawmaker, remained seated to
protest the decision not to elect the chairman by ballot.
   The congress is the first in which delegates were not handpicked
by top party officials and in which a Central Committee election
was not restricted to candidates proposed by the party leader.
   The session comes at a time of increasing political
liberalization in Taiwan, a nation slowly emerging from its
authoritarian past.
   The selection of Lee, acting party chief since January, is the
first of several crucial personnel moves to be made during and
immediately after the weeklong congress that began Thursday.
   New faces are expected in the party's policy-making Central
Standing Committee and the Cabinet as old guard party
conservatives, who fled the Chinese mainland to Taiwan in 1949 with
Nationalist strongman Chiang Kai-shek, step down.
   Meanwhile, China's Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang sent
congratulations to Lee today, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   It quoted a message as saying: ``I sincerely hope that our two
parties will, together with the people of the whole country, make
joint efforts to strive for an early realization of the great cause
of the reunification of China.''
   Lee became president and acting party chairman after the Jan. 13
death of Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek, ended four
decades of family rule on Taiwan.
   Under the Kuomintang's authoritarian rule, Taiwan developed into
an export-fueled economic powerhouse. Chiang Ching-kuo in his final
years also introduced democratic change by lifting martial law and
allowing opposition political parties.
   Lee has vowed to continue the democratic trend and also supports
reforming the state-dominated financial system.
   Polls have shown Lee to be immensely popular. Native Taiwanese,
ethnic Chinese whose families settled in Taiwan before 1949,
account for about 85 percent of the island's nearly 20 million
people.
   Lee's popularity and his efforts to avoid alienating
conservatives have helped increase his influence.
   Lee was born Jan. 15, 1923, in Japanese-occupied Taiwan. His
ancestral home in Sanchih village is a spacious red-brick
Chinese-style building in the middle of a rice field.
   The local media have given Lee favorable coverage, portraying
him as a model youth and diligent student. At age 42, Lee left his
teaching post at a Taiwan university to study in the United States,
where he earned a doctorate from Cornell University.
   He has published several works on agriculture and economics,
including one with the weighty title, ``Intersectoral Capital Flows
in the Economic Development of Taiwan.''
   Lee is a pious Christian who is married with two daughters. The
local media say he is an excellent golfer who also plays the violin
and enjoys Beethoven. He also is a keen student of Japanese
fencing, known as Kendo.
   ``It was a miracle,'' prominent writer Po Yang recently said of
Lee's rise to power. He described Lee as ``the first leader with a
happy family and a healthy mind in China's 5,000-year history.''

<HEAD>Many 1990 Goals For Infant, Maternal Health Not Being Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's infants and mothers will not have
the survival rates in 1990 that health officials hoped for a decade
ago, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control.
   Of the 13 top-priority goals concerning pregnancy and infant
health in the government's 1990 health objectives for the nation,
only three are likely to be met, the CDC said Thursday.
   ``It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. Ann Koontz,
a specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administration
in Rockville, Md. ``This indicates that we have some significant
problems relating to maternal and infant health.''
   The CDC, using National Center for Health Statistics data,
projects that the nation's infant mortality rate _ infants dying
before age 1 _ will be 9.1 per 1,000 live births.
   That's a drop from the 10.6 rate in 1985, but still short of the
9.0 rate in the 1990 objectives, which were published in 1979.
   Based on earlier data from 1970-81, health officials had
projected a 1990 infant mortality rate of 7.8, but ``the decline in
the infant mortality rate has slowed,'' the CDC said.
   The reasons, Ms. Koontz said, are not known for certain: ``It's
a very complex field. We'd all like to see improvements, but
there's not been a simple solution.''
   Another objective was that no racial or ethnic group should have
an infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1,000. Among black
Americans, the rate stood at 18.2 in 1985 and is projected to
decline only to 15.9 by 1990, the CDC said.
   The infant mortality rate among whites stood at 9.3 per 1,000 in
1985 and is projected to fall to 7.9 by 1990, the CDC said.
   Economics may play a part in the discrepancy between the
mortality rates for blacks and whites. ``We know that poor economic
circumstances are distributed disproportionately among minority
populations,'' Ms. Koontz said.
   But the complete reason is not clear, she said, noting that
previous studies have shown that among college-educated mothers,
black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate of
comparable white infants.
   Among the other goals not likely to be met:
   _No county, racial or ethnic group should have a maternal death
rate above five per 100,000 live births. The 1990 national rate is
projected at 7.0, with black mothers at 20.5.
   _No more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 5.5
pounds. The 1990 projection: 6.7 percent.
   _No more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county, racial
or ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first three
months of pregnancy. The 1990 national projection: 23.6 percent,
38.5 percent for blacks.
   One of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nation's
neonatal mortality rate _ babies dying in the first 28 days of
life. That rate is projected to be 5.7 per 1,000 in 1990, below the
target of 6.5.
   Two other goals are considered likely to be met: having most
babies leave the hospital in car safety seats, and putting into
place programs to screen newborns for metabolic disorders.
   A 1987 survey found safety-seat use at hospitals of 75 percent,
and all states now have such metabolic screening programs, the CDC
said.

   Iran today urged everyone who can carry a
gun to report for duty on the war front with Iraq. Earlier, a
senior Iranian official demanded that the United States pay
compensation for shooting down a civilian jetliner and killing all
290 people aboard.
   The call to arms was issued by the newly formed General Command.
   ``At a time when arrogance is brandishing its teeth and claws at
our nation, at a time when the United States is carrying out
aggressive actions in the Persian Gulf...
   ``The General Command sincerely demands that the nation should
fill the fronts with fresh and trained forces,'' the General
Command said, calling on ``all persons who can carry a gun'' to
report to military bases.
   The statement, the most sweeping mobilization call to be issued
in recent months, was carried by Tehran radio and by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   In recent battles Iraq has recaptured the Majnoon islands, the
Faw peninsula and other chunks of Iranian-occupied Iraqi territory
east of Basra.
   The Airbus jet was downed by U.S., not Iraqi forces, but Iranian
leaders have constantly accused Washington of backing Baghdad in
the nearly 8-year-old war. The phrasing of the mobilization call
implied it was aimed at defending Iran from both U.S. and Iraqi
attack.
   Washington has said the jetliner was shot down when the crew of
the USS Vincennes mistook it for an F-14.
   On Thursday, Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam
reiterated Iranian threats of a ``blow'' against the United States
in retaliation for the jetliner attack.
   ``They are responsible for all political and legal debts,
including compensation,'' Sheikholeslam said Thursday in a speech
on Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in a
report made available today.
   ``Until there is a blow in response to the blow they have dealt
us, the issue is not closed. The time, place and form of the blow
will be our decision, in order to give us the advantage of
surprise.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday that ``humane and moral'' considerations will figure
heavily in any decision on compensation.
   ``I suspect that doing what we think is right will be the
deciding factor,'' he said.
   Sheikholeslam claimed that U.S. military authorities gave
permission to shoot down the jetliner in advance and that the
United States had planned a ``show of force'' to ``provide
justification for their presence in the region.''
   In the same radio broadcast, Iran Air Managing Director Mohammad
Reza Majidi said less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only
150 identified. He said the plane's ``black box'' data recorder had
not been recovered.
   Of the 290 people on the jet, 66 were children. There were 38
foreigners aboard.
   Earlier Thursday, pall-bearers carried 76 flag-draped coffins
through Tehran's streets as thousands of mourners shouted their
anger at the United States.
   ``No compromise! No surrender! Fight with America!'' shouted
waves of marchers, who carried wreaths, anti-American posters and
golden-framed photographs of the victims.
   Aside from the funeral procession, foreign reporters who arrived
in Tehran the past two days have found little evidence of rage.
   Life in the capital, half-empty during Iraqi missile attacks
earlier this year, is once again busy and congested with traffic.
The sprawling bazaar and all shops are open.
   ``Everybody is saddened, sure,'' said an Iranian merchant who
expressed the views of several others interviewed at random. ``But
we have really become used to tragic blows. And people are too busy
to cope with their day-to-day problems, inflation, shortages and so
on.''
   But even pro-Western Iranians found it hard to understand how
the Vincennes, carrying sophisticated electronic equiment, could
mistake an airliner for a hostile F-14.
   ``It's a terrible blunder,'' said another Iranian, a physician
who was trained in the West. ``Americans seem to be too much under
the influence of `Rambo' films.''

<TEXT>
   Navy experts were examining radio
telemetry data today in an effort to learn why a Trident 2
submarine missile went off course and had to be destroyed 60
seconds after it lifted off on a test flight.
   The failure was only the second for the Trident 2 in 13 test
launchings from a land pad here. The weapon, able to carry 10
nuclear warheads, will be the most powerful in the Navy's arsenal
when it becomes operational late next year.
   The $23.7 million three-stage missile vaulted skyward Thursday
evening and darted quickly into a heavy cloud layer.
   The Navy reported 20 minutes after liftoff that there had been a
malfunction. A statement later said the Trident 2 had developed a
problem during first stage flight and that the range safety officer
sent a radio signal that ignited explosive packages in the missile.
   Debris from the shattered rocket fell harmlessly into the ocean
several miles down the Atlantic tracking range to the southeast of
here.
   The Navy said the cause of the problem could not be determined
immediately and that an investigation was underway.
   The 44-foot Trident 2 was to have hurled a dummy warhead package
to an ocean target several thousand miles to the southeast. The
weapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles, but the intended range
Thursday night was not disclosed.
   The test was the 13th of 20 land-pad launches planned here, to
be followed by at least five submarine firings. The missile is
scheduled to become operational late in 1989 and will be deployed
initially aboard the new submarine USS Tennessee, the first of nine
Trident subs planned by the Navy.
   Each submarine will hold 24 Trident 2s, each of which will be
able to deliver up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets.
   The Trident 2 test launch program began here in January 1987 and
logged nine straight successes before suffering its first failure
last January. Two more successes followed prior to Thursday night's
failure.

   The United States will not process any Soviet
immigrants until Oct. 1 because a huge surge in refugees has
exhausted government funds, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said today.
   Armenians, who were the hardest hit by the move, criticized the
decision.
   Embassy spokeswoman Marguerite Squire said the United States
would continue to accept applications from Soviets wishing to
resettle in the United States, but on Monday embassy officials
began postponing the last step in approval of the applications,
pre-departure interviews.
   She said the government has run out of funds for the refugees'
housing, food, clothing and transportation. The cutback is to last
until a new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   The restrictions affect any Soviet applying to the embassy for
political asylum in the United States, but they affect Armenians
most of all.
   Last month, the embassy issued a record 2,063 immigration visas,
94 percent of which were for Armenians. The figures do not include
most Soviet Jews, who generally leave the Soviet Union on Israeli
visas and get U.S. visas in Western Europe.
   ``We are ready to start a new life in a new country and what
happens?'' would-be immigrant Mushegh Sarafyan said today.
``Already they are deceiving us.''
   Sarafyan was among about 50 Armenian men, women and children
huddled on a street next to the embassy under overcast skies. They
said they had received permission from the Soviet government to
emigrate to join relatives in Los Angeles, but that American
diplomats told them of the delay this week.
   They accused the U.S. government of being insensitive and
questioned whether budgetary contraints are the real reason for the
new restrictions.
   ``America is such a rich country. Why can't it afford to take in
70 families?'' Sarafyan said. He said American diplomats had told
70 Armenian families who applied for immigration within the past
few months to show up this week at the embassy for the
pre-departure interviews. But now the families have been left out
in the cold.
   ``We moved out of our apartments, our homes, we sold our clothes
and quit our jobs, and now we are left practically on the street,''
he said.
   Sarafyan said the would-be emigres had expected to leave the
Soviet Union this week after completing American paperwork and have
no place to stay in Moscow until October.
   ``The U.S. Embassy should have given us at least a month. This
way they told us nothing. Who is responsible? No one is helping
us,'' he said.
   Ms. Squire and other American diplomats refused comment on the
Armenians' complaints and said any response would have to come from
Washington.
   From last Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 of this year, the embassy expects
to grant 9,500 Soviets, mostly Armenians, permission to resettle in
the United States. From Oct. 1, 1986, to Sept. 30, 1987, 1,800
immigration requests were approved.
   The sharp rise is a result of a recent easing of Soviet
emigration restrictions under Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
was planning a mission to rescue American hostages in Beirut before
he was abducted by pro-Iranian forces, a PLO official was quoted as
saying today.
   The rescue plan was disclosed in a transcript of Higgins'
interrogation by his captors, Bassam Abu Sharif, a Palestine
Liberation Organization spokesman, was quoted as saying in the
Beirut daily Ad-Diyar.
   ``We have seen a transcript of the interrogation of Higgins,''
he was quoted as saying.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was chief of a 76-member observer
group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he was
kidnapped near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed responsibility for
Higgins' abduction, charging he was a CIA spy.
   The United States and the U.N organization have denied the
charge.
   ``We know from seeing the transcript of the interrogation of
Higgins ... that he was preparing a large-scale operation under the
slogan of rescuing all the American hostages (in Lebanon),'' Abu
Sharif was quoted as saying in the newspaper, which is based in
Christian east Beirut.
   Abu Sharif did not say how the PLO obtained the purported
transcript.
   He also was quoted as saying that Higgins ``had headed the
operations department of the U.S. Delta Force and had arrived in
Lebanon wearing (the U.N.'s) Blue Beret.''
   The Delta Force is better known as the Rapid Deployment Force, a
U.S. group set up to act against terrorism and other threats to
American interests.
   He also said the ousting from Beirut of guerrillas loyal to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat's was part of a ``Syrian-American plan.''
   Arafat's loyalists Friday left the refugee camp of Bourj
el-Barajneh, their last stronghold in Beirut, after it fell to
Syrian-backed PLO dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising
faction.
   Eighteen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. The longest held is 40-year-old Terry A.
Anderson of Lorain, Ohio.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by factions loyal to
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iranian Shiite group.

   A 24-year-old Englishman fell from a
building to his death today as the week-long San Fermin Festival of
drink, dance and bulls entered its third day in this northern city,
police said.
   In an incident unrelated to the daily morning bull run, Roy S.
Sofer of London died after falling from the fourth floor of a
central Pamplona building, which he had reached by climbing up a
water pipe on its facade, police said.
   Police said friends of Sofer told them he had been trying to win
a bet over who could climb highest. Sofer was dead on arrival at a
local hospital, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The festival attracts an estimated 200,000 tourists from around
the world and across the country, doubling the city's normal
population, according to city officials.
   The second running of the bulls today resulted in slight
injuries to 13 people who tested their mettle running ahead of
them, police said.
   Most of the injured in the bull run received on-the-spot
treatment for bruises and scratches, but two required brief
treatment at the city's Navarre Hospital, police said.
   The bulls ran the half-mile stretch from the corrals to the bull
ring in 3 minutes and 20 seconds, with more than a thousand people
running ahead of them. Professional matadors kill the bulls each
afternoon in bullfights.
   The festival in honor of San Fermin, Pamplona's patron saint,
has been held continously since 1591. Ernest Hemingway described it
in his 1926 novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''
   Since 1591, bulls have gored 52 people to death, 12 since 1924,
according to official records.

   Australia's wild rabbit population now
exceeds 200 million, or about 13 rabbits per citizen, the
government-funded Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
said today.
   Noel Flavell, an economist with the bureau, said the rabbit
population was booming because the myxomatosis virus, which had cut
down the rabbit population since it was introduced 30 years ago,
has become less effective.
   The rabbit costs Australia around $55 million in lost
agricultural production, according to a bureau report.
   Flavel said the mortality rate of myxomatosis infected rabbits
had dropped from 99 percent to around 60 percent in recent years.
   Officials are looking into developing a new lethal gene to
further reduce the wild rabbit population, he said.
   Australia's population is about 15.4 million.

   Penny Bancroft adopted two kittens a few
weeks ago, but it's her dog, Buttercup, that's taken over nursing
them.
   Buttercup, a 3-year-old poodle and cockapoo mix, has been
nursing and cleaning her adopted kittens for about four weeks.
   ``I was going to have her fixed, but it's like God meant it to
be,'' Ms. Bancroft said this week.
   Ms. Bancroft rescued the kittens, which she named Puss and
Boots, when she found them almost dead because their mother refused
to nurse them. She took them to a veterinary hospital, where they
were rubbed back to life.
   For five days, Ms. Bancroft's family fed Puss and Boots every
two hours. On the sixth day, Buttercup, who had been caring for and
licking the white and gold kittens, began producing milk for them.
   Ms. Bancroft said she and her family hadn't planned to have cats
as pets, but added, ``We can't give up on them now.''
   The kittens, who were bottle-fed to supplement the dog's milk,
are now eating baby food.
   Buttercup hasn't given birth to puppies for about a year and a
half and guards the kittens as if they were her own, Ms. Bancroft
said.

   When mechanic Brian Pelletier began to
check out a customer's car to see what was wrong with the air
conditioning, he found a 3{-foot-long boa constrictor behind the
dashboard.
   ``I was laying right there on the floor, unscrewed the dash, and
all of a sudden I looked over and six inches from my head there was
this snake,'' said Pelletier, 45, an auto mechanic for 25 years.
``I was going to retire in three years, but I think this will move
it up.''
   A crowd of nearly two dozen mechanics, sales people and police
officers surrounded the car Wednesday, but were reluctant to move
on the reptile. After two hours, the snake finally was extracted by
former Peabody dog officer Nancy Kiley and William Ramsey, a game
warden with the state Environmental Police.
   Ramsey said he was not sure whether the snake crawled into the
car in Massachusetts or if it accompanied the vehicle from Detroit.
A lump in the snake's belly indicated it had recently eaten
something.
   ``They eat about once a month, so it could have come from
Detroit,'' said Ramsey, who said boas prefer cool places.
   ``How it got in there, no one knows, but he was in there a
while,'' he said. ``He was all tangled up in the wires, and they
usually don't get into corners like that.''
   Ramsey took home the snake, which he named Lester, and plans to
turn it over to the state Division of Wildlife and Fisheries for
placement with a new owner.
   ``All I want is the car back,'' said Frank Luongo, whose
daughter, Jessie, purchased it. ``I hope there are no babies in
there.''

   Iraq said its warplanes attacked three
``maritime targets'' in the Persian Gulf, and shipping executives
said today that two supertankers were set ablaze in the raid.
   The gulf-based executives said the Iranians had chartered the
two vessels to shuttle oil from the key Kharg Island oil terminal
at the head of the waterway to the export terminal in the Strait of
Hormuz.
   They identified the tankers as the 264,108-ton Fellowship L and
the Cypriot 215,780-ton Star Ray. The Fellowship L flies the
Liberian flag but is owned by a Greek company.
   Both tankers were attacked in the vicinity of Kharg, said the
executives. They spoke on condition they not be named. No
casualties were reported.
   The executives also said they believed another Greek vessel on
charter to the Iranians might also have been hit.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors maritime traffic around the world, said the bridge and
crew quarters of each vessel were set on fire in the attacks.
   It said the Fellowship L, managed by Ceres Hellenic Shipping
Ltd. of Piraeus, was raided Thursday night when it was 30 miles
into its southbound trip after loading at Kharg.
   The tanker was hit once before, in February 1985.
   In a statement quoted by state-run Baghdad radio, an Iraqi
military spokesman reported the raids Thursday.
   The raids were carried out ``in continuation of our course to
destroy the Iranian regime's oil resources, which it exploits for
aggression,'' said the spokesman in the radio broadcast.
   He said two of the targets were ``large'' and one was ``very
large.''
   Iraq has used the term maritime target to refer to vessels,
mainly tankers, sailing to and from Iranian ports. It has been
attacking them since early 1984 as part of a blockade to throttle
the oil-based Iranian economy.
   The aim of the blockade has been to force the government of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to accept a negotiated peace in the war
between the two gulf oil powers. The war began in September 1980.
   Iran has been retaliating on a ship-for-ship basis in the
``tanker war,'' in which the London-based Lloyd's Shipping
Intelligence Unit estimates that 540 commercial vessels have been
attacked.
   Lloyd's said 88 of those attacks occurred in the first six
months of this year alone.
   The tanker war is fought in bursts, usually sparked by the Iraqi
strikes. The last two Iraqi strikes were on July 1, when the
supertankers Fortune Ship L, a sistership of the latest victim, and
Khark 4 which is Iranian, were struck and set ablaze.
   Because Iraq has had no ports in operation since the outbreak of
the war, Iran selects targets for its retaliatory strikes from
among neutral commercial vessels, especially those sailing to and
from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. and other naval task forces that patrol the waterway, have

U.S. warships also expanded their protective mantle in early May to
non-U.S. flagged vessels if attacked in their vicinity.

   A leader of the Writers Guild of
America predicted that stalled negotiations between producers and
striking writers would resume soon following union ratification of
an interim contract.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the WGA West, said he hopes
to meet with the chief negotiator for the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers, the industry's bargaining group.
   ``I am hopeful that we can continue to explore ways of resolving
the impasse and that we can do so quickly,'' Walton said Thursday.
``The pressure is on both sides to get the industry working again.''
   Walton's optimism reflected a change in the tense environment
that has surrounded the strike since it began March 7.
   Union members voting in New York and Los Angeles Wednesday night
approved an interim contract with independent producers by an 8-1
margin. The interim contracts are a union effort to split the
industry's ranks.
   Thirteen companies have already signed the new deal, including
Carolco Pictures, makers of the ``Rambo'' movies, and actress
Shelly Duvall's Platypus Productions Inc., union officials said.
   Walton said that he and J. Nicholas Counter III, negotiator for
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, met
through the night Tuesday with talks concluding Wednesday.
   The Alliance has said it is not in negotiations with the WGA and
that its last contract offer to the guild, rejected by the WGA by a
3-1 margin June 22, is final. But Walton said he believed
Wednesday's vote would lead to talks that could end the 18-week
strike that has idled most Hollywood production.
   Referring to the interim contract, Walton said, ``It is now
clear that the writers' guild has a contract that can put the town
back to work. It is fair, reasonable and works for both sides. The
obstacle to ending the strike, therefore, is not obviously the
writers' guild.''
   Walton predicted the new interim agreement, in conjunction with
a previously approved independent contract, would mean that between
300 and 500 writers would resume work in coming weeks.
   As of Thursday, 124 production companies, mostly small
operations, had broken ranks.
   The two sides in the strike remain divided on payments for
television reruns and foreign television syndication.

   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar arrived in Norway today to head a high-level meeting on how
the United Nations can respond to environmental threats without
stunting world development.
   The heads of 25 specialized U.N. agencies and economic
commissions are to meet Saturday and Sunday at a closed-door
session called by Norway's Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.
Mrs. Brundtland headed the U.N.-sponsored World Commission on
Environment and Development and drafted a landmark report called
``Our Common Future.''
   ``The intention of this meeting is to get the U.N. system to
give higher priority to environmental issues,'' said Morten
Wetland, a special advisor to Mrs. Brundtland on foreign and
environmental affairs.
   Among the issues to be raised at the conference are
deforestation, land degradation and desertification, acidification,
loss of biological diversity, and air and water pollution.
   Also scheduled to attend are the head of the World Bank, Barber
B. Conable Jr.; Michel Camdessus, chairman of the International
Monetary Fund; and the heads of the World Health Organization, the
International Atomic Energy Commission, the U.N.Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
   The conference was being held amid growing awareness of
potential environmental disasters, from the depletion of the
atmosphere's ozone layer protecting the earth from harmful
radiation, to the gradual warming of the earth due to the
entrapment of gases, the so-called ``greenhouse effect.''
   ``Everybody is conscious of the importance of the environment,''
Perez de Cuellar said Thursday on a stopover in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Perez de Cuellar was meeting privately in Oslo today with Mrs.
Brundtland, Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg and King Olav V.

   The dollar rose in active late-morning trading in
Europe today despite reports of dollar-selling by the West German
central bank.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers in West Germany said the Deutsche Bundesbank was selling
dollars, which pressured the currency. But the dollar later bounced
back.
   One trader with a major Italian commercial bank argued that this
underlined the dollar's recent resilience and the market's
basically bullish stance on the American currency.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.33 yen to a closing 131.97. But later, in
London, it was quoted higher at 132.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates:
   _1.8219 West German marks, up from 1.8161
   _1.5148 Swiss francs, up from 1.5100
   _6.1288 French francs, up from 6.1140
   _2.0514 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0440
   _1,350.25 Italian lire, up from 1,346.50
   _1.2058 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7105 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7180 Thursday.
   Bullion dealers said they were waiting for the release later
today of the June U.S. unemployment report, which they said would
give them some indication of inflationary pressures in the U.S.
economy.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $439.20 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $438.90. Both were down from Thursday's late
bid of $440.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $438.90, down from $441.00 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.09 to close at a bid $441.59.
   Silver was quoted in London toda at a bid price of $6.94 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $6.98.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Pass Resolutions Condemning Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Episcopal Church leaders have approved a
resolution calling abortion ``a tragic dimension'' that should only
be used in unusual cases such as incest, rape or if the pregnancy
endangers the mother's life.
   The church's House of Bishops passed the resolution by voice
vote Thursday, and continued discussions on homosexuality, the role
of female bishops and an economic package to help the poor.
   ``The mood of our culture swings toward accepting abortion,''
said the Rt. Rev. Craig B. Anderson, bishop of the diocese of South
Dakota. ``The church is saying, `Hey, wait a minute, let's
acknowledge that life is sacred.'''
   ``We acknowledge in this country that it is the legal right of
every woman to have a medically safe abortion,'' the resolution
said. ``This church emphatically opposes abortion as a means of
birth control, family planning, sex selection or for any reason of
mere convenience.''
   ``This is an attempt by the church to reach out with compassion
on both sides and not to close off dialogue,'' said the Rt. Rev.
Donald J. Davis, bishop of northwestern Pennsylvania.
   The statement now must be considered by the House of Deputies.
   Church leaders, meeting in Detroit through Monday, hold a
General Convention every three years.
   During debate Thursday, members decided further study of the
homosexuality issue would be necessary.
   ``I believe we have given signals all over this church that we
are very divided,'' said South Carolina Bishop FitzSimons Allison.
   The church also upheld a controversial resolution that would
permit a congregation in a diocese with a female bishop to call in
a visiting male bishop to officiate at sacraments.
   Opponents attacked the vote in the House of Delegates as
discriminatory to women and a questioning of their right to
ordination.
   Also Thursday, Mayor Coleman Young urged church leaders to pass
an economic package that would assist poor people in beleaguered
cities such as Detroit. They plan to vote on the economic package
later this week.
   Young told leaders that Detroit has the country's highest
unemployment rate, 20 percent, prompting mass migration from the
city.
   ``No city in the country has experienced the wholesale
abandonment that Detroit has. We have the same borders as we did in
1950, but half the population,'' the mayor said.
   The economic package, dubbed the Michigan Proposal, has been
passed by the House of Deputies of the bicameral convention and now
goes before the House of Bishops.
   The proposal, written by H. Coleman McGehee, bishop of the
diocese of Michigan, calls for $250,000 to be allotted by the
national Episcopal Church in a bid to raise $4 million for six
years through foundation grants and other denominations to aid
areas in economic crisis nationwide.
   If passed, the resolution would establish cooperative housing
and employee owned businesses and develop community credit unions
as well as offering aid to the poor.

<TEXT>
   A meeting on budget cuts turned into an airing of
political differences among Contra leaders as the Nicaraguan rebel
movement drastically trimmed its scope due to the U.S. aid cutoff
by Congress.
   A Contra leader speaking at a news conference Thursday to
discuss non-military budget cuts accused dissidents within the
movement of ``giving ammunition to the Sandinistas.''
   Resistance directors Alfredo Cesar and Aristides Sanchez
reportedly support Contra military commander Col. Enrique Bermudez,
whom dissidents accuse of corruption and close links to ousted
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
   ``There is no doubt that the divisions, the lack of unity in the
movement, is giving ammunition to the Sandinistas,'' said Sanchez,
who complained that the declarations of dissident commanders were
showing up in the Nicaraguan press.
   ``Dissidence is a sacred right in all organizations that believe
in democracy,'' Cesar said. ``But not when it begins to damage the
Nicaraguan Resistance struggle against the Sandinistas.''
   On the budget cuts, Cesar and Sanchez said non-military spending
has been slashed by 42 percent and 130 of 320 employees worldwide
have been laid off. The long-anticipated cuts in political and
administrative staff will close some offices in Europe and Latin
America.
   Cesar denied this month's round of layoffs were politically
motivated but conceded politics ``was one of the priorities'' in
deciding whom to let go.
   The cuts will save about $250,000 on the monthly budget of close
to $700,000, said Cesar, emphasizing the cuts ``have nothing to do
with operations in the field.''
   At least some of those laid off had aided the dissidents,
including the Contra's Miami spokeswoman Marta Sacasa. Cesar said
Ms. Sacasa would be given a new position as head of public
relations for the directors.
   But asked later if she would assume that position, Ms. Sacasa
laughed and said, ``I doubt it.'' She said she expected to be gone
within a few weeks.
   Cesar and Sanchez strongly denied a New York Times report that
each Contra leader receives $75,000 a year in U.S. funds and a
monthly expense account.
   ``The directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance do not receive any
salary from the United States government,'' said Sanchez.
   Contra leaders also repeated their refusal to resume peace
negotiations with the Sandinistas until they agree to put President
Daniel Ortega at the head of their delegation, move the talks out
of Nicaragua and get better guarantees from Central American
presidents that Ortega will fulfill any agreement.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and Indonesia's foreign minister said today that
peace talks on Cambodia would go on, despite Vietnam's hints it
won't participate.
   ``I am ready to go to Jakarta on the 25th of July with my
partners of the coalition,'' Sihanouk said after meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz. ``We will be there.''
   A State Department spokesman said Shultz gave Sihanouk a letter
from President Reagan repeating U.S. positions that Sihanouk has a
central role in a Cambodian settlement and that the Khmer Rouge
should be shunned. It said the United States will continue to
pressure Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia.
   Reagan's letter invited Sihanouk to visit Washington this year.
   Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who is organizing the
talks, said they were still on.
   ``There is no intention to recast the terms of the meeting,'' he
told reporters when asked about Vietnam's charges that Indonesia
and its allies were trying to turn the informal talks into
negotiations between Vietnam and the Cambodian resistance.
   Sihanouk and Alatas were in Bangkok for an annual meeting of
foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or
ASEAN, and counterparts from Japan and several Western nations.
Shultz is attending the meeting as part of nine-country tour of
Asia.
   Vietnam's Foreign Ministry issued a statement Thursday saying
the ASEAN ministers' joint communique issued this week prolonged
the 9-year-old deadlock on the conflict and undermined the
Indonesia talks. The communique voiced strong support for the
Cambodian resistance.
   The statement said ``such a hostile communique released by the
ASEAN countries heralds their negative stance'' at the talks. With
such a stance, the talks ``will not bring about expected results,''
it said.
   The statement was carried by the official Vietnam News Agency,
monitored today in Bangkok.
   Sihanouk heads a coalition of resistance groups fighting the
Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh. The coalition includes
the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people
during its 1975-78 rule.
   Vietnam ousted the regime and set up a new government in 1979.
It has promised to withdraw 50,000 soldiers from Cambodia this year
and the other 50,000 by 1990.
   Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge wants to retake power in Cambodia.
He said it was not possible to disarm the group because China, its
main source of weapons, was not in favor of that.
   He favors forming a national army comprising the three guerrilla
groups and the government.
   ``If the Khmer Rouge were a member of the quadripartite
organization, then I think they would not be able to exploit the
situation,'' he said.
   On Thursday, Shultz said the United States is ``unalterably
opposed'' to the Khmer Rouge reclaiming power.
   ASEAN members include Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
   The Vietnamese statement said the foreign ministers deliberately
repeated a stance that has ``caused confrontation between Southeast
Asian countries'' and ``resulted in the deadlock to the (Cambodia)
issue over the past nine years.''
   It said the group was trying to protect the Khmer Rouge, and
ignored the fact that the pro-Hanoi government has control over the
country.

   The indepedent counsel investigating Edwin
Meese III concluded he could have prosecuted the attorney general
on two felony charges, but decided not to, National Public Radio
said today.
   The network, citing unnamed sources, said the office of the
independent counsel, James McKay, had informed Meese's lawyers that
McKay felt he could ``technically'' file charges in connection with
the attorney general's ownership of $14,000 in telephone company
stock.
   McKay is known to have investigated a possible conflict of
interest in connection with Meese's ownership of the stock in
regional ``Baby Bell'' companies at the same time he was meeting
with the heads of regional telephone companies to discuss legal
restrictions on the companies.
   NPR said it could not learn why McKay declined to press charges.
Nor, the network reported, could it be learned how McKay
characterized the matter in the report he filed this week with a
federal court on his 14-month investigation of Meese.
   Both McKay's office and James Rocap, Meese's lawyer, refused to
discuss the matter, NPR said.
   McKay's office filed an 830-page report earlier this week on his
criminal investigation of Meese. The report is under a court
secrecy order, but Meese said he had been vindicated by the fact
that McKay concluded his investigation without seeking indictment.
   Meese, who announced Tuesday that he was resigning effective in
late July or early August, says he isn't leaving the Justice
Department in a state of disarray, even though top posts are filled
with replacements who have only been on the job a month or two.
   ``We have one of the finest management teams of any department
in the government,'' Meese said Thursday in an interview. He said
the new nominees ``certainly bring all kinds of experience'' and
that ``there will be no leadership gap'' with his own departure,
scheduled for late July or early August.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, meanwhile, said the
White House is moving ``as rapidly as possible'' to find a Meese
successor. But ``it's not the end of the world'' if the search goes
beyond the convention recess for Congress, he said. The Democrats
meet in Atlanta July 18.
   One of the new arrivals at the Justice Department is Deputy
Attorney General Harold Christensen, who was a civil lawyer in Utah
before arriving in Washington last month. He still faces Senate
confirmation hearings late this month.
   Associate Attorney General Francis Keating and criminal division
head Edward Dennis also face confirmation hearings then.
   Dennis, who took his new post in June, is a former U.S.
attorney, while Keating, who came aboard in May, has been an
assistant Treasury Department secretary.
   Christensen and Dennis are replacing former Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld,
who resigned in protest March 29 over Meese's continued tenure at
the Justice Department. Keating is replacing Stephen Trott, who is
now a federal appeals court judge.
   ``We have people in all the positions, we have an ongoing
program, we have success,'' said Meese. ``There's no disarray and
there will be no leadership gap.''
   A going-away party was held Thursday for another key department
official, Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper, head of the
Office of Legal Counsel.
   Meese has recommended that President Reagan nominate Douglas
Kmiec, a deputy in OLC, to replace Cooper.
   In the interview, Meese also said that:
   _He intends to seek payment of his legal fees from the public
for the just-completed 14-month criminal investigation by McKay. On
his 1987 financial disclosure form issued this week, Meese
estimated those fees for the first 7{ months of the investigation
at $100,000 to $250,000.
   _``Members of Congress ought to stick to legislation and not try
to run the departments. ... I think that would improve the
relationship considerably'' between Congress and the executive
branch.
   _He would have handled his role in connection with
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. differently if he had known at the
time ``that this was a gang of crooks.''
   His reference to ``crooks'' apparently was directed at four
former Wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges
and are cooperating in the government's prosecution of Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., and other politicians and businessmen in the
Wedtech scandal.
   _As attorney general, he has lived up to the promise he made 3{
years ago to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would avoid the
appearance of a conflict of interest or even a situation in which
someone might unfairly interpret something as a conflict of
interest.

   Norwegian authorities issued a pollution
alert because of oil floating from the burned-out Piper Alpha rig
in the North Sea, an official said today.
   But the oil slicks from the striken Piper Alpha rig in the
British sector of the North Sea were breaking up and were not
expected to reach the coast of western Norway, said Erik Nygaard of
the State Anti-Pollution Agency.
   A Norwegian plane was being sent to observe and assess the
dangers, he said.
   ``The information we've got indicates that the slicks are being
broken down by the water and that the addition of new oil is small.
If this is correct, it's unlikely that the oil slick will drift
towards the Norwegian coast,'' Nygaard said on the national NRK
radio.
   A British surveillance plane reported one oil slick six miles
long and 1.2 miles wide near the oil rig, but it was considerably
smaller than on Thursday. Another smaller slick was observed 18
miles away from the rig, the agency said.
   It said the main slick would have to be 20 times larger to be a
threat to Norway.
   An explosion Wednesday night broke the rig apart, and 166 people
were believed killed.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today said that Cambodia's resistance leader, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, is central to a political solution in Cambodia, and he
gave Sihanouk a letter of support from President Reagan.
   Reagan invited Sihanouk to visit Washington, possibly this fall,
said State Department spokesman Charles Redman. The former
Cambodian leader once branded the United States as Cambodia's No. 1
enemy.
   Shultz and Sihanouk met for 40 minutes to discuss the threat of
the Khmer Rouge guerrillas returning to power in Cambodia, the
withdrawal of Vietnamase troops from that country and talks among
the warring sides in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   After meeting with Shultz, Sihanouk said he was ready to go to
Jakarta with the partners of his resistance coalition for talks
July 25 with Cambodian and North Vietnamese government officials.
   The resistance partners include the Khmer Rouge, which
brutalized Cambodia after taking power in 1975 until it was ousted
in a 1978 Vietnamese invasion. According to some estimates, up to 3
million Cambodians died during Khmer Rouge rule.
   Redman said Shultz reaffirmed that the United States found a
Khmer Rouge return to power totally unacceptable.
   In remarks to reporters after the meeting, Sihanouk said the
Khmer Rouge aimed to retake power. He said disarming the
Chinese-supported guerrillas would be difficult.
   Shultz and Sihanouk met as part of a three-day ``dialogue''
between the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
six close partners _ the United States, Canada, New Zealand,
Australia, Japan and the European Community.
   Although some ASEAN countries are hoping the United States plays
a more direct role in Indochina, Washington's position has been to
follow the Southeast Asian organization's lead.
   ``We believe the United States has a key role to play in
underwriting a solution to the Cambodian problem,'' Foreign
Minister Suppiah Dhanabalan of Singapore told Shultz and the six
ASEAN ministers. He praised the United States for playing ``an
indispensable role'' in maintaining stability in the region.
   Shultz signed an agreement under which the United States will
provide an additional $5 million to assist Thai villagers living
along the embattled borders with Cambodia and Laos.
   The U.S. Embassy said the funds will assist about 300,000 people
in 412 border villages.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda of Thailand presented Shultz
with the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant, a high-level
royal decoration first issued by Rama IV in 1861.
   Shultz leaves Thailand on Saturday for an eight-country swing
through Asia and the Pacific. He holds talks with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia before flying on to Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital, the same day.

   A Palestinian youth visiting jailed relatives
in the Gaza Strip stabbed four Israeli jailers today and seriously
wounded three of them before being arrested, a prison spokesman
said.
   Soldiers arrested the 17-year-old after a chase outside the Gaza
Central Prison, said Johnny Tester, the prison spokesman. He said
the assailant's brother is a prison inmate. Tester and Israel radio
said the assailant is believed to be a member of the underground
fundamentalist group Islamic Jihad.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troops wounded two youths in a
clash with Palestinian demonstrators who hurled rocks and bottles
in the city's open-air market, hospital officials and Palestinian
witnesses said.
   Police and soldiers closed Jerusalem to Palestinians from the
occupied territories to prevent violent protests called for by
underground leaders during Moslem prayers at the city's Al Aqsa
mosque.
   The leaders called for a ``day of confrontation'' at the mosque,
one of the holiest sites of Islam, and police poured hundreds of
reinforcements into Jerusalem, doubling the city's normal police
force.
   Since the uprising broke out Dec. 8 in the territories Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war, 215 Palestinians and four
Israelis have been killed.
   Ilana Ziv, a spokeswoman at Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon, said
two of the jailers hurt in the prison attack were rushed to the
hospital by helicopter, and one was in serious condition with stab
wounds to the heart. Israel radio said two others were taken to Tel
Aviv's Tel Hashomer Hospital, where one was in moderate condition
and the other lightly wounded.
   The radio said the assailant carried two knives and the attack
appeared to have been plotted in advance.
   The army said it was investigating.
   In Nablus, Palestinians heeded a general strike called for by
underground Islamic fundamentalist leaders. Arabs in the city
blocked roads with rocks, burned tires and ordered merchants to
close their shops, Palestinian reporters said.
   Israeli troops opened fire on the protesters, wounding
17-year-old Saed Atallah in the right thigh and Mohammed Abdul
Karim, 22, in the right leg, Al Ittihad Hospital officials said.
The army said it was investigating.
   Observance of the strike was viewed as a test of strength among
rival Palestinian groups vying for leadership in the occupied
territories.
   Two groups identifying themselves as the United National
Leadership of the Uprising issued conflicting leaflets. One called
for a weeklong general strike beginning today, while the other
ordered two days of strikes on Saturday and Sunday.
   The Islamic fundamentalists also issued a leaflet calling for a
weeklong strike beginning today.
   In Bethlehem and Ramallah, demonstrators threatened shopkeepers
who opened their stores. One witness in Ramallah said he heard
masked youths telling merchants: ``Close, you dogs, or we will burn
you down.''
   In Gaza City, transportation and commerce were halted.
Palestinian youths burned tires, set up roadblocks and hung dozens
of outlawed Palestinian flags from electricity poles, Palestinian
reports said.
   The army today erected roadblocks at the entrances to Jerusalem
barring Palestinians from entering the city.
   An Associated Press reporter saw four roadblocks on a four-mile
stretch of road between the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem
and the southern outskirts of Jerusalem.
   On one roadblock, security forces hung a sign which said in
Arabic: ``It is forbidden to enter Jerusalem.'' Troops turned back
all West Bank cars and hundreds of vehicles were backed up at the
checkpoints.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said hundreds of extra police were on
duty to maintain order in Jerusalem.
   Undergound leaders of the Palestinian uprising, which entered
its eighth month today, ordered Palestinians to ``observe holy Al
Aqsa day ... by striking painful blows at the occupation forces.''
   Al Aqsa, on the Temple Mount, is the third holiest site in
Islam. The area also abuts the Wailing Wall, the last remnant of a
temple holy to Jews.

   An overpass collapsed at an airport in Sichuan
province in southwestern China, killing two workers and injuring
14, an official report said today.
   Four hours after the collapse Thursday at a construction site at
the Jiangbei International Airport in Chongqing, rescue workers
still searched for two people believed buried under the rubble, the
Xinhua News Agency said.
   The overpass collapsed when 10 beams, each two yards wide and 30
yards long, fell after bridge supports were dismantled, the report
said. It did not elaborate.
   The 14 injured were taken to the hospital, but the report gave
no details about their injuries.
   Authorities said the collapse caused about $135,000 worth of
damage.

   Britain announced today it has signed a huge arms
contract with Saudi Arabia, including the sale of warplanes and
``specialized navy vessels.''
   The Defense Ministry refused to give details of the contract,
but official sources said it meant Britain had supplanted the
United States as the major arms supplier to the oil-rich kingdom.
   The new deal followed a $7.5 billion contract won by Britain in
1986 to supply Saudi Arabia with 72 Tornado jet fighters and other
aircraft.
   A Defense Ministry announcement said the agreement, signed
Sunday, ``will provide for a significant enhancement of the
existing defense capabilities'' of Saudi Arabia.
   It said the deal involved ``additional aircraft, a construction
program, and specialized navy vessels.''
   ``This agreement is a major achievement of immense benefit for
both countries,'' the statement said.
   The Washington Post, quoting U.S. congressional and
administration sources, said the total deal could be worth nearly
$30 billion.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, said the contract
was the biggest ever signed by Britain.
   The agency said the deal was worth ``more than seven billion
pounds,'' or $12 billion, and included the sale of 30 more Tornado
aircraft, mine sweepers and the construction of two Tornado bases,
extra weapons systems, spares and technical support.
   The deal is the first big Saudi arms contract announced since
news broke this year of a previously secret sale by China to Saudi
Arabia of Silkworm missiles.

<HEAD>Dutch Reformed Church Questions Presence in Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Dutch Reformed
Church, the church of most government officials, have questioned
the ethical grounds for keeping South African troops in Angola.
   ``These are the questions in the hearts of our people,'' said
the church's moderator, Johan Heyns.
   ``While the government may have its reasons for maintaining a
military presence in Angola, parents of national servicemen are
entitled to ask whether this is necessary.''
   He was commenting Thursday on an editorial in the church's
newsletter this week in which editor Fritz Gaum asked if the
government would not be acting ethically if it withdrew its troops
from Angola.
   Gaum said South Africa could become more deeply involved in a
struggle on foreign soil, with a corresponding increase in loss of
life.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan responded by saying the editorial
appeared to ignore South Africa's national security interests.
   The military acknowledged for the first time in November that
its forces were maintaining a long-term presence in Angola and were
fighting Cuban soldiers and forces of the Marxist government. South
Africa supports the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola guerrillas.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church seldom criticizes
government policy. Last year, it reversed decades of church policy,
declaring the policy of apartheid a sin and not supported by the
Bible. But the church has not criticized specific apartheid laws.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Colorado Man Released From Cambodia After 14 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colorado man detained since May 1987
for illegally entering communist Cambodia has been freed, and a
U.S. Embassy official said today that the man soon will return to
the United States.
   Sterling Brian Bono, 35, had been detained since he crossed into
Cambodia from eastern Thailand. He was released and flew to Bangkok
on Thursday after his brother flew to Cambodia to pick him up.
   Bono, of Las Animas, Colo., will return to the United States
shortly, said the spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Ross
Petzing.
   Bono told reporters in Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh last
week that he was searching for his son in a refugee camp when he
wandered across the border and was captured by soldiers. He said he
served with a U.S. Army engineering unit in Soc Trang, Vietnam,
during the Vietnam War.
   Efforts to secure Bono's release were hindered by the lack of
diplomatic relations between the United States and the Cambodian
government. The United States has not recognized the government
that Vietnam installed after a 1978 invasion.
   Negotiations were handled by the Phnom Penh office of the
Swiss-based International Committee of the Red Cross.
   It had appeared the Cambodians were using the Bono affair to
extract some form of U.S. recognition, but they recently announced
Bono was free to go. No reason for the release was given.
   ``We are pleased to report that Mr. Bono has already arrived
safely in Bangkok,'' Petzing said. ``We hope we can now move ahead
as well with the repatriation of the remains of American servicemen
lost in Cambodia during the Indochina war.''
   A total of 83 American servicemen are listed as missing in
Cambodia.
   On June 20, David Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, told a congressional task
force there was no progress on the remains in Cambodia.
   He said: ``Despite our interventions through the Vietnamese, the
Lao, and the ICRC (and) direct communications by the National
League of Families, the Vietnamese-installed regime in Phnom Penh
has refused to cooperate in returning these remains to the U.S.''

<HEAD>Delaware Attorney General Tells Children's Hospital to Rescind
AIDS Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware children's hospital must
rescind its controversial policy of not treating patients with the
AIDS virus or face legal action, the state's attorney general said.
   Charles M. Oberly III said Thursday the policy violates
Delaware's public accommodations law.
   ``We've said emphatically that unless they rescind the policy
immediately we will take whatever action that is necessary, whether
it be through the courts or through the state Human Relations
Commission,'' he said.
   The attorney general's order was contained in a letter sent
Wednesday to officials of the Alfred I. du Pont Institute, a $150
million, 90-bed pediatric hospital in Rockland, just north of
Wilmington.
   So far, hospital administrators have not responded to Oberly's
letter.
   The attorney general's order was the latest development in a
growing controversy sparked two weeks ago by the announcement of a
policy that all prospective patients would be tested for exposure
to the human immunodeficiency virus, and those who tested positive
would be sent elsewhere.
   Amid a storm of criticism, hospital officials later said they
might agree to care for children in extreme cases, but the policy
did not define an extreme case.
   Earlier this week, about a dozen doctors from the Children's
Hospital of Philadephi in response to a plea from top Delaware
health officials angered by the policy.
   ``Its our belief that a hospital, to some extent, is subject to
the public accommodations sections of the state law,'' Oberly said.
``They just aren't free to discriminate against who can come in and
who can go out of their institution. ...
   ``I disdain the idea that AIDS patients are becoming the lepers
of the 20th century,'' Oberly said. ``I think we have to be a
little more compassionate.''

   About 50 Moslem youth demonstrated
outside the U.S. Embassy today on the eve of a visit by U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz. They were protesting the downing
of an Iranian civilian airliner by a U.S. warship.
   They carried placards and banners proclaiming ``Death to
America'' and ``Reagan Blood Sucker'' and handed embassy guards an
unsigned letter addressed to U.S. Ambassador John Monjo.
   Embassy officials said the letter supported a Foreign Ministry
statement earlier this week criticizing the downing of the plane.
   The Iran Airbus A300 was shot down Sunday while the guided
missile cruiser USS Vincennes was engaged with Iranian gunboats in
the Persian Gulf. Iran said 290 people were killed.
   The letter said the downing of the plane was to provoke Iran so
that the United States could justify an invasion of Iran, embassy
officials said. It also said the United States forces should
withdraw from the Persian Gulf, officials said.

<HEAD>Bundy Vows to Fight Death Sentence to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Condemned killer Ted Bundy's lawyers vowed to
fight to the Supreme Court if necessary to contest a federal
appeals court ruling upholding his death sentence for the murder of
a 12-year-old Florida girl.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which stayed Bundy's
execution just seven hours before it was to be carried out in
November, agreed with a lower court that none of Bundy's claims had
merit.
   Bundy has also been convicted of killing two women in Florida
and is a suspect in at least 10 other slayings.
   One of Bundy's attorneys, Polly Nelson, said lawyers will either
ask for a rehearing before all 12 judges of the 11th Circuit or
appeal Thursday's decision by a three-judge panel to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``The state is very pleased that the federal appeals court has
found no merit in this defendant's claims. We are hopeful that the
process of seeing that justice is served can now continue,'' said
Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth.
   Bundy is also under death sentence for killing two sorority
sisters in Tallahassee, Fla., three weeks before 12-year-old
Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake City, Fla., was abducted. The 11th
Circuit has stayed that death sentence, ordering a lower court to
review the appeal, which Ms. Nelson said involves issues similar to
the Leach case.
   Bundy had challenged his conviction in the Leach case by
claiming he was incompetent to stand trial, had been denied his
choice of attorneys and had ineffective assistance of counsel.
   Thursday's 60-page decision said Bundy had presented a ``cogent,
well-reasoned argument'' to the trial judge, and he had a
``rational understanding of the proceedings.''
   ``Consequently, a `hard look' at the record evidence supports
the conclusion that Bundy was competent to stand trial,'' Circuit
Judge Frank Johnson wrote.
   Bundy was an escapee from a Colorado jail, where he was being
held on murder charges, when the Florida murders were committed. He
is also a suspect in seven to nine slayings dating back to 1974 in
Seattle, three disappearances and two slayings in Utah and one
murder and three disappearances in Colorado.

<TEXT>
   Crew members of the spy ship USS Pueblo suffer
from lingering emotional as well as physical wounds from their
capture by the North Koreans 20 years ago, says the organizer of a
crew reunion.
   At least 50 of the 83 men aboard the ill-fated vessel plan to
attend the four-day reunion beginning today, said Bob Chicca of
Bonita, Calif., the get-together's organizer who was a Marine staff
sergeant aboard the ship.
   The Jan. 23, 1968, capture of the Pueblo in waters off North
Korea proved an embarrassing episode for President Lyndon Johnson.
   One crew member was killed during a brief skirmish in which the
Pueblo was struck by gunfire but didn't fire a single shot. The
ship was armed with only an on-deck cannon, two .50-caliber machine
guns and assorted hand-held weapons.
   North Korea seized the vessel and hundreds of documents
detailing how the United States conducted seagoing espionage. The
crew was imprisoned for 11 months.
   Some men are dogged by physical problems caused by malnutrition
and beatings, and others suffer from psychological problems, some
serious, said Chicca, who was wounded in the seizure.
   ``Talking about it is like therapy for me,'' said Chicca, 44,
one of two Marine Corps intelligence analysts aboard the Pueblo.
``You realize you're not alone, and others have the same problems
you have.''
   During the reunion, the men will be the guests of honor at
graduation ceremonies at the Naval Training Center and will visit
the center's Prisoner of War museum.
   The ship's commander, Lloyd M. Bucher, who lives in nearby
Poway, will attend the get-together.
   Debate continues over whether Bucher should have surrendered the
ship without a fight, while some hold the government culpable for
leaving the lightly armed spy ship unprotected.
   After 11 months of captivity, the prisoners were finally freed
on Dec. 23, 1969, after the United States issued a statement
apologizing for ``grave acts'' committed by the ship against North
Korea. However, a statement disavowing the confession was read both
before and after the statement.
   Bucher said disappointment, rather than bitterness, describes
his feelings about the incident.
   ``Disappointment that no naval forces came to my aid even though
I was promised protection before starting the mission in Japan,''
he said.
   Chicca said there was a public outcry when a Navy court of
inquiry recommended Bucher be court-martialed. No action was taken.
   ``The Navy is still polarized,'' Chicca said. ``Either they want
to praise Cmdr. Bucher or they want to kill him.''

   The odds of a catastrophic earthquake
that could kill thousands of people in Southern California are
higher than once believed, and the San Francisco Bay area faces a
similar threat, a federal report says.
   Recent concern about the so-called ``big one'' on the San
Andreas Fault has centered on the greater Los Angeles-San
Bernardino area because so much strain on the fault's north end was
released by San Francisco's great quake of 1906, which measured an
estimated 8.3 on the Richter scale.
   But a report issued Thursday by the U.S. Geological Survey and a
working group of its National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation
Council said the San Francisco Bay area is nearly as likely to
suffer a major quake.
   ``Unless we aggressively pursue earthquake reduction measures,
there is the potential for many people to die, perhaps more people
than ever died in a single day from any (natural) disaster in the
United States,'' said Richard Andrews, deputy director of
California's Office of Emergency Services.
   A 1983 state emergency plan said a great quake near metropolitan
Los Angeles would be America's worst disaster since the Civil War.
   Two separate studies, one being published today in the journal
Science, say that quakes along the San Andreas in the Mojave region
near Los Angeles tend historically to occur in bursts of two or
three within a relatively short time, followed by 200- to 300-year
periods without large temblors.
   By demonstrating such clustering, both studies suggest the
Mojave segment may be in a quiet period, with another major quake
unlikely for 70 years or more.
   The new Geological Survey report, however, said there is a 50
percent chance in 30 years and a 20 percent chance within the next
decade that a major quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale will
rupture the northern San Andreas or Hayward faults, which border
the west and east sides of San Francisco Bay.
   In Southern California, the report said, there is a 60 percent
probability within 30 years and a 20 percent chance within 10 years
that a great quake measuring 8.0 or a major quake registering 7.5
will rupture two or three segments of the San Andreas Fault.
   Many scientists said previously that Southern California faces a
50 percent chance of a great quake in 30 to 50 years.
   The odds of a 7.5-magnitude quake in Southern California rise to
70 percent within 30 years if only one of the three segments
breaks, but scientists don't expect that kind of fault behavior,
the federal report said.
   Chances are less than 10 percent in 30 years for an exact repeat
of San Francisco's 8.3-magnitude 1906 disaster, which recent
studies show killed at least 3,000 people.
   A 1980 Federal Emergency Management Agency report said a repeat
of the 1906 quake could kill 3,000 to 11,000 people, hospitalize
12,000 to 44,000, and cause $38 billion in damage. It said a 7.4
jolt on the Hayward fault could kill 3,000 to 7,000 people,
hospitalize 13,000 to 27,000, and cause $44 billion in damage.
   The disaster agency also said an 8.3-magnitude quake in Southern
California could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people, hospitalize 12,000 to
55,000, and cause $17 billion in damage.
   The Geological Survey report also listed chances of 50 percent
in 30 years for quakes measuring 6.5 on the Imperial Fault and 6.5
to 7.0 on the San Jacinto Fault, which runs near the burgeoning San
Bernardino-Riverside area.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number, say from 5.5 to 6.5
magnitude, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A magnitude of 8 is considered a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<TEXT>
   Iran's acting commander in chief, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said today his nation will not seek revenge against the
United States for shooting down an Iranian jetliner and killing all
290 people aboard.
   Iran's air force chief said U.S. systems must have been able to
monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the Iran Air
jetliner and the airport control tower. Brig. Gen. Mansour Satari
said the missile attack showed that the U.S. military was ``unable
... to control its sophisticated systems.''
   The cruiser USS Vincennes shot down the jetliner on Sunday.
American officials said the European-built Airbus was mistaken for
an attacking Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Satari told foreign reporters Thursday that the destruction of
the plane was an ``intentional and unprovoked attack.''
   But he later qualified this by saying the U.S. military
``accepted on purpose'' the risk of shooting down civilian planes
because they were unable to control their sophisticated systems.
   Satari said Iran had ``all the tapes needed'' to prove that
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down.
   He also said the plane was traveling in ``the center of the
international air corridor'' between Bandar Abbas and Dubai and
could have deviated 10 miles either side and still have been within
the corridor.
   In a prayer congregation, Rafsanjani said ``the United States is
trying to push us to commit the same crime ... but if we did that,
the world would turn against us.
   ``That is why we do not push to take revenge. Wise people
understand why we do not take revenge.''
   He spoke after the newly formed General Command issued a
statement calling on ``all persons who can carry a gun'' to report
for duty on the war front.
   The remarks by Rafsanjani, who is also Parliament speaker,
signaled that Tehran may have decided on restraint in the wake of
the incident, Western diplomatic sources said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The crowd chanted ``Death to America!'' and ``War, War Until
Victory!'' The audience included young ``basij'' or volunteers in
red headbands, and a few wounded war veterans.
   In the United Arab Emirates, a newspaper reported today that
Iran Air will take a circuitous route from the southern Iran city
of Bandar Abbas to Dubai until the direct one becomes safe for
civilian air traffic.
   The new route is aimed at avoiding the corridor used by the
Airbus on Sunday, said the report published in the Dubai-based
English-language newspaper Khaleej Times.
   The paper quoted unidentified Iranian sources in Bandar Abbas as
saying the new route takes the aircraft to Shiraz, about 300 miles
to the east. It then doubles back to Dubai, adding 32 minutes to
the previously 28-minute flight.
   Iran Air officials in Abu Dhabi and in the neighboring port of
Dubai refused comment on the report.
   The General Command, in a statement carried by Tehran radio and
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, said it ``sincerely
demands that the nation should fill the fronts with fresh and
trained forces.''
   It was not the first general mobilization call, but it was the
most sweeping to be issued in recent months and it followed several
major battlefield defeats for Iran.
   Although the Airbus jet was downed by U.S., not Iraqi forces,
Iranian leaders have constantly accused Washington of backing
Baghdad in the nearly 8-year-old war. The phrasing of the
mobilization call implied it was aimed at defending Iran against
both U.S. and Iraqi attack.
   On Thursday, Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam
reiterated Iranian threats of a ``blow'' in response to the downing
of the passenger plane, Tehran radio reported.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday that ``humane and moral'' considerations will figure
heavily in any decision on compensation.
   Sheikholeslam was quoted as saying that Iran had contacted the
International Civil Aviation Administration and requested that an
expert delegation be sent to study the incident.
   In the same radio broadcast, Iran Air Managing Director Mohammad
Reza Majidi said less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only
150 identified.
   He said the plane's ``black box'' data recorder had not been
recovered, nor had any portions of the plane that were ``big enough
for studies to really be carried out.''
   Of the 290 people on the jet, 66 were children. There were 38
foreigners aboard.

   Rescue workers said today they had
abandoned hope of finding 149 workers missing after an explosion
blew apart a North Sea oil rig in the worst such disaster ever.
   Seventeen bodies and 64 survivors were pulled from the chilly
waters after the blast. Police said at least two Americans were on
the rig when it exploded. Their fate was unknown.
   ``We, of course, gave up any chance of finding anyone else
alive, most regrettably, at sunset last night (Thursday),'' Derek
Ancona, commander of the Aberdeen Search and Rescue Region, told
the British Broadcasting Corp.
   More than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil rigs in the
North Sea resigned today, citing concerns about safety of the
offshore industry in the North Sea.
   ``They felt some action had to be taken, concerning safety
...,'' Keith Gibson, an official with the General, Municipal,
Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union told the BBC.
   U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum said a gas leak apparently
caused the blast Wednesday night on the Piper Alpha oil rig 120
miles off Scotland, but it did not know what caused the gas to
ignite.
   The disaster is expected to cost insurers more than $1 billion
in claims, which would be a record, the Lloyd's of London insurance
market said. Lloyd's spokesman David Larner said Occidental insured
the rig, plus the costs of any loss of life claims, salvaging the
rig, redrilling and pollution.
   The rig was still burning. Occidental said Paul ``Red'' Adair of
Houston, Texas, an expert in capping out-of-control oil wells,
would try to stop it. Adair was brought in to cap the first blowout
on a North Sea rig in April 1977.
   Armand Hammer, the chairman of Occidental Petroleum, flew in
from Los Angeles and landed at Aberdeen's airport, where flags were
at half-staff. He conferred with company heads in Aberdeen before
visiting injured survivors at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
   Hammer told reporters the company was donating one million
pounds, or $1.7 million, to a trust fund set up for the victims and
their families.
   The Coast Guard said six oil industry ships, the
semi-submersible rig Tharos and one Coast Guard helicopter resumed
searching today at dawn.
   On Thursday, about 30 ships, 15 helicopters and a Royal Air
Force reconnaissance plane were involved in the search.
   A death toll of 166 would make this the world's worst oil rig
disaster, surpassing the 123 deaths when the Alexander L. Kielland
platform capsized in Norwegian North Sea waters in March 1980.
   Aberdeen police spokesman Donald Halkerson said those aboard the
rig when it blew up included two Americans, two Canadians, a South
African, a Frenchman, a West German, a Portuguese and a Spaniard.
He said the rest were believed to be British.
   Authorities have refused to issue any names, and Halkerson
refused to say if the non-British were among survivors, the
confirmed dead or those still missing.
   Survivors said that when the platform blew up, at least half of
those on the rig were in its accommodation block. The blast
demolished the block and turned the rig into a tower of flame.
   Eoin Kerr, communications officer at British Telecom's maritime
radio station at Wick on the Scottish coast, told reporters he was
in contact with the rig when the blast occurred.
   Kerr said the last message he heard was: ``We're abandoning the
rig. Jesus Christ, we've got to get out of here. There's no more
time. We've got to get out.'' Then the line went dead.
   Occidental said 75 percent of the 649-foot-high rig was
destroyed.
   Some survivors told of having to choose between braving the
flames in hope help would come, or plunging 150 feet into an ocean
blanketed with burning oil but cold enough to kill.
   ``It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said Roy
Carey, 45, who jumped. Rescue pilots said flames were up to 400
feet high.
   John Maxwell, 50, who was aboard the semi-submersible rig Tharos
alongside the doomed platform, said: ``I saw a group of about six
or seven men in survival suits on the rig's helicopter pad with
flames all round them. They were screaming, shouting and waving for
help ... Then the whole of the rig was rocked by another huge
explosion and a kind of fireball shot across the helipad and all
the men on it disappeared.''
   Others said the rig became so hot that water jetted onto it from
fire-fighting ships simply turned to steam.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government promised what it called a deep and
far-reaching inquiry into the disaster. But questions arose over
safety standards in the North Sea, which oilmen regard as one of
the most hazardous production areas in the world.
   Opposition politicians said safety was neglected. Ron Todd,
general secretary of the 1.3-million member Transport and General
Workers Union, some of whose members work on North Sea rigs, said:
``The tragedy will clearly raise questions regarding safety in the
North Sea oil industry.''

<HEAD>CDC Reports First U.S. Human Anthrax Case Since 1984</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal health officials have reported the
nation's first case of human anthrax since 1984, which apparently
started with contaminated cashmere at a textile plant.
   A 42-year-old maintenance man at the North Carolina textile mill
became ill in July 1987 with a small red lesion on his arm, and
developed pain, fever and chills over the following week, the
Centers for Disease Control said Thursday in its weekly report.
   The patient was diagnosed with a cutaneous form of anthrax, a
severe and potentially fatal disease most commonly found in cattle
and sheep.
   Only nine other human anthrax cases have occurred in the United
States in the past decade, the CDC said.
   Vaccination programs were recommended for workers at the North
Carolina plant and at a Texas plant where the cashmere was washed,
said the CDC, which, as is its custom, did not identify the
locations involved.
   The patient, who later recovered, hadn't recently been out of
North Carolina, the CDC said. However, his mill used wool from
Australia and New Zealand, cashmere goat hair from China,
Afghanistan and Iran, and camel hair from China and Mongolia.
   Eight of 59 textile samples from the mill tested _ including
five samples of West Asian cashmere _ showed contamination with
anthrax bacteria, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   ``The West Asian cashmere was probably the contaminant,'' the
CDC reported. ``Western Asia is an endemic area for anthrax.''
   The other three contaminated samples were either debris or
Australian wool, which may have been cross-contaminated while
stored near the cashmere, the agency said.

   A top legislative aide for former Arizona
Gov. Evan Mecham has been named director of development for the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
   In the new position, Donna Carlson will be in charge of the
chamber's participation in the Hollywood redevelopment program and
its entertainment industry-related events, work as an ombudswoman
and try to generate membership.
   Ms. Carlson was the legislative liaison for the Republican
governor but resigned before he was forced from office. She said
she received a death threat for her willingness to testify before a
grand jury investigating Mecham. Mecham's handling of the
investigation into the threat formed the basis of one count of his
impeachment and removal from office.
   Ms. Carlson served for eight years as a member of the Arizona
House of Representatives. After losing a bid for Congress in 1982,
she moved to California in 1984 to set up a branch office for an
Arizona company that manufactures road equipment.
   She returned to Arizona two years later to become executive
director of a Phoenix-based trade association, then returned to
public service to work for Mecham.
   In October, she attributed her departure to frustration over an
inability to get clear signals from her bosses.

   Relatives of the Iranian pilot whose
jetliner was shot down last weekend say there's no way he could
have been on a suicide mission.
   ``No, no. If you had known him, if you could talk to him once,
you would never imagine that,'' Nahy Sadeghi said of her
brother-in-law, Mohsen Rezaian.
   ``It's not even possible. He was a very good human being. He
valued people. He valued people's lives. He would never do such a
thing,'' Mrs. Sadeghi, of Norman, said in an interview Thursday
night with KWTV in Oklahoma City.
   The Defense Department acknowledged Thursday that the Iranian
A300 Airbus shot down by the U.S. warship was within a commercial
airline corridor, but said that alone did not guarantee its safety.
Iranian authorities say 290 people died in the downing.
   Mrs. Sadeghi's husband, Kamran, also told the television station
that it's unlikely the plane was off course when shot down by a
U.S. Navy ship Sunday.
   ``I think he flew that route many times and just like me and you
going from our homes to work and come back, we know our way. I
think it's the same way for him. So he should have been quite
familiar with it. I am positive,'' Sadeghi said.
   The Sadeghis said their brother-in-law was trained by Boeing in
Texas and dreamed of coming to live in the United States someday.
   Rezaian's wife, Mrs. Sadeghi's sister, gave birth to their
youngest child in Oklahoma, the Sadeghis say.
   Rezaian was a 15-year veteran of Iran Air, the couple said.
   The Iranian Embassy identified the pilot on Thursday. KWTV said
the Sadeghis provided documentation that they were related to the
pilot.

   More than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil
rigs in the North Sea resigned today over concerns about safety
following the world's worst oil rig disaster.
   Wednesday night's fire on Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Piper
Alpha platform off the coast of Scotland left 17 people dead and
another 149 people missing and presumed dead. Occidental said a gas
leak triggered the blaze.
   In the West Sole gas field, 100 to 150 workers employed by a
contractor refurbishing three British Petroleum Co. platforms
resigned over safety concerns in the North Sea in general, British
Petroleum said.
   A company spokesman said the workers issued a letter saying they
resigned ``due to current offshore working conditions in general in
the offshore industry.''
   ``They felt some action had to be taken concerning safety,''
Keith Gibson, an official with the General, Municipal, Boilermakers
and Allied Trades Union told the British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   The British Petroleum spokesman, who wasn't identified in
accordance with British practice, said negotiations between the
contractor, Press Offshore Services Division, and its employees
``are in progress.''
   The workers were being brought back on shore, he said.
   But another company spokesman said workers were not involved and
that production was running normally.
   The North Sea oil platform blaze is expected to cost insurers
more than $1 billion in claims, which would be a record, the Lloyds
of London insurance market said.
   David Larner, a spokesman for Lloyds, said the insurance costs
for the fire ``could top $1 billion. It would make it the largest
loss in the North Sea and probably the largest loss on any one
unit.''
   A unit is one item, as opposed to a wider disaster, which
prompts a myriad of related claims.
   Occidental Petroleum said Thursday that the company has adequate
insurance to cover the disaster. The company insured the rig, plus
the costs of any loss of life claims, salvaging the rig, redrilling
and any pollution, Larner said.
   The latest figure dwarfs the estimated $172 million in insurance
costs for the previous worst oil rig disaster, the 1980 capsize of
the Alexander L. Kielland rig in the North Sea off Norway, which
killed 123 people, according to Press Association, the domestic
news agency.
   Press Association reported that the Piper Alpha rig was insured
for $550 million and that the loss of life claims would come to an
estimated $172 million.
   The insurance policies for the platform have been spread
throughout the Lloyd's of London market and overseas, and nobody is
expected to go out of business over the disaster, Larner said.
   ``The risk is placed literally around the world. Although it's a
very large loss, it's unlikely to hurt any particular individual.
The whole essence of insurance is to spead the risk as widely as
possible,'' Larner said.
   Occidental Petroleum said Thursday the destruction of the
platform would cut the company's annual profit by about 5 percent
to 10 percent.
   Company President Ray Irani said the accident would cost 5 cents
to 10 cents a share.
   Occidental Petroleum's stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $26.25
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday.
   Occidental's profit in 1987 was $240 million, or $1.06 a share,
on revenue of $17.75.

   IRA guerrillas today shelled
two police stations and mistakenly hit a school and several houses.
A British soldier was killed by a bomb blast near a swimming pool
where two people were slain earlier, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army said one of its fighters, Seamus
Woods, 22, died in a mortar attack on a police station at Pomeroy
in County Tyrone. Police said his body was found in a field
alongside a tractor-trailer used in the attack.
   Six people suffered minor injuries when a mortar raid on a
second police station in Stewartson, about 10 miles from Pomeroy,
went astray and damaged a primary school and several houses, police
said. They said 80 families were evacuated.
   The IRA claimed reponsibilty for the attacks.
   The IRA said the bombing of a swimming pool in west Belfast on
Thursday evening was an ``operation that went tragically wrong.''
The outlawed group said in a statement to Belfast media that the
bomb, which killed two civilians, was accidentally triggered by one
of its men.
   The British soldier, a bomb disposal expert, was killed early
today by a blast only yards from the swimming pool where he was
involved in clean-up operations, police said.
   The mainly Catholic IRA targets security forces in its guerrilla
war to end British rule in predominantly Protestant Northern
Ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.
   On Thursday, police said a bomb was planted against the inside
wall of a building housing the swimming pool in the predominately
Roman Catholic Falls Road area of West Belfast. The blast killed
two people and injured four others.
   The bomb exploded after armed and masked men ordered staff and
members of the public out of the swimming pool.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the bomb apparently was meant
to bring the walls of the building down on a security patrol
passing by outside. But the blast missed the patrol and hit
civilians instead.
   Local residents identified the two dead people as Elizabeth
Hamill, 60, and Eamonn Gilroy, 24, both Catholics from west
Belfast. Among those hurt was a 4-year-old girl.
   RUC Chief Inspector Ian Williamson said: ``The first explosion
was a disgusting atrocity compounded by the second blast. Here was
a soldier engaged in trying to make the area safe again for local
people.
   ``It clearly demonstrates the lengths these fiendish people will
go to pursue their bloodlust.''
   In the mortar attacks, police said the station at Pomeroy
suffered little damage when one mortar exploded inside a fenced-in
area. The second attack 15 minutes later missed the Stewartstown
station but damaged the school and nearby houses, they said.

   The Soviet Union's top military officer got
a first-hand look at American military power as he watched the Navy
flex its sea and air muscle and saw Marines deploy men and
equipment under simulated combat conditions.
   It was part of a whirlwind tour of American military bases
Thursday by Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of the Soviet Union's
general staff.
   After watching Air Force demonstrations at nearby Langley Air
Force Base today, the group was to leave for visits to bases in
Texas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. They will return to Washington,
D.C., on Sunday.
   Akhromeyev, a soldier since 1940 when he joined the Soviet army
as a 17-year-old, started the tour Thursday at Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
where elements of the 2nd Marine Division demonstrated quick
deployment. In the afternoon, the party was flown out to the
aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt as it cruised about 80 miles
off the Virginia coast.
   There the commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet, Adm. Frank
B. Kelso II, gave the Soviet officer a tour of the Navy's newest
nuclear-powered carrier.
   The carrier visit featured a demonstration of various aircraft
aboard the ship, including the F-14 Tomcat and F-18 Hornet, and was
topped by a ``wall of water'' demonstration in which an A-6E
Intruder attack bomber dropped 18,000 pounds of bombs, creating a
huge surge of water.
   Asked whether the United States should be showing its best
military hardware to a potential enemy, Kelso said: ``I guess
there's always a risk that you give something away when you show
anybody anything. But remember, deterrence also is a perception,
and it's hard to have a perception unless you can see what you want
to think about.''
   Akhromeyev said he was pleased with the demonstration.
   ``I liked it very much as a military man,'' he said through one
of his aides. ``I observed the up-to-date weapons and the highest
standards of performance, and, of course, I liked it.''
   At Camp Lejeune, the Marines gave the visiting Soviets a
demonstration of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, coordinating
infantry, airplanes, helicopters, artillery and other equipment.
   Akhromeyev, the first Soviet military officer to visit the base,
gave a ``thumbs up'' sign at a demonstration of an AV-8B Harrier,
an attack plane which can take off and land vertically.
   His host is Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Crowe has accepted an invitation to make a
reciprocal visit to the Soviet Union.
   After watching the Navy's demonstration Thursday, Crowe and
Akhromeyev went to colonial Williamsburg to join their wives in a
carriage ride down historic Duke of Gloucester Street.

   A horse-drawn wagon that appeared in the
burning-of-Atlanta scene in the movie ``Gone With The Wind'' will
be up for sale Saturday, along with the buckboard from the TV
series ``The Rifleman.''
   The ``Gone With The Wind'' water wagon was seen dashing across
the street behind Scarlet O'Hara and Rhett Butler. Also on the
auction block alongside other props will be a gypsy wagon used in a
few Laurel and Hardy movies.
   The items will be among an assortment of 23 Hollywood
horse-drawn hitches and other Old West paraphernalia.
   Joe and Anna Belle Nimmo, who have been collecting horse-drawn
carriages for years, are selling out and everything must go.
   ``We no longer have the strength to take care of them,'' said
Mrs. Nimmo. ``It's just become a bit much. My husband is 70, and
I'm 49. We don't want them to disintegrate, and we want people to
take care of them.''
   For a few years, the Nimmos rented their carriages for parades
and weddings. When they tired of hauling the carriages around town
they built an Old West town facade on their 12{-acre ranch and
started filming TV commercials.
   ``When you get the people in costumes, and the vehicles, and the
horses, and stand back and look, you'd swear you were in the Old
West,'' Mrs. Nimmo said.
   ``It's such fun, it really is,'' she said. ``I hate to see it
depart from my life.''
   Also for sale are a mint condition Hollywood stage coach, used
in an unknown number of Westerns; the coronation coach that carried
Norma Shearer in the 1938 movie ``Marie Antoinette;'' and a landau
that carried participants in Queen Elizabeth II's real coronation
parade in 1952.
   The Nimmos can't document many of the histories of their
coaches, but say they bought many right off movie studio lots and
studio executives told them of the vehicles' film roles.
   ``Prices range up to $35,000,'' Mrs. Nimmo said. ``If that stage
coach were real and not a replica, it could bring $100,000.''

   The world's worst offshore oil platform disaster
is raising questions about safety in an industry in which hundreds
have died, and the carnage has led some Britons to wonder whether
the oil is worth the human cost.
   ``The price of North Sea oil and gas is written in blood,'' the
Daily Mirror said in an editorial today.
   More than 160 people were killed or missing and presumed killed
in the the explosion and fire Wednesday on the Piper Alpha platform
in the North Sea.
   ``Charges of putting oil production above life preservation are
bound to resurge in the coming weeks,'' The Times of London said in
an editorial today.
   ``The general attention to safety in the North Sea is extremely
high ... but it is not always enough,'' the paper said. ``On
Wednesday night it was not enough.''
   Roy Carey, who was badly burned, said from a bed in Aberdeen
Royal Infirmary in Aberdeen, Scotland: ``We had all that water
around us and no way to get it to us. We had sprinklers but they
weren't strong enough.''
   The deaths bring to more than 300 the number of people who have
died in the British sector of the North Sea since gas was first
pumped ashore in 1967.
   Drilling accidents killed 76 and a helicopter crash killed 45.
Last year, six workers were killed and 59 seriously hurt among the
28,000 British workers.
   Three workers from Piper Alpha died after being thrown into the
sea when a gangway collapsed in 1982. In 1984, a non-fatal
explosion and fire forced the evacuation of 174 men.
   Today, more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil rigs in
the North Sea resigned, citing concerns about safety of the
offshore industry in the North Sea.
   ``They felt some action had to be taken ...,'' Keith Gibson, a
spokesman for the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied
Trades Union, told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The Daily Mirror, which supports the socialist opposition Labor
Party, said: ``We must harness the talents of the best engineers,
scientists and managers to develop new and better materials,
systems and services to make the crews safer from all hazards,
including human error.''
   Occidental Petroleum, which operates the platform, said
Wednesday's fire apparently was caused by a gas leak.
   The liberal London newspaper The Guardian wrote: ``If, as
initial diagnosis suggests, only a leak of gas could have triggered
the series of explosions which wrecked the platform, there are
obvious questions about standards of maintenance, the handling and
storage of flammable materials and the rest.
   ``Account must be taken of the testimony from the unions ...
that they were frozen out of safety management procedures and that
complaints and warnings were insufficiently heeded.''
   Ron Todd, general secretary of the 1.3-million member Transport
and General Workers Union, some of whose members work on North Sea
oil rigs, said Thursday: ``The tragedy will clearly raise questions
regarding safety in the North Sea oil industry.''
   Labor unions also have complained about the quality and
avilability of survival gear and too few rescue helicopters. They
see a conflict of interest in making the Energy Department
responsible for oil production as well as safety.
   In Parliament, lawmaker John Prescott of the opposition Labor
Party contended that inspection and maintenance of rigs had been
reduced in recent years. He said insufficient money was spent on
training and that government health and safety legislation did not
apply fully to the North Sea oil and gas industry.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson said serious North Sea
accidents had declined from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year. ``But that
is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure
that improvement is maintained,'' he said.
   The department Thursday postponed the process for granting new
off-shore licenses, which would open up more areas for exploration.
   Meanwhile, the price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, jumped on Thursday to $15.05 a barrel for
September delivery, up 32 cents from late Wednesday.
   Occidental Petroleum said the rig produced 167,200 barrels a
day. A barrel contains 42 gallons.
   The Energy Department said that in addition to the Piper oil
field, five other fields were shut down, cutting production by
about 220,000 barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day, or about
one-tenth of the British sector's production.
   ``There's pressure on the immediate availability for North Sea
crude,'' said Philip Morgan, an oil analyst with the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.
   But Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst with the London investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said the shortage would be short-term.
She said the related fields should be back in production in a week,
and Piper Alpha should be back in about a year.
   But there were concerns about claims against the company, and
Occidental Petroleum's stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $26.25
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The disaster could prove expensive for the North Sea oil
producers in general, Morgan said.
   ``Obviously, questions are going to be raised about safety which
might involve companies in a lot more expenditure,'' he said.

<HEAD>Australian Called Top PTL Candidate, But Bakker Says His Plan's
Better</HEAD>

   Deposed PTL founder Jim Bakker says his
proposal to buy and revive PTL's Christian theme park and
television ministry is the best, but PTL's bankruptcy trustee says
an Australian is the leading candidate.
   ``This is 100 percent payout of all debts to all creditors,''
Bakker said of his plan Thursday. ``I don't know of a better deal
over the table or under the table.''
   Bakker said at a brief news conference outside his office that
an overseas financial group is willing to lend him the money he
needs to regain control of the ministry. He said the lenders
insisted they not be identified publicly.
   Bakker said he gave details of his takeover plan to trustee M.C.
``Red'' Benton on Thursday and said he was allowing Benton 48 hours
to consider it before releasing it to the public.
   But while Benton had previously said he was open to any plan to
save PTL and that Bakker was welcome to submit a plan, he said
Wednesday that he changed his position this week because Bakker's
presence threatened to deprive the ministry of all donations.
   ``With Mr. Bakker sort of confusing the issue at this time with
his appearances, people have said they won't give while he's here.
I know the Bring Bakkers Back (group) won't support us. I can't
afford to risk losing the people we do have supporting us,'' Benton
said.
   ``He will not have a part in this ministry as long as I'm
trustee.'
   Benton said Gavin Morehu, described as a millionaire Christian
involved in the import-export business in Australia, has offered to
pay $200 million for the PTL complex just south of Charlotte, N.C.
   Morehu ``has until July 15 to come up with an initial deposit of
an earnest $50 million. Then we'll work out a contract. If he
doesn't make the deposit, he's out,'' Benton said.
   The ministry has been in financial straits since Bakker left in
March 1987 after revelations he had a sexual tryst with a church
secretary, Jessica Hahn, then paid her to keep quiet about it.
   Revelations of Jim and Tammy Bakker's luxurious lifestyle
followed, the ministry foundered as donations dwindled, and the
ministry filed for bankruptcy court reorganization with $130
million in debt.
   Benton said Bakker needs to work out many of his own financial
and personal problems before he could return to PTL, including
troubles with the Internal Revenue Service, his failure to
reconcile with the Assemblies of God church and several lawsuits,
including one with PTL.
   Bakker and his financial dealings at PTL also are the object of
a federal grand jury investigation in Charlotte, according to
published reports.
   Bakker said he would provide a financial statement from Dun &
Bradstreet showing his lender is worth $2.3 billion.
   The latest reorganization plan calls for much of PTL's assets to
be sold and for a new, debt-free, non-profit ministry to be formed
with the leased use of the PTL complex's studios and church.
   Benton said he is continuing to discuss the possible sale with
potential buyers and hopes to recommend a buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia by Aug. 1.

<HEAD>Normal Window Service Returning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Window service at the nation's post offices,
reduced earlier this year to save money, will return to normal in
September, the Postal Service announced today.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank, who made the announcement,
said the agency has found sufficient savings in other areas to
allow it to restore full window hours.
   The announcement came at a meeting of the postal Board of
Governors at which Frank disclosed that the controversial
consulting contract with Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot may have
to be renegotiated.
   The Postal Service announced the 10 percent reduction in window
hours in January as one step to save $160 million from its
expenditures this year and bring it into compliance with spending
reductions ordered by Congress. It was left to local postmasters to
decide when to close the windows.
   Frank said that normal window service will be restored effective
on Sept. 10.
   But the service restoration will not necessarily mean a return
to the old schedules, Frank said. Rather, he said he has told
postmasters to open windows during the hours deemed most
appropriate for their communities.
   Frank did not address cutbacks in Sunday mail sorting, a
reduction also made earlier in January to save money.
   Turning to the Perot contract, Frank said will have to be
modified because of the controversy surrounding the deal.
   If some sort of agreement can't be worked out with Perot, he
said, the deal may have to be cancelled. ``I hope that will not be
the case,'' Frank added.
   The Perot contract is a potentially multi-million-dollar deal
calling for an analysis of postal operations in an effort to find
ways of saving money. It carries an initial $500,000 price tag, but
subsequently would provide Perot a share of any savings that result
from recommendations he makes.
   The contract, which was not open for bids, has been challenged
by at least two would-be competitors who asked the General Services
Administration to order it suspended. The Postal Service has argued
that the GSA has no jurisdiction in the matter.
   Congress has also been involved in the controversy, ordering a
study of the arrangement by the General Accounting Office.
   Frank gave no details on what sort of modifications might be
made in the deal with Perot.

   A former bodyguard for the rap music group
Run-DMC has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death
of a man at a concert two years ago.
   Garfield Brown had been scheduled for a preliminary hearing
Thursday in Municipal Court in connection with the death of Alex
Baldwin, 21.
   Police said several fights broke out during a Run-DMC concert at
Selland Arena in this city 200 miles north of Los Angeles on Aug.
15, 1986, and Brown and two other bodyguards left the stage to help
restore order.
   Brown was charged with throwing Baldwin to the concrete floor
and kicking him. Baldwin died of head injuries two weeks later, and
Brown was arrested in New York City.
   He will be sentenced in Superior Court on Aug. 1. The maximum
sentence he could receive is four years in prison.

   U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf were on
watch over the July 4th weekend for a handful of Iranian F-14
fighters recently stationed near the mouth of the Persian Gulf but
rarely risked in combat.
   The commander of the USS Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III,
thought he was under attack by an Iranian F-14 when he fired two
SM-2 anti-aircraft missiles at Iran Air flight 655, an A300 Airbus
with 290 civilians aboard.
   But the F-14 is primarily designed for combat against other
aircraft. And Pentagon sources said Iran hardly ever flies any of
its few operational F-14s in combat.
   Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage said last
February that it appeared Iran had begun increasing its use of
F-14s because of the plane's strong radar, and that one of them
shot down an Iraqi Mirage over the the main Iranian oil terminal at
Kharg Island last Feb. 9.
   ``This is the first effective use in combat we've seen in
several months, as I remember,'' Armitage said then.
   A U.S. military source with gulf experience said the Iranians,
although using the F-14s more in recent months to monitor the
movement of tankers carrying Iranian oil, seemed wary of sending
them into combat. ``They have sent them up to escort tankers, and
put them up when Iraqi fighters were around, but they always veered
off and stayed out of danger,'' said the source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   That raises yet another question in the mystery of why a $1
billion Aegis cruiser, with the most sophisticated radar and
tracking system in the Navy, mistook an Iranian A300 Airbus with
290 civilians aboard for an F-14 and blasted it out of the sky at a
range of nine miles.
   To be effective against a ship as large as the Vincennes, 567
feet long and displacing 9,600 tons when fully loaded, the F-14
would need to be equipped with armaments that it does not
ordinarily carry, such as anti-ship missiles or bombs.
   Or, said one air industry source, ``if somebody loaded that
sucker with 30,000 pounds of fuel, it would make one hell of a bomb
on a kamikaze run.''
   The commander of U.S. forces in the region, Marine Corps Gen.
George B. Crist, told reporters last Thursday that Iran recently
moved an unspecified number of F-14s from their main base at
Isfahan, central Iran, to Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf.
   Iran Air flight 655 took off from the joint civilian-military
field at Bandar Abbas while Iranian Boghammar gunboats were
attacking the Vincennes in the Strait of Hormuz, and headed for the
U.S. warship.
   The airliner broadcast an identification signal similar to one
used by Iranian F-14s, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   ``I don't think it is related to us ...,'' said Crist. ``I think
this has to do with reaction to the Iraqis'' attacking tankers in
the southern gulf, and ``not so much the Americans.''
   But the development clearly worried U.S. skipper in the gulf.
   Asked why the Vincennes was afraid of a plane that had never
been used against a surface target, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard
said: ``We do know that the Iranians have Harpoon (anti-ship
missiles) in their inventory which they can sling under an F-14
with no difficulty.
   ``We have suspected for some time that they have been working
with Standards in an air-to-ground or air-to-surface mode. And the
iron bomb is another possibility. So, if your question is, `Does an
Iranian F-14 constitute a threat to U.S. naval vessels?' the answer
is, `Yes.'''
   The chaiman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe,
told a news conference Sunday that ``we have alerted our forces of
indications that Iranian units might carry out attacks against our
forces over the July Fourth period.''
   Before the fall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran
acquired about 80 of the F-14s from the Grumman Corp. of Long
Island, New York.
   Hundreds of American technicans were stationed at Isfahan,
maintaining the F-14s and teaching the Iranians to fly them.
   After the revolution, U.S. arms shipments were cut off, and Iran
more or less grounded its F-14s once its war with Iraq began in
September 1980.
   Only within the past year has Iran managed to get the spare
parts it needs to make as many as 15 of the F-14s operational,
according to administration officials.
   It is not clear where Iran is getting the parts, but U.S.
intelligence reports that a North Korean ship docked at Bandar
Abbas at the end of June, and may have contained F-14 components
and possibly weapons.
   The F-14 can fly faster than Mach 2, twice the speed of sound,
or about 1,320 mph at an altitude of 30,000 feet, and those in the
U.S. Navy carry six Phoenix, four Sparrow and four Sidewinder
anti-aircraft missiles and are armed with a 20mm Vulcan Mk-61
cannon, capable of firing up to 6,000 rounds a minute.

   Fourteen survivors of a mortar accident that
left two other Marines dead have been flown to Honolulu for further
medical treatment, officials said.
   The Marines were conducting a night training exercise Wednesday
night when they were hit by shrapnel from exploding 60mm shells at
the Pohakuloa Training Area on Hawaii Island, Maj. Kerry K.
Gershaneck said Thursday.
   Ten Marines were taken Thursday to Tripler Army Medical Center
near Honolulu, where they joined four other Marines wounded in the
accident, hospital spokesman George Vidis said.
   Vidis said all 14 were listed in satisfactory condition.
Gershaneck had earlier said only eight Marines were hospitalized.
   Investigators were working to determine why the mortar shells
landed among about 30 Marines, Gershaneck said. The names of the
injured would be released once all their families were notified, he
said.
   The dead were identified as Gunnery Sgt. Howard E. Harris, 34,
of Philadelphia, and Cpl. Clifford L. Carlisle II, 21, of Roswell,
N.M.,
   Harris was the platoon sergeant and Carlisle was a mortarman for
the 81mm mortar platoon of the Marine 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine
Regiment stationed at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station near
Honolulu, Gershaneck said.
   Lt. John Renfro, the battalion's chaplain, was one of the first
people to arrive at the scene of the accident.
   ``These are young men, who don't have a lot of experience with
death and a lot of experience with injury,'' Renfro said. ``So the
men, many of them, were just sitting, stunned.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned
today with another potential vice presidential candidate, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, and said ``I'm pondering'' whether to select the
Texan.
   Dukakis also said he favored some form of U.S. payments to the
victims of the shot-down Iranian airliner.
   ``I think some sort of humanitarian assistance would probably be
appropriate,'' he said.
   The Democratic nominee-in-waiting praised Bentsen's work as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and was asked by reporters
whether Bentsen would be more valuable in the Senate.
   ``I'm pondering. He could make a great contribution to the
country in many many ways. He already has,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis spoke at an outdoor rally with Bentsen, Arkansas Sen.
Dale Bumpers and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who will place
Dukakis' name in nomination at the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta in less than two weeks.
   Bentsen, asked if he wanted the job, said, ``I don't think we
have to worry about that.''
   Dukakis said he had discussed the job with Bentsen ``from time
to time'' but declined to say if they had talked on the subject
today.
   Dukakis also declined to say when he would select a running
mate, saying only ``sometime between now and the last day of the
convention, I guess.''
   The Massachusetts governor began his four-day trip through six
Western and Rocky Mountain states Wednesday evening, jabbing at
Bush in the vice president's adopted home state of Texas. Dukakis
went before a Hispanic group in Dallas where Bush a day earlier had
made a ``solemn pledge'' to put a Hispanic in his Cabinet.
   ``Some people think it's enough to wake up after eight years and
then promise opportunity for one Hispanic,'' Dukakis said in
reference to Bush's promise. ``I want to stand with you and create
opportunity for 20 million Hispanic citizens across this country.''
   Speaking to the League of United Latin American Citizens
convention, Dukakis made fleeting reference to a similar pledge he
made _ to appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet if elected _ at the
group's meeting a year earlier.
   ``I'm just looking around the room for Cabinet secretaries,''
Dukakis said as he received the gathering's welcoming applause.
   Dukakis was flying to Arizona later in the day for an appearance
with former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, an early drop-out from the
Democratic presidential race. He also planned stops in California,
Oregon, Washington and at a park in the Colorado Rockies before
returning to Boston on Sunday.
   Texas and California loom as major electoral battlegrounds for
the fall campaign, and like the others represent states that have
generally gone Republican in recent presidential elections.
   Dukakis aides depicted his trip _ his third campaign swing since
locking up the nomination in California a month ago _ as signaling
the Democrat's intention to challenge for those states this fall
and serve notice on Bush that he will have to protect his
traditional GOP base as that party's nominee.
   ``It sends another strong geographic signal that we can win
anywhere, even in places that have been historically Republican,
because that's the nature of this thing,'' said Leslie Dach,
Dukakis' communications director.
   He said that extended to Arizona, the most reliably Republican
and conservative of those states.
   ``It means George Bush has no secure base, and if he wants to
win there, he's going to have to campaign there,'' Dach said.
   Dukakis' schedule remained in flux up to his departure, however,
as the campaign dropped plans to visit Montana and added a stop in
Oregon.
   Dukakis and Bush both made forays into each other's territory
Thursday, as Bush's Air Force II taxied by Dukakis' chartered jet
on the tarmac in Boston as the vice president arrived for
appearances in the Democrat's home city.
   Before departing Boston, Dukakis said Bush's promise to
Hispanics amounted to a ``rather late'' commitment to affirmative
action. He accused the vice president of breaking his pledge not to
support new taxes by supporting a provision of the trade bill that
calls for $1 billion in taxes for job training programs and
catastrophic health care legislation that included $6 billion in
taxes on elderly people who opt for the comprehensive care.
   ``So much for iron-clad no tax commitments,'' said Dukakis, who
himself had to renege on a no-tax pledge in his first term as
governor.
   In Dallas, Dukakis took a swipe at departing Attorney General
Edwin Meese III while at the same time criticizing Bush and the
Reagan administration for opposing legislation passed by the Senate
requiring 60 days' notice for workers before companies close plants.
   He said it was ironic that Meese, in resigning, was ``willing to
give himself 30 days notice,'' while the Reagan and Bush ``don't
believe working Americans are entitled to one day's notice before
they're thrown out of their jobs.''

compensation; picks up 4th graf pvs, One of the.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today the administration
is considering the question of compensation for the destruction of
Iran air flight 655, but a spokesman said the issue has not yet
been submitted to the president for decision.
   Reagan, asked what he was going to do about compensation, said,
``All of that's under consideration.'' He was asked during a brief
appearance in the White House briefing room.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were ``still
some open questions'' on the compensation issue and it had not yet
gone to the president for a decision.
   ``There is a universe of issues to be considered related to
legal aspects of it, to the specifics of the incident, to relations
between the two countries, and to past experience and history,''
Fitzwater said.
   He would not be more specific.
   Fitzwater also disclosed that the United States has sent
messages of condolence to the countries from which the airline
passengers came, asking that sympathies be extended to the
families. The countries are Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
India, Yugoslavia and Italy.
   On Thursday, Fitzwater said, ``I suspect that doing what we
think is right will be the deciding factor.''
   Fitzwater's comments marked a significant change in the tone of
administration pronouncements after several days of noncommittal
responses on the issue of reparations for families of the 290
victims.
   ``One of the driving forces behind our consideration is simply
the moral responsibility of America and the fact that we've always
been a humane nation that takes these kinds of problems very
seriously and assumes personal responsibilities,'' he said.
   The Defense Department acknowledged Thursday that the Iranian
A300 Airbus shot down by the U.S. warship was within a commercial
airline corridor, but said that alone did not guarantee its safety.
   ``An airway is not a safety zone,'' said Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard. ``All this means is that within that zone, within that
area, the air traffic control authorities have agreed to track
aircraft.''
   Meawhile Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam
demanded that the United States pay compensation for shooting down
the civilian airliner.
   Sheikholeslam also called for revenge Thursday in a speech on
Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in a
report made available today.
   Fitzwater stressed that no decision on reparations has been made
either by senior staff or President Reagan. But in contrast to his
suggestion earlier this week that the decision will await the
outcome of the Navy's investigation of the incident, Fitzwater said
he wanted to emphasize that ``we're moving along through the
consideration process.''
   ``We don't have final decisions yet, but it clearly is an issue
that is under active discussion,'' Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said
Congress would likely support a request for compensation if it came
from the president.
   ``It should come from the president,'' Wright said.
   The Pentagon spokesman, in a briefing with reporters, said that
even though the airliner was in a civilian air corridor, Vincennes
skipper Capt. Will C. Rogers III still could not rule out the
chance he was facing an attacking F-14 fighter.
   Howard said Iran must share some responsibility for the deaths
because the Airbus took off from a military-civilian airport at
Bandar Abbas during an exchange of fire between the Vincennes and
Iranian gunboats.
   ``The Iranians are the ones who bear the responsibility for
ensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities,
they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident, that
they ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending
them into harm's way,'' Howard said.
   Howard discounted speculation on Capitol Hill that an Iranian
warplane might have been flying behind the commercial flight in an
attempt to use it as a cover to sneak up on the USS Vincennes.
   He repeated that U.S. warships had broadcast 12 warnings to the
Iranian aircraft, seven from the Vincennes and five from the USS
John H. Sides. And he released the transcript of an Iranian F-14
responding to a similiar warning the day before the Airbus went
down.
   The F-14 identified itself to the USS Halsey and ``went away,''
Howard said.
   On Sunday, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Adm.
William Crowe, had told reporters one reason Rogers believed the
Iranian aircraft was a military jet was that it was outside the air
corridor.
   But both Crowe and Howard have said the most compelling reason
Rogers mistook the aircraft for a military plane was an electronic
emission from the Airbus. On Tuesday, Howard identified the
transmission as signals broadcast on a frequency used only by
military aircraft.
   The signal sent by the Airbus, said Howard, was similar to codes
broadcast within the previous several days by Iranian F-14 fighters
recently stationed at Bandar Abbas.
   Iranian Air Flight 655 was 4{ miles from the center of a
civilian air corridor stretching from its departure point, Bandar
Abbas, to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates on the opposite side
of the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
   According to the code governing international air flights, said
Howard, ``commercial airliners, those carrying passengers, are
expected to adhere to the centerline of the airway.''
   But he said it was unclear how wide the air corridor was at the
point where the Airbus was hit, because Iran claims a corridor 10
miles on each side and many other countries, including the United
Arab Emirates, recognize a corridor four-and-a-half miles from the
center.
   ``The aircraft was at least four-and-a-half miles off the center
line of the airway and in that regard could be considered to be off
the normal track of commercial aircraft,'' said Howard.
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., said he had been told by Pentagon officials Tuesday
that the plane had wandered to the edge of the corridor, then tried
to right itself, heading straight at the Vincennes.
   The Vincennes was ``slightly to the east'' of the center of the
airway, he said.
   Fitzwater said there has been ``no response at all'' from Iran
to Reagan's message Sunday saying the incident was an accident and
expressing ``deep regret.''

   Some Long Island beaches were closed even
to sun bathers today after more medical waste washed ashore, and
one official said ``midnight dumpers'' were suspected of illegally
disposing of the debris.
   ``We are concerned that these people may be inadvertently hurt
by picking up this material,'' said Michael Asheroff, deputy
regional director of the Long Island State Park Commission. ``The
public is being kept from using this absolutely gorgeous facility.
It's a pity thery are being denied its use.''
   Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park were closed today after
plastic refuse, including syringes, washed ashore.
   Asheroff said any decision about reopening the beaches for the
weekend will be made after they are inspected each morning.
   The state park was closed to swimmers Thursday, hours after
health officials lifted a ban initiated Wednesday when the first
wave of hospital waste hit parts of Long Island's South Shore.
   Similar orders were given for Nassau Beach County Park and at
four Fire Island beaches: Kismet, Fair Harbor, Dunewood and
Atlantique. Several other beaches that were closed Wednesday were
reopened.
   Elsewhere, Bayonne, N.J., officials found four more glass blood
vials Thursday, bringing to 145 the number of vials found since
Sunday. Five of 105 vials tested were found to have the AIDS
antibody; 36 vials were still awaiting testing.
   The discovery came a month after five vials of blood were found
along the beach in Ocean County on the New Jersey shore. Two of
those vials were contaminated with the AIDS antibody, while a third
tested positive for the more highly infectious hepatitis B virus.
   On Thursday, New Jersey investigators met in New York with
representatives of the Nassau County District Attorney's Office and
the New York Attorney General's Office to discuss the cases.
   New York officials ordered the beach closings as a precaution
against the risk of infection from the potentially hazardous waste,
which also included intravenous tubing, gauze, rubber gloves and
pill containers.
   R.W. Groneman, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental
Conservation in Albany, said ``midnight dumpers'' were suspected _
haulers unwilling to abide by New York's toughened regulations on
medical trash disposal who get rid of it at sea under cover of
darkness.
   Groneman said the volume of debris indicated that it came from a
hospital or large clinic, and that any such institution's disposal
of medical trash would be regulated by the state. Such garbage must
be incinerated at the hospital or trucked by an approved hauler to
an incinerator or approved dump site.
   Inspectors combed the beaches collecting the material but found
no identifying markings, said Russell Keller, senior sanitary
engineer for the environmental conservation department.
   The Nassau and Suffolk County health departments took samples of
the ocean water to test for quality, with results expected today.
   Thursday's debris appeared to be heavier than the amounts that
forced the Wednesday shutdown of a 25-mile stretch of beaches,
including the Robert Moses and Jones Beach state parks, said
Michael Asheroff, deputy director of the Long Island State Park
Commission.
   Despite a summer heat wave, attendance at the beaches seemed
light Thursday. Normal attendance during weekdays is 50,000 to
60,000 at the state beaches.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes Fines Against Ashland Over Tank Rupture That
Polluted Rivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking
$31,800 in penalties against Ashland Oil Inc. in connection with an
oil tank collapse that fouled water supplies in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and West Virginia.
   The Jan. 2 collapse of the 4 million-gallon storage tank near
Pittsburgh spewed more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers in one of the worst inland oil spills
in U.S. history.
   Some 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents were without tap water
for a week, and cities all along the two rivers had water supplies
contaminated until the oil slick was finally diluted.
   The Labor Department's Occupational Health and Safety
Administration accused Ashland of willful violations in failing to
properly weld steel plates that formed the tank wall and failing to
repair defective welds after they were discovered. OSHA proposed a
$30,000 penalty on those points.
   OSHA also claimed a serious safety violation, with a proposed
penalty of $1,000, because the dike surrounding the tank was
inadequate to contain the oil, said Garry Griess, OSHA area
director in Pittsburgh.
   The agency is seeking an $800 penalty because Ashland failed to
establish a plan for responding to such an emergency and failed to
have a written safety plan for the Floreffe Terminal.
   Ashland officials are reviewing the citations and weighing their
options, which include formally contesting the civil charges, said
company spokesman Roger Schrum.
   OSHA spokesman Al Belsky in Philadelphia said Thursday that
Ashland had not yet contested the citations.
   The company did contest citations issued Jan. 28 totaling
$18,000 concerning alleged violations during the river cleanup.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned in Texas today, repaying
Republican George Bush's trip the previous day to the Massachusetts
governor's home grounds. Dukakis, standing by Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, said he was still deciding whom to choose as his running
mate.
   At a brief news conference in Texarkana, Texas, Dukakis
commented briefly about possible U.S. actions in the aftermath of
last Sunday's shooting down of an Iranian airliner by a U.S. ship.
``I think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be
appropriate,'' he said, without elaboration.
   In Atlanta, meanwhile, Democratic Party chairman Paul Kirk
released his letter to the White House accusing the Bush campaign
of not reimbursing the government for use of Air Force Two and
other vice presidential benefits on campaign trips.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said Kirk's statements ``are
totally without merit and are obviously designed to distract public
attention from the real issues. ... While I have not yet seen
Kirk's letter, the events I am told he questioned were financed in
accordanace with the law, and in no case were public funds used to
defray either campaign or Republican National Committee expenses
associated with trips.''
   The vice president was flying to Atlanta today to give a pep
talk at a Republican unity dinner.
   Dukakis, in Bush's adopted home state, praised Bentsen as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and was asked whether
Bentsen would be more valuable in the Senate than as a vice
presidential running mate.
   ``I'm pondering. He could make a great contribution to the
country in many, many ways. He already has,'' Dukakis said.
   Bentsen, asked if he wanted the job, said, ``I don't think we
have to worry about that.''
   Dukakis spoke at an outdoor rally with Bentsen, Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton and Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers at his side.
   On Thursday, Bush campaigned in Dukakis' Boston back yard and
said he shares the traditional values of the Greek-American
community from which the Massachusetts governor hails. Dukakis,
describing Bush's pledge to appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet as
too little and too late, said Americans are ``tired of waiting for
opportunity to trickle down'' from a privileged few.
   The two candidates also sparred from a distance over taxes, as
Dukakis accused the vice president of abandoning ``ironclad
commitments'' and favoring $7 billion in new taxes.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, was traveling to Dallas today for a
meeting with Dukakis aides, his campaign said. The Dukakis camp is
still negotiating with Jackson's forces over the civil rights
leader's plan to pursue as many as 13 minority planks at the
convention in Atlanta July 18.
   Bush, on Dukakis' home turf, spoke well of his rival.
   ``What a tribute it is to Greek-Americans, to our political
system, and to this great country of ours that we find it totally
natural that the son of an immigrant is one of two men still
contending to be president of the United States,'' Bush said in a
speech to a conference of the Greek Orthodox Church.
   ``Family, faith, education, hard work _ those are the keys and
no one knows it better than you,'' Bush said. ``It's the same
message you preach in your homes, the same way I was raised, the
same way Barbara (Bush's wife) and I raised our family.''
   Dukakis, however, portrayed Bush on Thursday as an elitist and
said the vice president's pledge to appoint a Hispanic-American to
his Cabinet comes after years of Reagan administration neglect of
minorities.
   ``Some people think it's enough to wake up after eight years and
then promise opportunity for one Hispanic,'' Dukakis told the
League of United Latin American Citizens, the same group Bush had
addressed a day earlier. ``I want to stand with you and create
opportunity for 20 million Hispanic citizens across the country.
   ``I've campaigned from one end of this country to another, and I
know that we Americans are ready for a change. We're tired of
waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few privileged
neighborhoods into our cities and into the small communities of
rural America.''
   Earlier Thursday, while still in Boston, Dukakis said Bush had
broken his pledge to oppose any new taxes. He said Bush supported a
provision of the trade bill that calls for $1 billion in taxes for
job training programs and catastrophic health care legislation that
included $6 billion in taxes on elderly people who opt for the
comprehensive care.
   ``So much for ironclad no-tax commitments,'' said Dukakis.
   Bush responded in Boston by referring to Dukakis' recent signing
of a state cigarette tax and his support for another measure
raising taxes. ``I'm against raising taxes, and I think recent
events here in this state that I don't plan to go into demonstrate
we have a different view on taxes,'' he said.
   In an effort to limit public disagreements as November nears,
Reagan and Bush directed their chiefs of staff Thursday to
coordinate campaign policy pronouncements and strategy.
   `I think everyone agrees that the main issue is, `No
surprises,''' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after
Reagan, Bush and aides met over lunch at the White House.
   Jackson, meanwhile, announced plans Thursday to lead a three-day
``Jackson Action Rainbow Express'' bus trip from Chicago to the
Atlanta convention.
   Jackson, in Atlanta, said his presidential campaign also will
sponsor workshops for people outside the convention hall. He said
the emphasis on non-delegates is intended to strengthen the party,
not detract from Dukakis.

   At least nine people,
including several involved in organizing birthday celebrations for
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, were detained today in raids in
Cape Town, relatives said.
   Those detained included Zollie Malindi, 64, president of the
anti-apartheid United Democratic Front in the Cape Town area, and
Rehana Rossouw, a journalist with the Argus newspaper, relatives
said.
   Sources said some of those detained had been organizing events
in Cape Town to mark the 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela,
imprisoned leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   Mandela's birthday is July 18. Organizers have been planning a
road race on July 16, church services the following day and a
ringing of church bells on July 18.
   In the Johannesburg area, black organizations have arranged an
all-day concert near the black township of Soweto.
   Under emergency regulations, outdoor gatherings and most forms
of public protest are banned unless permission is obtained. So far,
authorities have neither banned nor approved the events.
   Among those reportedly detained today were Veronica Simmers, an
administrative secretary with the UDF who has been detained
previously; Saleem Mowzer, a high school teacher; Jonathan Shapiro,
a newspaper cartoonist; Nabs Wessels, an executive member of the
Western Province Council of Churches; and Omar Badsha, who heads
the Center for Documentary Photography at the University of Cape
Town.
   Bulelani Ngcuka, a lawyer, and Nconde Balfour, a social worker,
also were detained, family members said.
   Badsha was scheduled to open an exhibition of his work at the
university Friday night. His wife said the program would proceed as
planned.
   Malindi, a long-time activist and a former member of the ANC,
was released in February after a previous detention. He is the
honorary president for the UDF in western Cape Province.
   The UDF, made up of more than 600 groups, is the country's
largest anti-apatheid organization. The coalition was one of 17
opposition groups that the government in February banned, and
virtually all its leaders are in detention, in hiding or under
restrictions.
   The government on Thursday freed Trevor Manuel, the most senior
full-time UDF figure in the Cape Town area. Manuel had been held
without charge since August 1986.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods of time since the government imposed a nationwide
state of emergency in June 1986.

   President Reagan will travel to the Midwest
Thursday to talk to drought-stricken farmers in Illinois and
revisit the Iowa radio station where he got his start in
broadcasting, the White House said today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the exact location of Reagan's
Illinois farm visit had not been determined.
   ``He wants to talk to farmers about the problem,'' Fitzwater
said. ``We are developing a legislative package and he feels it is
important to get some first-hand knowledge before sending the
package up.''
   After the Illinois farm stop, the president will go to WOC in
Davenport, Iowa, to dedicate the station's new building and help
observe its 60th anniversary.
   He will speak at a lunch sponsored by the station and the
Davenport Chamber of Commerce, to be held in Palmer Auditorium on
the Palmer College campus.
   Reagan began his career in radio by broadcasting Big 10 football
games on WOC in the fall of 1932, Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Mother In ``Pig'' Incident Lost Another Child In Beating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with child abuse for
dressing her son like a pig lost an infant 11 years ago when he was
beaten to death by his father, authorities said.
   Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Angela Backers said
Thursday it is too early to tell how the disclosure will affect the
case against Mary Francis Bergamasco.
   Bergamasco, 28, pleaded innocent earlier this week to a charge
of child abuse.
   She was arrested last week when when police found her 7-year-old
son tied to a bench in front of their home.
   Police said a crowd of neighbors had gathered to view the crying
boy. His face was painted blue and a pig's snout fashioned from an
egg carton was taped to his face. A sign hanging on his chest
explained that he was being punished for stealing and lying.
   The boy and his two sisters have been placed in foster homes.
   Reached at Bergamasco's home, her sister, Debbie, said the woman
was not available for comment.
   ``She's on the verge of a nervous breakdown,'' the sister said.
   The woman's first son, 3-month-old Douglas Betts Jr., died April
29, 1977, after suffering a fractured skull, a broken back and
other injuries.
   Lawrence Martin, the Fountain, Colo., police detective who
investigated the case, said the child's father, Douglas Betts,
pleaded guilty Dec. 2, 1977, to charges of second-degree murder.
Betts, at that time a soldier stationed at Fort Carson, Colo.,
served three years in prison.
   Backers said she has informed both county child protective
services and the probation department about the Colorado case.
   ``It may affect her eligibility for counseling'' through a
probationary program, the prosecutor said.

   Pentagon officials said today they are
awaiting results of an official investigation to learn whether U.S.
naval forces in the gulf were monitoring air traffic control
conversations with Iran Air flight 655, communications which Iran
says made clear that the airplane was civilian.
   ``We are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help
clarify the issue,' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   The chief of Iran's air force, Brig. Gen. Mansour Satari, told
reporters in Tehran on Thursday that U.S. systems should have been
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the
jetliner and the airport control tower in Bandar Abbas, near the
mouth of the Persian Gulf.
   Satari also said the downing of the A300 Airbus by the USS
Vincennes showed that the American military was ``unable ... to
control its sophisticated systems.''
   U.S. officials said the Vincennes mistook the Airbus for an
Iranian F-14 fighter because the plane was broadcasting an
identification signal on a frequency used only by military
airplanes, as well as sending a signal on a channel used by both
civilian and military aircraft.
   Satari said destruction of the plane was an ``intentional and
unprovoked attack,'' but he later qualified this by saying the U.S.
military ``accepted on purpose'' the risk of shooting down civilian
planes because they were unable to control their sophisticated
systems.
   And he said Iran had ``all the tapes needed'' to prove that
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down.
   The Iranian general also said the plane was traveling in ``the
center of the international air corridor'' between Bandar Abbas and
Dubai and could have deviated 10 miles either side but still have
been within the corridor.
   On Thursday, the chief Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said that
Defense Department officials ``don't know whether (U.S. forces in
the gulf) were listening to the control tower or not. We will learn
that in the course of the investigation'' being directed by Rear
Adm. William M. Fogarty.
   Tapes from the Vincennes were flown from the gulf for analysis
at a specialized installation at Dahlgren, Va., said Howard. The
tapes contain data from the Vincennes sophisticated Aegis radar and
tracking system, said Howard, but he was unable to say whether they
included voice communications among the ship's officers, U.S.
commanders in the gulf and in the United States, or any intercepted
Iranian transmissions.
   ``It is probable that their highest priority at the moment was
not listening to the air traffic control radio discussions at
Bandar Abbas, said Howard. ``There are many, many radio
frequencies. ... It would take a heck of a lot of people to monitor
all of them.''
   Howard also said that Iranian Air Flight 655 was 4{ miles from
the center of a civilian air corridor stretching from Bandar Abbas
to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates on the opposite side of the
Strait of Hormuz.
   According to the code governing international air flights, said
Howard, ``commercial airliners, those carrying passengers, are
expected to adhere to the centerline of the airway.''
   But he said it was unclear how wide the air corridor was at the
point where the Airbus was hit, because Iran claims a corridor 10
miles on each side and many other countries, including the United
Arab Emirates, recognize a corridor 4{ miles from the center.
   ``The aircraft was at least 4{ miles off the center line of the
airway and in that regard could be considered to be off the normal
track of commercial aircraft,'' said Howard.
   ``An airway is not a safety zone,'' he said. ``All this means is
that within that zone, within that area, the air traffic control
authorities have agreed to track aircraft.''

   A judge Friday convicted 10 men of
manslaughter in connection with a dam collapse in the alpine resort
of Stava that killed 269 people in 1985.
   The 10, who were responsible for running or making periodic
safety checks on the two-basin earthen dam, were sentenced to terms
ranging from 2{ to five years. Two other men were acquitted.
   The upper basin collapsed into the lower basin on July 19, 1985,
sending a flood of water, debris and mud into the valley below. The
torrent swept away three hotels and 20 houses.
   Among those convicted by the Trento Court were Fazio Fiorini, an
official of the Prealpi Mining Co., the owners of the dam, who
proposed building the second reservoir, and Giulio Rota, an owner
of the company.
   The court also ordered the defendants, the provincial government
that approved the project and the companies involved to pay $17
million in damages to the families of the victims.
   Investigators concluded the collapse was caused by negligence.
The team said the dam had been poorly constructed and inadequately
serviced.

   Dr. Jose Carrera could only utter the
names of his missing wife and children before burying his face in
his hands and crying.
   The physician from Matamoros, Mexico, sat outside the
Brownsville Civic Center late Thursday, praying that his wife and
two children had survived the collapse of the Amigo Store.
   A third child, daughter Charlene, 7, was waiting at the store's
entrance when the roof caved in, said Ruth Garcia, a family friend.
   The girl was treated in a San Benito hospital and released early
today. She told her father that her mother, Letty, 37, sister
Denise, 8, brother Israel, 4, and her aunt, Rosalinda Carrera, were
at a cash register paying when the disaster hit.
   Carrera was riding a roller-coaster of emotion, as at one point
this morning it appeared his family had survived.
   ``We believe there is a possibility they are not dead, because
they were in the center, very close to the street, under something
metal,'' said Ms. Garcia, who accompanied Carrera from Matamoros,
just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville.
   ``I feel very happy that they are alive and I hope they can get
them out soon,'' Carrera said this morning.
   But it was not clear, as rescue workers rescued some of those
trapped alive in the wreckage, whether any of the survivors were
members of Carrera's family.
   About 200 people, most from Mexico, had traveled to the quickly
organized Civic Center information area by midnight to learn what
they could about loved ones who might have been caught in the
rubble, said Diana T. Lerma, a Red Cross volunteer.
   ``They've been pretty calm. We are trying to be very cautious,''
Ms. Lerma said.
   For those who were told their families and friends did not
survive, a social worker, nurse and priest were standing by to
help, said the Rev. Mike Scifert, a Catholic priest.
   ``At this point, there is nothing you can say. You just
listen,'' he said. ``One guy was there to fix a leak in the roof,
and the roof fell in on him.''
   The chaos of the accident was worsened by the difficulty
authorities had in getting information to relatives,'' Scifert said.
   ``A lot of people are confused. Many people live in Matamoros
and don't have phones, so there is no way to get in touch with
them,'' he said.
   Selma Torres thought it was a sick joke when a caller telephoned
her lab at Brownsville Medical Center to say the roof had collapsed
at the store, where her mother is a cashier.
   But minutes later, the same woman called again, in tears.
   ``I just took off from the lab,'' Ms. Torres said. ``We drove
all the way as close as we could get until we were four blocks from
there. I ran the rest of the way,'' she said.
   ``Everything was fine until I saw the building and said, `Oh my
God, no one's survived.''
   Ms. Torres and her family were lucky.
   Her mother, Juanita Torres, had escaped with apparently minor
injuries and was back at Brownsville Medical Center being X-rayed.
   Arnold Torres had a chance to talk to his wife briefly before
doctors began examining her.
   ``There were a lot of people shopping at that time because it
was raining. They were shopping, buying umbrellas,'' Torres said
his wife told him.
   Torres heard about the building collapse on the radio and drove
25 minutes to reach the hospital. After phone calls to his daughter
at the medical center, he determined his wife was well. Later, he
saw the rubble.
   ``I'm just glad someone else had told me she was all right
before I saw the building,'' he said. ``Truthfully, I didn't think
there were any survivors.''

   Rebels ambushed and killed three members
of a paramilitary unit in the remote northeastern state of Manipur,
it was reported Friday.
   A soldier and two civilians also were wounded in the Thursday
night assault by underground Naga rebels, the Press Trust of India
said.
   The rebels attacked a jeep of the paramilitary Assam Rifles near
Ukhrul, about 15 miles west of the Burmese border, killing two
officers and a soldier, the agency said.
   It was the third ambush in the past three months blamed on the
National Socialist Council of Nagaland, an outlawed group fighting
for a separate nation for the Naga tribe. At least 20 people have
been killed in the raids.
   Radicals among the Nagas, a tribe of about 800,000, have been
battling for a separate homeland since the 1950s. In 1963, moderate
Nagas accepted the formation of Nagaland as an Indian state, but
radicals have kept up the battle.
   The rebels have underground bases in Nagaland, Manipur and
neighboring Burma. The paramilitary unit from Assam state and the
Indian army have been trying to quash the rebellion.

<HEAD>Briton Pleads Innocent To Trying To Smuggle Helicopters to Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A British airplane broker pleaded innocent today to
federal charges that he tried to smuggle 10 military-type
helicopters to Iran, and federal authorities said his co-defendant
was being sought in Spain.
   Colin Breeze, 33, of Manchester, England, who is being held
without bond, entered the plea before U.S. Magistrate Linnea
Johnson.
   His attorney, public defender Henry Bugay, criticized the
government's case in comments outside court. The two-count
indictment charges Breeze with conspiring to falsify export
documents and soliciting others to provide false information.
   ``It seems awfully weak to me,'' Bugay said. ``The things they
charge him with don't seem very positive.''
   Breeeze's indicted co-defendant, Graham Reavell, is being sought
in Spain under a federal arrest warrant, according to a source in
the U.S. attorney's office who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, the source said that even if Reavell were located, it
was not clear that he could be extradited under the U.S.-Spain
treaty, which may not cover the crimes he was indicted for in Miami.
   Reavell is also believed to be a British subject.
   The two defendants face a maximum sentence on each of the two
counts of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The two men are accused of attempting to re-export 10 Sikorsky
S-76 helicopters now in Jordan to Iran.
   The helicopters, which are ideal for transporting troops under
desert conditions, had been sold by Sikorsky to the Jordanian air
force, U.S. Customs Service officials said. Some were traded back
to the company, but all remained in Jordan and were eventually put
on sale for a total of $6.8 million.
   Breeze, who was arrested June 21 in Fort Lauderdale, allegedly
made arrangements through Iran's ambassador to Spain to sell the
helicopters for $30 million to an Iranian-owned European company,
according to Miami Customs head Patrick O'Brien.
   Other co-conspirators are referred to in the indictment but not
named, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric A. Dubelier, who is
prosecuting the case.

   A train crossing a bridge derailed today
and plunged six passenger cars into a lake and left three dangling
from the overpass. Officials said 85 people died and 200 were
missing.
   About 500 people were taken to nearby hospitals, said officials
in the towns of Quilon and Trivandrum, in southern India.
   Hospital officials in Quilon said 75 victims were admitted there
and 25 others in serious condition were rushed by ambulance to a
larger hospital in Trivandrum, about 30 miles away. The officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rest were treated and
released.
   The accident occurred as the 14-car Island Express was crossing
a bridge near Quilon in the state of Kerala, police in Trivandrum
said. Police said the accident occurred at 1:15 p.m.
   Chief Constable Vellu Kutty in Quilon said the dead included 60
men, 20 women and five children.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   Three of the passenger cars were submerged in water 20 to 30
feet deep, said I.K. Chari, a spokesman for the Indian Railways
Ministry. Three others were partly under water, he said.
   He said the engine, the second car and cars at the train's rear
were hanging from the track.
   Divers from a nearby Indian Navy base were flown in by
helicopter to help in rescue operations. Firefighters from several
towns were sent to help cut through the carriages.
   The United News of India said villagers, some in small boats,
rescued about 100 people from the water immediately after the crash.
   Dr. Thomas Verghese, deputy director of Quilon district hospital
about six miles from the accident site, told The Associated Press
by telephone that 65 bodies had been recovered.
   He said police had told hospital officials to expect more
victims.
   ``Two or three cars still are under water so a minimum of 200
people have yet to be accounted for,'' he said.
   The derailing occurred during the monsoon season of heavy rain,
and the downpour in Kerala is reported to be the worst in years.
   UNI said the south-bound train derailed while crossing a bridge
spanning Ashtamudi Lake. The train was en route to Trivandrum from
Bangalore, the capital of neighboring Karnataka state, it said.
   Railroads remain the major form of both short- and long-distance
travel in India. An average of 11,800 trains run daily in the
country, carrying about 9 million passengers over a network that
has 38,347 miles of rail lines.
   The system is plagued by minor accidents.
   The Railway Ministry announced in February that 227 people were
killed in 613 train accidents during 1987.
   One July 9, 1987, a train was caught in a flash flood near the
town of Kazipet in Arunachal Pradesh state in southern India.
Fifty-three were killed.
   The Press Trust of India said the worst rail accident in the
country claimed more than 300 lives in Bihar state on June 6, 1981.

   A gasoline storage tank collapsed and
caught fire as a heavy thunderstorm passed over an oil refinery,
authorities said today.
   No injuries were reported in the Thursday evening collapse of
the 80,000 gallon tank, which contained unleaded gasoline, said the
Hutchinson County sheriff's office.
   ``The water from the rain caused the roof to sink into the
gasoline,'' said Phillips Petroleum Co. spokesman Dan Harrison. The
roof rises and falls with the volume of gasoline inside.
   ``We began applying foam to seal the roof and, during the
application of foam, the fire broke out.''
   Harrison said about 50,000 to 55,000 gallons of foam was inside
the tank when fire broke out. The flames were extinguished, but the
gas reignited early this morning, he said.
   ``They have a large tank, containing unleaded gas, burning,''
said a sheriff's officer who declined to be identified. ``It looks
like they will have to wait until it burns itself out.''
   Two access roads to the refinery were closed, the officer said.
Plant workers were using foam and water to fight the blaze.
   Phillips is 55 miles northeast of Amarillo in the Texas
Panhandle.

   Rodney Morris insisted he'd been arrested on
a robbery charge and shouldn't be on trial for allegedly tampering
with a car.
   But Municipal Judge Thomas J. McCormack convicted him of theft
and conspiracy charges anyway.
   McCormack said he figured if the wrong Rodney Morris had really
been brought in for trial Thursday, his lawyer, William J. Hagan,
would speak up.
   A police officer identified Morris as one of three men who had
been tampering with a car last January. When the defense opened,
Morris refused to take the stand because he said, ``This is not my
case. What can I say?''
   ``Guilty,'' the judge said.
   ``I was never arrested in this case,'' Morris said as McCormack
was about to impose sentence. ``I'm not the real guy. I'm charged
with robbery, not this.''
   The judge asked Hagan if Morris was his client. Hagan said he
wasn't sure.
   Records were checked, the prison was called and sure enough, the
wrong Rodney Morris had been brought to court.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' the judge said. ``I withdrew my
verdict.''

   A barn that housed 2,000 rabbits and 2,000
guinea pigs being grown for research was burned, killing all the
animals, authorities said.
   The fire Thursday also destroyed the barn.
   Gerald Kuiper, owner of Kuiper Rabbit Ranch, said he and a
worker were cleaning the barn when they noticed some hay on fire.
   ``I tried to grab a hose to put it out. Everything was filled
with smoke, and it just started to go up in flames. It just seem
seemed to start on its own,'' said a tearful Kuiper. ``I don't know
what I am going to do now.''
   Kuiper, who has raised animals at the farm for 26 years,
estimated his loss at $100,000. But he said he has other barns
where he raises animals. The animals are sold, for $3 to $10, to
laboratories around the Midwest.
   Officials were investigating a cause for the blaze.

   A judge agreed to lower the bond of a man accused
of robbery on condition that he marry his common-law wife and
attend church.
   State District Judge Carl Walker dropped Zachery Ellis' bond
from $20,000 to $10,000 and told him he must marry Shawnita
Jackson, 18, if his family can raise the money.
   Walker has taken the action in other cases involving unmarried
people who have children. Ellis is the father of two of Ms.
Jackson's children, ages 2 and 7 months, the judge said.
   ``It's a Walker policy,'' the judge said later. ``If you can
father the child, you ought to legitimize the child.''
   There was no indication during the proceedings Thursday whether
Ellis and Ms. Jackson intend to wed, or if the money can be raised
for the bond. But attorney Brian Fischer said he wasn't offended by
the judge's condition.
   ``It's a good policy,'' Fischer said. ``I'm not saying it's
enforceable _ it's not _ but my client's been in jail for seven
months.''

   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter entered Cuban waters
early Friday to rescue a man whose powerless sailboat was drifting
toward Cuba, a spokesman said.
   ``We notified them that we were going in. We don't do it very
often ... every year or so,'' Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson said, adding
that the Cuban government made no objection to the rescue about 10
miles northwest of the island.
   The agency had picked up an emergency signal Thursday night, and
suspected it might be coming from the 30-foot ``My Love III,''
Simpson said.
   Earlier, Coast Guard personnel had given a charge to the boat's
weak batteries and it sailed away.
   Officers found the My Love III, its batteries again dead, and
began towing it to Key West, Simpson said. The name of the sailor,
a U.S. citizen, was not released.

   A senior intelligence officer convicted

Friday to death by hanging.
   Paul Mapurisa, 43, a senior officer in the Central Intelligence
Organization, was convicted of murder for the Jan. 30, 1987
shooting of Herbert Nyamukondiwa.
   The high court found that Mapurisa, who was attached to
president Robert Mugabe's close security unit, fired 14 pistol
shots at Nyamukondiwa, 34, in the Harare suburb of Hatfield.
   The court ruled that the motorist's death had ``a keenly

   Two reporters for the Providence Journal-Bulletin
are investigating the death last year of their publisher, even
though police concluded after a five-month investigation that the
death was accidental.
   Michael P. Metcalf, 54, who also was chief executive officer of
the Providence Journal Co., was found last Sept. 13 unconscious
with head injuries next to his bicycle in Westport, Mass.
   He never regained consciousness and died a week later at St.
Mary's Hospital in Fall River.
   Westport police said the death was accidental.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina agreed to conduct
another investigation at the request of the Providence Journal Co.
His office and state police ended a five-month investigation last
February and came to the same conclusion, although Pina said the
case officially remains open.
   But reporters G. Wayne Miller and Robert Kramer began their
investigation in March and will continue as they think necessary.
   ``We decided there were enough nagging doubts, even after the
Pina investigation, that it would be wrong for us to just sit back
and not do anything, especially about something that was so
mysterious and touched so close to home,'' Carol Young, metro
managing editor of the Journal, told The Boston Globe this week.
   ``We didn't want to wake up two years from now knowing we hadn't
tested it,'' she said.
   Many rumors circulated following Metcalf's death, and Miller
told the Globe: ``Virtually all of them had something to do with
something other than a freak accident.''
   He said the rumors included theories that Metcalf was tripped by
an animal, knocked down by a hit-run driver, or murdered by
gangsters.
   Police estimated Metcalf was cycling at 20 mph, but doctors said
they were surprised he suffered such massive injuries at that speed.
   Steven Hamblett, who succeeded Metcalf as publisher, and
Metcalf's widow, Charlotte Metcalf, said they were not satisfied
with the outcome of the police investigation.
   ``We cannot forget that Mr. Metcalf was publisher of newspapers
known for their investigative stories and editorials on crime,''
Hamblett said. ``This fact, coupled with the unique circumstances
surrounding his death, make it impossible for us to rule out foul
play.''
   Pina said he would welcome new evidence but stood by the
conclusion his office reached.
   ``We don't know why he fell off his bicycle, but the evidence we
have is consistent with the fact that he fell off his bike, hit the
ground with his full body weight on the skull and fractured it,''
Pina said. ``It's a freakish accident, but it can occur....''
   The reporters sent more than 1,000 letters to people who may
have been in the area the morning of the accident, including
participants in a 100-mile bike rally on a route that passed the
spot where Metcalf fell.
   Miller declined to comment on what, if anything, the reporters
have learned so far.
   Metcalf had been publisher of the newspapers since 1979. His
father and his grandfather had been president of the company before
him.

<TEXT>
   Hungarian trade unions want parliament
to pass a law giving them the right to strike, it was reported
Friday.
   Such a law would make Hungary the first Soviet bloc country in
which strikes would be a legitimate form of worker protest.
   Current law makes a vague reference to the right to ``work
stoppage,'' but strikes virtually are illegal in Hungary.
   The state news agency MTI quoted Sandor Nagy, general secretary
of the Hungrian Trade Union Council, as saying parliament should
pass a trade union law ``with due stipulations ... about the right
to strike and the conditions of taking that industrial action.''
The next parliamentary session is in September.
   Nagy was elected to the post in June as part of the Communist
Party and government reshuffle. The moves followed a party
conference in May at which Karoly Grosz replaced longtime party
leader Janos Kadar.
   For decades, strikes were officially non-existent in Communist
Eastern Europe, and the goverments' official line was that they
were unnecessary because workers are the owners of factories under
Marxist doctrine.
   Strikes have occurred recently, however, in the Soviet Union,
Poland and Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   Japan decided Friday to lower by 4.6 percent the
price paid to farmers for this year's rice crop, government
officials said.
   The Cabinet decision marks a second consecutive decline in the
producer rice price, which determines consumer rice prices as well.
Japanese customers now pay up to eight times the price paid for
rice in other countries.
   The government postponed for one year a new method to calculate
the producer rice price. Under the new price, producers will
receive $127 for every 132 pounds of rice.
   After going through Japan's complex distribution system, rice
costs about $4 a pound.
   Analysts pointed to excess rice production in the past few years
and the declining consumption as reasons for the price decline.
More than 1.8 million tons of rice are stockpiled.
   ``Excess production is the direct motivation to lower the
price,'' said Masatsune Adachi, an agricultural analyst.
   ``But the bottom line is the appreciation of the yen. The
Agricultural Ministry wants Japanese rice production competitive
enough to endure foreign competition in case foreign demands to
open the market is extended to rice,'' Adachi said.
   Rice is Japan's top agricultural product. The government
controls distribution by buying rice from farmers and releasing it
to the market. The country also bans the importation of rice.
   Japan has been under strong pressure from the United States to
open its agricultural markets, including rice.
   The government's decision to delay the introduction of the new
method is widely attributed to the strong political influence of
the farm lobby.
   Recent agreements with the United States to open Japanese
markets are expected to have a severe impact on Japanese farmers.
Tokyo has promised to open its agricultural markets to American
beef and oranges, which are considerably cheaper than domestic beef
and oranges.

   A department store manager has been fired
after company officials accused her of writing a ``racially
derogatory'' memo telling employees to turn away any black
customers attempting to return bed linen.
   Marshall's department store executives also issued a public
apology to Cynthia Sterling, 24, who said she saw the memo at a
checkout stand.
   Sterling, who is black, was trying to return a comforter. A
store employee showed her the memo and walked away.
   It read: ``If any black person returns any sheet sets, refuse a
cash voucher or exchange or credit for any reason.''
   Company spokeswoman Jane Maxwell said the memo was written after
a linen sale.
   In a statement, the company said store manager Eva Vidal
``independently issued a racially derogatory memo'' that ``in no
way reflects the belief, attitudes, or policies'' of the company.
It said Vidal's employment had been ``terminated.''
   Sterling said she had ``a 4-year-old girl who has not stopped
saying, `Why can't we do this, mama, because we're black?' It was
very hard to explain to her that I couldn't do something because I
was black.''
   Efforts to reach Vidal were unavailing. She did not return
telephone messages left on an answering machine.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk today accused
Vice President George Bush of improperly using taxpayers' money to
finance campaign travel or exceeding legal spending limits.
   In a letter to White House counsel A.B. Culvahouse, Kirk said
evidence ``strongly suggests'' improper spending. Kirk told
reporters in Atlanta the Democratic Party may file a complaint with
the Federal Election Commission, which enforces federal election
laws.
   ``The only thing that matches the hypocrisy of the Republican
Party of the 1980s claiming the party of fiscal conservatism is the
Republican Party of the 1980s preaching about law and order,'' Kirk
said.
   Kirk said Bush may have used tax money improperly to pay for
some campaign expenses.
   But, he said, even if the Bush campaign reimburses the
government for trips the vice president made, including appearances
in Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio, he would question whether
the campaign has exceeded the spending limit for the pre-convention
period.
   In the letter, delivered today, Kirk said Bush ``is conserving
his limited remaining resources'' by not reimbursing the federal
government for the use of Air Force Two and other vice presidential
perks during two June political trips.
   He asked Culvahouse to ``take immediate action'' on the
allegations.
   Federal law says the government will pay the vice president's
expenses only ``in the discharge of executive duties and
responsibilities,'' but interpretation of those duties is up to the
Federal Election Commission.
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said the Louisville trip and
another one-day outing to Columbus, Ohio, cited by Kirk will be
paid for fully by the Bush campaign.
   ``It was a campaign expenditure,'' Goodin said. ``The bill
hasn't been paid, but when it's paid the campaign will pay it.'' He
said the determination that the trips were campaign trips was made
well in advance of Kirk's letter.
   Today in Washington, Bush campaign chairman Lee Atwater said
Kirk's statements ``are totally without merit and are obviously
designed to distract public attention from the real issues. ...
While I have not yet seen Kirk's letter, the events I am told he
questioned were financed in accordanace with the law, and in no
case were public funds used to defray either campaign or Republican
National Committee expenses associated with trips.''
   Atwater added, ``Mr. Kirk is wrong on the facts, and I challenge
him to come forward with something more than political innuendo if
he wants to level accusations against this campaign.''
   Bush has been forced to limit his campaign travel because he has
spent nearly all the money allowed under federal election law for
the pre-convention campaign. But he has taken several trips billed
as party-building events at the expense of the RNC.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House is
``scrupulously careful in determining who pays for political
activities. This sounds like more political hot air to me.''

   Thirteen farmers died after they went into
wells contaminated with carbon dioxide, a government official said
today.
   Kartar Singh Bhoria, deputy commissioner in Karnal in the
northern state of Haryana, said the deaths occurred Thursday and
today in six villages near Karnal.
   He said all of the farmers were stricken after they climbed into
the wells to start up underground pumps for irrigating rice
paddies. Tests showed the wells to be filled with carbon dioxide,
he said.
   The colorless and odorless gas was believed formed underground
because of radical climate changes over the past year. Last year
the region suffered severe drought.
   Karnal is 72 miles north of New Delhi.
   The Press Trust of India said other villages were warned of
possible danger.
   Government officials urged farmers to lower burning candles or
lamps into the well to check for gas before entering the wells
themselves. The flame will be extinguished if carbon dioxide gas is
present, they said.

<HEAD>Mount Rushmore Reopened After Fire Burns 13,000 Acres</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 23rd graf, `Firefighters gained ...,' to CORRECT that
Shoshone fire contained, not controlled.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters beat back a forest fire that prompted the
evacuation of more than 1,000 people near Mount Rushmore National
Memorial, allowing it to be reopened, while a second blaze nearly
brushed the Alaska Pipeline.
   In South Carolina, a 1,000-acre blaze jumped plowed fire lines
in four locations Thursday and ate up another 150 acres of timber
and brush dried by heat and drought, while land managers in Alaska
took a new tack in their battle against four fires raging over
270,000 acres.
   Fifty percent of South Dakota's Custer State Park fire, which
has burned 16,000 acres, was contained by Thursday night, said fire
information officer Jerry Hagen.
   ``We have 13 miles of fire line built at this point. We have 13
miles to go,'' Hagen said. ``We expect to have the rest of it
contained by 8 p.m. Sunday.''
   The weather was finally working on the side of the firefighters.
Instead of searing temperatures, high wind and low humidity, crews
this morning faced temperatures in the 60s, higher humidity and
light southeasterly winds at 6-10 mph, said Richard Homann, a
spokesman for the state Division of forestry.
   Although authorities today revised the number of acres upward
from Thursday's figure of 13,000, the fire didn't really grow that
much overnight, said Tom Farver, a public information officer with
the state Division of Forestry. He said officials used an infrared
scanner in an airplane Thursday to get a more accurate reading of
the acreage as well as pinpoint hotspots.
   About 1,000 people in or near the park, the town of Keystone and
Mount Rushmore were evacuated Wednesday night as the fire in the
Black Hills National Forest spread northward, but a wind shift
stopped the flames short of the granite monument of four presidents.
   Crews today planned to strengthen the fire lines on the west
edge and southwest perimeter of the blaze, Homann said.
   On Thursday, fire commander Bob Miller said, ``The objective
today was to keep the fire from spreading to the north toward Mount
Rushmore. That was accomplished.''
   ``With the exception of the facilities in Custer State Park the
Black Hills are open,'' said park superintendent Dan Wenk. ``The
fire is in a very small area of the Black Hills.''
   Mount Rushmore and Keystone were reopened Thursday, but Custer
State Park remained off-limits. The fire was four miles east of
Custer today, and Homann said an evacuation plan has been drawn up
for the town.
   The cost to fight the fire thus far is $361,000, and it could
cost $1 million when all the expenses are tallied, Homann said.
   In South Carolina, timberland near Nixonville defied
firefighters by jumping their lines.
   ``If we can get a good, wide break established tonight,
hopefully that'll take care of it,'' said firefighter Mike Remion
Thursday night.
   Instead of using water, firefighters plow up large fire breaks
to starve the fire and stop its spread.
   ``We can keep it under control but it won't actually be out
until we get some rain ... not just a little rain, but a lot of
rain,'' said forestry spokeswoman Jennie Morris.
   In Alaska, firefighters held a blaze in check that had come
within 10 miles of the Alaska Pipeline while land managers altered
their overall strategy because of debilitating smoke.
   ``Their goal has been to stop the fire from getting closer to
the pipeline,'' said Sue Mitchell, an information officer for the
Bureau of Land Management. ``So far, they seem to have been
successful. They have the head of the fire corraled between two
creeks and a fire line.''
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. spokesman Tom Brennan said the
pipeline stands in a large, cleared right-of-way, is constructed of
thick steel that has been heavily insulated, and was not
susceptible to serious damage even if the fire had reached it.
   Northern Alaska's major fires are a 126,000-acre blaze 15 miles
north of Livengood; a 40,000-acre fire near Ambler; a 53,000-acre
fire northeast of Fort Yukon; and a 51,000-acre fire north of
Central. All but the last are manned. More than 600 firefighters
are on the job.
   Elsewhere in a nation made fire-prone by drought and heat:
   _ Low winds and cooler temperatures helped to bring under
control today a 1,300-acre fire ignited by fireworks in Wyoming's
Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   _ Firefighters contained a 1,650-acre fire in Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest, said incident commander ``Tut'' Anderson. The fire
was started by lightning two weeks ago.
   _ In Yellowstone National Park, three fires covering nearly
1,900 acres of backcountry were being allowed to burn themselves
out.
   _ A 920-acre brush fire in the Los Padres National Forest in
California was nearly encircled Thursday as firefighters made
progress against the slow-moving but stubborn blaze.
   _ Firefighters gained the upper hand Thursday on Utah brush and
range fires that charred more than 5,000 acres in three separate
areas, including 900 acres in Zion National Park.

<HEAD>`Flipper' Trainer Heading For China To Save Endangered River
Dolphins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American who trained dolphins for the
television series ``Flipper'' said he is leaving for China on
Saturday to try to save endangered river dolphins from extinction.
   Ric O'Barry, who has been working with dolphins for 25 years,
said only about 300 freshwater dolphins, or ``baiji,'' remain in
the polluted Yangtze River.
   ``The problem is that 10 percent of the world's population lives
along that river,'' he said in an interview from Hong Kong, where
he arrived Monday from the United States.
   ``It's not a traditional pollution problem involving chemical
waste but animal and human waste,'' O'Barry said.
   The Chinese plan to block off a loop in the Yangtze for a
dolphin preserve. But he said this might not be the solution
because of the Yangtze's pollution.
   O'Barry would like to move the dolphins to Taihu, a lake near
Nanjing on the Yangtze in southeastern China. He believes this
might be the only way to save them from extinction.
   The survival of the river dolphins, he said, ``is not a Chinese
problem but a world problem, a human problem.''
   O'Barry, 48, decided to go to China after a meeting in Miami
with Zhou Kaiya, dean of the Nanjing Normal University, when he
heard about the problems facing the river dolphins.
   He borrowed $3,000 from his 16-year-old son's college fund for
the trip but said he also is looking for corporate sponsorship for
the project.
   ``I don't have a lot of money but I have lots of patience _
that's a necessary tool,'' O'Barry said.
   After arriving in Hong Kong, O'Barry tried to telephone Zhou in
Nanjing, but ``they ... said they had no Dr. Zhou there.''
   Fearing failure in his mission, O'Barry contacted officials of
the World Wildlife Fund in Hong Kong and the conservationist
organization tracked down Zhou.
   From Nanjing, O'Barry plans to take a boat down the Yangtze
River to the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan to see Qi Qi, an
8-foot, bluish grey male dolphin, the only Chinese river dolphin in
captivity.
   As a trainer at Miami's Seaquarium in the 1960s, O'Barry taught
five dolphins to play the part of Flipper on TV.

   The voters want major changes in the nation's
direction but may face a presidential campaign based more on the
personalities of Michael Dukakis and George Bush, a new poll
suggested Friday.
   The Democratic governor of Massachusetts, apparently riding the
desire for change, holds a nine-point lead over Bush in the latest
poll conducted by Hamilton, Frederick and Schneiders, a Washington
survey firm.
   However, Charles Rund, a Republican consultant on the poll,
said, ``Americans are moving faster than their political leadership
is. We may be in for the biggest personality contest _ because of a
lack of big issues _ that we've ever seen.''
   The poll, conducted for the American Medical Political Action
Committee, also suggested that both parties are suffering from the
``sleaze factor,'' a perception of unethical conduct by the
nation's leaders.
   Recent national surveys have put Dukakis' margin over Bush in
single digits, down from a wave of polls giving him double-digit
margins earlier in the spring. The new survey gave Dukakis support
of 50 percent and Bush 41 percent. Nine percent were undecided in
the telephone interviews with 1,502 registered voters June 8-19.
The sampling error for such a survey is three percentage points in
either direction.
   Change is the major thought on the voters' minds, the poll
suggested.
   ``The need for change is driving this election,'' said pollster
William Hamilton. ``They want change but they don't want a
revolution.''
   By a 60-32 margin, those polled agreed that the next president
should ``make major changes ... and set new goals and directions
for the country.'' By a similar 61-31 edge, the registered voters
agreed they want the next president to initiate new economic
policies.
   And Dukakis does best among those who want change the most, the
poll said.
   For example, among respondents who took the strongest pro-change
stance on both questions, Dukakis led Bush 73-19. Among those
taking the strongest pro-status quo position, the result was
reversed, with Bush leading 78-13.
   While the drive for change is broad-based, it is not focused on
specific issues.
   Thirty-five percent named issues closely linking the government
and the economy _ such as the budget deficit and trade deficit _ as
the most critical. That complex of issues was followed closely by
social concerns such as AIDS, the homeless and medical care,
totaling 33 percent.
   Twenty-nine percent mentioned foreign policy and defense matters
and 26 percent talked about drugs and crime. Another 26 percent
cited unemployment and inflation. Respondents were allowed to name
more than one issue.
   The poll said, as others have, that Bush is viewed negatively by
many voters, while Dukakis is not clearly perceived yet by the
public.
   ``Bush has to get Michael Dukakis as a personality into this
race with some negatives on him,'' Hamilton said.
   Voters gave Bush a 53 percent positive rating, but a substantial
42 percent negative one. In contrast, Dukakis drew favorable marks
from 66 percent to only 23 percent unfavorable.
   Democratic strategists have been saying that Bush and
Republicans generally will be damaged in the fall elections by the
sleaze factor _ allegations of wrongdoing and unethical behavior by
Reagan appointees. Bush has been fighting back by pointing to the
investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright's finances.
   The poll suggested that it is losing issue for both parties.
   ``It's tarring everyone,'' Hamilton said.
   Two-thirds of those questioned said the leaders of business,
government and religious groups are less trustworthy and honest
than they were 10 or 15 years ago, up from 58 percent in a poll
taken in July 1987. In both polls, about one out of ten said the
leaders are more honest than they were.

   A federal judge today rejected a newspaper's
attempt to obtain secret applications for warrants to search and
wiretap the offices of defense consultants under investigation for
alleged procurement fraud.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt denied a request by The
Washington Times to unseal applications for the searches and
wiretaps that he had authorized in the nation's capital.
   Pratt ruled there was a compelling public interest to keep the
material secret until the investigation into contract fraud
proceeds further along.
   Asistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica argued at a hearing that
the Justice Department was seeking to keep the documents under seal
``only for a limited time to permit major steps'' in the
investigation.
   ``We don't have any great dispute for the public's right to
know, what we are saying now is not the appopriate time for that,''
Aronica said.
   Pratt agreed, saying:
   ``All this material is going to be in the public domain in the
reasonably near future. There is no denial of the public right to
know. What we do deny is when that right to know is to be
effective.''
   Jerome Barron, a George Washington University law professor who
represented the newspaper, said the Times had both a common-law and
First Amendment right to obtain the affidavits.
   Barron argued there was a compelling public interest to obtain
information about the contract-fraud investigation. He noted that
the release of an affidavit in Dallas prompted Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci to freeze payment on a number of defense contracts
that might be tainted.
   The Washington Times suit was among several filed by a number of
newspapers in several cities. The Times has another action pending
in Alexandria, Va., where the investigation is based and the
largest number of sealed affidavits located.
   On Wednesday, the Washington Post made a similar request in
Hyattsville, Md., while the St. Louis Post-Dispatch applied for
unsealing in St. Louis.
   Newsday, published in Long Island, N.Y., and New York City,
filed in Brooklyn June 23.
   The Washington Post cited ``a strong public interest'' in
unsealing the documents supporting three searches in Maryland. A
hearing is scheduled for next week.
   The Post said the papers were sealed, presumably because
disclosure originally would have impaired the investigation. But,
said the application, ``these interests, no doubt well-founded in
the first instance, cannot justify secrecy for an unlimited period
of time.''
   Said the Post: ``It is hardly a secret any more that the
government is conducting a wide-ranging probe of defense
procurement practices.''
   The Pulitzer Publishing Co., which publishes the Post-Dispatch,
seeks information about a search of the offices of Thomas Gunn, the
vice president for marketing of McDonnell Aircraft Co., a
subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The newspaper claims constitutional guarantees of freedom of the
press give it the right of ``immediate access'' to the affidavits.
   U.S. District Judge Clyde S. Cahill in St. Louis issued a search
warrant June 14, authorizing the FBI to seize documents and
computer records related to the work of two consultants, Melvyn R.
Paisley and James A. ``Ace'' Lyons, who have worked for McDonnell.
   Paisley is one of the major targets of the FBI's nationwide
investigation into defense purchases, an investigation called
``Operation Ill Wind.'' He was the Navy's assistant secretary for
research, engineering and systems from 1981 to last year.
   Paisley's application to inspect the application for the warrant
FBI agents obtained to search the office of Paisley Associates,
Inc. was denied during a hearing before Pratt.
   The judge told Paisley's lawyer the application was merely ``an
attempt on your part to find out information the government has
with respect to your client.''
   Pratt, who had originally scheduled a closed proceeding on
Paisley's motion, held the hearing in open court.
   In St. Louis, McDonnell Douglas, an aerospace giant, has denied
any wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate with the Pentagon
probe.
   Cahill allowed the search warrant and the inventory of material
seized in the search to be made public, but he agreed to a request
by prosecutors that the affidavits in support of the warrant remain
sealed indefinitely.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Wednesday that it opposed the
publishing company's request. Release of the affidavits would
disclose classified information and harm national security,
prosecutors said.
   James R. Reed, a corporate spokesman for McDonnell, said the
company had not seen the affidavit but wanted to discuss its
contents with the government before any consideration of its
release.
   Cahill gave prosecutors until Monday and McDonnell Douglas until
Tuesday to respond to the request for disclosure; he said he hoped
to rule by July 18.
   Meanwhile, Judge Pratt in Washington unsealed portions of
affidavits the FBI submitted to search the offices of United
Technologies executive Eugene Tallia and defense consultant William
Galvin last month.
   The unsealed portions do not shed any new light on the
government's continuing investigation. The passages, which the
government did not object to being released, merely describe in
general terms the Pentagon procurement system and the role of
defense contractors.
   Pratt refused a request by United Technologies to review the
rest of the affidavits' contents.

   The death toll from a six-day heat wave
rose to 31 on Friday and officials said 111-degree temperatures
sent more than 3,000 people to hospitals.
   The government ordered Athens' 100 biggest factories to reduce
their emissions output by 30 percent to cope with high smog levels
over the city.
   Hospitals nationwide remained on alert to handle smog and heat
wave victims. The National Weather Service said the temperature in
Athens reached 111 degrees Fahrenheit at 3 p.m.
   ``The temperature will remain much the same tomorrow amd we're
expecting it to start dropping on Sunday,'' said a weather service
spokeswoman.
   The National Center for Emergency Help said 3,143 people went to
hospital outpatient clincs with heat related problems and 558 were
hospitalized, most of them with heart and breathing problems.
   A spokesman for the center said six people died of heat stroke
overnight. Coroner Nikos Benardis reported another 10 heat-related
deaths, bringing the total for the past five days to 31.
   ``Three of them were in their 80s and died of heart failure due
to dehydration, while the others had chronic illnesses that were
agggravated by the heat,'' Benardis told The Associated Press.
   The soaring temperatures also forced several hundred people to
seek refuge at a 15,000-seat, air-conditioned indoor sports stadium
in Athens' port city of Piraeus.
   ``Many of them are pregnant women or couples with infants. There
are some elederly people as well. They're coming in steadily,''
said Panayiotis Kontozamanis, the stadium's director.
   Government anti-pollution measures have failed to eliminate a
brown smog mass that has plagued the city for years. Known as the
nefos, the Greek word for cloud, the smog mass forms in the lower
atmosphere on warm, still days.

   ``The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'' mixes
dancing with the slow motion of some Oriental theater and with the
gestures Martha Graham uses to denote passions.
   Unfortunately, it doesn't mix them enough. Before the 3{ hours
are over, a viewer loses interest and becomes restless.
   The slow-motion tableaux are interesting at first, slowing a
viewer into serenity. The best of ``Saint Sebastian'' is the
dancing, but that frequently stops and, with narration in French,
the story is tediously acted out. Martha Graham has her dancers
gesture while dancing, sustaining tension.
   Robert Wilson, known for creating long operas along with modern
composers, has created a long ballet, his first, with Japanese
classical dancer Suzushi Hanayagi.
   The Paris Opera Ballet, which premiered it in March, is ending
its three-week Metropolitan Opera season this weekend with the
American premiere of the work.
   ``The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'' is beautiful. The final
scene is Paradise _ white grass, bears and monkeys with a
breathtaking bright white light. Costumes and sets are wonderful,
with large, striking images, like the lily which comes from above,
filling the backdrop as its petals open.
   Sylvie Guillem was always marvelous to look at as Saint
Sebastian. She is lovely and has total muscle control and grace.
When she stood in front of a pillar, in white sarong, to be shot by
arrows, it was the pose of a 1930s Hollywood star. But Miss Guillem
was so convincing as Saint Sebastian that nobody snickered.
   When Patrick Dupond, as the emperor, danced, he looked splendid.
Michael Denard was effective as a second Saint Sebastian.
   Program notes were extensive enough to make everything clear.
The text was written for a five-hour ballet in 1911. Claude Debussy
composed the music.
   Wilson wrote a 20th century prologue, directed and collaborated
on sets and lighting.
   The small amount of dancing in ``Saint Sebastian,'' however,
reminds one of the claim made for some great voices that they would
be fascinating reading the entire phone book. It's best not to put
that to the test.

   Rescuers digging through tons of
concrete and twisted steel for the victims of a department store
collapse today rescued six people and worked to free others
believed alive. At least 11 people were killed and 47 injured.
   Two women, a 2-year-old girl, a boy and girl both aged 8, and a
14-year-old girl were rescued during the morning. At least one
survivor was still trapped more than 20 hours after the disaster,
officials said.
   The 2-year-old ``appeared to have been protected by some other
people around her who are believed dead,'' said Lt. Victor
Rodriguez of the city's police department.
   Another rescued child, 8-year-old Jorge Mena Lire, was pulled
from the rubble and taken on a stretcher to be examined by waiting
doctors.
   ``The little boy kept crying that he wanted to come out. He was
scared and he wanted a little ball and he wanted some
refreshments,'' said fireman William Briggs. ``He was also a little
scared, which is natural, and he's also afraid of dying.''
   The three-story Amigo Store collapsed Thursday afternoon during
a storm that dumped more than 2 inches of rain in less than 30
minutes. Some witnesses said as many as 125 people sought shelter
inside the downtown building before it crumbled, but Sgt. Dean
Poos, a police spokesman, said only about 50 had been inside.
   There was continuing confusion over the numbers and identities
of people in the building. Officials first said that the wife and
two children of Dr. Jose Carrera were alive in the rubble; later in
the morning they were less certain.
   Hundreds of rescuers working through the night removed debris
with tractors, a crane and finally by hand, fearful of further
injuring trapped survivors. Working through the night under
portable floodlights, they used dogs and sensitive microphones to
hunt for victims.
   Later in the morning, hundreds of onlookers cheered as one woman
was carried to safety and taken to a first aid station across the
st
believed one of the victims scribbled the message.
   To reach trapped survivors, rescuers dug a makeshift 17-foot
tunnel, and doctors were able to check their vital signs, said
Johnny Economedes, head of one rescue team.
   ``It's very hard for them. They are in terrible pain, both
emotional and physical,'' he said.
   Further rescues of survivors could take hours, said Poos.
   One of those saved was a 14-year-old girl who was wedged between
two concrete slabs. ``Every time there's movement, the slabs hit
her in the head,'' said Pamela Downing of the city's public
utilities board before she was freed.
   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza said: ``I think they (the people
who are still trapped) have been panicked; they have been afraid.
We have had some priests in there talking to them.
   ``Now that we're to them, we're able to get them through it. I
think we have an IV in one or two of them. So I think they're being
calming down now but obviously they want to get out of there and
we're making every effort to get them out of there as fast as
possible.''
   The store was half a block from the international bridge across
the Rio Grande River to Matamoros, Mexico. When the storm began, a
large number of Mexican nationals ``were running there to get out
of the rain. The store was packed,'' sheriff's Lt. Johnny Castillo
said.
   A woman sitting in a car in front of the store was among those
killed when the roof and walls collapsed.
   Rescuers cut through a wall inside a Woolworth's store next door
to reach some of those trapped. Linens and clothing blown from the
store by high winds were used to wrap the wounds of the injured.
   Six bodies had been removed from the rubble by midnight, and
Poos said two more were removed this morning. Officials said three
others were still in the wreckage.
   ``They've got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30
tons of concrete'' on them, Economedes said. Authorities fear that
dozens of people may still be trapped.
   Ambulances, firefighters and volunteers from across the Rio
Grande Valley joined the rescue effort and numerous companies
provided heavy machinery.
   ``There are so many helping hands that it's too much once you
look at it,'' said City Commissioner Harry McNair. ``Brownsville
hasn't seen a disaster of this magnitude since 1967 with Hurricane
Beulah.''
   Many people went to blood banks to donate blood in case it was
needed.
   As of noon today, 47 people were known to be injured, Rodriguez
said. At least eight of the injured were admitted to hospitals; 34
others were treated and released, Poos said earlier.
   Among those injured slightly was store owner Bernard Levin, 67,
who was working at the cash register at the time.
   ``It was a shock. I was cashiering and all of a sudden it
happened,'' Levin said. ``It was a well-built building and we still
don't know what caused it to collapse.''
   He escaped with three employees and three customers and said
there were 10 other employees and several more customers in the
store.
   The 40-year-old structure housed the department store on the
first floor, with the other two floors vacant but made of concrete,
Economedes said.
   ``That's what's making us go much slower. There are tons of
concrete on there and we are using cherry pickers to help us remove
the debris,'' he said.
   The National Weather Service said the collapse could have been
caused by the weight of rainwater from a storm that also caused
street flooding, especially in the downtown area.
   Anthony Padilla, a photographer for the Brownsville Herald, was
taking weather pictures across from the store before it collapsed.
   ``It was coming forward, then the window, the entire storefront,
the windows just exploded out,'' Padilla said. ``Glass just went
out. People just went like this, covered their heads, kind of
ducked down, and in the next instant, the whole thing just came
down.
   ``The people I had been looking at were just covered with
rubble,'' he said.

<HEAD>Texas Cities Duel over Ramses; Dallas Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas beat out San Antonio in a Texas-sized
duel for the right to hold an exhibition featuring artifacts of
Ramses II, one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs.
   Cairo's archaeological circles dubbed it the second ``Gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.''
   Each city was armed with what it considered a valid
letter-of-intent signed by Egyptian officials promising the popular
exhibit of the pharoah who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago.
   The Ramses exhibit will go to the Museum of Natural History in
Dallas in April and then return to Egypt. A compromise worked out
Thursday won't leave San Antonio empty-handed.
   The San Antonio Museum of Art will be second in line for ``Art
of Ancient Egypt,'' a new exhibition of art treasures from Egypt's
Nile Delta region. The exhibit debuts in November at Washington's
National Gallery and then travels to San Antonio in March 1990.
   ``I think it's a good solution,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
archaeological adviser to Egypt's Minister of Culture who drafted
the compromise.
   The Ramses exhibit opened in Montreal in 1985 and is on display
in Boston.
   The U.S. tour opened in Provo, Utah, in October 1985, and it has
been an attraction at Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and
Denver. It heads to Charlotte, N.C., in September before moving to
Dallas.
   Hawass said the problem between Dallas and San Antonio occurred
because both cities thought the Ramses exhibit was going to their
museums.
   ``Dallas has been interested in Ramses for about two years,'' he
said. ``And there is letter signed by Egyptian officials, which
Dallas considered a letter of intent, and San Antonio later signed
a regular letter of intent.
   ``So we were left with two cities, each wanting Ramses and each
thinking its letter was legal. We had to reach some sort of
solution.''
   Money from both exhibits will help finance a new Museum of the
Egyptian Civilization to be built in Cairo and the Nubia Museum at
Aswan, 615 miles to the south.
   Hawass said Dallas' contract calls for payment to the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization of $750,000, plus $100,000 for the use of
a 27-foot-tall Ramses statue restored by Egyptian and American
experts in honor of the exhibition.
   He said the agreement also calls for the organization to receive
5 percent of profits from the catalog and related items sold in the
museum shop.
   ``In the past Egypt didn't get a proper financial return for its
exhibits sent abroad. The Tutankhamun exhibit that toured England
and the United States is the best example,'' Hawass said. ``We know
every museum hosting such an exhibit makes $10 million to $12
million. Each exhibit draws more than a million viewers.''
   The exhibit featured gold and other items from Pharaoh
Tutankhamun's tomb, which toured several countries in the 1970s.
Egyptian officials complained that contracts were too tightly
drawn, leaving them out in the cold as far as sharing the profits.
   Hawass said the Culture Ministry has decided to demand for
future exhibits a minimum of $850,000, plus 50 percent from the
sale of catalogues and other items.
   ``We take a risk in sending artifacts out of Egypt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arafat Loyalists Evacuate Last Beirut Stronghold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 120 Palestinian guerrillas loyal to
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat evacuated a devastated refugee camp
Friday, surrendering their last stronghold in Beirut to a rival
Syrian-backed faction, police said.
   Members of the mainstream Fatah group left Bourj el-Barajneh
camp early in the day for to Sidon, a port city about 25 miles
south of the capital.
   Three leftist Lebanese militias supervised the evacuation at the
request of Sultan Abul-Ainen, the commander of Fatah forces in
Bourj el-Barajneh.
   Bourj el-Barajneh fell to the forces of Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising late Thursday after more than two months of fighting
between the rival Palestinian factions.
   By police count, about 127 people were killed and 527 wounded
since the fighting began May 1 for control of Bourj el-Barajneh and
the nearby Chatilla camp.
   Chatilla fell to Mousa's guerrillas June 27. A day later, 147
Fatah fighters left the camp for Sidon, where they joined the
Palestine Liberation Organization bases in the area.
   Arafat's loyalists, armed with Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles
and waving Palestinian flags and photographs of Arafat, emerged
from Bourj el-Barajneh camp at 7 a.m. Friday and quietly boarded
vehicles for the evacuation to Sidon.
   Mousa's men watched from a distance, waving victoriously as
Arafat's fighters withdrew from the camp.
   The evacuees were the last group of Arafat's guerrillas in
Beirut.
   Israel's army invaded the Lebanese capital in 1982 and forced
Arafat and his fighters to leave. Police have estimated that 5,000
hardline PLO guerrillas have filtered back to Lebanon since then,
and most were based in the Sidon region.
   A Syrian first lieutenant and four soldiers in a jeep
accompanied the evacuees Friday from Bourj el-Barajneh to the Awali
bridge at the northern entrance to Sidon. Syrian troops police the
coastal highway connecting Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Representatives of the Progressive Socialist Party, the Lebanese
Communist Party and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party supervised
the evacuation from Bourj el-Barajneh and accompanied Arafat's men
to Sidon.
   The evacuees arrived at Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp and
were greeted by fellow Fatah guerrillas.
   ``The heroes are welcome amongst their brothers,'' chanted a
group of guerrillas, firing their automatic rifles in the air in a
traditional welcome.
   Women threw rice and rose water at the convoy as it drove slowly
into the shantytown, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in
Lebanon with a population of nearly 50,000.
   Abul-Ainen, talking to reporters at Ein el-Hilweh, said Fatah
fighters were ousted from Beirut ``as a result of an
American-Syrian plot.''
   ``The plot aims at finishing the PLO,'' Abul-Ainen charged. He
declineds to elaborate.
   Mousa, with Syria's backing, broke away from the Palestine
Liberation Organization in 1983 and set up headquarters in
Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Fighting between Mousa's followers and Arafat's loyalists
erupted two months ago despite a reconciliation meeting between
Arafat Syrian President Hafez Assad in April.
   The PLO has claimed Syria, despite the reconciliation, was
behind the effort to drive Arafat's forces out of Beirut. Syria
denied any involvement.

   A gasoline storage tank caught fire as a
heavy thunderstorm passed over an oil refinery and rainfall
displaced the roof, authorities said today.
   No injuries were reported in the Thursday evening fire at the
80,000 gallon tank, which contained unleaded gasoline, said the
Hutchinson County sheriff's office.
   ``The water from the rain caused the roof to sink into the
gasoline,'' said Phillips Petroleum Co. spokesman Dan Harrison. The
roof rises and falls with the volume of gasoline inside.
   ``We began applying foam to seal the roof and, during the
application of foam, the fire broke out.''
   Harrison said about 50,000 to 55,000 gallons of foam was inside
the tank when fire broke out. The flames were extinguished, but the
gas reignited early this morning, he said.
   ``They have a large tank, containing unleaded gas, burning,''
said a sheriff's officer who declined to be identified. ``It looks
like they will have to wait until it burns itself out.''
   Two access roads to the refinery were closed, the officer said.
Plant workers were using foam and water to fight the blaze.
   Phillips is 55 miles northeast of Amarillo in the Texas
Panhandle.

   Pilots of civilian
helicopters say they often have communications problems with U.S.
Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf and the warships sometimes
misjudge altitude when warning aircraft away.
   U.S. Navy officials say the USS Vincennes was unable to
communicate with or identify Iran Air Flight 655 on Sunday before
shooting it down with missiles, killing 290 people.
   Pentagon spokesmen said the Vincennes and a second ship sent 12
unanswered warnings to the Airbus A300 before the guided-missile
cruiser fired. Iranian officials say the ship should have heard the
plane talking to ground control in Iran.
   Pilots of helicopters chartered by news organizations, who fly
much closer to warships than airliners, described several incidents
in which they did not hear warnings or the Navy did not respond to
their calls.
   One of them, Chris Howard, said he and another charter pilot
could not reach a Navy vessel Thursday on Channel 16, the universal
emergency frequency. ``I called and called ... and eventually
another American ship (farther away) responded,'' he said.
   The American destroyer John Hancock locked its weapons on a
helicopter chartered by NBC News when the chopper did not respond
Wednesday to at least two warnings overheard by other pilots nearby.
   When the helicopter pilot finally made contact with the ship, he
said he had been monitoring the emergency frequency but did not
hear the earlier messages.
   Capt. Massoud Razavi of Iran Air told a news conference in
London that pilots sometimes ``can't be sure they are talking to
you'' when they hear Navy messages. He sometimes flies the Bandar
Abbas-Dubai route on which the Airbus was shot down,
   Charter pilot Peter Byrne also said it is not always clear which
aircraft is being addressed. Byrne said he ignored a warning
recently because he was over the desert, five miles from water, and
didn't realize the call was for his helicopter until he heard a
second warning.
   He said Navy ships ``quite often'' appear to have trouble
pinpointing altitude. He reported overhearing a ship warning off a
chopper recently that was flying at 500 feet, addressing it on the
radio as being at 1,500 feet.
   Pentagon officials said the Vincennes fired at the Iranian jet
partly because it was detected at about 7,000 feet and descending,
but also said another Navy ship reported the jet, as did Iran, at
12,000 feet or higher.
   No previous incident led to a Navy attack on a civilian
aircraft, but pilots said Iranian ships have fired on helicopters
several times without warning.
   Byrne said the Navy's prudence might stem from its familiarity
with the flight patterns of news helicopters, which have dogged the
fleet since it expanded operations in the gulf in July 1987.
   Howard said ``there's a communications problem,'' but ``things
are certainly better than they were a year ago. ... It was chaos.
They were calling on the UHF frequency, which civilian aircraft
don't carry.''
   He added, in sympathy with the difficulties of communications
officers: ``We are only aware of our side of the problem.''
   Byrne said pilots often have several radios receiving messages
on different frequencies and might briefly turn down the volume on
the general emergency frequency to hear a message on another
channel.
   Iran Air officials say the pilot of Flight 655 was busy
communicating with control towers after taking off from Bandar
Abbas on the short flight to Dubai. The Airbus was shot down
minutes later.
   Mansour Ahmadyan, deputy senior air traffic controller in Dubai,
said a hot air inversion layer common in the gulf sometimes
interferes with radio and radar reception at low altitudes. He said
the problem is rare at higher altitudes, however, and would not
speculate about what happened last Sunday.
   U.S. officials said the Iranian airliner appeared to be using a
military transponder, a device that helps radars identify planes,
as well as a civilian version. Ahmadyan said he had no information
about the Airbus, but had never seen a civilian aircraft with such
a transponder on a flight to Dubai.

   A truck filled with explosives blew
up in the Afghan city of Jalalabad today, killing 31 people,
wrecking nearby buildings and setting other vehicles on fire, Radio
Kabul reported.
   The explosion ripped through a crowded business district in the
city, the capital of eastern Nangarhar province, the report said.
It was the third bomb in three days to explode in an Afghan city.
   Two car bombs exploded in the capital, Kabul, this week, killing
seven people and injuring several more.
   The Jalalabad blast heavily damaged 45 buildings and destroyed
25 vehicles, Radio Kabul said, quoting Afghanistan's official
Bakhtar news agency. It said the damaged buildings included a
cinema and several shops and homes.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, did not mention injuries.
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said 33 people were badly
injured.
   Many of the victims were children, Tass said.
   Bakhtar blamed ``Afghan extremists'' for the attack, apparently
referring to guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet government.
   On May 15, Soviet troops pulled out of Jalalabad to begin the
end of the Red Army's involvement in Afghanistan. The city, about
70 miles east of the Afghan capital of Kabul, has been the scene of
heavy fighting in the country's civil war.
   The Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in December
1979 to back the government. In April, the Soviets agreed to a
U.N.-brokered pact that commits them to pull out the more than
100,000 troops they deployed in Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader's Visit to Poland an Opportunity to Highlight
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-day visit by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev beginning Monday provides Polish authorities a chance to
highlight their own restructuring of politics and the economy.
   Party leaders say it will strengthen pro-reform forces in Poland.
   In public statements and private conversations, officials have
expressed delight that Gorbachev is arriving fresh from his
triumphs at a special party congress in Moscow, and they stress
parallels between Soviet ``perestroika'' and Polish ``socialist
renewal.''
   ``Soviet perestroika helps Polish renewal, and vice versa,''
said Stefan Staniszewski, Poland's foreign affairs spokesman.
   Poland, a sometimes unruly communist ally straddling the pathway
between Moscow and Western Europe, is vital to the Soviet Union.
The trip appears designed mainly to reinforce ties between the two
countries during an era when each is embarking on dramatic
political changes.
   Gorbachev, who is personally popular in Poland, also will be
working to overcome a traditional antipathy among Poles toward
Russians that has existed for centuries.
   It is unclear, however, if he will defuse the single most
painful issue between the two peoples: admitting that Soviet forces
massacred 4,000 Polish officers in Katyn forest in the Ukraine in
1940.
   Official Polish and Soviet histories have maintained the
massacre was committed by the Nazis in 1941, contrary to evidence
in the West and the belief of most Poles. A Polish-Soviet
historical commission charged last year with correcting ``blank
spots'' in history has been re-examining the question, amid signals
that Soviet responsibility finally would be acknowledged.
   But Polish officials prior to Gorbachev's arrival were playing
down the possibility of a dramatic admission by the Soviet leader,
saying it is a matter of ongoing research.
   Gorbachev ``will say something about the issue generally,
because of Polish feelings,'' said one Polish official, who
requested anonymity. ``How he will say it we don't know?''
   Since assuming leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union in 1985, Gorbachev has been to Poland twice, for a party
conference and a Warsaw Pact meeting. But Polish authorities say
this is his first full-scale ceremonial visit.
   In addition to meeting Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
and addressing the Sejm, or Parliament, Gorbachev will travel south
to the medieval Polish capital of Krakow and to the northwestern
Baltic port city of Szczecin, where he will address shipyard
workers.
   A side trip will take him to the Tatra Mountain village of
Poronin, where Vladimir I. Lenin spent two years in exile from
czarist Russia before returning to lead the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917.
   Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, will visit the former Nazi death camp
of Auschwitz-Birkenau, where 4 million people were murdered before
the camp's liberation by the Red Army on Jan. 27, 1945.
   After the bilateral portion of the trip ends Thursday,
Gorbachev, Jaruzelski and party chiefs from the other five Warsaw
Pact nations meet for two days in Warsaw. Gorbachev returns to
Moscow on Saturday.
   Squeezed between a recalcitrant apparatus slowing reforms and an
active opposition movement spearheaded by the outlawed Solidarity
trade union, leaders of the communist Polish United Workers Party
say the visit will provide them a political boost.
   ``It is without doubt that Mr. Gorbachev's stay in Poland will
strengthen those who are aiming at reconstruction,'' said Politburo
member Mieczyslaw Rakowski at a news conference Thursday.
   Gorbachev is expected to endorse the Polish reforms,
undercutting the hardliners' traditional reliance on their ties to
Moscow, while emphasizing that the party should be the agent of
change and not outside dissenters.
   Opposition spokesmen have said the visit will have an important
effect in determining how far the government can go towards
political pluralism, but Rakowski dismissed such expectations.
   ``The question of the opposition is an internal one,'' he said.
``The visit will have no influence on the existing relations.''
   The visit comes two months after a wave of strikes that
contained echoes of the 1980-81 labor upheaval in Poland, and
Gorbachev could use his meeting with shipyard workers in Szczecin
to address the issue of worker demands.
   Poland is the Soviet Union's largest East bloc ally. Putting
Szczecin on the itinerary also underlined Poland's security
interest in the alliance.
   The city is part of the Western territories secured for Poland
from defeated Germany at the end of World War II, and official
propaganda stresses that Soviet strength helps guarantee the
existing borders.
   Authorities also say they expect Gorbachev to speak on East-West
relations during the visit.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration believes
guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk is the key to peace in
Cambodia, according to a letter delivered to him Friday by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   The letter from President Reagan also invited the resistance
leader to visit Washington and reaffirmed U.S. opposition to a
return to power by the communist Khmer Rouge, said State Department
spokesman Charles Redman.
   Shultz and Sihanouk, who once described the United States as
Cambodia's No. 1 enemy, met for 45 minutes Friday in Bangkok, where
both attended discussions between the six-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and six allies.
   Shultz told Sihanouk that the United States believed he had a
``central role to play in whatever will be arrived at in
Cambodia,'' Redman said.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, has pledged to withdraw
all troops by 1990. That would leave a fragile pro-Hanoi government
facing a three-party, Sihanouk-led coalition. The Khmer Rouge,
which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 1975-78
rule, is considered the strongest force in the anti-Vietnamese
coalition.
   Redman declined to say if Sihanouk had asked Shultz for U.S.
military aid for his own followers in the coalition. Washington
says it supplies only non-military, humanitarian assistance.
   Sihanouk said he was ready to go to Jakarta with his coalition
partners July 25 to take part in informal discussions among the
warring Cambodian factions.
   The 65-year-old Cambodian leader also proposed a national army
which would include all Cambodian factions, helping to neutralize
the Chinese-armed Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk's return to center stage is one of many in his career
that has included kingship as a youth; political leadership of
Cambodia in the 1960s and ouster from power by U.S.-backed Gen. Lon
Nol in 1970. He then acted as nominal head of a Khmer
Rouge-dominated front which fought the Lon Nol government.
   Not long after their 1975 victory he was kept under house arrest
by the Khmer Rouge. He was released only to plead Cambodia's case
before the world community as the Vietnamese invasion force neared
Phnom Penh.
   Also Friday, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda of Thailand
presented Shultz with the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant,
a royal decoration first issued by Rama IV in 1861.
   On Saturday, Shultz will meet with officials in the Malaysian
capital of Kuala Lumpur and then will fly on to Jakarta, Indonesia.
   In Kuala Lumpur on Friday, about 50 Moslem youths demonstrated
in front of the U.S. Embassy to protest Sunday's downing of an
Iranian airliner by U.S. missile cruiser in the Persian Gulf. The
United States said it mistook the jetliner for a F-14 fighter plane.
   Also Friday, 19 members of Malaysia's Parliament demanded the
release of 42 people being held without trial. Shultz may discuss
human rights issues Saturday with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Change Capital Workers' Residency Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Friday to replace a District
of Columbia rule requiring city employees to live in the nation's
capital with a hiring plan giving preference to city residents,
modifying earlier House action that killed the residency rule.
   The Senate approved by voice vote an amendment offered by Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., that would direct the city to adopt a
preferential hiring plan by May 1, 1989, and implement the law by
Sept. 30, 1989, or else forfeit federal money used to enforce the
requirement.
   The amendment, crafted in a flurry of talks late Thursday and
early Friday between Warner and Sens. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and
Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., came as the Senate debated the district's
$3.2 billion budget for the 1989 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   The city is slated to receive $430.5 million in federal money in
1989 to compensate for tax-exempt property the federal government
occupies and the public services it receives.
   Congressional involvement in the city's residency requirement
was sparked by concerns that the law was restricting police hiring
while crime was on the increase. Opponents charged that Congress
was interfering with the city's right to self-governance.
   Rep. Stanford Parris, R-Va., attached an amendment to the city's
House appropriations bill on Tuesday that eliminated the 8-year-old
residency rule. After House Democrats removed a preferential-hiring
clause from the amendment, the measure passed the House by a
246-163 margin.
   The two bills now go to a House-Senate conference to draft a
compromise version. But supporters and opponents of the residency
requirement both praised the Senate's action.
   Opponents of the rule persuaded members of Congress that the
district's high cost of living made it difficult for municipal
workers to reside in the city, leaving crucial positions vacant.
   Police union officials pointed to a steady decline in police
department applications in the midst of a record-level crime wave
in the city.
   Police statistics indicate that crime climbed by 17 percent in
the first four months of 1988 compared with the same period last
year and police blame a surge of drug-related violence for much of
the record pace of 157 homicides.
   There were 107 homicides at this time last year and 228 in all
of 1987.
   Supporters of the rule argued that police applications are
declining nationwide, and that the city's residency rule could not
be blamed for hiring difficulties.

   Here is the text of the speech by Carlos
Salinas de Gortari claiming victory for the Institutional
Revolutionary Party in presidential elections.
   The speech was made Thursday and translated by The Associated
Press:
   Fellow citizens:
   Yesterday, we Mexicans lived through an extraordinary day. We
showed that we wish to live in peace and in freedom and plot our
own destiny within the framework of the law.
   We have achieved national victory in the election for president.
We have achieved it in one of the most contested elections in our
history and also one of the most peaceful. The national triumph is
clear and without doubt. The information coming to our party so
shows it.
   I want to thank the millions of Mexicans who voted for me for
their confidence and support. My commitment is with all of them
and, from now on, with the nation as a whole.
   I am aware that the enormous and encouraging affluence of voters
and the scrupulous and careful counting by all the parties makes
this a very complex process and, consequently, the official figures
will continue to flow in the hours to come as the law requires, and
I adhered to that.
   I want to extend my recognition for the extraordinary work my
party has done _ to the national leadership and to the state and
national ones. I want to do so especially for the farm, labor and
popular sectors for their sustained efforts while they accompanied
me during this long campaign.
   To the established sectors throughout the republic, I extend to
them my greatest appreciation for their delicate work.
   I reiterate my thanks to the voters who voted for me and my
respect for those who opted otherwise.
   The contest in the election is beginning to show the triumph of
our candidates for the Senate and the House of Deputies and, also,
more triumphs for the opposition than those they have obtained up
to now. I acknowledge therefore the plurality of the country that I
have pledged to respect and encourage.
   The information allows me to observe that the opposition is
showing majority strength in various districts of the country. It
is the new political reality of the nation with which we will have
to live in a harmonious and respectful manner.
   This expression of plurality is a demonstration of Mexico's
democratic progress, and I acknowledge it. The era of practically a
single party is ending, and we are entering now a new political
stage in the life of the country, with a majority party and a very
intense competition from the opposition.
   I have pledged to recognize legal victories by the opposition
and defend firmly within the law those of my party. I will do so
because of my deep democratic conviction and for the unity of the
nation.
   Onward my fellow citizens.

   A man accused of killing a rural mail
carrier by choking her with her mail-bag straps will was ordered
held without bond Friday on a murder charge.
   Joseph Williams, 39, of Pinetta, was arrested Thursday in the
death of Immogene Rogers, 42. He appeared Friday before Madison
County Judge Wetzel Blair.
   Mrs. Rogers' body was found June 20 in thick underbrush three
miles south of Pinetta, a small farm community near the border with
Georgia. Her mailbag straps were wrapped around her neck.
   She had completed about half of her 66-mile route, investigators
said. Postal workers had requested a search after receiving
complaints from people on Mrs. Rogers' route that their mail hadn't
been delivered.
   Madison County Sheriff Joe Peavy said Williams is an admitted
crack-cocaine addict whose possible motive for the killing remained
murky. Neither robbery nor sexual assault appeared to have occurred.
   No plea was entered, and no arraignment scheduled.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Stiff Sentences For Family Marijuana Farm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge rejected a prosecutor's plea
for stiff sentences for seven members of a farm family who ran an
elaborate marijuana farm.
   In Montana's early days, District Judge Chan Ettien said
Thursday, ``More than one rancher saved the family homestead by the
manufacture and sale of moonshine whiskey.''
   The Richard Kurth family said it ran the high-tech farm to pay
off farm debts.
   He said the evil of marijuana use ``does not approach that of
alcohol,'' and noted ``an expanding argument that marijuana should
be decriminalized.''
   Ettien sentenced Richard Kurth to 20 years in prison with 15
years suspended. Kurth's wife was sentenced to five years, with the
judge saying she should be held accountable for involving her
children.
   The other five members of the family _ the Kurths' children and
their spouses _ were given suspended or deferred sentences.
Deferred sentences carry no permanent criminal record.
   Chouteau County Attorney Tom Sheehy proposed 30 years for Kurth;
10 years for his wife; 10 for one child; and suspended felony
sentences with some local jail time for the others.
   Sheehy described the marijuana operation as a
``controlled-growing situation, of essentially greenhouse quality''
with timed lights and electronic watering and insecticide spraying
systems.
   Just before the October 1987 raid on the farm, the family had
begun manufacturing hashish oil from the plants, he said.
   Over two years, the family took in about $400,000 for the
marijuana, Sheehy said. Law enforcement officials who raided the
farm estimated the street value of the drugs at $3 million to $5
million.
   The Kurths have maintained throughout the case that they got
into the marijuana business in an attempt to pay off debts on their
farm property.
   Officials estimated that, with good behavior, Richard Kurth
would spend about one year in prison, while his wife would spend
about two months.
   The sentences brought some angry reaction from the farming
community of Fort Benton, where the Kurths ran their operation.
   ``We might as well go out and pull up our gardens and plant
pot,'' Bev Dollar said. ``We're safer doing that than drinking
beer.''
   Mary Lynn Knudsen, who is involved in a local drug task force,
said the sentences send a message to teen-agers ``that just about
anybody could grow marijuana and it's OK. Justice wasn't done
today.''

<HEAD>President Lee Chosen Party Leader, Boosts His Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui was elected
chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party on Friday in a vote that
strengthens his power in the factional leadership that followed the
Chiang Kai-shek family dynasty.
   Lee is the first native Taiwanese to lead the party in its
94-year-history.
   The 65-year-old Lee was elected at a congress of the party,
known as the Kuomintang, which was formed in 1894 on mainland China
and still claims to be the legitimate ruler of all China. The
Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the
Communists.
   Lee follows Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang
Ching-kuo, as party leader. He became president and acting party
leader upon the death of Chiang Ching-kuo on Jan. 13.
   The congress also received a discussion paper on China policy
issued by party leaders that proposed only a limited relaxation of
civilian contacts with the mainland. Last year, a ban on travel to
mainland China was lifted so Taiwan residents could visit relatives.
   Overshadowing the official business of the congress, however,
was the surprise appearance of aging Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who
received an emotional standing ovation from the nearly 1,200
delegates.
   Madame Chiang, who is at least 87 and rarely appears in public,
sat on the stage as party secretary-general Lee Huan read her
statement praising elderly party comrades set to retire and urging
the Nationalists not to forget their goal of reunifying China.
   ``We are facing a critical moment as our senior members are
retiring and are succeeded by the new blood,'' she said in the
statement, reminding delegates the old guard's ``contribution to
the party and the state should never be ignored.''
   Wearing a white traditional Chinese dress and black vest, she
shook hands with Lee Teng-hui before leaving the stage.
   All but eight of the 1,184 delegates attending Friday's session
stood up to support Lee's nomination. Jaw Shau-kong, a young
Nationalist lawmaker, did not stand because he wanted a secret
ballot as an expression of democractic change from past practice.
   The congress is the first in which delegates were not picked by
top party officials and in which the Central Committee election
will not be restricted to candidates proposed by the party leader.
   The selection of Lee is the first of several crucial personnel
moves to be made. New faces are expected in the party's
policy-making Central Standing Committee and the Cabinet as some
old-guard Kuomintang conservatives from the Chinese mainland step
down.
   During nearly 40 years of the Kuomintang's authoritarian rule,
Taiwan developed into an export-fueled economic powerhouse. Chiang
Ching-kuo in his final years also introduced democratic change by
lifting martial law and allowing opposition political parties.
   Lee has vowed to continue the democratic trend and also supports
reforming the state-dominated financial system and other
liberalizing moves.
   Polls have shown Lee to be immensely popular as the first native
Taiwanese to lead the country. Native Taiwanese, ethnic Chinese
whose families settled in Taiwan before 1949, account for about 85
percent of its nearly 20 million people.
   Lee's popularity and his efforts not to alienate conservatives
have helped increase his influence as he deals with powerful
Nationalist mainlanders including Lee Huan, Premier Yu Kuo-hwa and
Gen. Hau Pei-tsun, chief of the military general staff.
   In Beijing, China's Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang sent
congratulations to Lee, saying he hoped it would lead to
reunification, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Taiwan has rebuffed Beijing's overtures to reunify under a ``one
country, two system'' program.

<HEAD>Shield Law Doesn't Exempt Reporters From Eyewitness Testimony,
Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Shield Law doesn't exempt
journalists from giving eyewitness accounts when called on to
testify, an appeals court ruled.
   Arguments by lawyers from the Los Angeles Times that a reporter
and photographer were protected from disclosing ``unpublished
information'' regarding an arrest they witnessed were unanimously
rejected Thursday by the three-justice 2nd Appellate District Court
in Los Angeles.
   Reversing a Superior Court ruling, the justices said reporters
have the same duty as any bystander if called to testify about what
they witnessed in public.
   ``I think the Shield Law was never intended to protect news
reporters,'' said Gerry Ensley, a Long Beach deputy city
prosecutor. ``It was intended to protect reporters' confidential
sources.''
   In cases where reporters aren't protecting confidential sources,
``there is no basis to differentiate the newsperson's observation
of the event from that of any other citizen,'' said the opinion
written by Justice Robert Devich.
   The ruling takes effect 30 days from Thursday.
   Times general counsel William Niese said a request for a state
Supreme Court review was likely.
   ``If reporters are converted into automatic witnesses, the
ability of reporters to retain their objectivity and be objective
witnesses ... would be seriously undermined,'' Niese said.
   The case stemmed from the prosecution of a Long Beach man for
alleged possession of brass knuckles in September 1986.
   Sean Patrick Delaney, 21, contended that police never asked his
permission to search his jacket pocket, where officers allegedly
found the weapon.
   Reporter Roxana Kopetman and former photographer Roberto
Santiago Bertero witnessed the search and arrest, but their news
account did not mention whether officers asked such permission.
   Called to testify in Municipal Court, Ms. Kopetman and Bertero
declined to answer questions about whether permission was requested.
   They contended that since the information wasn't included in the
story, the Shield Law protected them from having to answer. Both
were found in contempt of court.

<TEXT>
   An Austrian won Israel's
first international balloon race Friday, capping a three-day event
in which more than 40 balloons glided through skies and Israeli
fighter planes buzzed overhead.
   First place earned Hubert Kusternigg $4,000.
   Bill Arras of Redmond, Ore., and Wallace Henderson of Vienna,
Va., took second and third places at the International Hot Air
Balloon Goodwill Fiesta, organized as part of Israel's 40th
anniversary celebration.
   About 40,000 spectators braved scorching heat and dust clouds to
watch the colorful 70-foot balloons, which floated thousands of
feet above Israel's southern Negev Desert.
   On one balloon, competitor Ron Bush rose to about 5,000 feet in
a blue and white striped balloon and then got stuck during a lull
in the wind.
   Bush, 48, of Lubbock, Texas, didn't seem worried when he saw
that he was far from the target and not moving any closer.
   ``It's peaceful up here,'' he said, pushing his Stetson to the
back of his neck. ``I'm doing this for fun, not to win
competitions.''
   The calm was interrupted several times by Israeli fighter planes
which flew loops around the balloonists, sometimes buzzing them
from only 200 feet away.The planes flew in formation, spewing blue
and white smoke, Israel's national colors.
   Forty-one people participated in the race, including 19 from the
United States and competitors from Canada, France, Hungary and West
Germany.
   The competitors were graded on how close they came to a certain
target.
   Spectators thronged the balloonists between races, asking
technical questions and pleading to be taken for a ride.
   Balloonist Alfred Riesser, 40, of Vienna, Austria, said his most
enjoyable moment came when the wind carried him into a nearby
Bedouin tent village.
   ``A little boy was so afraid that at first he threw a stone and
then screamed for his dad,'' Riesser said. ``The adults also didn't
come near us, but then we handed out some stickers with a picture
of the balloon and that broke the ice.''
   Ted O'Hara, 44, an insurance agent from Schenectady, N.Y., said
he was startled Thursday when two men armed with submachine guns
rushed to the landing site as he touched down.
   It turned out they were spectators trying to help him steady the
balloon, he said.
   O'Hara said he was not conerned about his safety in Israel,
despite a seven-month wave of clashes between Arabs and Jews.
   ``I heard there's been shooting in Jerusalem for the last couple
of days but I still think it's safer than in some parts of New York
City,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Criticize Decision on Federal Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has for a third
time denied aid to residents affected by the May 4 explosion at the
Pacific Engineering plant.
   Gov. Richard Bryan said Thursday he was informed that the third
request for aid was turned down by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency because insurance covered most of the $73 million in
property damage caused by the explosions. Henderson officials have
estimated uninsured damage at $20 million.
   ``I was disappointed and a bit frustrated,'' Bryan said. ``The
federal government makes an appeal to our patriotism, which
Nevadans respond to, and then when a problem arises of this nature,
the federal government says these are problems you have to take
elsewhere.''
   City Manager Gary Bloomquist said he was upset that the federal
government would help rebuild the plant while denying help to those
who suffered damage.
   ``The fact is the plant damaged many people in the area and now
the federal government is going to see it is rebuilt again,''
Bloomquist said. ``That's not reasonable.''
   The blast killed two people and injured 326.
   The government has agreed to pay surcharges on the ammonium
perchlorate produced by Pacfic Engineering to assist in rebuilding
the plant. Company officials have indicated they will rebuild
outside the Las Vegas Valley.
   Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid rocket fuel
used in the space shuttle and military rockets. The Kerr-McGee
plant in Henderson is the only facility in the U.S. producing the
rocket fuel oxidizer.
   Bryan said he would continue to make state services available
and urged Congress to create a special fund to compensate victims
of such disasters.
   The cause of the blast remains under investigation.

   The explosion and fire that destroyed the Piper
Alpha oil rig Wednesday night was the world's worst oilfield
disaster, claiming 166 lives. This is a reconstruction compiled
from official logs and interviews with survivors.

<TEXT>
   The men from the 12-hour day shift
were going to bed on the Piper Alpha oil platform and Derek
Ellington was in the control room. He heard a gas leak ``screaming
like a banshee.''
   It was 9:31 p.m. Wednesday in the North Sea, 120 miles from
Scotland. Thirty seconds later, an explosion and fire began
devouring the platform, which had 230 men aboard.
   Not until 27 minutes after the initial explosion did word reach
the mainland. The Aberdeen Coast Guard picked up a distress signal
from the supply vessel Lowland Cavalier near the man-made island,
which was 649 feet tall, two-thirds submerged and supported by
steel stilts planted in the seabed.
   Four minutes later, at 10:02, Eoin Kerr, a telecommunications
officer in Scotland, heard a man say from the Piper Alpha: ``The
radio room's on fire, we're abandoning the rig.''
   Kerr heard nothing more.
   Within one minute of the first distress call, Royal Air Force
rescue helicopters scrambled and a Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft
headed to the scene.
   ``There was a big bang and I knew there had been an explosion,''
said James McDonald, 50, who managed to get off the Piper Alpha.
``The rig was plunged into darkness.''
   He and some others tried to leave the crew's quarters, but ``the
flames were shooting into the doors. ... For about three-quarters
of an hour we were sitting inside. Nobody seemed to know what to
do.''
   The Nimrod pilot, Garfield Porter, could see the horizon stained
orange with fire from 80 miles away. Approaching at 15,000 feet,
``the whole area was lit up and the flames were very high into the
sky,'' he said.
   Helicopter pilots said they felt the heat from more than a mile
away. Choppers swept in low and dropped ropes to survivors in the
water.
   A converted trawler on standby duty lowered lifeboats that
collected 37 survivors. A lifeboat from the support ship Sandhaven
vanished into the flames.
   Fire spread rapidly, turning metal girders red-hot and bringing
decks crashing down in half-molten heaps.
   The men faced a hard choice: stay aboard and hope aid got to
them before the flames, or jump into a sea that was cold enough
below the burning oil to kill them. Even on a clear summer night,
the water temperature was 57 degrees.
   Burning oil was spreading across the few bare patches of water
remaining and the decision had to be made quickly.
   ``I decided to get myself out,'' McDonald said. ``I wasn't going
to sit down and get burned to death. ... You either stayed where
you were and burned to death or you tried to get out.''
   Roy Carey, an instrument technician, said: ``It was a case of
fry and die or jump and try.''
   McDonald said he had to push past other men clogging the
stairways, then through the flames onto the drill deck, which was
not yet burning. He slithered down a pipe and dropped the last few
feet into the water.
   When he looked up ``the only thing standing was the drill
derrick. There was no accommodation (living deck), no rig, no
heli-deck, just flames coming shooting out of the sea.''
   Carey dived 50 feet into the water. Debris showered down and
bodies floated past him. ``I found my head was being cooked,'' he
said. ``I had to keep ducking down to get it cool.''
   The Coast Guard appealed for ships to help the 15 helicopters
and 30 responded, including a six-ship NATO task force that radioed
at 10:36 it was breaking off maneuvers to join the search.
   A supply and support vessel, the Tharos, sprayed the fire with
seawater but the only result was clouds of steam.
   ``There was nothing anybody could do,'' said Tony Sinnett, who
watched from the Tharos. ``It was like the platform had been hit by
an atomic bomb.''
   Porter, the reconnaissance pilot, said the flames shot hundreds
of feet into the sky.
   At 11:30 p.m. lifeboats had picked up 25 survivors. The crew's
quarters were an inferno.
   ``Windows and the emergency door were cracking under the intense
heat. There must have been at least 100 men in there,'' said Harry
Calder, 35.
   ``It was sheer panic. A lot of guys were lying on the floor,
just trying to breathe. We had towels and we were just dipping them
in anything to help us breathe.''
   He managed to get out, but believes all the others died.
   At 11:24, the Tharos radioed that underwater explosions of
escaping gas were forcing it to retreat. At three minutes after
midnight, it said everyone likely to have survived had been picked
up.
   The search continued. Occidental Petroleum, which owns the
platform, said the last of 64 survivors was rescued at 3:05 a.m.
   At 12:46 a.m. the living quarters sank beneath the sea. When the
NATO ships arrived next morning, there was nothing left to do but
search for bodies.
   Seventeen had been found by Friday night.
   Only about one-quarter of the rig remained standing. Thick
support girders were bent double and flames still flickered on the
wreck.
   In Aberdeen, Kay Harney watched the scenes on television and
remembered the telephone call Wednesday night from her boyfriend,
Eddie Crowden.
   He said he was bored with his job of checking lifeboats and
safety equipment on the Piper Alpha.
   That was at 9:25 p.m.
   Eddie Crowden's name was not on the list of survivors.

<HEAD>Dudley Moore's Arthur Goes On The Wagon In `On The Rocks'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dudley Moore's lovable drunk in ``Arthur''
returns in the sequel ``Arthur 2 On The Rocks,'' just as lovable
but not quite as drunk.
   Moore, who won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the
pickled millionaire Arthur Bach, said his approach to the character
this time was different because of a heightened awareness of
alcoholism.
   ``There was no official pressure from the studio or from any
organized groups,'' Moore said in a recent interview. ``But I
personally have an educated awareness of the problem, and there
were discussions on how aware we should make Arthur. It was
difficult to decide, but eventually we decided to make him aware.''
   The producers also avoided any scenes in ``Arthur 2 On The
Rocks'' of Arthur drinking and driving, unlike the original in
which Arthur is seen cruising in his Rolls Royce swigging from a
bottle.
   ``There's a scene in which Linda (Liza Minnelli) says she never
lets him drink and drive,'' Moore said. ``And you can tell that
Arthur knows exactly what he should or should not do. He still gets
very drunk, but that's because he feels panicked and isolated
sometimes and unable to cope with the world.''
   Moore is quick to point out, however, that the film doesn't
preach.
   ``We never intended to make a documentary,' Moore said.
``Arthur's behavior doesn't have to mirror real life.''
   The sequel opened Friday at theaters nationwide.

   Iran's small fleet of F-14 fighters has
become one focus of attention in the investigation of why the U.S.
missile cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner with 290
people aboard.
   The Pentagon has said transponder signals from the Iran Air
Airbus A300 civilian aircraft caused the warship to mistake it for
an Iranian F-14.
   The American-built fighters, called the Tomcat, are part of a
depleted inventory of combat-ready warplanes that Iran has used
sparingly in its war with Iraq.
   The swing-wing interceptors were one of the most advanced
aircraft in the world when about 80 of them were sold to Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's air force in the mid-1970s.
   After nearly eight years of warfare, Tehran's F-14 force was
believed to have dwindled to fewer than 10 operational aircraft,
according to some military analysts.
   U.S. officials put their numbers somewhat higher, in ``the
teens,'' and have said in recent days that the force may have been
increased by Iran's success in acquiring badly needed spare parts.
   The Grumman aircraft saw combat action in 1985. Since then it
has been used primarily for its powerful radar systems that can
alert other Iranian fighters to the approach of Iraqi warplanes.
   The operational area of the F-14s was around Iran's Kharg Island
oil terminal in the northern Persian Gulf and over the coastal
sealanes used by Tehran's oil shuttle tankers carrying oil from
Kharg to the Larak island terminal in the Strait of Hormuz.
   On Feb. 9, Iran claimed it shot down three Iraqi jets during a
raid on Kharg.
   Days later, U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Armitage
disclosed in a Pentagon briefing that one Iraqi aircraft was shot
down by an F-14, using a U.S.-made Sidewinder air-to-air missile.
He said it was the F-14's ``first effective use in combat that
we've seen in several months.''
   U.S. officials said recently that some of the F-14s had been
shifted from the northern gulf to the big military base at Bandar
Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz.
   It was from Bandar Abbas that the Iran Air Airbus took off last
Sunday.
   U.S. sources, who spoke on condition they not to be named, said
Friday that the transfer of F-14s from Bushehr to Bandar Abbas may
have been motivated by Iraq's devastating, long-range air strike on
May 14 on the Larak island terminal in the strait, where
international tankers pick up the oil brought south from Kharg.
   In that raid, the world's biggest ship, the Seawise Giant, which
Iran uses as a storage and transfer tanker, and four others were
damaged.
   The F-14s were airborne in the skies around the strait in the
days prior to the Iran Air incident, but had not taken part in any
combat action. As interceptors equipped with air-to-air missiles,
they are not designed for ttacks on ships.
   In addition to the F-14s, Iran has some aging F-4 Phantoms and
some F-5s, acquired from the United States during the shah's regime.
   Although they watch the aircraft carefully, U.S. warships in the
gulf have not faced many serious threats from Iran's warplanes. The
Iranian fighters generally give the Americans a wide berth, and
observe good radio protocol when challenged, U.S. officers say.
   U.S. commanders have worried most about Iraqi pilots,
particularly in view of the May 17, 1987 attack on the missile
frigate Stark by an Iraqi Mirage, in which 37 American crewmen
died. Washington officially accepted Iraq's explanation that the
attack was a mistake.
   Several subsequent incidents, including one in which a U.S.
missile cruiser Richmond K. Turner came within a second of shooting
down three Iraqi warplanes, led the two governments to work out
procedures to protect U.S. warships from another Iraqi attack in
the northern gulf.
   U.S. officials said they had no information to support a
published report that another U.S. missile cruiser, the Halsey, had
fired a flare in a brush with two Iranian F-14s on July 2 _ the day
before the Airbus disaster.
   ``This is the first we've heard of the Halsey firing a flare or
any of those other details,'' said one source, who has access to
operational reports, and spoke on condition he not be named.
   The Pentagon on Thursday released the transcript of a radio
exchange between the Halsey, on station in the northern Gulf, and
an Iranian F-14 on that same day.
   The brief exchange was presented by the U.S. officials to show
that the Iranians routinely respond to such queries from the U.S.
Navy ships in the gulf.
   The Pentagon says the Vincennes and another U.S. ship issued 12
warnings to the Iran Air jetliner before it was shot down.
   There have been some reports in the aftermath of the tragedy
that the two sides do not routinely communicate by radio.
   ``The idea that the Iranians don't answer our queries is
baloney,'' said one American source. Added another: ``To say that
there are routine exchanges between U.S. ships and Iranian military
aircraft is an accurate statement.''

   Chita Rivera is still ``picking 'em up
and putting 'em down,'' as she calls her dancing, and she's
high-kicking these days in the company of some of the best-known
legs in show business.
   Rivera, who's appearing with 13 members of the Radio City Music
Hall Rockettes in ``Can-Can'' at Caesars Palace, says she hopes her
six-month national tour of the production will help educate the
public about the theater.
   How did she get her start?
   ``I loved music,'' the 55-year-old entertainer recalled. ``But I
was very much a tomboy. I was breaking a lot of furniture so my
mother said she'd better channel this energy.''
   She dreamed of becoming a ballerina, but cast aside her ballet
slippers when she won a part in ``Call Me Madam'' at age 17. Her
1957 performance as Anita in ``West Side Story'' established her as
a Broadway star.

   When Ronald Reagan turns over the Oval Office
to his successor, he'll already have a place to put his pens and
paperweight.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation will have a 34th-floor
office ready for the chief executive when it's time to put
``former'' in front of ``President Reagan.''
   The foundation, which is managing construction of the $60
million Reagan presidential library in Ventura County, plans to
move into a new Century City high-rise in the fall, said C. Ronald
Kimberling, foundation executive director. It currently has offices
elsewhere in Century City.
   Terms of the president's lease on the office were not disclosed.
   A group of Reagan associates has arranged for the Reagans to
live in a Bel-Air home after the president leaves the White House.
The couple has already signed a three-year lease with an option to
renew or buy the house.
   The Reagans also have their Rancho del Cielo property in the
Santa Ynez Mountains above Santa Barbara.

   Hit singles in French and English
are nothing new in West Germany, but Israeli pop singer Ofra Haza
is riding an ``ethno-disco'' craze to the top of the charts with
songs in Hebrew and Arabic.
   ``This is probably the first time that a song in Hebrew has
taken the public by storm,'' spokesman Rolf Hoefler of Saturn
Hansa, one of Frankfurt's largest record stores, said of Haza's
``Im Nin Alu'' (``If the Gates of Heaven Closed''), a catchy blend
of folk and funk.
   Haza's album with the English-language title, ``Yemenite
Songs,'' is also a hit.
   ``It has nothing to do with Israeli music per se,'' Hoefler
said. ``There's just a craze right now for non-European music. We
call it `ethno-disco.'''
   The 31-year-old singer, long celebrated in Israel, learned
Yeminite folk songs from her mother, who is from the Yemen Arab
Republic, the Hamburg-based magazine Stern said in a profile Haza.
Her music is a potpourri of languages, folk and disco sounds with a
funk rhythm.

   Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker have become
the most prolific comet hunters of the 20th century, bagging their
14th discovery on Mrs. Shoemaker's 59th birthday.
   The couple discovered their 13th comet on May 13, which tied
them with an Australian astronomer as the most successful comet
hunters of the century. And their 14th on June 24.
   Mrs. Shoemaker said she was scanning photographic negatives of
an asteroid, hoping to find its orbit, when she discovered another
bright, fast-moving object through her stereomicroscope.
   ``It's hard to tell when it's in the Milkyway. There's
wall-to-wall stars,'' she said. ``I decided I'd better let Gene
have a look. `That's a comet,' he said.''
   Comets are chunks of ice and dust that orbit the sun. Between
700 and 800 have been spotted, but as many as a trillion are
believed to exist in the outer solar system.
   Shoemaker, a U.S. Geological Survey research geologist, is
co-investigator on the imaging team of the Voyager 2 spacecraft,
scheduled to pass Neptune next year. Mrs. Shoemaker is an amatuer
astronomer.
   Although they live in Flagstaff, the Shoemakers do their
comet-hunting at Mount Palomar, east of San Diego, using a
wide-field 18-inch telescope to photograph large pieces of the sky.

<HEAD>Judge Stops Hiring of Firefighters During Discrimination Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has forbidden the city to hire
firefighters while the state investigates complaints that physical
tests for the job discriminate against women.
   Ramsey County Judge Joanne Smith issued a temporary injunction
Thursday at the request of state Human Rights Commissioner Steve
Cooper, who said the investigation will take about 45 days. Smith
set a hearing on continuation of the injunction for July 14.
   The complaints were lodged after none of 17 women who recently
took the firefighter test passed.
   The city already has sent offers of employment to 25 men who
passed the test. Before being hired, the men must pass medical
exams and background checks, but Smith specifically prohibited the
fire department from following through on the job offers until the
ban is lifted.
   She included six minority men in the ban, despite a request by
the Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services that they be allowed
to take offered jobs.
   Attorney Bruce Beneke argued that the minorities should be
exempt from the injunction because all but one of them were chosen
under affirmative action hiring rules to reverse racial
discrimination.
   Ten women who failed the test filed a discrimination suit,
claiming the test was rigged to favor physical attributes more
common to men and that the cutoff score was set artificially high.
   The cutoff was determined by 45 volunteers now working as
firefighters who have good, excellent or superior physical ratings.
Firefighters in poorer condition and men in higher ranks were not
allowed to participate in the so-called ``norming test.''
   Women who work as firefighters in nearby Minneapolis also were
not allowed to volunteer.
   St. Paul Fire Chief Steve Conroy said he has 19 openings in his
414-firefighter department, and expects six more through
retirements within the next six months.
   ``Twenty-five is a good percent of the department,'' he said.
``It's bound to affect the overall operation some way. It may be
the difference between four men that we normally have on each truck
and three men if we don't get replacements.''
   But the shortage would likely become a financial burden to the
city before public safety would be threatened, he said. ``We'd have
to go to the city for authorization to bring men in on overtime on
their time off.''

   Jesse Jackson, ensuring he arrives in Atlanta
amid fanfare, will lead a bus tour to the Democratic National
Convention that will name Michael Dukakis its 1988 standard-bearer.
   The three-day ``Jackson Action Rainbow Express'' from Chicago to
Atlanta will make three stops for large pro-Jackson rallies along
the way and will undoubtedly add to the thousands of Jackson
supporters who already were expected to show up in Atlanta.
   Many will have no official access to the convention, so the
campaign is planning to occupy them with a series of rallies and
forums, with an eye toward consolidating a progressive coalition
Jackson hopes to lead in the future.
   Although Jackson is not setting up the bus tour as a caravan,
vehicles are expected to join along the way, said spokeswoman Pam
Smith.
   ``It's a way of involving people. This is a people campaign,''
she said.
   More than 1,100 of the Jackson troops in Atlanta will be
delegates, but others are going south to show support for the
runnerup candidate.
   And some in those ranks are not happy with the way the
Democratic picture is turning out for this election.
   While Jackson, pledging to be a Democratic ticket team player,
has said he wants no disruption of the convention, they may not be
as muted on disagreements with the party platform or a possible
rejection of Jackson by Dukakis as a running mate.
   Jackson ``has a very heavy burden as he tries to balance among
what the different constituencies expect of him,'' said Eleanor
Holmes Norton, a former Carter administration official now heading
Jackson's platform team.
   Some want to see Jackson as vice president, others ``can't
conceive of him in any other role'' than presidential nominee,
while still others are looking toward his leadership of a new
progressive coalition, Norton noted.
   It is not known whether the disgruntled will adhere to what
Jackson's delegate coordinator Joseph Gardner says are the ``the
watchwords for the convention ... discipline, detail and hope.''
   Floor debate over Jackson platform proposals, will be
``constructive, not destructive,'' he said.
   Despite such reassurances, grumbling among some Jackson
supporters is just beneath the surface.
   At least one street demonstration not officially sanctioned by
the campaign is planned by Rep. Gus Savage, a longtime Jackson
friend and ally.
   Savage's staff declined to comment on the intent, but
indications were the rally will call on Dukakis to choose Jackson
for his running mate.
   Walda Katz Fishman, a Washington supporter and sociologist at
Howard University, is organizing a small group of people to travel
to Atlanta. She said that in addition to attending Jackson campaign
events, she will join in protests by other progressive groups that
might be more critical of the Democrats.
   Many people ``thought Jackson was really saying something. Now
they're kind of being told, `Well, all that was just for show,''
she said.
   On the vice presidential question, Jackson's own words have
inflamed supporters' passions as he has repeatedly touted his
qualifications for the post.
   Ron Walters, a Howard University political scientist and
consultant to Jackson's campaign, said, ``Some people have
expressed the sentiment they will not vote if Jackson is not on the
ticket.''
   However, he said, ``there's some way to salvage that'' _ if
Dukakis ``comes up with something important' like adopting some of
Jackson's economic positions.
   Many Jackson backers are disgruntled about the
Dukakis-controlled platform which Walters called ``exceedingly
vague.'' He said it will ``shock a lot of people ... who wanted to
see in the platform a substantial view of their own interest and
constituency.''
   Jackson has filed a dozen minority planks and will decide which
ones to take to a floor fight.
   Among his most controversial proposals are a call for a no-first
use nuclear policy, support for a Palestinian state, a military
budget freeze and a tax hike on the wealthy and corporations.

<HEAD>Group of Armenians Angry About US Immigration Delay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. decision to delay immigration of Soviet
refugees brought bitter disappointment Friday to Armenians who have
waited for years to join relatives in America.
   ``We moved out of our apartments, our homes,'' said Mushegh
Sarafyan, one of about 50 Armenians huddled on a street next to the
U.S. Embassy. ``We sold our clothes and quit our jobs, and now we
are left practically on the street.''
   Sarafyan and the others had come to Moscow from their southern
republic earlier in the week expecting to receive permission to
travel to the United States.
   But embassy spokeswoman Marguerite Squire said the U.S.
Consulate on Monday stopped processing Soviet refugees, most of
whom are Armenians, for travel to the United States.
   ``We want to emphasize this is only a postponement of
departure,'' U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock told reporters.
   Matlock said the U.S. government had run out of money to
resettle Soviet refugees for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
The process is to resume Oct. 1, when a new fiscal year begins, Ms.
Squire said.
   The embassy in June gave permission to a record 2,063 Soviets,
94 percent of whom are Armenians, to immigrate to the United
States. That was more than all of fiscal year 1987.
   The U.S. government has made Soviet emigration restrictions a
key human rights issue in relations between the two countries, and
the Soviets have eased their policy to permit thousands of citizens
who claim family ties in the West to leave the country.
   ``We are ready to start a new life in a new country and what
happens?'' asked Sarafyan. ``Already they are deceiving us.''
   The 50 Armenians said they had received permission after months
or years of waiting from the Soviet government to emigrate, many
hoping to join relatives in Los Angeles. Los Angeles has a large
Armenian population, and California's governor, Republican George
Deukmejian, is of Armenian descent.
   The Armenians said they had sent telegrams protesting the delay
to Deukmejian and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Armenia, in the Caucasus Mountains, has been the scene of
strikes, rallies and violence since February as residents demand
control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region now part of neighboring
Azerbaijan republic.
   The delay affects any Soviet applying to the embassy for
political asylum in the United States. Other than Armenians, the
other major group emigrating, Soviet Jews, generally leave the
Soviet Union on Israeli visas and many then pick up U.S. visas in
Western Europe.
   Sarafyan said the Armenian families now have no place to stay
and few belongings for the three-month wait.
   Matlock called the delays ``very regrettable'' and said the
embassy was trying to warn other Soviets scheduled for departure
interviews of the holdup.
   From Oct. 1, 1987, to this Sept. 30, the embassy expects to
grant 9,500 Soviets, mostly Armenians, permission to resettle in
the United States. From Oct. 1, 1986, to Sept. 30, 1987, 1,800
immigration requests were approved.

   The band that gave the world ``Cretin Hop,''
``Teen-age Lobotomy'' and scores of other short, loud, fast and
somewhat silly punk tunes, is celebrating its 15th anniversary.
   The Ramones _ Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Marky Ramone, who are
not related but took the surname for the stage _ have marked the
milestone recently by releasing ``Ramonesmania,'' a two-record
anthology of their best-known material _ 30 songs all so short they
fit comfortably on one compact disk.
   And except for an occasional guitar solo by Johnny Ramone _ a
lapse some fans equate with selling out _ the anthology shows that
the pioneers of punk pith have stuck to the formula of two-minute,
three-cord head-bangers.
   ``We're a band that our fans can count on,'' Joey Ramone said in
a recent interview. ``We'll always be there for them and won't let
them down. It's nice to hear the fans acknowledge that we aren't
changing, or selling out, or getting soft.''
   Joey Ramone, who wears a mop of black hair exposing only his
mouth and the tip of his nose, said his band is one of about 10
that have ``really captured the spirit of rock 'n' roll.''
   ``I'm very proud to walk down the street and maintain my self
respect, to be told by other artists or fans that they think we're
really great,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Signs Multibillion-Dollar Arms Deal With Saudis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain announced Friday it had signed its
biggest-ever arms deal with Saudi Arabia, supplanting the United
States as the major arms supplier to the oil-rich kingdom.
   A Defense Ministry statement gave no details, but official
sources said the deal _ which includes mine sweepers and some 50
Tornado fighters _ was worth more than $17 billion. That dwarfed a
$7.5 billion contract won by Britain in 1986 to supply Saudi Arabia
with 72 Tornado fighters and other aircraft.
   The ministry statement said the deal, signed Sunday in a
memorandum of understanding, was a new phase of the previous
contract and involved the supply ``of additional aircraft, a
construction program and specialized navy vessels.''
   It included an economic offset program, the statement said,
apparently meaning an agreement to step up British investment in
Saudi Arabia.
   In the Saudi capital of Riyadh, a brief official Saudi statement
confirmed a deal was signed that would ``provide significant
enhancement of the existing defense capabilities'' of Saudi Arabia.
   The deal, a huge boost for the British armaments industry in the
next decade, followed years of British lobbying.
   Unlike the U.S. administration, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government is not constrained by lawmakers protesting
that weapons sales to Saudi Arabia may endanger or offend Israel.
   Official sources said the agreement involved the supply of 50 to
60 Tornado aircraft, 50 to 60 Hawk jet training aircraft, six mine
sweepers for use in the Persian Gulf, 90 helicopters, weapons
systems, and the construction of two Tornado bases.
   The contract also included several civil aircraft for use by the
Saudi royal family, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   British Aerospace, lead contractor for the Tornados, which it
manufacturers with West German and Italian companies, also will
build the two Tornado bases, the sources said. The bases will be at
Dhahran, to cover oil installations in the Persian Gulf, and near
the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the sources said.
   The other major British companies involved are Westland
Helicopters and Vosper Thorneycroft, makers of Sandown class mine
sweepers.
   British sources said the Saudis have ordered Westland's new
Black Hawk helicopter.
   Defense sources said detailed contracts for the whole package
still had to be negotiated.
   Legislator Sir Antony Buck, chairman of the governing
Conservative Party's Defense Committee, said the agreement was ``an
important breakthrough especially as the various pieces of
equipment ... were in hot competition from the French and others.''
   Britain has a long history of arms links with Saudi Arabia and
Mrs. Thatcher has cultivated the relationship since coming to power
in 1979.
   This included apologizing in 1980 to Saudi Arabia after
television companies refused to bow to British government pressure
not to screen a film ``Death of a Princess.'' The fictional story
about the execution of a Saudi princess and her lover offended the
Saudi authorities.

   The Pentagon, the government's largest agency,
is having a difficult time determining how many private consultants
it employs because it still hasn't properly defined the term
``consultant,'' the Defense Department's deputy inspector general
said Friday.
   As a result, the number of consultants and the total value of
their contracts is likely to continue to be underreported, Derek J.
Vander Schaaf told the Senate Governmental Affairs federal service
subcommittee.
   Vander Schaaf told the panel that the Pentagon recently
overhauled its administrative system for overseeing consultants,
but that new regulations to implement the changes have not yet been
published and that ``field (audit) personnel had not been
adequately trained in the application of the consulting service
definitions.''
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency,
recently reported that the Pentagon spent $2.8 billion to $18.8
billion on consultants in fiscal year 1987. The Pentagon reported
spending only $155 million.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee, agreed
with Vander Schaaf that part of the Pentagon's problem in tracking
down all its consultants is the definition of the term.
Consultants, Pryor said, can be called ``contract employees'' or a
variety of other titles.
   The hearing did not focus on the ongoing criminal investigation
of Pentagon fraud and bribery. That probe centers on allegations
that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former
military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   However, Pryor did say that he was angry about the Pentagon's
handling of its apparent procurement problems.
   ``The Pentagon public relations machine is working overtime to
minimize, dodge, shift blame and squirm,'' he said. ``They say the
system is great.''
   ``As a citizen, I'm not only outraged,'' he said. ``I'm ashamed
as a senator for being a part of an institution that knows the
problem, but has been impotent to change it. I'm ashamed of us for
not standing on our desk tops and demanding some public hangings.''
   Pryor's statement, in turn, angered Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
the ranking Republican on the panel.
   ``There's no reason to malign distinguished public servants,''
Stevens told Pryor.
   Part of the problem, Stevens said, is that ``the question of
what or what is not a consultant contract needs to be settled.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., meanwhile, introduced a bill on Friday
that would strengthen the position of undersecretary of defense for
acquisition. The measure centralizes authority within that office,
whereas all four services currently have wide-ranging authority to
sign contracts.
   ``We must do everything possible to correct the inherent
inefficiencies of the current system and to reduce the potential
for abuse,'' Dixon said.
   Meantime, at the House Armed Service Committee, two former
Pentagon acquisition officials differed about the need for new
legislation to fix the procurement system.
   Richard DeLauer, undersecretary for research and engineering
during the first term of the Reagan administration, opposed new
legislation.
   ``If you would support (Defense Secretary) Frank Carlucci in the
next four months, and let him find out what's wrong with it, we
could make some changes,'' DeLauer said. ``He's got the muscle and
is not afraid of stepping on toes.''
   DeLauer described the system as ``sick'' and added, ``Don't ask
me to give it a grade.''
   But James Wade, assistant secretary for acquisition in 1985-86,
proposed that a law be passed to establish a single, civilian
``defense acquisition corps'' with procurement authority over all
the services.
   ``I think the bureaucracy fights change,'' Wade testified. ``The
system is failing and getting worse. We're not going to make
structural changes in the heat of a political campaign. More
tinkering at the margins will actually hurt the system.''
   DeLauer also criticized former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, saying, ``Cap did not have an interest in really
understanding in depth the whole procurement process. It was not
his interest and he did not understand it. And he delegated. And
unfortunately he delegated it to anybody who would pick it up.''

   President Lee Teng-hui rose to the top of
the ruling Nationalist Party as the handpicked successor to Chiang
Ching-kuo, the strongman leader who in his final days began to
bring democratic change to this prosperous island.
   Lee, 65, is the first native Taiwanese to lead the Nationalist
Party, or Kuomintang, which was formed 94 years ago on the Chinese
mainland by Sun Yat-sen and still claims to be the legitimate ruler
of all China.
   He became president and acting party chairman after the Jan. 13
death of Chiang, the son of Chiang Kai-shek, ended four decades of
family rule on Taiwan.
   Chiang Ching-kuo had chosen Lee to be his vice president in 1984
over several more prominent native Taiwanese officials.
   Lee, a low-key vice president, quickly gained popularity after
ascending to the presidency, frequently touring the island.
   He also showed respect to the old-guard Nationalist officials
who arrived from mainland China in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek by
frequently consulting with them.
   ``Taiwanese respect and love him, and mainlanders dare not
defame him,'' said Peng Huai-en, associate professor of politics at
Chinese Culture University.
   Lee has vowed support for the liberalization program begun by
Chiang Ching-kuo, who lifted martial law, ended a ban on opposition
parties and promised to give Taiwanese a greater say in the
government long dominated by Nationalists from the Chinese mainland
who lost a civil war to the Communists.
   The new party leader, an agricultural economic expert, also has
questioned Taiwan's conservative financial policies.
   Lee has moved cautiously, however, to not antagonize elderly
Nationalist conservatives wary about the quick pace of change
Chiang Ching-kuo introduced.
   Political analysts describe Lee as a tactful politician. A keen
student of Japanese fencing known as Kendo, Lee has told visitors
he beat more than 100 challengers in high school by ``prevailing
over a move by remaining still,'' meaning to wait for the opponent
to make the first move.
   At the age of 42, he left his teaching post at a Taiwan
university to study in the United States, where he earned a
doctorate from Cornell University.
   He has published several works on agriculture and economics.
   A Christian, Lee is married and has two daughters. He plays golf
and plays the violin.

<HEAD>NPR Says McKay Concluded Meese Could Have Been Indicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent counsel James McKay concluded
Attorney General Edwin Meese III could have been charged in
connection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Bell telephone
stock, but decided against prosecution, National Public Radio
reported Friday.
   NPR quoted unidentified sources as saying Meese's lawyers were
told toward the end of the 14-month investigation that at least
technically, McKay determined Meese could have been charged with
two felonies. NPR said it could not determine what McKay's reasons
were for not proceeding with a criminal case.
   Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, Meese's attorneys, declined to
discuss the NPR report, saying in a statement that McKay's decision
not to prosecute Meese ``is, in every real sense, a vindication''
of the attorney general.
   The statement added that ``the avenue'' by which McKay ``arrived
at that result or the rationale he employed is entirely beside the
point.''
   Federal law prohibits any official from participating personally
and substantially in any matter in which he or his family has a
financial interest. Sources familiar with the probe, speaking on
condition of anonymity, have said McKay was examining a possible
violation by Meese against the provisions of this federal
conflict-of-interest law.
   Meese met in 1985 and 1986 with executives of four regional Bell
companies which wanted the Justice Department to switch its
position and urge that restrictions on the types of business they
could engage in be lifted. Early in 1987, a few weeks after he
obtained a White House waiver allowing him to make a decision
despite his stock holdings, Meese approved a reversal of Justice
Department stand, recommending to a federal judge that the regional
Bell companies be allowed to enter new lines of business.
   Meese's waiver, granted by the White House counsel's office, was
based partly on erroneous information supplied by one of Meese's
aides, Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have said. Meese's office underestimated the value of
the stock, saying it was worth $9,600 instead of $14,000.
   In granting the waiver, the White House counsel's office
mischaracterized Meese as having sold the stock. In fact, Meese had
transferred the stock to someone else, as a Meese aide had
explained to the department's Office of Legal Counsel, which
supplied the White House with the information on which the waiver
was based. Meese was still the legal owner of the stock, a number
of legal experts said earlier this year. In fact, the attorney
general finally retrieved his telephone holdings last year and sold
them.
   The person to whom the stock had been transferred was Meese's
investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn, who is currently under
indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.
   Also in granting the waiver, the White House counsel's office
told Meese that ``you indicate that you have no financial interest
in or immediate family relationship with the new owner of the
stock.'' In fact, Meese and his wife had entered a partnership with
Chinn's corporation.
   McKay's office filed an 830-page report Tuesday on his criminal
investigation of Meese, which remains under seal. Hours later,
Meese announced he was resigning effective in late July or early
August.
   McKay's report has been referred to the Justice Department
office of Solicitor General Charles Fried, who has the authority to
send it to the department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
OPR, which investigates alleged improper activity inside the
Justice Department, could then conduct an ethics review of Meese's
activities.
   Department spokesman Mark Sheehan declined to comment when asked
whether Fried had sent the report to OPR. The Washington Times
reported that the report was sent to that office Thursday.
   The federal appeals court panel which appointed McKay issued an
order Wednesday directing that copies of the report be sent to
Fried and to Meese's lawyers. The order, which is under seal,
contained language saying the recipients of the report were to
discuss the contents with no one. According to sources familiar
with the probe, the court issued a clarification Thursday, also
under seal, specifying that sending the report to Fried was a
formal referral, enabling the solicitor general to share the report
with OPR if he thought that step was necessary.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk said Friday that his anti-Vietnamese ally, the
Khmer Rouge, opposes an international peacekeeping force in
Cambodia because it wants to retake power.
   Sihanouk said the communist Khmer Rouge and its enemy, the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia, have the same stand _
``they are opposed to the sending of an international peacekeeping
force'' after a political settlement of the 9-year-old war.
   ``Why? Because the Khmer Rouge, they want to retake power, to
take our Cambodia like (they did) in April 1975 after the departure
of foreign troops.''
   Sihanouk talked to reporters after meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz. The two men were in Bangkok for
consultations between foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and Western allies.
   Shultz gave Sihanouk a letter from President Reagan declaring
that the prince has a central role in a Cambodian settlement and
the Khmer Rouge must not return, said State Department spokesman
Charles Redman. Reagan assured Sihanouk the United States will
continue to pressure Vietnam until all its troops leave Cambodia,
Redman said.
   Fears of a Khmer Rouge return to power have heightened as
Vietnam has begun a claimed withdrawal of 50,000 troops and the
Khmer Rouge has been reported storing arms for an offensive.
   The Khmer Rouge seized power with the fall of the U.S.-backed
Lon Nol government in 1975 and killed hundreds of thousands of
people until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   The Khmer Rouge is now the most powerful group in a three-party
guerrilla coalition headed by Sihanouk.
   During this week's consultations, Japan announced it would
consider funding an international peacekeeping force. Sihanouk said
Friday that the United Nations must dispatch a strong enough force
``to prevent the Khmer Rouge ... from taking our Cambodia.''
   Sihanouk said it wasn't possible to disarm the Khmer Rouge's
40,000 troops because the main source of weapons, China, was not in
favor of that.
   He favors forming a national army comprising the three guerrilla
groups and the pro-Hanoi government.
   The prince charged that Vietnam also wanted the Khmer Rouge to
return to power so it could again invade Cambodia after its stated
plan to pull out by 1990 and tell world leaders that it was
preventing a Khmer Rouge takeover.
   Shultz met Friday with Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda of
Thailand, which gives sanctuary to Khmer Rouge guerrillas, and they
agreed that the Khmer Rouge ``should not be allowed to have a
leading role'' in a future government, Radio Thailand said.
   Also Friday, Sihanouk and Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali
Alatas, said they would attend peace talks on Cambodia planned for
July 25 despite Vietnam's threats to cancel its pledge to
participate. The talks in Indonesia's capital of Jakarta would be
the first to involve all the warring parties.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Congress on Kuwaiti Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department accused Congress on
Friday of causing confusion about U.S. ties to Arab countries by
seeking to strip potent missiles from F-18 jet fighters being sold
to Kuwait.
   Concern that the air-to-ground Mavericks could be used against
Israel prompted the Senate on Thursday to remove the missiles from
the $1.8 billion arms purchase by the Persian Gulf state.
   Withholding the missiles would make the jets ineffective,
department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``Moreover,'' she said, ``it creates confusion about the
direction of U.S. policy in the gulf. Congress and the
administration have long encouraged our friends in the gulf to
share more of the burden of defending the region. Consequently, we
are concerned about this situation.''
   The State Department in the past few weeks has also voiced
concern about the proliferation of missiles in the Gulf and the
Middle East.
   But Mrs. Oakley said the air-to-fround Mavericks ticketed for
Kuwait were not in the same category as ballistic rockets and did
not pose a threat to peace. ``Clearly, we've supplied various
missiles in defense of our national interest,'' she said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described
President Reagan as ``dismayed at the precipitate action taken by
the Senate.''
   He said ``the Senate action _ taken in a matter of minutes
without the benefit of committee hearings or deliberation _ is
unfortunate and damaging to U.S. foreign policy interests.''
   ``Congress has repeatedly asked what the gulf states are doing
for their own defense,'' he said. ``Kuwait has answered that they
wish do more and have indicated their preference to work with us in
doing so _ yet some in the Senate apparently wish to reject this
request and have Kuwait turn elsewhere.''
   The State Department has lobbied for congressional support of
the Maverick sale to Kuwait as vital to the Arab sheikdom's defense
against Iran.
   ``By helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibility
for its own defense it complements our highly successful escort
operations,'' Peter Burleigh, the deputy secretary for Near Eastern
affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday.
   He referred to the U.S. Navy's escort of merchant ships carrying
oil through the Persian Gulf.
   A key congressional opponent of the Maverick purchase, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Arab countries buying U.S. arms should
be required to ``renounce the use of force and recognize the right
of Israel to exist.''
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States would maintain its commitment
to Israel that it have a military margin of safety over the
combined forces of hostile Arab countries.
   At the same time, she said, ``some of our objectives in the gulf
are to prove that we are a reliable partner in the legitimate
self-defense needs of friendly gulf Arab states.''
   On Friday, Britain announced it would sell Saudi Arabia 72
Tornado jet fighters and other weapons in a $7.5 billion deal.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States did not oppose the deal ``in
principle'' but did not know all the vital details, including
whether the British had imposed restrictions to minimize any
potential threat to Israel.
   ``Clearly, we would have preferred to make these sales
ourselves,'' she said.
   Asked if the purchase hurt U.S. interests, the spokeswoman said:
``Of course, we think it does hurt American interests. We think our
interests are better served when we can sell legitimate
self-defense items to friendly Arab countries, when we can consult
with them, when we can put the restrictions on them that prevent
threats to other countries.''

<HEAD>Summer Boom For Teenagers Drops Jobless Rate To 5.3 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boom in summertime work for teen-agers
dropped the nation's unemployment rate to a 14-year low, 5.3
percent, the government said Friday. Joblessness among black youths
plummeted more than 6 percentage points to its lowest level on
record.
   The 0.3 percentage point drop from May's 5.6 percent jobless
rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820,000 people _
three-fourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old _ onto America's
payrolls, the Labor Department said.
   Including an unusual decline of 536,000 in the number of people
at work in May, employment increases had been averaging only 90,000
a month this year until June.
   The government's raw data showed 1.4 million more teen-agers at
work in June than in May, dropping the adjusted unemployment rate
among them 2 percentage points to 13.6 percent, the lowest since
early 1970.
   Among black teens, joblessness dropped from 34.8 percent in May
to 28.4 percent last month, the lowest since the government began
keeping separate data on them in 1972 and the first time since late
1973 that it has dipped below 30 percent.
   Analysts had anticipated a large increase this year in the usual
number of available summer jobs, especially in the tourist
industry, as foreigners taking advantage of the devalued American
dollar flock to the United States for their vacations.
   However, some were skeptical that overall job growth and the
consequent decline in the unemployment rate was as great as it
appeared in June figures.
   ``Anything in the report that deals with summer workers will
look better than it is,'' said Larry Chimerine, president of the
WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``The
July report will be the purest indication because that's all
summer.''
   The Labor Department acknowledged its June figures were affected
in part by the fact its survey was conducted late in the month,
``allowing extra time for students, graduates and seasonal workers
to find jobs.''
   As a result, according to Chimerine, the ``filters'' used to
adjust the total figures treated some of the normal seasonal
increase as non-summer employment.
   The numbers were good enough for President Reagan to claim them
as ``solid evidence'' that his economic policies have worked, and
he put in a thinly veiled plug for Vice President George Bush.
   ``I predict that 1988 will be a banner year for Republicans
because it's a banner year for peace and prosperity in America,''
he said. ``As they sit around their kitchen tables, more Americans
are planning for their future, not desperately searching the want
ads for jobs.''
   The numbers were not so good for Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis. Unemployment in the Massachusetts
governor's state jumped from 2.8 percent to 3.5 percent.
   But it was the first time in more than four years that
Massachusetts has not had the lowest unemployment rate of the
nation's 11 largest states. It's rate in June was equaled by New
York and exceeded by North Carolina, where joblessness dropped from
3.5 percent in May to 3.2 percent last month.
   Nationwide, the number of unemployed fell by 328,000 in June to
6.5 million, with teen-agers and adult men accounting for all of
the decline. And the percentage of working-age Americans holding
jobs climbed to 62.3 percent, an all-time high matched only once
before _ in April.
   Construction employment rose by 55,000 and factories added
45,000 new workers, 20,000 more than their average monthly increase
from January through May.
   ``There are no signs that a growing economy driven by exports
and capital equipment investment is slowing down,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Jasinowski said manufacturers are begining to run up against
labor shortages and predicting that if employment growth continues
at its June pace there will be an acceleration of wage inflation by
Christmas.
   Some other economists also echoed those fears, although there
was no indication of any wage spike in June. Average hourly wages
actually fell by 2 cents to $9.23 last month after rising at an
annual rate of 6 percent in April and May.
   ``Over the past six months as we've watched the unemployment
figures, we've seen no signs of inflation at this point,'' said
Labor Secretary Anne McLaughlin.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of government officials gathered on
Friday to map strategy for safeguarding sensitive information
stored in federal computer systems, ranging from desktop models to
big mainframe facilities.
   ``We must give the federal government's computers a model for
security and reliability,'' said James Burrows, director of the
Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology at the National
Bureau of Standards.
   He spoke to about 700 officials from agencies throughout the
government who met at the bureau's headquarters in suburban
Gaithersburg, Md., to receive formal guidelines for implementing an
ambitious new computer security program.
   Charged with overseeing the program are NBS, a unit of the
Commerce Department, and the Pentagon's National Security Agency,
which for years has issued regulations for protecting classified
information.
   Other lead agencies for the program are the White House Office
of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management.
   The effort is mandated by legislation signed into law early this
year by President Reagan, requiring that agencies establish
computer security training and awareness programs, identify
sensitive computer systems, prepare security plans for each system
and submit those plans to NBS and NSA for advice and comment.
   Due to be formulated by next January, the security plans are
intended to help deal with unauthorized computer system break-ins
by ``hackers'' as well as the threat posed by so-called computer
viruses _ small strings of computer code that can cause computer
programs to go haywire.
   Anthony C. Taylor, a technical consultant to the House Science,
Space and Technology Committee, said a recent survey of federal
agencies by the General Accounting Office had ``confirmed our worst
fears'' in finding that many computer managers are ``largely
unaware of the threats to their systems.''
   He told the meeting that although the danger from hacker
break-ins has been widely publicized, ``far greater damage comes
not from hackers but from insiders'' at agencies who may attempt to
steal, damage or destroy sensitive data.
   The computer security program faces a possible budget squeeze
because Congress so far has been unwilling to vote the additional
$3 million for NBS requested by the Reagan administration to pay
for implementing the program.
   A fiscal 1989 bill passed by the House includes no extra money
for the program, while companion legislation approved by a Senate
appropriations panel would provide only $1 million. Capitol Hill
proponents of the computer security program are expected to press
for full funding on the Senate floor and in a Senate-House
conference.

   Gov. Rose Mofford will not be charged in
connection with gifts she gave as secretary of state or financial
disclosure statements she filed as a public official, the county
attorney announced today.
   Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins said technical violations
in the statements were not ``significant in that they did not
involve large amounts of money or personal gain for Governor
Mofford.''
   Mrs. Mofford was not available for comment immediately, but
aides issued a statement on her behalf.
   ``Obviously I am relieved that this investigation has concluded
and I can continue to lead Arizona without any doubts about my
integrity,'' it said. ``It feels good to be exonerated from these
charges because every decision I have ever made in public service
has been for the benefit of the state of Arizona.''
   The gifts, Collins said in a statement, were ``given in the
state interest in Governor Mofford's official capacity'' and ``they
lack any clear element of personal gain in a thoroughly private
capacity.''
   State Attorney General Bob Corbin had asked Collins' office to
investigate omissions from financial-disclosure statements Mrs.
Mofford filed over the last 10 years and at thousands of dollars in
state money that went for gifts and office decorations while she
was secretary of state.
   Sources close to the probe said before the announcement that
investigators had concluded Mrs. Mofford had broad authority to
spend money. They also said the investigators had concentrated in
fairly narrow areas. For example, they said, no one was able to
discover to whom most of the gifts went, so Mrs. Mofford was taken
at her word that they went to appropriate people.
   And while they found some evidence of payments by Mrs. Mofford
of bills that her late husband incurred, sources said the
investigators had been unable to locate a will for T.R. Mofford
that could have helped prove or disprove her claim that items
omitted from her disclosure statements were not really hers because
they were being used to pay her former husband's debts.
   The investigation began after The Associated Press reported in
April that Mrs. Mofford had failed to list numerous land, loan and
partnership dealings in financial disclosure forms covering the
past 10 years.
   As secretary of state, Mrs. Mofford was in charge of ensuring
that forms were easy to fill out. She initially referred to the AP
story as nit-picking, but later filed amended reports, saying she
had made ``an honest mistake'' and didn't feel she had to list some
items because she was using the proceeds to pay off bills T.R.
Mofford incurred after their divorce but before he died.
   The investigation was broadened in May after the AP reviewed
five years of bills from the secretary of state's office and found
more than $50,000 spent on items including a joke-writing service,
kachina dolls and 30 expensive watches.
   The review also found that Mrs. Mofford had bought $10,000 worth
of U.S. and Arizona flags from unauthorized vendors at higher
prices than they could have cost if purchased from state-approved
vendors.
   Mrs. Mofford refused to discuss the disclosures, but said in a
statement that a $2,400 appropriation in her 1980-81 budget for
``other'' items and later lump-sum budgets gave her authority to
purchase gifts for visiting dignitaries, Arizonans who gave
outstanding service and groups that ``advance civic pride.''

   A ``minor degradation'' in radar aboard the
USS Vincennes was repaired before the warship entered the Persian
Gulf and played no role in the vessel's failure to correctly
identify the Iranian airliner it shot down last weekend, a Navy
spokesman said Friday.
   Other Pentagon officials said they were awaiting results of an
investigation to learn why the Vincennes missed air traffic
communications and other clues indicating that the Iran Air A300
Airbus was a civilian plane and not an F-14 fighter, as officers
aboard the ship believed.
   The chief of Iran's air force, Brig. Gen. Mansour Satari, told
reporters in Tehran on Thursday that U.S. systems should have been
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the
jetliner and the airport control tower in Bandar Abbas, near the
mouth of the Persian Gulf.
   But Pentagon spokesman said they were not sure U.S. forces in
the gulf were monitoring, or were able to monitor, air traffic
control communications at the time of the incident.
   ``We are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help
clarify the issue,' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   As the Vincennes steamed from its home port in San Diego toward
the gulf in May, said Navy spokesman Lt. Brian Cullin, an
unspecified part in the ship's sophisticated Spy-1 radar proved to
be unreliable.
   A replacement was flown to the Arabian Sea, outside the gulf,
the repair made and the Vincennes ``was fully operational on June
6, before she entered the gulf,'' Cullin said. The ship reported to
the battle group in the Arabian Sea on May 22, he said.
   The $1 billion ship's Aegis radar and tracking complex, of which
Spy-1 is part, mistook the Airbus for an Iranian F-14 fighter and
shot it down with all 290 civilians aboard last Sunday. Since then,
Pentagon officials have been trying to figure out why.
   In other developments Friday:
   _President Reagan said the question of compensation for the
families of those killed in the incident is one issue ``under
consideration.'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there
were ``still some open questions'' on the compensation issue. He
said messages of condolence had gone to the victims' families in
Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, India, Yugoslavia and
Italy.
   _Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the United States should adopt a new stance in the
Iran-Iraq war ``equidistant'' between the two warring countries.
``I do believe that we'd be much better served in trying to end the
war if we were really in a position of condemning both attacks by
Iran and by Iraq and also condemning the chemical warfare being
conducted against innocent people by Iraq,'' he said.
   At his Tehran news conference, Satari said the downing of the
Airbus showed that the American military was ``unable ... to
control its sophisticated systems.''
   U.S. officials said the mistake was made, in part, because Iran
Air Flight 655 was broadcasting an identification signal on a
frequency used only by military airplanes, as well as sending a
signal on a channel used by both civilian and military aircraft.
   The Iranian general said destruction of the plane was an
``intentional and unprovoked attack,'' but he later qualified this
by saying the U.S. military ``accepted on purpose'' the risk of
shooting down civilian planes because they were unable to control
their sophisticated systems.
   And he said Iran had ``all the tapes needed'' to prove that
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down.
   The chief Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said Thursday that
Defense Department officials ``don't know whether (U.S. forces in
the gulf) were listening to the control tower or not. We will learn
that in the course of the investigation'' being directed by Rear
Adm. William M. Fogarty.
   Tapes from the Vincennes were flown from the gulf for analysis
in the United States, said Howard. He said the tapes contain data
from the Aegis system, but he was unable to say whether they
included voice communications among the ship's officers, U.S.
commanders in the gulf and in the United States, or any intercepted
Iranian transmissions.
   ``It is probable that their highest priority at the moment was
not listening to the air traffic control radio discussions at
Bandar Abbas, said Howard. ``There are many, many radio
frequencies. ... It would take a heck of a lot of people to monitor
all of them.''
   Howard declined to explain whether U.S. satellites, aircraft and
vessels routinely monitor Iranian radio communications, calling it
``an area of intelligence (that) I won't comment on ....''
   Another Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that air traffic conversations are usually carried on VHF
wavelengths, which are best received when the transmitter is within
site of the receiver, as would be the case of an airliner near an
airport.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe,
said last Sunday that no American surveillance or attack planes
were in the air near the incident, decreasing chances that U.S.
forces might have been able to overhear the air traffic
conversations.
   Crowe also said the aircraft made no voice transmissions after
it was picked by U.S. radar, a statement the Iranian appeared to
challenge.
   Another dispute centered on whether the airliner, which Howard
described as 27 minutes off schedule, was within the commercial air
corridor.
   Howard said the plane was 4{ miles from the center of the
corridor. According to the code governing international air
flights, he said, ``commercial airliners, those carrying
passengers, are expected to adhere to the centerline of the
airway.''
   In Tehran, Satari said the plane was traveling in ``the center
of the international air corridor'' between Bandar Abbas and Dubai
and could have deviated 10 miles either side but still have been
within the corridor.

million, the government said Friday.
   The Treasury Department said June sales were $40 million lower
than in May. Sales had dropped 0.9 percent in May and 6.4 percent
in April. Before that, they rose for eight months in a row, hitting
$706 million in March. June sales were 13 percent higher than a

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
was planning a mission to rescue eight American hostages in Lebanon
when he was kidnapped by pro-Iranian forces, the chief PLO
spokesman was quoted as saying Friday.
   The plan was disclosed in a transcript of Higgins' interrogation
by his abductors, Bassam Abu Sharif was quoted as saying in the
Beirut daily Ad-Diyar.
   ``We have seen a transcript of the interrogation with Higgins,''
he told the newspaper during what it described as a pre-dawn
telephone interview.
   Asked about the report, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley replied, ``Nonsense.''
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was chief of a 76-member observer
group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped Feb. 17 near the southern port city of Tyre.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem faction, claimed responsibility for Higgins' abduction,
charging he was a CIA spy. The United States and UNIFIL denied the
charge.
   The group said in April that Higgins would be turned over to a
tribunal for ``to try him for the crimes he has committed.''
   ``We know from seeing the transcript of interrogation with
Higgins ... that he was preparing a large-scale operation under the
slogan of rescuing all the American hostages,'' Abu Sharif told the
newspaper, which is based in Christian east Beirut.
   He did not say how the Palestine Liberation Organization
obtained the purported transcript.
   The interview also quoted him as saying that Higgins ``had
headed the operations department of the U.S. Delta Force and had
arrived in Lebanon wearing (the U.N.'s) blue beret.''
   The Delta Force was set up to act against terrorism and other
threats to American interests.
   He also said the ousting from Beirut of guerrillas loyal to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat's was part of a plan by the United States
and Syria.
   Arafat's loyalists Friday evacuated the Bourj el-Barajneh
refugee camp, their last stronghold in Beirut, after it fell to
Syrian-backed PLO dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising
faction.
   Abu Sharif also charged that the Lebanese army is supposed to
``clean'' east Beirut from right-wing Christian militiamen of the
Lebanese Forces.
   ``Lebanese and Syrian army troops will later deploy throughout
the greater Beirut to supervise the election of a Lebanese
president accepted by America and Syria,'' Abu Sharif said.
   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires on Sept. 23.
   Abu Sharif did not say whether the alleged plan calls for a
Syrian crackdown on the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
the umbrella group believed holding foreigners in Lebanon.
Hezbollah still controls a barracks in the southern slums where the
18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson of Lorain, Ohio. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings, who last
month announced he would support presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson in the roll call at the Democratic convention, is
cautioning certain nominee Michael Dukakis against overly
accommodating Jackson.
   ``It was ill-advised under (1984 Democratic nominee Walter)
Mondale and now to fall into this same thing of calling him in is
not well-advised,'' Hollings said Thursday.
   Mondale was accused of pandering to Jackson in an effort to not
alienate black voters during the 1984 campaign.
   While Hollings reiterated his support for Jackson at the
national convention in Atlanta later this month, he indicated he
would not take a lead role in lobbying for him.
   ``I'll certainly have a good word for him,'' Hollings said.
``... I'll cast my vote for him and we'll see what happens.''
   Hollings declined to discuss the merits of those named as
possible Dukakis running mates, including Jackson, but he said he
leans toward Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   The South Carolina Democrat suggested Bentsen could draw votes
away from the oil-dependent states where Vice President George Bush
is strong.

   The Piper Alpha platform explosion is expected to
cost insurers more than $1 billion in claims, a spokesman for the
Lloyd's of London insurance market said Friday.
   David Larner, a spokesman for the Lloyd's insurance market, said
the insurance costs ``look as though they could top a billion
dollars. It would make it the largest loss in the North Sea and
probably the largest loss on any one unit.''
   A unit is one item, as opposed to the myriad of related claims
prompted from wider disasters.
   Also on Friday, more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil
rigs in the North Sea quit over general concerns about safety in
the North Sea oil industry.
   In addition, Occidental Petroleum's stock fell 25 cents more, to
$26 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, after
shedding 62.5 cents the day before.
   But oil prices retreated and trading calmed down after hectic
dealings Thursday after the fire broke out on the platform off the
coast of Scotland, killing 166 people in the world's worst oil rig
disaster. The company said it believed a gas leak was responsible.
   In addition to the Piper oil field, five other fields were shut
down, which meant production was cut up to 250,000 barrels a day,
or about one-tenth of the total output of the North Sea's British
sector. A barrel is 42 gallons.
   The oil markets relaxed when they realized that all but the
Piper's production of 167,200 barrels a day should come back fairly
quickly, said Chris Grudniewicz, an oil analyst with the London
investment firm Smith New Court Ltd.
   In the separate West Sole gas field, from 100 to 150 workers who
are employed by a contractor refurbishing three British Petroleum
Co. PLC platforms resigned over safety concerns in the North Sea in
general, BP confirmed.
   A BP spokesman said the workers issued a letter saying they
resigned ``due to current offshore working conditions in general in
the offshore industry.''
   The BP spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
negotiations between the contractor, Press Offshore Services
Division, and its employees were in progress.
   Occidental Petroleum said in a statement Thursday that the
company has ``adequate insurance to handle the situation in the
North Sea.''
   The company insured the rig, plus the costs of any loss of life
claims, salvaging the rig, redrilling and any pollution, Larner
said.
   The $1 billion figure dwarfs the estimated $172 million in
insurance costs for the previous worst North Sea disaster, the 1980
capsizing of the Alexander L. Kielland rig, which killed 123
people, according to Press Association, the domestic news agency.
   Occidental Petroleum said Thursday the destruction of the
platform would cut the company's annual profit by about 5 percent
to 10 percent.
   Occidental's profit in 1987 was $240 million, or $1.06 a share,
on revenue of $17.75 billion.

<HEAD>Soviet Livestock Production Seen Rising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent advances made by the Soviet Union in
the production of livestock products should continue well into the
1990s if some technical and policy problems can be smoothed out, an
Agriculture Department analyst said Friday.
   A drive to increase meat and dairy production to upgrade Soviet
diets has been an important factor in Moscow's decisions to import
large quantities of U.S. grains when domestic harvests have been
short.
   ``The policies now in place or in the process of implementation
portend improved performance compared with the late 1970s and early
1980s, but they will leave substantial productivity potential
unrealized,'' said Edward C. Cook of the department's Economic
Research Service.
   Between 1982 and 1987, increases in Soviet output of meat and
milk ``marked a notably reversal of the downtrends'' between 1977
and 1982, Cook wrote in a new report about the Soviet Union's
livestock sector.
   Milk yields increased per cent a year after 1982, and the
per-head productivity of hogs and cattle increased 2 percent and
3.4 percent a year, respectively.
   ``Prospects for Soviet livestock production hinge on how much
the technical approaches, particularly improvements in feed
supplies, will be pushed in coming years,'' Cook said. ``A lack of
coherence has continued to hinder the broad policies addressing
pricing, farm finances and agro-industrial integration.''
   Cook said that without smoothing out these problems, Moscow's
policies can accomplish ``little more than modest improvement'' in
the livestock sector.

   Military commanders must tell soldiers and
airmen testing positive for the AIDS virus that they face discharge
or prosecution if they don't tell sex partners of their condition
and use condoms, under new Army and Air Force regulations.
   Defense lawyers in an AIDS-related court-martial scheduled to
start the week of July 25 at Fort Huachuca in southeastern Arizona
have argued that the defendant had not been ordered either to use
condoms or to inform partners.
   Spelled out under the regulations, and a similar Navy policy,
are rules of behavior at issue in a number of cases in which
military personnel who have tested positive for the AIDS virus have
been charged with criminal offenses, from aggravated assault to
having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results.
   The military services require all personnel to submit to AIDS
blood screening tests, which detect the presence of antibodies and
indicate whether a person has been exposed to the virus.
   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said
recently the Army regulation, which became effective April 1,
requires a commander to discuss a written counseling statement with
any soldier who has tested positive and has received medical
counseling.
   It says the commander is ``imposing the following restrictions:
`You will verbally advise all prospective sexual partners of your
diagnosed condition prior to engaging in any sexual intercourse.
You are also ordered to use condoms should you engage in sexual
intercourse with a partner.'''
   The form also states that failure ``to adhere to your previous
medical counseling or the counseling I have just given you will
subject you to administrative separation and-or punishment under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice as I see fit.''
   ``This is serious business,'' Rixon said. ``Those words take the
form of a direct order.''
   ``We don't order them to refrain from sex. I don't think we
could do that,'' said Col. Harry Beans, staff judge advocate at
Fort Huachuca, 75 miles southeast of Tucson. But partners must be
informed ``so that he or she can make an informed decision.''
   The upcoming court-martial of Pvt. Adrian G. Morris Jr.,
initiated by the Army in 1987, was the military's first
AIDS-related prosecution. Morris, then a private first class, is
accused of failing to warn three soldiers with whom he had sex,
including one man, that he had tested positive for the virus, and
to use condoms.
   His lawyers have argued that there was no order for Morris to do
either in July 1986, when he was informed of the virus' potential
danger and counseled that he should inform partners and use a
condom.
   Morris' court-martial was delayed pending appeal of a blood test
admissibility ruling.
   Last December, a soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, pleaded guilty to
AIDS-related charges, including disobeying an officer's order
virtually identical to the new regulation.
   In addition, several other military AIDS-related cases have been
tried, including that of a Fort Sill, Okla., soldier who pleaded
guilty to aggravated assault and of an airman at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Ohio, who was convicted on such a charge.
   Recurrence of the element of assault in the cases made clear
``that we needed a very definitive guideline to assure there is a
standardization of orders,'' Rixon said.
   The Air Force regulation, like the Army's, provides a form both
the affected airman and his or her commander must sign,
acknowledging that the person has been given the directive and
understands it.
   The Air Force order also requires people carrying the AIDS virus
to inform medical personnel treating them.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Kenneth Ross in Washington said a Navy policy
took effect in January, telling affected sailors that if they do
not tell their sex partners of their test status they face
administrative or disciplinary measures. Ross said he knew of no
requirement that a commander issue a direct order to affected
individuals.

   Six cars of a packed express passenger
train derailed and plunged into a rain-swollen lake in southern
Kerala state Friday, killing 85 people and injuring 500 others,
authorities said.
   The death toll was expected to rise because up to 200 people
were missing.
   The United News of India news agency said as many as 250 people
were feared dead. The figure could not be independently confirmed.
   Six brick-red passenger cars tumbled into the 20- to
30-foot-deep Lake Asthamudi and were submerged, while three others
dangled from the bridge, said I.K. Chari, a spokesman for the
Indian Railways Ministry.
   Rescuers worked under flood lights as navy divers searched
submerged cars for survivors and bodies, an official at the
accident site told The Associated Press by telephone.
   Kerala Railways Minister A. Neelalohitadasan Nadar said he
suspected poor maintenance of tracks was the cause of the accident.
   It is monsoon season in coastal Kerala, a state known for its
palm-fringed backwaters. It had rained heavily earlier Friday and
was drizzling when the cars derailed near Quilon, about 30 miles
north of the state capital of Trivandrum.
   The engine and one coach of the 14-car Island Express crossed a
bridge over the lake before the passenger cars derailed about 1:15
p.m., Chari said. Four of the last cars remained on the track.
   Dozens of fishermen in long, narrow boats joined in rescue
operations below the bridge, which is about 15 feet above the water.
   Dr. Fritz Mario Saldana, a dentist, told the news agency that he
saved himself inside a submerged car by clinging to a ceiling fan
and keeping his head above the rising water. He praised fishermen
who were at the site within minutes to save trapped passengers.
   Among those killed were 60 men, 20 women and five children,
according to Vellu Kutty, head constable in Quilon.
   At least 192 people were hospitalized in Quilon and Trivandrum
after the accident, including 23 who were critically injured, said
Matthew John, a safety official for the Indian Railways Ministry.
Others were released after treatment.
   Most of the passengers on the train, which was heading from
Bangalore to Trivandrum, were military personnel and government
officials heading home for the weekend, railway officials said.
   John said the train can carry up to 1,700 passengers and usually
is crowded on Fridays.
   Television and Indian news agency reports said the cars plunged
into the water after part of the 540-foot bridge caved in, but
railway officials said the cause was not yet known.
   ``It will take a lot of investigation to determine whether it
was sabotage or something wrong with the tracks,'' said S.P.
Sharma, director of the safety division of the Railways Ministry.
   John said two spans of the bridge were damaged by the accident.
   Nadar told the United News of India that he discussed bad
maintenance with railway officials recently but the officials did
not pay much attention.
   Dr. Thomas Verghese, deputy director of the Quilon district
hospital, told The Associated Press by telephone that the death
toll was expected to rise because three cars still were under water.
   ``We have been very busy with the tragedy. We are well equipped
to handle the tragedy,'' He said.
   Trains are the major form of transport in India, carrying about
9 million people daily. The vast network of the railways stretches
over 38,347 miles of rail lines.
   Train accidents in India are common, often taking dozens of
lives. The Railway Ministry announced in Parliament in February
that 227 people were killed in 613 train accidents during 1987.
   The worst train accident in India is listed in the Guiness Book
of Records as the world's worst, claiming more than 800 lives when
a train plunged into a river in the eastern state of Bihar in June
1981.

   A federal magistrate in Virginia agreed today
to give attorneys for defense consultant Melvyn Paisley a detailed
affidavit FBI agents filed to justify searching the former Navy
official's home in the Pentagon procurement fraud probe.
   U.S. Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell said Paisley's attorneys, but
not Paisley, should be allowed to see the government's papers so
they can provide their client with a ``reasonable defense.''
   Sewell's action in nearby Alexandria, Va., came just hours after
U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt denied Paisley
request to see the affadavit that accompanied a search warrant for
Paisley's office.
   Pratt, who sits in 's lawyers theirthe District of Columbia, told the
lawyers'
their request was merely ``an attempt on your part to find out
information the government has with respect to your client.''
   Search warrants were filed in two different jurisdictions
because Paisley lives in McLean, Va., but has an office in
Washington.
   While Sewell said the attorneys could scrutinize the affidavit,
he agreed with the prosecutors that allowing Paisley a look at the
affidavit could allow him to sabotagng business was legally proper.
   Aronica argued that the government wants to keep search warrant
applications under court seal for a limited period of time because
of concern about the ``possibility of the destruction of records as
well as other forms of possible obstruction'' of the investigation.
   Release of the detailed affidivits, which identify ``subjects
and targets'' of the probe, could hinder the investigation, Aronica
said.
   He noted that ``the government does not have possession of all
the documents we believe are relevant to the investigation,''
Aronica said.
   Aronica argued that ``the only reason we are here is because Mr.
Paisley wants to see what the government has on him.''
   ``If and when Mr. Paisley is indicted by a grand jury, the
federal rules of criminal procedure provide the means of
discovering the evience the government has on him,'' Aronica said.
   Barcella said ``the suggestion that destruction of documents
would take place if it (the affidavit) were given to us has no
basis.''
   Paisley was seeking to inspect the affidavit, not place it in
the public record and Barcella said he was willing to abide by any
court order to keep it secret.
   But Pratt said he was concerned about leaks of confidential
information about the case. Given the breadth of the investigation,
the judge said he couldn't guarantee that the Paisley affidavit
would not be leaked.
   The document ``is extremely detailed, it names a lot of names,''
the judge said.
   The investigation focuses on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Paisley resigned as assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, engineering and systems in 1987 to become a private
consultant for several defense contractors, including McDonnell
Douglas, Martin Marietta, Pratt & Whitney and LTV.
   His office telephone has been tapped for much of the 18-month
investigation. Pratt noted in court that he has been reading weekly
wiretap reports for 45 weeks, though he didn't specify if they were
about Paisley's telephone.
   The McLean, Va., home of Paisley and his fourth wife, Vicki,
also a defense consultant, was also searched by FBI agents.
   Aronica said the detailed affidavits identify ``subjects and
targets of the investigation, evidence the government has and the
government's theory of the case.''
   Expressing concern about leaks from the investigation, Pratt
cited a report in today's editions of The Washington Post about the
release of wiretap transcripts.
   The Post reported that Aronica's boss, U.S. Attorney Henry
Hudson of Alexandria, Va., is trying to track down who leaked
transcripts of wiretapped conversations to NBC news.
   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify, said Hudson
called for the investigation in a letter Wednesday to the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' quoted the wiretap information two nights
this week. Hudson also requested an examination of other leaks that
have plagued the investigation since it became public June 14 when
federal agents searched more than 40 locations nationwide.

<HEAD>Canada Is Against Any Diversion of Great Lakes Water</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Spelling Hnatyshyn is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada firmly closed the door Friday on proposals
to divert water from the Great Lakes into the parched Mississippi
Valley.
   Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn told Parliament that the Canadian
ambassador in Washington, Allan Gotlieb, would deliver a formal
notice to the U.S. State Department saying that Canada is
unalterably opposed to any diversion.
   The United States has no right to divert Great Lakes water and
cannot expect one, he said. ``There is no consent forthcoming.''
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson has proposed diverting water from
Lake Michigan through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal into the
Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, where barge traffic is stalled by
low water levels.
   Although Lake Michigan lies entirely within the United States,
such a diversion would affect water levels in the other Great
Lakes, which are jointly managed by Canada and the United States.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is studying the Illinois
proposal before deciding whether to begin the complex process of
seeking permission from the U.S. Supreme Court to open a lock at
the Chicago canal for the diversion.
   Hnatyshyn said Canada can veto any such proposal as a result of
several treaties. ``We control our resources. We will continue to
control our resources,'' he said.
   Environment Minister Tom McMillan said Thursday that Canada had
been officially informed of the proposal last month and assured of
full consultations. He termed the Illinois plan an ``insane idea''
and noted that other U.S. states bordering the Great Lakes are
against it.
   Opposition parties in Canada have criticized Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's Conservative government for failing to exempt
water under the Free Trade Agreement negotiated with the United
States last year and now undergoing ratification.
   But in a policy statement, the government said it would never
approve large-scale diversions of water south of the border. Canada
has 9 percent of the world's renewable water supplies, but 60
percent of it drains north toward the Arctic. Ninety percent of the
Canadian population lives within 200 miles of the U.S. border.
   To dramatize the point, voluntary water restrictions are in
force in southern Ontario Province where crops are withering in
95-degree heat because of a prolonged dry spell. Heavy rains this
week in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
eased a nine-month drought in that farming region.

<HEAD>Vincennes' Aegis Weapons Are Awesome, But Imperfect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's Aegis weaponry is awesome but
imperfect, according to experts trying to analyze how the 6
million-part, $1 billion system came to target an unarmed Iranian
jetliner.
   Some scrutinizing the tragedy this week in the Persian Gulf say
unleashing the Aegis cruiser Vincennes in the tiny, crowded waters
was the equivalent of letting a pit bull protect a playpen.
   Others say the system, a complex mix of radar, computers and
weapons, did just what it was designed to do: destroyed a presumed
hostile target on an apparent attack course.
   The target, thought to be an Iranian F-14 fighter, was actually
a civilian Airbus with 290 aboard. All were killed in the incident
Sunday.
   Questions have been raised, like why Aegis' super-sophisticated
technology could not separate civilian from military air traffic,
or distinguish a 63-foot-long fighter from a 176-foot airliner.
   The Navy and the key Aegis contractor _ RCA Corp. of Moorestown,
N.J. _ have given only limited answers.
   The technology, at sea only five years, is said to be able to
track some 200 targets from as far as 250 miles. So effective is
the system that crewmen on the first Aegis ship coined the motto,
``If it flies, it dies.''
   But there are problems, say experts, including Aegis' missile
marksmanship, its complex maintenance and its effectiveness in
close quarters.
   ``It is not meant to be sitting in the Potomac next to National
Airport,'' said one congressional staffer.
   The Persian Gulf, with its constant mix of civilian and military
traffic, may be too cramped for the system, said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``The Aegis cruiser is essentially a blue-water ship that was
operating in a brown-water lake,'' said Nunn.
   In theory, experts surmise, the Vincennes' control-room screens
could show civilian routes and even expected flights. The Navy has
not said what flight information the crew had.
   The USS Ticonderoga, the first Aegis cruiser, acted as a ``de
facto'' control tower off Lebanon in 1983, according to its
combat-systems officer. The ship's Aegis systems ``routinely''
sorted out air traffic, Cmdr. James McClure wrote in a 1985 issue
of the naval journal ``Proceedings.''
   Experts say the Vincennes radar consoles likely showed the
Airbus as hostile, since Aegis _ like other anti-air warfare
systems _ has to assume unidentified targets may be enemies.
   Released by Vincennes Capt. Will Rogers III, the emotionless
Aegis let fly SM-2 Standard missiles. One found its mark.
   One Capitol Hill expert insisted Aegis is the world's best naval
system for fighting in cramped quarters. ``It's more suitable
because you can wait longer,'' said the researcher, who asked to
stay anonymous.
   Still, the Vincennes' skipper ``had about four minutes from the
time they picked up this target until it was declared hostile,''
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Sunday.
   That gave Rogers little time to do anything but trust his
computers, analysts said, and decide to protect his crew of some
300 and the billion-dollar ship.
   Pentagon officials say Rogers justifiably concluded the Airbus
was an enemy based on its flight path, its failure to identify
itself, and its confusing broadcast on both civilian and military
frequencies.
   ``They had a lot of indicators, all of which added up to enemy
aircraft,'' said Rep. H. James Saxton, R-N.J., in whose area Aegis
is assembled and tested.
   The information was likely flashed in white symbols on the blue
backgrounds of the four, 42-inch-square ``battle picture'' screens
in the Vincennes' Combat Information Center.
   The screens, providing a dim, unwordly glow in the windowless
chamber, do not show aircraft as traditional radar blips.
   Navy officials have declined this week to let reporters view an
Aegis display. But one expert says the boards designate planes by
showing circles around friends, diamonds around foes and squares
around unknowns.
   In trying to tell friend from foe, the system relies on aircraft
to emit, or ``squawk,'' their identities. Humans, using the system
as a tool, must make the ultimate decisions.
   ``It's not designed to classify targets,'' the congressional
staffer said. ``It's just designed to detect and track them.''
   Ironically, he said, an experienced radar operator using a less
sophisticated system might have been able to tell an Airbus from a
fighter by comparing the size of blips.
   During Aegis first combat deployment, the Ticonderoga's
computers reportedly failed to see a small, incoming plane visible
to the naked eye. In 1986 hostilities off Libya, the Aegis cruiser
Yorktown targeted and shot at what some analysts say was nothing
more than a dense cloud on the water's surface.

   Wat T. Cluverius, a retired State Department Middle
East specialist, has taken over as director-general of the
multinational observer force in the Sinai, the force said Friday.
   Cluverius, 53, assumed the leadership of the Multinational Force

   The group, with headquarters in Rome, monitors compliance with
the military provisions of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
with an observer force in the Sinai.
   Cluverius succeeds Peter D. Constable, another American, upon
completion of his four-year mandate, said MFO spokesman Frank
O'Halloran.
   Cluverius, a Massachusetts native, most recently served in the
State Department as a senior adviser for Middle East peace. A
former ambassador to Bahrain, he also served as a deputy assistant
secretary of state in the bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian
Affairs and, from 1983-85 as consul-general in Jerusalem.
   The director-general is appointed jointly by Egypt and Israel.

<TEXT>
   A Haitian farmworker testified Friday that she lost
her job, cannot support her children and and faces expulsion from
the United States because immigration authorities improperly denied
her a work permit.
   Marie France Jean-Philippe testified in support of a federal
suit accusing the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service of
illegally denying permits to 14,000 predominantly Haitian and
Mexican farmworkers in the Southeast.
   The farmworkers face expulsion from the country if they cannot
obtain Special Agricultural Workers permits required under the new
federal immigration law.
   About 125 Haitians sat quietly in the courtroom Friday listening
to witnesses testify below a mural depicting Florida's history,
including scenes showing field workers and a benevolent judge.
   Ms. Jean-Philippe, 34, testified Friday she arrived in the
United States from Haiti on a boat in 1985 and quickly got a job as
a picker in Homestead.
   ``First I worked in lemons, but I didn't like that _ the thorns
scratched me and, anyway, I'm allergic to them,'' she said through
a Creole interpreter. ``Then I went to the beans. I liked that
better.''
   She was paid $2.50 a bushel, and sometimes made as much as $200
a week, but worked from 5 a.m. to as late as 9 p.m. during the
harvest, she said.
   Ms. Jean-Philippe said that like many crew bosses, hers kept few
records, paying workers in cash at the end of the week. But when
she applied for her work permit with the INS, he supplied
affidavits and what documents he had.
   The INS interviewer at one point made her bend down to show how
she picked beans. But she was denied a permit after the INS called
not the crew boss but the farm owner, who did not know her, she
said.
   Since the permit denial, she has been unable to work to support
herself or her three children still living in Haiti, she said.
   In the suit filed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach
County, the Haitian Refugee Center and several farmworkers says the
INS has failed to respect Congress' wishes.
   The plaintiffs say Congress intended the INS to accept sworn
affidavits as proof that farmworkers met the requirment that they
have worked 90 days in U.S. fields prior to the law's cutoff date.
   But the INS says fraud has been rampant and has insisted on
documentary evidence, which, the plaintiffs say, often does not
exist because crew bosses did not keep records for their illegal
workers.
   The hearing was expected to conclude Monday. Senior U.S.
District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, who is presiding over the case,
said he would not rule immediately.

<TEXT>
   A black softball player on
Friday appealed for help from Canada's prime minister after being
refused a visa to attend an international softball tournament in
Saskatchewan.
   Albert Ramovha was denied a visa because of the international
sports boycott of South Africa.
   Ramovha, 32, said he had been saving money since last year for a
ticket to Canada. The Soweto resident said he hoped ``to witness
softball at its best and learn new techniques to teach my brothers
and sisters back home.''
   Bill Farrell, a diplomat who handles visa matters at the
Canadian Embassy in Pretoria, said Canadian officials advised that
Ramovha could not be issued a visa because of boycott.
   The boycott normally applies to competitors. Ramovha wanted only
to watch the world championship that starts in Saskatoon at the end
of July, but Farrell said officials in Ottawa feared Ramovha might
be viewed as an official representative of the South African
Softball Federation.
   Ramovha, who plays and umpires softball, belongs to the black
federation and serves on a committee of umpires.
   Farrell also said Ramovha had been offered accommodation and
meals by the tournament organizers, thus putting him in a different
category than an ordinary spectator.
   ``He doesn't have to be on the field pitching to be seen as an
official representative of his federation,'' Farrell said.
   Ramovha, who works at a truck rental company near Johannesburg,
said he sent a Telex today to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
appealing for reconsideration of his application.
   Ramovha said he had applied for the visa in February and did not
get a reply until June 30. In the interim, he said, he had borrowed
$1,400 to buy an air ticket, shifted his vacation dates and shopped
for the trip.
   ``I really feel frustrated and destroyed morally,'' Ramovha said
in the message to Mulroney.
   ``Allow me to learn,'' he wrote, appealing for a chance to
``visit your democratic land and learn not only more about softball
but about your way of life.''
   Softball has been played in South Africa since 1946. The
federation to which Ramovha belongs has about 4,000 members,
virtually all of them black. The 3,500-member South African
Softball Association is predominantly white despite being open to
all races.
   The International Softball Federation, which is based in
Oklahoma City and is sponsoring the Saskatoon championship,
suspended South Africa in 1975 as worldwide anti-apartheid pressure
increased. But Ramovha said the federation had encouraged him to
attend the tournament as an individual.
   ``My fellow Sowetans are aware of my intended trip and they are
also eager to learn from me,'' Ramovha said in his Telex. ``They
will be most disappointed to learn I cannot visit Canada.''

   Volunteers from across the lower Rio
Grande Valley flocked here Friday to donate blood, crawl shirtless
through tight spaces and do whatever else they could for victims of
a department store collapse.
   They ignored temperatures in the 90s and the threat of
collapsing rubble to help dig the living and the dead out of the
Amigo Store.
   ``It's such an overwhelming response to the point that we've
been asking people to come back later and relieve the people who
are tired,'' said police Sgt. Ben Reyna said.
   The roof of the popular discount department store crumbled under
torrential rain Thursday afternoon. At least 11 died, 47 were
injured and an unknown number were missing.
   ``I'm just here to help somebody who needs help,'' said Mario
Camarillo, of Brownsville, who inched his way into a crawl space to
help deliver oxygen to survivors trapped in the twisted jungle of
concrete and steel.
   ``You can't turn your back on them. I hope somebody would do
that for me,'' he said.
   Some volunteers crawled deep into the rubble through a path
cleared by a wiry Freddie Gonzalez, 34, who is 4-foot-8.
   ``We kept hearing them crying in there, so we kept digging and
digging. They were all tangled with wire and pieces of wood,'' said
Gonzalez.
   Police were not sure how many people and agencies had responded
to calls for help by noon Friday, but Reyna said the volunteers
came from all over the state and some from across the border Mexico.
   Despite the call for volunteers to work in shifts, many were
ready to stay until the rescue was complete.
   ``I'm not even sleepy,'' said Berta Capatillo, 34, of
Brownsville. ``I just want to get those people out. I think that's
what's keeping me awake. I'm hoping they will be alive.''
   On Thursday, Ms. Capatillo collected information from families
looking for missing relatives or friends. Friday morning, after
staying up all night, she was filling Gatorade bottles with ice and
passing them out to workers, reporters and bystanders.
   Fire engines, huge machinery and portable toilets were set up
within a two-block area leading to the site. A store across the
street from the ruins was converted into a first-aid area, where
survivors were taken and evaluated for medical care.
   Arnold Cadena, of the fire department in Pharr, about 50 miles
away, kept his ladder truck turned on to run generators providing
rescuers with light. The energy also powered an exhaust fan in an
effort to draw heat out of the rubble.
   ``We are like brothers is what it is,'' said Cadena, 28. ``What
it is, is an agreement. If we need help _ any of us _ we're gonna
come out.''

<HEAD>Government Appeals High Court Decision on Interim Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government filed a petition in the
Supreme Court on Friday seeking to overturn another court's
decision to lower the amount of interim relief for victims of the
Bhopal gas disaster.
   The petition challenged an order issued by a panel of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court on April 4 that Union Carbide Corp. be required
to pay $192 million in relief to victims of the 1984 gas leak at a
Carbide subsidiary plant.
   A trial court in Bhopal earlier had set payments at $269 million.
   Union Carbide also has asked the full Madhya Pradesh High Court
to review the interim relief order, contending that any demand for
payments before the overall damage suit is resolved would be unfair.
   India is suing Union Carbide for $3 billion in damages stemming
from the leak of toxic methyl isocyanate gas from a pesticide plant
in Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984. The case is in preliminary hearings in
Bhopal in central India.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and more than 20,000 seriously
injured by the gas. It is considered the world's worst industrial
disaster.
   The petition filed Friday said: ``The High Court failed to
appreciate that in a tragedy of this nature, grant of interim
relief need not be determined with mathematical accuracy.''
   It added: ``If the trial court adopted and arrived at the figure
by applying its judicial mind on the facts of the case, there will
be no justifying ground for interfering with the quantum by the
High Court.''
   The statement also said that ``damages that may be ultimately
decreed are bound to be far in excess of the interim relief granted
by the trial court.''
   No date was set for hearing the petition.

<HEAD>$4 Million Worth of Oyster Beds Open After 20 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials opened thousands of acres of
oyster beds that were closed for 20 years because the
drought-slowed Mississippi River is carrying less sewage and
industrial waste into the Gulf of Mexico.
   The lack of moisture over the Midwest and Plains has left the
Mississippi flowing past New Orleans at about 114,000 cubic feet
per second, about a fourth of its normal flow. Upriver, barges run
aground on newly bared sandbars; downriver, a wedge of saltwater is
edging upstream from the Gulf toward drinking water intakes at New
Orleans and neighboring communities.
   ``The river is very polluted when it's flowing normally,'' said
Jim Cosgrove of the state Department of Health. With the river flow
dropping, it's spewing less pollution into coastal areas where
oysters grow.
   Plaquemines Parish officials estimate that about $4 million
worth of prime oysters soon will be heading to the market from the
areas opened Thursday.
   ``There's always perhaps a silver lining to the big clouds,''
said Ron Dugas of the state Department of State Wildlife &
Fisheries.
   ``It looks real good,'' said oysterman Kenny Fox of Pointe a la
Hache. ``These are quality oysters _ salty and fat and very
productive.''
   Fox has had leases in Cox Bay for 20 years, but pollution had
kept him from harvesting a single oyster.
   Plaquemines Parish officials had been monitoring the areas daily
for about three weeks. Recent samples showed that the counts of
fecal coliform bacteria had dropped from double digit numbers to
almost nothing.
   In another indicator of the river's weakness, biologists from
Louisiana State University say saltwater fish are making their way
up the Mississippi ahead of the leading edge of salty seawater
flowing upstream beneath the lighter river water.
   Without the river's normal flow pushing the saltwater back to
the Gulf, the tip of the wedge of saltwater was at New Orleans,
about 100 miles from the mouth of the river, and saltwater fish
were netted about 35 miles farther upstream.
   Sheepshead and saltwater catfish are among the species reported
caught by fishermen, and LSU researchers say they have caught
menhaden, flounder and Atlantic rays 130 miles from the mouth of
the river.
   Catching saltwater fish in the area of LaPlace is unusual, said
Allen Rutherford of the LSU School of Forestry, Wildlife and
Fisheries.
   Saltwater fish including sail catfish also are being caught by
fishermen in the Atchafalaya River 10 miles upstream from
Sherrington, said Sandy Corkern, LSU marine advisory agent. The
Atchafalaya also empties into the Gulf of Mexico.
   The Army Corps of Engineers said the tip of the saltwater slid
by mile 99 _ three miles past the city's water intake at Algiers _
on Thursday.
   The bulk of the saltwater is 20 miles behind the tip of the
wedge. Salt water hugs the bottom because it is heavier than the
river's fresh water.
   The Corps hopes to slow the salt's advance from the Gulf of
Mexico by constructing a dam of dirt 15 to 25 feet high across the
river bottom near Myrtle Beach, 32 miles downstream from Canal
Street.
   On Thursday, Gov. Buddy Roemer declared a state of emergency for
Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes. All draw
their public water supplies from the river, and are making special
preparations to combat the salt.
   Several industries below New Orleans have begun barging millions
of gallons of water a day to maintain operation.
   Salt concentrations at Chalmette, 10 miles downstream from New
Orleans, reached 129 parts per million Thursday. The federal
standard for safe drinking water is 250 ppm, but that is out of a
concern for corrosion and taste rather than health effects.

   The government on Friday released 394
people, including 59 students, who had been detained as a result of
rioting in Rangoon in March and June, state radio announced.
   With the release of the detainees in Rangoon, Pegu, Prome and
Moulmein, ``all those detained in connection with the March and
June riots in the country have been freed,'' the radio said.
   The latest release brings the total of detainees freed in recent
days to 784, including 288 students, 22 government employees and
474 others.
   The report said that students expelled from various
universities, colleges, schools and instutitions will be readmitted
to their respective educational institutions. All educational
institutions in Burma are state-owned.
   The government closed almost all universities and institutions
of higher learning in the wake of riots in the past few months, and
imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Rangoon.
   The protests, three since October, appear to reflect mounting
opposition to the authoritarian rule of strongman U Ne Win, who
seized power 26 years ago in a military coup.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared a statewide
disaster Friday because of the drought, saying experts had told him
Iowa faces the loss of half of its corn crop, the bedrock of its
economy.
   ``We clearly have a statewide disaster on our hands and a
disaster of national proportions as well,'' Branstad said.
   ``This drought came much quicker and hit much harder than
anything we've had before. This is certainly appropriate action in
light of the severity of the problem.''
   The declaration frees state vehicles for transporting feed and
water, allows use of the National Guard for well drilling or
hauling water, and waives some restrictions on transporting
oversized loads of hay.
   Also, state agencies begin spelling out disaster plans,
including water allocation plans if needed.
   Branstad also asked federal officials to open low-interest loan
programs and other disaster aid for drought-stricken farmers, and
said he hoped to make that case in person to President Reagan next
week.
   ``It is a natural disaster that is beyond the control of any
state,'' he said.
   Iowa joins Indiana, Missouri and Ohio in declaring statewide
emergencies because of the drought.
   ``There is no question the 1988 drought is one of the most
severe Iowa has ever experienced,'' Branstad said.
   Last year, Iowa was the nation's leading corn-producing state,
turning out 1.3 billion bushels valued more than $2 billion.
   The governor's decision came after he met with a task force of
farm experts earlier Friday and was urged by the state's
congressional delegation to take the step during a lobbying trip to
Washington on Thursday.
   ``It looks like the corn crop will be cut in half,'' Branstad
said. ``The best estimate we have at this point in time is that we
will have nearly a 50 percent loss.''
   ``We are the leading corn producing state, it's a very important
crop in this state and a loss of this magnitude is very
significant,'' Branstad said.

   President Reagan has sent messages of
condolences to each of the countries that had citizens aboard the
Iran Air passenger plane that was shot down by a U.S. Navy warship,
the State Department said Friday.
   Deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Reagan asked that his
personal sympathy and condolences and those of the American people
be conveyed directly to the bereaved families.
   The countries receiving the messages were Pakistan, the United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, India, Yugoslavia and Italy, she said.
   On Sunday, shortly afte the plane was shot down, Reagan
apologized to Iran for the incident and said that compensation for
the families is under consideration.

   Freddie Gonzalez, who used his wiry
4-foot-8 frame to save lives Friday by crawling deep into the
dangerous rubble of a collapsed department store, considers himself
just another volunteer.
   Gonzalez, 34, was one of hundreds of people who flocked to the
site of the store. In the humid summer heat of the Rio Grande
Valley, he crawled into the teetering mass of concrete and steel,
all that was left of the Amigo Store.
   ``We went in through a little hole. We kept going in deeper and
deeper and making it bigger and bigger, digging it out with our
hands, and we found the people,'' Gonzalez said. ``We went right up
to them and pulled them out by their legs.
   ``We kept hearing them crying in there, so we kept digging and
digging. They were all tangled with wire and pieces of wood,'' he
said.
   Gonzalez works for Brownsville Equipment and Maintenance, the
company that will probably end up clearing the shattered block.
Shirtless and sweaty, he stayed at the accident scene all night
until 11 a.m. Friday.
   ``It was a little bit hot. The people were running out of
oxygen. That was their major complaint. We ran a little tube
through a small hole. Then we made a bigger hole and put in a
bigger pipe'' to get oxygen to the trapped survivors, he said.
   What if people call him a hero?
   ``No. Everybody did it,'' Gonzalez said.

   Farmers are not authorized to harvest grain
from set-aside and conservation land that has been approved for
haying or livestock grazing, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
said Friday.
   A statement issued by his office said that ``current rumors that
such authorization is imminent are false'' and that ``the
requirement is still in effect that a protective cover be placed on
land out of production'' under the programs.
   The Agriculture Department has authorized farmers in designated
counties _ 1,934 in 37 states as of Friday _ to cut hay or ``green
chop'' the protective cover for use as feed. It cannot be harvested
for grain.

<TEXT>
   Some residents at a school for the
mentally retarded said Friday the state had failed to live up to an
agreement aimed at moving more residents into community-based group
homes.
   A consent decree signed in 1986 sets as a goal 100 community
placements a year from the Southbury Training School. Just 35 were
placed in the year ending June 30, the residents said.
   ``I want to have my own apartment so I can be on my own,'' said
Mirabel Silva, a resident at the school for six years.
   Thomas J. Monroe, who lived at the school 11 years before moving
into a group home and then to his own apartment, said the issue was
one of civil rights.
   He said that almost all the 1,048 people living at Southbury
could make it on their own with the proper support services in the
community.
   The residents ``should be treated as people, not as a vegetable
or a dog on a leash,'' he said.
   ``Some of these people shouldn't be here now,'' he said,
gesturing to those at a news conference in an auditorium at the
institution. But, he said many people ``don't want group homes in
their communities.''
   School Director Steven D. Staugaitis, who spoke on behalf of
state Department of Mental Retardation officials, said the
residents' frustration is understandable. ``They were promised
something and they didn't get it,'' he said.
   He conceded that the state has complied with as much of the
consent decree as it can, but that support services, such as
nursing and therapy, are inadequate in most communities.
   Anne Rotzal, a woman whose son, Alan, has lived at Southbury for
29 years, scoffed at the notion of having virtually everyone move
out of the training school.
   ``Those that can go out, God bless 'em. They should go out,''
she said after listening to the news conference. But, she said,
it's not for everyone.
   Staugaitis said not all residents want to leave. Some have been
there more than 40 years and fear such a change, he said.

<TEXT>
   The National Judicial College, about to
celebrate 25 years of teaching America's judges how to judge, has
courses that cover everything from the ethical dilemmas of medicine
to the proper way to wear that black robe.
   And most of the 22,000 graduates, about one-third of all U.S.
judges, have completed the one to four weeks of classes without
incident.
   But William B. Lawless, a former Notre Dame Law School dean who
now heads the college, can recollect at least one class that was a
bit too realistic. It landed five students _ all judges _ behind
bars.
   ``Oh, it was wonderful; those were experimental times,'' Lawless
said. ``We were trying everything to teach people the judicial
process.''
   The jurists went to a bar and, as part of the scheme, were
propositioned by two young women. A man pretending to be angry
intervened and hit one of the startled judges in the stomach twice.
   All were arrested and jailed, and it was several hours before
they figured out it was an act to introduce them to the other side
of the bench.
   ``A couple of them threatened to sue us for false
imprisonment,'' said Lawless, with a laugh. ``They dropped it,
though. Yes, we have a checkered past.''
   This weekend the school celebrates its 25th anniversary in
ceremonies presided over by Judge Joseph Wapner of television's
``People's Court.''
   The college was founed in 1963 by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Tom
Clark, who saw a void in judicial training. As one former dean
liked to say, ``Law schools train lawyers. They don't train
judges.''
   The college on the University of Nevada-Reno campus has
volunteer rotating instructors from across the U.S. and is funded
by an endowment of more than $6.8 million in state funds, private
donations and American Bar Association money.
   Although the 1,600 who attend the college each year don't face
jail any more, new judges usually begin with an intense four-week
general course affectionately known as ``boot camp.''
   The course explains just about everything from how to put on
your robe and how to conduct yourself in court to actual court
proceedings.
   Other issues covered at the college are ways of keeping court
cases flowing; alcohol, drugs and the courts; how to handle
evidence; how to write an opinion; sentencing guidelines; medical
evidence; search and seizure; jury instructions, and traffic court.
   The college has ongoing courses to update judges on current
issues, like AIDS, surrogacy, bioethics, and conducts seminars
across the country.
   Graduates, who include U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, receive a certificate.
   ``We're still growing,'' said Lawless, who has been dean since
last September. One of the school's goals is to build a mock
courtroom.
   The judges are encouraged to bring their families and often go
to shows and casinos in their spare time. They also take advantage
of the hiking, skiing and boating available in the area.
   ``It was tough but extremely valuable to a new judge because it
touched on most of the issues judges have to deal with,'' said
Alabama Circuit Court Judge Joseph Colquitt of Tuscaloosa.
   Colquitt said the training helped when he decided against a
hospital that was trying to get court permission to amputate a
woman's gangrenous leg, arguing that she would die without the
operation.
   ``The last time I heard she was still walking around,'' the
judge said. ``What I did in that case was rely on what I had
learned about prevailing law in similar cases.
   ``In most jurisdictions you don't come up against the unusual
case. But every once in a while you do. Judges must be prepared and
I think the National Judicial College does that.''

   Some call it total tanning. Others like
``naturalism.'' By any name, nude sunbathing belongs on Florida
beaches, say Tom Chittenden and his friends, who will be out in
force this weekend promoting the idea.
   ``We'll be clothed, but skimpily,'' said Chittenden, founder of
the South Florida Free Beaches Association. ``We'll comply with the
law.''
   Nudism buffs will circulate petitions at John D. MacArthur Beach
State Park, near North Palm Beach, and in Surfside, just north of
Miami Beach, asking that strips of Florida shoreline be designated
as clothing-optional beaches.
   Chittenden said thousands of tourism dollars are lost each year
because nude sunbathers have nowhere to go in the region.
   ``European and Canadian nudists go to the Bahamas or the rest of
the Caribbean,'' he said.
   In 1982, Miami police chased nudists from Virginia Key, which
for 30 years was a favorite location for nude volleyball and total
tanning.
   In 1986, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the state law
prohibiting public nudity.

   Rocky's buddy Bullwinkle is coming to the

   The Wyoming Travel Commission is hoping an advertising campaign
featuring the cartoon character Bullwinkle J. Moose will encourage
people to visit the Rocky Mountain state.
   ``As far as we know, no one else has used Bullwinkle as an
advertising symbol,'' said Rip Repley of the Denver advertising
agency that created the campaign, which will have the rights to
Bullwinkle for two years.
   ``We'll own the moose. The moose will be ours.''
   The ad campaign has a budget of $1.3 million, of which $1
million is set aside for TV spots.
   Bullwinkle and sidekick Rocket J. ``Rocky'' Squirrel were the
stars of a popular cartoon series that began in the early 1960s.

   The colorful mastermind of a North Dakota
seed-potato sale to Honduras that went sour and rocked state
politics pleaded guilty Friday to bribing a former key official in
the state Agriculture Department.
   William Messner, who helped arrange the deal two years ago as
president of a Miami-based trading firm, admitted Friday he gave
the department's former marketing director a $5,000 Caribbean
cruise and as much as $4,000 in cash for business considerations.
   Sentencing was deferred under a plea agreement under which he
can avoid jail and in which he also agreed to pay the state
restitution for expenses.
   Messner boasted the former director, Laurence McMerty, had made
him ``millions of dollars'' by using him as a middleman in the
state's effort to market North Dakota farm commodities in Central
America, according to Deputy Attorney General Bruce Quick.
   ``I think, if we were to sum this case up, is that it involves
the great expectations of most, the good intentions of some, and
the disappointment of all,'' Quick said.
   McMerty, who also faces two bribery charges, has pleaded
innocent and has not been trying to strike a deal with prosecutors,
Quick said. McMerty's trial has been set for Sept. 7. His attorney,
Orell Schmitz, declined comment Friday.
   The case is credited with ruining the political career of
Agriculture Commissioner Kent Jones, a Republican who was denied
endorsement for his third term in office because of the lingering
scandal.
   State officials had initially envisioned selling 4 million
pounds of seed potatoes to a Honduran farm cooperative within a
year after contracts were signed in June 1986.
   But the deal collapsed after Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth
raised questions about its financing, and the state has never been
paid for the only 400,000-pound potato shipment that was actually
delivered.
   McMerty has charged Spaeth and Gov. George Sinner, who are both
Democrats, helped to sabotage the potato deal and were bent on
using it for political gain. Both men, who are running for
re-election this year, deny the charges; Sinner declined comment
Friday.
   Jones became embroiled in the controversy when he and Herbert
Thorndal, former president of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota,
signed a $300,000 note meant to help finance the deal.
   Messner later sold the note to a Miami bank for $264,000,
putting $180,000 of the money in his personal bank account to cover
overdrafts, Quick said.
   Spaeth contends Jones and Thorndal had no authority to issue
either the $300,000 note or a subsequent $1.55 million note, signed
by Thorndal, that was given to Messner and later returned to the
state.
   Quick said Friday there were no grounds to prosecute Jones or
Thorndal.
   Messner was to have gone on trial Tuesday in Grand Forks on two
bribery charges. The felony counts were consolidated into one
charge Friday as part of a plea arrangement.
   Associates of Messner quoted him as calling the state officials
he dealt with a ``bunch of idiots,'' according to investigative
documents made public in the case. The associates said Messner
bragged of having ``the papers to rape, steal and pillage'' after
he set up the potato deal, according to the documents.
   The plea agreement calls for Messner to pay the state $60,888.38
in restitution, which Quick called the state's ``out-of-pocket''
expenses in connection with the sale.
   Messner will not have a felony conviction if he abides by the
agreement and completes three years of supervised probation without
incident, said his attorney, Michael Hoffman.
   Messner, who spent six months in jail after his arrest in
November, will not have to serve additional jail time if he
complies with the plea agreement, Quick said.

<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Shooting down an Iranian airliner was part
of a world plot against Iran and the nation's leaders agree the
best way of foiling it is to confront America, parliament speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday.
   Iranian news reports said three more bodies from the Iran Air
jet _ of a man, woman and child _ were found in the Persian Gulf.
   A U.S. warship shot down the Airbus A300 last Sunday, killing
all 290 people aboard. American officials said officers of the USS
Vincennes thought it was an attacking Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Rafsanjani, who also is Iran's military commander, said: ``An
extensive program has been prepared, in order to save (Iraq), to
deprive the Islamic Republic of its rights.'' Iran and Iraq have
been at war since September 1980.
   He said Iran would not seek revenge for the attack, which
contradicted statements by other Iranian leaders.
   ``The United States is trying to push us to commit the same
crime ... but if we did that, the world would turn against us,''
Rafsanjani told tens of thousands at a weekly prayer service.
``That is why we do not push to take revenge. Wise people
understand why we do not take revenge.''
   Prayer services on the Moslem sabbath often are forums for
important political speaches.
   Rafsanjani said the United States was emphasizing different
reactions among the Iranian leadership in an attempt to portray it
as divided.
   ``In Iran, all the officials are agreed on the fact that we
should confront America, and all our officials and people believe
that we should continue on our path until we achieve our rights,''
he said.
   Iran has said often it will continue the war until it achieves
its ``rights,'' a fluctuating body of demands centered on the world
branding Iraq the aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980
after several border skirmishes.
   Before Rafsanjani spoke, the newly formed General Command issued
a statement exhorting ``all persons who can carry a gun'' to report
for war duty.
   Western diplomats said the remarks by Rafsanjani, considered
second in power to revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, indicate Tehran may have decided on a restrained response
to the loss of the airliner.
   As is common during prayer services in Iran, the crowd chanted
``Death to America!'' and ``War, War Until Victory!'' In the
audience were young ``basij,'' or volunteers, in red headbands; a
few wounded war veterans, and Iraqi prisoners of war.
   Brig. Gen Mansour Satari, the U.S.-trained chief of the Iranian
air force, said late Thursday that the U.S. Navy must have been
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the
Airbus and its Iranian control tower.
   Satari told foreign reporters the shooting was ``intentional and
unprovoked,'' but qualified that later by saying the U.S. military
``accepted on purpose'' the risk of attacking civilian planes
because it could not control its sophisticated systems.
   ``The radar contact was a big, wide-bodied airliner and totally
different from a fighter-bomber,'' Satari said. ``The climbing, the
maneuverability of an airliner is totally different, so a radar man
is able to tell the difference.'' Speaking fluent English with an
American accent, Sartari said he had been a ``radar man'' earlier
in his career.
   He said Iran had ``all the tapes needed'' to prove normal
conversation was going on from the time the jet's engines were
started on the ground until the attack. It was shot down with
missiles a few minutes into a short flight from a military-civilian
airport at Bandar Abbas to Dubai across the Strait of Hormuz.
   The plane was traveling in ``the center of the international air
corridor'' between those cities and could have deviated 10 miles on
either side and still be in the corridor, he said.
   Mohammad Reza Majidi, manager of Iran Air, said in a statement
fewer than 200 bodies had been recovered out of the 290 people on
board, and only 150 identified. He said the ``black box'' data
recorder had not been found.

<HEAD>CBS Sets Fall Schedule Due to Writers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS announced a fall schedule including
miniseries, original movies, and specials Friday despite the
writers' strike.
   Kim LeMasters, the network's entertainment division president,
said CBS is concerned about the strike and its impact, but added,
``We are nonetheless ready and able to program strong original
product for the fall season.''
   NBC and ABC have announced parts of interim plans to fill the
prime-time schedule in spite of the shutdown of motion picture and
television production caused by the 18-week Writers Guild of
America strike. CBS had said earlier the debut of its fall schedule
would be delayed by the walkout.
   LeMasters said CBS had a number of animated, entertainment and
news specials, and sports events for airing.
   ``The Cavanaughs,'' starring Barnard Hughes and Christine
Ebersole, will return on CBS with original episodes Aug. 8 and
continue into October. ``First Impressions,'' starring Brad
Garrett, Thom Sharp and James Noble, will debut Aug. 27 and run
through October.
   In addition, three original episodes of ``Murder, She Wrote''
will be presented.
   LeMasters said CBS had more than 30 made-for-TV movies and it
would telecast films Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays. The network
also has a number of major theatrical films, such as ``Out of
Africa,'' ``Agnes of God'' and ``Cocoon.''
   Twelve hours of miniseries are available for the fall:
``Internal Affairs,'' starring Richard Crenna and Kate Capshaw;
``Dadah Is Death,'' starring Julie Christie; and ``Jack the
Ripper,'' starring Michael Caine, Armand Assante and Jane Seymour.
   CBS also has its first animated miniseries, ``This is America,
Charlie Brown.'' The first two hours will be telecast in the fall,
with the second two hours to come later.

   For the first time in more than four years,
Massachusetts in June failed to have the lowest unemployment rate
among the nation's 11 most populous states, so Democratic Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis is losing a standard line in his presidential
campaign speeches.
   The government reported Friday that while the nation's civilian
jobless rate dropped 0.3 percentage point to a 14-year low 5.3
percent last month, unemployment in Dukakis' home state climbed to
3.5 percent from 2.8 percent in May.
   It was the first time since February 1984 _ before the collapse
of world oil prices _ that Massachusetts has not had the lowest
jobless rate of the 11 most populous states, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Texas then had the lowest rate, 5.6 percent, compared with 5.7
percent for Massachusetts.
   Last month, New York matched Massachusetts' 3.5 percent jobless
rate and North Carolina dropped below it, to 3.2 percent from 3.5
percent in May.
   Massachusetts officials attributed the June increase in the
state's unemployment to a flow of out-of-school teen-agers coming
into the labor market.
   Private analysts, while cautioning not to put too much store in
one month's figures, said it is the inevitable reaction to the
economic boom that Massachusetts has had over the past five years
and that Dukakis has been touting in his presidential campaign.
   ``Growth in Massachusetts has slowed down, there's no doubt
about that,'' said Roger Brinner, a labor market specialist for
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   ``But not even the most ardent Republican would try to claim
that the Massachusetts miracle has become the Massachusetts
debacle,'' he said. ``If it holds at 3.5 percent or rises to 4
percent over the next several months, it will be shoved under
Dukakis' nose. But one month's figure is not enough.''
   Marlene Seltzer, director of the Massachusetts Division of
Employment Security, said 70 percent of the 112,000 people
unemployed in the state last month had been jobless for less than a
month, indicating many of them were new entrants in the labor
market.
   By comparison, only 47 percent of the nation's unemployed had
been jobless for less than a month, indicating a much smaller share
of people seeking jobs for the first time and unable to find them
in June.
   Larry Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., economic forecasting firm, said it is impossible to draw any
conclusions about Massachusetts' economy from one month's
employment numbers.
   ``The monthly state-by-state rates are so unreliable because of
the small samples they are based on that I would not believe there
was a fundamental change occurring until I saw it continue for
several months,'' he said.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association
of Manufacturers, said he has seen no evidence of slackening demand
for workers in the state.
   ``Dukakis is really having some poor luck recently,'' Jasinowski
said of the figures. ``I'm getting reports that labor shortage
problems are greater in Massachusetts than any other state in the
country.''

   Fifteen guards were beaten Friday in a
planned attack by inmates at the maximum-security Trenton State
Prison, officials said.
   Corrections spokesman James Stabile said 14 prisoners were
charged in the beatings. The prison was closed to visitors, he
said, and inmates were locked in their cells following the
disturbance.
   Stabile said no prisoners were injured.
   He said the melee broke out in the mess hall about 7:15 a.m.
when an inmate struck a corrections officer from behind. An
undetermined number of prisoners joined in, punching and beating
other guards, Stabile said.
   There were 300 prisoners in the mess hall, he said.
   About 10 minutes later, inmates in another wing of the prison
surrounded and attacked guards, he said.
   By 8:30 a.m., other guards had restored order. Stabile said the
lockdown will continue until an internal investigation is completed.
   The injured officers were treated at St. Francis Medical Center
for broken bones, lacerations, possible concussions and puncture
wounds. All the guards were later released, he said.
   ``They had been beaten pretty badly,'' Stabile said. He said the
attacking prisoners ``went for the head.''
   ``Officers were down and guys were pummeling them,'' Stabile
said.
   No weapons were found, he said.
   Stabile said officials had not determined a motive, but that it
appeared some prisoners planned the attack and others joined
spontaneously.
   Fourteen inmates were charged with disciplinary violations. If
convicted, they face up to a year's loss in commutation time, 364
days in lockup with only limited privileges and 15 days in solitary
confinement.
   Stabile said corrections officials also will seek criminal
charges.

   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk said Friday
that Vice President George Bush may have used tax money on campaign
trips, and he questioned whether Bush can make any more trips in
the next month without violating federal spending limits.
   Bush denied Kirk's allegation, calling it ``an outrageous
charge.''
   ``We are not abusing the public trust,'' Bush said in Atlanta,
arriving for a fund-raising event several hours after Kirk's
remarks.
   ``We've bent over backwards to be within the letter, certainly
the spirit of the law,'' Bush said to reporters traveling on Air
Force Two with him from Washington. Friday's trip was political and
financed as such, aides said.
   Kirk made his statements at a news conference in Atlanta and in
a letter delivered to President Reagan's counsel, A.B. Culvahouse,
asking for ``immediate attention.''
   He also said the party may complain to the Federal Election
Commission.
   ``The only thing that matches the hypocrisy of the Republican
Party of the 1980s claiming to be the party of fiscal conservatism
is the Republican Party of the 1980s preaching about law and
order,'' Kirk told reporters.
   He said Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, may
have violated the law by using vice presidential funds for campaign
trips to Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio.
   Even if the Bush campaign pays for the trips, Kirk said, it may
be exceeding the limit for campaign expenses in the pre-convention
period.
   Kirk said Bush should disclose how he intends to pay for any
further campaign travel before the Republican National Convention
in August and whether he intends to borrow against the money
allocated for the post-convention campaign.
   Reminded that 1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale exceeded his pre-convention spending limit, Kirk said, ``In
1984, we learned a lesson. We'd like for both parties to come to
this issue with clean hands.''
   Kirk's news conference was held in the same hotel as a
Republican ``Unity '88'' meeting that the vice president was to
address later Friday. Bush representatives attended Kirk's news
conference to distribute copies of a response from Bush campaign
manager Lee Atwater.
   Atwater said the Louisville and Columbus trips were paid for by
the Bush campaign.
   ``Mr. Kirk is wrong on the facts, and I challenge him to come
forward with something more than political innuendo if he wants to
level accusations against this campaign,'' Atwater's statement said.
   Kirk's statements ``are totally without merit and are obviously
designed to distract public attention from the real issues of the
last two weeks _ Mike Dukakis' compulsion to raise taxes and his
reckless prison furlough program which has released first-degree
murderers and rapists onto the streets of America where they can
continue their reigns of terror,'' Atwater said.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan
administration is ``scrupulously careful in determining who pays
for political activities. This sounds like more political hot air
to me.''

   Partial results from Mexico's presidential
election show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party winning,
but with the lowest margin in its six decades of rule, sources said
Friday.
   The figures from the Federal Electoral Commission, which a
reliable source gave The Associated Press, show presidential
candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari ahead with 47.4 percent of the
popular vote.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist coalition National Democratic
Front was second with 26.7 percent, and Manuel J. Clouthier of the
conservative National Action Party third with 20.7 percent.
   The count is for 11.7 million of the 38 million registered
voters, or 30.7 percent.
   In addition to the presidency, 64 Senate seats and 500 in the
newly expanded Chamber of Deputies also are at stake.
   The Federal Electoral Commission, which controls the vote count,
released fragmentary, unofficial results early Thursday, one day
after the nationwide elections. It said final results were not
expected until Sunday.
   The leak of a vote count appeared to be made to deflect growing
speculation that the ruling party, known as the PRI, had suffered a
devastating loss.
   No presidential candidate since the PRI's inception in 1929 has
won with less than 70 percent of the vote.
   The slow vote count also is making evident splits within the
party between the 40-year-old Salinas de Gortari and his closest
associates, known as technocrats, and the old-style politicians.
   The Federal Electoral Commission is headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Bartlett, who was one of Salinas de Gortari's chief rivals
for the PRI's presidential nomination.
   Salinas de Gortari has insisted throughout the campaign that a
new era of modern Mexico will be recognized in which opposition
voices will be heard.
   In issuing his proclamation of victory Thursday, Salinas de
Gortari said: ``It is the new political reality of the nation, and
with which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful
fashion.''
   The commission has warned candidates against claiming victory
before the final tally is in.
   ``No official preliminary results have been issued on the
presidential election. Consequently, claims by candidates and
parties are not based on any official information,'' the commission
said in a brief statement Thursday night.
   Bartlett first said technical difficulties with a new computer
system delayed the returns. He later blamed bad weather.
   The government says the elections were peaceful and clean. PRI
officials have said charges by opposition parties that the
balloting was fraudulent was simply a publicity-seeking move.
   ``The Mexican political system is corrupt and lacks
credibility,'' Clouthier said in announcing a protest march
Saturday afternoon in downtown Mexico City.
   ``As sure as I am that I did not win the presidency, I can
affirm the electoral process was not clean,'' Gumersindo Magana,
candidate of the small, conservative Mexican Democratic Party, was
quoted as saying Friday by the government newspaper El Nacional.
   Political analyst Jorge Castaneda said Cardenas, who split away
from the PRI and ran as the candidate of the leftist coalition
National Democratic Front, apparently did well in urban areas.
   The question is ``whether the votes that come in from the
countryside will be enough to compensate for the Cardenas lead in
urban Mexico,'' Castaneda said.
   He defined urban as any town of at least 5,000 people,
accounting for two-thirds of the 38 million registered voters.
   Cardenas, Clouthier and presidential candidate Rosario Ibarra de
Piedra of the tiny, radical Revolutionary Workers Party met with
federal officials Wednesday night and issued a statement accusing
the government of massive fraud.
   Magana did not sign the statement but also accused the
government of fraud.
   The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a civic watchdog group,
recorded 1,100 cases of voting irregularities ranging from
ballot-stuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls.
   Fourteen complaints were filed with the attorney general's
office, including falsification of electoral documents to the
disappearance of 11,000 ballots in Mexico City's 27th Electoral
District and thousands more in western Michoacan state.
   The PRI has controlled the presidency, congress and
gubernatorial offices in all of Mexico's 31 states since its
founding in 1929.
   While claiming victory, Salinas de Gortari called the campaign
``one of the most contested elections in our history and one of the
most peaceful.''
   He seemed to be preparing the party for what could be a pivotal
moment in PRI history _ less than overwhelming victory at all
levels.
   ``The era of practically one party ends and we enter now in a
new political stage in the life of the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes in Afghan City, 31 Reported Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A truck packed with explosives
exploded Friday in a crowded business section of the Afghan city of
Jalalabad, killing 31 people and damaging cars and buildings, the
state-run Kabul radio reported.
   It was the third car bomb attack in an Afghan city in as many
days.
   The radio, quoting Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency,
said the blast also destroyed 25 vehicles parked in a nearby
parking lot and damaged a local theater and 45 shops.
   Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, blamed ``criminal extremist
opposition'' for the explosion, apparently referring to Afghan
guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet government. It called the attack
an ``unforgiveable crime.''
   The radio did not mention injuries. The official Soviet news
agency Tass reported 33 injured, most of them women, children and
elderly people.
   Kabul radio said the latest deaths brought to 38 the number of
people killed in the three car bomb explosions.
   On Wednesday, six people died when a car bomb blew up in Kabul,
the Afghan capital, the radio said. Western diplomats reported four
dead.
   A second car bomb exploded in the capital Thursday, killing one
person, the radio said.
   No group has claimed responsibility for any of the explosions.
   Jalalabad, about 70 miles east of Kabul, has been the scene of
heavy fighting during the Afghan civil war. The Soviet Union began
its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on May 15 and Jalalabad was
the first city to be emptied of Red Army soldiers.
   The Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in December
1979 to back the Marxist government. Last April, the Soviets agreed
to a U.N.-sponsored agreement that commits them to pull the
estimated 115,000 troops they deployed in the country.
   Afghan guerrilla leaders have said previously they would not
target residential areas in their eight-year war against the
government because the civilian death toll would be too high.
   Tass also reported Friday that guerrillas had shelled
Rude-Ahmadzai in Paktia province along the Pakistani border. It
said one person was killed and several houses destroyed when a
shell touched off a fire.
   The Soviets have accused Pakistan of violating the Geneva
accords on Afghanistan by allowing guerrillas based on its
territory to ship weapons, ammunition and supplies into Afghanistan.

   The complex Aegis air defense system, used by
the cruiser Vincennes last week to shoot down an Iranian passenger
jet, was never thoroughly tested before the Navy began deploying
it, according to a classified General Accounting Office report.
   The report, as described by congressional sources, found that
the ability of the Aegis to discriminate among various targets was
never adequately proven.
   The report was begun long before last Sunday's incident, in
which the Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655, thinking it was
an Iranian F-14 fighter jet. All 290 people aboard the commercial
plane were lost.
   Pentagon officials are reviewing information that led the
Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, to have his ship fire
missiles at the plane in the Strait of Hormuz. They have said the
Aegis system aboard the Vincennes was not malfunctioning.
   In an interview with the Portland Oregonian, Rep. Denny Smith,
R-Ore., who was an outspoken critic of the Aegis system when it was
being debated in Congress in 1983, criticized former Navy Secretary
John Lehman for moving too quickly on the Aegis.
   Smith said Lehman and Adm. James Watkins, former chief of naval
operations, ``oversold this program to themselves, to the Navy and
to the public. This is a public relations coup, not a technological
coup.''
   Smith disputed the Navy's claim that the $500 million Aegis
system was built to detect and follow 200 or more targets at a time.
   ``If they had trouble with one airliner, what would they do with
a half-dozen high-speed fighters on the deck?'' he said.
   He said the Navy was guilty of ``a damn the torpedoes, full
speed ahead, get the hulls in the water, we'll fix it later kind of
attitude.''
   Aegis, named after the mythic shield of the Greek god Zeus, is a
complex mix of radars and computers. It was developed as the main
component of protection for Navy surface ships against enemy ships
and planes.
   The Navy is building a fleet of Aegis-class cruisers, of which
the Vincennes is the third. The service is also some components of
the Aegis system aboard other surface ships. The system was first
deployed in 1983.
   The GAO review, started last year, looked at the Aegis testing
program before the system went into service, said the congressionl
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The congressional watchdog agency criticized a series of 1984
tests in which the Aegis system tracked 11 targets and guided the
firing of weapons which hit 10, the sources said. At one point, two
targets were fired at the same time.
   ``The tests didn't conclusively show that Aegis can distinguish
among potential targets,'' said one source.
   The 1984 test program was set up specifically to answer
complaints from Aegis critics who argued that the system needed
more realistic tests.
   The tests were set up so carefully they did not approximate a
``real-life'' combat environment, the sources quoted the GAO report
as saying.
   Navy officials did not return a telephone call seeking comment
on the GAO study, first reported upon this week by The Washington
Post and the Seattle Times.
   But service officials in the past have disputed similar
criticisms by the GAO and have argued the Aegis tests were
realistic and showed the system worked as advertised.

   The legal cases against people who took part in
ethnic riots in the Azerbaijan republic were moved Friday to courts
in the Russian federation, as Armenians had demanding for months.
   Armenians say courts in Azerbaijan would be too lenient because
of ethnic bias.
   The Soviet Supreme Court and the prosecutor's office ordered the
transfer.
   Courts have been investigating riots Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani
port of Sumgait in whch 32 people were killed, 26 of them ethnic
Armenians. Most of the suspects are believed to Azerbaijanis, who
differ in culture and religion from Armenians.
   Most Armenians are Christian and Azerbaijanis are predominantly
Moslem.
   Soviet officials have said more than 80 people have been charged
in the unrest in the Caucasus, in which six Azerbajanis have been
killed and 200 people have been injured.
   Pending cases involve premeditated murder, robberies and ``mass
disorders,'' according to the Friday announcement by the high court
and prosecutor's office.
   The announcement, read during the national evening television
news program Vremya, did not say why the cases were being
transferred, but Moscow officials may feel Russian courts would be
less prejudiced.
   Azerbaijan's Supreme Court on May 16 convicted an Azerbajiani
metalworker of murder in the rioting and sentenced him to the
maximum 15 years in prison.
   The riots sprang from a dispute over control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian mountain enclave in
Azerbaijan. Armenians demand that the area be made part of their
southern republic.
   The dispute has also led to strikes and street rallies. The
latest round of strikes in Armenia began Monday, apparently
prompted by dissatisfaction with a national Communist Party
conference that failed to resolve the dispute.
   Soviet newspapers reported Friday that some Armenians have
returned to work after a general strike that has paralyzed Yerevan,
the capital of Armenia, but that a walkout persists in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenia's Parliament has endorsed the annexation demand, but
Azerbaijan has balked. Armenia asked Moscow to intervene.
   On Monday and Tuesday, demonstrators stormed Yerevan's airport,
and one was killed by a plastic bullet fired by Soviet troops.
   The disturbances disrupted 65 flights, the newspaper
Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported. It said $16 million a day
was being lost in industrial production.
   The labor newspaper Trud said a strike in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, had cost $64 million in lost
industrial production and that factories elsewhere in the Soviet
Union were suffering because Stepanakert enterprises failed to
deliver $32 million worth of supplies.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the Stepanakert strike
continued Friday.
   But some workers were back at their jobs in Yerevan. A broadcast
journalist, speaking from Yerevan by telephone on condition of
anonymity, said about half of the city's public transport began
running Friday. Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya said food-producing
enterprises were operating.

   Nancy Reagan has tapped one of the nation's
premier ghostwriters, Bill Novak, to help her write her memoirs,
the White House revealed on Friday.
   Novak has helped several personalities create best-selling books
about their lives. His credits include ``Iacocca,'' the
autobiography of Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca; ``Man of the
House,'' the political memoirs of former House Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill, and ``The Mayflower Madam,'' the story of Sydney
Biddle Barrows, who detailed her life running a high-class
prostitution service.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has regularly kept a diary of her White House
days, will meet with Novak ``on a regular basis'' in order to
produce the book by the fall of 1989, said Elaine Crispen, Mrs.
Reagan's spokeswoman.
   The first lady has indicated that she might use her memoirs to
settle a few scores.
   The White House was embarrassed earlier this year when President
Reagan's former chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, used his book
``For the Record,'' to reveal that the first lady relied on an
astrologer to help formulate the president's schedule. Regan also
contended that Mrs. Reagan formed a cabal to force him from office
at the height of the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Although the first lady has staunchly refused to discuss the
issue of stargazing, she told reporters during the Moscow summit
that she intended to deal with it ``my way,'' in her own book.
   And, Mrs. Reagan contended, the former chief of staff will
``absolutely'' be interested in her version of the story.
   The first lady traveled to New York this week to make the
arrangements with her publisher, Random House, Mrs. Crispen said.
   Mrs. Reagan reached an agreement with the publisher in 1986 to
write the story of her personal life and her marriage to the
president, but no announcement has been made about an advance made
to the first lady, Mrs. Crispen said.

   Lifeguards tried a new way of protecting
swimmers Friday: keeping them off beaches altogether as medical
waste once again washed ashore.
   With temperatures in the 90s, Jones Beach and Robert Moses State
Park beach were closed because officials decided a ban on swimming
would be insufficient to ensure no one was hurt by the debris.
   The only people on the beach were cleanup crews searching for
additional garbage floating ashore _ bad news for the state and
concessionaires, who say the weekend after July 4 is traditionally
summer's biggest. A crowd of more than 100,000 would normally be
expected at the state beaches.
   ``It's really a creepy feeling sifting through this stuff,''
said Sharon Moynahan, 18, who assisted in the cleanup. ``I'm trying
to be really careful. I don't want to catch anything.''
   Ron Foley, Long Island regional director for state parks, said
no decision on reopening the beaches would be made until Saturday.
Officials wanted to see what the next tide brings.
   Jones Beach was reopened 4 p.m. Friday _ more of a token gesture
than anything else, as it was set to close at 7:30 p.m. and did not
mean beaches would be open Saturday, officials said.
   The assortment of syringes, bandages and blood vials could have
entered the ocean through the sewer system, either when washed off
a street or dumped into a sewer, said Environmental Protection
Agency spokesman Richard Cahill.
   ``We don't believe this is the result of illegally dumped
hospital waste,'' said Randy Braun, an EPA worker who examined the
ocean water by helicopter.
   James Marshall, another EPA spokesman, said debris collected
Thursday and Friday included fewer than three dozen syringes. Also
found were three blood vials, and numerous vials associated with
crack use, he said.
   Mixed in with the medical waste has been garbage consistent with
beach usage, littering and sewage overflow, he said.
   Although hospitals everywhere have to deal with the problem,
federal environmental officials say these kinds of incidents appear
to be confined to New York and New Jersey.
   ``We haven't found anything like this anywhere else,'' said J.
Winston Porter, the federal Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for solid waste.
   The garbage recovered from the beaches will be turned over to
the office of U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney to determine if it
can be traced and whether criminal charges are called for, said
U.S. Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.

   President Reagan plans to nominate a former
federal prosecutor from Buffalo, N.Y., as assistant secretary of
the treasury for enforcement, the White House announced Friday.
   The announcement said Salvatore R. Martoche would be nominated
to succeed Francis Anthony Keating II, who has been nominated to be
associate attorney general, the third-ranking official in the
justice Department.
   Martoche, 47, was U.S. attorney for the Western District of New
York from 1982 to 1986. He has since been assistant secretary of
labor for enforcement.

   Astronaut Charles Bolden twice rode
a safety basket at 50 mph down a 1,200-foot ``slide for life'' wire
Friday to practice an emergency launch pad escape from the space
shuttle Discovery.
   Two safety workers rode with him on the second trip.
   It was the first time humans had ridden the basket escape system
since it was installed several years ago for the shuttle program.
Astronauts and pad personnel would use the system in case of a
fire, fuel or gas leak or other emergency on the pad that gave them
time to reach the baskets.
   After a simulated emergency was declared, Bolden, a veteran of
one shuttle mission, made his way from the cabin level of Discovery
_ 195 feet up Launch Pad 39B _ and climbed into the basket for the
dizzying descent.
   The basket's fast fall was arrested abruptly at the bottom by a
braking system made up of a series of increasing-density steel
chains that dragged through the sand in the landing zone.
   Had the brakes failed, the basket would have been jolted to a
stop by a net stretched across the basket's path.
   Once at the bottom, Bolden leaped from the basket and ran to the
safety of a nearby concrete-lined underground bunker.
   He reported the ride was smooth and then returned to the
spacecraft cabin level and repeated the ride with two pad safety
personnel, George Hoggard and Albert Bumgardner. Each of the seven
baskets is rated to hold three people.
   NASA reported both tests were completed successfully.
   Previous basket tests were run with sandbags and dummies for
ballast, and two sandbag tests preceded Bolden's first run Friday.
   Until recently, some NASA officials felt the swift ride would be
risky and should be tried only in an actual emergency.
   But with the added emphasis on safety following the loss of
shuttle Challenger and its seven crew members, the space agency
decided recently to man-rate the basket system after making several
improvements.
   Bolden, Hoggard and Bumgardner volunteered for the job.
   Among the improvements were the addition of two baskets,
increasing the number to seven; the cutting of a side exit in each
basket to ease entry and exit; adding a flame protective covering
over the existing webbed material, and the installation of an
anti-rollback brake to ensure the basket stopped as quickly as
possible.
   Discovery was moved to the launch pad Monday to be prepared for
the first shuttle launching since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986. The launch is scheduled in early September.
   Bolden flew as pilot on the shuttle mission before the
Challenger accident. He has been named to pilot another flight next
year.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Sept. 20 Trial Date For North</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with more details, editing changes.</NOTE>

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case Friday
ordered Oliver L. North to stand trial Sept. 20 and gave the fired
White House aide access to a wide range of secret documents to show
he acted with higher authority.
   The order by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell means that
the first criminal trial resulting from the Iran-Contra affair is
scheduled to be under way when the fall presidential campaign is in
full swing.
   But Gesell's ruling on secret documents also pointedly raised
the possibility that three major charges stemming from the
diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels
would not be part of the case when it goes to trial _ if ever.
   Gesell's order said that the defense had shown during a closed
hearing on Wednesday that highly sensitive passages of documents
that government security experts want deleted from the
prosecution's case ``tended to exonerate North of guilt on certain
charges.''
   The documents and others are relevant to the major charges
against North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord, the judge said.
   Gesell directed independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to produce
any documents to support North's claims that money raised by Hakim
and Secord from the arms deals was combined with government money
``to plan and carry out various covert operations, including
actions directly or indirectly supporting the Contras.''
   The judge ordered Walsh to turn over documents that corroborate
North's claim that these activities ``were all approved at or near
Cabinet level; their execution was closely monitored through the
use of a variety of intelligence methods and sources.''
   The documents should include those that show ``funding of the
activity from any source'' and ``whether or not senior government
officials were aware of the activity,'' Gesell said.
   Gesell said he was not ruling on the merits of North's defense
or the admissibility of any documents as evidence.
   ``The jury must decide where the truth lies,'' Gesell said. But
the judge said he was ordering the government to produce the highly
secret documents ``to assure that the truth, whatever it ultimately
proves to be, `will out.'''
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), the
government could decide it does not want to prosecute North on the
major conspiracy charge because doing so would require disclosure
of sensitive information that would jeopardize national security.
   If the problems of disclosing secret government documents cannot
be resolved by September, Gesell said he will proceed to try North
on charges that don't require extensive use of classified material.
   ``At a minimum, substantive charges of cover-up, falsification
and North's alleged receipt of personal benefit derived from his
conduct as a government employee can proceed to trial,'' Gesell
said.
   ``This trial date is six months after indictment. It must be
met.''
   In a brief statement, Walsh said: ``We are ready to proceed as
directed by the court.''
   The charge that North conspired with his three co-defendants to
defraud the government by illegally diverting arms-sale proceeds
requires the most use of classified documents.
   This charge, plus two others charging all four defendants with
wire fraud and theft of government property, involve questions of
whether the defendants intended to violate the law.
   Among the secret materials sought by North, Gesell noted, ``are
documents bearing primarily on issues of criminal intent, which is
of particular significance to the first three counts of the
indictment.''
   ``They may also support defense challenges to the credibility of
certain known prosecution witnesses who have, in the past, denied
that North's funding and other activities were monitored, known and
approved at the highest levels of government.''
   An expected defense to the three charges is that North and his
co-defendants acted with the implicit or explicit approval of
higher officials in the Reagan administration. Gesell has ordered
separate trials for all four defendants.
   North should be given documents containing any references to
covert aid to the Contras in President Reagan's daily intelligence
briefings between Sept. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986, or in the
president's regular daily briefing by his staff, Gesell said.
   Any other information about aid to the Contras that was
forwarded to the White House by the Central American Joint
Intelligence Task Force during this period should also be provided,
the judge said.
   The judge also ordered Walsh to specify by Aug. 1 the documents
he intends to produce as evidence against North on the other 13
charges against the former White House aide.
   These include charges that North lied to Congress about his role
in providing covert aid to the Contras and that he shredded
documents during Attorney General Edwin Meese III's November 1986
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   He is also charged with accepting an illegal gratuity _ a
$15,000 security fence installed around his suburban Virginia home.
The indictment charges that Secord paid for the fence.
   North is accused of obstructing an FBI investigation into the
fence as well as pocketing $4,300 worth of travelers checks from
the $90,000 he was given by Contra leaders to defray expenses of
helping the rebels.
   ``A jury trial on those counts remaining after the CIPA process
takes its course is set for Sept. 20,'' Gesell said.
   The classified information law has provisions for substituting
secret documents with statements of facts about what the material
would prove or by redacting, or deleting, especially sensitive
portions of classified material.
   Gesell noted that a government task force studying documents
Walsh intends to produce in his case against North ``remains
adamantly opposed to any public disclosure of the classified
information redacted'' by prosecutors from the material.
   This includes passages that ``tended to exonerate North of guilt
on certain charges,'' the judge said.
   At Wednesday's hearing, which was not attended by prosecutors,
North's lawyer ``also demonstrated how his theory of the defense
requires use of redacted portions of the government's case.''
   The judge said he had concluded that the prosecution ``has
redacted certain information from its documentary case-in-chief
which must be available to North for his use in trial.''
   The judge said North is entitled to obtain documents showing he
participated under a pseudonym in covert activities and ``any use
of contemplated use of the vessel Erria.''
   The Danish freighter was used in clandestine arms shipments from
Europe to the Contras. In 1986 it carried arms to the Mediterranean
as part of an anticipated arms-for-hostage deal that never occurred.

   A Palestinian teen-ager concealing two knives
under a flowing robe stabbed four Israeli guards Friday in a Gaza
Strip prison where he was pretending to visit his brother.
   The army ordered 10 Palestinians deported from the occupied
lands in apparent retaliation for the attack, which a prison
spokesman said was linked to an underground Islamic fundamentalist
group.
   One Palestinian was killed in a clash with army troops in the
West Bank.
   In a statement, the army said the deportees played ``a central
role in planning and carrying out'' anti-Israeli actions in the
territories in recent months.
   After Friday's stabbing in Gaza City's Central Prison, troops
chased the 17-year-old assailant and arrested him, said prison
spokesman Johnny Tester.
   Arab reports identified the youth as Yassir Mahmoud Al Khawajah,
a butcher from the Gaza Strip town of Rafah.
   Tester said the teen-ager was a member of fundamentalist group
that the army believes planned the attack.
   Two jailers were in serious condition, one with knife wounds to
the chest and head, and the other with stab wounds to the chest,
Tester said. A third guard had moderate wounds to the chest and the
fourth was slightly wounded in the face.
   Tester said the teen-ager, dressed in a traditional Arab robe,
approached the jailers during visiting hours, then pulled out the
knives and attacked them.
   The youth pretended he wanted to visit his jailed brother but
``he really came for the sake of attacking, not to visit anybody,''
Tester told The Associated Press.
   One of the wounded guards, Amiram Ravivo, told Israel radio he
was writing down the names of Palestinian visitors when the
assailant attacked.
   ``Just as I raised my head I saw someone coming at me with a
knife. I managed to grab his hand, then I tried to get up and he
slashed my face,'' Ravivo said.
   The army statement said six of the deportees are from the West
Bank and four from Gaza. They have all served prison terms for
anti-Israeli actions in the past and some are still in jail.
   ``All 10 are activists in the various terrorist organizations,''
the statement added, referring to factions of the PLO.
   No date was given for when they would be expelled and the
statement said the men would be allowed to appeal the order to a
military advisory board and to the Supreme Court.
   They were the first Palestinians ordered deported by Israel
since it expelled American-born civil disobedience-advocate Mubarak
Awad on June 13, claiming he also played a role in the Arab
uprising.
   Israel has expelled 21 Palestinians since the uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip began Dec. 8.
   Also Friday, soldiers shot and killed a 22-year-old Arab in a
clash with stone throwers in the West Bank town of Tubas, hospital
officials said. At least five Arabs were wounded as clashes erupted
in Tubas, the West Bank city of Nablus and Gaza on a ``day of
confrontation'' called for by uprising leaders.
   The army said the military was investigating the Tubas death,
which raised to 216 the number of Palestinians killed since the
uprising began. Four Israelis also have died.
   Among those reported wounded were two Palestinians who were shot
in a clash later Friday outside the Farah refugee camp near Nablus.
   Jamal Al Kadoumi, 26, was shot in the neck and crashed his
vehicle, Arab reports said. He was rushed to a Jerusalem hospital
in critical condition. A second man, Ahmed Ayyoub, 22, suffered a
bullet wound in the right hand, the reports said.
   The army said it was investigating.
   Palestinians in Nablus heeded a general strike called for by
Islamic fundamentalist leaders, blocking roads with rocks, burning
tires and ordering merchants to close their shops, Arab reporters
said. Three Palestinians were wounded in a confrontation with army
troops.
   Troops barred Palestinians from entering Jerusalem to prevent
violent protests called for by underground leaders during prayers
at the city's Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites.
   In an underground leaflet, uprising leaders ordered Palestinians
to ``observe holy Al Aqsa day ... by striking painful blows at the
occupation forces.'' But the army measures and a police force twice
the size of normal succeeded in preventing protests at the mosque.

<HEAD>Store Manager Fired For Racist Memo</HEAD>

   A department store has apologized and
fired a manager over a memo that told employees to turn away black
customers who tried to return linen, but civil rights groups
remained outraged over the incident.
   Frank Arnone, president of Marshalls discount stores, said
Thursday he was ``personally embarrassed and appalled.''
   ``I apologize to Miss (Cynthia) Sterling and every person who
has been so greatly offended,'' said Arnone.
   A sympathetic Marshalls employee had pointed the memo out to
Sterling when she tried to exchange an $80 comforter on July 2 to
get clothes for her daughter.
   The memo, posted under glass at a cashier's counter, read: ``If
any black person returns any sheet sets, refuse a cash voucher or
exchange or credit for any reason.''
   Eva Vidal, a store manager, implied that the comforter had been
stolen because Sterling didn't have a receipt, Sterling said, but
declined to check store records. Vidal was fired for writing the
memo, company officials said.
   The local chapter of the NAACP plans a meeting to discuss the
incident and a possible boycott of the Woburn, Mass.-based company
with 297 stores.
   ``I think it's outrageous, for something like that to take place
in this day and time in southern Alameda County,'' said Venius
Winn, president of the Hayward National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. ``In my observation, we've come a
long way and still have a long way to go.''
   ``I have a 4-year-old girl who won't stop asking, `Why can't we
do this, Mama? Because we're black?' It's very hard to explain to
her that I couldn't do something because I was black,'' said
Sterling, a 24-year-old former kindergarten teacher.
   Vidal did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press
on her telephone answering machine.
   Oakland attorney John Burris said he has filed a complaint with
the Alameda County district attorney's office consumer complaint
division. He said Friday he is trying to find out if others were
victimized and whether the store may have similar but more subtle
policies in other departments.
   Arnone said Marshalls will also investigate to determine if the
incident was isolated.
   Burris said Sterling was ``not happy at all'' with the apology,
which she felt came only after the problem was publicized. Vidal's
firing was appropriate, he said, but the apology ``might not be
enough.''
   Lucy Flores, 29, of Union City, who was in line with Sterling,
said she was also angered by the memo. ``A lot of customers were
just tripping over this, looking around at each other,'' she said.
   The company's regional operations director, Dave Nielsen, said
Marshalls is an equal opportunity employer and that another manager
of the Newark store is black.

   Another sizzler hit much of the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes
states Friday, and temperature records again fell in more than a
dozen cities.
   Pittsburgh's 99 degrees broke a mark that had stood since 1876,
and the mercury in Akron, Ohio, also rose to 99, breaking a record
set in 1893.
   Other record high temperatures for the date were set in Alpena,
Mich., 100; Binghamton, N.Y., 94; Buffalo, N.Y., 95; Elkins, W.Va.,
93; Flint, Mich., 98; Harrisburg, Pa., 100; Huntington, W.Va., 101;
Knoxville, Tenn., 99; Mansfield, Ohio, 97; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
97; Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, Pa., 97; South Bend, Ind., 97;
Williamsport, Pa., 99; and Youngstown, Ohio, 97.
   Heavy thunderstorms occurred in central Colorado and
southeastern Wyoming, and a tornado watch was in effect Friday
night for parts of those two states and Nebraska. A flash flood
watch also was issued for the eastern foothills of Colorado.
   West-central Texas got heavy rain, with the heaviest falling in
Andrews, where there were numerous reports of flooded intersections
in low-lying areas and stalled vehicles. Up to 7 inches of rain
fell in southeastern Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered throughout parts of the
Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Heavier thunderstorms in
Nebraska caused some streams to run up their banks and leave
standing water in fields.
   While numerous record high temperatures for the date were being
set, some record lows were broken: Apalachicola, Fla., 67;
Montgomery, Ala., 63; Pinson, Ala., 56; Tallahassee, Fla., 59.
   The low temperature for the nation Friday morning was 31 degrees
at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 110 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif.
   The National Weather Service predicted showers and thunderstorms
scattered across the Florida peninsula, parts of Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas and Wisconsin on Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms also
were forecast in parts of Colorado, Arizona and New England.
   High temperatures likely should be in the mid to upper 80s
throughout the Plains and parts of the Missisippi Valley. The Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and Atlantic Coast states were expected to see
highs in the 90s. Some temperatures should soar to near 100 in the
upper Ohio Valley, and between 100 to 110 in the desert Southwest.
Highs in the 70s to 80s were expected along the Pacific Coast.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq reported making jet bombing
runs along their southern war front on Friday, and the Tehran
government accused Iraq of dropping chemical weapons on three
cities in the region. Iraq denied it.
   The Persian Gulf itself again turned into an arena in the nearly
8-year-old war. The burning Greek supertanker Fellowship L was
under tow in the northern gulf late Friday, almost 24 hours after
it was attacked in Iraqi raids on shipping off Iran.
   Shipping executives in the gulf and in London said flames were
extinguished aboard the 215,780-ton Cypriot tanker Star Ray,
another victim of the Iraqi raid.
   They said no injuries were reported on either ship.
   Gulf-based executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they believe another Greek vessel on charter to the Iranians also
may have been hit. The executives said they feared the Iraqi air
raids off Iran may provoke Iran to retaliate on commercial shipping
elsewhere in the gulf.
   Tensions in the oil-rich region already ran high because of the
downing of an Iranian civilian airliner Sunday. All 290 people on
board were killed when U.S. naval missile fire downed the jetliner
in the belief it was an attacking warplane.
   An Iraqi military spokesman reported the latest raids on three
``maritime targets'' Thursday in a statement quoted by state-run
Baghdad radio.
   Since early 1984, Iraq has been attacking vessels sailing to and
from Iranian ports as part of a blockade to throttle the oil-based
Iranian economy. The targets were mainly tankers.
   Iraq's objective is to force the government of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini to accept a negotiated peace in the war between
the two gulf oil powers. Iran retaliates by attacking any merchant
vessels in the gulf, regardless on whether it's doing business with
Iraq or not.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors maritime traffic around the world, said the two tankers
were attacked Thursday night off Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal
at the head of the waterway.
   Gulf-based shipping executives, and the London-based Lloyd's
Shipping Intelligence Unit which monitors maritime traffic around
the world, said the two tankers were raided overnight off Iran's
Kharg Island oil terminal at the head of the waterway.
   It said the Fellowship L was struck at 9:10 p.m. about 30 miles
south of Kharg as it was southbound after loading a shipment of
crude oil.
   It said the engine room and crew quarters were set ablaze in the
attack, while on the Star Ray, fire broke out in the bow.
   Lloyd's later reported that the fire aboard the Fellowship L was
partially extinguished and that the tanker was under tow but that
firefighting was still in progress. It said the fire on Star Ray
had been put out.
   Both tankers are on charter to Iranian oil authorities, part of
a shuttle fleet that ferries the Kharg oil to the Larak makeshift
export terminal, about 500 miles southward in the Strait of Hormuz,
to circumvent the blockade.
   The United States deployed its Navy in the gulf last summer in
order to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers flying the American flag.
Several other Western navies protect their own flag vessels
carrying cargo through the gulf.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi jets and helicopter gunships
flew a total of 265 combat missions along the 730-mile front Friday
and that all aircraft returned safely.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, as was INA, issued a war communique saying Iranian
warplanes flew nine sorties, ``inflicting heavy casualties and
losses on the enemy'' at troop concentration points along the
northern and southern fronts.
   IRNA also reported that Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs
on the cities of Khoramshahr, Abadan and Khosrow-Abad at the same
time the areas were ``subjected to heavy artillery fire of the
Iraqi troops.''
   Iraq's official news agency later put out a communique saying
such action and saying Iraqi targets Friday were limited to oil
installations and tankers.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Move Higher in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages moved higher in June, the third consecutive monthly
increase, the government said Friday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of savings
institutions, said the national average for conventional,
single-family loans jumped to 10.75 percent in early June, up from
10.65 percent in early May.
   It was the highest rate since January, when the average was
10.97 percent.
   However, a separate report by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., known as Freddie Mac, indicates that rates eased later in
June and early this month. It said the average this week was 10.38
percent, down from 10.39 percent last week and 10.58 percent in the
week ending June 3.
   Freddie Mac averages are lower than the bank board's comparable
averages because they do not include add-on fees, known as points,
which are paid by borrowers.
   The bank board averages, which hit 11.42 percent just before the
October stock market crash, dropped steadily for five months,
hitting 10.33 percent in early March, and then began rising.
   After the brief respite in June and early this month, economists
are expecting rates to begin climbing again.
   Richard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said he expected 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages to be in the 11.25 to 11.5 percent range by the end of
the year.
   ``We had a temporary lull in interest rates during the last
three weeks of June. The dollar strengthened and that boosted the
confidence of the bond market. In the past week, though, we've seen
some renewal of concerns about inflation pressures. Today's
employment release (showing joblessness at a 14-year low of 5.3
percent in June) is going to accentuate that fear,'' he said.
   The bank board said rates for the most popular type of one-year,
adjustable-rate mortgages, those with caps on how high the rate can
increase, also rose, from 8.63 percent in early May to 8.80 percent
in early June.
   The percentage of mortgages closed with adjustable rates rose to
55 percent in June, up from 53 percent in May and 49 percent in
April.

<HEAD>IRA Attacks Kill Four, Including One of Its Own</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA claimed responsibility
Friday for two bombings and two mortar attacks that killed four
people, three of them by mistake.
   The attacks killed two civilians, a British soldier and one of
the Irish Republican Army's own men. The outlawed IRA apologized
for killing the civilians, both Roman Catholics.
   Ten civilians, including a 4-year-old girl and her grandmother,
were injured.
   Eighty families had to be evacuated when a mortar barrage missed
a police station and damaged a primary school and several houses,
police said.
   In a statement to Belfast news media, the IRA said a bomb at a
swimming pool in west Belfast was accidentally triggered Thursday
evening in an ``operation that went tragically wrong.''
   The IRA, fighting to end British rule and unite the mainly
Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic, extended its condolences to relatives of those killed.
   Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's legal political wing Sinn
Fein, denied that the IRA changed its policy of targeting the
security forces, saying ``it wasn't an attack on civilians, it was
an accident.''
   But Dr. Joe Hendron, a leader of the moderate Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, whose offices are near the swimming
pool, replied: ``Sickening apologies mean nothing to the dead and
injured. IRA savagery is with us again.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the bomb, planted against the
enclosing wall of an indoor public swimming hall, apparently was
meant to bring the wall down on a security patrol passing outside
on the predominantly Catholic Falls Road.
   Instead, it killed civilians Elizabeth Hamill, 60, and Eamonn
Gilroy, 24.
   Among the four injured were Ellen McCormick and her 4-year-old
granddaughter, Ciara Burns.
   Mrs. McCormick said they went to buy ice cream and were walking
past the pool ``when the wall seemed to come out towards us. Ciara
started to scream and there was blood running all over me. She had
blood on her dress.''
   Both suffered cuts to the legs and other minor injuries.
   Seven hours later, a British army bomb disposal expert helping
to clear the area was killed yards away by another bomb, police
said.
   Unconfirmed reports said Warrant Officer John Howard's foot set
off the explosion. He was the 400th soldier to die in nearly 20
years of violence in the province.
   The IRA said one of its member, Seamus Woods, 22, died in a
mortar attack on a police station at Pomeroy in County Tyrone early
Friday. One shell exploded inside the station's perimeter fence but
caused little damage, police said.
   Woods' body was found in a field outside town, near a tractor
and trailer used in the attack, police said.
   The officers said that since police fired no shots, Woods' death
apparently was connected with the mortar fire itself.
   A second mortar attack 15 minutes later missed the police
station in Stewartstown, about 10 miles away, but damaged a primary
school and houses. Six civilians suffered minor injuries, police
said.

<HEAD>Jackson: No Veto Over Dukakis' VP Choice</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson said Friday he has no veto over the
running mate Michael Dukakis will pick and he doesn't want to
appear to have one.
   Jackson made the comment in the process of distancing himself
from his campaign manager's disparaging remarks about Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate.
   The civil rights leader, who has been pushing for an offer of
the No. 2 spot himself, said his campaign does not have a veto over
Dukakis' choice and does not ``choose to exercise the appearance as
though we have a veto over anyone in the process.''
   As for his own chances, Jackson spoke in terms of knowing the
rules and fitting qualifications.
   ``The issue is not so much who will be in office _ who will be
governor, who will be on the Supreme Court _ as that there are
rules, based on a tradition, on which we have been locked out,'' he
said.
   ``The hoop is too small,'' he said. ``I may not fit the rules,
but I know what they are, I can teach them to my children and they
will learn.''
   His comments on not having a vice presidential veto were in
reaction to a Boston Globe story. It said Gore had become a leading
contender and quoted Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin as
saying such a choice by Dukakis would outrage Jackson supporters
and increase the Republicans' chances of winning black votes in the
November election.
   Jackson told reporters Austin was speaking only for himself.
   ``I have not made any negative statements, either privately or
publicly, on any value judgment'' concerning potential vice
presidential candidates, Jackson said. ``I think it would be
unethical to do so.
   ``Throughout our campaign, we have kept a moral tone'' on the
subject, he said. ``We will keep talking that way because it's good
for the process, it's good for the party, it's good for the
country.''
   Jackson was in Dallas to address the same League of United Latin
American Citizens convention that Dukakis and likely Republican
presidential nominee George Bush spoke to earlier this week.
   He drew cheers from the group when he declared that if Bush is
serious about helping Hispanics he should be calling for
appointment of one to replace Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Bush promised the group on Wednesday that he would appoint a
Hispanic to his Cabinet if elected president. But Jackson said if
that's so, Bush should recommend ``right now an Hispanic to replace
Ed Meese.''
   ``Bush came through here the other day talking about his
conversion to a new religion _ respecting Hispanics is a new
religion of his,'' Jackson said.
   On the subject of vice presidential considerations, Jackson told
reporters that his campaign staff attempted to call Dukakis'
campaign manager Paul Brountas late Thursday night, but Brountas
then called Jackson Friday morning.
   ``He was coming here for us to have a meeting,'' Jackson said.
``And he said he is still accumulating data and responding to the
data, and we will meet at some subsequent time, not very far from
now for a rather extended oral interview.''
   Jackson said putting him on the ticket as Dukakis' running mate
would give voters a balance between two candidates of divergent
economic and geographic backgrounds, he said. But he also said it
was Dukakis' decision _ if the Massachusetts governor is confirmed
as the presidential nominee.

   Republican George Bush vowed Friday to
``never, ever under any circumstances'' pay reparations to the
Iranian government for the downing of a civilian airliner, though
he said payments to victims' families are being considered.
Democrat Michael Dukakis said he favored ``humanitarian
assistance'' in the case.
   Under the torrid summer sun, it was a day for each of the
nominees-to-be to campaign hard on the other's turf.
   In Atlanta, where the Democrats gather in ten days for their
national convention, the vice president tried to shrug off
Democratic charges that his cash-starved campaign was illegally
using tax dollars to keep going.
   In Texas, where Bush votes, Dukakis campaigned with a potential
running mate, homestate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, amid indications that
the Massachusetts governor's search for a vice presidential choice
may be entering its final days.
   ``I'm pondering,'' Dukakis said of the Senate Finance Committee
chairman at a rally in Texarkana, Texas. ``He could make a great
contribution in this country in many, many ways. He already has.''
   Bentsen seemed to minimize his chances of being the choice,
saying when asked if he wanted the job, ``I don't think we have to
worry about that.''
   Dukakis also campaigned in Phoenix, accompanied by former
Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a former nomination rival, and Gov.
Rose Mofford. He then left for Los Angeles.
   With new pressure on the Democratic nominee-to-be from Jesse
Jackson's camp, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas and Jackson
put off a meeting to discuss the vice presidential situation.
   Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin said Dukakis should not
pick presidential also-ran Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, one of the
men under consideration. But Jackson himself said in Dallas that
Austin was speaking for himself and that he, Jackson, had ``not
made any negative statements, either privately or publicly'' on
other vice presidential prospects. ``It would be unethical to do
so,'' he said.
   He said his campaign has no veto over Dukakis' choice and does
not ``choose to exercise the appearance as though we have a veto
over anyone in the process.''
   Jackson spoke to the League of United Latin American Citizens,
the same group that Bush told earlier this week that he would
appoint a Hispanic American to his Cabinet. Jackson drew cheers
from the crowd when he declared Bush should recommend ``right now
an Hispanic to replace Ed Meese'' as attorney general.
   Dukakis, beginning a six-state campaign swing, suggested he
would back aid to the families of the 290 people who died when a
U.S. cruiser shot down an Iranian airliner Sunday over the Persian
Gulf.
   ``I think some form of humanitarian assistance can, ought to be
seriously considered,'' Dukakis said in answer to a question about
reparations. ``I'm as anxious as members of Congress and the
American people to get the results of the investigation ... but I
would think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be
appropriate.''
   Asked about the issue of reparations, Bush said in Atlanta that
he feels ``terribly sad for the families of those people'' killed
in the attack and repeated his understanding that payments to the
families are under consideration by the Reagan administration _ but
not reparations.
   ``I would never, ever under any circumstances offer reparations
to the Iranian government,'' he said.
   The Republican nominee-in-waiting was in Atlanta for a GOP unity
rally 10 days before the Democratic convention convenes there.
   But Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk got to
Atlanta ahead of Bush to declare at a news conference that evidence
``strongly suggests'' improper spending by the vice president's
campaign.
   In a letter to White House counsel A.B. Culvahouse, Kirk said
Bush ``is conserving his limited remaining resources'' by not
reimbursing the federal government for the use of Air Force Two and
other vice presidential benefits during two June political trips.
   With only 13 days to go before the vice presidential roll call
at the Democratic convention, there was a swirl of reports about
the selection process. Scripps-Howard News Service reported that
Bentsen and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida had been dropped from the
top of the list.
   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said any reports of who was
rising or falling on the list could be dismissed as ``baloney.''
   With Dukakis on the campaign trail, the news from his home state
was mixed for the candidate who boasts of his record of running the
state government efficiently and helping keep the state's economy
booming.
   The Massachusetts Legislature finally sent a new $11.75 billion
state budget to Dukakis' desk, seven days late and perhaps needing
even more cuts to keep it in balance. Dukakis has already backed
two tax hikes to keep the income and expenses in balance.
   And the state dropped off the top rung of the honor roll for
unemployment.
   Joblessness in the state jumped from 2.8 to 3.5 percent in June,
making it the first time in 51 months that Massachusetts was not
first or tied for first among 11 industrial states for the lowest
unemployment rates.

   A landslide crashed through an ethnic Tibetan
community in northwest China and killed at least 41 people, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   Xinhua said the landslide came after a rainstorm and buried
homes under mud and rocks Wednesday in Jone, a county seat in a
Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Gansu province. Jone is about 90
miles south of Gansu's capital of Lanzhou.
   The news agency said the avalanche swept away many houses and
destroyed local electrical facilties.
   Xinhua said rescue efforts were still under way, but did not say
if any survivors were expected to be found or whether the toll was
expected to rise.
   It quoted an unidentified local official as saying about 10,000
people were affected, apparently by the power cutoff.

   Vice President George Bush said Friday that
allegations he has used public money for campaigning are just the
latest attack from the Democrats in a battle the Republicans are
only now turning into ``a two-way street.''
   Bush, at a news conference before a GOP fund-raising rally, said
in answer to a separate Democratic charge _ that he has gone back
on his no-tax-increase pledge _ that his definition of a tax
increase does not include the new levies on the elderly for
catastrophic illness coverage.
   He also said he might support paying reparations to the families
of the Iranian citizens killed when a U.S. Navy ship downed an
Iranian jetliner this week _ but not to the Iran government.
   In an evening address at the Republican rally, Bush stressed
national defense policy and contended Democrat Michael Dukakis, who
is expected to be his presidential rival in November, would leave
the United States generally depending on the United Nations to keep
world peace.
   ``Multilateralism seems to be my opponent's answer to Soviet
aggression,'' he told the gathering of GOP activists, including
most of his former rivals for the Republican presidential
nomination.
   ``Now he's proposing to cut the MX, Midgetman and SDI,'' the
Strategic Defense Initiative also known as Star Wars, he said,
adding: ``pre-emptive concessions are no way to bargain with the
Soviets.''
   Bush also attacked Dukakis' attempt, as governor of
Massachusetts, to block a president from deploying a state's
National Guard units without the governor's permission.
   ``You can't run a foreign policy if 50 state governors each have
the right to veto a presidential decision,'' Bush said. ``Thank
heavens (that) the courts rejected the case and didn't hamstring
the president's ability to defend our nation,'' he added.
   However, Bush's news conference was dominated by questions about
whether his campaign was properly repaying the government for the
costs of campaign trips on Air Force planes. Democratic National
Chairman Paul Kirk on Friday said he was raising the question with
the White House counsel in regard to two recent outings.
   ``We are not abusing the public trust,'' Bush said, calling it
``an outrageous charge.''
   The vice president, speaking to reporters earlier on the trip
from Washington, said, ``We've bent over backwards to be within the
letter, certainly the spirit of the law.''
   At the news conference, he said, ``If you abide by the law,
whatever you do is fair.''
   Bush put forward his campaign attorney, Ede Holiday, to answer
questions from reporters. She was unable to provide details about
how much of the trips were paid by the campaign and how much by the
government, but said it was determined by long-standing formulas.
   Bush said the intensity of Democratic attacks was no greater
than it had been for several months but that his campaign was
firing back.
   ``It's only now we're beginning to make it a two-way street,''
said Bush, who has for some time been deploying GOP officials to
attack Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee, at events around the
country.
   The trip to Atlanta made it the second straight day the vice
president was invading what might be considered enemy turf. He
spoke to a Greek audience in Dukakis' Boston hometown on Thursday
night, and Atlanta will be the site of the Democratic National
Convention the week after next.
   Bush said the timing of the Atlanta appearance was not aimed at
the Democrats.
   ``We are not going to rain on their parade. That is not to say
we're not praying for rain,'' he said.
   Asked about Dukakis' statement that Bush's support of the new
catastrophic illness insurance program amounted to support of a tax
boost, the vice president said the increased levies on the elderly
to finance the program amounted to something different _ ``a
premium.'' He said that fit in with his earlier exclusion of ``user
fees'' from his no-tax pledge.
   ``I think the voters know what I'm talking about,'' he said.
   Bush said President Reagan's support of several tax bills during
his presidency didn't mean he himself would eventually do the same.
``What's that have to do with what I'll do as president?'' he asked.
   The vice president also expanded his criticism of Dukakis'
statements favoring a conventional weapons modernization program,
saying the Democrat was anti-nuclear-weapons to the degree that
``he moves us to a very different form of deterrence'' that would
be more costly.
   Bush said he felt ``terribly sad for the families of those
people'' killed in the downing of the Iranian Airbus and added that
the National Security Council was considering the matter of
reparations.
   ``I would never, ever under any circumstances offer reparations
to the Iranian government,'' he said.
   Dukakis said Friday in Texarkana, Texas, ``I'm as anxious as
members of Congress and the American people to get the results of
the investigation ... but I would think some form of humanitarian
assistance would probably be appropriate.''

   The former top education adviser to Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis was sentenced Friday to 2{ years in prison and ordered
to pay up to $80,000 to the state in restitution for skimming money
from a program he ran.
   Gerard T. Indelicato, 42, was ordered to surrender to federal
officials Aug. 5. Where he will serve his prison term has yet to be
determined.
   He had pleaded guilty in federal court in April to five charges
of conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme with three
others to bilk an adult education program of some $80,000.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants said Indelicato would be
eligible to seek parole in 10 months. Based on precedent,
Indelicato would likely serve 12 to 18 months in prison, Gants said.
   The sentence handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Douglas
Woodlock was half the five-year term Gants recommended. But the
judge said it was more severe than most similar cases.
   Woodlock said it was important ``that white-collar pickpockets
are subject to the same punishment as those who use cruder
implements.''
   Under a plea bargain, Indelicato testified in the trial of
Michael Freedman, whom federal prosecutors identified as one of the
``minor players'' in the scheme. Indelicato was considered the
mastermind behind the plan that involved paying inflated rent and
receiving some of the money back, taking the salaries of fictitious
employees and skimming funds intended to pay for classroom
renovations.
   Indelicato has said he wondered whether the case would have
drawn the same level of publicity if he had no links to Dukakis,
the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
   All of the alleged activities occurred between 1979 and early
1983 and ended a few weeks prior to the time Dukakis named
Indelicato his chief education adviser.
   Dukakis has condemned Indelicato's activities and has said his
administration is cooperating fully with all pending
investigations. Indelicato is the highest ranking member of
Dukakis' administration to face criminal indictment.

   President Daniel Ortega said
Thursday that the rebels were deploying land-to-air rockets that
could endanger civilian planes. He said the U.S. downing of an
Iranian A300 Airbus was an example of what could happen in
Nicaragua.
   The president also accused the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, of breaking the nearly 4-month-old cease-fire.
   He blamed the Reagan administration for the developments.
   Referring to the airliner disaster, Ortega said, ``The Contras
could do the same thing here. We now are experiencing the effects
of the dirty, illegal war and of the terrorist activity that has
been approved.''
   The Iranian jetliner was shot down by missile fire from the USS
Vincennes last Sunday, with the loss of 290 lives, in the mistaken
belief that the plane was an attacking F-14 fighter jet.
   Earlier Thursday, pro-Sandinista newspapers said rebels firing
mortars and rifles killed two children along the Caribbean coast.
   The purported attack on a Miskito Indian village Saturday was
among a series of increased raids reported in recent days as
violating the truce.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Lackia Saballos, 5, and
Efram Martinez, died in a pre-dawn attack from rebel mortars and
rifles fired from the Honduran side of the Coco River.
   Ortega said in a nationally broadcast meeting with coffee
workers in the northern city of Matagalpa: ``The cease-fire has
been broken. They (the rebels) are deploying at this moment
land-to-air rockets, putting civilian aviation in danger.''
   Ortega did not say that he would end the truce his government
has extended unilaterally until the end of July. The Contras
agreed, but did not specify how long it would last.
   ``They are beating the war drums, and because of that we should
not let down our guard but rather repulse those criminals,'' Ortega
said.
   The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinista government
since 1981.
   The Sandinistas had played down reported violations of the
truce, which began March 21, two days before the government and
Contras signed an agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the
war. On Monday, however, the Sandinistas issued their first monthly
casualty bulletin since March.
   The Defense Ministry reported 87 rebels killed and 31 wounded in
combat in June. It said 15 soldiers were killed and 62 injured. The
figures indicate that substantially more fighting was under way in
the isolated mountainous regions than was previously revealed.
   The government also said 184 civilians were kidnapped by the
rebels last month. On Wednesday the Defense Ministry said nine
civilians were kidnapped in northeastern Rio Blanco.
   Last Monday, a land mine blew up a military truck in central
Chontales province and killed seven non-combatants, according to
the government.
   The Contras denied responsibility for that attack.
   Reports of renegade Contras opposed to a negotiated settlement
surfaced almost immediately after the peace agreement was signed by
rebel leaders, who live in Miami and Costa Rica. Contra ranks are
deeply divided.
   Both sides agreed to suspend offensive military operations. The
Sandinistas twice extended a cease-fire that ended May 30. The
current truce, according to the government, runs out July 31. The
Contras prolonged the cease-fire without giving a date.
   A series of high-level talks since the March meeting have failed
to define ways to end the war that has killed more than 26,000
Nicaraguans and shattered the economy.
   The last round broke off June 9 when the Contras responded to a
government proposal with a new plan that went beyond points agreed
upon earlier. It would have disbanded the the supreme court,
established a constituent assembly and immediately freed all
political prisoners.
   The Sandinistas bowed to a Contra demand to move toward
democratic reforms but the rebels said it didn't go far enough.
   The government called for new talks to be held July 27. But the
Contras rejected the proposal.
   The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979, concluding a
revolutionary war that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist,
pro-American Somoza dynasty.

   The federal court sentenced five
civilians to prison terms ranging from nine to 12 years on Friday
for their involvement in the January takeover of Buenos Aires'
metropolitan airport.
   An armed band seized Jorge Newbery Airport for four hours early
Jan. 18 in sympathy with a three-day rebellion led by former Lt.
Col. Aldo Rico at the Monte Caseros army camp in northeastern
Argentina.
   The civilians convicted of rebellion and interrupting air
traffic were: Oscar Hugo Calzada, sentenced to 12 years; Enrique
Calzada and Alberto Telias, 11 years each; Guillermo Ferrari, 10
years, and Rafael Cobo, nine years.
   Juan Jose Ariza and Daniel Cedres were absolved of all charges.
   Five other army camps also rebelled briefly before the uprisings
ended the same day with the rebel chief and 328 soldiers
surrendering. Rico is in a military prison awaiting trial.
   Rico was demanding an end to prosecution of officers accused of
human rights atrocities during the 1976-83 ``dirty war,'' when the
military ruled Argentina.
   The rebellion was the second led by Rico since April 1987, when
three revolts in camps at Campo de Mayo in suburban Buenos Aires,
Cordoba and Tucuman convulsed the government of President Raul
Alfonsin, in power since 1983.

   ``There are less than 90 days left for the plebiscite,''
Pinochet told a rally of his supporters in this port city 330 miles
south of Santiago, the capital.
   The 72-year-old president and army commander, who has ruled this
South American nation since a 1973 coup, is considered the most
likely candidate for the balloting, a yes-or-no vote on a single
candidate.
   Chile's Constitution allows Pinochet to seek re-election and in
his speech, he said he already has a government platform for the
next presidential term, but declined to disclose it.
   Pinochet did not mention a specific date for the vote, but his
remark before a cheering audience at a sports arena seemed a clear
confirmation that the military government is planning the
plebiscite for September or October this year.
   According to a 1980 military-drafted Constitution, Chile's next
president will be elected in a plebiscite in which Chileans will be
able to vote only yes or no on one candidate nominated by the heads
of the three armed services and the national police.
   Pinochet, as commander-in-chief of the army, will be one of the
four military leaders making the nomination.
   If the single candidate is approved by voters, he will serve an
eight-year term starting March 11, 1989.
   If the candidate is rejected, an open presidential election
should be called within one year, with Pinochet remaining in power
until then.
   In his speech today, Pinochet blasted his opponents and said,
``we will wipe them out'' in the plebiscite.
   The opposition, which unsuccessfully tried to prevent the
plebiscite and promote a competitive election instead, has now
united to urge citizens to vote no in the referendum.
   Sixteen political parties, from left to right, have joined in a
``National Command for the Vote No'' campaign. The outlawed
Communist Party said it would participate in the plebiscite
supporting the opposition stance.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressmen Probe Human Rights In Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay said Friday upon
his arrival here with three other members of Congress that
political prisoners in Nicaragua are being overlooked in the search
for peace in Central America.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government acknowledges the
existence of more than 3,000 political prisoners.
   The four members of Congress said they wanted to take a
first-hand look at the human rights situation in Nicaragua.
   ``We were very concerned that during this whole peace process
that we've forgotten the most important people here _ that's the
political prisoners,'' DeLay, a Texas Republican, told a news
conference at Managua airport.
   ``We're very concerned about the conditions and reasons they are
being held.''
   Release of the prisoners is called for by a Central American
peace plan signed by the region's five presidents on Aug. 7, 1987
and a cease-fire agreement reached in last March by the Sandinistas
and Nicaragua's U.S.-backed rebels.
   The Sandinistas pardoned and freed more than 900 political
prisoners last November as a goodwill gesture to get truce
negotiations going. More than 3,000 remain jailed.
   The truce still holds, despite occasional clashes.
   ``We are hoping with our visits to, once again, make sure our
concerns on political prisoners are heard,'' Rep. Beverly B. Bryon,
D-Md., said.
   Also visiting Nicaragua were Reps. Robin M. Tallon, D-S.C., and
Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev. Both are sponsors of a resolution
calling on the Sandinistas to comply with the Central American
peace plan.
   The congressional team said their trip was not linked to
speculation in Washington about renewing U.S. military aid to the
rebels, known as Contras. The United States has been supplying such
aid off and on since the rebels began fighting to overthrow the
Sandinistas in 1981.
   The peace plan, which aims to negotiate an end to the civil war
in Nicaragua and leftist insurgencies in Guatemala and El Salvador,
also calls for political amnesties; an end to outside interference
and provision of military aid to insurgents, and reforms to bring
greater democracy to the region.
   ``If the government wants to tell their story, this is their
chance,'' DeLay said.
   The four representatives are scheduled to meet over the weekend
with opposition and government leaders.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Will Not Charge Mofford</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor will bring no charges against
Gov. Rose Mofford even though he said she violated financial
disclosure laws and the state procurement code.
   ``I think Governor Mofford would agree that she did something
wrong,'' Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins said.
   However, he added, whatever she did wrong was not serious enough
to warrant prosecution.
   Arizona law says an officeholder or candidate who ``knowingly
files an incomplete financial disclosure statement is guilty'' of a
misdemeanor, but Collins said Mrs. Mofford's violations were ``just
not the kind of level where you impose criminal sanctions ... It's
just not worth the candle to the taxpayers.''
   Mrs. Mofford said: ``Obviously I am relieved that this
investigation has concluded and I can continue to lead Arizona
without any doubts about my integrity. It feels good to be
exonerated from these charges because every decision I have ever
made in public service has been for the benefit of the state of
Arizona.''
   Later, during an appearance with presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis, she complimented Collins
and his staff and said several times, ``I'm very pleased.''
   Her attorney, Mike Hawkins, said Mrs. Mofford planned to follow
up by calling for establishment of an ethics commission, but her
press secretary, Vada Manager, said such talk was premature.
   Collins' office was asked by Attorney General Bob Corbin to look
at omissions from financial disclosure statements Mrs. Mofford
filed over the last 10 years and at thousands of dollars in state
money that went for gifts and office decorations while she was
secretary of state.
   No record exists of where most of the gifts went, and Mrs.
Mofford has no recollection.
   But they were ``all arguably given in the state interest'' and
``they lack any clear element of personal gain in a thoroughly
private capacity,'' Collins told a news conference.
   Some of the items were purchased in technical violation of the
state procurement code, but Mrs. Mofford's office followed
procedures that were parallel to what the state procurement office
would have done in any case, Collins said.
   Omissions from her financial disclosure statements were not
``significant in that they did not involve large amounts of money
or personal gain for Governor Mofford,'' Collins said.
   The investigation began after The Associated Press reported in
April that Mrs. Mofford had failed to list numerous land, loan and
partnership dealings in financial disclosure forms covering the
past 10 years.
   It was broadened in May after the AP reviewed five years of
bills paid by the secretary of state's office and found more than
$50,000 spent on items that included a joke-writing service, dolls
and expensive watches. The review also found Mrs. Mofford had
bought about $10,000 worth of U.S. and Arizona flags from
unauthorized vendors at higher prices than the flags could have
cost if purchased from state-approved vendors.
   As secretary of state, Mrs. Mofford was in charge of ensuring
that financial forms were easy to fill out. She initially referred
to the AP story as nitpicking but later filed amended reports,
saying that she had made ``an honest mistake.''
   Mrs. Mofford, elected as secretary of state, became acting
governor in February after the House impeached Gov. Evan Mecham on
charges that he falsified his financial disclosure statements,
misused money from a state gift fund and obstructed an
investigation by Attorney General Bob Corbin.
   She became governor April 4 when the Senate convicted Mecham of
misusing state money and obstructing justice.

   An air force plane crashed and
exploded Friday as it tried an emergency landing shortly after
takeoff in southern Brazil, killing five people and injuring four
others, TV Globo said.
   The Brazilian-made plane had just lifted off with nine crewmen
aboard for a test run at the Aerospace Technological Center in Sao
Jose dos Campos, 275 miles west of Rio de Janeiro, when it
developed engine trouble, the network's report said. It attributed
its information to the Air Force Ministry.
   When the plane tried to make an emergency landing, one of its
wing tips hit the runway, setting off an explosion that killed five
of the crewmen and injured the other four, the TV report said.
   Four of those aboard were military personnel and five were
technicians, the report said.
   Comment was unavailable from the Air Force Ministry, which was
closed. An official at the Aerospace Technological Center confirmed
an accident had occurred but said he could not give details.

   City officials said Friday that a lack
of evidence may keep investigators from ever determining the cause
of a tragic department store roof collapse.
   Feliz Munoz, a Brownsville building official, said the
investigation will be difficult ``because the building is
completely demolished ... and we have practically no evidence
there.''
   The roof of the three-story building collapsed during a
torrential rainstorm, and the cave-in took both interior floors
with it, leaving a massive pile of rubble and little else,
officials said.
   There may not be much more evidence in city archives.
   Munoz said the city building department transferred its
documents to a storage room at the airport a few years ago, but
that room was flooded earlier and the documents destroyed.
   Another building official, Tony Yzaguirre, said that although he
wasn't a city employee when the structure was rebuilt, ``I'm sure
it was inspected. It's a normal procedure.''
   Yzaguirre said inspectors check buildings only when they are
first constructed and the only periodic inspections come from the
fire department, which makes sure there are enough fire exits and
that they open.
   A spokeswoman in the tax office, Iliana Ramirez, said the land
and store, including inventory, were worth $282,838 when appraised
last year. She said the building was valued at $210,928 and the
property was valued at $71,910.
   Frutoso Gomez, an official with the Cameron County Appraisal
District, said Friday the building was once called the Miller Hotel
and that it had been damaged in 1967 and rebuilt in 1968.
   He didn't know what the damage had been, or if owner Bernard
Levin was the owner who had it rebuilt. His records only went back
to 1982, he said.
   Hurricane Beulah hit in 1967, dumping 10 to 20 inches of rain
over most of South Texas.

   Residents of parts of the Midwest were warned Friday of
unhealthy air pollution trapped by the stifling heat wave, and
Wisconsin officials said rural school projects will be delayed
because the drought will cut taxpayers' income.
   A Canadian official said that country would block a proposal to
divert water from the Great Lakes down the Illinois River to the
Mississippi. Iowa's governor declared a statewide disaster because
of the drought.
   A shallow chokepoint in the shallow lower Mississippi was
dredged out near Natchez, Miss., to let barge traffic move again.
And because the river is carrying less sewage and industrial
pollution, Louisiana has reopened thousands of acres of oyster beds
that were closed for 20 years.
   The White House said President Reagan will travel Thursday to
the Midwest to talk to farmers, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said
he will have lunch next week with the president and push for
drought-relief measures.
   A group of U.S. senators Friday asked President Reagan to send
more water from the Great Lakes into the record-low Mississippi
River, a plan Canadian Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn said that
country would oppose.
   The senators' request came after government officials met in
Memphis, Tenn., with members of the River Industry Executive Task
Force, a newly formed committee of towboat company executives.
Towboat executives say shipping delays caused by the low water will
cost their industry $60 million this summer.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley on Friday announced the
creation of a special unit headed by Vice Adm. John Costello of the
Coast Guard to deal with transportation problems that develop
because of the drought.
   ``The drought is already choking some of our riverways and
disrupting shipping,'' he said. ``Repercussions from the lack of
rain and record-setting high temperatures can affect the nation's
entire economy.''
   Record temperatures were reported Friday in at least 20 cities
across the Midwest and into Tennessee and upstate New York. Elkins,
W.Va., normally a cool spot in the Appalachians, hit a record 93
degrees. The National Weather Service said it was the 10th record
high or low temperature tied or broken at Elkins since June 1.
   ``We've had a kind of desertification of weather _ a wide range
of day and night temperatures, just like in the desert,'' said
weather service meteorologist Peter Parke in Charleston, W.Va.
   Louisville, Ky., tied its record of 102 degrees; Huntington,
W.Va., hit a record 101 and records of 100 were listed at Alpena,
Mich., and Harrisburg, Pa. Nashville tied a record of 101 that has
been on the books since 1874.
   At least 39 deaths have been blamed on hot weather since June 1,
22 of them in Missouri. Others were in Kansas, Georgia, Illinois,
Kentucky and Pennsylvania. In Lexington, Ky., more than 200 people
have applied for air conditioners from the Summer Cooling Program,
said Jack Burch, executive director of Community Action in
Lexington.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across parts of the
Plains and upper Mississippi Valley, and strong thunderstorms
dumped enough rain on parts of southeastern Nebraska to leave water
standing in fields, the weather service said.
   Three areas of Illinois were advised Friday that heat-related
air pollution was at unhealthful levels for the second straight
day, said Bob Swinford, supervisor of air quality analysis for the
state Environmental Protection Agency.
   In Cook County, which includes Chicago, a ``yellow alert''
advising people with lung or heart problems to stay inside was
issued Thursday and prevailed into Friday in certain areas after
ozone reached 200 parts per billion, 75 ppb above the federal
standard.
   The alert also signals the EPA to ask industries to voluntarily
reduce production that results in emissions contributing to the
pollution, Swinford said.
   Heavily industrialized southeastern Michigan, including Detroit,
also remained under an air stagnation advisory Friday, but
conditions had improved slightly from earlier in the week.
   Air quality in Kentucky's five major urban areas _ Ashland,
Lexington, Louisville, northern Kentucky and Paducah _ slipped into
the ``unhealthful'' category Friday because of ozone levels, the
Department of Environmental Protection said.
   Wisconsin officials warned that the crop-devastating drought
will delay maintenance and building projects by rural public
schools in many communities.
   ``It's rather difficult to go before the annual meeting with a
tax increase knowing that the majority of your taxpayers in the
area are farmers facing decreasing incomes,'' said Miles Turner,
administrator of the River Valley School District in Spring Green.
   Taxpayers, particularly farmers and farm-oriented businesses,
will be even harder pressed to handle existing property taxes,
which fund schools, because of the drought, officials said.
   David Romstad, administrator of the Parkview School District in
Orfordville, Wis., said the drought may delay a third referendum
attempt to replace the district's aging elementary school.
   ``The drought has caused everybody to real real gun-shy,''
Romstad said.
   Kentucky is planning to buy more than 10,000 tons of hay in
Oregon so Bluegrass State farmers with dried-up pastures can feed
their livestock. A 100-car train loaded with several hundred tons
of hay will leave Oregon within a month, and United Parcel Service
agreed to fly 300 tons to Louisville next week for free, said
Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette.
   ``What UPS is doing here is a miracle,'' Burnette said.
   The hay will be sold to farmers for $80 to $90 a ton. Burnette
said brokers seeking to take advantage of the drought have quoted
him prices as high as $240 a ton.
   In northeastern Ohio, hay has been selling at auction for $350 a
ton, said auction manager John Sprunger. ``That's like buying
gold.''

<TEXT>
   Deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle failed
to attend his mother's funeral service here Friday, remaining
instead in hiding as he has since his February ouster by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Family members told reporters Delvalle did not trust a
government offer not to interfere in the service and to help
facilitate the attendance of relatives.
   The offer was published in Thursday's editions of the
pro-government Estrella de Panama newspaper.
   A warrant for Delvalle's arrest has been outstanding since
Noriega, the country's de facto ruler and commander of the Defense
Forces, orchestrated his removal from office.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's
legitimate chief of state. Noriega, under U.S. indictments on drug
trafficking charges, replaced Delvalle with Manuel Palma Solis.
   Delvalle's 71-year-old mother, Abigail Henriquez de Delvalle,
died of a heart attack Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Miami. Her
body was flown to Panama Thursday.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis attended Friday's funeral service
at a local synagogue. He declined to comment to reporters
afterwards.
   Government officials attended the service, as did former Vice
President Roderick Esquivel, making his first public appearance
since he was ousted along with Delvalle in February.
   Esquivel said the political crisis had created a ``tragic''
situation in Panama.
   ``I think that the country really has descended to levels where
we are going to have to reconstruct it completely and make a new
republic,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration has applied a series of economic
sanctions against Panama in an effort to force Noriega to resign.
   The sanctions have produced a liquidity crisis in Panama, which
uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   Esquivel said the crisis was not limited ``to ousting Gen.
Noriega, it's a matter of constructing a country in whose
government all Panamanians can believe.''

<HEAD>Disabled Pilot's Solo Flight To Germany Ends In Crash Landing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disabled pilot Clark Harrison was making a solo
trans-Atlantic flight to visit the World War II battlefield in West
Germany where he was paralyzed, but he was ``pretty sure I wasn't
going to be in this life'' after his plane ran out of fuel over
Greenland.
   ``All I saw was mountains and rocks. I looked down and I saw a
little lake and it had a little green next to it and I said, `That
looks better than anything else','' Harrison said in a telephone
interview from the U.S. Air Force Base at Sondrestrom, Greenland.
   Harrison said he cut his face on the instrument panel, adding
``I'm a little bit sore,'' but otherwise all right.
   ``I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be in this life when I got
on the ground,'' said Harrison, a 63-year-old veteran. He was
piloting a single-engine, hand-controlled plane.
   Martha Foster, a spokeswoman for Shepherd Spinal Center in
Atlanta, said the Air Force would fly Harrison to the U.S. mainland
and he would return to Atlanta late Saturday.
   Harrison's trip was planned as a fund-raiser for Shepherd's
Center for Independent Living. Supporters pledged to donate up to
$1 for each mile covered by Harrison, a founding director of the
13-year-old center for patients with spinal cord injuries.
   Harrison left the Atlanta suburb of Decatur July 1 on the
4,669-mile flight. After reaching West Germany, Harrison had
planned to go to Stolberg, site of the battlefield where he was
wounded 43 years ago. City officials had planned a reception in his
honor.
   ``It was a one of those rescues that turned out the way it was
supposed to,'' said Col. Guy Sumter, commander of the Greenland
base. ``We knew he was late. We knew when he crashed, we knew where
he crashed and we found him right away.
   ``He did a real good job of getting it down. He put it down on
just about the only flat spot there was down there.''
   Harrison had been delayed by weather in Canada, leaving there
Thursday morning, three days after he had planned to reach
Greenland. He was scheduled to arrive in Germany July 11.
   He ran into bad weather off the coast of Canada and his plane
was blown off course.
   Harrison put in an emergency call for assistance as he
approached the coast of Greenland and was shocked when the call was
answered by Pat Epps, an old friend who owns Epps Air Service in
Georgia.
   ``I felt God was answering,'' Harrison said.
   Epps, who had been in Greenland on business, notified the base
that Harrison was lost and almost out of fuel. On Epps' advice,
Harrison climbed to 7,000 feet so the base could find him on radar.
   Although the plane was not very badly damaged, Sumter said it
may be impossible to remove the aircraft, which is nose-down in a
ditch next to a little pond.
   ``We've decided to leave it up there,'' Harrison said. ``It's
going to be a historical marker. I'm the first paraplegic to crash
in Greenland. A lot of people cross the ocean, but few crash into
Greenland and live to tell.''

   Independent counsel James McKay said Friday
the court order prohibiting any leak of his report on Attorney
General Edwin Meese III has been violated and that he would
investigate and seek sanctions against those responsible.
   The New York Times reported in Saturday's editions that it had
obtained portions of the report and revealed details from the
830-page document, but did not identify its source.
   Executives of the Times in New York and Washington declined
immediate comment.
   One source said the Times had acquired those portions of the
report which were made available to Meese's former lawyer and
confidant, E. Robert Wallach.
   Both Wallach and his attorney did not immediately return
telephone calls.
   McKay, who did not identify the source of the leak, said he
``regards this as an extremely serious development and intends to
investigate this matter and seek sanctions against the person or
persons responsible for this violation.''
   Sources said McKay decided against seeking any criminal
indictment of Meese although matters discussed in the report might
be reviewed by Justice Department ethics officers to see if
administrative discipline is warranted.
   The special three-judge court which appointed McKay authorized
him to give out portions of his report to individuals who were
mentioned in it, so they could have an opportunity to submit
rebuttal comments before the report is released publicly by the
court. They were given until July 14 to submit such comments.
   McKay's office said those portions were released under an order
from the court requiring that the portions be kept confidential.
Any violation of such an order would subject the violator to
potential contempt of court penalties, to be determined by the
three-judge court, McKay's office said.
   Asked about the possibility of contempt-of-court proceedings,
appeals court Judge George MacKinnon, head of the panel that
appointed McKay, said, ``We'd have to evaluate it when the
situation developed. ... Obviously, with the great number of people
that are named (in the report), it's not a great discovery to find
that something might have leaked.'' If the judges decided to
proceed, they would have to apply to a U.S. attorney's office to
make a determination on whether a contempt-of-court case would be
pressed, the judge said.
   MacKinnon said that the panel will proceed with its schedule,
which calls for comments to be submitted by people, corporations or
foundations named in the report by next Thursday. Until at least
that time, the panel will not release the report publicly,
MacKinnon said.
   McKay also provided full copies to Meese's attorneys and to
Solicitor General Charles Fried, who for the purposes of this
matter is acting attorney general.
   James Rocap, one of Meese's attorneys, would not comment on
McKay's report, despite the report that a portion of it has been
leaked.
   ``We agree with the independent counsel that it is reprehensible
for anyone to violate the court order, if in fact that has
happened,'' Rocap said. ``We intend to comply with the court order
fully and to prepare our response on a timely basis.''
   McKay submitted his report to the court Tuesday, at the
conclusion of a criminal investigation begun on May 11, 1987.
   McKay examined the involvement of Meese, at the request of
Wallach, with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. in 1981 and 1982, when
Meese was White House counselor. McKay also looked into Meese's
involvement, again at Wallach's initiative, on behalf of a $1
billion proposed Iraqi oil pipeline project in 1985.
   The independent counsel reviewed the attorney general's meetings
with and decision on behalf of executives of the regional Bell
telephone companies at a time when he held $14,000 in telephone
stock.
   McKay also looked into the fact that members of a Washington
real estate family, through a foundation, arranged to pay a
$40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife while leasing office space
to the Justice Department.
   Wallach was involved with Meese in both the phone stock and Mrs.
Meese's job.

   So fierce is the Navy's Aegis system, the 6
million-part, $1 billion weaponry used to down an Iranian jetliner,
that crewmen on the first Aegis ship coined the motto, ``If it
flies, it dies.''
   But some looking at Sunday's tragedy in the Persian Gulf say
unleashing the Aegis cruiser Vincennes in the tiny, crowded waters
was the equivalent of letting a pit bull protect a playpen.
   Analysts speculating on the attack conclude the cruiser's
defense system did exactly what it was supposed to: track and
destroy an apparent threat, suspected at the time to be an Iranian
F-14 fighter.
   But questions remain, like why Aegis' super-sophisticated
technology could not separate civilian from military air traffic,
or distinguish a 63-foot-long fighter from a 176-foot airliner.

   The odds of a catastrophic earthquake
that could kill thousands of people in Southern California are
higher than once believed, and the San Francisco Bay area faces a
similar threat, a federal report says.
   Recent concern about the so-called ``big one'' on the San
Andreas Fault has centered on the greater Los Angeles-San
Bernardino area because so much strain on the fault's north end was
released by San Francisco's great quake of 1906, which measured an
estimated 8.3 on the Richter scale.
   But a report issued Thursday by the U.S. Geological Survey and a
working group of its National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation
Council said the San Francisco Bay area is nearly as likely to

   The Army and Air Force have ordered
commanding officers to tell soldiers or airmen who test positive
for the AIDS virus that they face discharge or prosecution unless
they inform all sex partners of their condition and use condoms.
   The regulations, and a similar Navy policy, spell out rules of
behavior at issue in a number of cases in which military personnel
who have tested positive for the AIDS virus have been charged with
criminal offenses. The charges have ranged from aggravated assault
to having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results.
   In an AIDS-related court-martial scheduled to start at Arizona's
Fort Huachuca this month, defense lawyers have argued that the
defendant was not ordered either to use condoms or to inform
partners of his condition.
   All members of the military must submit to AIDS blood screening
tests, which detect the presence of antibodies and indicate whether
a person has been exposed to the virus.

   Shooting down an Iranian airliner was part
of a world plot against Iran and the nation's leaders agree the
best way of foiling it is to confront America, parliament speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday.
   Iranian news reports said three more bodies from the Iran Air
jet _ of a man, woman and child _ were found in the Persian Gulf.
   A U.S. warship shot down the Airbus A300 last Sunday, killing
all 290 people aboard. American officials said officers of the USS
Vincennes thought it was an attacking Iranian F-14 fighter.

   A ``minor degradation'' in radar aboard the
USS Vincennes was repaired before the warship entered the Persian
Gulf and played no role in the vessel's failure to correctly
identify the Iranian airliner it shot down last weekend, a Navy

   Other Pentagon officials said they were awaiting results of an
investigation to learn why the Vincennes missed air traffic
communications and other clues indicating that the Iran Air A300
Airbus was a civilian plane and not an F-14 fighter, as officers
aboard the ship believed.
   The chief of Iran's air force, Brig. Gen. Mansour Satari, told

able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the
jetliner and the airport control tower in Bandar Abbas, near the

5.3 percent, the government said Friday. Joblessness among black
youths plummeted more than 6 percentage points to its lowest level
on record.
   The 0.3 percentage point drop from May's 5.6 percent jobless
rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820,000 people _
three-fourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old _ onto America's

   When oil was king in Oklahoma, all was well
for geologists. They had steady jobs and big salaries. But the bust
sent many to the unemployment lines.
   Now, after eight months of night school, some hard-luck oil and
gas workers are hoping they don't have to look so deep for success.
They have opted for careers in hydrogeology, the study of
groundwater.
   And the drought in many parts of the country might even help
them find work.
   ``It's been an endurance test,'' said Kurt Lampi, one of the
students in the program that met three hours a night, three days a
week. ``But it has helped me in getting employment.''
   Lampi was a geophysicist for Diamond Shamrock in the Gulf of
Mexico when he was laid off in November 1985.
   He learned of the hydrogeology training program at Metro Tech in
Oklahoma City and was part of Saturday's graduating class, along
with 62 others, mostly unemployed or underemployed oil and gas
workers.
   Lampi said he has received two job offers _ one from an Oklahoma
City company and the other from a company in South Carolina.
   ``We went into this because there is a need, and the
university's role is to fill a need,'' said Wayne Pettyjohn, head
of the Department of Geology at Oklahoma State University. ``I was
aware of the market out there. Mainly people involved in
groundwater are poorly trained.''
   Pettyjohn said the idea of a crash course in hydrogeology
surfaced when he received an increasing number of telephone calls
from laid-off oil and gas workers looking for a way out of a
depressed lifestyle.
   At the time, hydrogeology courses were offered at night at
Oklahoma State, but that soon expanded to one-week short courses in
the summer.
   The big boost came, Pettyjohn said, when oilman Jack Taylor
lobbied to get $600,000 in funds from the Department of Labor's
Dislocated Workers Program for the state Deparment of Vocational
Technical Education.
   An agreement was reached for Oklahoma State in Stillwater to
supply faculty who would teach at Metro Tech in Oklahoma City.
   Although it's still too early to determine if the program will
pay off in terms of jobs for the students, Pettyjohn said, ``I've
got several letters on my desk and also phone calls from people
(companies) interested in seeing what we have to offer.''
   The drought in parts of the Midwest and South could help, he
said. ``If it continues, I would suspect people will be looking
more to groundwater as a source of supply. Therefore, (the drought)
would have a positive effect on job prospects.''
   Some students have said hydrogeology companies don't want to
take a chance on former geologists, fearing they will jump ship if
the oil industry should rebound.
   Pettyjohn doubts it. ``These people put in eight months of
intensive work. Several of them have lost their jobs. They've all
had a bad experience. They don't want to go through that again.''
   Lampi is one who insists that hydrogeology is his new career,
noting that it will pay him 75 percent of his petroleum industry
salary.
   Not everyone does so well. Pettyjohn said he knew of a former
student whose oil and gas management position had paid him
$125,000. ``If he (a hydrogeology student) starts out at $25,000,
he'll be lucky.''
   Harvey Vick decided to take the hydrogeology course even though
he still works in the oil industry.
   ``This is something to fall back on,'' he said, ``in case
something does happen to my job.''

   Inquires cheerful host Ann Magnuson, ``Are we
ready for something really avant-garde?''
   ``Oh, is it time for `thirtysomething?''' quips her companion,
Shirley, the new-age goose.
   But be assured the tip o' the hat to that whining-yuppies show
is as close as PBS' variety show of the bizarre, ``Alive from Off
Center,'' will get to network television.
   The anthology-variety series, a production of KTCA in
Minneapolis-St. Paul, begins its fourth madcap season tonight with
two segments, a satirical look at the advertising industry by the
producers of ``Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' and director Julien Temple's
bizarre and cynical visualization of Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' from the
anthology feature film ``Aria.''
   Avant-garde enough for ya?
   If not, tune in next week, July 18, for ``Alter Image,'' a
collection of performance-art video selections by new-wave British
performers.
   The first of these is a hilarious send-up, ``Love Me,
Gangster.'' In high-resolution black-and-white against cartoon
backdrops _ kind of a video comic strip _ a mob war ensues in
nearly indecipherable Cockney accents. Of course, the violence has
been precipitated by a typical love triangle in which a buxom babe
inspires a love-struck gangster to pant hysterically, then rip off
his clothes _ all his clothes, in one big swoosh.
   Other segments include a music video, ``Rory McLeod,'' the
working-class rapper and harmonica player who sings ``Farewell,
Welfare'' while walking through a cityscape, and a punk
choreography dance-rumble with garbage cans, ``Dustbin Dance.''
   Next week's installment is introduced by ``Off Center'' co-host,
photographer William Wegman and his favorite subject, his
Weimaraner, Fay Ray.
   Tonight's premiere starts off with ``Bite and Smile,'' a clever
little film that contains a lot of in-jokes about advertising _
lines like, ``OK, free-lancer. Draw!''
   The original producers of ``Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' who obviously
have spent plenty of time in the advertising milieu, go wild with
wacky characters and colorful, crazy sets that change dimensions.
One character heads off in vain search of a washroom, only to find
the hallway shrinking until he comes to a dead end inside a
miniature set on a soundstage where a television commercial is
being filmed.
   ``Bite and Smile'' is the name of a cookies-and-crackers
product, and the agency is trying to sell the uptight company
president an ad campaign involving singing potatoes, a concept he
doesn't immediately grasp.
   ``Kids love talking potatoes!'' insists the producer. ``Imagine
potatoes begging kids to eat cookies and crackers!''
   The film by Temple is from ``Aria,'' a feature movie made up of
films by 10 directors set to different opera arias. ``Rigoletto''
is Temple's theme, although his film has nothing to do with the
plot of the opera. Buck Henry and Anita Morris play an adulterous
married couple who, unbeknownst to each other, steal off to the
same motel for videotaped liaisons with their respective lovers.
   Temple shot the film at the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo,
Calif., a motel with more than 100 theme rooms, including
``caveman'' suites with rock floors and walls.
   Future segments will include dance, film, video art and comedy,
so ``Alive from Off Center'' will take viewers hungry for something
offbeat all the way through the summer.

<HEAD>Michael Warren Creates Show His Children Can Watch</HEAD>

   Michael Warren says he came up with the idea
for a show called ``Home Free'' because his children were too young
to watch him in the gritty police drama, ``Hill Street Blues.''
   ``I was on `Hill Street' for seven years,'' he said, playing
Officer Bobby Hill, ``and my children never really got a chance to
see it. Maybe it's my ego, but I wanted to do something they could
see and enjoy.
   ``I remember one day my son's class had career day. They asked
him what I did and he said actor. But he didn't know what I did. My
daughter's 11, and my son's 9, and `Hill Street' came on too late
and was too real.''
   In ``Home Free,'' which NBC will air Wednesday, Warren plays a
construction company executive who becomes the foster father of
four boys. A Navy buddy, played by Trinidad Silva, takes over the
cooking and looks after the boys, a group of street kids, black and
white.
   While he was filming the one-hour pilot, Warren brought the
dailies home for his daughter, Kao, and son, Cash, to watch.
   ``I knew I was on to something when my daughter learned all the
lines and wanted pictures of the boys,'' he said. ``My son, with
typical sibling rivalry, was looking for some way to get even with
her and put tacks in the pictures.''
   Warren teams up again with MTM Enterprises which produced ``Hill
Street.'' David Milch, a producer and writer on ``Hill Street,'' is
executive producer of ``Home Free'' and co-wrote the script with
John Romano, based on a concept by Warren. Mark Tinker directed.
   The show was passed over as a series for the fall season, but if
it gets a high rating it may be picked up as a midseason
replacement. Warren says he is enthusiastic about the show's
chances.
   ``This is a rare opportunity for the public to choose a show
they can watch,'' he said.
   ``The idea for the show is that every family goes through
change. The kids I take in have been through a lot of change, all
negative. In my household they experience the first stability,
loving and caring they've had. One of the older boys has reached an
age when he has to leave, and I have to make the younger kids
understand it's time for him to leave. We present the idea of
change being for the better.''
   Warren says he sent a videocassette of the pilot to John Wooden,
the retired UCLA basketball coach. Warren had played for Wooden in
his years there.
   ``John is the embodiment of what America's all about,'' he said.
``He loved the show. He's not a big fan of television. But he also
understood the message of `Home Free,' which is change and growth.
He was family to me, so I want him to see things I've done and
appreciate it. I know he saw `Hill Street Blues' once or twice
because I was on it, but it wasn't his kind of program.''
   Warren at first considered a career in pro basketball. ``I was
drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics,'' he said. ``They sent me a
contract in the mail. It was mimeographed with a place for me to
write in my name. I felt like it could have been addressed to
`occupant.'
   ``I felt I'd already proved myself as a basketball player. They
wanted me to try out, and if I was accepted they'd pay me $10,000.
I didn't know what I'd do with all that money, so I declined.''
   Warren began his acting career in commercials. He had several
stage roles and was in the movie ``Butterflies Are Free.'' He was a
guest star in a number of series before becoming a regular in the
1974 NBC series ``Sierra'' as Park Service Ranger P.J. Lewis, and
in CBS 1979 show ``Paris'' as Officer Willie Miller.

<HEAD>Do Job Figures Mean Inflation? Not Necessarily</HEAD>

   The sharp drop in official jobless figures
inevitably will ignite a new flareup of inflation fears, since
inflation seems to be on everyone's mind.
   Talk to car dealers and they say folks are buying because they
feel prices are bargains relative to what they could be tomorrow.
Ask real estate people and they say couples are buying to avoid
higher interest rates later.
   Brokers give similar reasons for misgivings about the future of
stock and bond markets. Economists cite inflation prospects as a
reason for forecasting an end to expansion. Workers use it to win
wage increases.
   Inflation is the all-purpose, all-American fear, resurrected
every time a new figure comes out of the Washington numbers
factories or oil prices rise or drought spreads through farmlands
or consumer spending rises.
   In part, it is a legacy of the 1970s, a time when inflation
turned the ordinary person's economic world inside out and upside
down, making fortunes for borrowers while destroying savings
accounts that had taken years to build.
   But in spite of the fears, devil inflation has not arisen from
his den. He has resisted the popular view time after time, and
there is a good chance he will continue to do so after examining
the latest employment report.
   When unemployment falls to what is thought of as the ``full
employment'' level, which is now estimated to be somewhere around 5
percent, pressure is expected on wage rates. And rising wages are
an indicator of inflation.
   The latest report shows that civilian unemployment fell to 5.3
percent in June from 5.6 percent in May, a consequence mainly of a
jump of 823,000 in civilian employment, an extreme and unexpected
figure.
   Almost nobody foresaw anything of the sort, especially since the
jobless rate had risen in May by two-tenths of a percentage point.
For it to fall one month later to the lowest figure in 14 years
just didn't fit the pattern.
   However, a strong possibility exists that the pattern hasn't
changed much, if at all. Employment and jobless figures are subject
to adjustments, and these latest figures conceivably could be
adjusted out of existence.
   The big question mark concerns the methodology, specifically the
fact that the survey week occurred late in June when students, high
school and college graduates and seasonal workers were entering the
labor market.
   In some years, this sort of influx could raise the jobless rates
sharply, for this reason: If a person isn't actively seeking work,
he or she is not a member of the labor force. They become members
by actively looking for work.
   In years of depressed economic activity, therefore, an influx of
job seekers can raise the jobless rate. But not this year. Sluggish
as the economy is said to be, business continues to expand, create
job openings and hire.
   But of perhaps more importance is that opportunities abound
these days for youngsters, even those totally unskilled, at retail
outlets. In some parts of the country, in fact, they are being
offered wages well above the minimum.
   Many shopping centers are desperate for workers, and reveal this
urgency with help-wanted signs in display windows. Some must bus
workers in from many miles away. The International Council of
Shopping Centers estimates at least 100,000 summer jobs are
avilable, most of them for teen-agers.
   Could it be that the latest job survey occurred at the very time
these jobs were being filled? As the figures are analyzed, it is
likely that this factor will be considered not just possible but
probable.
   The Labor Department itself seems to suggest that much in
pointing out that about three-quarters of the increase in jobs came
in the 16- to 24-year-old age group.
   Another factor, one that has occurred before, could be involved.
   In the May count, civilian employment dropped by 518,000 jobs.
In June, employment rose by 823,000. Did such a extreme dip and
rise actually occur? Or was there a bug in the methodology?
   Don't jump to conclusions about imminent inflation _ even if
some of the so-called authorities do.

<HEAD>American Jasper Johns Wins New Acclaim at Venice Biennale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades after Jasper Johns sent art's
avante-garde spinning off in new directions, the world's most
expensive living artist is winning new acclaim at the prestigious
Venice Biennale.
   But although the American captured this year's Grand Prix, an
award previously won by such artists as Henri Matisse and Max
Ernst, some experts feel compelled to defend the choice.
   ``There is an incredibly widespread assumption that Johns is an
old master and a pop artist, assumptions that pigeonhole him, that
do not recognize he is an artist in his prime,'' said Philip Ryland
of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, reacting to what he
called superficial criticism of the show.
   Since its beginning in 1895, the Biennale has enhanced the
reputations of artists generally not widely known outside their own
countries.
   ``Henry Moore's international reputation was established by
winning the Grand Prix for sculpture in 1948,'' said Ryland.
   Johns doesn't need the Biennale to reaffirm his role in 20th
century art. His importance is demonstrated by the price he
commands. His painting ``Diver'' sold for $4.2 million, the highest
price paid for a work by a living artist.
   About 300,000 people are expected to visit the international
exposition before it closes Sept. 25. Many will see Johns' work for
the first time. Some will come because he won the prize, others
because the domed, pink brick U.S. pavilion is the only one air
conditioned among the 25 nestled in the Biennale gardens, which
overlook the lagoon.
   Ryland said Johns is seen in this show at his high point, with
his crosshatch paintings and his most explicitly autobiographical
work.
   ``What this show reveals, not only for Europeans, is how far
Johns has developed from a few flags, targets and numbers,'' Ryland
said in an interview.
   Johns and others such as Robert Rauschenberg, who won the
Biennale's Grand Prix in 1964, created an alternative to abstract
expressionism, the dominant American style of the 1940s and 50s.
   At his first show in January 1958, Johns heralded the pop art
movement of the 60s with his paintings of common objects _ American
flags, targets and numbers.
   ``Some said art had been thrown back into the world of common
images,'' Ryland said. ``But the theft was in the opposite
direction, it was a theft of popular images. He dragged the flag
into the world of art.''
   Now, 30 years after that dramatic opening at the Castelli
Gallery in New York, Johns wins the ``Golden Lion'' in Venice, one
of the world's most influential exhibitions of modern art.
   ``It was important to give the prize to Jasper Johns,'' said
Adriano Donaggio, the spokesman for the Biennale. ``He has been a
leader of his generation, but he never got the prize.''
   Both Donaggio and Ryland emphasized that his career was only one
consideration made by the international jury and that the most
important was the show at the Biennale.
   The show put together by the Philadelphia Museum of Art is the
first major exhibition for Johns since the retrospective that
opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 1977.
   Johns works and reworks his surfaces, using oil and encaustic, a
mixture of colored pigment in hot wax. He also evokes dream-like
images with ink on plastic.
   ``His show is outstanding,'' Ryland said. ``In pictorial terms
it is much better than anything else in the Biennale.''
   He added that other renowned artists such as Cy Twombly, Enzo
Cucchi and Alberto Burri were weakly represented at this Biennale.
   Johns' works demonstrate his progression over the last 15 years,
from the crosshatch and flagstone patterns of the 70s to the
autobiographical paintings of the 1980s.
   The works in the show also include ``Scent,'' the first devoted
entirely to the crosshatch style. The painting is done in oil and
encaustic on three canvases in bright, bold, interlocking groups of
strokes at various opposing angles.
   ``Racing Thoughts'' and ``The Seasons'' are John's most
autobiographical, presenting images closely linked to the artist
such as a picture of Leo Castelli, who gave him his first show;
pottery from his own collection, the double flag; and a printed
image of the Mona Lisa that recalls his affection for both Marcel
Duchamp and Leonardo da Vinci.
   In ``The Seasons,'' four paintings done in 1985-86, Johns also
puts himself in his work for the first time by putting his shadow
among the images.
   In addition to the work of Johns and other established artists
from 44 countries are 86 ``young artists'' in the open section.
   ``There are artists here that in 10 years will be household
names,'' said Ryland.
   One could be Barbara Bloom, the American who won this year's
prize for the open section.

<HEAD>In The Dust Bowl, No Drought Now but Memories Still Vivid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT to Goodwell, Okla., sted Kan.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   The grass is green in Liberal, Kan. In Amarillo, Texas, a
meteorologist says, ``We're in good shape.'' Folks in Beaver,
Okla., were inundated last week by six inches of rain from a single
storm.
   As much of the nation is parched by drought, much of the Dust
Bowl _ the 97 million-acre confluence of New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas that turned to desert a half century
ago _ has been spared.
   ``We're above seasonal rainfall. We're in good shape, very good
shape,'' said Gary Hartley of the National Weather Service in
Amarillo.
   But blue skies and healthy crops give little comfort to Gilbert
Steinkuehler, 73. He was a teen-ager in the 1930s, working on the
family farm in Goodwell, Okla., when the region suffered an
extended drought.
   Fertile soil dried to fine dust that was picked up by scouring
winds, creating black blizzards that rolled across the plains.
Millions of tons of topsoil were simply lifted off the land.
   And Steinkuehler is certain that the same conditions could bring
those days back again. ``There's not much you can do when there's
no water,'' he said.
   In 1932 and 1933, the annual rainfall in Goodwell was nine
inches below average. ``For seven or eight years, we had no
crops,'' Steinkuehler said.
   For much of the 1930s, street lights illuminated the
thoroughfares of the Dust Bowl at midday. Trains collided in dust
clouds. Chickens roosted at noon.
   ``The dawn came, but no day,'' wrote John Steinbeck in ``The
Grapes of Wrath,'' the classic novel of the Dust Bowl.
   Homemakers in the Dust Bowl turned plates and cups upside down
on the table until meals were served, to keep them clean. In 1935,
an enterprising carpet sweeper used his vacuum to clean attics; he
removed an average of two tons of dust from each of 227 attics in
southwestern Kansas.
   ``All we could do was just sit in our dusty chairs and gaze at
each other through the fog that filled the room and watch the fog
settle slowly and silently, covering everything,'' said one woman
from Garden City, Kan.
   Shutting doors and windows tightly didn't help. After the storm,
``Our faces were as dirty as if we had rolled in the dirt; our hair
was gray and stiff and we ground dirt between our teeth,'' she said.
   Texas state senators wore surgical masks while debating
legislation. Respiratory infections claimed scores of lives,
especially among the very old and very young. Others died: a young
boy walking home from school near Hays, Kan., lost his way. He was
found smothered by dust the next day.
   ``We long for the garden and little chickens, the trees and
birds and wildflowers of the years gone by. Perhaps if we do our
part these good things may return someday, for others if not
ourselves,'' wrote Caroline A. Henderson, a 28-year-old resident of
Alva, Okla., in 1936.
   Some, like Steinbeck's Joad family, couldn't wait. In 1936, a
survey found that one in four dwellings in 45 Dust Bowl counties
had been vacated in the previous three years. In six townships of
Oklahoma's Cimarron County, all but three of the 40 farm families
left for wetter parts.
   The dust bowl lost people, but it also lost soil at a rate of
850,000,000 tons a year. On April 12, 1934, a storm removed 300
million tons of soil; within days, that dust left a film on the
president's desk in Washington, on store shelves in New York City
and on ships 500 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.
   R. Douglas Hurt, associate director of the Missouri State
Historical Society and author of ``The Dust Bowl: An Agricultural
and Social History,'' says droughts in that area are cyclical, and
the local soil is of a type that tends to break down into tiny
particles in the absence of moisture.
   The big dust storms of the 1930s, Hurt says, can be traced to
World War I, when wheat prices soared. Prices dropped during the
early 1920s, and farmers tried to recoup by planting more fields,
aided by new power machinery.
   In so doing, Hurt says, the farmers also were planting the seeds
of their own destruction. Once the sod was broken and the soil was
plowed repeatedly, it was exposed to the wind; the drought came,
the crops died, and without roots to hold the soil, it blew away.
   In the best of times, relatively few farmers practiced soil
conservation measures such as terracing and strip cropping, Hurt
says. But then a bumper wheat crop in 1931 caused prices to drop,
and even good farmers put aside conservation measures to try to
grow more wheat.
   Could it happen again?
   ``I think it's possible but I also think it's unlikely if
farmers have learned anything from the past, and I think they have.
Farmers today have the technical capabilities to handle their
fields properly,'' said Hurt.
   Soil conservation has become a fact of life; irrigation is more
prevalent, and land-grant universities have brought forth a
different kind of farmer. ``I think our farmers are too well
educated to let it happen again,'' said Emma Love, 89, a Oklahoma
Panhandle resident since 1905.
   Mrs. Love remembers ``days as black as night.'' Her father was
in real estate, and ``our real estate sure was blowing around.''
   She remembers the time her mother went to a jackrabbit roundup _
the creatures proliferated during the dirty '30s _ and was caught
in a duster: ``She told God that if she got out of it, she'd never
go to another.''
   She looks around today, and sees Dust Bowl survivors who stuck
it out. They and their children, she says, know enough to protect
the land.
   Still, she said, ``If there's someone who isn't taking care of
his land, that place blows.''

   The fatal accident, which caused a jump in world oil prices
Thursday, prompted the British government to postpone the process

<HEAD>Samurai Conflict Raises Question: What Is Safe?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Controversy over the safety of the Suzuki
Samurai has accentuated a deep rift among American opinion leaders
and the general public over a basic question: What is safe?
   Consumer Reports says the jeep-like Samurai is too tall, narrow,
light and short and thus tips over too easily when the driver
swerves back and forth at high speed.
   Supporters say that although the Samurai's high center of
gravity makes it tippier than some other vehicles, it is safe in
the hands of a competent driver.
   ``There's no easy definition of what safe or unsafe is. It's
really a continuum,'' Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a recent
interview.
   The conflict between consumerists and auto enthusiasts runs
through the public at large, said John Staudenmaier, a professor of
history and technology at the University of Detroit.
   ``One approach says the design ought to make it nearly
impossible to have an accident,'' Staudenmaier said. ``But auto
buffs would tend to say, `We're not idiots.'''
   Americans make decisions about safety every time they choose
between a car and a motorcycle, or between a big, heavy car and a
small, light one.
   Unfortunately for Suzuki, consumers' judgments about the Samurai
have been powerfully influenced by television news clips supplied
by Consumers Union that show the Samurai tipping over onto its
outriggers.
   For some people, the visual impact tends to overwhelm American
Suzuki Motor Corp.'s recitation of favorable accident statistics
and its counter-argument that nearly any vehicle can be made to tip
over by extreme driving maneuvers.
   The four-wheel-drive Samurai became one of the hottest imports
in 1986 and 1987 because of its emotional appeal as a fun, jazzy
and liberated little box on wheels.
   The charm faded in June as sales of the Samurai plunged 70.6
percent from their levels of a year earlier. It was mainly a
reaction to the June 2 report by Consumers Union, the Mount Vernon,
N.Y.-based publisher of Consumer Reports.
   Suzuki dealers are hoping sales will recover gradually in coming
months, but that will depend partly on how often the infamous
videotape reappears on the evening news.
   Editors of auto magazines tend to say that the primary
responsibility for car safety should fall on the driver rather than
the automaker.
   ``Any car has design intent. If the design intent is exceeded,
the car is going to do something weird and spooky,'' said Dennis
Simanaitis, executive editor of Road & Track.
   The Samurai had to be built high off the ground because it is
used off-road, Simanaitis said. A vehicle that can drive over
boulders and logs is by nature tippier than a low-slung sports car.
   ``If Suzuki gave no warnings it would be different, but they
have disclaimers galore,'' Simanaitis said.
   Suzuki's television ads quote a 1986 article by Car and Driver
that said ``if you want a rugged four-wheel-drive for the minimum
amount of money, the Samurai is the only game in town.''
   William Jeanes, the magazine's editor, said he stands behind
that statement.
   ``I think every car, taken to extremes, can do something
dangerous,'' Jeanes said. ``How high is too high for a center of
gravity? I don't know the answer to that.''
   Road & Track's own road test did not include the swerving
maneuver in which Consumers Union got the Samurai to tip over.
Simanaitis said he found no fault with the Consumers Union test but
added, ``If I look around hard enough, I can find a test that will
embarrass almost any vehicle except an out-and-out race car.''
   Consumers Union is calling on the government to develop
industrywide standards for for a national standard on resistance to
rollovers, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
has resisted that approach in the past.
   A strict formula for height, weight and other characteristics
could have the effect of banning certain classes of vehicles, and
courts have ruled that the federal agency should ``go to great
lengths to avoid that,'' Miller said.
   Miller said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
is seeking ways aside from design rules that would lessen rollover
problems, such as improving brakes.
   ``We recognize that there are a wide variety of vehicles, and
you don't want to deprive people of vehicles that they need or want
to use, whether it's for work or for pleasure,'' he said.

   The nation's largest general retailers report that their sales
improved in June following dismal performances in April and May,
but industry analysts say consumers still are spending cautiously
as they have all year.
   ``It's a reprieve,'' Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., said Thursday after reviewing the June
numbers. ``It does not say the consumer is going on a wild spending
spree.''
   ``It's not a great environment, but things are better than they
were,'' said Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Industry-wide, sales were up between 3.5 percent and 4 percent
last month and have risen about 2.5 percent so far this year, Ms.
Kristiansen said.
   In reaching those estimates, she considered what retailers call
same-store sales, those from stores open at least a year. Analysts
believe same-store sales give a more accurate picture of a
retailer's performance than totals that include figures from new
stores.
   Analysts said the belated arrival of hot weather lured consumers
into stores to buy summer clothing and seasonal items such as
garden equipment and outdoor barbecues.
   Walter Loeb, who tracks retailers for Morgan Stanley & Co., said
sales were aided by the markdowns retailers continued to take to
clear their inventories. Analysts were watching closely for any
effect on sales from the Midwestern drought. Monroe H. Greenstein,
an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., said sales volume was
unaffected last month, but could be in July.
   Retailers generally have been disappointed by 1988 sales, which
have not kept pace with inflation. Consumer prices rose at an
annual rate of 4.4 percent through May, according to Labor
Department figures.
   Stores have been slumping for more than a year because of
economic uncertainty and disappointment with current fashions.
Sales worsened in April and May, with cold and wet weather blamed
for the deterioration.
   Edelman said the sales pickup so far was principally
weather-related.
   Morgan Stanley's Loeb was more optimistic. Although sales were
up only moderately last month, ``it certainly points to a better
fall season,'' he said.
   Storeowners and investors watch sales figures for an indication
of retailers' earnings, while economists monitor the results as a
barometer of economic health. Consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the gross national product.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales were up 9.8 percent in June from year-earlier levels,
and rose 5 percent for the first 22 weeks of the fiscal year.
Sears' same-store sales were up 5.1 percent last month and 2
percent for the year so far.
   K mart Corp. said its overall June sales rose 7 percent, while
year-to-date sales were up 5.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.9
percent last month and 2 percent so far this year.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 32 percent in
both June and the year to date. Same-store sales were up 13 percent
in June and 12 percent for the five months.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported its overall sales rose 3.4 percent
last month and 2.6 percent for the 22 weeks. Same-store sales rose
3 percent in June and 1.6 percent for the year so far.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall June sales rose 19.6
percent and its year-to-date sales were up 18.4 percent. Same-store
sales increased 3.3 percent in June and 1.9 percent for the year to
date.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 22.3
percent last month and 10.1 percent for the year so far. Its
same-store sales were up 4.8 percent for June and 0.8 percent for
the 22-week period.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported sales increases of 11.7 in June and
12.1 percent for the year to date.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its June sales were up 3.6 percent,
and year-to-date sales rose 3.1 percent.
   The results reported Thursday are from general and apparel
retailers. Unlike the monthly retail sales report issued by the
Commerce Department, they do not include sales of car dealers,
supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>Tsutsumi Heads Forbes List of Billionaires for Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoshiaki Tsutsumi is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal
net worth of at least $18.9 billion, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, Forbes said Thursday.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
United States, estimated Tsutsumi's fortune at approximately $20
billion last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's July 25 issue.
   The designation for Tsutsumi again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last October, Fortune estimated Tsutsumi's holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ $2.5 billion.
   The second richest person on Forbes' list is also Japanese.
Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in Tokyo, is worth $18 billion, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, Mori's fortune was put at $15 billion.
   Following the two Japanese are the Reichmann brothers of Canada,
who have built a $9 billion fortune in real estate, Forbes said.
   Shin Kyuk-ho, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 ($8 billion-plus), and
Kenneth Cole Irving, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 ($8 billion).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than $1
billion, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The United States still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, Forbes noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 U.S. families are worth more than $1 billion,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place Japan and
16 in third-ranked West Germany.
   The leading American billionaire is Sam Walton, the head of
major retailer Wal-Mart Stores, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of $6.5 billion, Forbes estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in Forbes' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of Pablo Escobar
Gaviria and the Ochoa family, are each more than $2 billion, Forbes
said. It estimated the third, amassed by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
at between $1.3 billion and $3 billion.

<HEAD>New York, Chicago Exchanges Make Big Move For Post-Crash
Coordination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of delay and makeshift changes
aimed at preventing another stock crash, the two leading U.S.
financial markets have devised a joint plan of reforms they hope
will lure back frightened investors.
   The proposal announced Thursday by the New York Stock Exchange
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange included priority treatment for
individuals in the marketplace and an experimental system of
coordinated trading halts triggered by a 250-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   The boards of both exchanges also said they would develop a
joint policy regarding ``front-running,'' a controversial practice
in which traders execute an order in one market based on prior
knowledge of an order in another market.
   Front-running has been blamed for aggravating volatility in the
stock market and has been criticized by many investors and some
lawmakers as a form of insider trading, because it is based on
knowledge not available to all.
   The joint announcement by the New York and Chicago exchanges
addressed many key issues raised by government studies on the
causes of the October crash, such as the Brady Commission appointed
by President Reagan, particularly the need for intermarket
cooperation.
   Previously, the exchanges had undertaken limited steps largely
on their own, or argued that additional regulations would hamper
their post-crash recovery.
   The announcement also reflected a growing concern in the
securities industry about the prolonged absence of individual
investors, who have remained reluctant to participate in markets
since the record 508-point plunge in the Dow average on Black
Monday, Oct. 19 for fear they are unsafe and unfair.
   ``Markets have returned to more normal patterns, but there is
still a perception that individuals are at a disadvantage in
today's high-speed markets,'' NYSE Chairman John Phelan said in a
joint statement with CME Chairman Leo Melamed. ``The initiatives
approved by the boards should overcome that concern.''
   ``We have developed a program of coordinated procedures which
serve the current needs of financial markets,'' Melamed said.
``These combined initiatives demonstrate our commitment to serving
the needs of all investors and ensuring a level playing field for
all market participants.''
   All the initiatives must be approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which oversees the nation's stock markets, and
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the
futures markets.
   The steps include a new ``express lane'' system for expediting
orders of individual investors to the NYSE floor on heavy trading
days. During the crash, many individuals were unable to sell their
stock quickly because the market's system was clogged with sell
orders from large institutional investors.
   Both exchanges also proposed a one-year experimental system of
coordinated ``circuit breaker'' mechanisms to forestall panicky
selling when the Dow average is falling rapidly.
   Under this system, which must be approved by other exchanges in
addition to the federal regulators, all trading on the NYSE would
be halted for an hour if the Dow average falls 250 points, and for
an additional two hours if the average falls an additional 150
points the same day.
   At the CME, the key Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index future
could fall a maximum 30 points before trading was halted in that
market. A further two-hour halt would be called if the S&P index
future fell another 20 points the same day.
   Because a one-point drop in the S&P index equals approximately
an eight-point fall in the Dow average, the practical effect will
be coordinated halts in both exchanges. Market officials familiar
with the proposal said the two exchanges jointly would manage the
exact timing of such halts.
   The experimental reforms are aimed at taming the wild price
swings that some crash studies have attributed to a trading method
called index arbitrage, in which brokerages use computers to sell
huge blocks of stocks and buy stock-index futures, or vice versa,
to profit from momentary price discrepancies.
   The reforms would supercede a temporary NYSE measure implemented
in February called the ``collar,'' which banned use of the NYSE's
computer system for index arbitrage when the Dow average rose or
fell 50 points from the previous close. Some critics said the
collar actually worsened volatility by severing an important link
between the New York and Chicago markets.
   Wall Street firms reacted favorably to the joint announcement,
with many welcoming any step aimed at improving investor confidence.

<HEAD>Stocks Up, Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fizzled at the close of the trading week
in Tokyo today after gaining against the Japanese yen, while stocks
advanced in what traders described as moderate activity.
   After opening at 131.95 yen, the dollar closed trading only
slightly higher at 131.97 yen, down 0.33 yen from Thursday's close
of 132.40.
   Traders said the dollar recovered in midday dealings after
opening lower, but then lost steam in afternoon trading.
   ``The market is readjusting itself and waiting for
market-affecting material like seasonal U.S. trade figures due out
next Friday,'' said a dealer with a major city bank in Tokyo.
   The dealer, speaking anonymously, said there were no major
factors moving the yen-dollar market in Tokyo at present and ruled
out any effect of the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner in the
Persian Gulf last Sunday.
   On Monday, the dollar closed at 134.80 yen, its highest closing
since Nov. 24.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which declined 38.47 points Thursday, recouped its losses by
advancing 188.95 points or 0.68 percent to close the week's trading
at 27,917.08.
   Volume in the first section totaled 1.4 billion shares, compared
to Thursday's turnover of 2 billion.
   Traders said while security houses and automakers posted gains,
the market appeared to be thrashing around in search of a new
direction.
   ``It's more of the same stuff,'' said one trader. ``Interest is
just shifting around aimlessly.''
   Some traders said a lower dollar helped relieve concerns over
possible higher interest rates and inflation that have hurt the
market recently.
   Futures trading in 20-year bonds began for the first time on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today, with overall performance of the
benchmark September 2008 issues described as sluggish.
   The stock market, which opens for a half-day session on the
frist and fourth Saturday of each month, will be closed this
Saturday. There are no foreign exchange dealings in Tokyo over the
weekend.

<HEAD>June Unemployment Rate Falls; Retailers Report Improved Sales in
June</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with June unemployment figures.
Picks up 3rd graf pvs, Analysts blamed ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's June unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent _ its
best level in nearly 14 years _ as youths flooded the job market
and found a wealth of opportunity, the government reported today.
   The 0.3-percentage-point improvement from the previous month
marked the first time the rate has dipped so strongly since 1986
and sent it to its lowest since joblessness stood at 5.1 percent in
May 1974.
   The Labor Department said seasonally adjusted employment in June
jumped by 820,000 _ 75 percent of it among youths 16-24 years old _
to more than offset May's decline of 536,000.
   Unemployment among teenagers fell 2.0 percentage points to 13.6
percent, its lowest since 1970.
   Analysts had anticipated a surge in youth employment in the
tourism industry as unprecedented numbers of foreigners, buoyed by
the devalued dollar, are vacationing in the United States this
summer.
   On Thursday in the financial markets, stock prices lost ground
for the second straight session but finished well above their
midday lows. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more
than 20 points at one stage, closed with a 7.47 loss at 2,122.69.
   Analysts blamed the market's downturn partly on the recent rise
of interest rates in the credit markets. Yields on long-term
Treasury bonds have climbed lately back above 9 percent, driven
largely by recurring worries about inflation.
   Those worries were refueled somewhat Thursday, when oil prices
surged in erratic trading. They later settled below their peaks as
traders assessed the impact of a rig explosion in the North Sea and
the chances for an emergency OPEC meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil,
settled 47 cents higher at $15.83 a barrel. The contract traded as
high as $16.35 per barrel during the volatile session.
   However, prices of key farm commodities plummeted as some
private forecasters predicted rain this weekend in the
drought-parched Farm Belt.
   Despite the June boost in retail sales, industry analysts
remained generally cautious about the outlook for consumer
spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   ``It's not a great environment, but things are better than they
were,'' said Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Walter Loeb, who tracks retailers for Morgan Stanley & Co.,
said, ``There was a modest increase in retail sales,'' as hot
weather gave consumers an impetus to buy summer clothing. Other
seasonal items, such as garden equipment and outdoor barbecues,
also sold well, analysts said.
   Sales were aided by the markdowns retailers continued to take to
clear their inventories, Loeb said.
   The analysts were watching closely for any effect on sales from
the Midwestern drought.

<HEAD>London Stocks Up 19.3 Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices were sharply higher Friday, helped by
a spate of rumors and renewed strength in the dollar.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 19.3
points, or 1 percent, at 1,874.8 at midday.
   Trading activity was brisk. Volume was 340.9 million shares by
midday compared with 277.3 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   The major gainer was British Aerospace PLC, which soared 32
pence, or 55 cents, to 437 pence in heavy trading on rumors the
Saudi Arabian government planned a substantial increase to its
orders of Tornado jet fighters.
   The rumors preceded a midday announcement by the British
Ministry of Defense that it had signed a major defense agreement
with Saudi Arabia involving the supply of aircraft and specialized
Navy vessels as well as a construction program in the Arab state.
   Elsewhere, international issues were higher on renewed strength
in the dollar while certain stocks were boosted by takeover
speculation.
   The market opened stronger, encouraged by Wall Street's recovery
from its worst levels on Thursday and by a rise in Tokyo earlier
Friday, dealers said.

   Chrysler Corp. plans to send redesigned pressure
caps to owners of 240,000 1985-87 Renault Alliance and Encore cars
to prevent rupture of a passenger compartment heater component.
   Owners of the 1985-87 vehicles will be mailed pressure caps,
revised to prevent rupture of the heater core due to severe engine
overheating, Chrysler said Thursday in a statement.
   The heater core, a component located in the passenger
compartment where air is heated, would spray steam and hot water on
the driver's legs if it ruptured, Chrysler spokeswoman Karen
Stewart said.
   Chrysler said it knew of 39 incidents of injury due to heater
core rupture.
   In a separate notification, Chrysler said it would recall about
149,000 1983-84 Alliances and Encores equipped with drivers'
rocker-recliner seats for adjustment of the seat bracket.
   Stronger brackets will be made available this fall to prevent
the front attachments of the seat adjuster from separating and
allowing the seat to tip backward, the statement said.
   The company said it received about 50 reports of seat adjuster
attachment failure on 1983 and 1984 cars, including three minor
injuries.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said today
that Congress has enough money available to provide ``generous and
compassionate'' relief for dought-stricken farmers, but that not
all of those affected will survive.
   Lyng, who said after a meeting with six farm-state governors
that special drought-relief legislation is needed urgently,
commented on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show that the money still ``won't
do the thing that's really needed and provide rain.''
   Congressional committees are to start work next week on a
drought relief package.
   ``We will attempt to have legislation prepared and introduced
... if not Monday then hopefully Tuesday,'' the House Agriculture
Committee chairman Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said
Thursday.
   Lyng said today that surplus feed is available to farmers in
1,800 counties, with more counties to be added next week.
   He said there is about $17 billion in the budget for farmers,
including money already committed to crop insurance programs.
   ``I think there will be a sufficient amount to have a generous
and compassionate program of assistance,'' he said.
   Lyng said, however, that farmers who have no reserves and that
those who were heavily in debt before the drought probably will not
survive.
   ``A situation like this comes along and it becomes very
difficult to provide enough income to take care of the debt load
they have and keep them going,'' he said without estimating how
many farms might fail as a result of the drought.
   Lyng had been saying lawmakers should monitor the drought but
hold off on a relief bill until more was known about the extent of
the damage. But authorities are now forecasting serious reductions
in corn yields unless the Midwest gets substantial rain this week.
   ``There's a need to do something. It would probably take
legislation to do that, and there's a need to do it with some
urgency,'' Lyng said. He also said there is a good chance President
Reagan will give his approval to such a measure.
   ``I'm confident that he has enough compassion that if we can get
a bill that is reasonable and is compassionate and helpful to the
farmers that the president will accept it,'' Lyng said.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, chairman of the meeting, said
governors and lawmakers had reached tentative agreement with Lyng
on some basic outlines of legislation.
   Under the blueprint, he said, the legislation should be
evenhanded toward farmers whose crops are covered by farm programs
and growers of so-called non-program crops.
   He said it also should not require farmers to refund any part of
their so-called deficiency payments and should distribute among
drought-stricken farmers the money that the government now expects
to save because of the smaller size of the harvest.
   Deficiency payments are income-support payments that represent
the difference between the prices that farmers get for their crops
at market and target prices that are set by Congress and adjusted
annually by the secretary of agriculture.
   The expected smaller harvest has driven up prices and thus
narrowed the gap between the market and target-price levels. This
translates into smaller deficiency payments and a resulting major
savings for the government from the $17 billion it has budgeted for
farm subsidies.
   But the increase in market prices comes while some crops are
being wiped out, leaving farmers with nothing to take to market.
   To complicate matters, 40 percent of these deficiency payments
have been sent to farmers in advance. Since the amount of the
payment also is based on the projected size of the harvest, some
farmers might have to refund a portion of what they already have
received.
   ``I think it would be very difficult to collect advance
deficiency payments from farmers who have no income,'' Lyng said.
   Sinner urged a bipartisan effort to speed work on the
legislation.
   ``We absolutely must avoid political bargaining over which party
is going to grant the most help to farmers,'' he said. ``We are
going to try desperately to get a consensus on legislation and not
have a lot of bickering within the halls of Congress. Whether we
can do that is a tough question, but we are going to try.''
   Governors warned the drought is worsening.
   ``It's a critical time when the corn is tasseling and we're in
the pollinating stage,'' said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. ``Every day
that goes by we see a substantial reduction in yields.''
   Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri said farmers in his state will
face ``real economic disaster'' unless relief is granted.
   Also on hand were Govs. George Mikelson of South Dakota, Rudolph
Perpich of Minnesota and James Martin of North Carolina. Officials
of seven other states also attended the session.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Trial Date for Feds' Suit Against Teamsters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused a government request
to appoint a watchdog for allegedly corrupt locals of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
   But the judge allowed prosecutors an early trial date for the
massive civil racketeering case.
   U.S. District Judge David Edelstein on Thursday set Feb. 27,
1989 for the government's lawsuit to oust reputed Mafia-dominated
members of the Teamsters' executive board.
   Edelstein also indefinitely continued a temporary restraining
order he issued at the government's request last week and which had
been due to expire Friday. The order barred the executive board
from either making large expenditures of union funds or destroying
union records.
   Federal prosecutors had sought a preliminary injunction that,
among other things, would have created one or more court-appointed
liaison officers to police corruption among the hundreds of locals
in the 1.6 million-member union.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, however, did not see the ruling
as a setback.
   ``The court has extended the temporary restraining order until
the time of the trial and has set the trial schedule on the fast
track that we asked for,'' said Giuliani, whose office brought the
lawsuit last week. ``From our point of view, this achieves almost
everything we wanted to get.''
   Losing the bid for the liaison officers was not problem, said
Giuliani ``since we have a quick trial date.''
   There was no answer at Teamsters headquarters in Washington when
called for comment.
   The liaison officers also would have been empowered to appoint
trustees to run corrupt Teamsters locals and review expenditures
and union constitution changes by the executive board.
   But Teamsters attorney John R. Climaco asked Edelstein earlier
this week to give the union more time to counter ``what we consider
the false and shameful allegations by the government.''
   Edelstein concluded that ``it would clearly be imprudent to
grant the preliminary relief sought by the government without an
evidentiary hearing.''
   But, he added: ``It is apparent that the legal and factual
questions presented by this case require more time to prepare than
the time within which a preliminary injunction hearing would
typically be heard.''
   Instead, Edelstein decided to combine the hearing with the trial
on the government's lawsuit.
   The massive lawsuit claimed mobsters, wielding influence over
the executive board, have deprived union members of their rights
through shootings, bombings, beatings and a ``campaign of fear,
bribes, extortion and theft.''

<HEAD>Dividends Struggle To Keep Up With Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Encouraged by brisk economic activity and strong
earnings growth, corporate America has lately been increasing the
dividends it pays at a stepped-up pace.
   But some Wall Street analysts argue that dividends have not been
growing fast enough to provide much support for a continuing
recovery in the stock market from last year's crash.
   The number of companies raising their dividends in June reached
106 this year, a 19 percent increase from 89 in the June 1987,
according to Standard & Poor's Corp.
   For the first six months of 1988, there were 893 increases,
compared with 863 in the like period last year and 829 in the first
half of 1986.
   Furthermore, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&P's investment
advisory publication The Outlook, the increases this year are
running larger than usual.
   Kaufman estimates that dividends paid by companies represented
in S&P's 500-stock composite index will grow 10 percent in 1988,
for the largest increase in recent years.
   That's all very nice, say some skeptics about stock-market
prospects, but it doesn't look so impressive when you consider the
competition stocks face from interest-bearing investments and the
possibility that the inflation rate might be picking up.
   As of early this month, the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
industrial average had an aggregate yield of 3.5 percent.
   That is substantially higher than the levels below 3 percent
that prevailed last summer, when the market was headed for big
trouble. But it is still low by historical standards.
   A stock-market bull might well argue that dividends are just one
of many factors that influence stock prices, and a relatively minor
force at best. Certainly most stock investors are less
yield-conscious than people who put their money in bonds.
   A case can also be made that anticipation of future growth in
earnings and dividends can justify a relatively low current yield.
   Still, dividend yield has long been used as one primary
yardstick to measure whether stocks are cheap, fairly priced or
``overvalued.''
   And, of course, dividends are a component of the total return
professional money managers look for from their portfolios.
   In theory at least, stocks must pay their holders a premium in
their combined capital gains and dividends over the interest
payments available on high-grade bonds. Otherwise, why take the
extra risk that comes with stock investments.
   As reported in Barron's magazine, the interest yield on
top-grade corporate bonds stood recently at 9.44 percent _ 5.94
percentage points above the stock yield.
   That left the so-called stock-bond yield spread not very much
narrower than the gap of 6.43 percentage points that existed a year
ago.
   No single indicator like comparative yields can provide any
sure-fire answer to the future course of stock prices. However, the
pessimists warn that current stock yields don't provide much of a
cushion should inflation increase, interest rates go higher, or
both.
   The greater the stock-bond yield spread, they point out, the
more stocks would have to rise in price just to match the more
certain return available from bond interest payments.
   How to shrink the stock-bond spread? A decline in stock prices
would be one way. A lot of investors would prefer to see it
accomplished less painfully, perhaps by a combination of falling
interest rates and a continued rise in dividends.

   The stock market was widely mixed today, faced
with news of unexpectedly strong employment growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .18 to 2,122.87
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 301 up, 635
down and 470 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.15 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point
last month, to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   Nonfarm payroll employment, a figure watched especially closely
on Wall Street, increased by 346,000. That substantially exceeded
advance estimates in the financial community.
   While the news had many positive aspects, it also served as fuel
for recent fears among investors that inflation and interest rates
might rise as the economy heats up.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value after the employment report was made public.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose \ to 127~; Allied-Signal gained [ to 35{; General
Electric was unchanged at 44[, and Ford Motor dropped [ to 53].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.17 to 153.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .42 at 308.53.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.47 to
2,122.69.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 568 up, 845 down and 536 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 156.10 million shares, against 189.63 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Warner Ordered To Pay $22.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Marvin Warner was stunned
by a jury verdict requiring him to pay $22.6 million for
fraudulently removing money from a failing securities dealer, while
his attorney challenged the jury's competence to decide the complex
case.
   But Thomas Tew, bankruptcy trustee for the failed ESM Government
Securities, hailed Thursday's verdict in his civil suit against
Warner as ``a slam dunk.''
   The six-member federal jury was asked to decide 22 questions as
Tew accused Warner of fraudulently withdrawing money from ESM when
he knew the firm was in dire financial trouble. Tew also charged
Warner with profiting from insider information and loaning ESM
money in exchange for profits on bogus financial transactions.
   ``We had to get 19 questions answered our way before we got a
penny, and they only had to get three questions answered their way
to win across the board,'' Tew said. ``But we got 22 out of 22
right. It was a slam dunk.''
   ESM failed in 1985 with $315 million in losses. Warner's
Cincinnati-based thrift, Home State Savings Bank, was ESM's biggest
customer and collapsed days later, triggering a savings and loan
panic in Ohio.
   Warner, 69, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland who now
lives on an Ocala horse ranch, promised an appeal. He was visibly
upset when he heard the verdict and said: ``I'm stunned. Terribly.''
   Last year, Warner was acquitted of federal criminal charges but
convicted of state charges in Ohio and sentenced to three years in
connection with Home State's collapse. He is free while appealing
that conviction.
   Warner's attorney, Andrew Hall, said Thursday's verdict was
``clearly a decision based on court passion. Clearly the jury did
not understand what this case was about.''
   The lawsuit claimed Warner violated securities, racketeering and
civil theft statutes to unjustly profit from ESM's failure.
   Warner won a strategic victory on the final day of testimony
when U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. ruled the plaintiff had
not proven Warner was involved in securities fraud.
   Before the verdict, Warner said, ``Regardless of the financial
outcome, what that judge did vindicated me.''
   But the jury found that Warner ``actually participated in the
fraudulent purpose'' of ESM.
   He held a personal account at ESM and encouraged Home State to
invest with the obscure Fort Lauderdale firm.
   Tew's lawyers claimed Warner was an insider at ESM who demanded
and was given special treatment because of Home State's huge
investments.
   But Hall depicted Warner as ``the largest single victim of ESM's
fraud. ... If you are a victim, how can you be an insider.''
   Tew has charged that Warner, who filed for reorganization under
federal bankruptcy laws, has placed his fortune in his family's
name to protect his funds from court-ordered penalties.

   Northwest Airlines wants to know what people
think of the beleaguered airline, so it's hired a consulting firm
to survey customers, employees and shareholders, a newspaper said
today.
   The Detroit News said it had obtained an internal Northwest memo
dated July 1 asking employees to share with management their
perception of the airline's identity, including ``the red tail, the
airline's name and logo and their reaction to changing these
identity elements.''
   Northwest spokesman Alan Muncaster said such surveys are
routine, that the airline is only evaluating its visual image.
   ``The Northwest logo and colors, or many of those elements, have
been around a long, long time,'' he said. ``We want to assure
ourselves that we're reflecting a contemporary airline, and are we
doing it the right way.''
   Employee questionnaires are due Monday at the San
Francisco-based Landor Associates Inc. Muncaster said results are
expected later this summer.
   ``If there's an overwhelming need to make changes, then, in all
likelihood, we would consider making those changes, but I don't
know when,'' he said.
   Alan Taylor, a senior vice president of Landor, said that in
addition to the employee questionnaires, his company would check
with customers and shareholders of NWA Inc., Northwest's parent
company.
   Taylor said Landor has done similar work for Mercedes-Benz,
General Electric Co., Coca-Cola Co. and about 30 other airlines.
   During the past couple of years, Northwest has weathered labor
problems, disappointing on-time statistics and increased consumer
complaints. Last August, Northwest Flight 255 crashed on takeoff
from Detroit, killing 156 people. The company was criticized on
several fronts for refusing to release a passenger list from that
crash.

   Coming down the rural road off Pitcher
Mountain onto state Route 10 into Marlow, population 551, PC
Connection is easy to find, but hard to believe.
   What is one of the nation's fastest-growing companies _ purveyor
of mail-order computer software and accessories _ doing in a place
like this?
   The general store, Vic's Lunch and the statue of a soldier in
the center of town are within walking distance. Employees can fish
_ in season, of course _ on their lunch hour in the Ashuelot River
running alongside the modest, two-story frame building. The worst
traffic comes from mosquitoes and black flies.
   Far away are the glitzy, high-tech worlds of Silicon Valley in
California and Route 128 outside Boston.
   But to hear Pat Gallup talk, rural New Hampshire is the perfect
setting for a company with a raccoon for a logo, a historian on the
staff and 18,000 corporate accounts. And why should anyone be
surprised that at age 34, with a background in archeology, she is
president of a company that grossed $60 million in 1986, and an
estimated $100 million in 1987.
   Gallup and David Hall, 39, co-founder and chief executive
officer, were in the right place at the right time with the right
idea when they started PC Connection in 1982 and grossed $233,000.
   ``We were the first to specialize in PC products and service,''
Gallup said.
   Receipts reached $8 million in 1983 and have kept growing.
   Last December, Inc Magazine listed PC Connection as the second
fastest-growing firm in the country in 1986. Also last December, a
PC Magazine survey of companies and individuals making mail-order
purchases gave PC Connection better ratings for service, prices and
reputation than any other mail-order company.
   For example, salespeople handling telephones are all college
graduates working on salary _ no commission, no pressure selling _
and all are trained to understand the products, Gallup says.
   Order a product from PC Connection before 8 p.m. and it will
arrive the next day. The shipping charge is $3 regardless of
destination.
   And with every hard disk drive, the customer gets a 90-minute
videotape with 15 minutes of instruction, 75 minutes blank. ``We
tell them to erase the tape when they're finished and use it for a
movie,'' Gallup said.
   Peter Haas, director of customer affairs, has been with the
company for five years. He says many of the company's ideas are
based on bad experiences with other companies.
   ``A lot of our competitors think price alone and sell short on
service,'' Haas said.
   The emphasis on detail is expensive, he says, but it pays off in
reorders from satisfied customers.
   The company's distinctive tastes extend to its physical plant.
In addition to expanding its 50,000-square-foot headquarters at a
cost of $500,000, the company has undertaken a $1 million
renovation of the historic, 155-year-old Christmas Tree Inn across
Route 10 and has invested $1.5 million in a video studio in Newport.
   When it opens next year, the inn will be a retail showroom and a
training facility for businesses to acquaint themselves with PC
Connection products. The studio will produce videos that can be
transmitted by satellite directly to corporations for training.
   Neither studio nor inn are expected to produce revenue; instead,
they are designed to enhance product support for PC Connection
customers.
   With her interest in archeology, Gallup hired a historian to
make certain that renovations to the 13,000-square-foot Victorian
inn conform with the way the inn looked at the turn of the century.
   All these unusual undertakings started with a chance meeting of
two backpackers at Bishbash Falls on the Appalachian Trail in 1975.
Gallup, of Mansfield, Conn., was at the University of Connecticut.
Hall, a chemical engineering major from the University of New
Hampshire whose family moved from New York to Gilsum, N.H., in the
1960s, was working in the family business making broadcasting and
recording equipment.
   Gallup worked in archeology for a few years after college before
Hall persuaded her to come to Gilsum to work in personnel, public
relations and advertising in the audio shop, which was moved to
Marlow in 1980.
   They got interested in personal computers, but had difficulty
getting up-to-date information in the fast-growing industry.
   ``We saw the need to put all the information and the product in
one place,'' Gallup said.
   Operating out of the audio shop, they started up in 1982 needing
only some phone lines and United Parcel Service. The biggest
expense was advertising _ one-ninth of a page in Byte magazine in
February 1982.
   ``The phone didn't ring for three days, and we sat looking at
each other,'' Gallup recalled. Then it started, and never stopped.
   ``We did everything _ took calls, placed orders, packed boxes.
When we were in business a year we knew it would require 100
percent of our attention.''
   They left the audio business to Hall's family, hired eight more
people _ they now employ 185 _ and rented space at the inn. Before
long, the phone company had to upgrade the lines to Keene _ the
largest nearby community _ to carry the extra traffic.
   The company's advertising now stresses its off-the-beaten-track,
Marlow connection.
   ``We play up Marlow in the ads,'' Gallup said. ``We're not just
another company from California, and maybe people feel a little
more comfortable than if we were operating out of a warehouse in
Hoboken.''
   While Marlow provides PC Connection with a New England heritage,
the company has provided the town with jobs, taxes and a $6,000
computer system for town records and the school. And when the
wooden flagpole blew over, the company gave the town a new
fiberglass one.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybeans Open Mixed In Cautious Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed in slow,
cautious trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Many analysts were confused by Thursday's sharp declines in the
face of mostly bullish signals, and traders appeared unwilling to
take a gamble on the weekend weather.
   Scattered showers forecast for Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern
Iowa today were expected to reach Illinois, Indiana and Ohio by
Sunday, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   But the rains were expected to be light, the long-range outlook
remained hot and dry and Lespinasse wasn't making any predictions
about the market's performance.
   ``The market is perplexing,'' he said. ``It's inexplicable why
we went down so hard when there isn't that much rain around and the
temperatures are very hot. Maybe the market knows something we
don't.''
   Some oat futures opened down the 15-cents-a-bushel limit for
daily trading. Corn was lower, soybeans were mixed and wheat was
higher.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 4{ cents higher with July
at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 5\ cents lower to { cent higher with
July at $3.20{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 15 cents lower with
July at $2.98 a bushel; soybeans were 13{ cents lower to 9{ cents
higher with July at $9.44 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August
at 64.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .13
cent higher with August at 74.65 cents a pound; hogs were .80 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with July at 45.55 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to 1 cent lower with July at
33.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

   Oil futures retreated today in the wake of
Thursday's sharp advance that was sparked by confusion over a rig
explosion in the North Sea and speculation over the chances for an
emergency OPEC meeting.
   By midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for
August delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 27 cents
to $15.56 per 42-gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher on
Thursday. The contract had traded as high as $16.35 per barrel
during that session.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange today, unleaded
gasoline was off 0.17 cent a gallon at 52.95 cents after settling
2.56 cents higher on Thursday.
   Home heating oil, which advanced 1.68 cents a gallon to 44.29
cents in the previous session, slipped 0.59 cent to 43.70 cents.
   Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
today's price decline was the result of some profit-taking and a
general correction from Thursday's overbought condition.
   ``It may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today,'' he said.
``I think a lot of people felt it was overdone.''
   On Thursday, the news of an oil rig explosion off the coast of
Scotland ``was the beginning reason for hysteria'' in the oil
futures markets, said John O'Connell, senior energy analyst at
Refco Inc.
   Prices rose sharply as traders reacted to reports that the
explosion would affect about 12 percent of total North Sea
production, or as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
   ``That sounds very, very impressive, but it's really
insignificant _ it's a very small amount of world production,'' and
crude contracts began to ease once traders put the incident into
perspective, O'Connell said.
   Gasoline prices rose sharply following a report by the American
Petroleum Institute late Wednesday that U.S. inventories of
unleaded gasoline declined by 5 million barrels in the previous
week.
   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., attributed the decline to higher consumption coupled with
refinery problems that have reduced production.
   Analysts also said the market had some left-over nervousness
from Wednesday's report that three members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting countries might request an emergency meeting of
the cartel.
   The Kuwaiti news agency quoted unidentified sources as saying
officials from Venezuela, Algeria and Ecuador wanted OPEC to
consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices.
   The report ``continued to be denied, and by late afternoon
(Thursday) these hopes had faded and people were becoming more
realistic,'' O'Connell said.
   Baker said the request for an OPEC meeting ``doesn't have broad
sponsorship at all.
   ``They'll only face the same issues they were unable to resolve
at the last meeting,'' he said, referring to last month's meeting
of the 13-nation cartel in Vienna, Austria, where oil ministers
left the existing system of production quotas and prices intact.
   Most OPEC members are thought to be producing above their
individual quotas or discounting their prices. Some estimates put
OPEC production at 3.5 million barrels above the group's
self-imposed overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day.

   Youths finding a wealth of summertime jobs
dropped the nation's June civilian unemployment rate to 5.3
percent, its lowest since 1974, the government said today.
   President Reagan called the news ``solid evidence'' that his
economic policies have succeeded.
   Seasonally adjusted employment in June jumped by 820,000 _ 75
percent of it among youths 16-24 years old _ to more than offset
May's decline of 536,000.
   The 0.3 percentage point improvement in the unemployment rate
marked the first time the rate has dipped so strongly since 1986
and sent it to its lowest since joblessness stood at 5.1 percent in
May 1974.
   Unemployment among teenagers fell 2.0 percentage points to 13.6
percent, its lowest since 1970.
   Among black teens, the rate fell a whopping 6.0 percent to 28.4
percent, the lowest recorded since that statistic was first tracked
in 1972. Black teenage employment, however, was still more than
double the 12.0 percent rate for white teens.
   Analysts had anticipated a surge in youth employment in the
tourism industry as unprecedented numbers of foreigners, buoyed by
the devalued dollar, are vacationing in the United States this
summer.
   Reagan appeared before reporters at his spokesman's daily
meeting with reporters to applaud the labor force report and to put
in a thinly veiled plug for Vice President George Bush.
   ``Today's news is more solid evidence that the policies of this
administration work, that our philosophy works,'' the president
said. ``I predict that 1988 will be a banner year for Republicans
because it's a banner year for peace and prosperity in America.''
   ``More Americans are working today than ever before in our
history,'' he said. ``As they sit around their kitchen tables, more
Americans are planning for their future, not desperately searching
the want ads for a job.''
   The Labor Department said the June job growth was affected in
part by the fact that its monthly household survey was conducted
late in June, ``allowing extra time for students, graduates and
seasonal workers to find jobs.''
   The hiring boom meant that 62.3 percent of working-age Americans
had jobs, a percentage achieved only in April.
   Unemployment dropped by 328,000 to 6.5 million last month, with
teenagers and adult men accounting for all of the decline.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed that 345,000 jobs
were created in June, compared with an average of 250,000 a month
from February through May. The largest increases were in services
and retail trade, 160,000 and 75,000 respectively.
   The Labor Department said there were also ``noteworthy'' gains
of 25,000 jobs each in transportation and wholesale trade,
reflecting increased factory output.
   After slowing in May, employment in the goods-producing areas of
the economy resumed its vigorous growth of the last year.
Construction employment rose by 55,000 jobs; factory employment
grew by 45,000.
   Most of the factory gains were in the machinery and
durable-goods areas.
   The active housing market sent employment in the finance,
insurance and real estate industries up by a total of 15,000,
compared with a gain of only 1,000 in May. Employment in those
industries was still 63,000 below the level of a year ago, four
months before the October stock market crash.
   Meanwhile, the number of so-called ``discouraged workers'' _
out-of-work people who have given up the search for a job in the
belief that none exists _ declined by 117,000 to 910,000 in the
April-June quarter.
   The number of people working part-time because they could not
find full-time jobs jumped 470,000 in June to 5.3 million, however.
   A separate unemployment calculation including the 1.7 million
members of the armed services stationed in the United States also
dropped by 0.3 percentage point, to 5.2 percent.
   Unemployment dropped 0.3 percentage point to 4.6 percent among
adult men, but was unchanged at 4.9 percent for adult women and at
9.0 percent for Hispanics. Among whites, joblessness fell from 4.7
percent to 4.5 percent; among blacks, the rate fell from 12.4
percent to 11.5 percent.
   Despite widespread fears that the tight job market might set off
a wage-price spiral, there was no indication of that happening last
month. The average hourly wage, seasonally adjusted, was unchanged
at $9.27 after rising at an annual rate of 6 percent in April and
May. Before the adjustment, hourly earnings fell by 2 cents an hour.

   A heat wave shattered temperature records in the Midwest, baking
already parched crops and prompting a pollution warning in Chicago,
while North Dakota officials said the drought could put 7,000
farmers out of business this year.
   Low water again kept barges from moving today on the lower
Mississippi River and part of the Ohio was closed.
   Thunderstorms dumped heavy rain overnight in western Texas,
including more than 4 inches at Odessa and 3.25 inches at Midland,
the National Weather Service said. The Texas rain caused street
flooding and more than 40 homes in Lea County, N.M., had water
inside, the service said. Windsor, Colo., got more than 3{ inches
of rain.
   But in the Southeast, no such relief is expected for central
North Carolina.
   ``Unless we get a hurricane or a tropical storm, it looks like
we're in for dry conditions right on through September,'' said
Larry Gabrick, a weather service meteorologist at Raleigh-Durham
Airport.
   In Chicago, which hit 97 degrees Thursday, stagnant air and
scorching temperatures helped push ozone concentrations to the
highest level in a decade, state Environmental Protection Agency
officials said.
   ``It just feels heavy on your lungs,'' said A.J. D'Angelo, a
27-year-old attorney, fresh from a workout in a downtown health
club. ``In the gym it wasn't so bad, but just walking around during
the day, it's just horrible.''
   Authorities issued a ``yellow alert,'' warning that
concentrations of the airborne pollutant were so high that the very
old, the very young, and those with respiratory ailments should
stay indoors. Agency spokesman Will Flower said the high levels of
ozone would continue today.
   ``I don't want to breathe this air. I'm not used to this,'' said
Sylvia Milosevic, 33, who moved to Chicago four months ago from Los
Angeles.
   Temperatures hovered near 100 degrees Thursday across much of
Indiana for the third consecutive day. With no rain predicted
through Sunday, officials said the week would likely close as the
hottest and driest this year.
   In Ohio, Columbus, Akron-Canton, Youngstown, Dayton, Findlay,
Zanesville and Mansfield were in the 100s, while Toledo posted 103.
Records were set at seven of the state's nine reporting cities,
forecasters said.
   Minneapolis reached 99 degrees, and the temperature at the
Duluth airport hit 97, breaking a record of 93 for the date set in
1980.
   And for the fourth straight day Thursday, Buffalo, N.Y., set a
record high temperature. The 94-degree reading broke the record of
93 degree set for the date in 1944.
   In North Dakota, as many as 7,000 farmers, most of whom took up
the trade in the last 10 years, could be forced out of the business
because of this year's drought, state Agriculture Commissioner Kent
Jones said.
   ``There's at least that many who are in real trouble,'' Jones
said Thursday. ``A lot of them are young farmers who got started in
the late 70s.''
   The estimate represents 22 percent of the state's 31,000 farmers.
   The Mississippi River remained closed to barge traffic at Black
Hills, Miss., about 20 miles south of Natchez, Miss., where water
had been as low as five feet.
   The Ohio River was closed periodically today off Mound City,
Ill., to allow crews to dredge sand and silt, Coast Guard Lt. j.g.
Jim Clifton said at Paducah, Ky.
   Authorities planned to open the channel for six hours, then
close it for 12 hours for dredging, for several days, Clifton said.
   ``It will just alternate back and forth like that until they get
it cleared through,'' he said.
   The drought has been deadly for many crops in Illinois.
   State Agriculture Director Larry Werries estimated that the
average corn yield of 119 bushels per acre had been cut in half by
the beginning of the week, and was dropping at a rate of 5 percent
a day.
   At that rate, a farmer with 500 acres of drought-stressed corn
would lose about $10,000 a day at current grain prices.
   ``By the weekend, we will have some farmers saying it's all over
_ and they'll be correct,'' said University of Illinois agronomist
Emerson Nafziger. ``I think it's safe to say there are going to be
fields with no yield at all.''

   The stock market showed a small loss today,
faced with news of unexpectedly strong employment growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.56 to 2,119.13
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 537 up, 700 down and
552 unchanged.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point
last month, to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   Nonfarm payroll employment, a figure watched especially closely
on Wall Street, increased by 346,000. That substantially exceeded
advance estimates in the financial community.
   While the news had many positive aspects, it also served as fuel
for recent fears among investors that inflation and interest rates
might rise as the economy heats up.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value after the employment report was made public.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose ~ to 85~;
General Electric was unchanged at 44[, and International Business
Machines dropped { to 127[.
   Occidental Petroleum, also among the volume leaders, dropped [
to 26[. The company has said it expects no change in its dividend
policy resulting from the explosion this week at an oil rig it owns

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.16 to 153.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .04 at 308.91.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.55 million shares at

   The European Economic Community
announced Friday a provisional dumping duty on Japanese daisy-wheel
computer printers.
   The action follows the decision in late May to slap a similar
duty on the makers of dot matrix printers, the other major category
of computer printers.
   According to Friday's announcement by the European Commission, a
duty of 43.2 percent will be imposed on the daisy-wheel printers
made by all companies except Tokyo Electric Co. Ltd. and Tokyo Juki
Industrial Co. Ltd., whose printers will be taxed at a lower rate
of 12.4 percent.
   These rates compare with a duty of 33.4 percent charged on dot
matrix printers made by seven companies and duties ranging from 4.8
to 22.4 percent on eight others.

<HEAD>Look Out Bond Market! Today's Yuppies May Be Tomorrow's Savers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The free-spending yuppies of today have been
blamed for a number of life's little economic inconveniences, like
driving up the prices of vacation homes or sportscars. Even
hoarding imported pesto sauce and brie.
   In the next five years, they also may be partly responsible for
a shortage of bonds that at least one noted economist is
forecasting.
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, predicts that new demographic trends in this
country will dampen the growth of credit demands, and,
consequently, the supply of bonds and notes.
   Today's yuppies, he says, are likely to become tomorrow's
``couch-potato savers,'' with a penchant for stashing away their
cash, possibly in fixed-income investments, instead of borrowing to
finance new homes, expensive BMWs and such.
   ``What is transforming yuppie borrowers into couch-potato
savers? Babies!'' Yardeni says in a recent report. ``Baby boomers,
who are expecting either their first or second baby, tend to borrow
a great deal of money to buy a house. But once they settle down,
odds are they'll borrow less and save more.''
   Yardeni predicts that those who do borrow either may be
renovating an existing home or seeking a larger tradeup, both of
which probably would require less mortgage credit than a first-time
buyer.
   He says that as a result, popular mortgage-backed securities,
such as Ginnie Maes, might shrink in supply. And yields on such
long-term bonds, now in the 10-percent range, could fall to 6
percent in about five years as demand outpaces supply. A drop in
yields will push up the price of existing bonds that carry higher
rates.
   But that's only part of Yardeni's theory. He paints an equally
rosy picture for the rest of the credit markets, particularly
Treasury securities.
   For one thing, he says, chances are the federal budget deficit
will be declining, lessening the supply of bonds.
   Also, savings institutions are likely to increase their
purchases of fixed-income instruments as a result of an anticipated
greater deposit flow from these ``couch-potato savers,'' Yardeni
says. And government trust funds such as Social Security are
expected to run a big surplus in the next few years, ``which could
swallow up the entire national debt by the year 2030,'' he says.
   Yardeni says the yield on the government's bellwether 30-year
bond could fall to 5 percent in five years.
   ``We wouldn't be surprised if, by the end of the decade,
investors complain about a shortage of bonds and nostagically
recall the days when yields were above 9 percent,'' he says.
   But Yardeni warns, ``This is just one component of an overall
view of the economy.
   ``Clearly the fatal blow to my theory would be a severe
recession. It would balloon the federal deficit and cause problems
in the credit markets ... Interest rates would fall but for the
wrong reasons.''

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange jumped Friday,
helped by bullish news on the U.S. economy and renewed strength in
the dollar.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 21.7
points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,877.2.
   Trading volume was a strong 598 million shares, compared with
500.2 million shares traded Thursday.
   Stock prices in London were resilient after a strong U.S.
employment report pointed to a more buoyant economy than previously
thought.
   The government said the U.S. civilian unemployment rate dropped
0.3 percentage point to 5.3 percent in June.
   Analysts also said the dollar's rise in foreign exchange trading
supported stock prices in London.

   The stock market gave ground today, faced with
news of unexpectedly strong employment growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 8.54 to 2,114.15
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally

   Nonfarm payroll employment, a figure watched especially closely
on Wall Street, increased by 346,000. That substantially exceeded
advance estimates in the financial community.
   While the news had many positive aspects, it also served as fuel
for recent fears among investors that inflation and interest rates
might rise as the economy heats up.

<HEAD>European Parliament Calls for Action to Ease Airport Delays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Parliament has urged
quick action by European Economic Community executives to resolve
what it called a worsening problem of flight delays and airliner
near-misses.
   Among the parliament's recommendations was that Eurocontrol, the
10-nation body which monitors flights in Western Europe, be made
part of the EEC, which currently has no formal authority in this
area.
   Airline traffic in Western Europe has grown much faster than
expected in recent years, and a resolution adopted by the
parliament late Thursday said traffic growth is likely to
accelerate as the EEC deregulates the commercial airline industry
in the next several years.
   The resolution said over-congested airspace and limited airport
capacity had led to delays ``not only causing major inconvenience
to passengers but also reducing safety.''
   The parliamentarians sharply criticized both the EEC executive
Commission and national civil aviation authorities for a ``lack of
will'' to create a single system for air traffic control for the
12-nation trading bloc.
   Many of the flight delays result from the fact that 11 different
air traffic-control centers in the EEC are equipped with
incompatible computers, the resolution said.
   George Anastassopoulos, chairman of the parliament's transport
committee, told a news conference that ``the skies cannot be
divided'' in this way. He noted that the EEC planned to dismantle
all barriers to the free movement of people, goods, services and
capital by the end of 1992.
   He blamed the problem on ``misplaced sensitivities about
sovereignty,'' citing Britain and unspecified Scandinavian
countries as notable culprits.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. said Friday it had
signed an agreement in principle to sell its Loehmann's specialty
store chain to a group of investors.
   The group is led by Sefinco Ltd., an affiliate of Entrecanales y
Tavora, an international construction and engineering company based
in Madrid and by the Sprout Group, a division of Donaldson, Lufkin
& Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   Loehmann's is a specialty store chain featuring quality
off-price women's apparel. Headquartered in New York, it operates
77 stores in 25 states. It had sales of $334 million in 1987.
   Thomas Tashjian, a retail industry analyst with Seidler Amdec
Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said the sale of Loehmann's was not
a surprise.
   ``It didn't really fit with the rest of the company,'' he said,
adding that May would prefer to concentrate on its larger
divisions, including its department stores and discount stores.
   May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, owns department
stores including Lord & Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's, Foley's and
Famous Barr. Its discount stores include Caldor and Venture.
   Loeshmann's management team will continue to run the business,
according to a news release from May.
   The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of August.

<TEXT>
   A Security and Exchange Commission ruling that
prevents the issuing of separate and more powerful classes of stock
does not seriously deplete corporate America's defensive armory.
   ``Poison pills'' remain the No. 1 repellant of hostile bidders,
far surpassing ``supervoting'' stock, which carries greater weight
than the average common share.
   Indeed, only 359 public companies have unequal voting rights,
while at least half of the Fortune 500 firms have adopted poison
pills designed to make unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive.
   After nearly two years of debate, the SEC on Thursday upheld the
``one share, one vote rule'' _ with a trail of caveats _ in an
effort to preserve the rights of existing shareholders.
   Experts expect the ruling to have little impact. They note that
despite its superior ability to shield a company from hostile
bidders, supervoting stock is difficult to issue.
   For one thing, it had been frowned upon by the New York Stock
Exchange, at times banning the issuing of dual classes of stock and
threatening to delist companies that did so.
   In addition, it almost always requires a shareholder vote to
adopt a second class, and management typically shies from the risk
of rejection, said Robert Kohl, a partner at the law firm of Gaston
& Snow.
   It's hard to advertise to shareholders that diluting their
voting power ultimately is a benefit. Institutional investors also
would be hard to sway because they want to be able to cash in on an
attractive bid, if one happens to come along,noted Stephen Flood, a
partner with the law firm of Willkie, Farr & Gallagher.
   But far deeper is the ethic that ``appeals to our democratic
education about one share, one vote,'' Kohl said.
   Some 60 companies listed on the NYSE have dual classes of stock,
and the SEC left those established structures intact. The
commission also will allow companies that have registered to issue
supervoting stock to proceed with their plans.
   Among the public companies that have dual classes are Ford Motor
Co., Hershey Foods Corp., Wm. Wrigley & Co., General Motors Corp.
and a number of media companies, including Dow Jones & Co., New
York Times Co., Washington Post Co. and Media General Inc.
   Kohl said the dual-class structure is most common among
companies ``that have long-standing family control or foundation
control that they want to maintain.''
   For example, Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan and his
family own 71 percent of the company's Class B shares, which
control six of the nine seats on the company's board. The Bryan
family had little trouble in quashing California investor Burt
Sugarman in a recent proxy contest for three seats on Media
General's board.
   And in the case of Resorts International Inc., ``Donald Trump
had about 7 or 9 percent of the equity, but he controled 70 percent
of the vote,'' Flood noted. ``That is the best defense, and in a
way the cheapest one.''
   Entertainer Merv Griffin paid Trump $195 million for his Class B
Resorts shares, each of which carried 100 times the voting power of
a Class A share.
   Keeping control in the hands of a founding family can have
certain benefits, ``though they're not readily apparent and have to
overcome the presumption of being democratic,'' Kohl said.
   For one thing, continued founding family control can ensure
stability, especially if the family has a large financial stake in
the company. ``You can assume it will protect that stake, and that
will protect the rest of the shareholders,'' Kohl said.
   Also, management can engage in ``longer term planning which may
involve current financial sacrifice without fear of being thrown
out,'' he added.
   The counter argument, of course, is that incompetent management
can be protected.
   It is the poison pill, however, that has been the mainstay of
corporate defensive tactics. Pills not enacted during a tender
offer generally have been upheld in the courts, Kohl said, while
there has been varying success when adopted during an offer.
   Part of their popularity with managers may be that the pills are
easy to enact _ they generally do not require shareholder approval.
   The SEC ruling also does not pre-empt anti-takeover legislation
adopted by individual states. Thus, a company could reincorporate
in a state whose laws affect the voting rights of shareholders.
   Companies still will be allowed to issue new shares with diluted
voting power, and such shares can be issued during mergers.
Companies going public will be able to issue both strong- and
weaker-voting shares.
   Stocks of foreign companies traded in the United States are
exempt, as are the less actively traded issues of small companies
listed in the National Association of Securities Dealers' ``pink
sheets.''

<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybeans futures prices closed
sharply lower for the second consecutive session Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, stumping many analysts who saw mostly
bullish signs ahead.
   Some corn contracts and most oat contracts fell their
15-cents-a-bushel limit for daily trading, and the contract for
November delivery of soybeans plunged nearly the 45-cent limit for
that market. Wheat futures were mixed.
   Some private forecasters said chances had improved for weekend
showers in Illinois and Iowa, but chances had fallen for rain in
Indiana and Ohio on the belt's parched eastern edge.
   ``You'd think one would offset the other but it didn't turn out
that way,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   The selling was led by independent traders and hedgers, and may
simply have represented profit-taking ahead of the weekend,
analysts said.
   Many private projections for 1988 corn and soybean production
were released in advance of the Agriculture Department's official
report, which is due on Tuesday. But the estimates varied widely.
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Lespinasse said of the sharp
drop in prices. ``I'm at a loss for words and so are most other
people.''
   At the close, wheat was 5 cents lower to 8{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.80 a bushel; corn was 1{
cents to 15 cents lower with July at $3.09 a bushel; oats were 8
cents to 15 cents lower with July at $2.93 a bushel; soybeans were
42{ cents lower to 7 cents higher with July at $9.24 a bushel.

<HEAD>Americans Boosted Installment Borrowing in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans increased their installment
borrowing at a modest annual rate of 4.6 percent in May, as growth
in consumer credit slowed from the rapid expansion of earlier this
year, the government said Friday
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumers took out $2.42 billion
more in credit than they paid off in May, compared with net growth
of $3.85 billion in April.
   The annual rate of growth in May was well below the 7.3 percent
rate in April and less than half of the 10.7 percent rate for the
first three months of the year. Consumer credit grew 7.2 percent
last year.
   Slow expansion of automobile credit contributed to low overall
growth in May. Borrowing for autos rose by $597 million, an annual
rate of 2.6 percent, compared with 7.8 percent in April and 15.9
percent in March.
   Economists had been expecting a drop in consumer credit in May,
although a less sharp one, because of rising interest rates during
the month and previously reported weak sales.
   Michael Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said
the May credit report represented a temporary lull from faster
expansion rather than a trend.
   ``May was a bad month for consumer spending. My theory is first
we had a rise in interest rates and secondly we had fewer tax
refunds than usual. Often people use their tax refunds as a down
payment for some big ticket item and that means more credit,'' he
said.
   ``Interest rates eased in June, but a lot of people in May
thought they were going a lot higher and lot of people who had
variable rate mortages thought they were really going to get socked
and took it easier on their other credit,'' he said.
   Consumer spending rebounded in June. Major department stores
Thursday all reported gains. Auto sales for the month jumped from
an annual rate of 10.2 million units to 10.6 million.
   In May, the category that included credit card debt continued a
string of strong increases, rising by $1.69 billion, a 12.1 percent
annual rate, compared with rates of 12.4 percent in April and 16.0
percent in March.
   The credit report said the category that includes bank and
credit union loans not secured by real estate grew by $196 million,
a 1.5 percent rise, compared with a 2.2 percent increase in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes fell $60 million, 2.8 percent, after
a 1.5 percent rise in April.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $631.8 billion
at the end of May, up 9.4 percent from a year ago.

<HEAD>Restructuring Plan Increasing USG Debt Four-Fold Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restructuring plan that will increase USG
Corp.'s debt four-fold _ the legacy of the company's costly victory
in a takeover battle with Desert Partners L.P. _ was overwhelmingly
approved Friday by shareholders.
   Approval by 94 percent of the shareholders who cast votes
``indicates support for USG's continued existence as an independent
company run by current management,'' Chairman Robert Day said after
balloting was complete.
   A total of 51.8 million shares _ 70 percent of the outstanding
stock _ was represented in the vote.
   The restructuring plan, made necessary when the Chicago-based
building supply conglomerate's management rebuffed a takeover bid
by Desert Partners of Midland, Texas, will boost the company's debt
load to $3.1 billion from $800 million.
   Under the plan, shareholders of record by next Tuesday will be
entitled to $37 in cash, $5 in securities and one new share of
common stock for each common share they currently own.
   ``USG has historically carried a modest level of debt, and while
that is our preference, present circumstances require that we
provide an immediate return to shareholders,'' said Day. ``We
intend to reduce our debt load as rapidly as possible and are in a
strong position to do so.''
   Virtually all of the 20-minute comment period Friday on motions
affecting shareholders was devoted to the recapitalization.
   ``Many said they'd made a lot of money in the past and were
happy with the way things were,'' said Thomas Sleeter, manager of
investor relations. ``They didn't wany anybody to tamper.''
   The company's stock price had doubled over the past five years,
and was trading above $50 per share before October's market crash.
When Desert Partners launched its $42-per-share offer in March, USG
was trading below $30.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USG was up 62{ cents
a share at $49 by late afternoon.
   Day and USG's current management won the bitter, protracted
takeover battle, but he acknowledged in an interview Thursday that
the price was a recapitalization that will inhibit USG's growth and
restrict its resources for several years.
   ``There are no winners in this. We're going into very heavy
leverage, and that has its negatives,'' Day said Thursday. ``We
don't feel we lost, but the whole process isn't one that gives us a
great deal of satisfaction, either.''
   As a result of the restructuring, an unspecified number of jobs
will be lost. Already, the work force has been cut 9 percent this
year, Day said.
   Two companies will be sold, reversing a trend that saw USG
acquire five companies in 1987.
   ``It will restrict our ability to pay dividends, to commit
capital to capital investments, and reduce our research and
development program. And these latter two, in particular, are the
things which provide growth for the future,'' Day said.
   He said the recapitalization was the only why to satisfy USG's
loyal, long-term investors and the newcomers who moved in on the
heels of Desert Partners.
   But he admitted he regrets the restructuring was necessary.
   ``I'm not bitter, but I am sorry,'' Day said. ``It's been very
costly, disruptive and demoralizing. So it's pretty hard to find
anything to feel good about.''

<HEAD>Louisiana To Offer Sales Tax Rebates to Foreign Tourists</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to UPDATE with bill signed. Also moving on

<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana is becoming the first state to
give sales tax rebates to foreign visitors, a move designed to
boost the tourism industry and create jobs in a state plagued by
double-digit unemployment.
   The state will join 17 European countries that offer similar
refunds under a bill Gov. Buddy Roemer signed into law Friday.
   ``I think it is a fantastic concept for us in that we are the
first in the nation to do it,'' said Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy, who
serves as the head of Louisiana's Department of Culture, Recreation
and Tourism.
   The program, which the state hopes to implement in early 1989,
will offer the rebates only for retail sales. Hotel bills, rental
cars and restaurant and bar tabs will not be affected.
   ``While we're rebating only the tax on shopping, we will get
more (visitors) paying the sales tax on everything else,'' said
Eugene Schrieber, managing director of the World Trade Center in
New Orleans.
   According to a World Trade Center study, 301,000 foreign
tourists from countries other than Mexico and Canada visited
Louisiana in 1986 to take in such attractions as New Orleans'
French Quarter, pre-Civil War plantation mansions in southern
Louisiana and the Cajun country.
   During that year, Louisiana attracted 3.4 percent of overseas
tourists who came to the United States, ranking it 15th among the
states.
   ``I don't think Louisiana is getting its fair share,'' said
Hardy, who campaigned last fall on the theme of building the
state's tourism industry.
   Schrieber said the state will make up for the lost sales tax
revenue on retail purchases when tourism increases by 12 percent.
   Backers believe the program will boost tourism by 26 percent,
which would create 1,200 new jobs, hike payrolls by $12 million and
give the state a $2.2 million revenue increase after the tax
rebates, Schrieber said.
   Louisiana's unemployment rate, which was 10.6 percent in May,
has been in double digits since the collapse of oil and gas prices
in the early 1980s.
   Schrieber said Louisiana is moving at the right time to
implement the program since the value of the dollar is low against
other currencies, making American goods cheaper for foreign
tourists.
   ``You have a tremendous influx of tourists coming into the
United States,'' he said. ``This is the perfect time to do this.''
   Durng 1986, California had 3 million foreign tourists, not
counting visitors from Mexico, Florida had 1.8 million and New York
courted 2.2 million, Schrieber said.
   ``We could be getting a lot more foreign visitors,'' he said.
``The growth potential is tremendous.''
   Under the new law, retailers who opt to participate in the
program will pay an annual $100 fee to be listed in a tax-free
shopping guide given to foreign tourists.
   A foreign tourist buying an item in a participating store will
show a passport and a roundtrip airline ticket, indicating his stay
is less than three months, and receive a refund form from the
retailer. The refund will be obtained at a Louisiana airport or by
mail.
   During legislative debate, some lawmakers questioned the wisdom
of offering the rebate at the same time they were imposing a 2-cent
sales tax hike on food, motor fuel and utilities in an effort to
balance the state budget.
   ``I haven't been here for 40 years making these types of
mistakes,'' said state Sen. B.B. ``Sixty'' Rayburn, dean of the
Legislature.
   But state Sen. Bill McLeod compared the rebate to ``loss
leaders'' that grocery stores use to attract customers.
   ``They (tourists) will save a pittance and leave a lot,'' he
said.
   Schrieber said that while foreigners will not flock to Louisiana
merely to take advantage of the refund, the program will provide
more visibility for the state's tourist attractions.
   ``It has a tremendous potential for publicity and promotion,''
he said. ``If it's working for them over there, why wouldn't it
work now?''

   The stock market drifted lower today, faced with
news of unexpectedly strong employment growth.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point
last month, to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   Nonfarm payroll employment, a figure watched especially closely
on Wall Street, increased by 346,000. That substantially exceeded
advance estimates in the financial community.
   While the news had many positive aspects, it also served as fuel
for recent fears among investors that inflation and interest rates
might rise as the economy heats up.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value after the employment report was made public.

   Stock prices declined in light trading Friday,
faced with news of unexpectedly strong employment growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.54 to
2,106.15, bringing its loss for the week to 25.43 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
563 up, 847 down and 541 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.07 million
shares, down from 156.10 million Thursday and the smallest total
since a 116.75 million-share day on June 20.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 158.13 million shares.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point
last month, to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   Nonfarm payroll employment, a figure watched especially closely
on Wall Street, increased by 346,000. That substantially exceeded
advance estimates in the financial community.
   While the news had many positive aspects, it also served as fuel
for recent fears among investors that inflation and interest rates
might rise as the economy heats up.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell about $10 for each
$1,000 in face value after the employment report was made public.
   Losers in the blue-chip sector included General Electric, down ~
at 43\; International Business Machines, down 1\ at 126]; Dow
Chemical, down 1} at 87}; Procter & Gamble, down 1\ at 75\, and
Coca-Cola, down | at 36~.
   But Alcoa, which raised its quarterly dividend from 30 cents to
35 cents a share, gained 1[ to 52}.
   Florida Steel jumped 3| to 47. The company said its top
management was considering a leveraged buyout at a price of
``mid-to-high $40s per share.''
   Genrad Inc. was the biggest percentage loser among NYSE issues,
down 1~ at 9|. The company said it expects to report earnings in
the range of five to seven cents a share for the second quarter,
less than some analysts had been estimating.
   Occidental Petroleum was steady at 26\ in active trading. The
company has said it expects no change in its dividend policy
resulting from the explosion this week at an oil rig it owns in the
North Sea.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   The Federal Reserve Board on Friday gave the
Bank of New York Co. another 60-day extension to persue its hostile
bid for rival Irving Bank Corp., but the regulators also expressed
uneasiness the takeover attempt has entered its 10th month.
   The Fed indicated it was concerned about the costs associated
with the long-standing battle and urged both parties to bring it to
a prompt conclusion.
   ``It is the expressed desire of the board that the parties avoid
further delay and take all steps necessary to bring the pending
proceedings to a prompt conclusion,'' the Fed said in approving
Bank of New York's request for an extension.
   The Fed's extension until Sept. 7 was the second for the Bank of
New York since regulators gave the company conditional approval to
proceed with its takeover plans in February. The first extension
was scheduled to run out Saturday.
   Bank of New York first announced its merger proposal in
September, but all subsequent offers have been steadfastly turned
down by Irving.
   Irving management instead favors a friendly merger with the
state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest
bank.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding. The offer is
valued at around $68 a share, or $1.2 billion.
   The Milan-based Banca Commerciale is offering $80 a share for 51
percent of Irving's outstanding shares and a special $10-a-share
dividend for the remaining 49 percent.
   It recently sweetened the offer to include warrants entitling
shareholders to buy newly issued Irving stock at $65 a share over
the next seven years. Stockholders would receive one warrant for
every four shares they currently owned.
   Robert A. Falise said Irving was disappointed with the Fed's
decision.
   ``The Federal Reserve Board's action ... is contrary to the best
interest of both banking institutions,'' he said.
   The Fed's decision came two days after a New York state judge
struck down a provison of Irving's anti-takeover ``poison pill''
that was designed to thwart the Bank of New York.

Jeers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A proposal that includes coordinated trading
halts by the nation's two leading financial centers won praise
Friday from big brokers and a key member of the presidential panel
that investigated the October stock crash. But others called the
idea a public-relations ploy that would have little practical value
and could actually worsen any possible future panic in the stock
and futures markets.
   The reactions came a day after the New York Stock Exchange and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced a broad strategy aimed at
raising investor confidence and averting more crashes like the one
that shook the markets on Oct. 19, when the Dow Jones industrial
average fell a record 508 points.
   Their proposal for joint ``circuit breakers'' marked the first
time since the crash that the two biggest domestic financial
exchanges displayed open cooperation and acknowledged they are both
part of one market.
   Intermarket coordination was one of the most important
recommendations made by the Presidential Task Force on Market
Mechanisms, the White House panel that reviewed the causes of the
crash.
   ``I think cooperation among the exchanges is what's needed in a
world of closely inter-related markets,'' said Robert Glauber, a
Harvard University professor and executive director of the
presidential study.
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' he said. ``I think the evidence of
cooperation between the exchanges is a tremendous step forward.''
   Major Wall Street firms also applauded the moves by the Big
Board and the Merc, as the exchanges are known in the securities
industry. Several said they approved of any reform that would
encourage reinvestment in stocks by investors who have been
frightened out of the post-crash market.
   ``We are especially pleased that these two market centers have
agreed to a coordinated approach to the complex issues confronting
all of us,'' Merrill Lynch & Co. said in a statement. Kidder
Peabody & Co. President Max C. Chapman said, ``We endorse all
activity that leads to an improvement of investor confidence in the
markets.''
   There was no reaction from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, one of two federal agencies that must approve the
reforms. SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest said he was reading the
proposals but could not comment further.
   David Gary, spokesman for the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, said: ``We applaud the cooperative effort and we think
it's a good first step. We remain ready to see the specifics of the
program when they submit it to us.''
   Others expressed skepticism about the proposed reforms,
particularly a coordinated one-hour trading halt that could be
triggered by a 250-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
in New York or a 30-point fall in the Standard & Poor's 500 index
futures contract traded in Chicago. Under the proposal, subsequent
drops in these indicators could trigger longer halts.
   ``I may be one of the few people on Wall Street who will tell
you it's wonderful PR work, but it's useless,'' said Jack Barbanel,
a futures expert at Gruntal & Co. in New York. ``It really shuts
down the doors on selling orders and causes huge backups. The
people who can't get in get doubly nervous.''
   If that happened, critics said, people who otherwise might have
held their positions could panic and join the queues of sellers,
waiting for the markets to reopen and causing a repeated pattern of
declines and trading halts.
   ``You're putting in safety valves that have some significant
practical leaks,'' Barbanel said. ``I'm not to crazy about it.''
   Glauber disputed such criticisms. ``The fact is there are going
to be circuit breakers whether you want them or not,'' he said.
``The choice is whether they'll be preplanned or ad hoc. Having
them preplanned will induce less panic than having them ad hoc,
like computer systems failing and telephone lines backing up.
That's what occurred in October.''
   Some market experts had a mixed reaction. A few were upset that
as part of the proposal, the NYSE would drop its ``collar''
restraint on computerized trading of large blocks of stocks and
stock-index futures, a technique known as ``program trading'' that
has been blamed for inciting sudden price swings.
   ``I think the spirit of what they're doing is OK and in the
right direction,'' said Haskel Benishay, professor of managerial
economics at Northwestern University's Kellogg graduate business
school. ``But it gives more leeway to program traders. Now the
bands of non-interference are much higher.''

<HEAD>Guinness, Agache Acquire Stake In Moet-Hennessy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guinness PLC said Friday it will join forces with
a French luxury goods marketer to create a new company to hold a
substantial stake in LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, maker of
champagne and upscale luggage.
   Separately, LVMH will acquire 10 percent of Guinness, a leading
British brewer that also makes Johnnie Walker Scotch Whisky and
Gordon's gin. Both transactions are subject to the approval of
Guinness shareholders.
   Guinness said it will invest a minimum 237 million British
pounds, or about $408 million, for a 40 percent stake in a joint
venture company to be formed along with Financiere Agache Group of
France. The new company will control their joint LVMH holdings.
   Agache, a holding company that controls the Christian Dior,
Christian Lacroix and Celine fashion houses, would retain 60
percent of the joint venture company.
   In a statement issued from its Paris headquarters, LVMH
acknowledged that Guinness and Agache have amassed a 24 percent
stake in the company on a fully diluted basis.
   Guinness said the agreement with LVMH represents a ``natural
progression'' of their existing relationship. Last year the two
companies agreed to set up a series of joint ventures to distribute
their products in the United States, Japan and the Far East.
   Anthony Tennant, Guinness's chief executive, called the
agreement a ``major long-term strategic move. Our new partnership
with Financiere Agache Group is based on our mutual and
complementary interest in the wines, spirits and luxury goods
businesses of LVMH.''
   LVMH produces Moet et Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac as
well as perfumes and luxury leather goods. Guinness did not
indicate how large a stake the joint venture company hoped to build
in LVMH.
   LVMH recently purchased 7.25 million Guinness shares in the open
market and intends eventually to increase its holdings to 12
percent. To that end, Guinness has proposed issuing LVMH 90.8
million Guinness common shares, or about 10 percent, for about 390
million pounds, or $671 million.
   LVMH said the cross-shareholding will ``reinforce the commercial
ties that already exist between the two groups and allow them the
stability that is required for their development.''
   The move puts an end to a week of suspense about the identity of
the purchasers who were behind a surge in LVMH shares in unusually
heavy volume.
   Analysts had speculated that Agache was one of the buyers, in
line with the plans of its chairman, Bernard Arnault, to
consolidate his position in the luxury goods sector through an
agreement with LVMH. Guinness was also thought to be a buyer.
   Some analysts speculated that both companies were able to
acquire their stakes relatively unnoticed because of tension among
senior LVMH officials.
   LVMH hasn't commented on the reported tensions, but bankers have
indicated that conflict arose between Alain Chevalier, who heads
the Moet interests, and Henry Racamier, who runs the Vuitton
operations.
   LVMH was formed in 1987 by the merger of two prominent
family-controlled companies, the baggage, perfume and champagne
distributor Louis Vuitton SA and the champagne, spirits and perfume
company Moet-Hennessy SA.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar jumped Friday as its summer rally
gained fresh support from a report of a bigger-than-expected
decline in the U.S. unemployment rate. Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar reached its highest point since last October against
the British pound, West German mark and Swiss franc. It reached its
highest point since last August against the French franc and
Italian lira.
   Intervention by the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank,
failed to halt the dollar's upward swing. Traders said the U.S.
Federal Reserve also sold dollars, but it was not clear whether the
Fed did so for itself or on behalf of the West Germans.
   Traders said the drop in the June civilian jobless rate to 5.3
percent, its lowest point since 1974, increased prospects that the
Federal Reserve would push up interest rates to keep the economy
from overheating. That would make dollar securities more attractive
to foreign investors.
   In addition, a big rise in manufacturing employment was seen as
an indication that exports remained strong, which could help shrink
the trade deficit and support the dollar.
   But several analysts said the dollar was primed for a rise
anyway because its slight weakness in recent days was taken as a
buying opportunity.
   ``When people want to buy a currency, they find good excuses for
it,'' said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort
Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Once the dollar started upward, traders who had been betting on
its decline were forced to retreat and buy dollars to close out
short positions, said David Lapin, chief currency adviser for
BankAmerica International in New York.
   ``It's a snowballing effect, a game of follow the leader,''
Lapin said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.33 yen to a closing 131.97 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted higher at 133.20 yen. Later in New York, the
dollar rose to 133.29 yen from 132.73 late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7015 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7180 Thursday. The pound
also fell against the dollar in New York, to $1.6996 from $1.7134
late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8415 West German marks, up from
1.8221; 1.5325 Swiss francs, up from 1.5151; 1.2091 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2080; 6.1945 French francs, up from 6.1325; and
1,364.50 Italian lire, up from 1,349.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8378 West German marks, up from 1.8161; 1.5295
Swiss francs, up from 1.5100; 6.1820 French francs, up from 6.1140;
2.0605 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0440; 1,355.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,346.50; and 1.2095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.09 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$441.59 an ounce.
   In Europe, gold prices rose briefly, but then fell back. Gold
finished in London at a late bid price of $438.50 an ounce, down
from Thursday's late bid of $440.25. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $439.50 an ounce, down from $441.00 an ounce late Thursday.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $439 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $438.90 an ounce late
Thursday. At the end of the trading day on the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $439.10 a
troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday's close.
   Silver was quoted in London Friday at a late bid price of $7.01
a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $6.98 an ounce. At New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery closed at $7 a troy
ounce, up from $6.935.

<HEAD>Singer Sells Two Divisions For $570 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Singer Co. announced plans Friday to
sell its vocational and military training divisions to separate
companies for a total of $570 million as part of a previously
disclosed divestment program.
   Integrated Resources Acquisition Inc. will acquire the Education
Division, known as Career Systems Development, for $20 million. The
division, a major operator of Job Corps vocational training centers
for the Department of Labor, is headquartered in Rochester, N.Y.
   CAE Industries Ltd. of Toronto will acquire Singer's Link
Domestic Simulation and Training Systems Division for $550 million.
   The division is the leading supplier of military simulation
systems and training services to the Army, Navy, Air Force and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Its headquarters are in Binghamton, N.Y., but it also has
facilities in Houston; Dallas; Sunnyvale, Calif.; Silver Springs,
Md.; and Alexandria, Va.
   CAE is a publicly traded holding and management company with
seven operating divisions across Canada and one in West Germany. It
is engaged in electronics, aerospace and industrial products
manufacturing and services.
   The Singer divisions are the second and third to be sold since
the company was acquired earlier this year by a partnership headed
by investor Paul A. Bilzerian. In making the acquisition, Bilzerian
said at least part of the company's operations would be divested.
   Ryobi Limited of Tokyo, Japan, announced Tuesday it would buy
Singer's motor products division for $325 million.
   Company officials said they expect the sale of the Education
Division to be completed in August. The closing date for the Link
sale depends on regulatory approvals.
   David H. Race, president and chief executive officer of CAE,
said Link and CAE ``are the ideal fit.'' He said CAE intends to
operate Link as an autonomous business unit in its present form.
   ``The combination of technical, manufacturing and financial
resources resulting from this agreement will enhance the ability of
both CAE and Link to serve their customers,'' he said in a joint
statement with Bilzerian.
   Both companies develop and design simulation systems for
fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters and share expertise in
shipboard machinery control systems, nuclear submarine simulators
and control systems for utilities.
   A total of 7,500 people work for Link, which has annual revenues
of approximately $550 million. CAE employes 4,200 people and had
revenues of $283 million for the fiscal year ended March 31.

<HEAD>Florida Steel Managers Considering Making Leveraged Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Steel Corp. said Friday that its top
executives are considering making an offer to take the company
private in a leveraged buyout that would be worth about $270
million or more.
   The company said it had been advised that senior managers were
considering making an offer that would give shareholders cash and
securities ``with terms designed to have an aggregate value
approximately in the mid-to-high forties per share.'' The company
has about 6 million shares outstanding.
   But the statement added that, ``There can be no assurance that
any proposal will be made or, if made, will be accepted'' and the
company added that its board ``has not determined to sell the
company.''
   In a leveraged buyout, those making the acquisition usually
borrow heavily against the target company's profits or assets.
   Alfred Gres, Florida Steel vice president and chief financial
officer, pointed out in an interview that an offer at $45 per share
would make the value of the deal about $270 million.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Florida Steel rose
$3.62{ a share to $47.
   Gres said he and five other executives, including Chairman
Edward L. Flom, were in the group which is considering a buyout. He
said he did not know when they would decide on whether to make a
buyout offer, but said before any deal could be completed, it would
be reviewed by a committee of outside directors.
   ``Since the management group is considering the buyout, I can't
be specific on any date,'' he said.
   Gres said the other Florida Steel executives considering the
buyout are Flom; chief operating officer Thomas Creed; R.R.
Boswell, vice president of steel mills; J.D. Haney, vice president
of fabricated reinforcing steel products; and J.C. Hogue, vice
president of employee relations.
   Gres said the company disclosed that its top managers were
considering making an offer because ``there have been a number of
rumors as to various things that might be happening, in particular
about a management leveraged buyout.''
   Florida Steel, whose products are mostly used in construction,
earned $16.9 million, or $2.80 per share, for the fiscal year ended
Sept. 30, 1987.
   The company, which makes reinforcing steel bars and rods, among
other products, employs about 2,400 people at plants in Tampa,
Jacksonville, Knoxville and Jackson, Tennessee, Charlotte, N.C.,
and at 15 small reinforcing steel fabricating divisions located
through the Southeast.
   Gres said the company is the largest producer and fabricator of
reinforcing steel bars in the United States.
   Florida Steel is what is known in the industry as a
``mini-mill,'' or company that melts down scrap steel to make its
products. Firms that make steel from ore are called integrated
mills.
   Gres said the company's clients are mostly located in the
southeastern and central United States.

<HEAD>Former Bank of Boston Vice President Accused Of Fraud</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: ADDS 3 new grafs after penultimate graf with more reaction

...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Bank of Boston Corp. vice president
appeared in court Friday on charges of conspiring to defraud the
bank of 15 million pounds, or around $25.5 million.
   Detectives from a special task force known as the Serious Fraud
Squad arrested Max Buteau, 39, on Wednesday, the day before he was
to go to his native Haiti.
   His request to be released on bail was turned down during his
court appearance on the grounds that he might attempt escape.
   Buteau, who lives in west London, resigned last month from the
bank's branch at Victoria in central London.
   During the seven-minute court session Friday, prosecutor Robert
Wardle said Buteau had been issuing false guarantees of payment on
behalf of the bank's London branch so that alleged co-conspirator
Tina Jeffe, a French doctor turned financial consultant, could
attract domestic and foreign corporations into her investment
business.
   Ms. Jeffe, 40, has fled Britain, Wardle said, leaving behind a
Bank of Boston account with a 300,000 pound, or $510,000, deficit.
   Wardle told the court that Buteau ``had no authority to issue
those letters, and concealed this from the bank.''
   Defense lawyer Stephanie Nedas said her client ``vigorously
denied the charge.''
   Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne Taylor said the U.S. bank was
cooperating with the investigation.
   Taylor denied reports that the bank had already begun making
payments to parties allegedly affected in the case.
   The spokesman said the bank does not expect significant earnings
losses due to any possible payments associated with the case.
   ``Any loss, should it occur, is expected to be substantially
less than the figure mentioned in the press reports out of
London,'' said Taylor. ``We also believe such payments would be
covered by present reserves and-or insurance.''
   Buteau's trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stronger-than-expected report on employment in
June drove bond prices lower Friday, capping a week of steady
decline.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped about 1
point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest
rate trends, jumped to 9.09 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday.
   The yield on the 30-year issue stood much lower _ at 8.83
percent _ a week earlier on Friday, July 1.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate in June dropped to 5.3 percent, its lowest level since 1974.
The positive job showing, indicating vigor in the economy, had a
negative impact on bond prices by arousing fears of accelerating
inflation.
   ``There's no doubt that the data had a strong bias to it,'' said
William Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``It's a constant reminder that the economy is fast
approaching a full employment status.''
   The fall in bond values was braked, Sullivan suggested, by a
rebound in the dollar Friday against other major currencies on
world markets.
   Maria Ramirez, a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said the bond decline also was cushioned by companion Labor
Department data showing that the average hourly wage was unchanged
at $9.27 last month. Wage increases tend to be a strong indicator
of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income assets such as
bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues declined \ point to 13-32 point, intermediate
maturities lost 7-16 point to 9-16 point, and 20-year issues fell
27-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, slipped 0.50 to 109.00. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, dropped
5.43 to 1,140.50.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, was down 1.59 at 282.44.
   In corporate trading, industrials lost | point and utilities
were down { point, according to the investment firm Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose 11 basis
points to 6.65 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills jumped 24 basis points to 6.97
percent while one-year bills advanced 16 basis points to 7.24
percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 7-16 percent, down from 7
9-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Prices Plunge Amid Market Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A clouded weekend weather outlook sent confidence and prices
plummeting Friday in the corn and soybean pits of the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower;
energy futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   The grain market's failure to rally on this week's long-range
drought forecasts for the Midwest prompted many traders to grab
profits ahead of the weekend, analysts said.
   The weekend forecasts were mostly bearish, with some private
forecasters increasing the amount of rain they expected to fall in
parts of the parched Farm Belt over the next two days.
   Analysts said some traders also developed jitters ahead of
Tuesday's release of an Agriculture Department crop report that
will provide tallies of this year's planted acreage and revised
crop production estimates.
   But the most discouraging factor was the market's own
performance during the week, said Rich Feltes, director of
commodity research for Refco Inc., a large speculative trading firm
based in Chicago.
   ``It's not the news, but the market's reaction to the news
that's most important,'' Feltes said. ``When the market fails to
react to bullish news, it immediately injects nervousness,
disappointment and fatigue into the market.''
   Friday marked the second consecutive session of sharply lower
corn, oat and soybean prices. Some corn contracts and most oat
contracts fell their 15-cents-a-bushel limit for daily trading, and
the contract for November delivery of soybeans plunged nearly the
45-cent limit for that market. Wheat futures were mostly higher.
   ``The market is perplexing,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's inexplicable why
we're down so hard when there isn't that much rain around and the
temperatures are very hot. Maybe the market knows something we
don't.''
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
6-to-10-day outlook, extending its forecast for above-normal
temperatures and below-normal rainfall in the Midwest through July
18.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents lower to 9 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 15
cents lower with July at $3.09{ a bushel; oats were 8 cents to 15
cents lower with July at $2.93 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents
lower to 40 cents lower with July at $9.24 a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Analysts said cattle traders reacted to the drop in grain
prices by reversing their recent trend of selling contracts for
summer and fall delivery while bidding up the 1989 contracts.
   Pork futures were lower in reaction to the drop in feed grain
prices, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``The grains are really dominating the day-to-day movement in
the cattle and hogs,'' he said.
   Live cattle were .55 cent lower to .33 cent higher with August
at 65.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .42 cent lower to .03
cent higher with August at 74.52 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent
to .60 cent lower with July at 45.37 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to 1.60 cents lower with July at 33.10 cents
a pound.
   Energy futures were mixed in moderate trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as dealers reassessed the impact of the recent
North Sea oil rig explosion on petroleum supplies and prospects for
an emergency OPEC meeting diminished.
   ``It may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today,'' said
Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 37 cents
lower with August at $15.46 a barrel; heating oil was .84 cent to
.90 cent lower with August at 43.39 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .28 cent lower to .32 cent higher with August at 53.17
cents a gallon.
   Gold futures finished nearly unchanged on New York's Commodity
Exchange, a sign of the market's strength in the face of falling
crude-oil and grain prices, said Craig Sloane, an analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Sloane said the Labor Department's report of a 0.3 percent drop
in unemployment last month was potentially inflationary and
supported precious-metals prices.
   Gold was 10 cents lower to 80 cents higher with August at $441 a
troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 8.5 cents higher with July at
$7 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.65 points lower at 271.55.

<TEXT>
   Continental Corp., one of the world's leading
insurance concerns, disclosed plans Friday to sell two life
insurance subsidiaries for a total of $213 million as part of a
previously announced divestment.
   The Commercial Life unit will be sold to two companies, Kaufman
& Broad Inc. and Unum Corp., for $179 million in cash. Kaufman &
Broad will get Commercial Life's annuity reserve business and Unum
will take the unit's other businesses, Continental said in a
statement.
   In addition, Continental will sell its Loyalty Life unit to a
group of unidentified private investors for cash and securities
totaling about $34 million, the company said.
   Based in New York, Continental is one of the world's largest
insurance organizations, with $5 billion in revenues and operations
in more than 100 countries. The company announced intentions last
September to divest its life insurance subsidiaries.
   In April the company sold its National Life Assurance Co. of
Canada unit.

<HEAD>Suspends Negotiations on Resuming Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday scrapped
negotiations aimed at resuming payments on its $9.2 billion foreign
debt, attributing the decision to lack of money.
   ``It is prudent to suspend renegotiations without setting a
renewal date,'' Finance Minister Eduardo Cabezas told a news
conference.
   He said falling prices for oil, from accounts for about 60
percent of Ecuador's income, and a shortage of foreign credit were
important considerations in its decision.
   The government of President Leon Febres Cordero suspended
payments on Ecuador's debt in March 1987, after a series of
earthquakes wreaked widespread destruction and severed a major oil
pipeline, paralyzing the oil export industry for six months.
   Cabezas said the the country's economic situation has worsened
this year and that recent presidential elections had caused a drop
in foreign exchange remittances, but he did not elaborate.
   Social Democrat Rodrigo Borja replaces conservative Febres
Cordero in August. Borja defeated populist Abdala Bucaram in May
following a heated campaign that incited frequent rumors of a
military coup.
   Cabezas said the government had based its budget on oil income
at $17.25 a barrel but has only been receiving $13.
   A plan to receive $350 million in loans from foreign banks had
also fallen through, further crippling the country's ability to
pay, he said.

<HEAD>Judge: Insider Trading Money Going to Investors, Not IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted insider trader Dennis B. Levine can't
pay his $12.2 million tax bill with the money he made through
illegal activities, a federal judge has ruled.
   Instead, said U.S. District Judge Richard Owen in a ruling late
Thursday, the money should go to compensate defrauded investors.
   Owen rejected motions by Levine and convicted co-conspirator
Robert Wilkis to pay off their tax liabilities with disgorged
profits now in the hands of the government.
   Owen also rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission's
proposed plan for distributing the $12.8 million disgorged by
Levine and the $3.4 million Wilkis has relinquished.
   The pair wanted their federa; tax bills _ $12.2 million for
Levine and more than $2.8 million for Wilkis _ to take precedence
over investor claims.
   The SEC at first balked, but later devised a compromise plan in
which 42 percent of the Levine money and 49 percent of the Wilkis
money would go toward federal and state tax claims.
   Owen refused to approve it.
   ``It is almost an affront to suggest that those defrauded by
Levine's insider trading activities have their recovery reduced by
the amount of his fine,'' said the judge, calling the fine
``personal and punitive in nature and as such is not subject to
payment out of Levine's illegal gains to the detriment of
investors.'
   Lawyers for both Levine and Wilkis said they would appeal the
ruling.
   Levine, a former Wall Street investment banker, confessed in
1986 to masterminding a massive insider trading scheme, using his
advance knowledge of impending takeover deals to profit by buying
and selling stocks.
   Levine's admissions implicated other Wall Street professionals,
including speculator Ivan Boesky, who paid the SEC a record $100
million in penalties and disgorged profits to settle an insider
trading claim.
   Levine pleaded guilty to four criminal counts and was sentenced
to two years in prison. Earlier this week he was released to a
halfway house for the remainder of his term.
   Wilkis, another former investment banker, pleaded guilty to
insider trading charges in 1986 and was sentenced to a year in
prison.

   Marvel Entertainment Group, the comic book

announced Thursday.
   New World, the movie and toy company that acquired Marvel for a

   Marvel, with comic book headquarters in New York and a TV

comics and books.
   New World, which did not give a reason for the sale, also
announced it expects a second-quarter operating loss of $25 million
before taxes.
   The company blamed the anticipated losses on box-office failure
of its three movies, ``18 Again,'' ``Dead Heat'' and ``Wrong
Guys;'' on high overhead and debt service and disappointing video
sales.

<HEAD>Report: South Korea To Lift Ban On Beef Imports Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to lift its
ban on beef imports and plans to order 15,000 tons of foreign beef
next week, the Yonhap News Agency reported Friday.
   Government officials declined to comment on the report, but said
an annoucement could be expected soon.
   Yonhap said no objections were raised on the floor of the
National Assembly to the proposed lifting of the ban when Deputy
Prime Minister Rha Woong-bae told the legislature Thursday that
Korea would suffer retaliation if it continued resisting U.S.
pressure to lift the ban.
   Rha noted the United States had complained to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the Korean beef import ban
violates fair trade practice. Rha said GATT was certain to rule
that Korea should immediately lift the ban, and if Korea did not do
so it would face legal retaliation from the United States and other
GATT memebrs.
   The government of President Roh Tae-woo originally planned to
lift the ban earlier this year but delayed action in the face of
strong domestic resistance.
   South Korea plans to buy just 15,000 tons of beef this year.
   Yonhap quoted officials as saying the tonnage to be ordered next
week included 5,000 tons of high quality beef to be imported from
the United States for use at hotels.
   The remaining 10,000 tons of beef of ordinary quality will be
for sales to the public and will be purchased through international
bidding to be conducted by a government-designated livestock
product distribution agency, Yonhap said.
   The officials were quoted as saying American and Australian
suppliers were expected to take part in the bidding next week.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf pvs, In trading ... to give closing stock

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restructuring plan that will increase USG
Corp.'s debt four-fold _ the legacy of the company's costly victory
in a takeover battle with Desert Partners L.P. _ was overwhelmingly
approved Friday by shareholders.
   Approval by 94 percent of the shareholders who cast votes
``indicates support for USG's continued existence as an independent
company run by current management,'' Chairman Robert Day said after
balloting was complete.
   A total of 51.8 million shares _ 70 percent of the outstanding
stock _ was represented in the vote.
   The restructuring plan, made necessary when the Chicago-based
building supply conglomerate's management rebuffed a takeover bid
by Desert Partners of Midland, Texas, will boost the company's debt
load to $3.1 billion from $800 million.
   Under the plan, shareholders of record by next Tuesday will be
entitled to $37 in cash, $5 in securities and one new share of
common stock for each common share they currently own.
   ``USG has historically carried a modest level of debt, and while
that is our preference, present circumstances require that we
provide an immediate return to shareholders,'' said Day. ``We
intend to reduce our debt load as rapidly as possible and are in a
strong position to do so.''
   Virtually all of the 20-minute comment period Friday on motions
affecting shareholders was devoted to the recapitalization.
   ``Many said they'd made a lot of money in the past and were
happy with the way things were,'' said Thomas Sleeter, manager of
investor relations. ``They didn't wany anybody to tamper.''
   The company's stock price had doubled over the past five years,
and was trading above $50 per share before October's market crash.
When Desert Partners launched its $42-per-share offer in March, USG
was trading below $30.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USG rose 50 cents a
share to close at $48.87{.
   Day and USG's current management won the bitter, protracted
takeover battle, but he acknowledged in an interview Thursday that
the price was a recapitalization that will inhibit USG's growth and
restrict its resources for several years.
   ``There are no winners in this. We're going into very heavy
leverage, and that has its negatives,'' Day said Thursday. ``We
don't feel we lost, but the whole process isn't one that gives us a
great deal of satisfaction, either.''
   As a result of the restructuring, an unspecified number of jobs
will be lost. Already, the work force has been cut 9 percent this
year, Day said.
   Two companies will be sold, reversing a trend that saw USG
acquire five companies in 1987.
   ``It will restrict our ability to pay dividends, to commit
capital to capital investments, and reduce our research and
development program. And these latter two, in particular, are the
things which provide growth for the future,'' Day said.
   He said the recapitalization was the only why to satisfy USG's
loyal, long-term investors and the newcomers who moved in on the
heels of Desert Partners.
   But he admitted he regrets the restructuring was necessary.
   ``I'm not bitter, but I am sorry,'' Day said. ``It's been very
costly, disruptive and demoralizing. So it's pretty hard to find
anything to feel good about.''

<TEXT>
   B.F. Goodrich Co. announced Thursday that it
had signed a letter of intent to sell a majority of units in its
fabricated polymers division to Richard Fasenmyer, the division's
president.
   Fasenmyer will acquire commercial wallcovering, rubber and
plastic matting, tank lining, industrial and commercial extrusion
units and a variety of other specialty rubber and plastic producing
units.
   Terms of the agreement, contingent on its approval by the
Goodrich board of directors, were not disclosed.
   ``The sale of most of our fabricated polymers division means
that we have now disposed of the last of our former industrial
products businesses,'' said Leigh Carter, Goodrich president and
chief operating officer. ``These businesses clearly did not fit
into our strategy, since we are now focusing on chemical and
aerospace operations.''
   The facilities involved had 1987 sales of about $80 million and
employ 750 people at plants in Akron, Marietta, Cincinnati and
Columbus, Ohio; Modesto, Calif.; and Livonia, Mich.
