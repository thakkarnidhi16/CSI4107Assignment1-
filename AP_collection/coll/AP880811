   Burmese troops killed at least 15 more people Thursday, a crowd
of thousands had soldiers surrounded in a Rangoon suburb, and the
government gave its first hint that an end to the protests might
bring concessions.
   Coupled with the offer to consider the people's ``legitimate
requests,'' however, was a stern declaration by the armed forces
commander that Burma is threatened by the ``anarchy of the
violence-makers.''
   Rangoon radio said protesters, who demand that President Sein
Lwin be ousted, were preparing firebombs and planning to
``escalate'' violence, but Western diplomats in the Burmese capital
reported no large demonstrations Thursday. Tens of thousands had
been in the streets the previous two days.
   A senior Western diplomat in Rangoon said all gasoline stations
were closed Thursday, apparently as a precaution against arson and
the manufacture of firebombs.
   Broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, said 15 people were
killed and 81 wounded in the third day of street confrontations, in
which security forces have opened fire repeatedly to disperse
crowds. According to official figures, 95 people have been killed
and 240 wounded in Burma since violence began Tuesday.
   The radio said Thursday that 10,000 people surrounded an army
unit the day before in the Rangoon suburb of North Okkalapa,
shooting had occurred and reinforcements were sent in. It said
three aircraft dropped leaflets warning that security forces would
shoot unless the crowds dispersed.
   Diplomats reported clashes in the area Thursday. The radio said
without giving details that the only large demonstration in the
country involved 1,000 people in North Okkalapa.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
there were reports of continued demonstrations in the suburbs of
Rangoon and in the major northern city of Mandalay.
   ``We understand central Rangoon appears to be quiet with a heavy
troop presence in that part of the city,'' she said.
   Students have circulated a list of demands to diplomats, The New
York Times reported in its Friday editions. Among the demands were
holding a multiparty referendum, freedom for jailed government
opponents, an end to martial law and a reduction in the cost of
living, the newspaper reported. It said it was unclear whether the
demands had been presented to the government.
   Premier Tun Tin promised on Rangoon radio Thursday night that
authorities ``will seriously consider legitimate requests of the
people ... in accordance with the law.''
   He said planned economic reforms will be implemently urgently to
improve living conditions, but only if the violence ends. Diplomats
say economic crisis and rampant inflation are among the reasons for
the uprising that began after Sein Lwin, a former general, assumed
power two weeks ago in the nation of 38 million people.
   Sau Maung, the armed forces commander, said in the same
broadcast the army would continue its tough response. He said
soldiers were restrained at first, but that changed when
``dishonest elements'' took over the protests. ``The people are now
facing anarchy of the violence-makers,'' he said.
   Diplomats said security forces in North Okkalapa, where the
soldiers were surrounded, were attacked Wednesday by residents
armed with weapons either captured or provided by defectors from
the military.
   They cited unconfirmed reports that at least two truckloads of
soldiers joined the protesters.
   Earlier radio reports said mobs beheaded three policemen
Wednesday in North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa.
   The senior Western diplomat said protesters initially tried to
avoid clashes but became enraged after unprovoked killings Tuesday.
On Wednesday, he said, protesters began confronting soldiers and
``in effect defying them to shoot.''
   He said protesters began piling bricks, trees and stones on
streets Wednesday night to block military vehicles. He said some
firearms may have been captured, but most weapons werek such
makeshift items as spears made of stripped umbrellas.
   ``These were unarmed, peaceful demonstrators, and they still are
mostly, but now they've gotten more violent,'' he said.
   Protesters were said to have taken over Pegu, about 45 miles
northeast of Rangoon, with no response from the army, the diplomat
said.
   Travelers from Rangoon said the city of 3.5 million was at a
virtual standstill, with most shops, offices and markets closed.
They said buildings were pocked by bullets and bloodstains marked
the locations of street fights.
   Martial law was imposed on the capital after a student march
Aug. 3 and an 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew took effect Tuesday.
   Mrs. Oakley said in Washington that a new advisory was issued
for Americans, warning them not to travel to Burma. Britain, France
and Japan have issued such warnings and France advised French
tourists in Burma to leave.
   Britain denied on Thursday earlier reports that Burmese troops
clubbed the British military attache with rifle butts during
protest violence in Rangoon. The Foreign Office said Col. Michael
Bremridge was held for about two hours in an identity card mixup,
but ``was treated perfectly reasonably and sensibly.''
   The protests are by far the largest since a coup by Ne Win ended
democracy in Burma in 1962. Sein Lwin became the nation's president
and head of the government party when Ne Win resigned after 26
years in power.
   Protesters accuse Sein Lwin of ruthlessly suppressing student
riots in March and June, when he was an army general, and earlier
harsh measures against dissenters.

   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, discarding
normal Senate courtesies, ignored another GOP senator's
long-standing objections Thursday night and permitted confirmation
of a backlog of 45 presidential nominees.
   The action filled diplomatic vacancies, many of them months old,
at U.S. embassies in nations around the world, including El
Salvador, Lebanon, Syria, Bolivia and Colombia.
   Dole said the Senate logjam had been caused by Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., who had used Senate tradition to place a ``hold''
on President Reagan's nomination of veteran Foreign Service officer
Christopher W. S. Ross to be the new U.S. ambassador to Algeria.
   Humphrey apparently had no objections to Ross personally but was
using his Senate privileges to gain leverage on an unrelated issue.
   He sought to pressure the State Department to name a special
U.S. envoy to resistance forces in Afghanistan to coordinate U.S.
policy during the withdrawal of Soviet occupying forces from that
country.
   Dole said he had just received a handwritten note from Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead reading in part, ``to solve Sen.
Humphrey's problem we will appoint a special envoy for
Afghanistan.''
   But the Republican leader said he could not find Humphrey who
was away from the Senate floor.
   Nor could he locate any member of Humphrey's staff.
   The Senate was about to adjourn until Sept. 7 on its annual
Labor Day recess.
   Dole said he was reluctant to have the nominations delayed so
long.
   ``There are 45 nominations being tied up here,'' Dole said.
   He said he then called Whitehead who confirmed the State
Department will appoint a special envoy for Afghanistan.
   ``He said he cannot go as far as Senator Humphrey wants on the
powers such an envoy will have but he is going to make the
appointment,'' Dole reported.
   Dole said he was handling the Ross nomination separately from
the others to create a separate record ``so Senator Humphrey
understands we did not do this lightly.''
   Under the circumstances, Dole said, ``I feel justified in
waiving Senator Humphrey's hold on the nominee.''
   The Senate then moved by voice votes to confirm the other
delayed nominees.
   At a news conference earlier this week, Humphrey urged certain
GOP presidential nominee George Bush to select a conservative
running mate.
   He replied affirmatively when asked if he would strike Dole from
the list.
   Dole made no mention of Humphrey's statement as he acted to end
the delay on the nominations caused by the New Hampshire senator's
objections.
   Those confirmed included Ross and Edward P. Djerejian to be
ambassador to Syria, John T. McCarthy to be ambassador to Lebanon,
Thomas E . McNamara to be ambassador to Colombia, Robert S. Gelbard
to be ambassador to Bolivia, John F. Kordek to be ambassador to
Botswana, Carl C. Cundiff to be ambassador to Niger, John A.
Burroughs Jr. to be ambassador to Uganda, Robert L. Pugh to be
ambassador to Chad, and William H. Twaddell to be ambassador to
Mauritania.
   Other confirmed nominations included those of William H. Fite to
be an assistant director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, Martin H. Newlin to represent the United States at the
International Atomic Energy Agency, and Don E. Newquist to be a
member of the U.S. International Trade Commission.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca says he
holds no grudges against Henry Ford II for firing him a decade ago,
preferring to remember the times when they went hunting, went to
parties or ``caroused Europe together.''
   ``My difficulty with Henry Ford was over long before he died
last year,'' the 63-year-old Iacocca wrote in Aug. 29's Fortune
magazine, which was made available Wednesday.
   The grandson of Ford's founder died last September after more
than 40 years at the helm of the nation's second-largest automaker.
   Iacocca, who rose to stardom in the auto industry after creating
the super-popular Mustang, was fired after more than 20 years at
Ford Motor Co. in 1978. He has been at Chrysler since then and is
credited with putting the once-troubled company back on its feet
with the help of $1.2 billion in government-guaranteed loans.
   ``A lot of people told me Henry Ford II did me a favor 10 years
ago by firing me,'' Iacocca wrote. ``They said that if I had stayed
at Ford, I would have been in a comfortable ivory tower. ... By
getting canned in 1978 I got thrown into a situation where I became
a leader.''
   Iacocca had few kind words to say about Henry Ford II in his
first book, ``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' but in the Fortune
article, he recalled how he and Ford ``hunted together, we went to
parties together, we caroused Europe together.''
   ``I remember the 16 good years, and not the two bad ones in 1977
and 1978.''

<TEXT>
   IVRY-SUR-SEINE, France (AP) _ A stone's throw from the Seine
River, the bit of a drill under a towering white derrick bores a
hole under suburban Paris in search of oil that might one day be
dubbed Paris Crude.
   ``Normally, I do the North Sea,'' drilling superviser Lars
Froybu said Wednesday during a tour of the site. ``This is quite
different.
   ``There, you are in the sea and live on a rig for 24 hours a
day. Here, 10 minutes away you can find lots of good restaurants.
You're drilling in civilization.''
   Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, a state-owned oil company,
started sinking the exploratory well at Ivry, on the southern edge
of Paris, Tuesday. It is the first of several such wells planned
under the Paris-Ile de France permit, which covers Paris and its
northern, eastern and southern suburbs.
   The permit was awarded in December 1985 to Elf, Total Compagnie
Francaises des Petroles, and British Petroleum after competition
reached a pinnacle in the search for oil in the Paris Basin, 50,000
square miles stretching east from Paris to the West German border.
   For years there have been rumblings that the City of Light
itself might be sitting on crude, a theory that provoked smiles,
cute headlines and gags about industrializing the Eiffel Tower.
   Oil companies are less fanciful. The Elf-Total-BP association
already has spent $11.6 million on its permit, most of it for
seismic tests, according to the chief of Elf's French operations,
Bruno Weymuller.
   The Paris Basin contains 40 million tons of known oil reserves,
48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells.
   With a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells, compared to the 1 in 20
average, the Basin is increasingly drawing foreign oil companies,
although oil executives concede it will never be Houston.
   But ``no one dared go into this area before,'' Louis Prudhomme,
Elf's assistant director of French operations, said of the region.
   About 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered by
the permit, and Elf is making a special effort to be discreet, at
least as discreet as one can be with a 165-foot oil derrick
operating round-the-clock.
   Motors powering the drill are kept in sheds beside the derrick.
A wall to cut noise was erected to help shield residents of an
apartment block across the street. A special phone line was
installed to receive complaints.
   ``We've tried to protect the environment to a maximum,'' said
Prudhomme.
   Ivry, on the left bank of the Seine, is one of several sites
considered promising on the basis of seismic tests.
   The objective of the Ivry drilling is in fact about a half-mile
from the derrick, on the right bank of the Seine. That means the
bit grinding its way 2,000 yards into the earth must follow a
deviated course, complicating drilling, officials said.
   By Wednesday morning, a hole 2,067 foot deep had been bored, the
drilling superviser said.
   The operation is to be completed in about three weeks. A
positive find would mean boring ``appreciation'' wells nearby to
determine the size of the oil deposit, according to Elf officials.
   Total has said it plans to start drilling before the end of the
year.
   Limited seismic tests of the capital, made two years ago,
revealed that the center of Paris was ``not a geological
priority,'' Elf officials said.
   ``Is there oil under Paris? We will only know when we've
drilled. That is the moment of truth.'' Prudhomme said. ``We've
already staked out forage sites if one day we have to work in
Paris.''
   A derrick could be erected at a stadium or in an unused train
station or abandoned apartment buildings, according to officials
who do not rule out rigging a derrick on a boat on the Seine.
   No one in France stands to get rich overnight by owning land on
a drilling site. The property owner receives a modest ``rent'' from
the oil company, but the state controls mineral rights.
   Parisians, easily moved to protest, remain placid in the face of
the Ivry drilling.
   ``If they put a gas pump on my route and lower the price, that's
all I care about,'' said Jean-Louis Ribolla, a waiter near the
Champs Elysees.
   ``Finding oil in the Place de la Concorde would be quite
refined,'' he added, winking.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has canceled a bathing suit
``fashion'' show intended to give a parting charge to the crew of
the USS Enterprise before the aircraft carrier takes off for two
weeks of training at sea.
   Capt. Robert Spane, commander of the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier, said he canceled the show after reading news reports that
the show could be construed as sexually oriented entertainment
forbidden under Naval regulations.
   More than 3,000 men were scheduled to crowd the decks for a
half-hour show at the Alameda Naval Air Station base. The show was
to feature models in bathing suits and aerobic wear bouncing
rhythmically to pop music.
   ``The boys are going to be charged up before they go out for two
weeks,'' Ivan Cutler, a spokesman for the swimwear and aerobics
clothing manufacturer that was to put on the show, said Tuesday
before the cancellation. He called the scheduled show a ``morale
booster.''
   However, Navy regulations ban sexually oriented entertainment at
base clubs, stating that ``entertainment that could conceivably
result in embarrassment to the Navy shall be avoided'' because it
could cause abusive behavior toward women who serve aboard Navy
ships.
   The San Francisco-based Feminist Bookstore News, which publishes
a monthly magazine for women's bookstores, called the dance show
idea ``outrageous.''
   ``It looks like the Enterprise brass still haven't discerned the
difference between sex and war,'' said publisher Carol Seajay.
``Using women and sexual innuendo to gear men up for war games
perpetuates that confusion.''
   On Wednesday, Cutler said he was disappointed the event had been
canceled.
   ``It was an opportunity to entertain _ within bounds of
propriety _ sailors, who respond to a variety of stimulus,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The Nottingham Playhouse did big business last
year with Agatha Christie's ever-popular ``... And Then There Were
None,'' hardly the gritty social realism that made its reputation
in the 1960s.
   The Royal Shakespeare Company, better known for its ``Hamlet''
and ``King Lear,'' has had to brush up its Shakespeare with Cole
Porter's musical ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
   Such forays into lower-brow fare may horrify the purists, but
Britain's government-funded theaters say they have little choice,
given rising production costs and the hostility of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government toward subsidizing the
arts.
   The new mood was set last year by Arts Minister Richard Luce
when he declared: ``It's time the arts world got rid of its
welfare-state mentality.''
   The notion of taxpayers' money funding the arts has been
sacrosanct since World War II. This year the state is giving $690
million to the arts, about one-third of it to theaters through the
quasi-governmental Arts Council.
   But some critics suggest the erosion of subsidy means an erosion
of quality. They point to the RSC's embarrassment over ``Carrie,''
its $7 million musical that flopped on Broadway after a short run
at Stratford in February.
   Some argue that the theater handsomely repays the government's
investment. Peter Hall, artistic director of the National Theater,
said last year: ``It is simply daft economics, let alone daft
culture, to apply a dogmatic view that subsidy is sick and bad.
   ``I don't believe the arts cost Britain a penny,'' he said. ``It
has not occurred to the current government that the arts is one of
the few absolute success stories of Britain since the War.''
   The Policy Studies Institute, a non-profit research group,
published a recent study showing that the arts are a $17
billion-a-year sector of the British economy, and that one-fourth
of tourist income is spent on cultural activity.
   It said the arts account for 2.5 percent of all spending on
goods and services in Britain and directly employ 496,000 people,
or 2.1 percent of the work force.
   But theater insiders concede that the subsidies battle is lost
and greater concessions to commercialism are inevitable.
   Some even find it desirable. ``It behooves us to go out and make
our money from time to time and to have that commercial hard
knack,'' Terry Hands, artistic director of the RSC and director of
``Carrie,'' said recently in an interview with The Guardian
newspaper.
   The RSC faced a $1.89 million deficit last year and briefly
considered closing its Stratford base. It was rescued largely by a
$2.55 million grant from the Royal Insurance Company and by the
commercial success of ``Les Miserables,'' the Tony award-winning
musical based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel.
   ``Les Miserables,'' a hit here and on Broadway, is bringing the
company up to $1.7 million a year in worldwide royalties.
   In London, Christopher Hampton's long-running ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' has been netting the RSC $260,000 a year since it
began an open-ended commercial run in October 1986.
   With profits of up to $500,000 from ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' and a
$344,000 fee for the ill-fated ``Carrie,'' even its less
commercially successful ventures have brought the RSC some cash.
   Still, the RSC is not alone in its new bout with commercialism.
   The National Theater, the country's other major subsidized
company, has been playing safe with such Broadway plays as Neil
Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and Brian Clark's ``The
Petition,'' and undemanding revivals such as Arthur Wing Pinero's
``The Magistrate'' and George Abbott and John Cecil Holm's ``Three
Men on a Horse.''
   The National says 52 percent of its annual turnover is now
self-earned. Since 1985, it says, its subsidy of over $12 million
has fallen by over $3.5 million in real terms.
   The Nottingham Playhouse, which began in 1963 producing such
offbeat plays as Frank Wedekind's ``Lulu'' and Peter Barnes' ``The
Ruling Class,'' now leans heavily toward Agatha Christie and
farces, such as ``Fur Coat and No Knickers,'' to keep costs down
and audiences up.
   Some theaters have come up with novel ways to make ends meet.
   The Crucible Theater in Sheffield rented out its auditorium for
a billiards championship so it could go on financing rarely seen
classics and daring new material.
   ``It's the weird situation of buildings built on one philosophy
having to survive in a society operating on another philosophy,''
said Clare Venables, the Crucible's artistic director, in an
interview.
   The Crucible is one of many playhouses built in provincial
cities in the 1960s when the prevailing social philosophy held that
the state had a duty to foster the arts.
   ``The aspirations of the '60s look sick today,'' wrote Paul
Allen in The New Statesman. The arts, he said, are ``regarded with
something surprisingly akin to hatred ... in the new, sourer
political climate.''
   The National's Hall agreed: ``There's a feeling now in the
subsidized sector, and I speak not for myself but for my
colleagues, that we are simply not wanted.
   ``They wish we would just go away so they could turn the whole
thing into the American model. That would be a disaster.''
   Commercial sponsorship is relatively new in Britain and viewed
with some suspicion. But theaters are learning to live with it.
   The RSC's press releases say ``sponsored by Royal Insurance.''
Recent theater programs at the National emblazoned the logos of
Citicorp@Citibank and Ladbroke Group Plc over such classics as
``The Threepenny Opera'' and ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   But sponsorship has its limitations. Earlier this year, the
National lost an unnamed backer for a revival of John Ford's 1633
``'Tis Pity She's a Whore'' because the firm balked at the title,
and ended up financing the production from its own funds.
   ``What we're talking about is creative life depending on
sponsorship, rather than being something that sprang from a
community activity,'' says Patsy Silburn, chairwoman of the East
Midlands branch of the Arts Council.
   ``There are fewer and fewer places where one could say with any
conviction there's a vibrant and dynamic theater.''

<DATELINE>ALLENBY BRIDGE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic across this
rickety bridge has swelled as thousands of Arabs stream into Jordan
for what many fear could be a final visit now that Jordan has
severed ties with the West Bank.
   The action by King Hussein of Jordan has caused widespread
concern among Palestinians that Jordan will close the bridge, their
primary link to relatives in the Arab world and the West Bank's
major export avenue.
   ``We have serious concerns about our future,'' said Salwa Abu
Kaf of Jerusalem as she left for Amman with her five small children
this week.
   ``I am going to spend two weeks with my parents. King Hussein
might decide to close the bridges and if he does, it will be my
last visit,'' said Mrs. Abu Kaf, 27, who wore a traditional
ankle-length Moslem dress and scarf.
   Israeli officials say movement across the Allenby and Damiya
bridges into Jordan has increased by more than 30 percent since
Hussein's July 31 announcement that he was cutting ties with Arabs
in the occupied lands.
   The king scrapped a $1.3 billion development plan for the
territories, laid off 21,200 Jordanian employees in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and shut a ministry for territorial affairs in his
government. Jordan had maintained administrative ties even though
Israel captured the territories in 1967.
   Despite a pledge to keep the bridges open and honor all
Jordanian passports, Hussein's steps raised fears among West Bank
Palestinians they may no longer be allowed to travel to Jordan or
settle there as Jordanian citizens.
   Most of the West Bank's 850,000 Palestinians and some of the
650,000 Arabs who live in Gaza hold Jordanian passports.
   Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million people are Palestinians with
Jordanian passports, many with relatives in the occupied lands.
   ``Everyone carrying a Jordanian passport is running scared with
this,'' said Moussa Assad, a Palestinian migrant farm worker in
Saudi Arabia who said he crosses the bridge seven times a year to
visit his family in Gaza City.
   ``If the king closes the bridge and takes away our passports, it
is the end for me. I won't be able to travel, to work, to make
money for my family. Many of us have no other way to survive,''
said Assad, 41, fingering a string of flourescent green worry beads.
   Mohammed Faiz Danah of Hebron said he would leave his nursing
job in Saudi Arabia if the bridges were closed.
   ``Palestine is my country. I have my own land, my business, my
mother, my sons here. I am a foreigner in Saudi Arabia,'' Danah
said.
   Some Palestinians said they planned to seek residence in Jordan
so their families would not be separated.
   ``If tomorrow they close the bridges, what are we going to do?
My husband is dead, I have nothing here,'' said 63-year-old Hamdah
Masherehdah, who said she planned to move in with her sister and
son in Amman.
   Pop music blared through loudspeakers Tuesday as hundreds of
Palestinians streamed into the Allenby's vast, modern passenger
terminal set among sand dunes just yards from the wooden plank
bridge.
   Because of the increased volume, Israeli officials say they are
keeping the bridges open an extra three hours each day and have
waived the requirement that Palestinians pay their taxes before
being allowed to cross into Jordan.
   ``In the last days, there has been more pressure on people to
cross to take care of their affairs. We are trying to make the
passage easier,'' said West Bank military government spokesman
Olivier Rafowicz.
   Some West Bank businessmen expressed concern Hussein's measures
may hurt Palestinian exporters who rely on the bridges.
   ``I'm afraid for the future. If there's no way to export, I'll
have to close my factory, fire my 13 workers and I'll be ruined,''
said Ahmed Soubeh, who owns a stone-cutting firm in Bethlehem that
exports stone through Jordan.
   ``The Jordanian decisions are being taken very quickly without
prior notice. This is the scary part. Who knows what tomorrow will
hold? We are pawns in the whole picture,'' Soubeh said.
   A Hebron building contractor, Abdulghar Dufesh, said West Bank
builders are owed $20 million for projects contracted by Jordan.
``Will we be paid and when? All we contractors are worried and
wringing our hands.''

   Summer rains in Mexico's northwest have
eased severe drought conditions in the vital agricultural and
cattle ranching region, but farm leaders say the crisis isn't over.
   ``We've been blessed by rains. It doesn't solve the problem, but
it does raise our spirits,'' said Hector Roman, president of the
Sonora state Confederation of Agriculture Organizations.
   A yearlong drought in Mexico's northwestern grain-belt sapped
water supplies, forcing major reductions in crop plantings last
fall and this spring in northwestern Sonora and Sinaloa states.
   Northern Baja California, Chihuahua and Coahuila states still
are suffering effects of the drought that parched crops and turned
pastures into barren fields.
   In some areas of Sonora and Chihuahua the spring planting season
was scrapped altogether as dam levels fell to less than 10 percent
of capacity.
   Most affected are sorghum, soybeans, corn, rice and wheat.
   At least 660,000 head of cattle have died, mostly in the
northwest, because of a lack of water and feed caused by the
drought, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Beef packers have been importing U.S. cattle in the northwestern
state of Chihauhua for several weeks. In Monterrey, capital of
northeastern Nuevo Leon state, such imports began in July under a
government-approved plan to ensure supplies and keep prices down.
   ``The damage has been done,'' said Jose Antonio Mendoza, manager
of the Confederation of Agriculture Associations in Sinaloa state.
He said 82 percent of more than 900,000 acres normally planted with
soybeans, sorghum and rice were idled by the drought.
   Mendoza said the federation estimates Sinaloa farmers have lost
about $330 million in direct income.
   ``For the first time in about 15 years Sinaloa state's gross
product won't increase. In fact it'll fall by about 4 percent,'' he
said in an interview from the state capital of Culiacan.
   Mendoza estimated about 70 percent of Sinaloa's productive
sector relies on agriculture.
   Roman said farmers in Sonora's Mayo Valley are scrambling to get
government credits to buy corn seed now that rains have helped
recoup water levels.
   He said 37,000 acres of corn could be planted in the coming
weeks if the credits are approved. But that's still down from the
150,000 acres normally planted in the cycle, Roman said.
   ``We could be planting corn and now there's no credit,'' said
Roman.
   Maria Luisa Elizondo, an agricultural economist at the National
Bank of Mexico in Mexico City, said rain in the northwest means
Mexico won't have to import as much wheat, corn and soybean as
feared.
   But Mexico still is looking at spending $300 million to $500
million more on imported grains this year than in 1987, she said.
   ``We'll have to pay more because the products will cost more
because of the drought in the United States,'' she said.
   Mendoza said it will have to rain throughout August to assure a
good water supply for the fall planting season, which begins in
October.
   ``We're a lot more optimistic than we were a few weeks ago. But
the level of the dams still isn't sufficient to cover the
fall-winter season,'' he said.
   ``What we need is a cyclone. Those always fill up the dams.''

<HEAD>Jews Disagree About Fund Named For T.S. Eliot</HEAD>

   Jewish opinion has been split by a library fund to
mark the 100th birthday of poet T.S. Eliot, who critics say was
notoriously anti-Semitic. Three distinguished Jews are among the
fund's supporters.
   ``T.S. Eliot's writings were undoubtedly anti-Semitic and Jews
will not be alone in having qualms about supporting a fund to mark
his centenary,'' said Hayim Pinner, secretary-general of the Board
of Deputies of British Jews.
   Eliot was born in St. Louis in 1888, became a British subject
and died in Britain in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for literature
and Britain's coveted Order of Merit.
   He was chairman of the privately run London Library, which has
appealed for $170,000 to establish a trust fund in his name and is
inviting American donations. The fund's purpose is to pay the
subscriptions of students and scholars who otherwise could not
afford to use the library.
   Jews associated with the appeal include Lewis Golden, the
library's honorary treasurer and a member of the appeal committee,
and patrons Sir Isaiah Berlin, the Oxford University philosopher,
and Lord Goodman, a leading London lawyer and arts enthusiast.
   ``The London Library would have done better to honor one of any
number of great British writers and poets untainted by race hatred
at its ugliest,'' Pinner said.
   David Nathan, deputy editor of the weekly Jewish Chronicle,
raised the issue originally. He said he believes Eliot's writings
helped block the escape of some Jews from Nazi Germany.
   ``I think Eliot was responsible in part for creating a climate
of opinion in the 1930s in which American and British politicians
and bureaucrats closed the doors to many people who could have been
rescued from the gas ovens,'' Nathan said in an interview.
   Golden granted that at least one Eliot work contained
``objectionable'' phrases, but said the poet ultimately believed
``our culture is based on the legacy of Greece, Rome and Israel.''
   Nathan said Golden had responded to his complaints by saying
``he wasn't aware of Eliot's anti-Semitism.''
   ``I have the most enormous admiration for Eliot as a poet,''
Nathan said. ``If I thought he was second rate, I wouldn't have
bothered.''
   In its appeal, the library says Eliot is ``one of the greatest
figures of 20th century literature. His influence is worldwide.''
   Critics say Eliot's anti-Semitism is blatant, including the
writing of ``jew'' without a capital J to emphasize inferiority.
   In the 1927 poem ``Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a
Cigar,'' Eliot wrote: ``The rats are underneath the piles. The jew
is underneath the lot.''
   Eliot said in a lecture in January 1933, as Adolf Hitler was
about to take power in Germany: ``Reasons of race or religion
combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable
... and a spirit of excessive tolerance is to be deprecated.''
   Nathan said Eliot dehumanized Jews ``and that allows racism of
all kinds.''
   Golden commented: ``Although one cannot excuse it, the
objectionable poem by Eliot has to be read in the context of the
attitude prevalent in the 1920s and expressed in some quarters in
America and elsewhere, long before the dreadful consequences of the
Nazis' frenzied use of anti-Semitism as a political weapon burst
upon the world.
   ``What could be more indicative of Eliot's ultimate feelings is
contained in his book `Notes Towards a Definition of Culture,'
published in 1948, where he more than once mentions that our
culture is based on the legacy of Greece, Rome and Israel.''
   Michael Hastings, who explored Eliot's strained first marriage
in a 1985 play called ``Tom and Viv,'' said: ``Even after he got
the Nobel Prize, Eliot continued to write dozens of racial
limericks to his friends, referring to kikes and niggers. I don't
think it's excusable for a Nobel laureate to behave in that way.''
   Peter Forbes, editor of Britain's leading poetry magazine,
Poetry Review, said: ``I think the anti-Semitism detracts from
Eliot's status as a major culural figure.
   ``Many people feel uneasy with his status as a cultural guru
because of his anti-Semitism, but nobody ever suspected Eliot of
being a progressive. He was a famous reactionary.''
   Thomas Stearns Eliot, poet, sometime bank clerk, playwright and
publisher, was born in St. Louis on Sept. 26, 1888, and became a
British subject in 1927. His most famous poem was ``The Waste
Land.''
   The centenary will be an international event, including
conferences, lectures, exhibitions and poetry readings in Britain,
the United States, France, Spain and Japan.

   At the beginning of the summer, the 16
high school computer jocks were in awe of the $1 million
supercomputer like the one ETA Systems Inc. will award to one of
their schools Friday.
   But as their six-week competition doing research projects on the
ETA10-P winds up, some of the students admit they have become a
little blase.
   ``When we first got here, the supercomputer looked s-o-o-o big,
s-o-o-o wonderful, and it really is. Don't get me wrong,'' said
15-year-old Doreen Pettus, who will be a junior this fall at North
Florida Christian High School in Tallahassee.
   ``But the closer you get to it, I mean, it's just crazy because
the kids back home think it's s-o-o-o awesome. And we're here and
we got used to it,'' Miss Pettus said.
   The teen-age competitors, who worked on individual projects but
are being judged in teams representing four high schools, now share
professionals' complaints about the computer's ``slowness'' in
making calculations, she said. The supercomputer has a capacity of
375 million operations per second, according to ETA Systems.
   ``You get a different perspective of things when you've been
here,'' Miss Pettus said.
   The contest was the brainchild of ETA's president, Carl
Ledbetter, who said he hopes it will encourage Americans to focus
more attention on math and science education.
   Entry forms were mailed to all public and private high schools
in the country, although company officials expected no more than 50
schools to apply. They were amazed when 1,475 schools did, he said.
   The Educational Testing Service helped the company winnow the
applications to 99 semifinalists and then the final four high
schools, Ledbetter said.
   In addition to North Florida Christian, the finalists are
Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md.; Thomas
Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria,
Va.; and James Logan High School in Union City, Calif.
   The ``Superquest'' contest is being judged by an independent
panel of five scientists headed by Kenneth Wilson, who received the
1982 Nobel Prize for his work on computational physics. The winning
school will be announced Friday night at a formal dinner, with the
contestants' parents in attendance.
   Besides the supercomputer, the top school will get two years of
operating costs, which are worth $7,000 to $10,000 a month, and a
company employee to advise them on the machine's use.
   The other schools won't go home empty-handed, though. Each will
receive a $50,000 Control Data Corp. Cyber 910 graphics work
station, and each student is getting $3,000 for participating. ETA
Systems is Control Data's supercomputer division.
   This year's contestants have been a serious group. ``There's a
little game playing but not a lot. I've actually brought games in
to try and relieve the tension,'' said Neil Lincoln, the company's
supercomputer architect.
   Miss Pettus decorated her corner of an ETA Systems workroom in
typical schoolgirl fashion with a high school pennant and a poster,
but her description of her project belied her 15 years.
   ``I think the correct title is `A Life Cycle Factor Simulation
of the Southern Bald Eagle,''' she said.
   She explained that she had obtained data about eagles in Florida
for the last 15 years. Her model was created to try to mimic that
data and produce the same results so she could project what will
happen to the eagles.
   Around the corner, 17-year-old Daniel Mall, a senior at
Montgomery Blair, talked with equal seriousness abut his project.
   ``Basically, the purpose of my program is to design some type of
material surface structure to apply to boat hulls,'' he said. The
objective is to reduce drag.
   Nearby, his 16-year-old teammate, Sven Hiralal Khatri, also a
senior, was intent on his computational program evaluating the
growth of urban regions from Washington, D.C., to Boston with
respect to time.
   Ledbetter acknowledges that the contest, in addition to focusing
attention on science and math education, also is powerful
advertising for the 5-year-old company.
   ``It also happened to be coincidental with the fact that for the
first time in the history of the computer industry, it's possible
to put a supercomputer in a high school,'' he said.
   ``For the first time at ETA, we have developed a supercomputer
that's air-cooled. It's a little tiny thing. You think of them as
being big behemoths,'' he said.
   Ledbetter said he hopes ETA Systems can hire some of this year's
contestants. The only problem, he said, is having to wait until
they've earned their college degrees.

   Nurses at San Francisco General Hospital
and other public facilities narrowly approved a new one-year
contract Wednesday night, averting a health care emergency at city
hospitals.
   About 1,500 nurses at private hospitals remained on strike, but
resumed talks with hospital administrators.
   The 1,600 public nurses represented by Local 790 of the United
Public Employees voted 320-307 for the new pact, said Donna Gerber,
field representative for the union.
   Members of Local 250 and Affiliated Hospitals, a group of
private hospitals, began their first day of formal mediation
Tuesday. About 4,000 nurses and support workers are striking
against eight private hospitals.
   San Francisco General and Laguna Honda, several health care
clinics and one jail faced a strike by Local 790 nurses if the new
municipal contract had not been ratified.
   The nurses' negotiating committee had recommended that the
contract be approved.
   The private hospitals are negotiating with the CNA and Local 250
in a group called Affiliated Hospitals.
   CNA, which has not yet resumed talks, is on strike at
Children's, St. Mary's, Marshal Hale, Mount Zion and St. Francis in
San Francisco and Seton in nearby Daly City. Local 250 is striking
at those, plus Pacific Presbyterian.
   An eighth facility, French Hospital, joined the strike Saturday.
Their talks are being held separately.
   Local 250's dispute centers on health benefits and sick leave.
The nurses are fighting for pay increases.

   About two dozen railroad cars derailed
and piled up along the Soo Line track here Wednesday, forcing about
1,000 people to evacuate homes and businesses, but no one was
seriously hurt, authorities said.
   Residents withinin a half-mile radius of the site were sent to a
nearby church because some tanker cars were carrying hazardous
materials, Waukesha County emergency officials said.
   Brookfield Fire Chief Jim Mehring said initial checks showed no
known leaks in the tanker cars, which carried propane, methanol and
some type of caustic acid. A hazardous materials team was sent to
the scene.
   Police and fire departments from neighboring communities were
assisting in cleanup operations.
   Waukesha County Sheriff Lt. Terry Martorano said he did not
expect residents would be allowed to return until Thursday, after
heavy equipment was brought from Chicago to unstack the cars.
   Authorities said a tanker car apparently lost a wheel gear
causing the the 24-car derailment in the 110-car train.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Plan to Reduce Lead in Drinking Water</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto WX7</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists say a new government
proposal to reduce dangerous lead in drinking water supplies is a
step in the right direction, but one that doesn't go far enough.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it
plans to issue rules requiring half the nation's water plants,
about 53,000, to treat water so that it contains less lead. The
metal causes a variety of harmful physical and mental effects.
   EPA administrator Lee A. Thomas said the plan will have ``far
more effect on the drinking water system than any rule we have ever
put up.''
   It also could cost some consumers, those served by small water
treatment plants, up to $367 a year. Most consumers could expect
much smaller increases of between $10 and $30 annually.
   While environmentalists said they support any step that will
reduce lead in drinking supplies, they said EPA's proposal does not
address the problem of lead contamination from the pipes that carry
water from the plant to the consumer's tap.
   Marion Sills of the Environmental Defense Fund, a lobbying
group, said EPA's proposals were a ``good first tier,'' but they
don't provide enough protection. If EPA's solutions fail to
eliminate the lead at the consumer's tap, there is little than can
be done, she said.
   ``The proposal constitutes an abdication of EPA's responsibility
for ensuring that Americans can turn on their faucets and receive
drinking water free from harmful levels of lead,'' said Stephanie
Pollack of the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation of New
England.
   Concentrations of lead in the blood have been associated with a
variety of health problems. Lead can impair mental ability in
children, cause premature births and delay physical and mental
development of babies. In adults it can interfere with hearing and
increase blood pressure, and, at high levels, cause kidney damage
and anemia.
   Under EPA's plan:
   _Water plant operators would be required to begin a corrosion
control program by treating water with chemicals if water at the
consumer's tap has lead levels greater than 10 parts per billion.
The program also would be required for acidic water.
   Lead often enters water _ particularly acidic or corrosive water
_ after it leaves the treatment plant. Acidity is an indicator of
corrosive water, which causes pipes to leach lead before it reaches
the tap. Thomas said there is a ``dramatic reduction'' in lead if
the acidity of the water is reduced.
   _If the average lead levels are greater than 10 parts per
billion, water suppliers must conduct a public education program,
which would include helping consumers have their water tested.
   Some consumers might have to pay to have lead pipes, which the
U.S. banned two years ago, replaced in their homes. They also may
have to allow water to run from the tap for a time before drinking.
   _Water treatment plants would have to reduce lead to a maximum
contaminant level of 5 parts per billion. Lead in source water
supplies is less of a problem than lead collected in pipes.
   Environmentalists had hoped to see stiffer maximum contaminant
levels on water at the consumer's tap. Currently, the law says the
levels must be no higher than 50 parts per billion.
   But Thomas and other EPA officials said regulating contaminant
levels was too complicated. So the new proposals, if they become
law, will supersede the contaminant level requirement.
   Before the EPA puts the regulations into effect, officials must
advertise them and solicit comment.
   Congress has given the government a deadline of June 1989 to do
something about lead levels. In 1986, Congress amended the Safe
Drinking Water Act to deal with lead.

<TEXT>
   A new law authorizing reparations for
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II helps lift ``an
unjust burden of shame'' borne by 120,000 loyal citizens for four
decades, says a congressman who was among those incarcerated.
   ``Today is a moment of great emotion for me, a day when hopes
and dreams have become reality,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta,
D-Calif., as President Reagan signed the bill Wednesday.
   The bill authorizes tax-free payments of $20,000 to each of the
approximately 60,000 surviving veterans of wartime camps, many of
whom spent three years in internment.
   The Japanese-Americans were rounded up and sent to the camps
under an order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941, plunged
the United States into World War II. Many Japanese-Americans
lobbied for the legislation for years. It finally cleared Congress
by a 257-156 vote in the House on Aug. 4.
   Reagan originally objected to some features of the bill, saying
it would be too costly, but he backed the final version which calls
for a fund of $1.2 billion, with appropriations in any one year
limited to $500 million. Legislation providing the actual money
must still be enacted.
   In signing the bill, Reagan said, ``What is most important in
this bill has less to do with property than with honor. For here we
admit a wrong. Here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal
justice under the law.''
   Mineta, who as a child of 10 was taken to an internment camp in
Wyoming, said, ``Today the unjust burden of shame which 120,000
loyal Americans have carried for 46 painful years has at long last
been lifted.''
   Many of the 250 Japanese-Americans who attended the signing
ceremony said it is the principle of the bill, not the money, that
matters.
   Among them were six members of one family _ now scattered in
California, Georgia and Oregon _ who were taken from a farm near
Stockton, Calif., to an internment camp at Rohr, Ark.
   Dr. Walter Emori, now 47 and an arthritis specialist in Medford,
Ore., was 3 when the family was interned.
   ``We see this as a healing process which says the country
recognizes that a wrong was being done and in one small way perhaps
is trying to make amends for this,'' Emori said.
   ``In general, the Japanese-American people who went to camp
recognize that it was an awful, hysterical, grim time in American
history, and although we all feel badly that we had to go and that
we were rounded up and not only had our personal belongings but our
civil liberties taken away from us, it's kind of understandable as
to why this should happen,'' he said.
   Emori noted that his family has prospered since the war, as have
many other Japanese-Americans.
   ``We as a family would like to take this gesture the next step
further and say we'd like to give this back to the country for the
good that came out of the awful,'' he said.
   He said the family plans to use its total payments of $120,000
for such a gesture, possibly to an endowed professorship at Loma
Linda University in California, where his parents worked for years
and where all four of the children went to school. Both of Emori's
sisters have master's degrees in nursing and his brother is in
business in California. His parents live near him in Medford.
   Katherine Nunotani, 70, of San Francisco, who was sent to a camp
in Jerome, Ark., along with her elderly parents when she was 24,
agreed that the money was not important.
   ``I hope nothing like this ever happens to people in the United
States,'' she said. ``The people who deserve to get it (the money),
like my old parents, they're gone.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president always
endorsed the purpose of the bill, even though he balked at the
price tag.
   When asked whether the large number of Japanese-American voters
in California, a crucial state in the coming presidential election,
influenced Reagan's decision to sign the measure, Fitzwater said:
``No. That was not a factor.''

   An estimated 1,000 Contra rebels and
Nicaraguan civilians arrived at the Nicaraguan-Honduran border this
week, many suffering from hunger and disease, according to U.S.
diplomats and rebel leaders.
   State Department cables said U.S. diplomats who visited the
Honduran side of the border Monday reported that the new arrivals
were in ``appalling condition.''
   The documents were made available to The Associated Press as
Congress considers proposals for providing additional aid to the
rebels.
   The Senate, on a 49-47 vote Wednesday evening, approved a
Democratic plan to provide $27 million in humanitarian aid to the
Contras who are opposed to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government. Senate Republicans, who had sought military as well as
humanitarian assistance, voted against the proposal as a bloc.
   According to the State Department cables, many of the newly
arriving refugees were barefoot because their boots had fallen
apart during the long trek through mountainous country in
Nicaragua, and the clothing of some was in tatters.
   Enrique Bermudez, a member of the rebel directorate, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday from Honduras that of the 1,000
Nicaraguans, 250 were rebel fighters and 750 were civilians.
   The cables said the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which is responsible for managing the humanitarian aid program,
undertook an emergency airlift program to the border area this week
to assist the new arrivals.
   Diplomats attached to the U.S. Embassy in Honduras said in the
cables that a ``human crisis of major proportions may be under
way'' along the Coco River, which separates the two countries.
   Congress approved $17.7 million in humanitarian aid to the
Contras in late March. But because of congressional restrictions
and restraints written into a cease-fire agreement signed by the
Contras and the Sandinistas last March, the bulk of that assistance
has been sent to camps on the Honduran side of the border, rather
than into Nicaragua itself. Thousands of rebels have retreated to
the border area in recent months.
   U.S. diplomats dispatched to the scene ``tell of famished people
tearing into crates of emergency foodstuff,'' one cable said.
   However, the cables gave no indication of how many of those who
arrived at the border were suffering from hunger or disease.
   Contra sources reported numerous cases of mountain leprosy,
malaria and parasitic infection among the latest arrivals. They
said at least 10 members of the group died en route.
   An additional 2,000 Nicaraguans were reported en route to the
border area and may be in ``an even more appalling condition'' than
those who arrived this week, according to one cable.
   Another cable said U.S. assistance facilities may be overwhelmed
if the additional Nicaraguans arrive soon.
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra political directorate,
said Wednesday that there are about 9,000 rebels in the border area
and about 2,500 deep inside Nicaragua.
   In the telephone interview, Bermudez declined to provide figures
but said that 65 percent of the rebels are along the border and 35
percent in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Three Months' Rent For A One-Month Apartment; $3,000 For A Week In
A House</HEAD>

   Carol Wilkerson scandalized her mother by
renting her house for $2,500 during the week of the GOP national
convention.
   ``She said, `Republicans? You're renting your house to
REPUBLICANS?'
   ``My mother's a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat from New York,'' said
Mrs. Wilkerson.
   Actually, the house is being rented by a small Washington, D.C.,
communications company for two couples and two single women who
will install and maintain phone lines in the Superdome during the
convention there, Mrs. Wilkerson said.
   The company _ she couldn't recall its name _ is one of many
renting houses or apartments during the convention Aug. 15-18.
   Most apartments are being rented to the news media, leasing
specialists say.
   The CBS and NBC television networks have rented about 30
apartments for their staffs in luxury complexes converted from
warehouses within walking distance of the Superdome, said Brenda
Boettner, leasing director at Downtown Locators.
   Although the apartments are leased for a month, the networks are
paying three months' rent _ $3,240 for one bedroom and $4,590 for
two _ because the company won't accept shorter corporate rentals,
she said.
   Downtown Locators has to rent furniture, buy sheets and dishes
and otherwise make the apartment ready to live in immediately, she
noted.
   ``The biggest task is gathering individual pieces _ flower
pieces, pots and pans, Corelle dishes,'' said Carol Rockhold,
representative for corporate apartments at Tonti Management Corp.
   She said her recent 80-hour weeks often have included 12 hours a
day spent driving to various discount houses to find all of the
little things that go into furnishing a corporate apartment.
   She wouldn't say who was renting from Tonti, other than that
most were electronic support people for the news media, or what
they were paying.
   But she did say she had rented more than 200 apartments in
suburban Metairie for the convention. Most of the tenants came
after the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta ended July 22,
she said.
   Mrs. Wilkerson's tenants are coming Friday.
   She said she used their rent check to get some renovation done
before they arrived.
   ``We had the whole house repainted, replastered, and we're
getting new drapes,'' she said. ``It's great. The house is 100
years old and there's always work to do. But the economy has been
bad in New Orleans and we'd been putting the work off.''
   She said several of her friends also are renting their houses
for the week. One of them, Lydia Montgomery, said the $3,000 she's
getting also will go into the house.
   ``I've got a bedroom that I've been wanting to redo. ... And
there are curtains I've been wanting to have done. And we'll be
able to go out to eat a couple of nights,'' she said.
   Both women are giving their tenants some personal service.
   ``We're going to leave a list of restaurants, and all the
neighbors will come down and introduce themselves.... A friend of
mine makes gumbo, and I'm going to leave them dinner for the first
night. And they're going to go to the neighborhood watering hole
and put their first drink on our tab,'' said Mrs. Wilkerson.
   Mrs. Montgomery, who made $1,500 renting rooms to six couples
during the 1986 Super Bowl, said her children don't care for such
deals.
   ``I have two daughters. Nineteen and 23. They're both mortified
when I do this,'' she said.

<HEAD>Air Force Admits It's Unhappy With Attempts To Fix B-1B's Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is unhappy with its attempts to
fix problems on the B-1B bomber, and the service is trying to find
a new method to improve the plane's capability to avoid enemy
defenses.
   The admission came Wednesday as the service replied to the
latest criticism from Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee and one of Congress' leading critics of
the bomber.
   The problem concerns the B-1B's electronic counter-measures,
which is the complex computer-driven system designed to help the
long-range atomic bomber outwit Soviet air defenses.
   By June, the Air Force said, the service ``determined that work
was behind schedule and the solutions being pursued would not
provide for the full ECM system maturity the Air Force desired.''
   While some ECM problems have been fixed, ``progress has not been
satisfactory and the management of the ECM system has not met our
expectations. We are currently working out the most appropriate
action in the face of those facts,'' the Air Force said in a
statement.
   Aspin renewed his criticism, this time in a letter to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and a speech he planned to deliver
today on the House floor.
   There are ``major questions about the B-1B's future,'' he said.
``Is it really worth it to spend any more money on the B-1B?
   ``We have a very serious problem on our hands,'' said Aspin.
``If a case cannot be made for the B-1B, I do not see how we can
spend any more money on it.''
   The Rockwell-built bomber was killed by President Carter in
1977, but President Reagan reversed that decision four years later
and approved the purchase of 100 of the planes for $27.3 billion.
All 100 planes have been built.
   Reagan said the B-1 was needed to replace the aging B-52s in the
nation's long-range bomber arsenal until the ``stealth'' bomber
becomes available. That plane, named after its intended capability
to evade enemy radar, will be rolled out publicly for the first
time in November.
   In the past two years, the B-1 has run into a series of highly
publicized problems. The Air Force said many of those problems were
the sort normally found in new planes.
   But solving the ECM problem is not so easy, the service admitted.
   Aspin asked Carlucci to tell Congress how much it will cost to
improve the B-1B, whether the additional money will provide
additional capability, and how the plane's mission can be changed
if the money isn't spent.
   Unless the questions are answered, said Aspin, ``We may well be
faced with the prospect of parking the B-1B.''
   He suggested that perhaps the money which would be used for the
plane could be used better for other long-range atomic weapons,
such as land-based nuclear missiles.
   From now until 2004, the United States will spend a projected
total of $425 billion for strategic weapons, and $242 billion of
that total, or 57 percent, will go for bombers, he said.
   ``We need to ask ourselves if this money would not be better
spent on systems that do not have as many uncertainties as the B-1B
program,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: The White House's Candidate for Bush's Job</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the White House as elsewhere, Vice
President George Bush's search for a running mate has people
guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game.
   President Reagan says he's just guessing along with everybody
else.
   ``I don't have a candidate,'' he said Wednesday when asked about
it. ``That's up to him.''
   Reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting his
national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, as a
possibility for the second spot on the ticket. Powell is the first
black ever to hold the post of national security adviser.
   ``You'd better watch out,'' the president quipped. ``He's
standing right behind you.''
   Powell, stationed behind the group of reporters who were
questioning Reagan during an Oval Office photo opportunity, made no
comment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of
Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, ``Colin Powell is a
great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any
position. I hope he's listening to this.''
   Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top
White House aides.
   Later, as Reagan bade farewell to visiting Icelandic Prime
Minister Thorsteinn Palsson in the White House East Room, the
question came up again.
   Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a
reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, ``He's
my candidate.''
   Powell just grinned and shook his head but said nothing.
   Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and
Powell was his deputy.
   The most recent thing Powell has said about his future was in a
speech to the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles on July 19.
   ``As for myself,'' he said, ``I expect to go back to a nice
quiet foxhole where I can serve my country in a more comfortable
and perhaps less exposed position.''
   Powell is an army officer and, before becoming Carlucci's deputy
in January 1987, was commanding General of V Corps in Frankfurt,
West Germany.
   The questions about his future were spurred by a column in
Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it
would be a ``brilliant idea'' for Bush to pick Powell as his
running mate.
   Despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers, it's not
just a joke.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice
presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as
a possible Bush running mate.
   The congressman's press secretary, Marci Robinson, said Kemp
believes Powell would be ``an exciting choice'' with the foreign
affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if
necessary and that ``politically speaking, it would hit the
Democrats at their strength.''
   Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as
even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although
former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under
consideration.
   Fitzwater was asked jokingly whether he is interested.
   ``I`m available,'' he replied to laughter. ``I ought to get the
honesty vote. I say it right up front _ I will be vice president.
Just ask. I never disparaged the job. I thought it was terrific
when I was on the staff.''
   Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking his present
job.

<HEAD>$2.5 Billion Child Care Bill Ready For Action on House, Senate
Floors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riding the momentum of the political season, a
$2.5 billion child care bill is progressing through Congress
despite unresolved controversies over religion, money, federal
regulation and other fundamental issues.
   The Act for Better Child Care Services, or ABC bill, won
approval on a 19-14 vote Wednesday in the House Education and Labor
Committee. The vote puts the bill in line for floor action in both
the House and the Senate, where a committee approved it last month.
   While senators have agreed to at least try to iron out their
differences before bringing ABC to the floor, most if not all of
the controversies aired in the House panels that considered the
bill are expected to arise again on the House floor.
   Both versions of the bill authorize $2.5 billion next year for
states to improve day care, expand it and make it more affordable.
Three-quarters of the money would be used to help low- and
moderate-income families pay for child care either through vouchers
or direct payments to providers.
   While most of the money would go to the working poor, states
theoretically could give some help to households earning up to 115
percent of the state's median income _ over $40,000 in some places.
   Committee Democrats beat off two attempts to lower the income
eligibility level, citing political reasons, among others.
   ``In this Congress, programs for poor people do not fare nearly
as well as programs that appear to benefit the middle class,'' said
Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. ``By keeping open the possibility of
help to the middle class, we'll get the kind of support a fledgling
program like this needs to survive.''
   The only significant amendment accepted Wednesday lowered the
age level of eligible children from 15 to 12. Attempts to lower it
to 7 and 10 failed.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, leading the Republican onslaught against
the ABC bill, claimed it would raise unrealistic expections,
discriminate against families with a parent at home, and reduce the
supply of day care by imposing federal regulations. Tauke has
introduced a rival bill revolving around family tax credits and day
care vouchers.
   He and others failed in attempts to eliminate the ABC
requirement for a commission to develop minimum federal health,
safety and training standards. The standards would be mandatory for
those day care homes and centers accepting the federal aid.
   Church-state relations are another stumbling block. As
introduced, the ABC bill would have allowed federal funds to
church-based day care centers only if they did not promote
religion. They also would have had to comply with federal bans on
religious discrimination in hiring and admissions.
   The version passed by the House committee says only day-care
slots paid for by the federal government would have to be available
to all children regardless of religion. The ban on hiring
discrimination was dropped.
   Committee Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said in a
statement after the vote Wednesday that while he would ``prefer
more precise language ensuring that religious indoctrination will
not occur, I support the current language at this time in order to
move the bill forward.''
   He added, ``I want to make clear that as a general proposition,
all persons should have equal access to day care programs supported
in whole or in part by federal financial assistance.''
   Other Republican objections centered on the cost of the bill.
Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, proposed authorizing $100 billion for ABC
rather than $2.5 billion _ to reflect what he called the bill's
real price tag.
   ``We're talking about megabucks,'' he said, ``a fiscal time
bomb.'' He was voted down.
   Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., was the only Republican to vote in
favor of the bill Wednesday. Two Democrats, Pat Williams of Montana
and Tim Penny of Minnesota, voted no.

   A House subcommittee chairman whose panel is
probing a disastrous Carrollton, Ky., school bus crash is accusing
a federal safety agency of being too passive on improving the
safety of the vehicles.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration on Wednesday is paying a ``lack of
attention'' to school bus safety.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee's transportation
subcommittee, which Luken heads, was examining the May 14 accident
in which 27 bus occupants were killed when the vehicle was hit
head-on by a pickup truck going in the wrong direction.
   All the deaths have been attributed to smoke inhalation, caused
by a fire that engulfed the bus after the collision.
   ``NHTSA has never issued a specific standard for flammability
for school buses,'' Luken said.
   Instead, he said, the agency relies on regulations adopted in
the 1970s.
   ``Other safety agencies, such as the Federal Aviation
Administration, have issued more stringent flammability
standards,'' he said.
   NHTSA Administrator Diane K. Steed told Luken that her agency
has focused on preventing the ejection of passengers from buses in
accidents. The Kentucky crash was the first in which school bus
occupants were killed from a fire, she said.
   ``In view of the much higher risk of impact injury compared to
the risk of fire injury, the agency concluded that it was more
important to preserve the superior impact protection for the
children,'' as long as materials met basic flammability standards,
she said.
   At the same session, Steed estimated that about one-fourth of
the nation's 350,000 school buses were built before the government
issued rules in 1977 stiffening safety standards for the vehicles.
   The bus involved in the Kentucky crash was built three weeks
before the federal safety requirements took effect on April 1,
1977, and did not conform with all of the government standards. The
rules covered buses manufactured after April 1, 1977.
   The requirements covered the use of energy-absorbing materials;
stronger seats, roofs and body joints; more accessible exits; and
improvements to the impact resistance of fuel systems.
   The driver of the pickup truck that smashed into the bus, Larry
Mahoney of Worthville, Ky., has been charged with 27 counts of
murder and with drunken driving.
   James and Karolyn Nunnallee, whose 10-year-old daughter, Patty,
was killed in the crash, told the subcommittee the federal
government has to improve its efforts to control drunken driving.
   ``The federal government has the resources and the capability to
not only assist the states but to force the states to do something
about the drunk driving menace,'' Karolyn Nunnallee said.

   House and Senate leaders would like to put the
finishing touches on a bill providing emergency infusions of money
to several federal programs whose coffers are running low.
   The Senate voted its approval Wednesday evening for a 1988
supplemental spending measure that would disperse $633 million in
new spending among a handful of agencies, including the Veterans
Administration and the Justice Department.
   That means that a compromise bill has to be worked out because
the House approved a $189 million version of the bill on July 27
that distributed the funds differently.
   Aides from the two chambers began meeting Wednesday, even before
the Senate passed the legislation, to begin ironing out differences
between the two bills. With Congress planning to begin a nearly
four-week summer vacation after business ends today, lawmakers were
hoping that a compromise bill could be fashioned and approved
before going home.
   Both bills were labeled ``dire emergency'' supplemental spending
measures, a legacy of last fall's budget summit agreement between
President Reagan and congressional leaders.
   In agreeing to that pact, the parties agreed that the only extra
spending that would be sought for fiscal 1988 _ which ends Sept. 30
_ would be for ``dire emergencies.'' Normally, supplemental
spending bills become laden with pet projects that lawmakers have
been unable to attach to other measures.
   Some legislators are hoping a second supplemental spending bill,
which already has cleared the House Appropriations Committee, will
be enacted later this year.
   The biggest difference between the bills passed by the House and
Senate was over spending on veterans' programs. The Senate measure
contained $530 million in new and transferred funds to help the
Veterans Administration pay for higher benefits, a growing caseload
and medical treatment, while the House bill had no such money.
   The House bill, on the other hand, had $50 million to keep some
state unemployment programs running and $24 million to help
refugees from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Africa and
Southeast Asia. The Senate removed money for the refugees.
   Both bills contain $49 million for workers who have lost their
jobs because of foreign imports, $43 million for some recipients of
federal black lung benefits and $60 million for the Coast Guard to
keep its air and sea patrols operating.
   The two measures also include aid for the Justice Department to
pay for expenses of last year's uprising by Cuban detainees in
prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., for the Agriculture Department
to pay for some expenses caused by the drought and for the Small
Business Administration to disburse disaster loans.
   The Senate bill could have been approved a week ago, but it was
delayed as Democrats and Republicans tried unsuccessfully to forge
an agreement on aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   The Senate passed its spending bill only after majority
Democrats, on a 57-39 vote, defeated a GOP plan to funnel military
aid to the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.

   Republicans dispensed with a bitter
delegation fight and turned back a request to make the party
structure more open to minorities as they cruised toward next
week's convention with sharpened attacks on the Democrats.
   ``When I look up there and don't see a black face, I get
suspicious,'' Lugenia Gordon, a 67-year-old black Republican from
New York City, told the Republican National Committee on Wednesday.
   ``It seems to me that the Republican Party looks at us like
Limburger cheese _ a little bit of us goes a long way,'' said Ms.
Gordon, who was speaking on behalf of an appeal from a group
calling itself Freedom Republicans that urged the party to include
more minorities in the party structure.
   The RNC rejected the proposal.
   RNC Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. sought to focus the party's
attacks on the Democrats, saying they have no right to get upset
over Republican criticism.
   Fahrenkopf cited George Bush's appearance ealier in the week
before the GOP platform committee when the vice president referred
to Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as ``the stealth candidate''
and said the Massachusetts governor was invisible on the issues.
   ``Dukakis is already crying foul,'' Fahrenkopf said in a speech
to the RNC, which was meeting less than a week before the party's
national convention. ``But how can Dukakis call this negative
campaigning and go unchallenged?
   ``Yes, the vice president's remarks were critical. ... But the
vice president used a memorable rhetorical device to make a point
grounded in fact _ that Dukakis will not discuss the issues,'' he
said.
   Also on Wednesday, the committee settled a bitter six-month
fight in Georgia, where two groups wrestled for control of the
state's 48-member delegation to the national convention.
   In the end, a faction that included supporters of television
evangelist Pat Robertson along with dissident party members won a
majority of the state's delegation, even though all Georgia
delegates are obliged to vote for Bush.
   On the other side were party regulars, who were outraged at a
settlement imposed on them by the national committees and approved
by the national campaigns of Bush and Robertson.
   Georgia GOP Chairman John Stuckey, who was on the losing side,
left for home Wednesday, saying he would not return to claim his
seat as a convention delegate next week and would not rule out the
possibility of resigning his state party post.
   Asked if the Bush campaign had leaned on him to accept an
agreement, Stuckey replied, ``No, they fell on me.''
   Negotiators included Rich Bond, deputy manager of the Bush
campaign, and Mark Nuttle, who had been manager of the Robertson
campaign.
   ``We are striving to get our family together on this and aim our
fire at Michael Dukakis and not at each other,'' Bond said.
   However, Stuckey said he doubted the settlement would achieve
party harmony in Georgia.
   ``If the object of this exercise is to buy peace, it will have
the same effect as Mr. (Neville) Chamberlain ... to buy peace,''
said Stuckey, referring to the former British prime minister's
attempt to negotiate peace with Nazi Germany before World War II.

   Actor Rex Harrison received mixed reviews for his
first London stage performance in four years, ``The Admirable
Crichton.''
   ``He has now become a gently feathery presence who potters
benignly about with little of the tenor bark that was once his
trademark,'' Michael Billington wrote Wednesday in The Guardian.
   Harrison is cast in J.M. Barrie's 1902 play as the Earl of Loam,
a social ``radical'' who believes in reversing the class
relationship between his own wealthy family and the servants they
employ.
   ``The production's sleepy course probably is the consequence of
casting Rex Harrison,'' Jeremy Kingston wrote in The Times of
London.
   Michael Coveney in The Financial Times was one of several
critics to note that the actor ``can barely deliver a speech
without stumbling.''
   Harrison, 80, is best known for playing Henry Higgins in the
musical ``My Fair Lady.''

   Not to be left out of the lucrative namesake
perfume business, Cher has joined Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor
and Gloria Vanderbilt in launching her own line of fragrance,
``Cher _ Uninhibited.''
   ``Uninhibited means something different to every one of us. ...
It can suit every woman's idea of fantasy,'' Cher told reporters
Wednesday at the Plaza Hotel, adding that her own definition might
be ``running naked through the park.''
   Cher, who wore a black, skin-tight, off-the-shoulder minidress
by Bob Mackie, said she tried out ``Uninhibited'' on friends during
the testing, and her boyfriend, Robert Camilletti, ``actually,
finally liked it.''
   Michael Stern, president of Parfums Stern, said the fragrance
will be available about Nov. 1. Prices will range from $30 for a
1.7-ounce eau de toilette spray to $300 for a 1.7-ounce ``deluxe
perfume presentation.''

   Comedian Jay Leno and his Big Dog Productions
Co. have sued the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc. for
failing to release Leno's film debut, ``Collision Course.''
   Leno claims that De Laurentiis' failure to release the movie
after Leno had plugged it on national television, including ``The
Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' resulted in a ``loss of
confidence and credibility with the television viewing audience
upon whom Leno is reliant.''
   The $3 million suit, filed Tuesday in Superior Court, also says
Leno was to receive more than $1 million each for two addition De
Laurentiis films that were scheduled.
   Mark Baron, a De Laurentiis' executive vice president, said
Wednesday the studio had not seen the suit and had no comment.
   ``Collision Course'' was due for release in January, but De
Laurentiis' financial difficulties prevented it, Baron said.

   Attorney Melvin Belli, fighting a
government tax claim of up to $3 million, says he legitimately sold
his office building to his son, who took three years to record the
transaction.
   The famed trial lawyer, who also faces heated divorce
proceedings with his wife, Lia, told reporters Wednesday the
Internal Revenue Service claim against him was ``a goddamn lie.''
   Belli must prove that his transfer of his law office building to
his son, Caesar, was a sale and not a gift. Large gifts are taxed
against the giver at a higher rate than the capital gains tax on a
sale of real estate.
   The IRS calls the sale a sham, noting that the $9,000 a month
Caesar was to have paid for the building was exactly offset by the
amount his father was charged to rent his office.
   In a related case, the IRS is seeking more than $300,000 in back
income taxes and penalties against Melvin and Lia Belli.

   Actor Mr. T and the contractor he hired
to remodel his home have agreed to drop lawsuits against each other.
   Mr. T, the tough guy in the ``A Team'' series now in
syndication, hired contractor Kenneth Tomkins in 1987 for a
$170,000 remodeling of his luxurious home in this north Chicago
suburb. Included were new fencing and security gates, interior
decorating and improvements to 10 bathrooms.
   But Mr. T fired Tomkins before the project was completed, and
hired a different contractor to finish. He sued Tomkins in Lake
County Circuit Court for $200,000, contending their contract wasn't
fulfilled satisfactorily.
   Tomkins countersued, saying the actor owed him $18,000.
   But on Tuesday, Mr. T and Tomkins left the courtroom with their
attorneys before testimony began. About an hour later, their
attorneys returned and announced a settlement. They did not
disclose the terms.
   ``Both of them seemed real pleased with the agreement and we all
had a nice lunch together,'' said Tomkins' attorney, James Ryan.

   TV weatherman Willard Scott hopes to ease
the disappointment of the residents of St. Marys after a woman
falsely led them to believe that he planned to visit the tiny
coastal community.
   A spokesman for NBC in New York said Scott, the genial ``Today''
show weatherman who often gives his forecasts from remote sites,
will try to spend a day in the town in November talking to
residents, though he will not be able to appear on the air from St.
Marys.
   ``It's definitely in response to that unfortunate incident,''
spokesman John Bianchi said Tuesday. ``Willard felt bad, so he said
to try to work out the details because he didn't want to disappoint
the folks down there.''
   Last month, a woman who claimed she was from NBC came to town to
made plans for Scott and newsman John Palmer to visit. The woman,
who stayed 10 days, suddenly checked out of her motel Aug. 2 and
has not been seen since. ``Today'' spokeswoman Kathy Graham said
the woman does not work for NBC.

   Author William Cox, who specialized in
paperback sagas dramatizing life in the Old West, died at his
typewriter while writing his 81st novel, his widow said. He was 87.
   Cox died at his home here Sunday of congestive heart failure,
said his wife, Casey.
   Cox's last entry on his unfinished novel ``Cemetery Jones and
the Tombstone Wars,'' came Sundayand read: ``He felt a surge of
hitherto unknown ambition. He could be as hard and he sure was
tougher than Old Man Clanton,'' said Mrs. Cox.
   In addition to his 80 novels, Cox wrote about 1,000 short
stories, 100 television scripts and screenplays. His efforts ranged
from newspaper sports stories to popular pulp tales for ``dime
magazines'' in the 1920s and 1930s.
   ``Writing was just one of those things that he did,'' Mrs. Cox
said. `He'd have a plot in his mind for days. Then he'd get in a
fit, go into his study, and just write.''
   Cox wrote screenplays for two films, ``Veils of Bagdad'' and
``Tanganyika'' in the mid-1950s.
   Later, he focused on writing Westerns, including ``The Six
Horsemen,'' ``Chicano Cruz,'' and the ``Cemetery Jones'' series.
   Survivors include his wife, and stepson, Douglas Campbell.
Funeral services will be private.

<HEAD>Iranian Envoy Says Iraqi Overflights Could Endanger Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's U.N. ambassador complained that
Iraqi warplanes have buzzed Iranian cities and warned that more
such flights could jeopardize a truce to end eight years of war.
   In Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's acting commander-in-chief Hashemi
Rafsanjani said a U.N. inquiry must condemn Iraq as the aggressor
in the Persian Gulf war or the region will face grave consequences.
   Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati met U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday to lodge a protest, saying
Iraqi planes had broken the sound barrier swooping down on several
Iranian cities.
   Perez de Cuellar, who has been trying to negotiate and end to
the conflict, announced Monday that both sides have agreed to an
Aug. 20 cease-fire date with direct talks to begin five days later
in Geneva.
   There have been no reports of fighting since.
   After meeting with the U.N. cheif, Mahallati told reporters that
Iraqi overflights ``can be a dangerous opening.
   ``If it (the overflights) would be continued, I am afraid that
it is an obstacle in the way of the secretary-general carrying out
his task,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar said of the alleged overflights:
   ``I am persuaded that if something happened, it was kind of a
mistake, a technical mistake, a misunderstanding.''
   Tehran Radio reported the Iraqi flights over southwestern Iran
on Wednesday. Iraqi media reported no air force activity, and there
was no independent confirmation of any overflights.
   A member of the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations said there
would be no comment on Mahallati's remarks until today. He declined
to give his name.
   In Tehran, Rafsanjani, also the speaker of parliament, said Iran
wants ``justice and punishment of the aggressor who has violated
all principles'' of international law.
   He spoke at an international conference organized by Iran to
discuss ``aggression and defense.''
   The year-old U.N. cease-fire resolution that Iran finally
accepted last month calls on the secretary-general to set up an
impartial body to judge who started the war.
   ``We have accepted the resolution with the hope that on the
committee determining the responsibility of the aggressor, they
(the United Nations) are serious,'' Rafsanjani said. ``We hope
events do not take place that make us think they have told us lies.
   ``If we have such a feeling, this might have grave consequences
for the region.'' He did not elaborate.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian U.N. mission in Geneva, said
Iran wants compensation for aggression in the war but gave no
details. Official Iranian estimates put war damage at $350 billion.
   Also on Wednesday, small groups of U.N. officials arrived in
Tehran and Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, to prepare for hundreds of
military observers who will monitor the cease-fire.
   All 350 observers from 25 countries are expected to be in place
within a week, the officials said.
   The U.N. Security Council met Wednesday in informal
consultations to approve the secretary-general's list of nations
sending cease-fire monitors.
   The nations are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India,
Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,
Poland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.
   Earlier in the day, the United States called on Arab nations and
Japan to donate money to the peacekeeping group.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We
do intend to urge the (Persian) gulf states, who are the chief
beneficiaries of this settlement, to share in the cost through
voluntary contributions.
   ``We'll be giving the same message to other countries like Japan
and others who have an interest in the gulf,'' he said. Japan
imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region.
   Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said of the body's
financial problems, ``if we continue at this rate,'' the United
Nations will be bankrupt before October.
   The General Assembly will reconvene in a special session Tuesday
to assess its 159 members for the $74 million that the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group will cost in its first six months.
   The United States expects to be assessed about $23 million of
that amount, said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in
Washington.
   The United States is the most delinquent contributor to the
U.N.'s regular budget, accounting for $467 million of the $602
million in unpaid assessments.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moses Carl Holman, the National Urban
Coalition's president for the last 20 years, has died of cancer at
Howard University Hospital. He was 69.
   The civil rights leader who also was a poet, editor and former
college English professor, died Tuesday.
   Sometimes described as a godfather of the civil rights movement,
Holman was noted for his ability to forge coalitions between
diverse groups and individuals.
   Once asked by The Washington Post to define his role, he said,
``I remember being asked by the national Conference of Mayors
(during a debate over the creation of the Department of Education),
`Does this mean that you are in charge of this?' And I said, `No,
it doesn't mean that at all. It just means I thought we might get a
few people together and take a look at where everyone stands on
this and why.'''
   Holman also was known for his exhortation to blacks to focus on
education.
   ``As black America approaches the 21st century, our capacity or
our failure to build a solid bridge ... of works will determine
whether millions of young blacks already with us or yet unborn will
cross over into the new century or fall into the abyss,'' Holman
said earlier this year.
   The Minter City, Miss., native grew up in St. Louis and was
graduated magna cum laude from Lincoln University in Jefferson
City, Mo. He received master's degrees from the University of
Chicago and Yale University.
   Holman taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia and at Lincoln
University before joining the English department at Clark College
in Atlanta, where he taught for 14 years and was active in early
civil rights agitations.
   He also was editor of the weekly Atlanta Inquirer, which
reported on civil rights activities in the South. The American
Political Science Association gave the newspaper a public affairs
reporting award in 1962.
   That year, Holman moved to Washington and became an information
officer at the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. He served as a special
assistant to the commission's staff director and as its deputy
director before becoming the Urban Coalition's second president in
1968, one year after its formation.
   He is survived by his wife Marilla, two sons Kwasi and Kwame,
all of Washington, a daughter Kinshasha Conwill of New York City, a
sister Milterre Jenkins of St. Louis and four grandchildren.

   Swimming pools in Beijing were ordered closed
today because an outbreak of conjunctivitis has reached epidemic
proportions, Chinese newspapers reported.
   The People's Daily and China Youth News said the pools would be
closed to prevent the spread of the disease, commonly known as pink
eye.
   Both reports said Beijing's Tongren Hospital was treating an
average of 700 cases a day. Neither report gave a specific number
of how many people have the ailment.
   Temperatures in Beijing have been in the 80s, and public pools
have been packed.
   A Xinhua News Agency report said some medical experts blamed the
recent muggy and rainy weather for the outbreak.
   Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the mucuous membrane that
lines the inner surface of the eyelid and the exposed surface of
the eyeball.

   Discovery's successful launch pad
test firing shows it's ``a very good bird,'' the shuttle's chief
says, but NASA has two major hurdles to clear before its first
post-Challenger manned space flight.
   Both could be resolved in the next week, and if they are,
shuttle managers are expected to set a firm launch date of late
September or early October for the crew of five astronauts.
   ``I still think we still have a shot at late September,'' Robert
Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations, said after
Wednesday's 22-second firing of Discovery's three main liquid fuel
engines.
   The remaining technical problems are the repair of a small gas
leak in Discovery's steering engine system and the final prelaunch
test of the redesigned solid fuel rocket booster that caused
Challenger's destruction 2{ years ago.
   Wednesday's firing not only tested the engines, but other
orbiter systems, countdown procedures and the launch team, which
has added several new faces since Challenger and its crew of seven
were lost in the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion.
   ``We proved it works,'' said Crippen, a 50-year-old Navy captain
who commanded the first space shuttle flight in 1981 and has been
on more shuttle flights than any other astronaut.
   ``It's a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good
bird,'' added Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management.
   The flawless firing was a spirit lifter for space workers here
who have had to overcome one problem after another since Discovery
was moved to the launch pad July 4.
   Mechanical and other difficulties had delayed the engine firing
five times, and, combined with the unresolved gas leak, pushed
Discovery's launch date off from early to late September, with
October a distinct possibility.
   Crippen said that while it would take several days to thoroughly
analyze test data, ``you can't have a major milestone like that
come out as clean as it did and not feel good about it.''
   He said the only question turned up in a preliminary look at
data was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an area where fuel
lines join the external fuel tank. He said he did not think it was
a significant problem.
   Engineers will begin concentrating on the steering system leak
early next week when they climb into Discovery's cargo bay with a
plan to cut a hole in the rear bulkhead to gain access to an engine
compartment.
   The leak is in a fitting on a vent line, and the plan is to
clamp a clamshell-like device around it and fill it with a sealing
compound. The repair is expected to take about a week.
   The fifth and final full-scale test firing of the shuttle's
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket is set for Aug. 18 at the
Morton Thiokol plant near Brigham City, Utah.
   A faulty joint in Challenger's right booster allowed flame to
escape and triggered the explosion. The joint and other booster
systems have been thoroughly redesigned.
   The rocket in the Aug. 18 test will be deliberately flawed, with
grooves, cuts and debondings introduced in critical areas like
insulation and O-ring seals.
   ``It is a significant flaw demonstration test,'' said Crippen.
``Some say there is a risk in it, but we have to test the booster
to withstand these worst-case situations.''

   Japanese-Americans who were interned or relocated from the West
Coast during World War II say they finally feel vindicated after
their country's belated apology and promise of reparations.
   President Reagan, saying ``here we admit a wrong,'' signed a
bill in Washington on Wednesday to provide $20,000 payments to each
of the estimated 60,000 surviving Japanese-Americans who were
affected by the 1942 internment order.
   Some said they planned to donate the money to charities or
memorials to the internees. Others said they would share the
tax-free cash with relatives, while some wondered whether they
would ever see the reparations.
   Many, however, said the government's apology and their restored
honor and respect for their country meant more than the money.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt's order required all people of
Japanese ancestry living in California, Oregon and Washington, and
some in Hawaii, to be relocated. It affected 120,000 people, most
of whom were taken to guarded camps in the South and interior West.
   For former internee Dorothy Shundo, the bill means she may no
longer feel she has to carry her birth certificate in her purse to
prove she's an American.
   ``I carried it for 45 years. I hope no other group of Americans
feel they have to prove their citizenship,'' she said in the Little
Tokyo district of Los Angeles. ``We now know that the Constitution
is working.''
   Ben Takeshita said the payments were symbolic but important.
   ``Twenty-thousand dollars could not begin to compensate a person
for his or her lost freedom, for the loss of property, for the loss
of livelihood, for the stigma of disloyalty,'' Takeshita said at a
news conference at the Japanese-American Citizens League in San
Francisco.
   ``But the $20,000 means that our government is sincere in its
apology. It is a token payment, yes, but it is a meaningful one,''
he said.
   William S. Naito, a Portland, Ore., businessman and civic
leader, was a 16-year-old high school sophomore when his family was
forced to abandon their Portland gift shop and move to Salt Lake
City to live with relatives. He said the bill's apology ``is
remuneration enough.''
   Naito recalled how disgraced he felt when he was forced to clean
out his locker and leave school.
   ``Everyone thought I was guilty as a saboteur, that I was a
criminal. That sort of thing should not happen in the United
States, of all countries,'' he said.
   Dr. Paul Hamada of Hood River, Ore., said the bill acknowledges
the country constitutionally erred by rounding up and holding
people who had committed no crimes.
   Hamada was 2 when his family was moved from his grandparents'
farm near Merced, Calif., to a camp at Amache, Colo., where they
lived for 2{ years. He said he probably would donate his
reparations ``to either try to perpetuate the memory of the camps,
or propagate some form of educational scholarship.''
   Naito is working with other Japanese-Americans to establish a
memorial to the internees in Portland.
   ``I would say most of the recipients will do something like that
with the money because they feel so strongly about it,'' Naito said.
   Shigeko Uno, 73, was interned with her family in Puyallup,
Wash., and later in Idaho. The Seattle resident said she might
donate the money to a nursing home and her church, but she ``won't
believe it until I see it.''
   Some may never see it.
   Under the bill's 10-year payout plan, the oldest survivors, some
in their 90s, will get paid first.
   ``If you're 64 or 65, there's no guarantee you're going to live
to 75,'' said 69-year-old Seichi Hayashida, president of the Nampa,
Idaho, chapter of the Japanese-American Citizens League.
   Some also fear the bill will revive anti-Japanese feelings.
Naito and others, however, say the vindication of the internees is
worth the risk of further racism.
   ``I think we've got to chance it and let the pieces fall where
they might,'' he said. ``I think it's important because the next
time it might be Italians, the Irish or whatever.''

   Crabride, the winner of this year's Miss
Crustacean Pageant, waddled to fame down a steamy runway and
received the coveted cucumber rind cup to the strains of _ yes _
``Here It Comes, Miss Crustacean.''
   The crab cutie, Wednesday's winner of the annual event honoring
hermit crabs in this seashore community, wore an elaborate white
bridal outfit designed by its owner, Angela Biamonte of Ocean City.
   City publicist Mark Soifer said many of the 60 other contestants
were just as imaginative, including Roger Crabbit, Michael Ducrabis
and Cling Kong Crab.
   ``After the winner received the coveted cucumber rind cup, we
all sang, `Here It Comes, Miss Crustacean,''' he said. ``Of course,
we don't really know whether the winner is a he, she or it.''
   Also Wednesday, Bonzai Junior, coached by Tony Sirer of
Branchdale, Pa., won the annual Hermit Crab Races. Bonzai crawled
out of a 3-foot circle in 17.8 seconds, beating out 231 other
entries to become ``The King of Klutz.''
   Bonzai did not break the record, which was set by the famous
``Hermie'' nine years ago with a time of 6.3 seconds.
   ``It was a very hot day for the pageant and the races,'' Soifer
said. ``I don't think it bothered the crabs, but it was hard on us
poor human beings.''

   Evelyn Flaherty didn't know it, but when
the annual commemoration of Elvis Presley's death rolled around
this year, her phone would start ringing as fast as you can say
``Elvis lives.''
   The 11th anniversary of Presley's death is Tuesday, and managers
of Graceland, the singer's former residence in Memphis, have
scheduled their regular round of events to mark the occasion.
   A brochure outlining the anniversary program listed the phone
number ELVIS-88 for fans wanting to check the schedule.
   That number, however, is to Mrs. Flaherty's home. The correct
Elvis number is ELVIS-87, the same as last year. The Elvis line
couldn't be pushed up a digit this year because that number already
was in use.
   Mrs. Flaherty said the Elvis calls started several weeks ago and
she estimated the total as ``in the dozens,'' although the
frequency has increased during the past few days.
   ``Some of them wanted to know what we thought about Elvis being
alive,'' she said Wednesday. ``We told them we didn't think he
was.''
   Todd Morgan, a spokesman for Graceland, said managers of the
residence have apologized for any inconvenience to Mrs. Flaherty.
   ``We will provide her with tickets for four to tour all of
Graceland's attractions on us, just as soon as we can get her off
the phone,'' Morgan said.

<HEAD>Soviets Have Important New Fighter Plane, Jane's Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have developed a new lightweight jet
hailed as the ``missing component'' of their air fighter force for
the 1990s, Jane's Defense Weekly reported.
   The authoritative journal said the plane might rival the
U.S.-built F-16.
   Jane's, in an issue published today, said the new MiG-35 was
flown by pilots of India's air force in May and is in an advanced
stage of development.
   The Indians apparently were told that the MiG-35 would provide a
potent combination with the larger Soviet MiG-29, already in
service with the Indian air force, Jane's said in an advance copy
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Jane's quoted unidentified Soviet officials as indicating India
would be allowed to export the MiG-35 but did not estimate a price
for the new plane.
   The magazine said the MiG-35 features a single engine, one
tailfin and an air-intake chute under the fuselage, similar to the
F-16, which is made by General Dynamics.
   Some analysts view the MiG-35, designed for both air-to-air and
air-to-ground combat, as the ``missing component in the Soviet air
force's fighter force for the 1990s,'' Jane's said.
   ``Though a vital component of the Soviet air force, the MiG-29
is a comparatively heavy and expensive fighter and too
sophisticated for the ground-attack role,'' it said.
   The MiG-29 is a twin-tailed, twin-engine interceptor similar to
the United States' F@A-18 Hornet.
   Jane's said the Soviets presented the MiG-35 to India as a
``quality component'' for any Third World air force. Several
African countries have already been briefed about the airplane, it
said.
   The F-16 proved highly successful in air-to-ground warfare after
it came into production in the 1970s. Israel made way for its 1982
invasion of Lebanon by using F-16s to wipe out Syrian
surface-to-air missile defenses in the Bekaa Valley.

   For Karl Loose, grocery shopping has
become a humiliating journey through an obstacle course of metal
barriers, which many supermarkets use to keep carts from leaving
their premises.
   ``I can't get in the store,'' said Loose, who has used a
wheelchair for seven years. ``I have to wait to ask someone to get
the manager to let me in the store. To me, that's degrading.''
   Loose and others are fighting back.
   Many states already have building code provisions that require
stores to have at least a 32-inch wide clearance at barriers, often
metal poles spaced wide enough for pedestrians to walk through but
too narrow for shopping carts.
   The problem is that those laws aren't always enforced, said
Marilyn Golden, a policy analyst for the Disability Rights,
Education and Defense Fund in Berkeley, Calif.
   ``It's amazing that that type of barrier is tolerated,'' said
Marsha Mazz, chairwoman of the Commission on Persons with
Disabilities, in Prince George's County, Md. ``It's really a
nightmare problem.''
   Loose, 39, who used to shop at a store that had locked cart
barriers, said the devices can be more than an annoyance for
wheelchair users _ they can be dangerous.
   ``Once you're in the store, they'll lock the gate again, which
means if there's an emergency, you have to wait to get out,'' Loose
said. ``It's a definite safety hazard.''
   Loose, of Pennsauken, president of the Pennsauken Committee for
the Handicapped, which campaigns for easier access to stores with
barriers, says he now does most of his shopping at a store without
gates.
   ``It's a definite statement of exclusion,'' said Colleen Fraser,
director of the New Jersey Association of County Representatives of
Disabled Persons.
   ``You cannot shop there without pre-approval. It's a problem,
generally throughout the state,'' said Ms. Fraser, who is also
director of the Union County Office on the Handicapped.
   Walt Ruball, a spokesman for the Philadelphia-based Acme Markets
Inc., said the company has replaced most of the locked cart corrals
with new designs that allow free access to wheelchairs but prevent
carts, which cost about $120 each, from being removed.
   ``Our policy is not to have cart corrals unless they're
absolutely essential,'' Ruball said. ``We don't want to
inconvenience our customers.''
   The new gates have been installed at most of Acme's 294 stores,
Ruball said. In the past five years, at least 20 antiquated gates
have been removed, he said.
   In Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York,
however, a disabled advocacy group has filed suit against an Acme
market in Lodi where the new design has been installed.
   The new design failed to take into account that most people who
sit in wheelchairs sit on cushions, which add three inches to their
height, said Steve Janick, executive director of Disabled
Information, Awareness and Living.
   The extra height prevents many wheelchair users' shoulders from
passing beneath the wedges atop the metal posts.
   ``Indeed, most of the chairs can't get through,'' Janick said.
``Under this newest design, you either get in or not at all.
There's no alternate entrance way at all.''
   The Clifton-based non-profit organization received 13 complaints
last year about the metal barriers in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and
northern Essex Counties, Janick said.
   The group has pressured several supermarkets and department
stores to keep their gates open, Janick said.
   But he said there are still many violators.
   ``Literally, what they're saying is a disabled customer is not
worth as much as a shopping cart,'' Janick said.
   The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association in Flushing, N.Y.,
encourages its 2,000 members to file complaints if they encounter
an inaccessible entrance, said Terry Moakley, an associate
executive director.
   ``It inhibits our ability to spend money,'' Moakley said. ``Our
dollars are just as green as anybody else's.''

<HEAD>Nation's Former Lowest-Paid Teacher Returns To Tiny Town To Reopen
School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McLEOD, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who made headlines five years ago as
the nation's lowest-paid teacher has returned to reopen the
one-room schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years.
   Janice Herbranson, 54, left North Dakota to teach in Texas after
the McLeod school closed in 1986. Only one student remained in the
district, and the school board decided it was not practical to keep
the building open.
   However, Herbranson said Wednesday the McLeod school would
reopen Aug. 29 with five pupils.
   ``The whole community feels that something is back to life. It's
exciting for all of us,'' said Herbranson, who was the school's
lone teacher for 16 years before it closed.
   Two of the children will be in kindergarten, two will be in
first grade and one will be in sixth grade, she said.
   The district in this community of 45 residents faced the
prospect of being dissolved if it did not reopen this year,
Herbranson said.
   Herbranson taught prekindergarten children in Progreso, Texas,
last year, and said she enjoyed the experience.
   ``I just thoroughly thought it was a great place to be,'' she
said. ``I love the Mexican-American people. I miss the kids
already.''
   Herbranson received national attention in 1983 when the National
Education Association identified her as the nation's lowest-paid
teacher. Her annual salary was $6,300 at the time.
   Herbranson was making $6,800 when the McLeod school closed. She
said she and the district have not settled on her pay for the
coming year, but it will likely be more than what she made at the
school two years ago.
   Whatever her salary is in McLeod, it will be a substantial pay
cut from her Texas job, which paid her $25,000 annually, Herbranson
said.
   Herbranson said she took the job in Texas to experience a
different culture. She was waiting for a teaching job in Alaska
when the Progreso school district recruited her through Moorhead
State University in Minnesota, where she had been taking classes.
   She still maintains part ownership in the Sand Dune Saloon in
this southeastern North Dakota town.
   Herbranson said she believes the McLeod school has a bright
future. With several preschool children in the district, the
enrollment is expected to grow, she said.
   In addition, at least three families from outside the district
have contacted her about sending their children to McLeod this
year, she said.
   Herbranson said the school's reopening is a victory of sorts for
rural one-room schoolhouses.
   ``It's a good type of education, there's no doubt in my mind,''
she said.

   Chairs that once belonged to the son of Abraham
Lincoln went on sale with other furniture, lawbooks and art in the
liquidation of the city's oldest law firm, founded by Robert Todd
Lincoln and others 116 years ago.
   When the partners of Isham, Lincoln & Beale decided in April to
dissolve the firm as part of a merger, it meant eight floors of
offices would have to be divested of furniture, equipment, lawbooks
and art _ much of it with historic connections.
   Five chairs once owned by founding partner Robert Todd Lincoln,
the son of the 16th president, have been priced at $2,000 to $2,500
apiece, said Bud Schwartz of F.E. Schwartz and Associates, which is
conducting the sale as the law firm's executor.
   Schwartz said the sale, which began Wednesday, was going
``unbelievably well. We've got 12 sales people on the floor, and we
couldn't keep up with it.''
   There's also an ornate desk, reportedly from a Scottish castle,
that once seated Robert Lincoln's partner, Edward Isham, and the
carpet that covered the office floor of a more recent partner, the
late former Gov. Richard Ogilvie.
   ``They're selling everything from the computers and law books to
whole offices,'' said spokeswoman Arlene Shattil. ``The sale will
continue until everything that can be sold is sold, which should be
at least two or three weeks.''
   The sale is by appointment only, and people with appointments
are expected to come early to view a videotape of the items being
sold. Schwartz said the tape was prepared to save the potential
customers a tour of the offices.
   Schwartz declined to discuss reasons for the dissolution except
to say the firm was going through a merger.

<TEXT>
   Domestic government programs have been cut by
a total of $158.6 billion in terms of services delivered since
President Reagan assumed office, according to a report released
today by a union of government workers.
   Federal aid to state and local governments over the past seven
years is 16.5 percent, or $123.6 billion, below what it would have
been had programs in place in 1981 been maintained at then-current
service levels, said the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   Cumulative government payments to individuals such as college
aid, Social Security and food stamps over the seven years are $35
billion less, or 2.3 percent below, what they would have totaled
had the programs been maintained at 1981 levels, the study
commissioned by AFSCME said.
   The report _ titled ``The Republican Record: A 7-Year Analysis
of State Losses of Federal Funding'' _ said the biggest cut was in
state aid to provide free or reduced-price milk to schoolchildren.
   Federal spending on the milk program has totaled $131 million
over the past seven years, or 86.2 percent below the $950 million
that would have been spent had the program been maintained at is
1981 funding level, the report said.

   The last Navy admiral still on active duty to
see combat in World War II is retiring Aug. 31 after more than 55
years of military service.
   President Reagan will honor Rear Adm. John Duncan Bulkeley by
nominating him for promotion to the three-star rank of vice
admiral, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Senate confirmation of that
promotion was virtually assured.
   Bulkeley, a Medal of Honor winner, is known within the Navy as
the officer who safely evacuated Gen. Douglas MacArthur to
Australia in March 1942 after the Japanese invaded the Philippines.
   He received the nation's highest military award for his
squadron's success in damaging or destroying Japanese planes,
warships and merchant ships while he commanded various motor
torpedo boat squadrons in the Pacific theater.
   Bulkeley has spent the last 21 years as head of the Naval Board

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call for Dissolution of Panama Canal Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional conservatives are asking fellow
lawmakers to void the treaty that shifts ownership of the Panama
Canal from the United States to the Panamanian government.
   Under the agreement ratified by the Senate in 1979, the United
States would abandon all rights to the Canal Zone and it would
become a part of Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   But a resolution introduced Wednesday contends the treaty is
invalid because the Constitution requires both the House and Senate
to approve the transfer of U.S. property.
   ``We did not participate on the House side,'' said Rep. Philip
Crane, R-Ill. ``It was a flawed treaty in terms of our
constitutional obligations.''
   Republican Sen. Steve Symms of Idaho said Congress also never
ratified changes imposed by Panama and was not signed by that
nation's president.
   Crane said the 39 initial co-sponsors include three Democrats.
``It's really not a partisan question,'' he said. ``It's an
American question, an issue of American interests and security.''

   A congressional panel has sent to the full
House a $46 million package calling for federal and state action to
combat cancer-causing radon pollution in houses and schools.
   The legislation, which cleared the Energy and Commerce Committee
by a voice vote Wednesday, would set a national goal of making the
air inside buildings as free of radon gas concentrations as the air
outside buildings.
   It would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update
and revise its ``Citizen's Guide to Radon'' to include information
about health risks posed by various indoor levels of the naturally
occurring gas.
   Health experts have warned that the EPA's current listing for
acceptable levels of radon gas is too high, allowing for the
equivalent of smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. Radon is an
colorless, odorless radioactive gas produced by the decay of
uranium deposits.

   A self-described TV addict charged with
chopping down a neighbor's 83-year-old oak tree to improve his
satellite reception hopes to get the charges erased, but his
neighbor isn't happy about the prospect.
   Arthur Anderson, 59, of Redding, told Danbury Superior Court
Judge Howard Moraghan on Wednesday that he didn't have a criminal
record and wanted to apply for the accelerated rehabilitation
program.
   Under the program, first-time offenders can have charges erased
from their records after they successfully complete probationary
periods.
   ``This isn't the crime of the century,'' Anderson's lawyer,
Jeffrey B. Sienkiewicz, told reporters. Anderson is charged with
second-degree criminal mischief and third-degree criminal trespass.
   The tree owner, Charles Marriner, 62, will be able to address
the judge he rules on Anderson's request.
   Marriner, who is suing Anderson for $37,000 in damages, said he
plans to ``give very serious thought to opposing accelerated
rehabilitation based on the fact that it was the second time he did
it.''
   Marriner said he has received letters from people as far away as
Seattle urging him to pursue prosecution of Anderson.
   ``The common thread of these letters is people are feeling very
threatened and very upset about the aberration of a person's
rights,'' Marriner said.
   In court, Moraghan asked Anderson what he had done.
   ``I cut a tree down,'' Anderson said, his voice barely audible.
   The construction worker told police in June after he cut down
the tree, ``Now I can get the Disney Channel.'' He also said he and
his wife are ``TV addicts.''
   The judge ordered a Sept. 7 court date for Anderson, who could
receive a maximum sentence of one year in prison for second-degree
criminal mischief and six months for third-degree criminal
trespassing if he is tried and convicted.
   State's Attorney Devin Stilson said he believes accelerated
rehabilitation is appropriate for Anderson because the program is
intended for crimes that are not of a serious nature.

   For every 200 words Olivia D'Amato
writes about the world's oldest profession, a judge will suspend
one day of her maximum 30-day sentence on a prostitution conviction.
   Ms. D'Amato ``was quite taken aback'' when Municipal Judge
Samuel Serata issued the sentence Tuesday, said her attorney,
Howard Kupperman.
   ``It's unusual, innovative and different. To you and I and other
literate people, it seems easy, but for her it's quite a burden,''
Kupperman said Wednesday.
   ``She could conceivably get the whole sentence suspended, but it
will be quite a challenge.''
   Ms. D'Amato has definite opinions on her profession, he said.
Before she was convicted, she told the judge that prostitution is
the world's oldest profession and that jail sentences would not
stop it, Kupperman said. She told the judge that legalizing
prostitution would probably be the best solution, he said.
   When she left the courtroom, Ms. D'Amato told Kupperman her
first priority would be to get the conviction overturned. She was
charged with soliciting an undercover police officer. Kupperman's
defense centered on the fact that Ms. D'Amato knew the officer and
would never have solicited him.
   Like Ms. D'Amato, Kupperman and City Attorney Mark Grice, who
prosecuted the case, expressed surprise at the sentence.
   ``I think it's fair,'' Grice said. ``By writing an essay, maybe
she would realize the problems in prostitution. He wants to hear
her standpoint on ways the courts can address prostitution.
   ``He was especially concerned about young girls _ girls younger
than 18 _ on the streets here in Atlantic City,'' the prosecutor
said.
   Ms. D'Amato has been arrested for prostitution elsewhere, Grice
said, including New York, California and Washington. She has been
arrested at least three times in Atlantic City, he said.
   She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

<HEAD>Bakker Says He Plans To Outbid Canadian Company For PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker says he
plans to recapture his television ministry by outbidding a Canadian
company for PTL's assets when the bankruptcy sale closes next month.
   The Canadian company, Samoth Capital Corp., has offered $113
million _ $46 million in cash immediately and the rest over five
years.
   Bakker said the Canadian offer's real value is $77 million after
discounting such things as interest that could be earned if the
money were paid to PTL immediately. He said he plans to outbid that
amount.
   PTL agreed last week to give Samoth Capital's president, Peter
Thomas of Vancouver, until Sept. 16 to decide whether he wants to
go through with the deal. Until then, PTL is free to consider other
offers.
   Thomas was scheduled to begin inspecting the property today,
said PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.
   Also today, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds was
expected to hear arguments in a dispute between The Charlotte
Observer and Bakker's attorneys.
   Bakker's attorneys are protesting the sale of Bakker's
deposition transcripts to the newspaper by a court reporter, saying
their premature release is unfair to Bakker.
   Bakker was preparing his defense in PTL's $52 million lawsuit
that charges him with grossly mismanaging the ministry and the
Heritage USA theme park at Fort Mill, S.C., he founded but left
last year after acknowledging a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn.
   Using the transcripts as its source, the Observer published an
article last week that quoted Bakker as saying he believed
thousands of internal PTL documents had been destroyed since he
resigned as president in March 1987. Ministry officials denied that.
   Reynolds appeared to agree to with Bakker and last week issued
an order protecting the release of further transcripts. The
Observer said it plans to protest the order.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, three
months after Bakker resigned. Bakker has said he wants to buy PTL's
assets, including the Heritage USA Christian retreat and the PTL
satellite TV network, and return as its leader.
   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, wouldn't provide details about
Bakker's bid, but promised that ``what money is paid will be paid
at closing, and it will be a number that will be in excess of what
we believe the present value of the Canadian deal to be.''
   They weren't specific about when the offer would be made, saying
they are still making arrangements with unidentified overseas
lenders.
   Asked why anyone would lend Bakker so much money when a federal
grand jury is investigating him for possible criminal wrongdoing,
Bakker replied: ``That's not really a problem with these people.
I'm not expecting to be indicted, anyway.''
   Benton said Wednesday that before PTL will deal with Bakker, he
must deposit a substantial amount of cash or securities to
guarantee that he has the ability to buy the assets.
   The Canadian group has deposited $50,000 and has pledged $4.95
million more as soon as it decides whether to go through with the
purchase. Bakker's offer doesn't provide for any advance deposit.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old California girl has been
reunited with her teddy bear thanks to Gov. Mike Sullivan and the
Wyoming State Museum staff.
   Katherine Hill of San Francisco was visiting the state with her
parents last month when she left her plaid bear at the museum. She
wrote Sullivan asking him to walk across the street and look for
her lost companion.
   The letter was adressed to Governor Sullivan, Lost Bear
Department, State Capitol.
   A few days later, Sullivan wrote back to say the museum staff
had located the bear and would send it to her.
   ``You wrote a very good letter,'' the governor wrote. ``I hope
you enjoyed your trip to Wyoming, and that you will come back and
visit us again some day.''
   Katherine wrote back to say thanks on a piece of paper trimmed
in hearts.
   ``I am glad that my bear is back with me. Thank you for your
nice letter. I love Wyoming. I hope that I will get to come back
some day,'' she said, adding a post script requesting a picture of
the governor.
   He sent another letter with a picture and a small Wyoming teddy
to remind Katherine of the state.
   ``I hope the Wyoming bear will be good company for your plaid
bear,'' Sullivan wrote.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters Chief Wins Parole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Teamsters President Roy L.
Williams has won a parole from his 10-year prison term as a reward
for testifying for the government in mob trials and because of his
failing health, officials said.
   Williams, who has served three years for his 1982 attempted
bribery conviction, will be paroled Jan. 13, David Dorworth, chief
analyst with the U.S. Parole Commission in Washington, D.C., said
Wednesday.
   Dorworth said Williams' release would not depend upon his
continued testimony for the government in organized-crime trials
but ``is a reward for his cooperation thus far and in consideration
of his poor health.''
   F. Russell Millin, a Kansas City lawyer representing the former
labor leader, said he told Williams about the decision Wednesday
and Williams ``heaved the biggest sigh of relief you can imagine.''
   Williams, 73, who suffers from emphysema and an enlarged heart,
is confined at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in
Springfield.
   Williams served as international Teamsters president from 1981
until he was forced to resign after his conviction for trying to
bribe former U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence
trucking deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case.
   In an attempt to have his sentence reduced, Williams, a
long-time Kansas City labor leader, started cooperating with
federal authorities investigating the mob.
   He testified during one mob trial that he had been under the
control of Nick Civella, the reputed crime boss in Kansas City at
the time, and received payoffs of $1,500 a month from Civella for
seven years until he became president of the Teamsters. He said
Civella, who has died, played a key role in his election to the
union presidency.
   Williams also testified by videotape in the federal court trial
in New York against mob figures accused of fixing his election as
Teamsters president, and that of his successor, the late Jackie
Presser.
   Mob boss Anthony ``Fat Boy'' Salerno and two co-defendants were
acquitted in May of the election-fixing charges, but Salerno and
several co-defendants were convicted of charges that they conspired
to rig bids in the construction industry.
   Wiliams' attorneys have been working for the past year to gain
his release. They contended the risk Williams incurred by
testifying should be sufficient to win parole.
   Millin said he assumed Williams would return to his farm near
Leeton upon his release.

   The Houston owner of a chain of Mexican
restaurants will second George Bush's nomination at the Republican
National Convention, again underscoring the importance of Texas in
the 1988 presidential election.
   Ninfa Laurenzo's speech will follow the main nominating address
of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Bush calls Houston his home, but Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis has said he will go all out for Texas' 29 electoral
votes and chose Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate.
   Mrs. Laurenzo, 64, said she expects to speak Spanish in part of
her 90-second speech. Dukakis speaks fluent Spanish and spoke in
the language as he addressed Hispanic-American voters in his speech
accepting the Democratic nomination.
   President Reagan, in a move Democrats criticized as an
election-year bow to the Bush campaign, this week nominated Texas
Tech University President Lauro Cavazos, a Hispanic-American, as
his new Secretary of Education.

   Some of Michigan's Republican dissidents
are rebelling against party leaders by threatening to vote against
George Bush in November.
   A handful of Republicans, led by Michigan Conservative Union
Chairman Mark Koldys, have already endorsed Libertarian
presidential candidate Ron Paul. Other GOP conservatives warn that
more disaffected Republicans may follow suit.
   Paul, a former Republican congressman from Texas, is encouraging
the conservatives with personal telephone calls to influential
members of the party's right wing.
   Harry Veryser, one of the leaders of television evangelist Pat
Robertson's Michigan campaign, got one of those calls.
   Veryser isn't jumping the GOP ship, particularly not the week
before the party's national convention, but he characterizes the
defection threat as serious.
   ``I'd say it's in the initial stages,'' he said. ``You've got a
lot of angry bees looking for a place to land. People are looking

   Few black delegates will attend the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans next week, says a
Mississippi businessman among those tapped to encourage black
voters nationwide to support the GOP
   ``It will be a lily-white convention in New Orleans compared to
what we saw in Atlanta (at the Democratic convention). It's
extremely disappointing,'' said Les Range, who was named this week
by the George Bush presidential campaign to drum up black support
for the Republican.
   Mississippi has one black among 31 GOP delegates and two black
alternates among the 31 convention alternates. By comparison, the
state's 47-member delegation to the Democratic National Convention
included 21 blacks.
   Bush should have taken a stronger stand to promote better
representation of minorities as GOP delegates, said Range, an
executive with Pro-Mark Inc.
   ``He missed out on that score. He should have made sure there
was a good balance in the delegations,'' he said.

   Three-hour cycles of contraction and expansion
in the Earth's crust were detected for months before a major
earthquake struck the Japan Sea, scientists reported today.
   Such episodes should be studied for their potential in warning
of quakes, said researcher Alan Linde.
   Linde, with coworkers at the Carnegie Institution of Washington
and researchers in Japan, presents an analysis in the British
journal Nature.
   The three-hour episodes may reflect a buildup of stress that is
released during the quake, Linde said.
   About 100 episodes were recorded in the five months before the
1983 quake, but none have appeared since the aftershocks ended,
Linde said. They may have begun earlier, but the instrument that
recorded them was not in place before that, Linde said.
   The instrument was about 50 miles southeast of the quake's
epicenter, which was off the west coast of Japan. The quake
registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.

   About 7,000 doctors at Israel's government-run

   Israel radio said the doctors were not satisfied with the

   The doctors want the program to last longer because they
estimate 45,000 people are on the waiting list.
   The doctors, whose average monthly salary is about $750, also
demand wage increases of up to 20 percent, according to the Finance
Ministry.
   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim condemned the strikers and said
the government had ``reached the limit'' on what it could give.
   ``I think there is a also limit to the doctors' torturing of the
patients,'' he said on Israel radio.

<TEXT>
   Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who was ousted three times as
president of Panama, was remembered upon his death at age 86 as a
symbol of democracy in a country dominated by the military.
   Arias died of a heart attack here Wednesday, five days short of
his 87th birthday. He had lived here in self-imposed exile.
   The Panamanian government decreed Monday a day of mourning for
Arias, the patriarch of Panamanian politics.
   The Panamanian flag will be flown at half staff for eight days
starting Monday, Arias' birthday and the day he is to be buried in
Panama City.
   Arias, whose presidential terms were ended by military coups,
arrived here in December. He feared to return to Panama because of
his opposition to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's de
facto leader.
   ``If he had gone back, the military would have killed him,''
said Roberto Dominguez, Panamanian consul to the United States and
who opposes Noriega.
   Although Arias reportedly suffered from heart trouble, he had
been in good health recently. Arias' wife, Mireya, was with him
when he died at his home, Dominguez said.
   Relatives said Arias' body will be flown to Panama City on
Friday.
   Arias was called by opposition leaders ``a great rebel'' and
``the indisputable leader'' of Panama for the past 57 years. He was
president in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for 11 days in 1968.
   The last coup led to the long domination of the Panamanian
government by the military, first under Gen. Omar Torrijos, who
died in a 1981 plane crash, then under Noriega.
   Arias, head of the Authentic Panamanian Party, narrowly lost the
1984 election to the official party's candidate. His supporters and
others accused the government of fraud. Many also felt the military
stole a 1964 electoral victory from him.
   He continued to speak out against the military, and in 1986 said
it killed opposition leader Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had accused
Noriega's government of involvement with drugs.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida this year for alleged drug
trafficking.
   Opposition leaders in Panama expressed sorrow over Arias' death.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party, said the former president represented ``the figure of a
great rebel'' who had a social conscience and was ``concerned about
those who have less and for those who suffer more.''
   Guillermo Endara, undersecretary of the Authentic Party, said
Arias was ``the indisputable leader'' of Panama for the past 57
years.
   Carlos Ivan Zuniga, president of the Popular Action Party, said,
``There is no doubt that his death is going to constitute a
tremendous uncertainty, leave a vacuum.''
   Born when Panama was still part of Colombia, Arias was educated
in the United States and became active in his new nation's politics
in 1931, when he helped engineer a coup against the president.
   He later served as ambassador to France and England, and in
Europe became enamored of Mussolini's fascism. He returned to
advocate it in Panama, and was elected president in 1940.
   The United States, worried about his connections to the Axis
powers on the eve of World War II, encouraged a military coup
against him. But he returned to power with more moderate views in
1948, and is credited with founding his nation's highly regarded
social security system.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two museum security guards have been sentenced to
prison for illegally detaining and seriously beating a college
student with a cattle prod, an official newspaper reported today.
   The People's Daily said the Guiyang City Intermediate Court in
southern China's Guizhou province sentenced guard Chen Wei to 2
years in prison and guard Shun Li to 1{ years for the attack.
   The report said the incident occurred on June 18 when a
temporary worker at the provincial museum tried to stop Zou Zuen, a
student from Guizhou People's University, from entering a room at
the museum, saying he smelled of alcohol.
   When Zou protested, the two security guards dragged him to their
office, handcuffed him to an iron bed and beat him with a cattle
prod, the paper said.
   They also forced Zou to kneel and confess that he was ``making
trouble and beating others after drinking.''
   The report said Zou suffered serious mental and physical
injuries in the attack.
   The Chinese government acknowledges that its attempts to
establish a working body of law and guarantee the rights of
citizens are still marred by abuse of power by public officials,
and the state-run press occasionally carries reports of police and
other officials beating and torturing suspects in criminal cases.

<HEAD>NYC Police Commissioner Questions Police Tactics in Park Riot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police commissioner criticized his
department's handling of a riot that left more than 50 people hurt,
saying the highest ranking officer there may have left at a crucial
time to go to the bathroom.
   ``We're better than that,'' Commissioner Benjamin Ward said
Wednesday in discussing a preliminary report he delivered to Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
   On Wednesday night, about 500 demonstrators chanting anti-police
slogans marched on a Manhattan precinct house, some of them
painting swastikas on squad cars, to protest police actions in
Sunday's riot.
   The marchers, led by New York Civil Liberties Union director
Norman Siegel, chanted ``the park belongs to the people'' as they
were met by two dozen police officers behind barricades. There was
no violence.
   An effort by police to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at Tompkins
Square Park last Sunday led to a protest that degenerated into a
clash between hundreds of officers with nightsticks and rock- and
bottle-throwing protesters. At least 52 people were injured,
including 14 officers. Enforcement of the curfew was suspended
Monday.
   Civilians accused the police of indiscriminately beating
protesters and bystanders. By late Wednesday, 73 complaints of
police brutality had been filed.
   Also Wednesday, a 29-year-old man filed a $50 million lawsuit
against the city, saying police attacked him with ``stormtrooper
savagery'' after he stumbled into the riot while trying to hail a
cab.
   In papers filed in state court, Kenneth Fish said a
club-swinging officer opened a gash that required 44 stitches.
   Early today, one man was killed and another injured in an
apparently drug-related shooting near the park, police said. The
curfew, which has been lifted, had been enforced after neighborhood
residents complained the park had become a noisy and unsafe
gathering place for drug dealers and derelicts.
   Ward said the preliminary report on the riot ``seems to me to
show a number of shortcomings and to answer some questions, but to
raise a number of other questions as well.''
   Among the questions, he said, were whether unnecessary force was
used; whether supervisors lost control of their personnel; and
whether motorists were trapped in cars, prompting a premature
charge by mounted police.
   ``I will require and demand answers to these still unanswered
questions as to whether or not we acted in our normal operating
procedures,'' he said.
   The report by Chief of Department Robert J. Johnston Jr. said
the temporary police headquarters should not have been set up in
the park and reserves should have been mobilized outside the area.
   Ward said officers moved against the protesters as quickly as
they did after receiving unconfirmed reports of people trapped in
cars on a street by the park, some of them screaming women and some
getting beaten by demonstrators.
   However, he added that he did not have the identity of any
trapped person, or any reports on anyone who was aided.
   He also said it appeared the ranking officer at the scene left
to return to the police station 12 blocks away to go to the
bathroom at ``a very crucial time at the beginning of this
demonstration.''
   While the commander was absent, he was not replaced permanently
at the scene by another high-ranking officer who could coordinate
the assignment of the hundreds of police officers who responded to
backup calls.

<TEXT>
   Resident have staged their annual
disappearing act as magicians from around the world materialized
for the magic festival that put this tiny village on the map.
   ``Most of the local folks plan their vacations for this week and
take off,'' said Greg Bordner, president of Abbott's Magic
Manufacturing Co., which sponsors the 51-year-old festival and
bills itself as the largest manufacturer of magic tricks in the
world.
   ``There's no question we get a lot of strange people here _
throwing fire around and sticking cards to the ceilings,'' Bordner
said Wednesday, the first day of the four-day festival.
   About 1,000 amateur and professional magicians, ranging from
illusionists and ventriloquists to the guy who pulls rabbits out of
a hat at birthday parties, flock each year to this rural community
near the Indiana border.
   About 3,000 others _ three times the town's population _ come
for the magic shows, which include a special appearance each year
by magician Harry Blackstone Jr. Blackstone's famous father, Harry
Blackstone Sr., spent summers here and introduced Australian
magician Percy Abbott to the area. In 1934, Abbott founded the
magic company, now a successful mail-order operation, with
Bordner's father, Recil Bordner.
   The local restaurant, Blackstone Inn, is located on the town's
main street, Blackstone Avenue.
   The magicians began arriving early in the week, some setting up
booths in the ``demonstration room'' _ the elementary school's
gymnasium _ to show their newest tricks and sell their trick cards,
scarves and handcuffs.
   Bordner recalls how magicians David Copperfield and Doug Henning
attended the festival years ago, ``when they were just two more
kids in the crowd.''
   Franz Harary, 26, who designs illusions for magician David
Copperfield and such entertainers as Michael Jackson and Alice
Cooper, moved four years ago from his hometown of Ann Arbor to
Hollywood, but he wouldn't think of missing the Colon festival.
   ``This place is like a mecca. The biggest guys from all over are
here,'' said Harary, who attended his first festival 13 years ago
after discovering a magic trick in a box of cereal. ``Abbott's is
like a part of me.''
   While Harary swaps secrets with established performers from
Japan, England and Czechoslovakia, Jim Caputo just wants to learn a
new card trick or a slicker way to pull a rabbit out of a hat.
Caputo, a research chemist at Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, does magic
shows at children's birthday parties on weekends.
   ``People think scientists aren't much fun, but you'd be
surprised,'' Caputo said. ``Next to kids, scientists are my best
audiences. I guess they have such rigid views, they're easy to
fool.''

<HEAD>Couple Convicted Of Kidnapping Elderly Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted a young couple of kidnapping
an elderly Louisiana woman, drugging her and stealing her life
savings of $100,000.
   After less than two hours of deliberations, the jury Wednesday
found Terry Barrett, 29, and Virginia Barrett, 30, guilty of
kidnapping, conspiracy, mail fraud and interstate transportation of
fraudulently taken securities.
   The couple could receive a maximum penalty of life sentences
plus 55 years and $2 million in fines from U.S. District Judge
Harold Murphy, who set sentencing for Sept. 23.
   Lucille Knight, 84, testified that the Barretts came to her
mobile home in Hammond, La., on Feb. 2, 1986, apparently drugged
her and then drove her to Ringgold, where she was held captive for
four months.
   Three young women who stayed with the Barretts testified that
the couple instructed them to give Mrs. Knight a variety of drugs.
She was finally rescued by a former sheriff's detective after she
managed to smuggle out a letter to a sister in Louisiana.
   Mrs. Knight, who worked in a state hospital in California for
more than 30 years, testified she did not know her savings were
gone until after she returned to Hammond. She has sued a bank in
Hammond for allowing her money to be withdrawn without her approval.
   The Barretts were accused of getting Mrs. Knight's money with
forged signatures on personal checks, cashier's checks,
certificates of deposit, and Social Security and retirement checks.
They admitted Monday to forging checks on Mrs. Knight's account but
denied the kidnapping charges.
   According to testimony, the Barretts placed Mrs. Knight's money
in their own bank account in Chattanooga, Tenn., where they
operated a bakery, and depleted the funds within four months.
   ``The taking of an elderly woman by drugging her for four
months, holding her against her will and taking all of her life
savings is fundamentally evil,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas D.
Bever said after the verdict. ``We're very pleased with the
verdict.''
   Defense Attorney John E. Sawhill III had no immediate comment on
the verdict.

   Hundreds of people in this Milwaukee
suburb spent the night away from home as railroad crews righted
derailed freight cars containing hazardous materials.
   An estimated 1,000 people were evacuated from homes and
businesses within 500 feet of the Soo Line railroad tracks after 24
cars left the rails Wednesday.
   Officials said there were no injuries and no sign of leaks in
two tank cars containing methanol and isobutane, both flammable
substances, but that people were moved as a precaution.
   Brookfield Fire Chief James H. Merhring said the residents would
not be allowed to return until the two tank cars were removed.
Waukesha County Deputy Sheriff Terry Martorano said that might not
be until this evening.
   The Red Cross said most of the evacuated residents spent the
night with relatives or friends.
   Railroad workers said a set of wheels under one of the 117 cars
in the train left the rails and snagged on a track switch.
   The derailed cars punched holes in a trackside warehouse and
damaged a grain elevator.

<HEAD>Study Traces Disease to Cat Having Kittens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of pneumonia and other illness among
12 poker players was spread by a cat that gave birth near their
card table, medical researchers reported today.
   The players got Q fever, a bacterial disease that is sometimes
spread by farm animals, said Dr. Joanne M. Langley and colleagues
from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who pieced
together the story and published it in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   The eight men and four women met two or three times at week at
one of their homes in Halifax to play poker. Usually seven of them
played while three or four others drank beer and waited for a seat
at the table.
   On Feb. 14, 1987, the homeowner's cat gave birth to three
kittens in the poker room during a game.
   The cat's owner was the first to become ill, on March 5. During
the following two weeks, the others got sick. All had been present
the night the cat had her kittens.
   One of the card players died, but the rest got better on their
own or after taking antibiotics.
   Doctors later found that the cat carried Coxiella burnetii, the
microbe that causes Q fever. The bacteria is found in high
concentrations in the amniotic fluid, placentas and fetal membranes
of infected animals.
   In Nova Scotia, the disease is largely confined to rural areas.
The researchers believe the cat caught the germ from a rodent.
   ``If our hypothesis about how the cat became infected is true,''
they wrote, ``then it is possible that Q fever may become an urban
disease in Nova Scotia.''

<HEAD>DeSillers Reported Burglary After She Was Asked To Return
Belongings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria DeSillers reported her apartment burglarized
four days after she was asked to turn over thousands of dollars
worth of valuables allegedly bought with donations for her dying
son's liver transplants.
   The day after the burglary report was filed, a judge acted on
the request for the valuables made by the curator of the estate of
Ms. DeSillers' son, Ronnie, and ordered her to turn them over or
face contempt charges.
   Ms. DeSillers told Metro-Dade police the break-in occurred
sometime between July 30 and Aug. 2. Missing are a $1,500 stereo,
jewelry, leather goods, clothing and a $50 bottle of Passion
perfume, she told police.
   Police said that there were no signs of forced entry at Ms.
DeSillers' fifth-floor Miami apartment.
   ``It could only mean two things,'' Detective Barry Garafola
said. ``A lock pick, or someone had a key.''
   The burglary report Sunday came four days after court-appointed
curator Karen Gievers demanded that Ms. DeSillers turn over such
items as her BMW car, jewelry and clothing that she allegedly
purchased with funds donated to Ronnie.
   The 7-year-old boy died in April 1987 after three liver
transplants.
   On Monday, Dade Circuit Judge Francis J. Christie followed Ms.
Gievers' request and ordered Ms. DeSillers to turn over the
belongings by Tuesday. When she failed to comply, in part because
she dismissed an attorney who had advised her to give up the items,
the judge held a hearing Wednesday and extended the deadline to 4
p.m. today.
   Ms. DeSillers, who took in $690,000 in contributions, including
$1,000 from President Reagan, has been accused of spending $200,000
on personal expense, including $11,000 in jewelry and $13,500 on
the BMW.
   Ms. DeSillers' new lawyer ridiculed the court-imposed deadline
for his client to turn over the valuables, including some clothing.
   ``I guess they just want to make sure Maria walks around nude.
Do they want her pantyhose? What's the value of a blouse purchased
a year ago? Nobody wants to buy her used clothes,'' lawyer Frank
Johnson said after Wednesday's hearing.
   Ms. Gievers also contends that since Ronnie died, his mother
gave a total of $40,000 to her brother, ex-husband and
ex-boyfriend. She also is accused of paying herself $88,000 to head
her now-defunct Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation.
   Ms. DeSillers has maintained she is heir to the $243,000
remaining in the estate of Ronnie, who died awaiting a fourth
transplant at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital.
   Ms. DeSillers has refused to pay a $262,000 bill from the
hospital, which she blames for her son's death, a charge doctors
there vehemently deny.

<HEAD>At Least 80 Dead in Burma Riots; Many Victims Reportedly Unarmed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Israeli official's comments from
Rangoon, accounts of travelers, Japan advising against travel to
Burma. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Burma's worst riots since democracy was
overthrown 26 years ago have left at least 80 people dead this
week, and one diplomat said the situation was worsening and it was
very dangerous to go outside in Rangoon.
   Travelers and diplomats said the nation's rulers, most of them
current or former military men, appeared to be trying to seal the
country and Rangoon, the capital and home to 3.5 million people,
was nearly at a standstill.
   They said fear of food shortages was looming, the city's vital
river port was not functioning and most stores and businesses were
closed.
   ``The city is basically not functioning,'' said one American
returning from Rangoon.
   Travelers reported random detentions and said virtually every
Burmese they spoke with expressed distaste, often hatred, for the
government.
   Students, who initially formed the bulk of the demonstrators,
have increasingly been joined by Buddhist monks, workers, some
government civil servants and even children, they said.
   Burma's official radio said 33 people died in street battles
Wednesday in the capital, Rangoon. It said rioters beheaded three
policemen.
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported today that informed sources
believed Burmese leaders met in an all-night emergency session to
discuss how to deal with the violence.
   The protests, demanding an end to the strong-arm rule of new
leader Sein Lwin, prompted the United States to temporarily close
its embassy in Burma on Wednesday. All official American personnel
and their dependents _ 154 people _ were safe, State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   An Israeli official indicated his country might take similar
measures. Japan and Britain urged citizens not to travel in Burma.
   Official media reports from Burma said 80 people died in riots
from Monday to Wednesday. Radio Rangoon reported about 160 wounded
and 1,500 arrested in the three days.
   Unofficial reports said the death count may be well over 100 and
that many victims were unarmed.
   Kyodo News Agency said more than 100 people were killed and
nearly 1,000 wounded Wednesday in Rangoon. It quoted an
unidentified, informed source in the capital as saying soldiers
used automatic rifles and machine guns to disperse demonstrators.
   Israel's top diplomat in Rangoon said the situation was getting
worse.
   ``I spend minimum time in the streets because it's simply very
dangerous. I don't go out, I'm either at home or at the embassy,''
Elie Ventura, the acting ambassador, told Israel's armed forces
radio in a telephone interview.
   He said Israel was considering closing its embassy for the
staff's safety.
   The protests have continued despite martial law, curfews and
prohibitions of large gatherings imposed Tuesday in the capital.
   They are by far the largest since a coup by Ne Win ended
democracy in Burma in 1962. Sein Lwin became president and head of
the sole political party last month when Ne Win resigned.
   Rangoon-based diplomats say shortages of food and commodities
stemming from Ne Win's isolationist economic policies are partly to
blame for the unrest.
   With a per capita income of less than $200, Burma is one of the
world's poorest nations. Inflation is soaring and Burma has a $4
billion foreign debt.
   Since fall, there have been anti-government demonstrations in
virtually every city and town.
   Protesters accuse Sein Lwin of ruthlessly suppressing student
riots in March and June, when he was an army general, and of
earlier harsh measures against dissenters.
   Shortly after taking power, Sein Lwin ordered the arrests of the
most outspoken critic of the government, former Brig. Gen. Aung
Gyi, other dissidents and Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
   Some travelers said they were interrogated and detained in
Rangoon, and others were expelled before their seven-day visas
expired. ``They're flushing everyone from the country,'' one
British tourist said.
   Alain Ervard, a news photographer based in Hong Kong, said
soldiers chased him after he took pictures of tanks and vehicles
with mounted machine guns, which formed a barrier to keep huge
crowds from converging. ``The military got ready to shoot (me), and
they told me to stop,'' he said.
   Ervard said he and nine Spanish tourists were held overnight at
the immigration office in Rangoon. He said they were interrogated,
their passports seized temporarily and their film confiscated.
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand today joined a
number of professional and human rights organizations calling for
Sein Win's release.
   In a letter to Sein Lwin, the club said the ``senior and highly
respected fellow journalist ... appears to have been arrested for
simply performing his duty as a good reporter.''
   The note also expressed concern over the apparent ban of the
entry of foreign reporters into Burma. Foreign journalists have
been kept out since trouble began after the transfer of power.

<TEXT>
   The city's 1,600 public nurses narrowly
avoided joining a two-week-old strike by nearly 4,000 private
nurses and support workers when they approved a new one-year
contract by a narrow margin.
   Nurses at San Francisco General Hospital and other public health
facilities voted 320-307 Wednesday for the new pact, said Donna
Gerber, field representative for Local 790 of the United Public
Employees union.
   ``This is not a mandate for the management of the city,'' said
Gerber. ``The management of this city must get the message that the
nurses are fed up.''
   The union mainly sought a staffing ratio of four patients to one
nurse. Nurses say they sometimes care for seven to 10 patients at a
time. However, a tentative pact reached Sunday calls for an
unspecific ``modified ratio,'' which Gerber said might be a
sticking point for many of the voting nurses.
   ``There's no question that some of our members see this as too
little, too late,'' she said.
   About 2,200 private nurses and 1,700 support workers went on
strike Aug. 2 against eight private hospitals in a wage dispute.
They have since resumed talks with hospital administrators.
   The California Nurses Association wants raises of 11 percent the
first year of a new contract and 10 percent the second year. Karen
Henry, a spokeswoman for Affiliated Hospitals, a group of private
area hospitals, said the group has offered raises of 18 percent
over 31 months.
   Members of Local 250 of the Hospital Health Care Workers Union,
representing the support workers, are striking over health benefits
and sick leave.

<TEXT>
   Riot police surrounded college
campuses today to block marches by radical students seeking
reunification talks with North Korea. Minor clashes erupted in six
cities, and five students were reported injured.
   The government enforced strict security measures to block
preparations for a march to the border Monday by students planning
talks with communist North Korean student delegates. About 30,000
riot police were deployed nationwide.
   About 400 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with
riot police in the southern port city of Pusan as they were blocked
from marching, authorities said. Five students were injured, they
said.
   ``Advance national unification through student talks!'' students
chanted.
   Scattered clashes were also reported in the southwestern city of
Kwangju, where riot police fired tear gas to break up a march by
about 300 students. Twenty students were arrested after minor
street protests in Masan in the south.
   Bands of students hurled firebombs at a police station in the
eastern city of Wonju and at an office of the government party in
Taegu in the south, police said. No injuries were reported.
   On Wednesday, radical students attacked 12 police stations and
government party offices nationwide, according to police reports.
   Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after a rally
at Donggok University in Seoul when they were blocked from
marching. Police drove the students back into the campus with tear
gas.
   Peaceful rallies to support the reunification talks were held at
several other Seoul colleges. Riot police stood guard outside, but
students did not march out and there were no confrontations.
   The government has banned the march and reunification talks on
grounds that it alone has the authority to conduct talks with
communist North Korea. A similar march June 10 for reunification
talks was blocked by riot police.
   Turnout for rallies and marches to Seoul to join the main march
has been low, with no more than a few hundred students
participating in most cities.
   A summer heat wave, summer vacation and strong public opposition
appear to have reduced support for the radicals. North Korea has
said it will send student delegates to the talks site, but they are
seen as being under government control.
   Opposition lawmaker Rep. Park Kwang-yong said radical students
were ready to delay talks with North Korean delegates if they are
allowed to stage a march across the nation.
   Government officials said there was no change in their position
and no talks would be allowed. The government has offered to
arrange meetings with North Korea students under its auspices.
   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try
to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The
students, a small, but powerful minority on college campuses, have
failed to gain support because of their violent tactics and open
advances to the North.
   The students say they are not communists, but insist that the
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences
being worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian
north is determined to conquer the south.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean
War, which ended three years later with an armistice but no
political settlement.

   Oregon firefighters contained a wildfire that charred 13,000
acres of the Deschutes National Forest while their counterparts
fought to gain the upper hand in blazes in Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming
and Montana.
   Fire lines around the Paulina, Ore., fire were completed
Wednesday evening, said Forest Service spokeswoman Laura Allen. She
said the blaze was expected to be controlled by 1,400 firefighters
and support personnel by Friday night.
   The fire, about 25 miles southeast of Bend, threatened two small
resorts before the winds shifted. Plans for evacuating the resorts
were canceled Tuesday night.
   The fire, which began Aug. 4, was human-caused, but the means
has not been determined.
   In Wyoming, a blaze that has charred 30,000 acres of Yellowstone
National park threatened a park campground.
   Spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said winds of 15-25 mph fanned the fire
Wednesday afternoon, but firefighters hoped to hold it about three
miles from the camp site.
   Like the rest of the fires burning on about 191,000 acres of
Yellowstone, the blaze has been stable for several days.Anzelmo
said a string of cool days has given fire managers hope that they
may be close to containing the blazes.
   In central Idaho, increased air traffic by firefighters and
smoke at a month-old, 13,000-acre wilderness fire north of Stanley
prompted the closure of a Forest Service guard station and a nearby
private airstrip Wednesday, arousing the ire of some Idaho boating
outfitters.
   The air strip closure forced outfitters and private rafters to
fly into an airstrip 10 miles downstream to put in on the Middle
Fork of the Salmon River.
   ``There's going to be a smoke problem in there plus our own air
traffic,'' said Challis National Forest spokesman Jim James. ``Our
priority No. 1 is public safety on the river.''
   Meanwhile, in the Targhee National Forest in eastern Idaho, hot
spots flared in the 1,500-acre Spring Canyon II blaze.
   Scattered thunderstorms were expected to reach Idaho this
afternoon and fire officials are concerned lightning could create
another round of wildfires, said Forest Service fire information
officer Gary Cornell.
   Four fires caused by lightning June 25 have burned together in
central Idaho's Payette National Forest, said forest spokesman Dave
Olson. The perimeter of the fire encompasses about 12,000 acres of
burning and untouched forest.
   To the north in the Nez Perce National Forest, some 200
firefighters contained a 1,000-acre blaze on the Main Salmon River
Wednesday night, said Mary Zabinski, a fire information officer.
   Near Carson City, Nev., a fast-moving brush fire was reported 50
percent contained today after roaring through at least 1,800 acres.
   The fire, which was sparked by lightning Wednesday, burned into
the back yards of several homes before moving into Sierra Nevada
foothills to the west, sending up a huge, mushroom-shaped cloud of
flame and smoke visible 20 miles away.
   Residents who were evacuated soon after the blaze began later
were able to return to their homes, and no structures were damaged.
   South of Helena, Mont., nearly 800 firefighters planned today to
assault a human-caused wildfire burning unhindered on over 700
acres in the Elkhorn Mountains. Gusty winds and temperatures in the
mid-90s fueled the flames Wednesday, said fire information officer
Dave Turner.
   Meanwhile, 60 miles to the northwest, a 33,000-acre fire caused
by lightning was being allowed to burn unchecked in the Scapegoat
Wilderness. and Clark National Forest officials closed the
wilderness south of Welcome Pass to the public because of the
continuing fire danger.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Beryl Starts To Break Up; Thunderstorms Heavy In
Some Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Beryl was breaking up as it moved slowly across
northeast Texas today after leaving up to an inch of rain in
southeast Texas and western Louisiana.
   Intense thunderstorms developed in eastern North Dakota and
western Minnesota on Wednesday night, producing high winds, hail
and brief heavy rains.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph near Hillsboro, N.D., and to 65 mph at
Ada, Minn. Golf ball-sized hail fell near Mayville, N.D., while
hail and nearly an inch of rain fell on Harwood, N.D.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered over southwest
Texas, New Mexico, Montana, Florida and along the Atlantic Coast
from Georgia to New Jersey.
   The high in the nation Wednesday was 112 degrees at Lake Havasu
City, Ariz., and Borrego Springs, Calif.
   Today's weather forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in
the lower Mississippi Valley, the eastern two-thirds of the Gulf
Coast, Florida, the southern Atlantic Coast, and parts of Texas and
the Appalachians.
   Because of the vestiges of tropical storm Beryl, thunderstorms
were predicted to be most numerous over central Arkansas. Numerous
thunderstorms also were expected in southern Florida.
   Forecasters said showers and thunderstorms should be scattered
in parts of the mountain regions of Arizona and New Mexico, and
southwest Texas; thunderstorms should develop later in the day from
the northern Plains to the northern Mississippi Valley.
   The rest of the nation should have mostly sunny skies, and highs
in the 90s were predicted for most of the country.
   Readings in the 80s were forecast from the northern Atlantic
Coast to the upper Great Lakes states; in the 70s and 80s over the
Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; near 100 in
southwest and south-central Texas and the northern Plains; and
100-110 in the desert Southwest and California valleys.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49 degrees
at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 95 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Ninety Vietnamese Boat People Want To Go Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Vietnamese boat people asking to
be sent back home shot up during the past week after talks between
Hong Kong and Vietnam over large-scale repatriation, a government
spokeswoman said today.
   At least 90 Vietnamese who fled to this British colony by boat
have volunteered to return home, including about 70 who made the
request after last week's talks, according to the spokeswoman, who
demanded anonymity.
   Only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from Hong
Kong since 1978, including two in July.
   Hong Kong and Vietnam officials met in Hanoi to discuss
repatriating boat people viewed by the British colony not as
political refugees but as illegal immigrants fleeing a battered
economy.
   No agreement was reached but further talks are expected.
   Vietnam has said it would repatriate boat people who want to
return home, while Hong Kong is seeking to send back most
Vietnamese who arrived after mid-June.
   After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Hong Kong considered all
Vietnamese arriving by boat to be political refugees eligible for
resettlement in third countries.
   But under a new policy which took effect June 16 to curb the
surging number of arrivals, all incoming Vietnamese are considered
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove
they fled communist Vietnam because of persecution.
   The spokeswoman said some of the 90 volunteers were classified
as illegal immigrants while others were classified as refugees
entitled to be resettled overseas. She said she had no further
details.
   The repatriation applications will be forwarded to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to discuss with Hanoi.
   About 7,000 Vietnamese have sailed into Hong Kong since the new
policy took effect, bringing the number of boat people in the
colony to about 23,000.
   United Nations officials could not be reached for immediate
comment.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Mass Grave of Baby Dinosaurs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists from China and Canada said today that
they unearthed a mass grave of sheep-sized baby dinosaurs who were
apparently buried during a sandstorm 75 million years ago.
   Dr. Philip Currie, of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in
Alberta, said the joint team excavated the skulls of five baby
Pinacosaurus in the wastelands of southern Inner Mongolia.
   He said they found a sixth baby on the last day of their summer
expedition, ``and it appears likely there are a number of other
specimens.''
   One adult, which in life was ``about the size of an extremely
heavy bull,'' was also discovered nearby, he said.
   ``We feel that the five babies were congregating together behind
a sand dune in a sandstorm,'' Currie said. Either they were buried
by sand or killed by the collapsing dune, he said.
   Currie said it was first time the plant-eating reptile had been
found to be ``gregarious,'' or living and moving in groups.
   The Canada-China Dinosaur Project, working together for the
second straight summer in the fertile and largely untouched
dinosaur fields of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China's far west,
found the remains of about 50 other dinosaurs and their nests, and
40 other mammals, turtles and lizards.
   The Bayan Manduhau area of southern Inner Mongolia where the
babies were dug up was first explored by American and Swedish
paleontologists in 1928 and 1931. This year's find was in a spot
that was inaccessible at that time because of lack of roads.
   Hou Lianhai of the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, said the team in
Xinjiang had excavated a meat-eating theropod but needed another
year to dig up a brontosaurus-like sauropod.
   Both beasts were discovered in Xinjiang during the first
expedition last year. The sauropod, about 160 million years old and
estimated to have been 100 feet long, is one of the largest of its
kind to have been found in Asia, Hou said.
   At a news conference, Currie and Hou also revealed one nearly
intact oblong-shaped egg, about eight inches long, and several
broken egg shells of the Protoceratops, a pig-sized horned dinosaur.
   Currie said the year's finds will help understand the histories
of dinosaurs in Asia and North America. He said the fossils
discovered in Inner Mongolia were the same age as those found in
Alberta, another great repository of dinosaurs, and that many of
the same kinds of reptiles were turning up.
   He said it was still not clear whether the dinosaurs migrated
from either the dry, dune-coursed Asian deserts or the wetter lands
of North America, or whether they may have developed independently.
   The dinosaur project is to return to China again next year and
in the future may carry out further research in either China or
northern Canada. Noble said there are also plans to stage a world
tour of dinosaur fossils from around 1991.
   The project is coordinated by the Ex-Terra Foundation and
supported by the Canadian government.

   An engine fire forced a United Airlines
737 with 107 people aboard to abort its takeoff, and at least nine
passengers were injured evacuating the burning twin-engine jet,
authorities said.
   The jet, which was en route to Chicago, was traveling at 100 to
115 mph and had not left the ground when the pilot applied the
brakes at Little Rock Regional Airport on Wednesday, said United
spokesman Rob Doughty.
   Passengers and flight attendants opened emergency hatches and
either climbed onto the wings or slid down evacuation chutes.
   Two passengers were in satisfactory condition today at St.
Vincent Infirmary Medical Center, nursing supervisors said. Among
seven others treated at hospitals and released were two women who
suffered broken ankles, officials said.
   Joe P. Carrigan, FAA assistant air traffic manager, said it is
uncertain if the aircraft would have crashed if it had taken off.
   ``An aircraft can fly on one engine,'' Carrigan said. ``There
are a lot of factors. It certainly would have tested his pilotage.''
   Doughty said the cause of the fire was under investigation.

<HEAD>Eight Blacks Charged in Mandela House Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today that eight
blacks were charged with public violence in connection with an
arson fire at the home of Nelson Mandela, imprisoned leader of the
outlawed African National Congress.
   Police said the eight range in age from 16 to 22 and were
arrested Aug. 3 in the black township of Soweto, outside
Johannesburg. They were arraigned in a Soweto court Wednesday,
freed on $145 bail and ordered to appear back in court Sept. 12,
police said.
   They were not charged with arson, ``but it is possible further
charges will be formulated,'' said police spokesman Reg Crewe in
Pretoria.
   The Soweto home that Mandela has rented since the 1940s was
gutted in a fire July 28. Township residents said the attack was
the result of a dispute between youths who guard the Mandela home
and youths from Daliwonga High School in another section of Soweto.
   Mandela's attorney, Ismail Ayob, said the Mandela family was not
the target of the attack. Mandela's wife, Winnie, lived at the
home. Her youngest daughter, Zindzi, 27, and her two children lived
in a sidehouse that wasn't damaged. All are staying with friends
until the burned house is rebuilt.
   No one was at the home during the fire, and no one was hurt.
   Ayob said Mandela, serving a life term for sabotage and plotting
the overthrow of the government, sent a message from his Pollsmoor
Prison cell asking that no one be prosecuted and that the family
not file charges.
   Soweto police spokesman Maj. Fanyana Zwane was quoted by a
Johannesburg newspaper as saying there had been a joint
police-military operation last week at a Soweto school ``in
connection with the Mandela arson.''
   The newspaper, Business Day, quoted Michael Mkhize, principal of
Daliwonga High School, as saying police and soldiers surrounded the
school on Aug. 3, holding staff and pupils at gunpoint and
arresting 22 students. Fourteen of the students were released, he
was quoted as saying.
   Mkhize was quoted as saying he was ordered to point out members
of the Student Representative Council or the Soweto Students
Congress, and was treated roughly and held in custody for an hour
when he refused.
   Police had no comment on those allegations.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

   A man in a pickup truck dragged a dead
horse on a rope four miles, smearing a country road with entrails,
the sheriff says.
   ``This whole community is very, very upset about it,'' said
Yadkin County Sheriff Jack Henderson. ``And I can understand why.''
   Henderson said he would investigate. No charges were filed.
   Dean Cole told authorities that the horse had died of colic at
his house and that he tied the carcass to the back of his truck and
dragged it to a relative's farm Tuesday to be buried, Henderson
said.
   ``He freely admits to doing it _ and also admits he made a
mistake doing it,'' the sheriff said.
   Julie Goodin, director of the Forsyth County Humane Society,
questioned Cole's account, and some residents accused him of
dragging the horse to its death.
   ``It was alive when I saw it go up the road,'' said Frieda Hall.
``It was trotting, but even a trot is too fast for an animal in
this heat.''
   She said she saw entrails scattered about the road. ``It was
just everywhere,'' she said. ``It was so much I figured it must
have fallen off some truck.''
   Ms. Goodin said the humane society received two complaints. ``I
just think this is really sad,'' she said.

<HEAD>Japan Launching Superfast Passenger Jet Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is launching a project to develop an
ultrasonic passenger plane that will be able to fly between New
York and Tokyo in three to five hours, officials said today.
   The powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which
helped engineer Japan's success in automobiles and computer chips,
is putting together teams of companies that will conduct research
on advanced engines and fuselage materials for the plane, MITI
officials said.
   Although the plane's top speed has not been decided, engineers
expect it will be able to fly up to five times the speed of sound,
or nearly 4,000 mph, the officials said. A non-stop flight between
Tokyo and New York now takes about 13 hours. The world's fastest
passenger jet now is the European-built Concorde, which can fly
about twice the speed of sound.
   An official in MITI's Aircraft Division said the two research
projects, to begin in 1989, will take seven to eight years to
complete.
   The government plans to allocate about $225 million to $260
million for engine research, and $52 million to $60 million for
research on fuselage materials, he said. The allocations still must
be approved formally by Japan's Finance Ministry and Parliament.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said MITI
decided to begin the research programs after it was approached in
1986 by the U.S. Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas about possible
Japanese participation in a similar superfast plane project in the
United States.
   Last year, the U.S. government reportedly began issuing
contracts for development of portions of the U.S. ultrasonic plane,
dubbed the ``Orient Express'' by President Reagan.
   After the MITI research projects end, the Japanese companies
involved will get together with U.S. companies working on superfast
plane technology and decide on plans for further development of the
plane, possibly with government guidance, the official said.
   Industry analysts say production of such an advanced plane would
take massive technical and financial resources, more than any
single company or country can provide.
   Although most of the Japanese research program is likely to be
conducted independently, the MITI officials said they don't intend
to compete with the United States.
   ``It's a very big project, so I don't think we will be
competitive,'' one official said. ``We'll need to work together.''
   Japan is advanced in many aspects of aviation and aerospace
technology, but the country's aircraft industry has had little
success so far on the international market. In recent years, MITI
has made the industry a high priority and has supported development
of key aircraft projects.
   Japanese companies are involved in manufacturing fuselage
sections for the Boeing 767 airliner, but analysts say the industry
is eager to achieve the status of full partner, rather than
subcontractor, in future joint projects.
   The MITI research projects would give Japanese companies a
chance to catch up with, and perhaps surpass, U.S. engine and
fuselage technology.
   The official in MITI's Aircraft Division said development of a
superfast plane would give Japan a major opportunity to boost its
aviation industry.
   The engine research, to focus on a combination turbo-jet and
ram-jet design, will be led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and will
include Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, the official said.
   A group of about 20 companies will conduct the research on new
fuselage materials that meet the requirement of being able to
withstand temperatures above 900 degrees, he said.

<TEXT>
   Adela Rogers St. Johns, an early
feminist and avowed ``sob sister'' who broke into the men's world
of newspapering on a $7-a-week salary and covered some of the
biggest stories of the century, is dead at 94.
   Mrs. St. Johns died Wednesday at the South County Convalescent
Hospital.
   During her 60-year career, she covered the abdication of King
Edward VIII, the assassination of Louisiana Sen. Huey Long and the
``trial of the century'' of Bruno Richard Hauptmann in the
kidnapping and murder of Charles A. Lindbergh's infant son.
   She sold her first story to the Los Angeles Times at age 9 and
became a protege of press baron William Randolph Hearst, who hired
her as a cub reporter at the San Francisco Examiner in 1913, when
there were few women in the newsroom.
   She later worked for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, another
Hearst paper, and the International News Service.
   She came out of retirement in 1976 to cover the bank robbery and
conspiracy trial of Hearst's granddaughter, Patricia, for the San
Francisco Examiner.
   ``She was a kind of wild, uninhibited woman before feminism came
in,'' said Mel Durslag, a syndicated sports columnist and 50-year
Hearst veteran.
   ``She was a tough, hard, newspaper woman, one of the guys. She
was a figure from the old roaring days of Hearst journalism, which
no longer lives.''
   Mrs. St. Johns claimed several firsts, including the first woman
to cover a police beat and the first allowed in the press box at
sporting events.
   Her ability to get juicy stories for Photoplay magazine won her
the nickname ``Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''
   An ardent feminist, she once wrote: ``I wish women would stand
together and shackle the men who want to move us backwards.''
   The ``sob sister'' defended her tear-jerking style, saying once,
``Unless you move the heart of the country you will never get it
moving.''
   In 1962, she published ``Final Verdict,'' about her father,
renowned criminal lawyer Earl Rogers. Perhaps her best-received
book was ``The Honeycomb,'' an autobiography published in 1969.
   Mrs. St. Johns was a longtime friend of former President Richard
Nixon, who cited her ``exceptional ability to reveal the human
story behind the news'' when she received the Medal of Honor in
1970.
   Survivors include three children, 10 grandchildren, 13
great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Funeral
services were scheduled for Tuesday in Glendale.

<HEAD>Mammoth Skeleton Found at 9,000 Feet in Central Utah</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRVIEW, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skeleton of a mammoth, a forerunner of
the elephant, has been unearthed at the surprisingly high elevation
of 9,000 feet during construction of an irrigation dam, scientists
said.
   The discovery at Huntington Canyon excited paleontologists and
archaeologists, who kneeled around the mammoth's skull Wednesday
and scraped away mud that has preserved the skeleton for 10,000 to
15,000 years.
   The discovery is expected to enhance understanding of the
mammoth and the environment of central Utah after the last Ice Age.
   ``It essentially has been in a refrigerator for 10,000 years,''
said David Gillette, state paleontologist. ``It all adds up to
wonderful preservation.''
   The presence of a mammoth at 9,000 feet above sea level was
intriguing, Gillette said.
   Mammoths generally foraged in lower-elevation grasslands. The
high-altitude canyon's environment has not changed appreciably
since the post-glacial period in which the mammoth apparently
lived, he said.
   The discovery was made Monday during construction of a dam that
will provide water for the Huntington-Cleveland area.
   A construction worker was operating a backhoe near the base of
the dam when the blade struck a large bone that turned out to be
the mammoth's skull.
   The blade cut into the cheekbone and crunched a shoulder blade
and tusk but did little overall damage to the remains, officials
said.

   Ronald Reagan's old school _ a brick building
erected 80 years ago _ has been sold for $500.
   The only bidder on South Central School was the
privately-supported Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home Preservation
Foundation, which owns the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home on the same
street.
   Charles T. Beckman, foundation secretary, said the group may use
the 46,000-square-foot building to house presidential memorabilia
or restore it as it was when Reagan attended fifth grade there. He
said the decision will be up to the president.
   Months ago the Dixon School Board set a selling price of $76,500
on the 1908 building, but there were no bidders at that price.
Assistant Superintendent Robert Aubry said the district has no use
for the building.
   ``It's in need of substantial repairs. A property is worth what
someone is willing to pay you,'' he said.
   South Central School is the only school still standing in Dixon
that Reagan attended. Classes have not been held there for several
years, but the building was used to house district offices.

   The 10-day outlook promises little relief from
the drought plaguing the nation, despite the wet remains of
tropical storm Beryl, the National Weather Service reports.
   While the remnants of Beryl could provide significant rain for
the Southeast, that's the only region likely to benefit, the agency
said in a drought advisory.
   Higher than normal temperatures are expected from the Northern
Plains to New England during the next five days, according to the
outlook, and that could persist for as long as 10 days.
   Normal rainfall is expected over much of the eastern two-thirds
of the nation, but significant shortages of water remain. Despite
some recent storms, six to 12 inches of rain are still needed to
return the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys to near-normal
conditions.
   The Missouri Valley can continue to expect below-normal rain,
while it could be somewhat above normal in the Great Lakes and New
England regions, the forecast said.
   The forest fire potential for the next five days will be very
high to extreme in the far West, Great Basin and Northern Plains
states, the report added. The risk is medium in a band extending
from Arizona to Michigan and medium to low in the South and East.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National legislators today inspected
the tomb of former President Chun Doo-hwan's parents to investigate
allegations that he diverted government funds for a lavish memorial.
   Governing and opposition party lawmakers visited Chun's
birthplace near the southern city of Hapchon as part of a probe of
alleged corruption involving Chun and his family.
   The opposition says Chun ordered government officials to
construct a large garden and decorations around the tomb.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said the lawmakers earlier visited
the southern city of Kwangju to inspect a governor's residence.
   They found that the government spent about $1.7 million to
transform the governor's residence into a luxurious safe house for
Chun, Yonhap said.
   Officials said the legislators, from a special assembly
committee, also planned to inspect a luxury lakeside villa built by
Chun and now used by President Roh Tae-woo as a presidential summer
house.
   The opposition wants the former president, who left office in
February at the end of a seven-year term, to testify before the
assembly about corruption under his administration. Roh's governing
party has opposed the idea.
   Roh played a key role in helping Chun seize power with military
backing in 1980. Roh won election in December when the opposition
fielded two presidential candidates.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, is on trial on charges
of embezzling millions of dollars. His wife, Lee Soon-ja, and her
family also have been under public fire for alleged
influence-peddling and corruption during her husband's
administraion.
   Son Joo-hwan, a senior governing party lawmaker, today said his
party would disclose alleged corruption by opposition leaders if
the opposition pressed for Chun's testimony.
   Son claimed opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam
have diverted party funds to invest in real estate, stocks and
other private businesses.

<HEAD>Activist Seeks Blacks-Only Convention to Select Mayoral Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans are under way for a pair of blacks-only
conventions at which a single black candidate would be selected to
run for mayor next year.
   ``White people remain true to their people first,'' said Lu
Palmer, chairman of the Black Independent Political Organization
and the moving force behind the plan. ``We, as black people, should
think of black people first.''
   Palmer said Wednesday he fears that if more than one black
candidate surfaces, a white candidate will win easily in next
year's special election to serve out the remaining two years in the
late Harold Washington's term.
   Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, died of a heart attack
in November.
   ``Politically, economically, socially ..., nothing in the city
or the country matters as much as race,'' Palmer said.
   The first convention, on Aug. 27, would allow representatives of
black churches and other organizations to hear from all ``serious''
black candidates, he said.
   Delegates would poll their organizations and vote at a second
convention in late September. Each candidate would be asked to sign
a pledge to abide by the results, Palmer said.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, a black selected with white support in
December to serve until the special election, said he has not
decided whether to attend the conventions and questioned the
concept of anall-black selection process.
   ``Due to the fact that we're making an effort to make this one
Chicago, I'm not sure that it's a good idea,'' he said.
   Supporters of Alderman Timothy Evans, considered Sawyer's chief
rival in the mayoral contest, said the conventions could be rigged
in favor of yet another potential black candidate, Alderman Danny
Davis.
   Davis said he will participate in the conventions but would
prefer that the conventions be open to ``the entire progressive
community.''
   ``We know that race and ethnicity have long undergirded politics
in Chicago,'' Davis said. ``But I hope and desire to try and help
Chicago move beyond the politics of race.''

<HEAD>Italy Reports Two Hostages Freed by Ethiopian Rebels</HEAD>

   Two Italian technicians kidnapped by Ethiopian
rebels in November have been freed, the Italian Foreign Ministry
reported today.
   It said the two men, Salvatore Barone and Paolo Bellini, reached
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum today. It gave no details on their
release but said it came after a ``long and complex action'' by the
Italian government.
   The two men were abducted Nov. 16 at Lake Tana in northwestern
Ethiopia, where they were working on a project to build a dike on
the Blue Nile and construct roads in the area.
   A little known group called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Party claimed responsibility, saying the Italians were seized
because the project they were working on would strengthen the
Ethiopian government.
   In May, there were reports the men were released but they turned
out to be false.
   A third Italian, Giuseppe Micelli, has been held by Ethiopian
rebels since June.

   Japanese scientists performed chemical-warfare
experiments on Americans and other prisoners of war, and the U.S.
government used the findings, historians said.
   U.S. defense officials said there was insufficient evidence to
support the accusations, which were made Wednesday during an
international conference on the history of science in China at the
University of California at San Diego.
   Osamu Imai, press secretary in the Japanese Embassy in
Washington, said his government could not confirm or deny that
biological warfare experiments occurred because all World War II
records have been destroyed.
   During the forum, historians presented research describing in
chilling detail experiments in which between 2,000 and 3,000
Soviets, Chinese and Koreans were believed to have died during the
1930s and '40s.
   The Japanese biological experiment program began in 1931 in
Harbin in central Manchuria under the direction of Lt. Gen. Shiro
Ishii, a surgeon, according to Kei-ichi Tsuneishi of Nagasaki
University.
   The program's goal was to test the effects of organisms and
toxins responsible for such diseases as tetanus, typhoid,
salmonella, typhus, cholera, tuberculosis for future development of
chemical weapons, Tsuneishi said.
   Researchers subjected POWs to such experiments as injecting
experimental toxins or freezing subjects' arms to determine the
best way of thawing flesh, he said.
   After the war, Ishii, who died several years ago, was questioned
by U.S. occupation authorities but never prosecuted. U.S. officials
said there was insufficient evidence.
   John W. Powell of San Francisco, former editor of an
English-language magazine in China, accused U.S. officials of
protecting those involved in return for the results of the Japanese
experiments.
   He and Tsuneishi also suggested that a virulent strain of
hemorrhagic fever that occurred during the Korean War may have
accidentally or deliberately been introduced by the United States
using organisms acquired from the Japanese.
   Lt. Col. Arnold Williams, chief of the Pentagon press office,
disputed that allegation. Army investigators did look at the
biological warfare research results in 1947, but ``there is no way
of determining if it was used,'' he said.
   Edward Drea, acting chief of the research division of the Army
Center of Military History, said his agency has been unable to
confirm or refute the allegation that American POWs were used in
the Japanese experiments.
   He said there also was no evidence to prove the United States
made any deals with the Japanese in return for the data. ``There's
a difference between allegations and factual evidence, and we just
couldn't find the factual evidence,'' Drea said.
   Joseph C.Y. Chen, a physics professor and Chinese historian at
the University of California at San Diego, presented what he said
was a copy of a Japanese lab report documenting the human
experimentation.
   The report was discovered in a Tokyo bookstore in 1984 by
Japanese researcher Takao Matsumura and reported at that time, Chen
said.
   Since then, historians have obtained additional information
through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, Japanese documents and
interviews with Japanese who helped with the experiments, he said.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said his
country will pay the salaries of former Jordanian employees in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Radio Monte Carlo
reported today.
   Libya ``announces through your radio station that it will take
the responsibility of paying the salaries,'' Gadhafi told the
radio's Paris-based Arabic service. In the interview, conducted
Wednesday by phone, the Libyan leader estimated the cost at about
$1 million a month.
   Jordan has been paying the salaries of 21,200 Palestinians in
the occupied territories but King Hussein announced last week that
he was handing over that responsibility to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   He challenged the PLO to set up a Palestinian state in the West
Bank, where the PLO has been helping lead an 8-month-old uprising
against Israeli rule that has killed nearly 239 Palestinians and
four Israelis.
   Some of Jordan's cuts are being phased in gradually.
   According to Jordanian figures, the salaries were costing around
$45 million a year, but Hussein said only a fraction of those
affected were classified as civil servants.
   The rest worked in institutions that received Jordanian
subsidies.
   Gadhafi did not say how many people's salaries he would pay, but
said he would begin the payments Aug. 16. He also said he supported
the setting up of a Palestinian government-in-exile.
   Asked about Hussein's moves to turn over responsibility for the
occupied territories to the PLO, Gadhafi said the king had never
done anything for Jerusalem, the occupied territories or Palestine
in general.
   In addition to retiring or laying off the employees, Hussein
canceled a proposed $1.3 billion development plan for the occupied
lands, abolished a government ministry responsible for the area and
dissolved the lower house of Parliament, half of whose members were
Palestinian.
   Jordan ruled the West Bank from 1948 until Israel seized it in
1967. Jordan has paid salaries of government workers there and in
the Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Egypt in 1967, but Jordan
claimed sovereignty only over the West Bank.

   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie conferred
with a senior Iranian official on the fate of British hostages in
Lebanon, but said today that ``progress can only be made quietly.''
   The spiritual head of the Church of England met Wednesday night
with an Iranian Foreign Ministry official, Mohamed Reza Said
Mohamedi.
   The meeting was the first known direct meeting between Runcie
and an Iranian envoy on the fate of Runcie's envoy Terry Waite and
other Britons believed held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem extremists.
   In a brief statement issued today at Heathrow Airport before
boarding a flight for a three-week vacation in Philadelphia, Runcie
said:
   ``I believe that everyone who is genuinely concerned about the
improvement of Anglo-Iranian relations and about the British
hostages in Lebanon will recognize that there are times when
progress can only be made quietly.''
   The archbishop refused to elaborate and officials at his London
residence, Lambeth Palace, said no further statement would be
isssued.
   The Iranian Embassy also declined comment and there was no word
on when Mohamedi would leave Britain.
   Lambeth Palace officials also would not comment on earlier
reports that Runcie and Mohamedi has scheduled several meetings for
today.
   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to
secure the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian
extremists.
   Mohamedi, a senior official on the European desk of the Iranian
foreign ministry in Tehran, helped arrange a visit to the Iranian
capital by four British legislators last month.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said the
Wednesday night meeting lasted 75 minutes.
   The talks come as Britain planned its first diplomatic visit to
Iran in a year. First Secretary David Reddaway, a senior official
of the British Foreign Ministry, was scheduled to leave for Tehran
today.
   Reddaway will spend three weeks in the Iranian capital assessing
the possibility of a full-scale resumption of diplomatic ties.
   A British Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, stressed that Mohamedi's talks in London with Runcie had
nothing to do with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government.
   He said they were entirely the affair of church officials.
   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while in Lebanon
seeking the release of foreign hostages there.
   British television journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped April
17, 1986. Brian Keenan _ a teacher from Belfast, Northern Ireland,
with dual British and Irish nationality _ has been missing since
April 11, 1986.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   There are 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Reddaway, who helped Britons escape from the besieged British
Embassy in Tehran in 1980, will report to Mrs. Thatcher's
government on his return to London. Foreign Office Minister Lynda
Chalker said Monday that it was too early to say if Britain would
send an ambassador back to Iran.
   Britain closed its embassy and withdrew its ambassador from
Tehran in 1980 after revolutionary guards stormed the building.
British diplomats then began working out of the Swedish Embassy.
   Last summer, Britain all but broke diplomatic relations with
Tehran after a British diplomat was detained and beaten there in
apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian envoy on
shoplifting charges.
   One Iranian diplomat remains in London.
   Last month, Britain and Iran reached a compensation agreement on
damage to the British Embassy and to the Iranian Embassy in London,
which was damaged in 1980 during a siege by opponents of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.

   Steel bars are the only thing that stand
between William Ernest Kuenzell and his true love.
   The murder suspect said he's found his bride-to-be in an
adjoining cell at the Talladega County jail and vows he won't eat
until he can marry her. The unidentified woman is serving a
four-year sentence for burglary.
   ``It's been a heck of a way to carry on a romance, by hollering
at each other from their jail cells,'' said sheriff's Lt. Charles
Bonner. ``The only time the two see each other is once a week
during Sunday morning church service in one of the courtrooms.''
   Sheriff's investigator Alan Yates said the only other time the
two can glimpse each other is ``if one of them is being escorted up
or down the hall at the jail.''
   The Sheriff's Department has no policy on marriages between
prisoners, but Bonner said he doubted Sheriff Jerry Studdard would
approve such a union. Studdard was out of town and could not be
reached for comment.
   ``We've had marriages performed in the jail before, but it has
always been when an outsider came in to marry a prisoner,'' Bonner
said.
   Kuenzell began his hunger strike Sunday. He appeared in good
health Wednesday, Bonner said.
   ``He is checked twice a week by a doctor. If he continues the
strike and it becomes necessary, we can get a court order to have
him force fed,'' Bonner said.
   Kuenzell is charged in the 1987 shotgun slaying of a convenience
store clerk. His trial is scheduled to begin next week.

   China today said it will ship weapons to the
Khmer Rouge until Vietnam withdraws all its troops from Cambodia.
   The announcement came several weeks after Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the leader of the Cambodian resistance, accused the Khmer
Rouge of killing his followers and threatened to unite with
anti-Khmer Rouge forces to drive them from Cambodia.
   ``So long as Vietnam doesn't withdraw from Cambodia, China will
continue to assist the resistance group, including the Khmer
Rouge,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said today.
   In the past, China has said it would ``respect'' the wishes of
the prince. Today, Jin said China had no comment on Sihanouk's
statements.
   Jin also told a news conference that a date had yet to be set
for talks with the Soviet Union in Beijing on Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and forced the Khmer Rouge
from power. During its four-year rule, the Khmer Rouge killed
millions of Cambodians while pushing a fanatical brand of agrarian
communism.
   In the early 1980s, a three-party resistance group, made up of
Sihanouk; Son Sann, a Western-leaning politician; and the Khmer
Rouge, was established to fight the Vietnamese occupation.
   As the resistance group relied more and more on China and the
capitalist countries of Southeast Asia, Vietnam moved closer to the
Soviet Union.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw its 120,000 troops from Cambodia
by 1991 but wants the Khmer Rouge to play no future role in the
Cambodian government.
   The three-party resistance group held its first meeting with the
Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government in late July in Indonesia.
   Sihanouk went to Indonesia and spoke to those attending the
conference but refused to attend the meeting itself.
   Upon his return to Beijing after the conference, Sihanouk said
it had been a success but chances for peace were slim.
   In previous weeks, he had criticized the Khmer Rouge and said he
was willing to unite with anti-Khmer Rouge factions. The prince is
known for his contradictory statements and for his tendency to
resign as president of the resistance group. He most recently quit
in early July.
   Jin said those who were calling on China to stop supporting the
Khmer Rouge ``would only help the Vietnamese aggressors achieve
their goal in Cambodia.''
   He said China supports a Cambodia that is ``independent,
peaceful and non-aligned.''
   The spokesman said China would not support ``any party
monopolizing power at the expense of any other party,'' a reference
to concerns that the Khmer Rouge will regain power once Vietnam
leaves Cambodia.
   Recent reports have said diplomats from China and the Soviet
Union will meet in Beijing this month to discuss a Cambodian
settlement.
   Jin said he had no information on the meeting, but a Soviet
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting
would occur after Aug. 20 but before the end of the month.
   He said the Soviet Union was waiting for results of a meeting
scheduled Aug. 15 on the Cambodian question between five countries.
Indonesia, Zimbabwe, India, Cuba and Vietnam are scheduled to meet
in Harare, Zimbabwe.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ Angolan rebels claimed new
victories and vowed to continue fighting, even as allied South
African soldiers were reported leaving the country under terms of a
plan to bring peace to the region.
   Angola today rejected direct talks with the rebels, which it
called ``puppets'' of South Africa, and said Angolan troops had
killed 71 rebels in several clashes Aug. 1-7.
   The South African government said about 2,000 of its troops
began leaving Angola Wednesday in accordance with an agreement
aimed at ending the war there and granting independence to
South-West Africa.
   At the same time, UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, said its rebel fighters killed 35
government troops and 15 Cuban soldiers while taking a southwestern
Angolan city and army supply camp.
   The rebels said they took control Tuesday of Chamutete in Huila
province. UNITA said five rebels were killed and 13 injured in
fighting. The claim, in a statement issued in Lisbon, Portugal,
could not be confirmed independently.
   South Africa supports the rebels in their 13-year war. Cuba
supports Angola's Marxist government and has about 50,000 troops in
Angola.
   Under terms of an agreement announced Monday, South Africa is to
have its troops out of Angola by Sept. 1.
   Cuba is eventually to withdraw its troops from Angola, and South
Africa is to grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, where a guerrilla group known as the South-West Africa
People's Organization operates.
   Neither rebel group is party to the agreement.
   In Lisbon, Angola's official Angop news agency said today that
UNITA's exclusion from regional peace talks ``was logical, normal
and necessary for the establishment of peace.''
   But it said this did not rule out a program of amnesty to return
to society ``hundreds of Angolans who were unwittingly used to
serve foreign interests and personal ambitions.''
   Angop said the Angolan army killed 71 ``UNITA bandits'' and took
nine others as prisoners Aug. 1-7. It said rebels in the same
clashes killed 26 government troops and captured 17.
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe said President
Eduardo dos Santos of Angola told the leaders of black-governed
nations neighboring South Africa that a timetable for the
withdrawal of the Cuban troops is still to be worked out. ``It is
not going to start now. It will start much later, perhaps after six
to eight months,'' Mugabe said.
   Officials of Angola, Cuba and South Africa are to meet in two
weeks to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the Cuban troops.
   The Citizen and other South African newspapers said South
African soldiers had begun dismantling a forward base at Cuito
Cuanavale, in southern Angola, gathering up battle wreckage and
preparing long-range G-5 guns for the 180-mile journey through
dense bush and sand back to South-West Africa.
   Cuito Cuanavale, once an Angolan government garrison town, has
been a no-man's land between dueling artillery for the past eight
months.
   If agreement on Cuban withdrawal is reached, South Africa says
it will set Nov. 1 as the starting date for implementing a U.N.
plan to end its 73-year rule over South-West Africa.
   The plan envisions a 7,500-man U.N. peacekeeping force to be
deployed in Namibia for seven months while South African troops
gradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to draft
a post-independence constituion.
   Estimates of the cost of the U.N. operation have ranged as high
as $1 billion. If the implementation process begins Nov. 1,
elections could take place as early as June 1.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich will recommend expanding
Minnesota's school-choice plan to other states when he becomes the
chairman of a national education group on Saturday, and the plan
already is drawing opposition.
   Perpich's plan allows parents and students to choose their
schools regardless of where they live and puts schools in
competition for those students.
   Several members of the policy and priorities committee of the
Education Commission of the States objected to the proposal
Wednesday at the organization's annual meeting in Baltimore.
   Critics told Perpich the plan would sharpen disparities between
poor and wealthy districts rather than increase opportunities for
equal education for all.
   ``What you're going to end up with is very, very good schools
and very, very mediocre schools. ... I think the charge is to make
all schools great,'' said Colorado state Sen. Regis Groff.
   Perpich is defending the plan, which encountered opposition
before its 1987 adoption in Minnesota.
   ``Together we must work toward the day when parents and students
have the freedom to choose a school on the basis of its excellence
instead of its geographical location,'' Perpich said in the text of
a speech to be given give Saturday when he succeeds Missouri Gov.
John Ashcroft as commission chairman.
   ``The failure of our schools to provide equal access to
educational excellence is creating a situation that, if trends
continue, will force businesses to hire more than a million new
service and production workers every year who can't read, write or
count.''
   He estimated that it costs business up to $25 billion a year in
fees and lost productivity to educate those workers.

   Michael Dukakis today lauded President Reagan
for reaching arms agreements with the Soviet Union but said his
space-based defense plan should be scrapped in favor of beefing up
conventional forces.
   The Democratic presidential nominee, in a speech at New York
University, did not mention Republican challenger George Bush by
name but made it clear he believed Bush would continue defense
policies that Dukakis said had benefitted greedy contractors at the
expense of national security.
   ``We've got to have a real leader in the White House who will
insist that when it comes to our national security we're going to
make our decisions based not on what's good for one company or one
military service or one political party but on what's good for
America,'' Dukakis said in his prepared text.
   ``My friends, the test of a successful defense policy isn't how
much money we spend; it's how much security we buy,'' Dukakis said.
``And for the past eight years, we haven't gotten what we've gone
into debt for.''
   Dukakis said that if elected he would seek to expand on the arms
agreements negotiated with the Soviets by Reagan but promised to
``judge Soviet leaders not by what they say but what they do.''
   Dukakis promised to ``clean up the mess'' in Pentagon
procurement policies and redirect defense dollars from the
``seemingly endless development of new and more expensive nuclear
weapons systems,'' a reference to the president's Star Wars missile
defense program, to new tanks and other supplies for conventional
forces and the Coast Guard.
   ``We have to build strong military forces based on sound
planning and tough management, not wishful thinking and blank
checks,'' Dukakis sad.
   He said the choice in November presented ``the opportunity to
restore America's leadership in the world. Or we can settle for
second best.''
   The speech came at the beginning of a five-state campaign swing.
From New York, the Massachusetts governor was traveling to New
Jersey to tour Fort Dix.
   Dukakis also had evening appearances scheduled in two
Connecticut communities before heading to Richmond, Va., to spend
the night at the governor's mansion. He was to campaign in Virginia
and Florida on Friday before spending the weekend on Cape Cod.
   The Massachusetts governor on Wednesday tended to state
business, including a groundbreaking ceremony that was part of a $6
billion effort to clean up Boston Harbor, the nation's filthiest.
   Dukakis balked at spending money for new sewage treatment plants
during his first term as governor in the mid-1970s, but said it was
``revisionist history'' to blame him for delays in beginning the
cleanup.
   ``Nobody could really tell us what to do to clean up this
place,'' Dukakis said. ``There were very respected people, experts
in the field, who disagreed.''
   But the state now faces a federal court timetable to stop
polluting the harbor by 1999, with several deadlines relating to
sewage treatment and sludge dumping spread throughout the next
decade.
   The cleanup is the largest public works project in Massachusetts
history, and Dukakis, as he did last week in California, boasted of
the jobs it would create.
   But Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, took Dukakis to task
on the cleanup.
   ``If it takes the governor of Massachusetts 11 years to clean up
his own harbor, Americans must question his commitment to the even
larger environmental questions which face our nation,'' he said.
   Atwater said the delay will cause the average Boston water bill
to skyrocket over the next eight years.
   A Gallup survey released Tuesday put Dukakis' support at 49
percent and Bush's at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1,004
registered voters Aug. 5-7. A Gallup poll just two weeks ago gave
Dukakis a 17-point margin _ 54 percent to 37 percent. Each survey
had a 3 percentage point margin of error.
   ``The race has always been tight,'' Dukakis said in shrugging
off the new numbers. ``This is going to be a very tough,
competitive 90 days.''
   ``The only thing that these numbers tell you is that the
Democratic ticket is competitive in every region of the country and
in every state of the country,'' he said.

tour boat that sank in a storm, the Middle East News Agency said.
Twenty-four people remained missing.
   The state-owned agency quoted police Gen. Ibrahim Bassiouny,
head of security of Aswan, 600 miles south of Cairo, as saying the
nine bodies were found when the search resumed this morning.
   The steamer Nubia was sailing from Aswan to Luxor on Wednesday
when the storm hit and it capsized and sank. It was carrying 51
Italians and an Egyptian crew of 45.
   Both Luxor and Aswan are favorite tourist resorts. Luxor is
famed for its Valley of the Kings Pharaonic necropolis and the
Karnak temple complex.
   An Italian Embassy spokesman in Cairo said 35 Italians were
rescued, some suffering minor injuries and shock, on Wednesday.
   Twenty-seven Egyptian crewmen also were rescued on Wednesday and
the body of one was picked up from the water.
   The Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram said most of the tourists were
below deck in their cabins when the boat sank.
   The paper quoted skipper Mohammed Ahmed Ibrahim, who was
injured, as saying the boat sank because of the strong currents
resulting from the storm.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted tour director Paolo Fissora
as saying, ``An extremely violent storm arrived all of a sudden,
and in 30 seconds, the huge ship had gone to the bottom.
   ``I don't remember it all very well. In just a few minutes, I
found myself in the water,'' Fissora told ANSA in a telephone
interview.
   Italian ambassador Giovanni Migliuolo and senior Egyptian
security men immediately rushed to the scene. Egyptian divers were
flown to the site to search for the missing.
   The embassy spokesman said most of the Italian survivors had
flown back to Italy from Luxor on a chartered plane. He said one or
two of them with relatives or friends among the missing opted to
stay.

<HEAD>Printer Fires Three More Employees In Business Week Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company that prints Business Week magazine says
it has fired three more production workers and exhausted all leads
in its investigation of employees who leaked advance copies of an
influential column.
   Investigators believe the leaked information was used to buy and
sell stocks to take advantage of changes in their price after the
magazine came out.
   ``We're not totally sure that it's all over,'' R.R. Donnelley &
Sons spokesman Arthur Prine said Wednesday. ``We're not pursuing
any new leads at this moment. If any more evidence or leads turn
up, we'll be investigating them.''
   The firings late last week at the company's Old Saybrook, Conn.,
plant brought to seven the number of Donnelley employees who have
either been fired or resigned in connection with the company's
investigation.
   No criminal charges have been filed. The Chicago-based company
said it is considering pressing charges for theft.
   Investigations of the scandal also have resulted in firings or
resignations of several stockbrokers.
   Prine said Donnelley would continue to cooperate with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in its investigation.
   The latest three workers fired were involved in passing advance
copies of Business Week to William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &
Co. stockbroker who allegedly traded on the information in the
``Inside Wall Street'' column, Prine said.
   Donnelley earlier fired two other workers at the Old Saybrook
plant and fired a quality-control supervisor at its Torrance,
Calif., plant suspected of trading in Business Week-touted stocks.
   A Donnelley production supervisor in Torrance who also bought
and sold stocks mentioned in the column resigned, the company said.
   Federal authorities are investigating to determine whether laws
were broken. Buying and selling stocks on information unavailable
to the public is insider trading and constitutes fraud under
federal securities laws.

<TEXT>
   Military authorities today told
Moslem kidnappers to release an American and his Filipino wife
within 24 hours or face military attack, the state-run news agency
reported.
   The Philippine News Agency quoted Col. Eduardo Resos, army
provincial commander, as saying the military has pinpointed where
the kidnappers took David Blair Stiffler, a New York construction
worker, and his wife, Elpidia.
   The Stifflers were abducted at gunpoint on July 30 by Moslem
bandits while aboard a van near Marawi, 510 miles south of Manila.
Lanao del Sur is known as a lawless province where numerous
kidnappings occured in the past.
   The report said efforts by civilian negotiators to get the
kidnappers to free their hostages had bogged down. The civilian
officials gave the kidnappers until noon today to free the couple,
but the kidnappers ignored the deadline.
   The military issued a similar ultimatum, then extended the
deadline to noon Friday (midnight EDT tonight).
   Resos said troops have sealed off all exits points and have
brought in artillery and helicopters for possible rescue operations.
   ``We are still hoping that the kidnappers will come to their
senses and relase their hostages in the name of peace,'' the agency
quoted Resos as saying.
   There are no telephone lines to Marawi. In the past the military
has issued ultimatums but extended them after they elapsed.

   George Bush is forming an organization of
black supporters in his effort to win minority voters who twice
shied from Ronald Reagan but may be disenchanted with Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   The vice president later today was to announce a group known as
the National Black Americans for Bush. Campaign aides said it would
include about 100 blacks, including officeholders and prominent
black Republicans.
   Trying to make more inroads among minority groups than President
Reagan did in 1980 and 1984, the vice president has been taking
tentative stck voters in recent weeks.
   At several campaign appearances before black audiences, he has
hinted that he would enforce civil rights more aggressively thaneps to
court bla
the Reagan administration has done.
   He also has criticized Dukakis' handling of defeated Democratic
rival Jesse Jackson, claiming, ``He could have done a little more
in terms of sensitivity.''
   And earlier this week, Bush praised Jackson for focusing
attention on the drug problem in the 1988 campaign, suggesting
Jackson might be offered a place in a Bush administration.
   ``We detect a real re-evaluation of the one-party tradition of
black voters,'' said camively traded blue chips, International Business

<HEAD>Jesse James' Grandaughter Donates Boots, Guns to Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last surviving grandaughter
of Jesse James has given away some priceless family heirlooms,
including guns and the pair of handmade boots the outlaw wore when
he was shot to death in 1882.
   The artifacts went on display last week at the Jesse James
Museum at the James Farm historic site near Kearney, Mo. The museum
and family farm, now owned by Clay County, are about 30 miles
northeast of Kansas City.
   Ethel Rose Owens, 80, said Wednesday that her father, Jesse
Edward James, was 7 years old when his notorious father was killed
in St. Joseph, Mo., by Robert Ford, a newcomer to the James gang.
   ``He was in the next room,'' Mrs. Owens said. ``He ran into the
next room and saw his father lying there all bloody. ... I think my
father never got over that.''
   The artifacts, which include Jesse James' Winchester rifle, a
shotgun and pistol, had been closely guarded by the James family
for generations to keep the items from becoming part of a
``sideshow,'' Mrs. Owens said.
   Also included in the donation were Jesse James' spurs, wallet
and coin purse, his horse bridle and a boot-polishing brush.
   She said she was persuaded to donate the heirlooms last year
during a trip to the family farm with her nephew, Orange County
Superior Court Judge James Ross.
   The family's bitterness toward curiosity seekers was
well-documented in the years following James' death, said Milton
Perry, Clay County curator of historic sites.
   James' widow once told a newspaper she would never sell anything
that belonged to the outlaw, saying ``You can offer me a $1,000,''
_ ``which was a lot of money at the time,'' Perry said by telephone
from his home in Kansas City.
   Mrs. Owens and others said they were particularly amused at the
irony upon learning that the Pinkerton security agency volunteered
to stand guard at the museum Friday, the first night the James'
artifacts went on display.
   ``They were more successful at guarding, I think, than they were
at catching Frank and Jesse James,'' Perry said.

<HEAD>Governors Announce Action; Debris Washes Up From Great Lakes To
Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th pvs `Officials were...' to UPDATE

<TEXT>
   With summer already spoiled for thousands of beach-goers, New
York and New Jersey announced cradle-to-grave accounting of
infectious medical waste to help curb debris that has washed ashore
from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We will no longer tolerate the careless, unsupervised and
often just outrageous way these wastes are being handled,'' New
Jersey Gov. Tom Kean said Wednesday at a crowded shipboard news
conference in New York Harbor.
   In North Carolina, meanwhile, 40 Marines landed on 26 miles of
beaches this week for the unheroic task of clearing bags of medical
and other waste dumped by Navy vessels offshore.
   Officials were investigating whether the dumping was illegal.
CBS News reported Wednesday that the ships were outside the 25-mile
legal trash-dumping limit. Medical refuse, however, is usually held
for incineration in port, said Navy spokesman Lt. John Lloyd.
   The Navy has traced some of the debris to the USS Newport and
USS Nassau and is examining deck logs to determine where the ships
were when the trash went overboard, Lloyd said.
   ``Right now we don't know if there were any violations,'' Lloyd
said. ``We really don't know how it happened. We know we're
responsible for it. We're just trying to find out how it got
ashore.''
   Blood-stained syringes, blood bags, bandages, vials of drugs and
other medical debris, including dead rodents, have closed numerous
beaches this summer in New York and New Jersey, and alarmed
officials in other Atlantic coastal states like Florida and South
Carolina.
   ``In my 10 years here I've never seen anything like this wash
up,'' said Police Chief Jack E. Lilienthal in Charleston, S.C.,
close to where a syringe and plunger without a needle and a medical
glove were found Wednesday.
   In Cleveland, hundreds of syringes, many blood-stained, have
been found during the past week on public and private beaches along
Lake Erie. Richard L. Shank, director of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, called the problem ``disgusting and heinous,''
and said direct dumping in the lake was illegal.
   The waste accounting plan launche by New York and New Jersey,
which goes into effect immediately, was announced following a
monthlong rash of beach closings in both states due to medical
waste and raw sewage in the water.
   ``The purpose is to say to people, we will watch you with the
intent of catching and prosecuting you if this waste is not
disposed of properly,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   As part of the plan, hospitals and other facilities that
generate medical waste, transport it or dispose of it will be
required to fill out forms at each step of the process.
   The hospital will then keep the final form on file for the
state, providing a record of the waste from inception to disposal.
If the hospital does not receive the form within seven days of
disposal, the state must be notified.
   ``We are powerless no longer as needles and bandages wash up on
our beaches,'' said Kean. ``We will be able to punish the people
who have been turning so many holidays into horror stories.''
   Beach attendance has been down significantly in both states due
to the pollutions, officials have said.
   Kean and Cuomo acknowledged the new ``manifest system'' did not
carry any stricter penalties for illegal dumpers _ it simply would
make it easier to catch them.
   Steven Romalewski, Long Island toxics campaign coordinator for
the New York Public Interest Group, criticized the plan as ``too
little, too late.''
   ``If the governor is making a stab at solving the medical waste
problem, this is a pathetic effort,'' said Romalewski, whose group
wants more legislative action. ``The people of New York should not
accept this.''
   Syringes, vials of drugs and other medical debris have also
washed ashore from the Gulf of Mexico onto beaches in Florida's
Panhandle during the past several weeks, especially in recent days
because of Tropical Storm Beryl, authorities said Wednesday. But
Escambia County, Fla.'s environmental health director, Richard
Dunlap, said there was no cause for alarm from a health standpoint.
   ``It's medical waste; it's not infectious waste,'' he said.
``The storm has brought in so much stuff (in addition to medical
debris).''

   Banks in Taiwan will be allowed to issue
credit cards, the government announced today.
   The United States has urged Taiwan to allow credit cards as part
of a program to open financial markets.
   Jacob Chao, general manager of American Express International
(Taiwan) Inc., said his company had sought permission to issue
credit cards in Taiwan for five years.
   Local banks have been allowed to issue only debit cards, which
draw on funds already deposited. Businesses are not restricted from
accepting credit cards from foreign customers.
   Wang Chao-ming, spokesman for the government's Council for
Economic Planning and Development, made the announcement. He said
the government planned two years ago to let banks issue credit
cards but delayed the move because of concern it might lead to an
outflow of foreign reserves to overseas credit card companies.
Taiwan has $71 billion in foreign reserves.
   The new rules will take effect after a formal announcement by
the Finance Ministry. No date for that announcement was set.

<TEXT>
   A small group of protesters picketed and prayed
outside a Toronto movie theater when Martin Scorsese's film, ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' debuted in Canada at a special preview
screening.
   ``Martin Scorsese is crucifying Christ again on celluloid,''
said Gary Gould, one of a dozen people at the demonstration
Wednesday night.
   Roman Catholic women chanted the rosary and three male Baptists
carried signs saying ``Read The True Story'' and ``Once Was
Enough.'' The evangelical organization Renaissance Canada urged
federal Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn to ban the film as ``hate
literature'' under the Criminal Code.
   None of the protesters had seen the movie, which opens to the
public on Friday.
   Canada's leading critic, Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail,
strongly defended the film. He began a half-page review by saying
the film was not, as some have alleged, ``disrespectful,
irreverent, blasphemous or anti-religious.''
   He termed it an intense exploration of the conflict between
spirit and flesh, and a ``courageous film that people of all
religions or no religion should be able to watch with identical
fascination.''
   Scorsese attended Wednesday's screening, a benefit for the
Canadian Center for Advanced Film Studies. The center was founded
by Norman Jewison, who directed the controversial ``Jesus Christ
Superstar.''

<HEAD>Gloves Come Off in Suburban Atlanta Congressional Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just hours after former actor Ben Jones won the
Democratic nomination for Congress, the gloves came off in the race
for the suburban Atlanta seat, with incumbent Pat Swindall raising
the issue of Jones' past alcoholism.
   Jones, 46, who appeared on the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' TV series,
branded Swindall's remarks a ploy to divert attention from the
Republican's admission that he considered accepting laundered drug
money to finance an expensive home.
   ``He's obviously trying to deflect attention from his own
problems of the present by dealing with problems of my past,''
Jones said Wednesday.
   The race heated up Wednesday, the day after Jones soundly
defeated two challengers to win the 4th District's Democratic
nomination a second time. Two years ago, Jones got 47 percent of
the vote in losing to Swindall.
   Swindall, who was unopposed for the GOP nomination, sent a
letter to Jones Wednesday congratulating him and saying that before
the two debate, ``several issues regarding your qualifications for
office'' must be resolved.
   Specifically, Swindall raised ``the issue of your alcoholism and
past arrests'' and asked Jones for copies of his arrest and health
records by Friday.
   Jones in turn suggested Swindall ``meet me at Emory Hospital on
Friday and that we have a complete physical and mental evaluation''
as well as random drug testing throughout the campaign.
   Swindall said Wednesday night he would not oblige Jones. Jones
said his arrest records are part of the public record and Swindall
could obtain them himself.
   The former actor said that he has not taken a drink since 1977
and that he has often spoke to church and student groups about his
alcoholism.
   He was arrested several times during his drinking days on
misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges.
   He said his driving record included speeding tickets and driving
with an expired license, but that he has never been arrested for
drunken driving.
   Swindall was charged with drunken driving in 1980 but records
indicate he was not prosecuted because of insufficient evidence.
Earlier this year, it was learned that Swindall was involved in an
undercover money-laundering investigation.
   A government videotape showed Swindall pursuing an $850,000 loan
_ even after learning it might be financed with drug money _ until
he was told by a man later identified as a federal agent that
Swindall would have to accept the proceeds in person and sign a
receipt.
   Swindall said later he was ``embarrassed and ashamed'' that he
considered accepting the loan but said he did not violate any law
because he did not take the money. He has asked the House Ethics
Committee to investigate his actions.

   Militant ultra-Orthodox Israelis planted five
bombs in a Tel Aviv suburb today to protest the sale of secular
newspapers, police said.
   Three exploded but caused no injuries. Police said the bombs
went off before dawn near newspaper stands selling secular dailies
in the Bnei Brak suburb, most of whose residents are observant Jews.
   Two other bombs were discovered and dismantled near the homes of
two shop owners who sell secular newspapers, police spokeswoman
Dalia Gilad said.
   Mrs. Gilad said a radical, Jerusalem-based, ultra-Orthodox group
claimed responsibility for the explosions in calls to Israeli
newspapers and the shopkeepers themselves.
   ``They gave the exact location of the bombs,'' Mrs. Gilad said.
The callers said they were protesting the sale of secular
newspapers, she reported.
   In the past, the group has painted slogans on the tombstones of
Israel's founding fathers in Jerusalem. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews
are anti-Zionist and believe Israel should have been founded only
after the coming of the Messiah.
   ``It's a miracle there were no casualties and property damage
was so small,'' Israel radio quoted local police Commander Arie
Amit as saying.
   Mrs. Gilad said large police forces searched Bnei Brak for other
bombs.

<HEAD>High Court Says Anti-Nuke Question Can Go On Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' Supreme Court today ruled that a
measure that could close the state's two commercial nuclear plants
can go on the ballot in November.
   By a vote of 3-2, the court affirmed Attorney General James
Shannon's view that the question could properly be placed before
the voters.
   The high court had considered whether the ballot question, if
passed, constituted an illegal ``taking'' of private property
without compensation.
   The measure would prohibit the generation of electricity ``by
means which result in the production of nuclear waste'' after July
4, 1989.
   The power plants that could be affected are Boston Edison Co.'s
Pilgrim plant in Plymouth and Yankee Atomic Electric Co.'s plant in
Rowe.
   Shannon had argued in court papers that the ballot question
``does not, either facially or implicitly, exercise the power of
eminent domain or mandate a physical taking or invasion of private
property.''
   He noted that ``proponents assert that the property could be
converted to another power source, used for a low-level waste
repository, or used for other commercial purposes.''

   Here are provisions of the drought relief bill
that President Reagan signed today.
   The new law:
   _ Authorizes $3.9 billion for relief for drought-stricken
farmers.
   _ Provides payments for farmers who lose more than 35 percent of
their crops because of drought, hail, excessive moisture and
related problems.
   _ Furnishes 65 percent of income lost from damage to the portion
of the farmer's harvest exceeding the 35 percent level, and
provides 90 percent of income lost from damage to the portion of
the crop exceeding the 75 percent level.
   _ Combines two existing livestock feed assistance programs and
streamlines machinery for making it available to farmers who
otherwise would produce their own feed.
   _ Caps benefits at $100,000 for each individual. Bars benefits
for those with $2 million or more a year in gross farm income.
   _ Requires that those who receive crop loss benefits must
purchase federal crop insurance next year if their losses this year
total more than 65 percent.
   _ Provides that farmers will not have to return income-support
payments received in advance if their losses represent less than 35
percent of their crop. This helps producers whose payment level has
been lowered by drought.
   _ Requires producers receiving disaster benefits on 35 percent
to 100 percent of their crop to repay these advance income-support,
or ``deficiency,'' payments but not until July 31, 1989.
   _ Blocks an increase of 50 cents for each 100 pounds of weight
in the dairy price-support level that was scheduled for January.
Increases the level by 50 cents a hundredweight for April, May and
June of next year.
   _ Allows the Agriculture Department to sell corn to ethanol
producers at reduced prices but limit participation to producers
who use no more than 30 million bushels of ethanol annually. The
secretary of agriculture is free not to implement the program.

   The U.S. Postal Service is issuing a block of
commemorative stamps honoring four American explorers of the
Antarctic.
   Nathaniel B. Palmer, Charles Wilkes, Richard E. Byrd and Lincoln
Ellsworth will be pictured on stamps to be issued Sept. 14 in
ceremonies at the National Geographic Society in Washington.
   Palmer was the first American to view Antarctica, discovering
the peninsula that bears his name in 1820. Wilkes led an expedition
in 1836-1843 that proved Antarctica to be a separate continent.
   Perhaps the best-known American explorer of the Antarctic, Byrd
conducted five expdeditions to the region and organized
photographic mapping of the continent by air in the 1920s and `30s.
   Ellsworth led four expeditions southward in the 1930s and was
the first person to fly over both the Arctic and Antarctic.

<HEAD>PLO Leaders Disagree On Jordan's West Bank Move</HEAD>

   Top aides of PLO leader Yasser
Arafat disagreed over the implications of Jordan's move to cut ties
to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, with one calling
it a violation of Arab trust.
   ``It is regrettable that the move was taken at the start of an
international political vacuum (that prevails) from here till after
the American elections,'' Khaled Al-Hassan said in an interview
published today in the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat.
   ``Jordan was committed by Arab summit resolutions to certain
obligations toward the West Bank until the land is liberated. ...
The legal and administrative disengagement is a violation of those
commitments,'' he said.
   Al-Hassan is member of the central committee of Fatah, the
leadership of the main guerrilla group under the PLO umbrella.
   But in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, Arafat's right-hand
man in Fatah, Salah Khalaf, was quoted as saying: ``It is a
courageous decision, and enables the Palestine Liberation
Organization to shoulder its responsibility and take over new
political rights.''
   The statements by Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, were published
in the newspaper Al-Bayan of Dubai.
   In his first comments on the move, made this week to Al-Sharq
Al-Awsat, Arafat expressed anger that King Hussein of Jordan had
acted without consulting the PLO. He also criticized the timing of
the move but would not talk at length ``so as not to explode
relations with Jordan.''
   However, a rival Palestinian group charged today that Arafat was
well aware of the measures before the king announced them.
   In Damascus, a spokesman, Fatah-Uprising, another faction led by
Col. Abu Mousa, said the group has ``information that contacts took
place between King Hussein and Yasser Arafat on the eve of
announcing the Jordanian decision ... contrary to what the PLO
claimed about not having been consulted in advance.''
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the
group was staunchly opposed to forming a Palestinian
government-in-exile.
   Hussein's measures, which cut Jordan's political and
administrative links with 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, left an administrative vacuum in the
Israeli-occupied areas.
   Palestinians in the areas have been rioting against Israeli
military rule for the past eight months. Nearly 240 Palestinians
and four Israelis have been killed since the violence began Dec 8.
   The PLO seeks an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, both seized by Israel in June 1967.
   Al-Hassan also told Al-Sharq Al-Awsat the PLO was not consulted
before Jordan acted. ``This step casts thick shadows on the
relationship of Palestinian-Jordanian partnership,'' he said.
   He said problems would develop when government employees who no
longer receive salaries from Jordan seek other jobs and those who
used to have Jordanian passports seek other travel documents.
   ``The move has political implications that could have grave
implications for others than the PLO,'' he said. He did not
elaborate.

   A Navy flier was missing at sea and presumed
dead today after a helicopter crashed off the coast, injuring three
crewmembers, authorities said.
   The SH-2F Seasprite anti-submarine helicopter, assigned to North
Island Naval Air Station in San Diego, crashed during a training
flight Wednesday approximately 35 miles south of San Clemente
Island, the Navy said.
   The cause of the accident was unknown and would be investigated,
the Navy said. The copter is manufactured by Kaman Corp. of
Bloomfield, Conn.
   Lt. j.g. Walter S. Hogan, 27, of Tucson, Ariz., was missing and
presumed dead, said Ken Mitchell, a base spokesman. A search
continued until dusk Wednesday.
   The pilot, Naval Reserve Lt. Mark S. Eoff, 33, of San Diego, was
listed in critical condition at Balboa Naval Hospital with
unspecified injuries.
   The two enlisted crew members, Petty Officer 3rd Class John C.
Santana, 22, of New York, and Airman Steven P. Zelasco, 21, of
Virginia, Minn., were listed as stable.

comment</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said
today the Reagan White House has lost all credibility by brushing
aside efforts to obtain a broad bipartisan consensus on aid to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   ``It's all take and no give with this White House,'' Byrd, still
fuming after Wednesday's Contra votes, told reporters this morning.
``Its credibility _ what little it had _ must be gone by now. It
left the Contras high and dry.''
   Senate Republicans say they refused to vote for a Democratic
Contra aid plan because it did not represent a truly bipartisan
approach and could not guarantee aid would reach the rebels inside
Nicaragua.
   No Republicans joined the majority when the Senate voted 49-47
for a Democratic proposal to provide the Contras with $27 million
in non-lethal ``humanitarian'' aid after Oct. 1 and to set the
stage for a second vote on the possible resumption of $16.3 million
in stockpiled military aid later in the year.
   ``I'm sick and tired of a White House that has no steel in its
guts,'' Byrd declared moments after the vote.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the White
House's handling of the issue, saying, ``They were aware of our
position, but the vote is history. The bill is out there.''
   ``We accept the outcome and go from here,'' Fitzwater said.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., one of the strongest and most
consistent Democratic supporters of Contra aid, said that after the
defeat of a rival GOP proposal, the Democratic plan offered the
only possibility that military aid to the Contras ever will be
resumed by the current Congress.
   He contended that after the Senate voted 57-39 to defeat the aid
amendment offered by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a
``one-line letter'' from Reagan endorsing the Democratic plan would
have been enough to secure widespread Republican support.
   Dole's plan would have made the $16.3 million in stockpiled arms
available immediately to the Contras _ who oppose Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government _ without a second vote in the House
and Senate.
   ``The moment came for the White House to send a signal,'' Boren
said.
   ``And we waited. And I called. And I knew that letter was going
to come because I trusted them.
   ``And the letter didn't come.
   ``There is only one word that explains it,'' Boren said, ``and
that one word is _ politics.''
   Vice President George Bush has attempted to exploit the
different positions taken on the issue by Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas.
   Dukakis has opposed the provision of lethal aid to the Contras;
Bentsen has voted for it in the past.
   Dole told the Senate that many of his GOP colleagues believe the
Democratic plan was intended as ``an umbrella, a cover'' for the
Democratic presidential ticket and for Democratic candidates who
have opposed Contra aid in the past.
   But Boren called the collapse of the effort to build bipartisan
unity on the Contra issue ``a tragically missed opportunity for the
United States of America.''
   ``I predict it will set back the peace process,'' he said. ``I
predict it will set back the cause of the resistance.''
   Many Republican senators criticized the plan, offered by Byrd as
an amendment to a military appropriations bill, because they said
they did not trust House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas to keep his
promise to permit a later vote to release the military aid, if the
president requested that action.
   Boren, Byrd and others said that Wright's pledge, made in a
phone call to Republican as well as Democratic senators, was of
such ``high visibility'' that he could not renege on it.
   ``You can inscribe your name in blood on a shaft of marble and
they still won't believe you,'' Byrd said of his attempts to
convince Republicans that Democrats were sincere in pursuing a
process that could lead to the resumption of arms shipments to the
Contras.
   ``They won't listen to reason,'' he said. ``They are suspicious
of everybody. They are paranoid. I can't understand that kind of
person in the United States Senate.''
   Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., replying to the Democratic
criticism, said of Byrd: ``The answer why Republicans didn't
support his plan was because we didn't think it was a bipartisan
plan.''
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Dole
proposal ``would have provided solid support and a reliable,
deliverable system for the aid.''
   He said the Byrd amendment was ``only minimally acceptable.''
   Fitzwater said the Reagan administration now hopes the Byrd
amendment will be changed in a conference with the House.

   A teen-ager who pleaded guilty to riot in the
Howard Beach racial attack that left a black man dead has been
placed on five years' probation.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos imposed the sentence
Wednesday on Harry Buonocore, 19. Buonocore accepted the plea
bargain before the start of the second trial to result from the
attack in the Queens neighborhood in 1986.
   Three teen-agers were convicted of manslaughter in the first
trial in the death of Michael Griffith, who was struck and killed
by a car while fleeing the gang of whites that had attacked him and
two other black men.
   Three of the five defendants in the second trial were convicted
last month of riot. They face up to a year in jail at sentencing
next month.

<TEXT>
   Jim Thompson need not take time to stop
and smell the flowers _ he'll be paying someone else upwards of
$20,000 to handle that.
   Thompson, who plans to add a pool to his 10-acre Oakland Hills
Tennis Club, was told by the city Planning Commission Wednesday he
must have a botanist on duty during the project because of a nearby
patch of endangered wildflowers.
   The patch is only one of three known sites in the world for the
white and maroon Clarkia franciscana.
   ``I'm very privileged to have it on my land,'' Thompson said,
``but it's more of a nuisance than anything.''
   The botanist _ who at $100 an hour Thompson figures may cost as
much as $20,000 _ would have to stay during excavation and concrete
pouring for the pool, which is 20 feet from the wildflowers.
   ``With what it's costing,'' said Michael Dean, his attorney, ``I
told him maybe he should charge admission for people to see it.''
   Clarkia, an annual, blooms in the spring. In the heat of summer
it withers, leaving seeds behind.
   ``They won't even be out when we're building,'' Thompson said.
``You won't even be able to tell they're there.''
   Clarkia, known as the Presidio Clarkia, was discovered at the
Army's Presidio base in San Francisco in 1958. It is one of 187
plants on the state's endangered species list and a candidate for
the federal government's list.
   ``You never know,'' said Jim Burns, Thompson's architect.
``There might be a future cure for cancer found in that plant.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today rejected a
proposal by right-wing groups that Israel annex the occupied
territories now that Jordan has cut administrative ties to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir said in an interview with Israel's armed forces radio
that the status of the territories, which are home to 1.5 million
Palestinians, should be subject to peace negotiations with
Palestinians who don't belong to or identify with the PLO.
   ``We honor our international obligations and we shall not make
any unilateral step, like imposing Israeli rule on the territories
that are subject to negotiations,'' Shamir said.
   He was referring to the 1978 U.S.-negotiated Camp David accords
between Egypt and Israel, which call for five years of autonomy for
Palestinians before negotiations on the final status of land
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinians oppose any solution short of an independent state
and have demanded that any settlement be negotiated with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Last week, King Hussein abandoned any Jordanian claims to the
West Bank, challenging the PLO to set up a Palestinian state in the
occupied lands, where it has been leading an 8-month-old uprising.
Hussein also laid off about 21,000 employees paid by Jordan in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat's top aides disagreed over the move, with one calling it
a violation of Arab trust.
   ``Jordan was committed by Arab summit resolutions to certain
obligations toward the West Bank until the land is liberated,''
Khaled Al-Hassan said in an interview published today in the Saudi
Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat.
   Al-Hassan is member of the central committee of Fatah, the
leadership of the main guerrilla group under the PLO umbrella.
   But the Al-Bayan newspaper of neighboring Dubai quoted Arafat's
right-hand man in Fatah, Salah Khalaf, as saying the ``courageous
decision'' allows the PLO to ``shoulder its responsibility and take
over new political rights.''
   Arafat has expressed anger that Hussein did not consult the PLO
before cutting ties. But an anonymous spokesman for the rival
Fatah-Uprising, led by Col. Abu Mousa, said in Damascus that
Hussein and Arafat conferred the day before the decision was
announced.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said his country will pay the
salaries of former Jordanian workers in the occupied lands, Radio
Monte Carlo reported today.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, declined comment except to say it was ``very
hypothetical'' to consider whether Israel would allow any other
Arab country to send money into the territories.
   Shamir ruled out talks with the PLO. ``We would not talk to the
PLO because the PLO is not interested in peace and has not deviated
until today from its ideology of destroying Israel,'' he said.
   ``We are ready to talk with Palestinian Arabs who are not PLO
members. We are teady to talk with Jordan or without Jordan ... I
mean real Palestinian Arabs who are not PLO members.''
   Shamir has been under pressure from his own Likud Bloc and
allied right-wing parties to extend Israeli law to the West Bank
and Gaza, which the right wing considers an integral part of the
ancient land of Israel.
   The Arab uprising began Dec. 8 and has claimed the lives of 239
Palestinians and four Israelis.
   The latest victim was 17-year-old Ahmed Salah Darameh of Tubas
on the West Bank, who died of bullet wounds Wednesday night.
   A military spokesman said a security man accompanying a military
truck fired shots after youths threatened the truck by hurling
rocks at it.
   Also Wednesday, an Israeli soldier was burned in the face and
hands by a firebomb thrown at a military jeep in the West Bank city
of Ramallah. An Arab woman also was slightly burned on the leg in
the attack, the army said.

<HEAD>NRC Proposes Fining Peach Bottom Plant $1.25 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today
proposed the largest fine in its history _ $1.25 million _ because
operators at Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom nuclear plant slept on the
job.
   In addition, the NRC said it would fine 33 present or former
operators at Philadelphia Electric Co., the first time the
commission has ever imposed civil penalties for individual
operators. The fines will range from $500 to $1,000.
   The operators are being fined for ``sleeping and@or other acts
of inattention to duty'' at Peach Bottom, on the Susquehanna River
near the Pennsylvania-Maryland line, the NRC said.
   The NRC called the $1.25 million a proposed fine because it said
the company ``has a chance to protest it in in whole or in part to
the NRC staff,'' said Frank Ingram of the commission.
   In informing the company of the fine, the NRC said, ``All levels
of plant management at that time either knew or should have known
of these facts.''
   The federal agency ordered the York County, Pa., plant closed in
1987, citing a pattern of control room operators dozing on the job.
Since then, PECO has shuffled its management and tried repeatedly
to get the commission to approve restart plans.
   PECO operates two units at Peach Bottom. The utility also
operates the Limerick nuclear plant in Montgomery County, near
Philadelphia.
   ``The proposed NRC actions are strong medicine for the
Philadelphia Electric Co. and a very clear message to the entire
nuclear industry,'' PECO spokesman William Jones said. ``... We are
relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and that
we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the Peach
Bottom restart plan.''
   PECO officials have said they plan to restart the plant, with
the NRC's approval, by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   Security police today said they raided
the home of a Palestinian, and a newspaper said the man
masterminded the terrorist attack on a Greek cruise ship last month.
   Police spokesman Ingvar Eriksson said investigators found four
Kalashnykov assault rifles among a cache of weapons hidden in a
forest a few miles from the home of Samir Mohammed Khaidir. He
would not say when the raid took place.
   The newspaper Aftonbladet said police conducted the raid in late
July and they believe Khaidir was the operations chief of the Abu
Nidal terrorist group and masterminded the July 11 assault on the
cruise ship ``City of Poros.''
   Ericksson declined to discuss Khaidir's role but said he was
believed to be one of nine people killed in the attack. More than
90 people were wounded in the assault on the ship in the
Mediterranean. The Abu Nidal group issued a statement after the
attack saying its members were not responsible.
   He said Khaidir, who was born in Lebanon in 1948 and described
himself as an international businessman, lived in a Stockholm
suburb since 1986 under the name of his Finnish-born wife. The name
is barred from publication under Swedish press laws, Eriksson said.
   Aftonbladet said police raided his apartment after an airline
ticket to Scandinavia was found in a Greek hotel room.
   Khaidir left Stockholm at the beginning of June and flew via
Copenhagen, Denmark, to Athens, under the name Hejab Aballa, the
paper said.
   Eriksson refused to discuss evidence found in the apartment and
said police were still investigating the seized documents.
   The newspaper said some documents linked Khaidir to the
hijacking of a Pan Am airliner to Karachi in 1986 and other
operations claimed by Abu Nidal. Sixteen people were killed in a
rescue operation by Pakistani authorities.

   A man died of head injuries today after
falling 15 feet from a whirling amusement park ride, police said.
   Witnesses reported that the man appeared to be clowning around
and was not secured by the safety bar Wednesday night, said Bill
Ramsey, a Peony Park spokesman.
   Byron James Conant, 31, of Missouri Valley, Iowa, died at
Methodist Hospital after the fall from the Hurricane, which has six
two-seat cars extended on arms that rotate and move up and down
about a center shaft.
   Police Sgt. Mike Cavanaugh said Conant was in the front seat of
a car with a friend in the back. He said the operator noticed
Conant in an unsafe position about 20 seconds into the ride but was
unable to stop the ride before the man fell.
   Witnesses told officers Conant appeared to be kneeling outside a
safety bar or turning around to talk to his friend, Cavanaugh said.
He said the bar appeared to be operating properly, but he ordered
the ride closed for further investigation.
   Ramsey said the park has operated the Hurricane for several
years without accident. The last serious accident at the park
occurred about 12 years ago when a person died on a ride that later
was removed, he said.

<HEAD>Voters in One California County Consider Ban on Steel-Jaw Traps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associted Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEVADA CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fur is flying in Nevada County
over a November ballot proposal to ban the use of steel-jaw leg
traps, the first time that voters in California will have a say on
the issue.
   Those favoring the ban say the traps, whichg and are indiscriminate,
posing a
hazard to humans, their pets and non-target animals.
   Advocates, including ranchers and government predator control
experts, say the traps are vital in their struggle to protect
livestock, crops and property. The traps also help control
outbreaks of rabies and other animal-carried diseases, they say.
   Sixty-six countries have banned the traps, and their use is
restricted in four states. Other California communities have
outlawed them, although the November initiative in the rural,
mountainous county northeast of Sacramento is the first time voters
in any of California's 58 counties will decide the issue.
   San Francisco has had a ban since 1977, and two years ago the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Santa Cruz
waged a successful campaign to get the Board of Supervisors to
outlaw steel-jaw traps in the county. Santa Clara County
supervisors passed a similar ordinance in April.
   Steel-jaw leg traps are triggered when pressure is applied to a
pad, snapping the U-shaped, spring-operated, toothless jaws closed.
The traps are available in a range of sizes for different animals.
The most powerful bear traps were outlawed in California years ago
because ``they used to find too many hunters trapped in them,''
said Art Johnston, chairman of Citizens for a Healthful and Safe
Environment, or CHASE, which favors the ban.
   Debate has been charged, with proponents of the ban trying to
make their case using photographs of maimed pets, mangled animals
and three-legged survivors who chewed off a paw in their desperate
escapes. Those who say the traps are necessary complain they are
helpless to counter the emotional appeals.
   ``The thing actually has taken on all of the intensity of a
religious controversy, with people rabidly for it and people
rabidly against it,'' Johnston, who joined the fray seven months
ago, said recently.
   ``We're not saying you can't trap anymore or you can't control
predators. We're just saying use a trap that if a kid gets caught
in it, they can get out. That's all we're saying.''
   David Lester, a federal trapper who contracts with Nevada County
to do predator control by request on about 30,000 acres, says his
job is misunderstood.
   ``There's responsible people on both sides, and then there's
radicals on both sides. ... It's frustrating,'' said Lester, who
was born and raised in the county and whose uncle was the county
trapper before him. ``I've read in the paper where I've been called
a moron for setting these traps. I feel I'm as much a part of
nature as that blade of grass or the coyote.''
   The county traps _ a maximum of 50 at any time _ are set off
trails to protect people, he said. Commercial fur trapping is done
during the winter when fewer people are outside, he said.
   Trappers are required by law to check their traps daily, but
enforcement is non-existent and many animals die of starvation or
exposure, critics say.
   ``It just has no place in a civilized society, especially
because there are so many alternatives,'' said Judy Cassada,
director of education for the Santa Cruz chapter of the SPCA.
   Instead of the steel traps, ranchers should use fencing,
shepherding and guard dogs, the ban's proponents say.
   Ron Tapp is one of the initiative's supporters. He couldn't walk
for two weeks after he stepped in a coyote-sized trap while
backpacking along the Feather River, he said.
   The real problem, those who favor the initiative say, is that
authorities see a successful crackdown on the use of steel-jaw
traps as a major erosion of their powers that could trigger further
victories by animal rights' activists who oppose wildlife
management and recreational hunting, trapping and fishing.
   ``They don't want to be regulated ... because they never have
been regulated,'' says Tanja Keogh, a co-coordinator of CHASE.
``It's the old Wild West mentality. ... They're afraid if we win,
the next step is we'll be taking away their guns.''

   Roger Jones may be taking commercials a bit
too seriously.
   Jones ordered a hamburger at the drive-through window at a
Wendy's restaurant Wednesday. Like the man in the Wendy's
commercial, he wasn't driving a car.
   Wendy's would not serve him and had to call the police when he
refused to get out of the way of other, behind-the-wheel customers.
He was not arrested.
   Jones said he saw the TV ad and was hoping to get the special
sale price good only at the window. ``There's nothing there that
says you have to be in a car,'' he said. ``It just seemed
ridiculous I couldn't get the burgers on sale.''
   In the commercial, a pedestrian picks up an order at the
drive-through window. Told that he's not in a car, he responds,
``That's what they told me at the car wash.''
   The ad and special sale price are part of a promotion to
increase sales at the window, said Frank Gallardo, Wendy's district
manager. He said company policy is to serve only people in a
vehicle because the traffic makes the lane dangerous for
pedestrians.
   Although similar incidents have occurred, Gallardo said, this
was the first time police had to be called.
   ``The strange thing is, he had a vehicle he could have used,''
Gallardo said.

<HEAD>PACs Boost Contributions To Congressional Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political action committees have boosted their
contributions to House and Senate candidates, Democrats and
incumbents in the 1987-88 election cycle, but they're giving less
to Republicans.
   Statistics released Thursday by the Federal Election Commission
said Democratic candidates experienced the most dramatic jump in
PAC donations, collecting $52 million from Jan. 1, 1987 to June 30,
1988. That's 44.4 percent better than they did last time around.
   Republicans, by contrast, collected $28 million from PACs _ a
6.7 percent drop. Since Democrats wrested control of the Senate in
1986, the GOP has been in the minority in both chambers.
   Incumbents received $66 million from PACs, a 29.4 percent
increase over the last election cycle. Challengers remained steady
with PAC donations of $7 million. Candidates for open seats
received $6 million, a 25 percent drop from two years ago.
   House candidates experienced a 29.3 percent rise in PAC
contributions, up to $53 million. And PACs were not the only rising
financial indicator for House candidates, according to the FEC
analysis.
   Spending by House candidates rose 11 percent this year to $111
million and fund-raising was up nearly 12 percent, to $154 million,
the agency said. Greater numbers of House incumbents are seeking
re-election, accounting for part of the across-the-board jump.
   On the Senate side, spending and fund-raising dropped _ at least
partly due to the differences between 1986 and 1988 candidates and
races. Spending fell 23.9 percent to $70 million, while
fund-raising declined 6.5 percent to $116 million, the FEC said.
   PAC contributions to Senate candidates continued to rise,
however, from $24 million two years ago to $27 million during the
current cycle.
   Overall, money raised by House and Senate candidates so far in
this cycle came to $270 million, up 3 percent from two years ago.
Spending by candidates for the two chambers stood at $181 million,
a 5.7 percent decline.
   The FEC said the number of candidates participating in federal
elections continued to decline, a trend that started in 1984. The
decline this year is confined to Democrats, the agency said,
particularly challengers and open seat campaigns.

   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. today agreed to
drop his call for the Republican platform to include a tougher
anti-apartheid stand, thereby making a convention floor fight
unlikely on any minority plank.
   His move came as the Republican Platform Committee moved toward
completion of the draft document that will be presented to the
party's national convention next Tuesday.
   Steve Snider, a Weicker spokesman, said the senator agreed to
withdraw his platform amendment seeking tough sanctions against
apartheid after getting support from Bush campaign officials for
another amendment calling for merger of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, co-chairman of the platform committee,
said today at a news conference that with Republicans closing ranks
around their draft platform, it is unlikely any minority amendments
will be offered at next week's Republican National Convention.
   Co-chairman Robert Kasten, a senator from Wisconsin, said
earlier on NBC-TV, ``We've built upon a constructive, conservative
platform we had in 1984 and then expanded it. We're going to deal
with drugs, we're going to deal with AIDS, we're going to deal with
education in a more detailed way than in 1984.''
   On Wednesday, the 106-member committee resisted moderates'
efforts to expand an AIDS plank and to tone down the draft's stern
stance against abortion, but they endorsed the concept of
catastrophic health coverage for sick children.
   ``The party is coming together. ... We don't have to have
minority planks because the platform process itself has worked so
well,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, another co-chairman.
   Orr and other committee leaders acknowledged that the
catastrophic care plank was vague _ like the Democrats' platform
they criticize relentlessly.
   ``Lordy, lordy, there are so many loopholes'' in the
catastrophic plank, said Marilyn Thayer of New Orleans. It does not
promise a new government program, she said, adding, ``Under the
Republican party we don't just look toward government to spend
people's hard-earned tax dollars to do this.''
   The committee voted 55-32 after a heated debate on abortion to
keep intact a declaration that ``the unborn child has a fundamental
individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''
   ```Cannot be infringed' says to me that men and fetuses have a
right to life at all times, but women lost that right when they
become pregnant,'' said Marjorie Bell Chambers of Los Alamos, N.M.,
who tried to strike the last four words.
   They rejected by voice vote an amendment to allow Medicaid
funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest, despite a plea
from Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut to recognize that ``rape is
awful.''
   ``Murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime,''
replied anti-abortion delegate Pat Elf of Kihei, Hawaii.
   They approved 53-30 a Weicker plank saying the GOP will ``work
toward making catasrophic coverage available to our youngest
citizens.''
   Weicker assured fellow delegates there was ``no financial
commitment involved ... but rather a commitment of spirit by this
party.''
   Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer from Irvine,
Calif., warned that the Republicans who have pilloried the
Democratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the same
path. The GOP platform pledges not to raise taxes, but ``we all
know (catastrophic coverage) is going to be expensive,'' she said.
   They refused by voice vote to expand their plank on the deadly
AIDS disease to endorse the recommendations of the president's
commission, especially its main one calling for anti-discrimination
legislation. Vice President George Bush has endorsed the entire
Watkins commission report, but President Reagan has not.
   ``The time has come to clearly put us on record for what needs
to be done,'' said Weicker. ``Never before have we asked anybody
who was hurting how they got hurt.''
   James Summers, an apartment builder from Bellevue, Wash., said
AIDS was ``the first legalized communicable disease in the history
of the United States.''
   Summers said ``the strength of the homosexual lobby'' had
prevented the country from taking stronger action to contain the
epidemic.
   The draft platform, which will be presented to the Republican
National Convention on Tuesday, calls for a vigorous fight against
AIDS, ``compassion and help'' for victims and steps to ``protect
those who do not have the disease.''
   The committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate a
pro-Equal Rights Amendment sought by Delaware's Lynn Glaze.
   The draft platform holds fast to the party's 1980 and 1984
pledges not to raise taxes and to seek a constitutional amendment
outlawing abortion, and calls for ``rapid and certain deployment''
of the Strategic Defense Initiative.

   Angola has apologized for the attack
by one of its warplanes on a private jet carrying Botswana's
president, a Cabinet minister said Thursday.
   Ponatshego Kedikilwe, minister for presidential affairs, said
Angola sent a note to Botswana saying the plane carrying President
Quett Masire had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft.
   One of two jet engines on Masire's 10-seater plane was shot off
Sunday as it flew 38,000 feet over Angola on the way from Gaborone
to a meeting in the Angolan capital, Luanda. The pilot made an
emergency landing at the town of Kuito in central Bie province.
   Masire and one of his aides were slightly injured when fragments
from the right engine penetrated the cabin.
   Kedikilwe, who was aboard the plane, said cordial relations
between Angola and Botswana would not be affected by the incident.
   Angola said the plane was flying in a corridor that has been
closed because of the war being waged by Angola and its Cuban
allies against South African- and U.S.-backed rebels.

<TEXT>
   A Senate national parks subcommittee announced
today a hearing on what has become known as the ``Third Battle of
Manassas,'' the fight by preservationists to prevent construction
of a shopping mall adjacent to a Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests will meet Sept. 8 to consider
legislation which the House passed 307-98 on Wednesday to buy the
542-acre mall site next to the battlefield where the Confederacy
won two major battles in 1861 and 1862.
   Historians and preservationists say a shopping mall would
desecrate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died on the
battlefield. The House bill would add the land to the existing
battlefield park.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said that after testimony is taken
at the hearing, he may offer legislation to buy only a part of the
developer's tract.
   ``My concern continues to be that the federal government could
spend a significant amount of the taxpayers' money for a parcel of
land, which during the debates in 1980, was not regarded as
historically significant for the Park expansion bill,'' said Warner.
   ``If Congress prevents development on this site and purchases
the property, at considerable expense to the federal taxpayer and
the mall is moved to a nearby site and built, is that expenditure
of federal funds justified in order to protect property which has
some historical significance?'' he asked.
   Warner said he believes the tract's Stuart's Hill where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had headquaters during the Second
Battle of Manassas in 1862 should be considered for inclusion in
the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   The Reagan administration opposes the measure because of its
cost _ estimated to range from $15 million to $100 million. Office
of Management and Budget and Interior Department officials have
said they would recommend that President Reagan veto the measure if
Congress enacts it in its current form.
   One of the major floor debates was the cost versus the
preservation of American heritage.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said important pieces of property
representing America's heritage must be preserved.
   ``Our country and our culture are built upon our heritage,'' he
said. ``Our past is an important part of our present, and our
future.''
   However, when the matter came to a vote, Parris voted
``present'' because the developer, John T. Hazel, has been a close
friend and campaign contributor to him for many years.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., called the measure ``a squandering
of the taxpayers' money. This should have a low priority or no
priority.''
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., also opposed the measure, saying:
``This is an extraordinary expenditure when we deny the needy.''
   But Rep. Bruce V. Vento, D-Minn., floor manager for the bill,
said, ``This is about history, about our cultural history that must
be preserved.
   ``It's a matter of whether we preserve our history or turn it
into a dollar,'' he said.
   Hazel purchased the land two years ago for under $10 million. It
is now assessed at $13.6 million. He wants to build 1.2 million
square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes next to the site of the two major Civil War
battles.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
Second Battle of Manassas, which lasted over three days in August
1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory in the war.

   China will begin a tour next month that will
follow the life of Pu Yi, the tragic figure who was the subject of
Bernardo Bertolucci's award-winning film ``The Last Emperor,'' it
was reported Thursday.
   The tour will take foreigners to his birthplace and childhood
home in the Forbidden City, the house in Tianjin where he lived in
exile and the prison in Changchun, northeast China, where he was
held after 1949 Communist takeover, according to the official
Xinhua news agency.
   Lu Bin, deputy head of the Beijing Tourism Administration, said
banquets will be served in Qing Dynasty settings with imperial
music and dances.
   Pu Yi's belongings, paintings, calligraphy and the manuscript of
his autobiography, ``From Emperor to Citizen'' will be on display
along the route, it said.
   The report did not say how much the tour would cost.
   Pu Yi, born in 1906, was emperor from 1908 to the overthrow of
the 267-year Qing Dynasty in 1911. He continued to live in the
Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, until 1924. In 1932 he became
emperor of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in northeast
China.
   He was imprisoned by the Soviets and then the Chinese after
World War II, and was finally released in 1959 to work as a
gardener. He died in 1967.
   Bertolucci's film won nine Academy Awards this year and has been
shown in more than 20 countries. The Chinese premiere of the movie
is scheduled for September after a delay reportedly resulting from
official unhappiness over the way the movie treats some events.

   Shock waves reverberating through world
financial markets in recent days reflect fears that the Federal
Reserve may have set off spiraling interest-rate increases that
will circulate around the globe.
   ``Until there is a clear-cut signal that the economies of the
world are growing at a slower pace, the bias is going to be toward
higher (interest) rates,'' says David Resler, chief economist at
Nomura Securities International Inc. But he doesn't expect an
all-out rate war.
   In the long term, higher interest rates can work to stabilize
stock and bond prices by calming inflation worries. But in the
immediate aftermath of the Fed's increase in its key lending rate
Tuesday, many traders remained skittish.
   As expected, U.S. banks reacted to the Fed's rate increase today
by raising their prime lending rate a half a percentage point to 10
percent, its highest level in more than three years.
   It was the third time this year that banks have raised the
prime, which is used to set a range of fixed and adjustable-rate
corporate and consumer loans.
   On Wednesday in Tokyo, the already volatile Nikkei Index of 225
selected issues plummeted 615.49 points _ 2.2 percent of its value.
It closed at 27,554.87, its biggest one-day loss since November, in
the wake of October's Black Monday.
   But the Tokyo exchange bounced back today, with the Nikkei
gaining 230.11 points, or 0.83 percent, to close at 27,784.98 as
the dollar declined sharply against the yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 22.7 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,839.90 on Wednesday. In
trading today, the index had fallen 10.2 points, or 0.6 percent, to
1,829.7 at midday.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
44.99 points Wednesday to close at 2,034.14 after losing more than
28 points the previous day. Government bond prices dropped while
their yields soared to rates not seen since December.
   At midday today, the Dow was off about 3 points at the 2,031
level, but analysts said prices were becoming low enough to attract
some bargain-hunters.
   The markets began reeling Tuesday after the Fed unexpectedly
announced a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate.
That put the fee the Fed charges member banks for short-term loans
at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two years.
   Some said markets overseas were caught by surprise and
overreacted. Many investors around the world had assumed the Fed
would refrain from taking any interest-rate action until after
November's presidential election.
   But with the Fed's decisive, anti-inflation move, ``there's
worry on a worldwide basis that everybody is competing, with
interest rates as their weapon,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice
president at First Albany Corp.
   Many of the nation's major trading partners have taken action
recently to push up short-term interest rates, albeit for different
reasons. West Germany is concerned that its currency has been
losing value, while Britain is working to hold down inflation.
   Rate hikes, for whatever reason, ``make markets fairly nervous
even though cooperation among the major Western trading nations
hasn't broken down,'' Johnson said. ``There's nervousness that it
could break down.''
   Interest rate coordination typically is uncertain. ``It's an
uneasy alliance,'' said Ronald Solberg, a vice president and senior
international economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles.
   ``The coordinated moves over the last two years were more the
result of individual vested interest rather than a gracious
contribution toward coordination,'' he said.
   If interest rates become a drawing card for U.S. securities,
some of the money siphoned out of Japan's stock market could find
its way into American markets.
   ``There's no doubt that Japanese portfolio managers have an
ongoing appetite for U.S.-dollar assets, and this increased rate
differential makes them attractive,'' Solberg said.
   The Japanese government's long-term bond is yielding about 5.4
percent, compared with a yield of more than 9.3 percent Wednesday
on the U.S. Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue.
   Central banks are unlikely to increase interest rates solely to
prevent money from flowing into U.S. markets.
   Nomura's Resler said interest rates are rising ``not because
monetary authorities are trying to attract capital, but because the
prospects are for faster inflation, a condition that favors higher
rates.''

   Police said Thursday that 67
white men, including a minister and prominent businessmen, are
suspects in child sex rings that operated in Johannesburg and Cape
Town.
   All the suspects are being investigated in connection with
sexual abuse of white boys, said Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the
Law and Order Ministry. He said some have been arrested and others
were being sought.
   He said the investigation started in June.
   Mellet said the suspects, 38 in Johannesburg and 29 in Cape
Town, also included a school principal and an engineer.
   One man, who police allege had kept a 17-year-old youth a
virtual prisoner at his home, committed suicide after police
questioning, Mellet said.
   Mellet said the case involved rings that allegedly traded boys,
and police concentrated on cases involving child prostitution,
indecent assault, sexual activity with minors and sodomy.

   The military commander today warned
that Burma faces anarchy, and official media said 15 more people
were killed and 81 wounded as anti-government violence spread to
Rangoon's suburbs.
   ``The people are now facing anarchy of the violence-makers,''
said the commander, Sau Maung, in a Radio Rangoon broadcast.
   The state-owned radio said demonstrators were preparing
firebombs and planning to ``escalate'' violent activities. The
radio said the 15 people were killed and 81 wounded in Rangoon
today. That brings the official death count from violence
throughout the country since Tuesday to about 95.
   Government offices, police stations and railway stations also
were destroyed and rice warehouses looted, it said. But the
broadcast said only one large demonstration was held in the Rangoon
area today when 1,000 people rallied in the suburb of North
Okkalapa.
   The radio said three aircraft dropped leaflets when 10,000
people surrounded a military unit in Okkalapa on Wednesday. The
radio said troops would have to open fire if the crowds did not
disperse.
   Diplomats in Rangoon, the capital, said soldiers and several
thousand anti-government demonstrators continued the demonstration
in the suburb today.
   Diplomats said cited unconfirmed reports indicated that at least
two truckloads of troops sided with the residents of North Okkalapa
and that residents erected barricades in the area.
   Reliable reports said people fought fiercely with troops in the
area Wednesday and that residents used weapons that were either
captured or turned over to them by military defectors. The
warplanes reportedly dropped the leaflets that day.
   Burma's official Radio Rangoon said rioters beheaded two
policemen Wednesday in North Okkalapa and that two other people
were killed. It said a third policemen was beheaded in nearby South
Okkalapa.
   The protests against the authoritarian rule of new President
Sein Lwin are the worst since Burma's democracy was overthrown 26
years ago.
   Burmese leaders were believed to have met in an all-night
emergency session to discuss ways to cope with the nationwide
turmoil, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported today.
   The agency said Buddhist leaders today appealed for calm in a
statement printed on top of the front page of the state-run
English-language newspaper The Guardian.
   Travelers returning from Rangoon say the city of 3.5 million was
barely functioning, with most shops and markets closed, few
government workers reporting to offices and public transportation
almost at a standstill. The city's vital river port had stopped
operating, and some diplomats said they were running short of food.
   The demonstrations are by far the largest since a coup by Ne Win
ended democracy in Burma in 1962. Sein Lwin became president and
head of the government party last month when Ne Win resigned.
   Protesters accuse Sein Lwin of ruthlessly suppressing student
riots in March and June, when he was an army general, and earlier
harsh measures against dissenters.
   The government appears to be sealing itself off from the outside
world and has stopped issuing tourist visas at most of its missions
abroad. The government has tried to keep foreign journalists out
since trouble began after the transfer of power.
   In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday that the U.S.
Embassy was closed temporarily, but some ``essential personnel''
reported for work today. The British, Japanese and French
governments have warned their nationals to avoid traveling to Burma
for the time being.
   Official American personnel and their dependents, 154 people,
are safe at their homes, said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley.
   Five lawmakers introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate
condemning the shooting of unarmed demonstrators. It asks that
one-party rule end and urges President Reagan to raise the issue of
human rights abuses with Burmese authorities.
   Chants and placards by demonstrators have called for restoration
of democracy, the overthrow of Sein Lwin and the release of
Brigadier Aung Gyi and other prisoners.
   Aung Gyi, the system's most strident critic, and at least a
dozen other prominent figures were arrested late last month. They
included Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand today joined several
professional and human rights organizations calling for Sein Win's
release.

   Greece has signed a $4.1 million barter
deal for 50 Soviet-built trolley buses to update its aging
electric-powered fleet, the Transport Ministry said Thursday.
   According to an agreement signed Wednesday with the Soviet firm
Massinov Export, the first 15 trolleys will be delivered in January
1989 and the remaining 35 by June, a ministry announcement said.
   Each trolley costs $83,050 but most will be paid for in exports
of Greek oranges and other farm products, said a spokesman for
ILPAP, the state-owned Athens trolley bus company.
   The new trolleys will replace some of the 154 Italian-made
trolley buses circulating in Athens since the 1950s.
   The remainder of the 400-trolley fleet consists of Soviet-made
vehicles bought in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Socialist President Rodrigo Borja, sworn
in for a four-year term, accused his archconservative predecessor
of dragging Ecuador into economic disaster and promised an
emergency plan to end the crisis.
   Borja, 53, received the yellow, blue and red presidential sash
from Wilfrido Lucero, president of the National Legislature, during
Wednesday night's inauguration.
   The outgoing president, Leon Febres Cordero, refused to
personally hand over the sash to Borja. In 1984, Borja lost a
bitter runoff to Febres Cordero, who was the Reagan
administration's closest ally in South America.
   Attending the ceremony were seven foreign leaders, including
Cuba's Fidel Castro. The United States was represented by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz, who was booed by some people in the
crowd.
   Borja today met President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, who could
not come to the inauguration because the outgoing president refused
to let him into the country. Febres Cordero broke diplomatic ties
with Nicaragua in 1985, and Ortega and Borja planned to restore
relations later today.
   Borja, head of Ecuador's Democratic Left Party, has promised a
non-aligned policy and said that one of his first official acts
will be to restore ties with Nicaragua.
   ``We have received a country in moral and economic bankrupcy,''
Borja said during his 2{-hour inaugural speech. The leftist law
professor said the free-market economic system Febres Cordero
encouraged has fueled inflation and impoverished the nation of 10
million.
   ``You don't have to be an economist to know that,'' Borja said.
``It is enough to go to the market, walk along the country roads or
visit shantytowns to feel the daily drama of poor people.''
   He promised an emergency plan to solve the problem, but gave no
details.
   Borja won the presidency in May, defeating populist candidate
Abdala Bucaram. Febres Cordero, who served one term, was not
eligible for re-election.
   In a farewell speech earlier, Febres Cordero defended his
government's efforts to deal with what he called Ecuador's worst
economic crisis. He noted that oil prices, which provide 60 percent
of the nation's hard currency earnings, had recently plunged to $13
a barrel from $27 a barrel in 1984.
   In addition, he said, the economy was severely affected by
earthquakes that crippled the oil industry for six months last year.
   Ecuador's economy, burdened by a $9.2 billion debt, shrank by
3.5 percent in 1987. Less than half the work force has full-time
jobs and inflation is running at an annual rate of 55 percent.
   In an apparent reference to the new president's stated plans to
drop the free-market economy, Shultz told reporters after meeting
with Borja: ``I think that one of the things that is crystal clear
in the world today is that method of running an economy by central
control, as advocated by the left, simply doesn't work.''
   ``The most recent sample right here in this neighborhood is the
example of Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Borja said Ecuador cannot pay its foreign debt under the present
conditions: ``In the friendliest possible manner, I ask from our
creditors a more understanding attitude, as the basis for a lasting
understanding.''
   Ecuador is more than $1 billion in arrears in the service of its
debt.
   Also attending the inauguration were presidents Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica, Jaime Lusinchi of Venezuela, Virgilio Barco of
Colombia, Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay
and Mario Soares of Portugal.

   This tiny republic is issuing four postage
stamps dedicated to the fight against AIDS, the government said
Thursday.
   The stamps, due to come out in the next few days, were prepared
in conjunction with an international congress on AIDS in San Marino
in October.
   ``The set carries a warning but at the same time hope,'' a
government statement said.
   The stamps cost about 18 cents to 71 cents each.
   San Marino, an enclave in Italy's Apennine mountains, claims to
be the world's oldest republic, founded in 301. Tourism and its
postage stamps and coins are its chief sources of income.

<HEAD>Armenian Activist's Requests To Return Rebuffed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expelled Armenian activist's requests to return
to the Soviet Union are not being taken seriously by the
government, a legal official said Thursday.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and
expelled from the country to Soviet-allied Ethiopia on July 21.
   The 39-year-old Armenian activist was arrested in March for his
part in spreading word to Western journalists about the Armenian
people's campaign to have a region of neighboring Azerbaijan
annexed to their republic.
   Pavel A. Laptiev, an aide with the Soviet State
Prosecutor-General's office, appeared at a Foreign Ministry
briefing to discuss the handling of Ayrikyan's case.
   Laptiev contended Ayrikyan had asked during his imprisonment to
be allowed to emigrate to the United States.
   Ayrikyan, however, told reporters in Paris last week that after
his arrest, Soviet authorities gave him the choice of returning to
prison or going to the United States. He said he was expelled
because Soviet officials feared putting him on trial would lead to
more inter-ethnic hostility.
   The U.S. government declined to issue Ayrikyan an immigration
visa on the grounds that he was leaving the Soviet Union against
his will.
   In news conferences in Paris, Rome and Bonn, West Germany,
Ayrikyan has said he would like to return to Armenia. He said he
has applied to the Soviet Embassy in Paris for permission to do so.
   Soviet officials indicate the appeal will be rejected.
   ``His requests to be reinstated cannot be taken seriously,''
Laptiev told reporters.
   Laptiev disputed Western news reports that suggested Ayrikyan
was summarily expelled against his wishes, but conceded the
activist was stripped of Soviet citizenship in the same action that
dropped charges against him.
   Soviet law does not allow emigration if a criminal case is
pending against the applicant, Laptiev said. To clear that
obstacle, preliminary charges that allowed Ayrikyan to be jailed
for more than four months this year were dropped by an order of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
   Ethnic rioting killed at least 32 people in Azerbaijan after
Armenians launched a campaign in February to annex a part of
Azerbaijan to Armenia.

   A gunman fatally shot a 32-year-old woman in
the head as she waited in a car with her 8-year-old daughter for a
traffic light to change, and police said they had no motive for the
slaying.
   Dorothea Hutchinson, a cosmetology student, was shot Tuesday in
an unincorporated area south of downtown, sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox
said. The gunman fled before authorities arrived.
   The girl was not harmed.
   The car rolled into a fence after the shooting, and Ms.
Hutchinson's daughter Kristen jumped out of the car and ran to a
home for help, said Hertesene McDowell, Ms. Hutchinson's mother.
   ``She asked the people to call paramedics, and she then called
me,'' Ms. McDowell said. ``When I arrived, she asked me: `Granny,
did I do the right thing? My mother always told me to do that if
anything ever happened to her.'''
   Ms. Hutchinson was rushed to Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical
Center where she died early Wednesday, said Walter Gray, assistant
hospital administrator.
   Police said they had not determined a motive and no suspects
were in custody early Thursday.

   A former Agency for International Development
employee pleaded guilty today to embezzling $1.2 million from the
government and agreed to forfeit the proceeds of a lavish lifestyle
resulting from his crime.
   William J. Burns, 48, pleaded guilty to embezzlement, filing
false claims and attempted tax evasion before U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who scheduled sentencing for Oct. 11.
   The judge reminded Burns that he could receive up to 20 years
imprisonment and be fined up to $500,000 upon the convictions.
   But under sentencing guidelines implemented last year that take
into account a defendant's past criminal history, Burns would
receive a prison term ranging from 2 1@2 to three years and a
month, according to Justice Department prosecutor James Cole.
   Both sides may withdraw from the plea agreement if the sentence
calculated by the probation department is different from the range
estimated by the prosecution and defense.
   Burns, who was a $35,108-a-year financial manager, admitted that
since 1982 he submitted false claim forms to arrange for the
issuance of travel reimbursement checks to a Vincent Kauffman.
   As a financial officer, Burns could sign the forms to authorize
issuance of the checks.
   The checks were sent to a Washington bank account that Burns set
up under Kauffman's name. Cole told Johnson that all of the
deposits into the account were Treasury checks. Burns withdrew
money by forging checks to himself and signing Kauffman's signature
or using an automatic teller card to get cash.
   The money was used to purchase ``a house, car, furs, trips,
jewels and other personal luxury items for Mr. Burns and his
family,'' Cole said.
   Burns admitted filing two false claim forms in June for more
than $56,000. Burns also pleaded guilty to a charge that he failed
to report any of the money he embezzled as income to avoid paying
taxes on $475,685.
   According to the plea agreement, Burns agreed to surrender his
$300,000 house in Burtonsville, Md., and all the possessions and
property he bought with the money.
   Burns's wife, Kathy, will be allowed to keep a car and $10,000
and necessary household goods ``to get a start in life with her two
children,'' Cole told the judge.
   Burns and his attorney, David Addis, left the U.S. Courthouse
without commenting on the case.
   During the proceeding, Addis said his client ``has demonstrated
his desire to make a bad situation better.''
   Urging Johnson to allow Burns to remain free on $500,000 bond,
Addis argued Burns won't jump bail. ``He has a family, he has two
children, he knows he has injured them terribly. He is not going to
do anything to compound that.''
   The judge allowed Burns to remain free on bond pending
sentencing.
   As part of the plea agreement, Burns and his wife agreed to give
government investigators a full accounting of their assets. Burns
agreed to make up the difference between the money the government
collects from selling his property and the amount he stole from the
government.
   He also faces civil tax penalties, Cole said.
   Burns also agreed to cooperate with a continuing investigation,
Cole said. Investigators determined that there was an unspecified
amount of additional money taken in a related embezzlement scheme,
Cole said.

   The Earth shook a little less in the first
half of this year.
   The U.S. Geological Survey reported Thursday that there were 26
significant earthquakes in the first six months of the year, three
fewer than in the same period a year ago.
   And only 12 deaths have been attirbuted to quakes around the
world in the first half of the year.
   If that rate continued, an annual total of 24 deaths would be
the lowest ever recorded, the survey said. The current low record
is 77 deaths in 1984. The high was 600,000 in 1976.
   One of this year's deaths was in the United States, a heart
attack victim in California on Feb. 11.
   Of the 26 significant quakes this year only two affected the
United States. One was the Feb. 11 event that qualified as
significant because of the death, although it measured only 4.8 on
the Richter scale of ground motion.
   To be considered significant a quake must cause casualties or
measure at least 6.5 on the scale.
   The second U.S. quake qualified easily, scoring a 7.6. It
occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska, skaking parts of Alaska and
Canada and generating a small tsunami, or sea wave.
   That was, in fact, the strongest quake so far this year. The
world has now gone more than 60 months without a ``great'' temblor,
measuring 8.0 or more.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the force of a quake as
determined by ground motion. An increase of one whole number, from
6.6 to 7.6 for example, represents a tenfold increase in the
strength of the quake.

   Ernest St. John ``Jack'' Metz, an opera
coach and vocal adviser to the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, has
died of liver cancer. He was 66.
   Metz died Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center.
   During the last decade, from May to July each year, Metz also
acted as vocal adviser to the Australian Opera in Sydney.
   He spent most of the last 20 years as mentor and companion to
Metropolitan Opera soprano Leona Mitchell. He also has worked with
singers Leontyne Price, Kathryn Grayson, Maralin Niska, Mary Costa,
Carol Neblett, Ken Remo, Jonathan Mack, Neil Shicoff, Carol Vaness
and Angelique Burzynski.
   Born in Charleston, S.C., Metz studied piano and voice as a
child. He moved to Hollywood in the late 1940s and opened a studio.
He has since coached hundreds of young singers.
   A memorial service was scheduled Friday in North Hollywood.

   Actor Willem Dafoe agrees his portrayal of
Jesus in Martin Scorsese's new film ``The Last Temptation'' is not
typical biblical movie fare.
   ``This is a deeply religious movie for Marty,'' said Dafoe.
``It's not a debunking; it's not a riff. It's a way to articulate
his deep feelings.
   ``Sure, part of the idea was to humanize Christ. It's short on
heavenly angels. But, in the end, it's triumphant in the way people
who subscribe to the Jesus story want it to be,'' Dafoe said in an
interview published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times.
   The film, which opens nationwide Friday, has drawn denunciations
from conservative Christian groups. Based on a novel by Nikos
Kazantzakis, the movie includes such scenes as Jesus dreaming of
making love to Mary Magdalene.

   Rock musician Gene Simmons of the heavy metal
band Kiss says he is too busy getting the group ready for the road
to play a villain in the new James Bond movie ``License Revoked.''
   Simmons, a founding member of the glitter-rock band once known
for its alter-ego makeup, begged out of a job offer from film
producer Cubby Broccoli. The bass player cited concert commitments
to the European version of the International Monsters of Rock Tour,
said publicist David Brokaw.
   The Bond film, featuring Timothy Dalton in his second appearance
as the elusive agent 007, begins shooting in Mexico in September,
Brokaw said.
   Simmons enthralled Kiss fans worldwide in the 1970s with onstage
antics that included breathing fire and spitting fake blood. For
years band members refused to show their faces in public or be
photographed without their trademark black-and-white makeup.
   Still known for its raunchy musical style and irreverent lyrics,
Kiss will play its first club date in 15 years in New York on

   For the third straight

to visit ``the Spains'' _ as they call the Spanish royal family.
   Prince Charles, Diana, and sons William, 6, and Harry, 4,
arrived Thursday on a Royal Air Force jet, said an airport official
who did not want to be identified.
   The British royalty were greeted at the airport by Crown Prince
Felipe, heir to the Spanish throne, who drove them to meet King
Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at their Marivent Palace summer
residence on this Mediterranean island, the official said.
   Spanish press reports said the holiday was originally to last 10
days but may be shortened so Charles and Diana can attend the
christening of their yet-unnamed niece born Aug. 8 to the duke and
duchess of York.
   Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is scheduled in October to
become the first British head of state to visit Spain. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher plans a September visit.

   July's hot weather cost Americans more than a
quarter-billion dollars more than normal in keeping cool, the
government reported Thursday.
   The national air conditioning bill for July was $4.3 billion,
some $255 million more than would have been expected in normal
weather, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
reported.
   That averaged out to a July air conditioning bill of $104 for
the typical home, $6 more than normal.
   Costs varied with the weather from region to region, with only
the west south central states spending less on cooling than in a
typical July.
   Here is a regional rundown of the estimated cost, per household,
of air conditioning in July.
   _West South Central, $131, $4 less than normal. Includes
Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.

reached out for minority votes Republicans have not attracted in
recent years.
   The pace of preparations for the Republican National Convention
in New Orleans picked up as platform writers hoped to finish the
GOP document by the end of the day.
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., today agreed to drop his
call for the platform to include a tougher stand against apartheid.
And Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, co-chairman of the platform committee,
said that with Republicans closing ranks around the draft document,
it is unlikely any minority amendments will be offered at next
week's convention.
   Dukakis kicked off a five-state campaign trip with a speech on
leadership at New York University.
   Without mentioning Bush by name, the Masssachusetts governor
sought to portray himself as a chief executive who would not
tolerate waste in the Pentagon and would ``clean up the mess'' in
military procurement.
   ``We've got to have a real leader in the White House who will
insist that, when it comes to our national security, we're going to
make our decisions based not on what's good for one company or one
military service or one political party but on what's good for
America,'' Dukakis said.
   ``The test of a successful defense policy isn't how much money
we spend; it's how much security we buy,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee said. ``And for the past eight years, we
haven't gotten what we've gone into debt for...We have to build
strong military forces based on sound planning and tough
management, not wishful thinking and blank checks.''
   Bush spent more time in Washington today working on his
acceptance speech, to be delivered a week from tonight. He and his
family had lunch with President and Nancy Reagan at the White House
for a rare gathering of both couples. The White House announced
today that the Reagans and Bushes would also cross paths Tuesday in
New Orleans, as Reagan leaves the convention city after his
farewell and Bush arrives for his coronation.
   Later today, the vice president scheduled an announcement
designed to demonstrate that Democrats cannot take black votes for
granted. He was to announce a group known as the National Black
Americans for Bush. Campaign aides said it would include about 100
blacks, including officeholders and prominent black Republicans.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis helped to break ground for a new sewage
plant to help clean up Boston Harbor, a $6 billion undertaking that
is also the largest public works undertaking in Massachusetts
history.
   In response to Republicans who had pummeled him for deciding in
his first term as governor to delay efforts to end the pollution
problems there, Dukakis said: ``Nobody could really tell us what to
do to clean up this place. There were very respected people,
experts in the field, who disagreed.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater nonetheless added another slam
on Wednesday, saying: ``If it takes the governor of Massachusetts
11 years to clean up his own harbor, Americans must question his
commitment to the even larger environmental questions which face
our nation.''
   Bush jumped to the defense of his boss on Wednesday, saying
Reagan has not altered his stance on the issues or made personnel
decisions to help Bush in the fall campaign.
   ``Almost everything the president does, he gets asked a
question, `Are you doing this to help George Bush?' or `Are you
doing this because of '88?' and I guess it's just that time of
year,'' Bush said in Washington.
   Reagan recently picked two people close to Bush for Cabinet jobs
_ investment banker Nicholas Brady for Treasury and former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh for attorney general. And he
named a Hispanic to head the Education Department just weeks after
Bush promised to put a Hispanic in his Cabinet.
   Bush also lobbied Reagan to allow a plant-closing notification
bill to become law and to veto a $299.5 billion defense
authorization bill.
   Also in New Orleans, the full 106-member Platform Committee
ground through the 30,000-word draft document, sticking to a
conservative approach but declaring the party is open to minorities
and women.
   The draft echoes the 1984 document, including a pledge not to
raise taxes, support for Constitutional amendments to ban abortion
and balance the federal budget, and backing for ``rapid and certain
deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   The party, in trouble with many female voters, added ``women''
to the plank on economic opportunity, making the phrasing ``the GOP
is the natural champion of blacks, minorities, women and ethnic
Americans.''
   But the RNC swiftly rejected an appeal from a group calling
itself Freedom Republicans to include more minorities on party
bodies.
   ``It seems to me that the Republican Party looks at us like
Limburger cheese _ a little bit of us goes a long way,'' said
Lugenia Gordon, a 67-year-old black woman from New York City.

   An examination of space shuttle
Discovery a day after its test firing turned up no problems to
stand in the way of getting the shuttle ready for flight, NASA said
Thursday.
   ``This vehicle is the cleanest we've ever had after a
flight-readiness firing,'' said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for
NASA's Kennedy Space Center. ``We haven't turned up anything
unusual.''
   The successful firing of the three huge engines was a spirit
lifter for space workers here who have had to overcome one problem
after another since Discovery was transported to the launch pad
July 4.
   Miss Malone said officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will not set a launch date until a repair unrelated
to the hot-fire test of the engines is completed.
   That repair, which involves cutting a hole in the Discovery's
bulkhead to gain access to pipe connection that is leaking gas, is
scheduled to begin Wednesday and will take about six days. The leak
is in the system used to steer Discovery in space.
   NASA has one other milestone to meet before setting a date for
the first flight since Challenger exploded in January 1986. That is
a test, scheduled for Aug. 18, of a shuttle booster rocket at the
manufacturing plant in Utah. The test is the fifth in a series of
the booster, which was heavily redesigned after Challenger.
   A faulty joint in Challenger's right booster allowed flames to
escape and triggered the destruction of the shuttle. The joint and
other booster systems have been thoroughly redesigned.
   The rocket will be deliberately flawed, with grooves, cuts and
debondings introduced in critical areas like insulation and O-ring
seals.
   ``It is a significant flaw demonstration test,'' said Robert
Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations. ``Some say there is
a risk in it, but we have to test the booster to withstand these
worst-case situations.''

<HEAD>Annual Crayfish Season Opens, with Some American Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedes opened their annual crayfish
season Thursday with much singing and slurping, but the national
holiday had to be helped with imports from China and Louisiana.
   Sweden's crayfish stocks were decimated by a bacterial plague
beginning in the 1960s. Since then this country of 8.4 million
people has become one of the world's biggest importers of the
shellfish, with about 1,800 tons a year.
   The price of the scarce Swedish crayfish hit about $61 for two
pounds, but American imports were readily available at $15 bargains.
   U.S. imports of 1,000 tons this year ended Turkey's previous
dominanation of the market.
   Technically, Thursday is the opening of the fishing season for
the freshwater crustaceans. But traditionally, no one eats even the
imported varieties until Aug. 11.
   The crayfish are boiled in dill and smothered in tradition.
Swedes eat them wearing party hats and bibs. Time-honored rules say
each claw should be downed with a glass of schnapps.
   With an influx of imports from new countries, Swedish newspapers
held gourmet tests to evaluate this year's crop. Judges were
Swedish celebrities, actors or famous chefs.
   Svenska Dagbladet proclaimed an American West Coast variety
named ``California Sunshine'' as the best. ``Fresh and tasty'' with
``beautiful coloring,'' the paper judged. The Chinese jumbo Prino
``looked great but tasted disgusting,'' it said.

   Major U.S. banks raised their prime rate a half
percentage point to 10 percent today, two days after the Federal
Reserve boosted its own key lending rate to stave off inflation.
   The increase brings the closely watched prime rate to its
highest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5
percent from 10 percent.
   Chase Manhattan Bank started today's move, with Citibank,
Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, First
National Bank of Chicago and Continental Illinois National Bank and
Morgan Guaranty quickly matching the rise.
   Major banks on the West Coast, such as Wells Fargo Bank and
Security Pacific National Bank, also followed suit.
   Stock and bond prices were mixed and the dollar moved slightly
higher after the announcment.
   It was the third time this year that banks have raised the
prime, which is used in setting a range of fixed- and
adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.
   ``With interest rates moving higher you're going to see
increases in fixed- and adjustable rate mortgages (and) floating
lines of credit,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``If you want to go out and get a car loan or an unsecured line
of credit to buy furniture that's going to cost you more.''
   Economists had expected the move after the Fed signaled its
desire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 6.5
percent from 6 percent on Tuesday, largely as a means of holding
down inflationary pressures.
   The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to
member banks.
   Interest rates have been rising steadily in recent months in
reaction to the strength of the economy.
   Mrs. Reiners said banks decided to raise the prime after the
federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
suged above 8 percent.
   ``Usually there's a pretty good correlation between the spread
of fed funds and the prime rate,'' she said.

   Adolph Hitler Clark, a 17-year-old who
said he wanted to turn his life around after years of problems
because of his name, is wanted in a fatal shooting over crack
cocaine.
   Police said Thursday that Clark, a high school dropout, is named
in a warrant for the Aug. 2 shooting death of Terry Lamar Combs, 35.
   Combs was shot after he drove up to several men who offered to
sell him crack, police said. Detective Frank Japour said Combs was
shot with an ``Uzi-type weapon'' after trying to haggle with one of
the dealers.
   Witnesses identified Clark as the man who fired the gun, Japour
said. He was being sought Thursday, police said.
   In an interview with The Florida Times-Union last year, Clark
said he had developed a poor self-image because of his name and
thought that crime was expected of him.
   He was named Adolph after an uncle and his father followed that
by Hitler, saying later that he thought it ``would be good for a
middle name,'' Clark said.
   The first name of the German dictator was spelled Adolf.
   Clark said he was teased for years by other children and finally
became involved in a series of crimes.
   By age 16, Clark had been in and out of police custody for eight
years in juvenile cases and was brought into court to face trial as
an adult on an auto theft charge.
   In a letter to a judge last year, Clark said he was led into
crime by poorly chosen friends and promised to reform.
   ``I know I can live a righteous life. I just need a chance to
prove it,'' he wrote from the Montgomery Correctional Center.
   But instead, Japour said, Clark has ``graduated through the
ranks. Now, he stands accused of murder.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists at a conference organized by the
environmental group Greenpeace urged northern European countries
Thursday to stop polluting the North and Baltic seas until they can
solve the mysterious deaths of thousands of seals.
   Scientists said it was unclear whether pollution was playing a
role in the deaths, and they called for international research.
   Greenpeace said it will take direct, non-violent action in all
countries bordering the North and Baltic seas, including blocking
pipelines that discharge toxic chemicals.
   ``The time for words is gone,'' said Andy Booth, Greenpeace
International's North Sea coordinator.
   ``Time is running out for these oceans,'' he said at a news
conference following the meeting of scientists from Britain,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, West Germany and the Netherlands.
   Booth said Greenpeace will send the meeting's conclusions to the
leaders of all governments bordering the North and Baltic seas and
will urge them to introduce urgent measures to ease pollution.
   ``Greenpeace will be peacefully trying to prevent the flow of
certain peristent man-made chemicals which we regard as too
dangerous to be discharged into the marine environment,'' he added.
Greenpeace did not reveal when or where it would try to block
pipelines.
   Conference chairman Minnie Courtney said about 7,000 harbor
seals, have died in the North and Baltic Seas since April, out of a
population of 15,000 to 16,000 seals.
   In some areas up to half the harbor seals have died and there
are indications other seal species may become infected, she said.
   Two viruses have been isolated among the dead seals, said Ms.
Courtney, senior lecturer in biology at the University of London's
Queen Mary College, which co-sponsored the conference.
   She added, however, that ``we don't understand why the disease
should have spread so quickly through the seals and we don't
understand why they are reacting to it so badly.''
   ``There is no doubt that the Baltic and the North seas are very
polluted areas. They're some of the most polluted marine waters in
the world.''
   Every year an estimateed 260,000 tons of liquid industrial
waste, 77 million tons of dredged materials and 5 million tons of
sewage sludge are discharged into the North Sea.
   An international research project ``to study the effect of
environmental factors, including pollutants, on the immune system
of seals should be started immediately,'' Ms. Courtney said.
   ``In the interim, every effort should be made to reduce the
leakage of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) into the environment
... Immediate, effective, precautionary measures should be taken to
stop the discharge of other persistent pollutants.''
   The viruses leave the seals suffering from a variety of
symptoms, including lethargy, diarrhea, skin lesions and
spontaneous abortions. Autopsies show inflamed brains and other
organs.
   The scienists said there have been similar cases of mass seal
deaths in non-polluted waters.
   Sheila Anderson of Britain's Sea Mammal Research Unit said 400
harbor seals died off the New England coast in 1979-80, and 2,000
crab-eater seals died in the Antarctic in 1955. In both cases, the
cause of death was thought to be viral pneumonia.
   But Ms. Courtney said there is evidence from other animals that
PCBs, dioxins and other toxic chemicals in the North and Baltic
seas can interefere with immune systems.
   ``The seas are contaminated with a very complex mixture of toxic
chemicals, some of which are discharged in millions of tons
annually,'' she said. ``The individual action and the ....
interactions of these are poorly understood and cannot be excluded
as an additional factor in the seal deaths.''

<HEAD>Trade in Endangered Species Up in Holiday Season, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal traders make about $1.5 billion a year
from crocodiles, parrots, chimpanzees and other endangered
wildlife, and many of the animals suffocate or starve during
shipment, a wildlife enforcement official said Thursday.
   Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer
and Christmas holiday seasons because customs officials often are
overloaded and the shipments slip past them, Jean-Patrick Le Duc
told a news conference.
   Le Duc is an enforcement official for the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
which aims to prevent international trade from threatening species
with extinction.
   The convention, in force since 1975, has been ratified by 95
countries, including the United States, most Latin American
countries except Mexico, and many Asian, African and European
nations.
   Signatories are supposed to enforce bans on commercial trade in
an agreed list of endangered species and to regulate trade in
others that might become endangered.
   Endangered species on the list include all apes, the giant
panda, many South American monkeys, the Asian elephant, all
rhinoceroses, many birds of prey and parrots, all sea turtles, some
crocodiles and great whales. No permits are issued for
international trade in these species except under unusual
circumstances.
   Le Duc said many people think live animals make good Christmas
presents. In Europe, for example, parrots and reptiles including
baby crocodiles are increasingly popular pets.
   He said total trade, legal and illegal, in wildlife amounts to
$5 billion annually. He estimated that illegal trade is about 30
percent of the total.
   The hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are Southeast Asia,
Japan, Latin America and Africa, although ``Africa is doing more
than any other developing country'' to try to control it, Le Duc
said.
   But he said a trader could buy a gray parrot in Ghana for about
$10 and resell it for about $600 in North America.
   A statement from the convention's headquarters in Lausanne
listed 10 examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in the
past 10 weeks.
   In one case, ``a notorious convicted animal trader'' sent crates
with live animals from Equatorial Guinea destined for Honduras via
Spain, it said.
   ``At Madrid airport, customs agents stopped the shipment. In the
crates they found five chimpanzees (two dead), 12 crocodiles (three
dead) nine Mandrill monkeys (one dead), 11 Agama lizards (nine
dead), seven tortoises, 17 Saimiri monkeys (two dead) and 31 gray
parrots,'' the statement said. ``The surviving animals were given
to the Madrid Zoo.''
   In two other cases, 8,000 baby crocodiles were shipped from
Colombia to Taiwan, it said. One shipment of 2,000 was discovered
because of the stench of about 1,500 that had died.
   The statement said a female Asian elephant recently arrived in
the Dutch port of Rotterdam from Vietnam ``hidden in a large
crate.'' Her skin had dried up during the one-month journey and she
was ``in a pitiful state,'' it said. The elephant survived and is
at the Rotterdam Zoo.

<HEAD>Wallop Says He's Not Worried By Any Democratic Resurgence in the
West</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 16th graf, `If Dukakis ...,' to CORRECT that Wallop

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop says he's not
worried a Democratic resurgence in the West being forecast by some
pollsters will sweep him from office in November.
   Wyoming voters, he says, have too much to lose by a presidential
victory by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to turn to the
Democrats. Besides, he adds, he's done a good job in his two terms
in the Senate.
   The three Democrats vying in Tuesday's primary for the chance to
run against Wallop, however, point to findings indicating their
party is the strongest it's been in the West since 1964. And they
say Wallop has ignored Wyoming concerns and is out of step even
with his own party _ for instance, his vote against ratification of
the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty.
   In a report last week, Andrew Kohut, head of The Gallup
Organization, said polls conducted for the Times Mirror Co. show
that the traditionally conservative outlook of westerners appears
to have changed.
   ``Traditionally anti-government voters in the Rocky Mountains
are now calling for more government action on social issues than is
the average American voter.''
   And, he said, Western voters are dissatisfied with the general
course of the nation and have not found in Vice President George
Bush the anti-establishment leader they once saw in Ronald Reagan.
   This is good news for the three Democratic hopefuls.
   ``Reagan is personally popular in parts of Wyoming, but his
policies and the results of those policies are not and people are
ready for a change,'' said state Sen. John Vinich, a 14-year
veteran of the Legislature who announced for Wallop's seat last
fall. ``People are looking to the Democratic Party for that change,
and of course, Wyoming presently has a full congressional
delegation of the minority party back there.''
   The state's other senator, Alan Simpson, has been mentioned as a
possible running mate for George Bush. Wyoming's lone congressman
is Dick Cheney.
   In the primary, Vinich faces Lynn Simons, in her third term as
state schools superintendent, and Pete Maxfield, a University of
Wyoming professor trying to repeat the success of Democrat Gale
McGee, another professor who served 18 years in the Senate.
   Maxfield, who like McGee 30 years ago is making his first
venture into politics, also believes the Reagan administration has
lost its Teflon coating.
   ``I have family members who voted for Reagan, but would not vote
for Bush because of their concerns about the deficit and the
increase in the (national) debt,'' said Maxfield, a tax law expert.
   Simons, however, is not as certain that the presidential race
will have a strong impact on the Senate contest.
   ``I think that it would be an advantage to have a strong
Democratic ticket from the top down in Wyoming,'' she said. ``I
also believe that Wyoming voters are very independent voters, and
there may or may not be a `coattails' effect.''
   Wallop, through it all, is sticking to his conservative guns.
   If Dukakis is going to win the West in November, he'll have to
change his views, said the senator, who faces only minimal
opposition for his party's Senate nomination.
   ``Dukakis stands for nothing but increased federal control,
decreased multiple use (of wildlands) and an increase in the
withdrawal of state's rights to control their resources,'' Wallop
said. ``These are all critical Wyoming issues.''
   Taking issue with the Democrats' claims that he ignored state
concerns while focusing on national and international affairs, he
said: ``My experience is of no use if my performance with that
experience hasn't been good. I say it has been good for jobs,
agriculture, education, the recreation industry and taxpayers. It
has been good for the state.''

<HEAD>Iraq Accuses Iran Of Shelling Basra Area</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Iraq accusing Iran of shelling
Basra area. TRIMS thereafter to tighten. No pickup.
^By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today accused Iran of shelling Iraqi
military positions near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the
Persian Gulf war broke out nearly eight years ago.
   The attacks, if confirmed, would be the first serious fighting
reported since both nations agreed Monday at the United Nations to
begin a cease-fire Aug. 20 and to open direct talks in Geneva five
days later.
   The accusation came in a brief statement from the Iraqi Mission
to the United Nations. It said the attacks occurred Wednesday and
today.
   The statement said ``the Iranian armed forces bombarded Iraqi
military positions'' around Basra and the Faw peninsula with
howitzers, mortars and small missiles. The brief report to the
United Nations did not denounce Iran.
   The statement also did not say whether Iraq suffered casualties.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who had no
immediate comment on the statement, scheduled a meeting with Iraqi
Ambassador Ismat Kittani at the ambassador's request, presumably to
discuss the situation.
   When Perez de Cuellar announced the cease-fire date, Iran gave
him a letter pledging it would not launch any attacks prior Aug. 20.
   Iraq did not submit a similar letter, but the U.N. chief said
Tuesday he had received oral assurances from both nations they
would exercise restraint.
   The main attack on Basra involved 214 howitzer shells, 205
mortar rounds and 32 small missiles, the Iraqi statement said. The
Faw bombardment involved 26 howitzer shells, 32 mortar rounds and
16 small missiles, it added.
   Both targets are near Shatt al-Arab, the disputed waterway that
forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. It is the only sea
outlet Iraq has and it has been blocked by Iran since early in the
war. Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 after border skirmishes in a bid to
gain complete control of the waterway.
   Today's Iraqi statement also said without elaborating that an
Iranian tank fired two missiles at Iraqi positions in the
``northern sector'' of the border.
   On Wednesday, Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati, complained to Parez de Cuellar that Iraqi warplanes had
buzzed Iranian cities and warned that more such flights could
jeopardize the proposed truce.
   In Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's acting commander-in-chief,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, said a U.N. inquiry must condemn Iraq as the
aggressor in the war or the region will face grave consequences.
   After meeting with the U.N. chief, Mahallati told reporters that
Iraqi overflights ``can be a dangerous opening. If it (the
overflights) would be continued, I am afraid that it is an obstacle

   Perez de Cuellar said of the alleged overflights:
   ``I am persuaded that if something happened, it was kind of a
mistake, a technical mistake, a misunderstanding.''

<HEAD>High Interest Rates Expected To Slow Retail Sales Advances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the
third consecutive monthly increase, but economists say rising
interest rates threaten to dampen even this modest growth rate in
the months ahead.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales increased $632
million last month to a seasonally adjusted $134.0 billion. The
rise followed increases of 0.4 percent in June and 0.8 percent in
May.
   ``Retail sales were on the soft side in July,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Where there were
increases, they were just moderate. However, coming after so strong
a second quarter ... some pause in growth should not be suprising.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
called the report ``good news'' and said the statistics ``indicate
a steadily growing economy.''
   Sinai and other economists said sales should continue to
increase through the third quarter because of strong job growth,
but they warned that consumer spending will soften eventually as
interest rates creep higher.
   Several of the nation's largest banks raised their prime lending
rate a half percentage point to 10 percent on Thursday, just two
days after the Federal Reserve boosted its key lending rate.
   It was the third increase this year in the prime rate, on which
many consumer loan rates are based, and pushed it to its highest
level in three years.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said the
growing popularity of adjustable rate home mortgages and home
equity loans, most of them fluctuating with the prime rate, means
more households are pinched by rising rates than in the past.
   ``A large group of people are about to experience a squeeze on
their cash flow and as we move into the last part of the year that
should effect consumer spending,'' Steinberg said.
   Sales last month were led by a 1.9 percent jump at automotive
dealers to $30.1 billion, the biggest climb since February, when
auto sales shot up 2.0 percent. Automotive sales had climbed a
modest 0.4 percent in June.
   Excluding autos, sales were up a scant 0.1 percent in July.
   The strongest category other than autos was clothing stores,
where sales jumped 1.6 percent after a 0.6 percent rise in June.
   However, David Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua,
N.Y., noted that the government does not adjust retail sales
figures for inflation. He said strength in autos and clothing at
least partly reflected higher prices.
   The number of autos sold, as reported separately by the Commerce
Department, was the same last month as in June. Levy said auto
dealers, who generally have had strong sales this year, are not
discounting as heavily as in past years. Thus, after seasonal
adjustments, sales figures rose.
   Levy said apparel sales also look stronger than they normally
would because of price increases earlier this year. However, he
attributed some of the strength to consumers postponing purchases
of summer clothing from May, when the weather was unseasonably
cool, to June and July.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores, helped
by hot weather-related buying, were up a slight 0.2 percent to
$15.2 billion in July after a strong 1.4 percent increase a month
earlier.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, were up 0.7 percent, solely on the strength of
autos. Hardware and building supply stores reported a 1.8 percent
drop in sales last month, while sales at furniture stores were off
1.0 percent.
   Sales of non-durable goods, led by specialty clothing stores,
were up 0.4 percent.
   There were gains of 0.6 percent at food and grocery stores,
caused mostly by price increases rather than an increase in sales
volume, and 0.2 percent at restaurants and bars.
   Drug stores reported a 1.0 percent drop in July sales, while
gasoline stations reported a 0.2 percent decline.
   Overall sales for the first seven months of the year were 6.5
percent greater than the same period in 1987, about two percentage
points above the rate of inflation.

   South Korea's second civil airline
company said Thursday it has changed its name to Asiana Airlines
from Seoul Air International.
   Company officials said the change was to avoid confusion with an
African airline that uses the same initials SAI.
   Asiana Airlines, a subsidiary of the Kumho group, one of the
largest conglomerates in South Korea, plans to begin domestic
flights late this year and international flights to Japan in 1990.
   Korean Air is the largest carrier in South Korea.

   Two congressmen unveiled legislation Thursday
that would establish an independent public advisory panel to
investigate alleged unethical practices by House members.
   Reps. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., and Barney Frank, D-Mass., also
proposed creating the office of an independent inspector general to
audit financial matters of the House and its members.
   ``What we're trying to deal with here is the perception that
congressmen are not fulfilling their public trust,'' DioGuardi said
at a news conference.
   ``This is not an issue of individuals, this is not an issue of
parties or politics,'' he added. ``This is basically an issue of
process.''
   Both congressmen stressed the conflicts inherent in the current
system under which House members police themselves through the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. That committee,
composed of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, enforces
the code of conduct and recommends to the full House sanctions
against members who violate it.
   ``Is it fair to expect congressmen and congresswomen to change
their role from one of collegiality to judge and jury?'' DioGuardi
said.
   The two congressmen introduced a resolution Thursday to create a
panel of six people, three chosen by the House speaker and three by
the minority leader, to investigate alleged wrongdoings.
   No member could be a current or past congressman; a relative of
a congressman, officer or employee of any government; or a lobbyist
or registered foreign agent.
   The board would have full investigative powers, including the
ability to issue subpoenas. It would report its findings to the
ethics committee, which would be required to pass them on to the
full House unchanged.
   The ethics committee would have to continue to exist because
under the Constitution, only Congress can discipline itself.
   The inspector general would randomly and periodically audit the
House's financial operations, including payroll and official
expenses, the congressmen said. He or she would report any waste,
fraud or abuse to the public review board for action.

   Twenty days of uninterrupted rain have put 40
percent of the oil wells in China's largest oil producing area
under water, authorities said Thursday.
   The Daqing Oilfield in northeast China has been submerged under
up to 32 inches of water, according to the Central Flood
Headquarters.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the flooding has
reduced petroleum output by 952,000 barrels.
   Last year, Daqing pumped 388.85 million barrels of oil, 50
percent of China's total, Xinhua said.
   It also said 9,000 homes in the area have been flooded, and
1,200 are on the verge of collapse.
   Rainstorms, typhoons and floods have killed nearly 1,000 people
in areas of southern, coastal and northeastern China since the
spring.

<HEAD>Doctors Stage Day-long Strike Over Pay, Patient Backlog</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7,000 doctors walked off the job at
Israel's state-run hospitals Thursday to protest a stalemate in
talks on pay and a government plan to deal with a backlog of
patients who need operations.
   The day-long strike prompted some health officials to demand
reform of Israel's public health system, which has been crippled in
recent years by job actions by nurses and emergency medical workers
as well as the physicians.
   Israel's state-run medical system provides free service to all
members of health plans. All doctors in state-run hospitals
participated in the strike. Israel has 9,000 physicians.
   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim condemned the striking doctors and
said the government had ``reached the limit'' on what it could give.
   ``I think there also must be a limit to how much doctors can
torture their patients,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Rubi Steinberg, a spokesman for the doctors' union, said
physicians were demanding pay increases of up to 30 percent and an
improvement in a proposed government program to give hospitals
enough funds to operate on 15,000 patients in the next nine months.
   The doctors want the program to last longer and encompass about
45,000 patients they estimate are awaiting major operations as well
as an estimated 60,000 people on the waiting list for minor surgery
and treatment.
   Currently, Steinberg said, a doctor with a 10-year tenure earns
$1,000 to $1,100 a month, not counting night and emergency stand-by
duties, and a beginner's basic salary may be as low as $500 a month.
   ``We're protesting against the stalemate in negotiations. Every
proposal we raise is rejected,'' he said.
   Some health officials said Israel's medical system urgently
needs to be reformed. They cited frequent strikes by hospital
maintenance staff, nurses, emergency medical service workers and
the doctors.
   In 1983, doctors walked off their jobs for most of four months,
staged a hunger strike to protest working conditions and
established temporary private clinics.
   ``The system has not functioned for years and continues to
deteriorate,'' Steinberg said. ``Doctors have not gotten proper
salaries. Many have decided to change their profession or
emigrate.''
   Prof. Charles Greenblatt of the Hebrew University's medical
school blamed ``poor morale, the lack of a financial basis, and
continuous confrontations that are not settled by negotiations.''
   ``There's something wrong with the whole system,'' he said. ``It
is not patient-oriented.''
   Greenblatt suggested reforming the system by establishing
smaller regional hospitals and ending free medical care.

   An unemployed beer salesman who tried to
snare a fishing contest's $105,000 prize by placing lead weights in
a bass instead tipped the scales of justice against him.
   David Scott Lynd, 25, received two years' probation Wednesday in
an attempted felony theft charge that was filed when lead weights
were discovered in his prize catch during the KYKX Big Bass Classic
fishing tournament at Lake 'O The Pines in May.
   State District Judge Bill Porter said the sentence was the
lightest that could be assessed for the heavy fish. Texas law
provides a maximum of two to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to
$5,000 for attempted felony theft.
   Lynd denied placing the weights in his bass and also denied
buying them at a Garland store, although game wardens found an
itemized cash register receipt detailing the purchase in Lynd's
fishing boat after he was arrested.
   Lynd's attorney, Jerry Biesel, told jurors Lynd would not have
placed the weights in the fish because he knew tournament judges
would cut it open for inspection.
   ``He is no rocket scientist,'' Biesel told jurors, ``but he
isn't crazy.''
   Lynd, of Garland, showed no emotion after the verdict and
sentence were handed down. He later referred all questions to
Biesel.
   Biesel also declined comment, but Marion County Attorney Marion
Hileman said after the two-day trial he was disappointed with the
sentence.
   Mike Gatons, KYKX vice president and general manager, said he
was ``very satisfied with the jury verdict'' and that it showed the
radio station, which hosts the bass tournament at Lake 'O The Pines
each spring, is committed to holding a ``good and clean
tournament.''
   Lynd's fish weighed 7.64 pounds, leading the 6,000-plus field of
contestants before being disallowed by tournament officials. A
7.43-pounder then took the prize.

<TEXT>
   Sixty percent of American voters still consider
the Soviet Union ``a serious threat,'' but an even larger majority
trust the Soviets enough to sign a treaty eliminating most nuclear
weapons within 12 years, according to a poll released Thursday.
   A series of developments, including the Reagan-Gorbachev summits
and the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, are chipping away at
Americans' mistrust of the Soviet Union, pollster Daniel
Yankelovich said at a news conference.
   The poll was one of several commissioned for ``Americans Talk
Security,'' a series of surveys on national defense and security
issues funded by Boston businessman Alan F. Kay.
   In telephone interviews with 1,000 registered voters,
Yankelovich's firm found a majority trusted the Soviets enough to
believe that the United States and the Soviet Union could:
   _Sign a treaty to eliminate most nuclear weapons by the year
2000 (71 percent).
   _Work together to stop illicit drug trafficking (85 percent);
halt environmental pollution (85 percent); fight terrorism (78
percent); resolve conflicts in the Mideast and other trouble spots
(72 percent).
   _Expand cultural exchanges (84 percent).
   The survey, taken in July shortly after the Moscow summit, noted
a 7 percent increase in American voters' belief that relations with
the Soviets are improving. Yankelovich said that conviction jumped
from 61 percent in March to 68 percent four months later.
   But Yankelovich also noted a persistent strain of mistrust
toward the Soviets, with 60 percent describing the Soviet Union as
a major threat to the United States, down from 76 percent before
Gorbachev took office.
   Only 36 percent thought the United States should sell
non-military high technology to the Soviets; 34 percent would stop
work on Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as part of a nuclear
arms agreement; 28 percent favored sharing SDI technology with the
Soviets as it is developed.
   ``It may take 10 years or more for this mistrust to dissipate.
It won't go overnight,'' he said.
   Women without a college education were far more mistrustful of
the Soviets and Gorbachev than similarly educated men or
college-educated men and women, a finding which Democratic pollster
John Martilla said ``flies somewhat in the face of conventional
wisdom.''
   Although 37 percent of all voters said they trusted the Soviet
Union ``not at all,'' 43 percent of women took that stand, compared
to only 30 percent of men.
   When asked what the Soviets could do to increase trust, only two
actions were cited by a majority of voters: reducing the power of
the secret police (60 percent) and ceasing attempts to win over
U.S. allies (53 percent).
   The poll has a margin of error of 3 percent.

   The skipper of the USS Dubuque will be
relieved from command this weekend pending an investigation of
charges the warship failed to adequately assist a boatload of
Vietnamese refugees who later reportedly resorted to cannibalism to
survive, officials said Thursday.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, ``has been assigned temporarily
to the (Philippines-based) Commander, Naval Surface Group, Western
Pacific pending the results of a Navy inquiry into the sufficiency
of the assistance provided by the ship to a Vietnamese refugee boat
... on June 9,'' said Dan Howard, the chief Pentagon spokesman.
   Vice Adm. George Davis, commander of the Naval Surface Force,
U.S. Pacific Fleet, ordered the transfer, he said.
   The Navy said Balian would be relieved Saturday by Capt. David
Wetherell, who left San Diego, Calif., on Wednesday to fly to the
Persian Gulf. The Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, encountered
the Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea while en route to
the gulf.
   Howard and Navy officials stressed that the captain's
reassignment was considered administrative and not punitive at this
point.
   ``I think it would certainly be premature to judge this a
penalty,'' Howard said. ``The captain has been temporarily
reassigned while the investigation is being conducted, and the Navy
always has that prerogative.''
   The Navy and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees are
investigating reports of murder and cannibalism that surfaced
earlier this week in a Philippine newspaper. The Vietnamese boat
people eventually were rescued off the Philippines and are in a
refugee camp there.
   The newspaper quoted survivors as saying they killed and ate
some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they
encountered the Dubuque on June 9. Two of the victims reportedly
died of starvation, but three others allegedly were murdered
through drowning and then eaten.
   Some survivors charged the Dubuque refused to take them aboard
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure
and starvation. Instead, the ship gave them food and water and left
them because it was on a ``dangerous mission,'' the survivors
claimed.
   According to Robert Cooper, the Manila representative of the
U.N. refugee commission, 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea, but
58 people died during the crossing. The refugees began their
journey on May 22 from the Mekong Delta town of Ben Tre aboard a
35-foot wooden boat. Its engine failed two or three days later.
   Navy regulations specify that warships may pick up refugees on
the high seas if the vessel they're traveling in is judged
unseaworthy, bad weather is approaching or there are ``other
special circumstances.''
   ``In other words, it's a judgment call by the captain of the
vessel,'' Howard said.
   The Navy said earlier this week that when the Dubuque chanced
upon the refugees, their boat ``was judged to be in seaworthy
condition and was under sail.''
   ``The USS Dubuque gave the refugees food, water and navigational
charts before resuming transit to the Indian Ocean,'' the Navy said.
   Balian, a native of Los Angeles, won a Silver Star for heroism
during the Vietnam war while a young lieutenant. His Navy patrol
boat was sunk in 1966 in a Viet Cong night ambush on a river near
Vung Tau, southeast of Saigon. One crewman was killed and Balian
and other crewmen were wounded but managed to escape to safety
aboard a makeshift raft.

   The Justice Ministry said Thursday it
will release more than 20 political prisoners around Aug. 15
marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Korean peninsula
from Japan.
   Ministry officials said the political prisoners would be
released on parole along with 1,400 other non-political criminals.
   On June, the government of President Roh Tae-woo released 46
political prisoners on parole, including Kim Keun-tae, who received
the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights.
   Roh has released hundreds of political prisoners since June 29,
1987, when nationwide protests forced the government to accept
demands for democratic reforms.
   Opposition groups maintain there are more than 500 disidents
imprisoned for political beliefs or anti-govenment activity, with
many of them still on trial.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea after its liberation in 1945 from Japan's
36-year-old occupation.

<TEXT>
   Angola's ambassador to the United Nations on
Thursday rejected the idea of national reconcilation talks with
anti-Marxist rebels but said the guerrillas will be given jobs and
houses if they lay down their arms.
   Ambassador Manuel Pacavira told reporters that his government
did not consider the U.S.-backed rebels in the south of Angola a
legitimate force.
   ``In Angola there is no opposition, there is no civil war,''
Pacavira said. ``What exists in Angola is a military confrontation
with South Africa and its paramilitary forces ... UNITA.''
   The rebels, headed by Jonas Savimbi, calls themselves UNITA for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Earlier this week, Chester Crocker, the assistant secretary of
State for African affairs, said an unresolved civil war in Angola
``could hamper and postpone'' efforts to reach a troop withdrawal
agreement.
   Crocker mediated an agreement between Angola, South Africa and
Cuba under which Pretoria began withdrawing its troops from Angola
on Wednesday. The parties will next try to reach agreement on the
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from Angola.
   Negotiators, however, have not tried to resolve Angola's civil
war. The United States has supported the concept of national
reconcilation talks between the Luanda government and UNITA, which
controls large areas of land.
   But Pacavira said his government has proposed a program of
``national harmonization'' if UNITA fighters surrender. Individual
guerrillas would be integrated into society, he said.
   The offer does not extend to Savimbi, who has good relations
with the Reagan administration. ``I cannot comment on what will
happen to him,'' Pacavira said.
   He called Savimbi a ``terrorist'' and an opportunist who ``today
is with God and tomorrow is with the devil.''
   The ambassador also said the United States should stop its
support for Savimbi, though such as act would not necessarily mean
the Angolan government would stop accepting military aid from the
Soviet Union.
   ``U.S. assistance to UNITA cannot be conditioned in any form to
the Soviet assistance to Angola,'' he said
   On a related issue, Pacavira denied that the Soviet Union has
pressured Angola into signing a cease-fire.

   Bigfoot can relax for now; Grover Krantz
has been grounded.
   The Washington State University anthropology professor said
Wednesday that he doubts he'll be able to get his ultra-light
helicopter running in time to search for the fabled Sasquatch
before he has to return to the classroom.
   Last spring, Krantz announced plans to use the helicopter and
heat-seeking infrared devices to search for the hairy, man-like
beast in the Blue Mountains east of Walla Walla.
   But he's been unable to figure out how to get the throttle of
the helicopter he built from a kit to operate properly.
   Because the fall term is approaching and he has to get back to
the classroom, Krantz said it probably will be spring before the
search begins in earnest.
   Krantz conducts the search for Bigfoot on his own time and
without any financial support from the university.
   The expert on human evolution said he searches for evidence of
Bigfoot because he can neither prove nor disprove the existence of
the creature.

   A cat napping in the wheel well of a

45-mile flight.
   ``At least she was intelligent enough to wait until the engines

Hilton, president of Daytona Beach Regional Airport.
   The cat, Patricia, had napped in the plane's front wheel well

airfield near Orlando. But no one told the cat that a pilot planned
to fly the plane Wednesday.
   When it took off, the cat either hung on or jumped into a nook
as the plane reached 2,500 feet and a speed of more than 125 mph,
Miss Barksdale said. The Cessna 310 landed without incident.
   ``I can't say that we've ever had any hitchiking cats come

   ``Just think of the ride that thing had!'' said airport employee

   Czechoslovakia sentenced Maloth, 76, to death in absentia in
1948 for war crimes at the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and
it asked Italy on Tuesday to extradite him.
   Italian officials put Maloth on an airplane from Verona to
Munich on Wednesday, after his arrest last week at his wife's home
in the northern Italian town of Merano.
   Italy and Czechoslovakia have no extradition treaty, and Italian
law bars extraditing someone facing the death penalty. Italy does
not have capital punishment.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen said officials
determined Maloth is a West German citizen and cannot be extradited
under its constitution.
   Schacht, who is leading the inquiry into Maloth's past, said he
has no plans to bring criminal charges against the former
concentration camp guard. West German officials say Maloth is free
to move about as he pleases.
   At a news conference Thursday in Dortmund, Schacht said: ``He
wants to stay temporarily in Munich and apply for a West German
passport. Then he wants to return to Merano legally.''
   Asked whether Maloth could face interrogation after that, the
prosecutor said: ``The attending physician has already expressed
his doubts. At this point, he is not able to take care of himself.''
   The director of the national memorial in the town where the Nazi
camp was located told the Czechoslovak Communist Party daily
newspaper Rude Pravo that 2,400 documents provide evidence of
Maloth's crimes.
   The CTK news agency, which carried excerpts of the interview,
quoted Vaclav Novak as saying the crimes included ``grievous bodily
harms, killings and murders.''
   Maloth ``voluntarily and with pleasure asked to be a member of
execution squads,'' Novak told Rude Pravo.
   CTK quoted Novak as saying ``several dozen'' witnesses to
Maloth's crimes are still alive.
   Maloth was arrested at his wife's home in Merano in northern
Italy last week. Vienna-based Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said
Maloth had been hiding with his family in Italy for 15 years.

   The Senate voted 90-4 passage Thursday of its
second Pentagon budget bill, which includes an election-year
message to Japan and Western Europe to pay more for allied defense
and sets new restrictions on defense consultants.
   President Reagan last week vetoed the Democratic-controlled
Congress' first defense bill because he objected to its cuts in his
proposed Star Wars budget and restrictions on nuclear arms control
policy.
   The $282 billion defense budget bill was the last major item
keeping the Senate from starting a nearly four-week recess.
   When Congress returns after Labor Day, House and Senate
negotiators will meet to iron out differences between the defense
bills passed separately by each chamber. The House version approved
two months ago contains neither of the major provisions voted
Thursday.
   One difference will be the allied ``burden-sharing'' measure
endorsed Thursday on a voice vote by the Senate as part of the
defense spending bill. No similar measure was part of the companion
bill approved by the House two months ago.
   The Senate provision orders a major review of U.S. overseas
commitments, a limit on American troop deployments to Japan and
South Korea, and a ceiling on spending for U.S. military personnel
stationed overseas. The last provision requires the allies to pay
the difference if deployment costs of U.S. troops rise above 1988
levels.
   The Senate rejected, 59-36, another provision calling for a 10
percent cut in the total of American dependents living overseas
with servicemen.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, opposed the dependents' ceiling
because ``I can't think of anything more damaging to the morale of
our troops than to limit dependents.''
   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said, ``Enough is enough. We
have 413,000 dependents worldwide. That is far more than any other
nation in history.''
   Legislators of both parties have been increasingly vocal in
recent months in their calls for more help from America's allies,
particularly Japan and the European members of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We need help and we need to let our allies know that,'' said
Johnston.
   Later, the Senate gave voice vote approval to an amendment by
Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., providing strict new reporting
requirements for private consultants to the Pentagon and defense
contractors.
   Pryor's plan was prompted by the Pentagon bribery investigation,
which involves allegations that consultants were involving in
obtaining inside information from Defense Department employees
about details of planned contracts. No charges have yet been filed.
   The amendment requires consultants to register, much as
lobbyists for foreign nations must now do, and detail all their
clients and contracts.
   Noting the current investigation, Pryor asked, ``How bad do we
want this system to get before we finally pay some attention to it?
... We need some mechanism to find out who is working as a
consultant and how many sides of the street they're working.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, suggested that hearings should be
held by congressional committees before the requirement is
approved. But he agreed that ``certainly, there's an overwhelming
revulsion in the country against the bribery scandal in the Navy.''
   The measure considered by the Senate was an appropriation bill,
which contains money to pay for programs spelled out by separate
authorization legislation in the two-step congressional budget
process.
   The bill Reagan rejected was the authorization measure, which
proposed $299.5 billion for the Pentagon for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.
   The appropriation bill considered by the Senate generally
reflects the spending figures in the earlier bill, although those
totals may be changed by the House-Senate conference committee. As
a negotiating tactic, the Senate added an amendment to the
appropriation bill containing the entire text of the Senate version
of the authorization legislation.
   For example, Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The program
receives $3.9 billion this year.
   The bill the president vetoed provided $4.0 billion for Star
Wars, which he said was too little. The measure considered Thursday
was based on that $4.0 billion figure, but the Senate version of
the authorization bill provided $4.6 billion.
   In addition, the appropriations bill contains none of the arms
control restrictions Reagan opposes. Those had been added to the
earlier legislation by the House and the conference committee is
likely to consider the issue again.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; and William Proxmire,
D-Wis. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Thad Cochran,
R-Miss.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn.; and James Exon, D-Neb.

<HEAD>Borja Resumes Diplomatic Ties With Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja re-established
diplomatic ties with Nicaragua in his first full day in office
Thursday, but also said he wanted to have good relations with the
United States.
   ``Each country has a right to follow its own political path and
its own road to economic development,'' said Borja in a welcoming
statement for President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, who arrived in
Quito on Thursday.
   Borja, a moderate leftist, took office Wednesday night. He
replaced conservative Leon Febres Cordero, the Reagan's
administration closest ally in South America.
   Borja won election to a four-year term May 8, defeating populist
Abdala Bucaram. Febres Cordero, who was ineligible for re-election,
broke ties with Nicaragua in October 1985.
   Ortega was greeted at the airport by Borja, who said the
Sandinista leader's presence confirmed ``the political and
ideological pluralism that we practice.''
   Ortega condemned what he called ``the attitudes of imperialists
that try to subject the people of Latin America and the Caribbean.''
   Because of the rupture in diplomatic ties, Ortega was not able
to attend Borja's inauguration. President Fidel Castro of Cuba, in
his first trip to South America in 17 years, was among seven Latin
American and European presidents at the ceremony.
   Borja said at a news conference that the re-establishment of
relations with Nicaragua should not be interpreted as a hostile
move toward the United States.
   The United States has supported Nicaraguan rebels in their
7-year-old war to topple its leftist Sandinista government. On
Wednesday, the U.S. Senate approved another $27 million in
humanitarian aid for the rebels, known as Contras.
   Borja said he told Secretary of State George Shultz on Wednesday
that ``within a framework of mutual respect for non-intervention in
the internal affairs of our countries, our relations will be
cordial and friendly with the United States.''
   Borja noted that the United States is the market for 60 percent
of Ecuador's exports and thus relations with it are important.
   ``I think there can be good cooperation between our government
and the American government,'' he said.
   In an apparent reference to Borja's plans to impose controls on
Ecuador's free-market economy, Shultz had said directing an economy
``by central planning, as advocated by the left, simply doesn't
work.''
   Borja, a 53-year-old law professor, said in his inaugural speech
that Febres Cordero's free-market policies had favored the rich
over the poor, fueled inflation and impoverished the population.
   ``You don't have to be an economist to know that. It is enough
to to the market, walk along country roads or visit shantytowns to
feel the drama of poor people,'' he said.
   Borja also said he was ready to cooperate fully with the U.S.
government in the fight against international drug trafficking.
   ``But those efforts will not be sufficient in the consumer
countries do not control the purchase and consumption of drugs,''
he said.
   In the last two years, Ecuador has become an increasingly
important transit point for cocaine being smuggled from Colombia to
the United States and Europe.

   Alexander G. Balian, the U.S. Navy
captain facing allegations that his ship gave inadequate aid to a
Vietnamese refugees at sea, is a decorated hero of the war that
created the ``boat people.''
   Twenty-six years after actions that won him the Silver Star, the
nation's third-highest award for valor, he describes himself as a
trouble-shooter who specializes in ``putting ships back in shape.''
   Navy officials said Thursday in Washington that Balian, 48, was
being relieved temporarily as commander of the amphibious landing
ship USS Dubuque pending investigation of claims by some of 52
Vietnamese refugees that his ship refused to rescue them June 9 in
the South China Sea.
   The refugees were quoted as saying they later were forced to
kill and eat some of their companions to survive. They said the
boat's engine failed two or three days off Vietnam and 58 people
died during a 37-day ordeal, most of them after the encounter with
the Dubuque.
   The 16,500-ton warship, carrying 400 Marines and a crew of about
425, was en route to the Persian Gulf, four days out from its home
port at Sasebo, Japan.
   According to Navy officials, the Dubuque gave the refugees food,
water and navigational charts. Its personnel did not believe them
to be in serious trouble.
   The Navy said Balian was being transferred to another post in
the Western Pacific ``on an administrative basis'' until the
inquiry was finished, not being relieved ``for cause.''
   Balian was born in Southgate, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb,
where his family is in the grocery business. He has a degree in
business administration from UCLA and was commissioned from the
Navy's Officer Candidate School in 1963.
   In 1966, Balian was a 24-year-old lieutenant commanding a group
of Navy ``swift'' boats patrolling rivers southeast of Saigon. He
won the Silver Star for saving his crew after their boat was caught
in a Viet Cong ambush southeast of Saigon.
   His helmsman was killed and Balian and two other men were
wounded when the guerrillas attacked from concealed shore positions
with rocket grenades and small arms.
   As the boat sank, the survivors put the body on a makeshift raft
and floated downstream to safety, past other Viet Cong positions.
   Balian did a second Vietnam tour in 1968 on a destroyer, and was
assigned to the Persian Gulf in the early 1970s as communications
officer for the Navy's gulf-based Middle East Force.
   Since July 13, 1987, he has commanded the Dubuque, which is
designed to support amphibious landing operations but serves in the
gulf as a ``mother ship'' for mine sweepers. It carries 400 Marines
as a ready reaction force.
   Other previous assignments included command of the Navy
ammunition ships Kilauea and Kiska in 1979-82.
   Balian's wife and two daughters live in Sasebo.

   Home prices and sales during the April-June
period portray a booming economy on the West Coast, some cooling in
the once red-hot Northeast, resurgence in the Midwest and a hint of
a turnaround in the Southwest.
   The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that three
California metropolitan areas _ Anaheim-Santa Ana, Los Angeles and
San Francisco _ posted the highest home appreciation rates in the
country.
   A 20.1 percent rise in prices from the second quarter of 1987 to
the same period this year made the Anaheim-Santa Ana area the
costliest housing market in the nation. Median home prices there
were $204,000.
   Los Angeles, where prices rose 19.1 percent to a median of
$175,600, had the second highest appreciation rate, followed by San
Francisco, with an increase of 15.5 percent to $196,300.
   ``People just keep moving to California. Consequently, prices
keep going up,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions. ``Also, it's a diversified and
growing economy ... and there are a lot of middle and upper-income
jobs.''
   Nationally, prices rose 3.4 percent to a median of $88,900,
meaning half of the houses sold for more and half for less.
   ``Housing is mirroring the economy virtually all over the
country,'' said John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist.
``... Where the economy is very, very good, we find that housing is
very, very good. ... Likewise where housing is weak, so is the
economy.''
   Home prices in New York and the larger cities in New England
remain among the nation's highest, but they have not been going up
as fast as in previous years.
   The year-to-year appreciation rate in New York was 4.9 percent
to a median price of $191,900; in Boston, 3.8 percent to $182,900;
in Hartford, 7.6 percent to $169,000 and in Providence, 8.9 percent
to $130,400.
   Appreciation rates were also higher than the national median in
northern manufacturing cities, where prices are among the lowest in
the United States. Buffalo, N.Y., had the fifth best appreciation
rate in the country at 14.4 percent. Chicago, Columbus, Ohio;
Detroit and Grand Rapids, Mich., all reported appreciation rates of
9.2 percent.
   Tuccillo attributed the resurgence in the Midwest to the
comeback in the manufacturing sector which is benefiting from
strong export sales spurred by the devalued dollar.
   The steepest declines in home prices from a year ago were in
areas dependent on the oil industry. The median resale price fell
12.7 percent to $56,900 in Oklahoma City, 10.2 percent to $65,200
in San Antonio, Texas, and 6 percent to $64,000 in Baton Rouge, La.
   ``The bad news is the oil price drop of a couple years ago is
still having ramifications in real estate, but it's not new bad
news,'' Obrinsky said, noting what may be early signs of
improvement.
   When compared with the first quarter of this year, home prices
rose 5.5 percent in Houston and a little bit better than even, up
0.7 percent, in Oklahoma City.
   Also, the pace of sales in Texas improved 8 percent between the
first and second quarters, nearly as good as the national average.
   ``I'm glad to see that, but it's not enough yet to say they've
made the turn,'' Obrinsky said.
   Nationally, the Realtors group said the resale pace of
condominiums and single-family homes, spurred by
lower-than-expected mortgage interest rates, picked up in the
second quarter.
   Thirty-two states reported an increase in seasonally adjusted
sales rates from the first quarter. Fifteen states and the District
of Columbia reported slackening sales, while the pace was unchanged
in three states.
   Nationally, existing homes sold at an annual rate of 3.99
million units in the second quarter, 9.3 percent higher than the
first quarter but 0.5 percent lower than the same period a year
earlier.
   ``I think essentially what we have here ... is a case of
interest rates being more moderate than expected along with demand
being a little bit stronger,'' Tuccillo said.

<HEAD>Catholic Church Applies To Sell Lottery Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHEBOYGAN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic parish has applied to
sell tickets for Wisconsin's new lottery, and the church secretary
says more churches may take up the idea.
   State officials said Sts. Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church
appears to be the first religious institution in Wisconsin to apply
to sell tickets.
   But even if the application is granted, the church has been
ordered to wait until after Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland
reviews the matter, the Rev. Richard Fleischman, pastor of the
church, said Thursday.
   Fleischman said he did not expect the application to be approved
because the parish would only sell the tickets at its bingo games,
about once a week.
   ``But I thought, `What the heck. It's worth a try.' ... It's not
like we'd be selling them daily at the rectory,'' the priest said.
   Janet Maurin, the church's secretary, predicts other churches
that operate bingo games also will apply to sell lottery tickets to
help pay for financially strapped parochial schools.
   The lottery receives up to 100 applications a day, so more
churches may be applying, said lottery spokesman Rick Berg. He said
churches would be treated the same as the 3,500 commercial
retailers who also have applied to sell tickets. The approval
process includes background checks of all people listed on the
application.
   Many clergy in Wisconsin argued gambling was sinful and opposed
the lottery when the proposal was made. The games are scheduled to
begin in September, almost 18 months after voters approved them.
   ``With the Catholic Church depending on bingo, they don't feel
that way around here,'' Maurin said.
   Fleischman said he wished the church could avoid fund-raisers
that involved gambling, but he said they were necessary to meet the
monthly expenses of the parish and school.
   ``The fact is some people contribute more when they're having a
little fun, too,'' he said.
   There's no estimate on how much the church might make off the
lottery. Retailers receive 5 percent commissions on ticket sales.

   A House panel on Thursday considered federal
regulations on deadly looking toy guns that police sometimes
mistake for the real thing.
   An outright ban on the toys, among the topics of a House
hearing, is opposed by toy manufacturers, whose products often are
exact replicas of machine guns and assault rifles.
   The $300 million-a-year industry supports a measure requiring
them to identify their harmless products with bright orange
markings.
   But ban supporters say that bits of tape or paint aren't enough
to assure police officers that they aren't staring down the barrel
of a real threat.
   The hearing by the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
consumer protection was chaired by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., who
showed what appeared to be an Israeli-made Uzi machine gun. ``Is it
real, or is it a toy?'' Florio asked the audience.
   It was a water pistol. But Florio also showed an actual Uzi, and
the two were all but identical.
   Florio and police experts showed several examples of actual
firearms and obvious toy knock-offs, including replicas of a MAC-10
machine pistol and a .45-caliber pistol.
   The hearing came four days after an incident in Woodbridge,
N.J., in which a police officer was wounded trying to apprehend a
man armed with a real-looking toy pistol.
   Patrolman William McSweeney was wounded in the leg by another
policeman's gun that discharged in a struggle with a suspect. The
suspect's weapon turned out to be a replica of a .45 automatic.
   Two bills are pending in Congress to regulate such
``look-alike'' guns.
   One, sponsored by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., would require tne
orange markings. The other, offered by Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.,
calls for an outright ban on any toy gun resembling a real weapon.
   Levine said his legislation ``is meant to make child's play
safer than it is. It is not meant to ban all toy guns, just those
that are highly realistic.''
   Nationally syndicated television consumer advocate David
Horowitz testified that New York City police last year confiscated
more than 1,400 toy guns used in crimes.
   Horowitz himself was held hostage during a live TV broadcast
last year by a man holding what later turned out to be a fake gun.
   ``I could see the gun, and so could my colleagues on the set,
and there was no doubt in any of our minds that it was the real
thing,'' he said.
   Horowitz said toy manufacturers refuse to stop selling
look-alike guns, because they sell better than unrealistic plastic
weapons.
   Toy manufacturers supported Dole's bill, calling for the orange
markings, but said the Levine measure was too harsh.
   They said a ban on toy guns would cost jobs in the toy industry,
although guns represent less than 1 percent of the overall dollar
value of toy sales.

<HEAD>Chateau's Historic But Leaky Roof to Be Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THOIRY, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of a castle built for the
finance minister of King Francis II are selling slate tiles from
its historic but leaky roof to raise money for badly needed
renovations.
   Vicountess Annabelle de la Panouse, a native of Waysata, Minn.,
ordered workers to remove 67,000 gray slate tiles one-by-one and
save those in the best condition. They were installed on the
chateau of Thoiry, now a tourist attraction, 125 years ago during
the reign of Napoleon III.
   The vicountess said renovation of the 60-room chateau was being
delayed by lack of funds for roof repair, which will cost about $1
million.
   ``Some rooms I started but had to stop because it was raining on
the paint work,'' she said.
   As with many other French historical sites maintained by private
families without government funds, the chateau's owners seek ways
to exploit its picturesque country setting and long history to
increase revenue.
   It has an African animal preserve with more than 1,200 animals,
and another generator of revenue is an outdoor concert series on
the grounds.
   Roof tiles will be sold in the chateau gift shop with
certificates of authenticity. In addition to helping restore the
chateau, those buying the tiles will have something with practical
use, Madame de la Panouse said.
   ``You can buy some colored chalk and make your shopping list on
the slate, which comes in all different sizes and shapes,'' she
said. ``It is certainly more elegant than using a scrap of paper or
the back of an envelope.''
   Archives and collections exhibited on the ground floor include
reports of the national treasury, letters from Louis XIV and the
pitcher and wash basin in Sevres porcelain used by Marie-Antoinette
while awaiting the guillotine in Conciergerie Prison.
   Also on display are one of two waltz scores by Frederick Chopin
given to Clemence de la Panouse, a 19th century arts patron.
   The chateau was built in 1564 for Raoul Moreau, who served as
finance minister for Francis II and his successors Charles IX and
Henry III. It passed among family members through 14 generations
and 400 years to Madame de la Panouse's husband, Paul.

   The Senate today approved 90-4 a Pentagon
budget bill that includes restrictions on spending for American
troops overseas as a message to U.S. allies to do more for allied
defense, and new restrictions on Pentagon consultants.
   It was the second attempt by the Senate to approve a defense
bill President Reagan will accept. Reagan vetoed the first measure
last week because of cuts in his Star Wars budget along with arms
control restrictions he opposed.
   The new version retains the same Star Wars reductions, but none
of the arms control limitations. It will now go to a House-Senate
conference committee to resolve differences between the two
chambers' versions.
   The vote was the last major item on the Senate agenda before a
summer recess for next week's Republican presidential convention.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; and William Proxmire,
D-Wis. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Thad Cochran,
R-Miss.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn.; and James Exon, D-Neb.
   Earlier today, the Senate gave voice vote approval to a
``burden-sharing'' proposal backed by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   The plan orders a major review by the Pentagon of U.S. overseas
commitments, a new cap on U.S. troop deployments to Japan and South
Korea, and a new ceiling on spending for U.S. military personnel
stationed overseas. U.S. allies would have to pay for the American
troops if the costs rise above the 1988 levels.
   But before adopting the amendment, the Senate voted 59-36 to
eliminate a provision for a 10 percent reduction in the total of
American dependents stationed overseas with servicemen.
   ``I can't think of anything more damaging to the morale of our
troops than to limit dependents,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
an opponent of the limit.
   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said, ``enough is enough. We
have 413,000 dependents worldwide. That is far more than any other
nation in history.''
   There has been an increasingly loud chorus of election-year
congressional calls for more defense help, particularly from Japan
and European members of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``Despite the shift in economic fortunes'' since World War II,
``the United States bears a disproportionate share of the cost of
the common defense,'' Nunn said Wednesday.
   ``Someplace, sometime, we have to draw the line,'' said Nunn.
``I hope this will stimulate a more equitable burden-sharing.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, agreed: ``There's a limit to the
pocketbooks of the taxpayers of the United States.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said, ``There have
been legitimate complaints in the United States that we are bearing
a disproportionately large burden in NATO today.''
   Later, the chamber gave voice vote endorsement to an amendment
by Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., which would require defense
consultants to register and list all their clients.
   Pryor's amendment arises in the wake of the ongoing Pentagon
bribery investigation, which involves allegations that consultants
paid Defense Department officials for inside information about
future contracts. No charges have yet been filed.
   ``How bad do we want this system to get before we finally pay
some attention to it?'' Pryor asked.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate voted to add a Pentagon spending
plan praised by Reagan to its latest defense budget effort.
   In addition, the chamber, with all Republicans voting ``no,''
voted 49-47 approval of a Democratic-backed plan to provide $27
million in humanitarian aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels after Oct.
1. The vote could mean a possible second vote in Congress this fall
on releasing $16.3 million in stockpiled weapons to the Contras,
who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Last week, Reagan vetoed the bill which authorizes the Pentagon
budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. He specifically
objected to cuts in his proposed Star Wars budget and
Democratic-backed restrictions on arms control policies.
   The authorization measure is the first step of the two-track
congressional budget process, which also includes an appropriation
bill to pay for the programs authorized in the earlier legislation.
   The bill now under consideration is the Pentagon appropriation
bill. As it worked on the measure late Wednesday, the Senate voted
90-2 approval of an amendment which, in essence, added the earlier
Senate version of the authorization bill.
   When the Senate is finished, the entire matter will go to a
House-Senate conference committee to work out differences between
the bill and the companion measure passed two months ago by the
House.
   The Senate appropriation bill includes $4 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. But
the Senate version of the authorization bill provides $4.6 billion.
   The latter figure is closer to Reagan's original request of $4.8
billion for SDI, which receives $3.9 billion in the current fiscal
year.
   In addition, the Senate version does not have any of the arms
control restrictions Reagan opposes.
   The vote was part of a complicated legislative tactic to work
out a defense spending compromise that Reagan will approve, Nunn
told his colleagues.
   ``Tonight, we begin the process of putting Humpty Dumpty back
together again,'' Nunn told his colleagues. ``This may be mission
impossible, but I'm going to try.''
   Reagan vetoed the defense bill despite the advice of Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and national security adviser Colin
Powell, who both said it should be signed. They were involved in
earlier negotiations with congressional leaders over the
legislation.
   ``We need to have the executive branch sort out whom the
Congress should work with on national security issues,'' said Nunn.
``We have to know who's speaking for the administration. Can we
deal with the secretary of defense, can we deal with the national
security adviser?''

   A financial planner who managed investments for
about 50 doctors has skipped town, leaving a note of apology and
$25 million of his clients' money unaccounted for.
   Henry Gherman, 51, handled pension funds, personal investments
and managed medical offices for South Florida clients who received
copies of a handwritten letter of apology in the mail Wednesday.
   ``By the time you receive this letter, I will be gone,'' the
letters said. ``I have run away.''
   Gherman fled the Miami area Monday and sources close to the case
believe he may have left the country.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said Gherman and his companies are
under investigation for possible wire fraud, bank fraud,
embezzlement and interstate transportation of stolen property.
   ``I have taken this action because I am unable to face the
humiliation, disgrace and consequences'' that would follow once his
company, Financial & Investment Planning Inc., collapsed, the notes
said. He addded that he would try to return the doctors' money.
   ``(I) have been unable to come up with any solution other than
running,'' he wrote. ``I am truly sorry.''
   A Dade Circuit judge on Wednesday granted a request by 12 of
Gherman's clients to appoint a receiver to oversee the finances of
Gherman, his family and his companies.
   ``All we know is that Henry Gherman is not here and a large
amount of money is not here,'' said Jay Solowsky, attorney for the
doctors.
   The doctors also filed a $25 million lawsuit accusing Gherman of
fraudulently shifting clients' money to his wife and two children.
   Solowsky said Gherman accepted money from clients to invest in
certificates of deposit but that banks had no record of CDs being
purchased. Gherman also accepted money to buy medical malpractice
insurance for his clients but failed to pay premiums, Solowsky said.
   Gherman is neither a lawyer nor an accountant and his companies
are not registered with the state as an investment adviser,
Solowsky said.
   Gherman, the son of a waitress, was hailed as a financial whiz
kid when he sold $1 million worth of insurance in one year for the
John Hancock Co., and his investment savvy made him a millionaire
before he was 30. But his financial troubles began in July 1969,
when Gherman, then 34, filed for personal bankruptcy, listing $1
million in unpaid bills for casinos, hotel rooms, credit card
purchases, clothes and flowers.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's wife encouraged New
York's health commissioner to award a $113,000 research contract to
a California university that later paid $73,000 of that to her
brother, state officials said Thursday.
   Matilda Cuomo's brother, Joseph Raffa of San Diego, exchanged
the research money for a $48,000-a-year job with a California
company that he later unsuccessfully recommended be hired by New
York state to continue the cancer registry research work he had
begun, the newspaper Newsday reported.
   The contract, with the University of California at San
Francisco, was designed to study how New York might benefit from a
computerized and regionalized cancer registry system being
developed in California, said Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for
New York state Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod.
   Cancer registries are used by researchers to track where cancer
cases are occurring.
   Cuomo, in a statement issued by his office, defended his wife as
someone who ``has voluntarily contributed extraordinary amounts of
her time and energy ... to improving health care and education in
New York.''
   ``Any suggestion that she would do anything for any reason other
than to help the people of this state, would be both inaccurate and
terribly unfair,'' Cuomo said, noting that his wife and her brother
``have been active volunteers in the fight against cancer for many
years.''
   The 18-month study that ended last summer was arranged for Raffa
by Axelrod and former New York state Thruway Executive Director
Alexander Levine, who a state investigation panel has recommended
face criminal prosecution on an unrelated matter.
   Raffa, contacted Thursday morning at his California home by The
Associated Press, defended the research project and said he did it
out of a desire to help people, not to make money.
   ``I'm trying to do a good thing for humanity and I get kicked in
the behind for it,'' Raffa said. ``She (Mrs. Cuomo) never twisted
anybody's arm. First of all, she's not dumb enough to do that and
Axelrod is too smart. If he didn't believe in the project, he
wouldn't have done it.''
   Axelrod, through Tarlton, said he hadn't been pressured to enter
into the contract. Levine refused to be interviewed for the Newsday
story.
   The Long Island newspaper said Raffa had no experience in public
health statistics work, but he did have computer expertise before
taking on the cancer registry research work.
   A specialist in cancer registries and head of New Mexico's tumor
registry program, Dr. Mary Lerchen, reviewed Raffa's work for
Newsday and said ``the information gathered by the author was
neither comprehensive nor documented.''
   Axelrod said, however, he was satisfied with the study and that
New York ``learned a great deal about the cancer registry, its
potential, its problems.''
   Tarlton said some of Raffa's recommendations were implemented
while others were not because of their high cost. She said the
university subcontracted for the research work with Raffa and
that's how he got the $73,000.
   Levine, a long-time aide to Cuomo, resigned his highway post
last year after it was revealed that he had established a computer
software business, headed by his daughter and other Levine
associates, that engineering companies seeking to do business with
the Thruway were encouraged to use. The State Investigation
Commission has recommended that Levine be prosecuted for extortion,
a recommendation federal authorities are considering.

   U.S. arms control officials said
Thursday that a U.S.-Soviet nuclear test experiment next week in
Nevada would be a major step toward finalizing long-stalled
treaties on limiting nuclear explosions.
   Soviet scientists will for the first time on Aug. 17 monitor a
U.S. underground nuclear blast at the Nevada Test Site as part of
efforts to assess techniques for verifying the treaties signed in
the mid-1970s.
   On Sept. 14, U.S. scientists will observe a nuclear explosion at
the Soviet testing ground near Semipalatinsk.
   ``We believe there have been likely violations by the Soviet
Union of these treaties in the past ... The problem is inadequate
verification,'' said Paul Robinson, chief U.S. negotiator at the
nuclear testing talks in Geneva.
   ``I believe that the confidence building of achieving effective
verification is going to break the roadblock between us ... and be
a very significant step in allowing us to move forward,'' he told
reporters in a U.S. government-sponsored satellite broadcast from
Washington to five European cities.
   The 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty prohibit nuclear blasts with a yield of more than
150,000 tons of TNT.
   Neither treaty has been ratified because of problems over
verification.
   During the verification tests, the United States will use a
system known by the acronym CORRTEX to measure the yields of the
blasts. CORRTEX, which stands for continuous reflectrometry for
radius versus time experiment, determines the yield of a nuclear
explosion by measuring the shock wave from the blast.
   ``If the Soviets will agree to the use of this type of
measurement, we feel confident that these two treaties will be
effectively verifiable and we will be prepared to submit them to
the Senate for ratification,'' said Victor E. Alessi, director of
the Energy Department's Office of Arms Control.
   ``We are confident the test will demonstrate the effectiveness
of CORRTEX and ... that there will be no further need for tests,''
he said.
   Alessi said the cost of the project, agreed to in December at
the U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington, was $25 million.
   The project, he said, ``involves for the first time sending
large numbers of United States scientists to a distant and remote
part of the Soviet Union.''
   Robinson said 45 Soviet scientists were at the Nevada Test Site
and the United States would have a similar number monitoring the
Soviet explosion.

<DATELINE>FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, countering George Bush's
assertion that a Dukakis presidency would weaken the country,
portrayed himself Thursday as a tough-minded leader who would
strengthen conventional forces and weed out Pentagon waste.
   ``We've got to put our defense dollars where our defense needs
are greatest,'' Dukakis said in a speech at New York University
before heading to New Jersey to tour the Army base at Fort Dix.
   ``We've got to use those dollars to buy weapons that work,'' he
said. ``And we've got to to manage those dollars to strengthen our
military forces, not to line the pockets of dishonest contractors
and wheeler-dealer consultants.''
   The Democratic nominee, on a two-day campaign trip to five
states, spent eight weeks at Fort Dix in 1955 _ receiving basic
training after joining the Army. From Fort Dix, Dukakis was
traveling to Connecticut for several receptions. He campaigns in
Virginia and Florida on Friday.
   During his tour of Fort Dix, Dukakis fired a rifle on the target
range. ``It was fun to be out there,'' he told reporters later at
the base gates.
   Dukakis also toured a C-141 transport plane and a tank training
area. He told reporters he thought it was a mistake that the Reagan
administration is cutting by the number of Army tanks it will buy
in the next five years. That ``deprives our soldiers of the
equipment we need and drives up the cost of each tank by 30
percent,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked by reporters for his reaction to the increase in the prime
lending rate by major U.S. banks, Dukakis replied, ``I think it's
very regrettable. I think it's what happens after eight years of
borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.''
   In the audience for the NYU speech was New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, Mayor Ed Koch, local leaders of Jesse Jackson's presidential
campaign and Dukakis advisers on defense and foreign policy
matters, including former Defense Secretary Harold Brown.
   The always-controversial Koch yawned throughout Dukakis' speech.
Afterward, Koch said he supported Dukakis but would appreciate some
encouragement from the Dukakis campaign.
   ``I will go where they will ask me to go; I won't go where they
don't want me to go,'' Koch said.
   Cuomo, who introduced Dukakis, said Bush's only responsibility
during the Reagan years has been to head the administration's
anti-drug efforts.
   ``And we are losing that war,'' Cuomo said. ``This country and
this world cannot afford second-rate leadership in these critical
times.''
   Dukakis sounded a similar theme in his speech, although he did
not refer by name to Bush, who has portrayed the Democratic nominee
as weak on foreign policy and defense issues.
   ``This November, we Americans face a fundamental choice,''
Dukakis said. ``We can seize the opportunity to restore America's
leadership in the world, or we can settle for second best.''
   Referring to Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, Dukakis
said he would be a president who ``believes that we don't need more
rhetoric or photo opportunities in the war against drugs; we need
results.''
   Dukakis aides had billed the speech as a major address on
foreign policy and national security, but the Massachusetts
governor unveiled no new positions on either front. On Thursday,
the aides said the speech was a ``framework'' of Dukakis' positions
that he wanted to give before the Republican National Convention
and that the governor would be more specific about his ideas in the
next few weeks.
   Dukakis repeated his desire to continue Reagan's progress on
nuclear arms reductions with the Soviet Union but lambasted the
president's ``Star Wars' space-based missile defense program as
unnecessary and too expensive.
   Dukakis promised to beef up conventional forces with new tanks,
equipment and supplies and said the military should be considered
for use in anti-drug and anti-terrorism efforts.
   He also recalled the words of John F. Kennedy to emphasize his
belief that United States' international strength depends on a
strong domestic economy.
   ``He understood that building a full-employment, low-inflation
economy that creates opportunity for every single citizen in this
country was essential to our strength at home and abroad,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``Above all, we've got to have a real leader in the White House
who will insist that when it comes to our national security we're
going to make decisions based not on what's good for one company or
one military service or one political party, but on what's good for
the United States of America,'' Dukakis said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the National Rifle Association's
staunchest congressional supporters bitterly criticized the group
Thursday after the organization attacked his support for a
seven-day waiting period in handgun purchases.
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, a conservative
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said a critical NRA
letter sent to his constituents was ``downright erroneous, false
and plays on hysteria in an attempt to get me to change my vote.''
   Sensenbrenner was strongly backed by Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif.,
a Judiciary Committee member who has backed past NRA positions; and
Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., who considers himself a strong
supporter of the right to own guns.
   Lungren called the attack on Sensenbrenner ``a pretty desperate
letter against one of their supporters.''
   Bateman, whose constituents received an NRA letter against the
waiting period that did not attack him personally, said: ``I am
shocked and disappointed at the excessive language and tactics used
by the NRA in the letter to my constituents.''
   This is not the first time in recent months that longtime
supporters of the NRA were sharply critical of the organization.
   In May, Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., criticized the NRA for
attacking him in his state when he and the pro-gun group differed
over a version of legislation to ban undetectable plastic guns.
   ``I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' Exon said
then.
   The waiting period measure, part of omnibus drug legislation
that the House will vote on in September, would require a seven-day
wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer.
   The dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a sworn
statement that includes a description of the gun, the serial
number, the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Police may,
but are not required to, conduct a background check.
   Purchasers who would be prohibited from buying the handgun would
be those already ineligible under existing federal law: convicted
felons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those
adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution,
those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under
indictment for a felony.
   Twenty-two states already have enacted a waiting period of
varying duration.
   The ``emergency'' letter to NRA members in Sensenbrenner's
district said the lawmaker, along with sponsors of the legislation,
``are attempting to scapegoat the drug problem on the backs of
law-abiding American gun owners _ to use it as an excuse to impose
total federal gun control on America.''
   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for
Legislative Action, the group's lobbying arm, also wrote:
   `I have in my hand a letter dated July 1988 from the
Sensenbrenner Campaign Committee for Re-Election proclaiming his
fight for gun owners' rights ... HA. With support like that, you
might as well have Ted Kennedy representing you.''
   Kennedy, D-Mass. is one of the most liberal senators and is a
strong supporter of handgun control.
   Sensenbrenner, noting the waiting period is part of the drug
bill, told reporters: ``If the National Rifle Association wishes to
defeat Congress' singular effort this year to put an end to drug
trafficking, that's a record that they will have to live with.''
   He quoted from an old NRA statement saying waiting periods would
be effective in ``reducing crimes of passion and in preventing
people with criminal records and dangerous mental illness from
acquiring guns.''
   LaPierre, in an interview, said the NRA supported waiting
periods in the early 1970s, but changed its mind a few years later
when it found ``they don't stop crime. It's simply red tape for
honest people.''
   LaPierre said the group singled out Sensenbrenner for special
criticism _ despite his past support of the NRA _ because of his
campaign letter characterizing himself as a strong supporter of gun
ownership.
   Sensenbrenner voted for the waiting period in the Judiciary
Committee and added Thursday he will support the language on the
House floor.
   ``Come on. You don't have it both ways,'' LaPierre said.
``Everybody knows this (the waiting period) is a big gun vote.
You're either for gun owners or against gun owners.''
   ``If someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rights
away ... we're going to fight back. That's what sportsmen and gun
owners expect us to do.''
   The NRA contends the waiting period would amount to a national
registration of handguns, would cost ``hundreds of millions'' of
dollars to enforce, and would require ``a bureaucrat's permission''
to buy a gun.
   Supporters of the legislation deny all those claims.

<HEAD>Archbishop's Talks With Iranian Raise Hopes of Hostage Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, who
conferred with a senior Iranian official about British hostages in
Lebanon, said Thursday that only quiet negotiations can free the
captives.
   The talks raised hopes that Church of England envoy Terry Waite
and two other Britons among 18 foreigners missing and believed
kidnapped in Lebanon may be freed. Most of the hostages are
believed held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   ``It does seem there is a turn in the tide of events,'' Waite's
cousin, John Waite, said in a TV interview. ``We are very, very
cautious. But I think this is a small step along what perhaps is a
long road toward the release of all the hostages.''
   In a separate development, diplomat David Reddaway, the first
British envoy to enter Iran in a year, left London and said he will
raise the hostage issue with Iranian authorities.
   ``I think it is bound to help,'' Reddaway said at Heathrow
Airport. ``The main thing I will be able to do is to remind the
Iranian government ... that we would hope that any government that
could influence people holding hostages would do so.''
   Neither the Iranian Embassy nor Runcie, who left for a
three-week vacation in Philadelphia, would comment on the
archbishop's meeting Wednesday night with Iranian envoy Mohamed
Reza Said Mohamedi.
   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to
secure the release of American hostages believed held by
pro-Iranian extremists. Nine Americans are among the 18 hostages.
   Mohamedi, an official on the European desk of the Foreign
Ministry in Tehran, arrived in London on Wednesday via Geneva for
what Waite's family said were supposed to be secret talks.
   It was the first known meeting between the spiritual leader of
the Church of England and an Iranian official since Waite vanished.
   ``I believe that everyone who is genuinely concerned about the
improvement of Anglo-Iranian relations and about the British
hostages in Lebanon will recognize that there are times when
progress can only be made quietly,'' Runcie said before flying to
the United States.
   Meanwhile, a British Broadcasting Corp. Middle East
correspondent, Keith Graves, reported that control of the hostages
held in Beirut has passed from Lebanese Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists to a group of ``hard-line Iranian Revolutionary
Guards.''
   Graves said the hard-liners opposed Hashemi Rafsanjani, head of
Iran's armed forces, because of his agreement to a cease-fire in
its war with Iraq and his ``willingness'' to have the Western
hostages released from Lebanon.
   Reddaway planned to spend three weeks assessing whether Britain
should resume a diplomatic presence in Tehran.
   Britain withdrew its diplomats a year ago after one was beaten
up in an apparent reprisal for the arrest of an Iranian envoy in
northern England on shoplifting charges.
   The British Embassy was closed and the ambassador withdrawn in
1980 after a siege by revolutionary guards denouncing Britain as a
U.S. ally.
   The remaining diplomats worked out of the Swedish Embassy. One
Iranian envoy remains in Britain.
   British-Iranian relations have improved markedly in the past six
weeks.
   The Foreign Office, which insisted the government was not
involved in Runcie's talks, said the catalyst for sending a
diplomat back to Tehran was Iran's agreement July 18 to accept a
U.N. cease-fire in its war with Iraq.
   On the instructions of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, British
officials insist they will not bargain for the release of Britons
in Lebanon. But Britain is now the only Western European country
without diplomats in Tehran.
   The other Britons missing in Lebanon are television journalist
John McCarthy, who was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and teacher Brian
Keenan from Northern Ireland, who has been missing since April 11,
1986. Keenan holds dual British and Irish nationality.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   The longest held foreign hostage in Lebanon is American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The operator of Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant was hit Thursday with a $1.25 million fine,
largest in Nuclear Regulatory Commission history, because 33
reactor workers slept or were negligent on the job.
   The NRC also announced fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 against
the 33 present and former reactor operators _ the first such civil
penalties ever proposed for individual operators.
   It said the 33 fines ``involved sleeping and-or other acts of
inattention to duty'' at Philadelphia Electric Co.'s dormant Peach
Bottom plant on the Susquehanna River in Delta, Pa.
   The NRC called the levies ``proposed fines,'' explaining that
both Philadelphia Electric and the operators have 30 days to either
admit or deny the alleged violations. If they admit the
allegations, they still can seek to have the fines reduced or
withdrawn.
   If the allegations are denied, the NRC staff will study the
reasons why before making a decision on whether to uphold the
penalty. ``We say they violated the regulations, and unless they
demonstrate they did not, then the fine will be imposed as
proposed,'' said commission spokesman Frank Ingram.
   The $1.25 million fine is the largest since Congress gave the
NRC authority to issue civil penalties in 1969. The previous high
was a $900,000 fine against Toledo Edison Co. for an incident in
which the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ohio had a temporary loss of
cooling water.
   Peach Bottom, which sits near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border
and is capable of producing one million kilowatts of electric
power, was ordered shut down by the NRC on March 31, 1987, because
it posed ``an immediate threat to the public health and safety.''
   Sleeping on the job was so common at the plant that on one
occasion a shift superintendent and three of the four reactor
operators all dozed at once, according to testimony by an NRC
official at a commission hearing in April 1987.
   Philadelphia Electric officials said at a news conference in
Holtwood, Pa., that they had not decided whether to appeal the
record fine.
   ``We have a period of time to evaluate and make that decision.
We have not made it yet. We intend to review it very carefully
before we make that decision,'' company Chairman Joseph F. Paquette
Jr. said.
   Philadelphia Electric spokesman William Jones said the company
was ``relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and
that we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the
Peach Bottom restart plan.''
   In informing the company of the fine, the NRC staff said, ``All
levels of plant management at that time either knew or should have
known of these facts and either took no action or inadequate action
to correct this situation.''
   James Taylor, the NRC's deputy executive director for regional
operations, said in a letter to Philadelphia Electric that the
commission recognized that the utility had made ``extensive
personnel changes'' and had ordered reactor operators retrained.
   But Taylor said the fines were necessary to emphasize to the
company and others ``the significance of the problem, and to ensure
that corrective actions are long lasting.''
   In addition to the fines, the commission barred the utility from
placing ``in any operational position'' three officials who were
top-level managers at the plant in 1987. The officials held the
positions of operations engineer, superintendent of operations, and
plant manager.
   Corbin A. McNeill Jr., executive vice president for nuclear
operations, said the officials were still with the company, and
that they had been assigned to other, non-nuclear, responsibilities.
   Philadelphia Electric has been trying to get NRC permission to
restart the plant for almost a year. On the first anniversary of
the commission-ordered shutdown last March, the company said the
action had cost shareholders $72 million because of the cost of
purchasing replacement power.
   The company is the subject of a lawsuit filed in July by three
utilities that claimed they lost money because of inadequate
administration and maintenance that caused the Peach Bottom
shutdown.
   Public Service Electric & Gas Co., Atlantic City Electric Co.
and Delmarva Power & Light Co. filed suit seeking unspecified
damages. Philadelphia Electric responded that the charges were
unfounded.
   Atlantic Electric owns 7.5 percent of Peach Bottom, PSE&G owns
42.49 percent, Philadelphia Electric owns 42.49 percent and
operates the plant, and Delmarva owns the balance of the plant.

<HEAD>Relief Supplies Flown to Flooded Sudan; 10 Bodies Recovered From
Nile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worldwide groups promised food and airlifted
supplies Thursday into the Sudan, where torrential rains caused
massive flooding that left 1.5 million people homeless and at least
11 dead.
   In southern Egypt, rescue teams pulled 10 bodies out of the Nile
River after a cruiser capsized and sunk during a storm a day
earlier, the Middle East News Agency reported. They were identified
as six Italian tourists and four Egyptians.
   Ten Italian nationals and 13 Egyptians were missing, the
state-owned news agency said.
   Electric power was restored to parts of the Sudanese capital of
Khartoum, but the country still faced the dangers of an overflowing
Nile River and the possible outbreak of diseases.
   In its early Friday edition, the state-run al-Ahram daily said
33 airplanes carrying food, medicine and relief supplies had
arrived in Khartoum, including 20 from Egypt, seven from Saudi
Arabia and others from Italy, Britain and Jordan.
   In Rome, the World Food Program announced Thursday it was
supplying more than 6,000 tons of emergency food aid to flood
victims.
   ``The quantities, together with bilateral aid provided from
locally available stocks, will be sufficient to feed ... about 1
million people'' for one month, the agency said in a statement.
   The United States has arranged to airlift more than 850 rolls of
plastic sheets to serve as tents for some of the homeless. It is
also sending 1,200 tons of grain and food and $1 million worth of
other relief supplies.
   The Geneva-based International Red Cross said it was sending
2,000 tons of food. Red Cross offices in Britain, the Netherlands
and Denmark are flying in 1,000 tents, nearly 50,000 blankets and 1
million water purification tablets.
   National Red Cross societies and governments also have pledged
$615,000 to purchase flour, cooking oil and other supplies.
   The World Food Program said relief workers fear outbreaks of
cholera, dysentery and malaria.
   Sudanese officials blamed the recent floods on inadequate
drainage systems. Last week's rainfall in Khartoum and its
surrounding areas was 8.4 inches, compared with only 1.44 inches
during all of 1987.
   Khartoum and three other cities in eastern and northern Sudan
have been declared disaster areas, and Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi has announced a nationwide state of emergency for six
months.
   The Blue Nile, which converges at Khartoum with the White Nile
to form the Nile River, was rising rapidly behind the Sennar and
Rosseire dams.
   The possibility of the Nile overflowing its banks will be
determined during the last 10 days of August, Sudan's Irrigation
Minister Mahmoud Beshir said Thursday.
   MENA said Thursday that the Blue Nile had covered 150 houses on
the island of Tuti facing Khartoum, and the government was
instructing inhabitants to place sand bags along the river bank to
stop the rising waters.
   The Nile has surged beyond levels recorded in 1946, when it had
its worst flood on record, Khartoum's governor, Gen. El-Fateh
Abdoon, was quoted by MENA as saying.
   In Egypt, the steamer Nubia was sailing from Aswan to Luxor when
it capsized and sank near the town of Edfu in a storm Wednesday. It
was carrying 51 Italians and an Egyptian crew of 45.
   An Italian Embassy spokesman in Cairo said 35 Italians were
rescued, some suffering minor injuries and shock, on Wednesday. The
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the remaining
16 Italians were missing, and Egyptian police said they were
presumed dead.
   Twenty-seven Egyptian crewmen also were rescued Wednesday and
the body of one was picked up from the water. Thursday's recovery
of the bodies of four Egyptians left 13 Egyptian crewmen missing.
   Both Luxor and Aswan are favorite tourist resorts. Luxor is
famed for its Valley of the Kings Pharaonic necropolis and the
Karnak temple complex.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Issues Injunction Halting Louisiana Judicial
Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday halted fall
elections for state district court, family court and court of
appeal seats, saying he found that Louisiana's election laws
discriminate against black people.
   Attorneys for the state said they would appeal as soon as
possible, noting that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal last
week overturned a lower court injunction in a similar case dealing
with a Louisiana Supreme Court election.
   ``I conceive it to be my duty, having found violations, to
enjoin all district court, family court and court of appeal
elections until the governor of Louisiana and the Legislature have
had an opportunity to make changes in the judicial elections system
that will avoid such violations,'' U.S. District Judge John Parker
wrote in Thursday's order.
   He specified that the state laws violate a section of the U.S.
Voting Rights Act, which prohibits any practice that limits voting
rights on the basis of race.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer was out of town and could not be reached
immediately for comment.
   Blacks filed suit in 1986, contending that the present system
violates federal law by diluting minority voting strength. There
are only five blacks among the 178 state district judges, who
handle most civil and criminal trials, the plaintiffs said during
recent hearings.
   They had asked Parker for an injunction barring the elections
until the merits of the case could be decided. Their attorneys said
Thursday's order suggests that the judge will ultimately strike
Louisiana's election laws dealing with the judiciary.
   Primary elections for various judicial seats had been scheduled
Oct. 1, and runoffs if needed would have been held during the
November general elections. Under Louisiana's open primary system,
candidates from both parties run on the same primary ballot, and a
runoff is held between the two top vote-getters if no candidate
receives a majority.
   In most cases, judges are elected on an at-large basis in their
parish (the Louisiana equivalent of a county) or group of parishes,
rather than from single-member districts within each parish.
   The federal law requires single-member districts, blacks
contended.
   ``In the very near future, there are going to be a significant
number of black judges elected and the state judiciary is going to
be significantly integrated,'' Robert McDuff, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs, said after hearing of Parker's injunction.
   Assistant Attorney General Ken Dejean and attorney Robert Pugh,
handling the case for the state, said they are banking on relief
from the 5th Circuit.
   A federal judge in New Orleans halted a Louisiana Supreme Court
election at the request of blacks but the 5th Circuit threw out the
injunction.
   The federal appeals panel did not rule on the merits of the
case, but said that halting the election would irreparably harm the
Supreme Court candidates who had already spent money on the
campaigns.
   Two Supreme Court justices are elected at large from a
four-parish New Orleans-area district. Other high court districts
in the state are single-member districts.
   The plaintiffs want at least one of the judges elected from a
New Orleans-only district where black voters are in the majority.

   Officials of a Catholic church readied
Thursday for as many as 20,000 people expected at a feast day
celebration this weekend after parishioners claiming to have
received divine messages predicted miracles would occur.
   Volunteers at St. John Neumann Roman Catholic Church answered
telephones and finished banners, while others hurried to finish an
altar and pulpit being constructed on the roof of the underground
church.
   Worshipers have chartered buses and booked hotel rooms to come
to the church for Monday's Feast of the Assumption, the climax of
four days of worship and the day Roman Catholics celebrate their
belief in the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven.
   The church attracted attention after parishioners claimed to
have received messages from Mary during weekly rosary recitations
and predicted miracles of physical and spiritual healing would
occur coinciding with the feast.
   As word spread in the past month about the claims, the church
office was forced to install four new phone lines to handle
inquiries.
   Church officials are uncertain how many people will attend the
four days of worship, highlighted by a Monday evening service.
   Although the church's sanctuary seats 850, the Mass and rosary
Monday will be held outside to accommodate the pilgrims, said the
church's pastoral assistant, Cynthia Wynn.
   ``We feel like people will be all over that field and spread
across the parking lot,'' she said, surveying a large grassy area
beneath the improvised rooftop altar.
   Parishioner David Garza, an attorney, said trying to plan the
event without knowing how many will attend hasn't been easy.
   ``We are one of the smallest parishes in town. We don't have a
lot of money, but people have been very generous,'' he said.
   Ideas for how to accommodate the crowd were based on his trip
last September to see Pope John Paul II in San Antonio, Garza said.
   ``I started writing in my notebook all the things that I
remembered from the pope's visit _ medical tents, water,
ambulances,'' he said.
   St. John Neumann will have 20 portable toilets, two medical
tents, two first-aid stations, and drinking water will be
available, he said.
   Since early spring, parishioners Mike Slate, Mary Constancio and
Theresa Werner have claimed to receive messages from the Virgin
Mary during Monday night rosary service, and attendance has swelled
from a handful to more than 1,000.
   At Monday's outdoor service, the church plans to distribute
50,000 copies of a booklet containing the weekly messages, which
included predicting miracles during the festival and pleas to work
for peace.

   Forty-three years after her husband died in
office and 26 years after her own death, Eleanor Roosevelt is the
president's wife most admired by American women, according to a
poll in the September Ladies Home Journal.
   The wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt was named by 28 percent of the
women surveyed for the magazine by the Roper Organization.
   Nancy Reagan, the incumbent first lady, was second, with 26
percent.
   The rest of the most-admired were: Jacqueline Onassis, widow of
John F. Kennedy, 20 percent; Betty Ford, 17 percent; Rosalynn
Carter, 11 percent; Patricia Nixon, 7 percent; Lady Bird Johnson
and Mamie Eisenhower, 6 percent each; and Bess Truman, 5 percent.
   The percentages add up to more than 100 because some of those
polled named more than one.
   The poll, conducted among 1,000 women during the third week of
April, is projectable for the entire country with an error margin
of 3 percent, the magazine said.
   Sixty-nine percent of the women polled said that when a
president and his wife disagree on a controversial issue, she
should keep quiet about it in public. Twenty-five percent said she
should speak out, and 7 percent had no opinion.
   Forty-nine percent said a wife with a career should give it up
when her husband enters the White House. Forty-one percent said she
should keep working, and 10 percent were undecided.
   Asked how a president's wife should spend her time, 57 percent
suggested becoming active in a cause, 17 percent said be a helper
of her husband, 14 percent said entertain and attend ceremonies and
5 percent said get involved in government.

   When Congress returns from its Labor Day
recess, the Senate will join the controversy over whether a
developer can build a shopping mall adjacent to the famous Civil
War battlefield at Manassas, Va.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests announced Thursday a hearing will
be held Sept. 8, a day after Congress returns, to consider
legislation directing the federal government to purchase the
542-acre William Center tract adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park.
   The Confederacy won two battles at Manassas just west of
Washington in 1861 and 1862.
   The subcommittee will hold the hearing on the bill passed by the
House on Wednesday, which orders the federal government to buy the
land.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who made the announcement of the
hearing, said he will introduce legislation to purchase only part
of the developer's tract. Estimates of the purchase price in the
House bill have ranged from $15 million to $100 million.
   The House bill provides for the federal government to take
immediate ownership of the developer's tract under a rarely used
procedure known as a legislative taking. A fair price for the
developer would be worked out later.
   In addition, the bill authorizes up to $30 million to close two
major highways crossing the park.
   Officials at the Office of Management and Budget and Interior
Department have said they would recommend that President Reagan
veto the measure if Congress enacts it in its current form.
   Developer John T. Hazel purchased the land two years ago for
less than $10 million. He wants to build 1.2 million square feet of
retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office space and 560 homes.
   Opponents contend the development would mar the natural sanctity
of the park.

   The non-binding document said President Reagan should tell

improve its human rights record.
   The resolution said there is ``a persistent pattern of severe

   Soviet experts left Thursday after
winding up inspections of U.S. cruise missiles at two sites under
the new treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range nuclear
weapons.
   The 20 inspectors posed for photographs and bid farewell to
their U.S. escorts before boarding an Aeroflot flight back to
Moscow.
   The inspectors arrived Monday and then broke up into two teams
to count missiles at Florennes Air Base, 40 miles south of
Brussels, and the European Repair Facility at nearby Gosselies.
   ``It was a very good inspection ... characterized by a very
cooperative spirit,'' said U.S. Air Force Col. John Fer, head of
the U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency's European office at Rhein-Main
Air Base in Germany. ``It was cordial but at the same time it was
very professional and very well done.''
   The experts finished their inspections Wednesday and then went
on a tour of Brussels and shopped for T-shirts, souvenirs,
chocolate and toys, the U.S. escorts said.
   Belgium is the fourth Western European country the Soviets have
visited since the 60-day inspection period began July 1.
   Fer said there are additional missile facilities in Germany and
Italy that the inspectors have yet to check.
   The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five
Western European countries. U.S. experts are inspecting 133 sites
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The inspections, giving the Soviets and the Americans an
unprecedented look at each other's facilities, can last up to 24
hours, with a possible eight-hour extension.
   In Belgium, the Soviets visited Florennes where U.S. officials
have said 16 ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares are
kept along with four launchers and eight spares. The 485th U.S.
Tactical Missile Wing is based at Florennes.
   There was no indication how many unarmed cruise missiles are at
the Gosselies facility, which is run by the Belgian defense
contractor Sabca.
   On June 21, there were 55 missiles at the plant, which is the
only one in Europe that maintains and repairs cruise missiles, U.S.
officials said.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty provides for
elimination within three years of all U.S. and Soviet land-based
missiles with ranges from about 300 to 3,400 miles. President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the treaty in
December in Washington.

   Sen. Bob Dole's request not to have his name
put in nomination for the presidency at the Republican National
Convention may mean he's a top candidate as the party's vice
presidential nominee, Kansas Republicans said Thursday.
   Party officials also said Dole's decision is a sign he wants to
promote party unity for Vice President George Bush, who is assured
of receiving the presidential nomination next week.
   State GOP Chairman Fred Logan Jr. announced Dole's decision not
to have his name put in nomination for the presidency Wednesday.
Dole also asked the state's 34 delegates to vote for Bush on the
first ballot.
   ``It shows Sen. Dole is very serious in his support for the vice
president,'' Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, chairman of the state's
convention delegation, said of Dole's request. ``I think he's on
the short list (of possible vice presidential nominees).''
   Bush is not expected to announce his choice of a running mate
until the last day off the convention.

nominee, and 42 percent would choose Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis for
president if the election were held this month.
   But the poll, conducted for the Herald-Journal and WYFF-TV, has
a margin of error of 3.5 percent, enough to eliminate Bush's lead.
   A total of 829 registered voters were interviewed throughout the
state from Aug. 5-7.

<HEAD>New Standards Added To New Orleans Taxi Codes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inspectors are spot-checking New Orleans'
1,615 taxi drivers for price gouging, faulty meters and other
mechanical problems in anticipation of next week's Republican
National Convention.
   The spot-checks will continue through the GOP convention and
beyond, said Byron Woods, administrator of the New Orleans Taxicab
Bureau.
   So far, Woods said, a team of 12 inspectors from his bureau and
the New Orleans Police Department found 35 cabs that were not
``adequate enough'' to be working the city streets. The drivers
were ordered to have the necessary repairs performed by the end of
this week, he said.
   Price gouging will probably be the main concern during the
Republican convention, Woods said. He added that very few cabbies
try to overcharge customers and none has had his New Orleans
license revoked in the past year because of overcharging.

<HEAD>Actress Brennan Recovers From Near-Fatal Car Accident</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Eileen Brennan, who nearly died in an
accident six years ago and fought a subsequent addiction to
painkillers, says she has found tranquility and a revitalized
career.
   Shortly after the success of the movie ``Private Benjamin,''
Brennan was hit by a car in Venice, Calif., on the night of Oct.
27, 1982, when she was having dinner with co-star Goldie Hawn.
   Her legs were smashed, all the bones on the left side of her
face were broken, her left eye socket was shattered, and it seemed
impossible she would survive. But she fought her injuries with rage.
   ``I was no saint,'' she says in September's Ladies Home Journal.
``I was angry, and anger is a powerful emotion. It increased my
determination not to go under, to get well.''
   Her sons, Sam and Patrick, 11 and 10 at the time, were her
greatest help on her road to recovery, she says. ``They treated me
as if I really did have the strength, and of course, that gave me
the strength.''
   But painkillers were also a big part of her recovery. And two
years after the accident, Brennan, 50, entered the Betty Ford
Center to cure her addiction to drugs.
   ``We get addicted to dull the pain of life,'' she says. ``But
once we accept that life is tough and painful, we can move on and
grow and evolve.''
   Although her television series ``Off the Rack'' was canceled in
1986 after only six episodes, Brennan appeared in the film ``Sticky
Fingers'' last spring, has plans for a new television series, ``Off
Duty,'' and stars in the current film ``The New Adventures of Pippi
Longstocking.''

<HEAD>FDA Proposes Changes for Some Non-Prescription Cold Medicine
Formulas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday
proposed new rules for cold medications that would allow
over-the-counter sales of a prescription antihistamine and
eliminate another compound that has been in use for 50 years
because evidence shows it is of little value.
   The agency also said that as part of a review of all
non-prescription medications, researchers had determined that
products that treat several symptoms of the common cold at once are
``a convenience'' to patients ``who would otherwise have to take
several products to treat congested and runny noses, watery eyes,
headache and coughing.''
   It proposed that 14 drug combinations should continue to be
rated as ``safe and effective.'' Most of the major cough and cold
combination products on the market would continue under this rating.
   Products treating only single symptoms also would continue to be
available, the agency said.
   The FDA proposed that promethazine hydrochloride, an
antihistamine now available only by prescription, be converted to
non-prescription use in multi-ingrediant cold products.
   Another proposal calls for elimination of drug combinations that
use theophylline. The agency said that although theophylline
combinations have been used for years to ease labored breathing,
research shows there is no convincing evidence that these
combinations are of value.
   The agency said the combination of theophylline and ephedrine
has been in use for more than 50 years and the law did not require
that their effectiveness be tested before they were first marketed.
A 1962 law required such testing and the FDA is now reviewing all
non-prescription ingredients.
   If the proposed standard becomes final, some major products that
use drug combinations that include theophylline would have to be
reformulated or removed from the market. Among the products
affected would be Primatene Tablets, Bronkotabs and Bronkolixir.
   The proposed standard will be published in the Federal Register
on Friday, but would not become final until after an indefinite
period allowed for public comment, the FDA said.

<HEAD>Liberace's Sister Claims Trust Left Her Broke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sister of the late Liberace testified
that she was penniless while an attorney countered she had been
given more than $100,000 so far from a trust left by her
entertainer brother.
   Angie Liberace's testimony came in an increasingly bitter court
battle between a Beverly Hills, Calif., attorney who is executor of
Liberace's estate and five people challenging a will signed by
Liberace 13 days before his death last year.
   In her second day of testimony on Thursday, Ms. Liberace, 74,
criticized the trust set up to take care of her. She said her
brother had intended for her to have everything she needed without
having to be accountable to anyone.
   ``If I didn't have this trust, I wouldn't have to answer to you
people for every piece of food I swallow,'' she testified.
``Liberace didn't intend for me to have a trust.''
   The suit in state District Court seeks to oust attorney Joel
Strote as executor of the estate, valued at $18 million, and as
head of the Liberace Foundation for the Performing Arts, which
provides scholarships to nearly 30 colleges and universities.
   Strote was named executor in a will Liberace signed Jan. 22,
1987. Liberace died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS.
   Plaintiffs contend Liberace was too ill to understand more than
100 pages of documents when he signed the new will and trust.
   Defense witnesses, including the entertainer's sister-in-law,
Dora Liberace, have said he was alert and competent when he signed
the documents.
   Angie Liberace, the entertainer's only living sibling and one of
five plaintiffs in the case, testified Wednesday that she was no
longer able to live in the manner which her brother had wanted for
her.
   Attorneys representing Strote disagreed, saying the estate had
paid her more than $100,000 the past year.
   Liberace's will left his sister $590,000 plus a car and the use
of a Las Vegas condominium. A prior will had designated $450,000
for her.
   Strote testified earlier this year that he became alarmed at the
rate Ms. Liberace was spending money, and began watching
expenditures more closely. Defense attorney John O'Reilly Wednesday
cited trust fund payments for jewelry, travel and other expenses.
   ``You have made it out that I'm the spendthrift of Nevada when
I'm on charity,'' Mrs. Liberace replied. ``I don't have a nickel to
my name.''
   She said she was required to attend various functions for her
brother and ``most people pick up the tab, knowing I'm penniless.''
   She expressed bitterness with Strote for closing the Tivoli
Gardens, a plush restaurant on the city's east side that was a pet
project of the late entertainer. O'Reilly said the restaurant had
lost more than $5 million from 1982 to 1986.
   Also Wednesday, George Llinares, former Liberace valet and
houseman, recounted his years of service with Liberace. Llinares
said housekeeper Dorothy McMahon had a ``very close'' relationship
with Cary James, Liberace's companion the last six years of his
life.
   Along with Angie Liberace, James and Ms. McMahon, housekeeper
Gladys Luckie and Seymour Heller, Liberace's long-time manager, are
plaintiffs in the suit.

<HEAD>90 Vietnamese Boat People Want to Go Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 90 among thousands of Vietnamese boat
people who flooded this colony's shores in recent months have asked
to be returned home, a government spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Most of the refugees seeking a return trip _ about 70 _ have
come forward in the past week, since Hong Kong opened talks with
Hanoi about large-scale repatriation, said the spokeswoman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Vietnam has said it is ready to
take back refugees who want to return.
   After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Hong Kong considered all
Vietnamese arriving by boat as political refugees eligible for
resettlement in third countries.
   An estimated 23,000 refugees have come to this tiny British
colony, whose 5.5 million people already are crowded in the
20-square-mile enclave. Hong Kong, with its active business
community, is on the southeastern coast of China about 500 miles
from Vietnam's northern border.
   A new policy took effect in Hong Kong on June 16 to curb the
surging number of arrivals. It labels all incoming Vietnamese as
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation except those who can
prove that persecution drove them from communist Vietnam.
   Despite the new rules, about 7,000 Vietnamese boat people have
sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June, and Hong Kong has been
packing most of them into temporary detention centers.
   The government spokeswoman said some of those who requested
repatriation were classified as illegal immigrants. But she said
others were classified as refugees entitled to be resettled.
   She said she had no further details.
   Only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from Hong
Kong since 1978, including two in July.
   Officials of Hong Kong and Vietnam met in Hanoi on Aug. 3-4 to
discuss repatriations. No agreement was reached, but more talks
were expected.
   The repatriation applications of the 90 volunteers will be
forwarded to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees for discussion
with Hanoi. U.N. officials could not be reached immediately for
comment.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk, spiritual
leader of 550,000 Roman Catholics in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati,
was released from a hospital Thursday after treatment for a
ruptured brain artery.
   Pilarczyk, 53, waved to reporters and photographers from a
wheelchair before he was ushered into a waiting car.
   Doctors have said the archbishop may be able return to work in
about a month. His condition was listed as good, Karen Kinsella,
spokeswoman for Good Samaritan Hospital, said Thursday.
   Pilarczyk underwent surfery July 25 to repair an aneurysm near
the base of his brain. He suffered the aneurysm two days earlier as
he was vacationing in Gatlinburg, Tenn. He was moved to Cincinnati
for the operation.
   An aneurysm is a sac formed in the wall of an artery and is
blamed on a congenital weakness in the arterial wall.
   Pilarczyk's doctors said the archbishop gave them approval to
use an experimental drug, which they said may have helped save his
life by possibly preventing arterial spasms that can occur even
after surgery. The drug, called nicardipine, relaxes the arterial
wall and prevents spasms, doctors said.
   John M. Tew Jr., a neurosurgeon, used a laser to operate and
seal off the ruptured artery. Tew and the other doctors said they
rerouted the blood supply in the archbishop's brain to prevent a
recurrence of the potentially fatal rupture.
   Pilarczyk, archbishop since 1982 in the 19-county southwestern
Ohio archdiocese, is a native of Dayton. He succeeded Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin as head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese after
Bernardin was elevated to the Chicago Archdiocese by Pope John Paul
II.

<HEAD>Study Shows Ethics Affecting Doctors' Bedside Decisions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are becoming more concerned about ethics
as they face complex health care issues, and that concern is
changing the way decisions are made at the patient's bedside,
studies show.
   Doctors are turning more frequently to ethics committees or
consultants with medical, legal, religious and philosophical
expertise, the Journal of the American Medical Association said.
   While the advice of such groups is not binding, it gives doctors
another perspective.
   ``The physician's decisions must now be justified to patients
and their families, one's colleagues and the courts,'' wrote Dr.
Edmund D. Pellegrino of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics in
Washington in a JAMA editorial.
   ``As a result, every physician ... must know how to use the
advice of ethical consultants wisely and well,'' Pellegrino wrote.
   Friday's journal devoted several articles and an editorial to
the subject of medical ethics. Studies dealt with an ethics
consultation service established at the University of Chicago
Hospitals and Clinics and a doctors' office operated by the
University of Virginia Medical Center.
   Ethical issues are seen in cases such as that of a 55-year-old
woman who requires a machine to breathe and whose family considers
discontinuing her treatment and the case of a 27-year-old man with
a history of drug and alochol abuse who seeks a liver transplant.
   Researchers led by Dr. Julia E. Connelly, of the University of
Virginia's division of general medicine, studied 280 patients who
visited a doctor's office operated by the school in Charlottesville
from November 1983 to July 1984. All the patients _ 212 women and
68 men _ were at least 17 years old.
   The researchers found that 84 of the patients, or 30 percent,
presented ethical problems ranging from the issue of refusing
treatment to issues like confidentiality and the cost of care.
   The Chicago study by Dr. John La Puma, of Lutheran General
Hospital in suburban Park Ridge, discussed a formal ethics
consultation service established at the University of Chicago's
Center for Clinical Medical Ethics in 1986. Members of the service
included doctors with expertise in clinical ethics, clinical ethics
fellows and senior medical students. A hospital attorney and a
philosophy professor served as resources.
   The study reviewed consultation requests over a year and found
that 45 doctors requested consultations for 51 patients. The most
common consultation was for assistance on decisions to forego
life-sustaining treatment, La Puma said.
   In 71 percent of the cases, the doctor found the consultation
``very important'' in patient management, in clarifying ethical
issues or in learning about medical ethics, La Puma said. In 96
percent of the cases, the study found, doctors indicated they
planned to request consultations in the future.
   La Puma said the emphasis on ethics can help clarify medical
issues that may have become lost in a maze of technology.
   ``Bedside ethics is what doctors and patients want and need,''
he said.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian leaders told their countrymen
Thursday that the war with Iraq was not over and urged them to stay
on guard. Each side accused the other of belligerent acts.
   President Ali Khamenei said Iran ``must not trust the deceiving
enemy, therefore we say that the war is apparently, not definitely,
about to end.''
   Both Iran and Iraq have accepted U.N. Resolution 598 calling for
a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. The truce is to go into effect
Aug. 20.
   Tehran radio, in quoting Khamenei's remarks, said he was
speaking at ceremonies in Iran on Thursday where ``people from all
walks of life donated tens of millions of rials in cash and tens of
pieces of gold to assist at the war fronts.''
   The radio was monitored in Nicosia.
   The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Mohsen Rezai, was
quoted on Thursday as saying that ``troops all along the war front
are on full alert.''
   Rezai told the newspaper Kayhan that the state of alert will
continue ``until full implementation of Resolution 598 was
ensured.''
   Iraq on Thursday accused Iran of shelling Iraqi military
positions near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the Persian Gulf
war broke out in September 1980.
   The accusation was in a brief statement issued by the Iraqi
Mission to the United Nations in New York. The report was not
carried on newscasts late Thursday in Iraq.
   According to the statement, ``the Iranian armed forces bombarded
Iraqi military positions of the 3rd Armed Corps Sector'' with
howitzer fire, mortar shells and small missiles. The sector
mentioned is near Iraq's southern port city of Basra.
   Iraqi positions in the 7th Army Corps Sector near the southern
Faw peninsula were also bombarded and tanks fired across the
northern border, the account said.
   Iran gave U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar a
letter pledging it would not launch any attacks in the interim.
   Iraq did not submit a similar letter, but Perez de Cuellar said
Tuesday he had received assurances from both Iran and Iraq that
they would exercise restraint.
   Tehran radio on Wednesday accused Iraqi planes of intruding over
southwest Iran. Iraqi media carried no reports on air force
activity, and there was no independent confirmation of such flights.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, later said
the cease-fire could be jeopardized if Iraqi warplanes continued to
buzz Iranian cities. He lodged a protest with the secretary-general.
   Attempts inside Iraq to confirm the reports of Iranian firing
failed. The official Iraqi news service carried a summary of the
report issued at the United Nations.
   One of the six members of a U.N. team sent to Baghdad to prepare
for the arrival of the full cease-fire observer force said the team
had yet to begin its monitoring work. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The United Nations is to send 350 observers to monitor the
cease-fire.
   Also on Thursday, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran told
Oman's foreign minister, Yusuf Bin Alawi, that nations in the
region should establish positive relations to avoid threats from
foreign powers.
   ``We must expand our relations in all fields,'' he said in a
Tehran radio report. ``As to the security of the Persian Gulf and
Indian Ocean, which can only be provided by the regional countries,
we must go on having exchanges of views.''
   Foreign navies maintain about 60 ships in and around the gulf to
protect neutral shipping from Iranian attacks that grew out of the
gulf war.

<HEAD>Border Patrol Gets High-Performance Cars for Pursuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four high-performance sports cars will be
deployed by the U.S. Border Patrol along the Arizona-Mexico border
in hopes of making high-speed chases shorter, safer and less
frequent, officials said.
   Two Pontiac Trans-Am Formula 350s, a Camero IROC Z-28 and a
special service Ford Mustang soon will be deployed in the Border
Patrol's Tucson Sector, which was chosen to test and evaluate the
high-performance vehicles, said Robert S. Coffin, the sector's
chief deputy patrol officer.
   The four cars, valued at about $60,000, were purchased with
money from the Border Alliance, an interagency group that fights
drug-smuggling along the Mexican border, Coffin said. The cars will
have Border Patrol decals, sirens and flashing lights, he said.
   The cars are to be deployed Aug. 22, according to Ronald Dowdy,
chief patrol agent for the Tucson Sector.
   Dowdy and Coffin said the idea is to make high-speed pursuits
shorter, and therefore safer. The agency also is publicizing the
use of the high-performance cars in hopes of discouraging suspects
from trying to run away, the officials said.
   One advantage of the high-performance cars is faster
acceleration, Dowdy said. He said agents often are parked when
someone speeds past them and catching up can be difficult.
   ``They're going 65 and we're going 0,'' he said.
   Nine officers have been chosen to be part of the pilot program.
They are being sent to a special high-speed driving school first.
``We want them to learn to handle vehicles at high speeds before we
put them out there in these vehicles,'' Coffin said.
   The officers will evaluate the performance of the cars and make
a recommendation to the Border Patrol in about six months. If the
cars are found to be effective, more could be purchased in the
future, Coffin said.
   The Arizona Department of Public Safety began experimenting with
high-performance cars in 1986 with the purchase of 10 Mustangs. The
department now has 20 to 25 such cars on highway patrol duty, and
another 20 are about to be put on highways, said Sgt. Allan
Schmidt, a department spokesman.
   Dowdy said the Border Patrol, which has a fleet of about 200
cars, initially plans to deploy the high-performance vehicles along
Interstates 19 and 10 in southern Arizona.

<HEAD>S&L Capital Loss Slows in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan associations lost capital at
a slower rate in the second quarter, reflecting efforts of federal
regulators to close or bail out insolvent institutions, statistics
released Thursday indicate.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the industry's capital
declined by $1.72 billion in the April-June period, compared with a
drop of $3.51 billion in the first quarter and $4.68 billion in the
last three months of 1987.
   Changes in capital, which is the difference between an
institution's loans and other assets and what it owes to depositors
and other creditors, often reflect profits or losses.
   However, an economist with an industry trade group said S&L
losses likely are not improving as much as the capital figures
would indicate. That is because the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is
closing or rescuing more institutions with negative capital, said
Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings
Institutions.
   ``Looking at these numbers, things are apparently not getting
any worse, but I wouldn't want to go out on a limb and say they've
gotten a whole lot better,'' Regalia said.
   ``But, it's plus in the sense that (regulators) are doing the
right thing. ... This is an indication that the bank board has made
some moves to get rid of bad institutions and that's heartening,''
he said.
   Federally insured S&Ls lost a record $3.81 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1987 and a near-record $3.78 billion in the first three
months of this year. Industrywide profit and loss figures for the
second quarter will not be available until September.
   The bank board also reported that S&L depositors withdrew more
money from their accounts than they deposited in June for the
second consecutive month. Net withdrawal were $2.9 billion in June
after withdrawals of $1.0 billion in May.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, attributed the
deposit shrinkage to normal seasonal factors such as spending on
vacations. Also, he said as stock prices recover some S&L customers
are apparently withdrawing money to buy stock.
   Before May, net deposits grew for seven consecutive months as
investors, battered by the October crash, sought a safe haven in
federally insured savings accounts.
   For the first six months of the year, net deposits were up $12.2
billion, compared with net withdrawals of $15.4 billion in the
first half of 1987.
   Savings institutions closed $24.8 billion in mortgages in June,
up from $21.2 billion in May. However, for the first six months
mortgage lending was down 15.2 percent from the same period last
year.
   Barth said that is because mortgage rates were higher during the
first half of 1988 than a year ago and fewer people are refinancing
their loans.
   Regalia said the expected decline in housing activity later this
year as interest rates increase likely will cut into healthy thrift
institutions' profits.

one, campaign sources said Thursday.
   Sources familiar with Bush's selection process, who spoke only
on the condition of anonymity, said a Bush-Dole ticket showed up as
only marginally stronger than other potential combinations for
which polling was done.
   Dole's advantage ``is a little bit, but not enough to make much
of a difference,'' said one source.
   A ticket of Bush and Bob Dole ran stronger than a hypothetical
ticket of Bush and Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, the sources said.
   Bush's polling, by his chief pollster, Robert Teeter, is all but
complete, suggesting that the vice president will likely make up
his mind in the closely guarded process based on criteria other
than polling, the sources said. Bush has said he will not announce
his choice until the convention.
   The soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee appeared with a
group of black supporters, members of a 100-strong group calling
itself ``Black Americans for Bush,'' and said he would have a
``broad-based'' Cabinet.
   However, he declined to say whether he would name a black to
that Cabinet, a promise he had previously made only to Hispanics.
   Bush also declined to be drawn into a discussion of whether he
was considering Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the first black ever to
hold the post of national security adviser, for the No. 2 spot.
   He said he had ``worked closely with Colin Powell and I have
great respect for him.'' But, he said, ``Don't put it into any vice
presidential equation.''
   Sources said that Bush has not done any polling on Powell and
that he is not under active consideration.
   Those who were contacted earlier by Bush, and asked to provide
financial data, include both Doles, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, and
Sens. Alan Simpson, of Wyoming, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Dan
Quayle of Indiana, according to campaign aides.
   Govs. George Deukmejian of California, Jim Thompson of Illinois,
John Sununu of New Hampshire, Carroll Campbell of South Carolina
and former governor Lamar Alexander of Tennessee were also among
those on the original list of those under consideration, the aides
said. Deukmejian has since withdrawn his name from consideration.
   Bush sources said that polling data indicated that candidates
from small states _ like Simpson _ only helped the ticket
significantly in those states and would have little impact
nationally.
   Simpson, a close friend of Bush, does not expect to be given a
spot on the ticket, a spokesman, Mary Kay Hill, said on Thursday.
   ``I don't think the call will come. I think they'll need to play
Electoral College politics,'' she said.
   She said Simpson and Bush talked about 10 days ago and Simpson
told the vice president ``he did not feel he could help him''
because of some controverisal positions he has taken, including
limits on cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients
and veterans.
   Sources also suggested that no polling had been done on
Domenici, suggesting that he may no longer be under active
consideration.
   Meanwhile, Kemp said he has no expectations that he'll get
picked, and is ``not sitting by the telephone'' waiting to be
asked. But the New York congressman said he would, naturally, jump
at the job.
   ``If I'm asked, I would be happy. If I'm not, I'm going to be
equally happy,'' Kemp said in an interview taped Thursday for the
syndicated television show, McLaughlin's ``One on One.''
   In another development, two Tennessee Republicans mentioned as
vice presidential prospects, Alexander and former Sen. Howard H.
Baker Jr., said they plan only minimal participation in next week's
convention.
   Alexander, now president of the University of Tennessee, will
fly to New Orleans on Sunday to address a meeting of the Republican
governors and return to Nashville that evening. Alexander has said
he would not refuse the No. 2 spot, but most Tennessee Republican
leaders say they do not believe he will be asked.
   Baker, former White House chief of staff, said he is among hosts
for a luncheon Monday in New Orleans honoring first lady Nancy
Reagan and will meet the with Tennessee's congressional delegation.
He will make a brief trip back to Tennessee, then return to New
Orleans on Thursday for a luncheon in honor of his work as Senate
majority leader and of Sen. Bob Dole's work as minority leader.
   In his meeting with black supporters, Bush said that, while he
was aware that most black voters traditionally voted Democratic,
``we have a good shot, we have a chance''
   He said that in his campaign he would demonstrate ``my
commitment in the field of civil rights and in opening the arms of
this party ... I will be a fair-play kind of person.''
   The coalition of blacks supporting Bush includes Joshua Smith,
president of the Maxima Corp., Porcia Scott, editor of the Atlanta
Daily World Newspaper, James Cheek, president of Howard University,
entertainer Lionel Hampton and Larry Brown, former running back for
the Washington Redskins.

<HEAD>USDA Says Soviet Grain Harvest Prospects Decline</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crop Report Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prospects for this year's grain harvest in the
Soviet Union have declined slightly from earlier indications, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said the Soviet harvest is now expected to be around
210 million metric tons, a decline of 5 million tons from the level
forecast in recent months. Yields were said to be smaller than
expected.
   Production of spring-planted grain has been hit hardest,
including spring wheat, oats and barley, the USDA report said. The
output of spring wheat could be the lowest since 1984.
   ``However, this is not expected to result in additional Soviet
wheat imports at this time as smaller supplies of quality wheat
worldwide have sharply driven up prices,'' the report said.
``Instead, as the Soviets are expected to limit any potential
(inventory) stock buildup in 1988-89 and could even draw on stocks
accumulated in recent years if necessary.''
   Part of the reason for the reduction in USDA's estimate was said
to be a smaller-than-expected planted area, as reported by Moscow,
as well as deterioration in spring grain yields.
   Even so, at 210 million tons of grain, the Soviet harvest would
be one of the largest on record. The largest was 237.4 million tons
in 1978.

   Maoist rebels killed six peasants they accused
of aiding the military, officials said Thursday.
   Other guerrillas belonging to a pro-Cuba group exploded a car
bomb shortly before Wednesday midnight at a state mining company
office, slightly wounding three passersby, police reported.
   A column of Maoist Shining Path guerrillas entered Chilete
village in the Andes near Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast of Lima, on
Monday and ordered residents to a central plaza to witness a
``popular trial,'' the military said.
   Six peasants were shot to death after the guerrillas ruled that
they had been government informers and provided support to troops
in the region, the military said.
   The Shining Path has fought Peruvian governments for eight
years. Official figures put the number of dead at 15,000 and the
damage at $10 billion.
   Police said the Lima bombing was the work of the Tupac Amaru
revolutionary movement, which endorses Cuba-style Marxism and has
been active for four years. Its bombings normally occur when few
people are in the vicinity.
   The car bomb exploded at the suburban offices of Centromin, a
state mining company crippled by a 3-week-old miners' strike.
Parcel bombs exploded at the offices of two other mining companies
at about the same time, but police said they caused no casualties
or serious damage.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Many Parts of FBI Agent's Racial Harassment Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday dismissed major
elements of a black FBI agent's racial harassment lawsuit against
the bureau as technically deficient but gave the plaintiff a chance
to file a new complaint.
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey noted that Donald Rochon's
lawsuit contained ``repugnant and chilling'' allegations of racial
harassment by fellow agents.
   But the judge found Rochon's complaint ``contains defects in
both pleading and legal theory that constrain the court to dismiss
many of the plaintiff's claims.''
   Rochon claims he was the victim of a three-year campaign of
harassment by fellow agents in Omaha, Neb., and later Chicago, in
which he received anonymous telephone calls and racist, obscene
letters, including one that threatened him with mutilation and
death and a sexual assault on his white wife.
   Gary W. Miller, a Chicago agent who was kept in the lawsuit by
Richey's order, has admitted he sent Rochon a ``death and
dismemberment'' insurance policy as ``retribution.'' Miller is now
the subject of a federal grand jury investigation in Chicago.
   The suit includes allegations that fellow agents placed
chocolate in the earpiece of his telephone so that it came off onto
his ear when he used the instrument.
   Richey chided some defendants for referring to the incidents in
their pleadings as ``pranks,'' noting that the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission had upheld some of Rochon's claims.
   ``This utter lack of sensitivity is almost as disturbing as the
alleged adts themselves,'' Richey said, warning defendnats that ``a
modicum of decency is expected of all those who file pleadings in
this court.''
   The judge dismissed altogether claims against three agents with
whom Rochon worked in Omaha from 1983 until his transfer to Chicago
in June 1984, ruling the three-year statute of limitations on these
allegations had expired.
   Richey refused to dismiss Rochon's claim against the Justice
Department that as a federal employee he was a victim of
discrimination and racial harassment in violation of Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   But the judge ruled that the 21 FBI agents named in the lawsuit
could not be sued individually under this law. Only the attorney
general, as head of the agency in which Rochon works, can be sued
under this statute, the judge said.
   Richey also ruled that because of the way Rochon's suit was
worded, his complaints of individual harassment by individual
agents were pre-empted by his Title VII claims and therefore could
not be brought under other statutes.
   ``From the imprecisely pleaded complaint, it is difficult to
discern the discrete basis of plaintiff Donald Rochon's common law
tort claims'' against individual agents, Richey said.
   The other counts of the lawsuit ``are not based on distinct
wrongs but are all based upon conduct actionable under Title VII,''
Richey said.
   But the judge's dismissal of these claims ``without prejudice''
leaves Rochon's attorneys the opportunity to draft a new complaint
to try to get around this legal obstacle.
   Despite the ruling, Rochon's attorney, David Kairys of
Philadelphia, said he was happy with the judge's ruling.
   ``He has upheld our ability to get personal damages against the
individual wrongdoers,'' Kairys said.
   Kairys said he would be able to satisfy the technical
requirements for common-law claims against the white agents,
although he conceded this would be more difficult against the FBI
supervisors and managers, whom Rochon claims ignored his complaints.
   Rochon's Title VII claims do not allow him to collect monetary
damages for the alleged racial harassment. To do so, Rochon must
sustain the claims that his constitutional rights were violated in
distinct ways by fellow agents.
   But Richey found that the complaint, as it was worded, allowed
the FBI agents to claim that their actions were not subject to
legal action because they were acting in their official roles as
government agents.
   This includes allegations that Rochon's supervisors refused to
investigate his charges of racial harassment.
   The judge noted that the complaint states that ``all of the
individual defendants with governmental positions acted within the
scope of their employment.''
   ``Given this admission that both the means used and ends sought
by defendants were within the scope of their employment, the court
is constrained from examining the connection between the alleged
acts and bounds of defendants' official duties,'' Richey said.
   ``Under the language of the complaint, these defendants are
entitled to absolute immunity from common law tort liability
arising out of these actions,'' the judge said.
   Claims by Rochon's estranged wife, Susan, also were dismissed
``without prejudice'' because the complaint ``nowhere alleges or
even implies that defendants entered into an agreement of any
kind'' to violate her civil rights.
   The judge refused to dismiss common-law damage claims against
Miller, Thomas Dillon and Kenneth Veach. Rochon claims that all
three white agents orchestrated the harassment against him in
Chicago.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Thursday that
failure to redress the internment of 12,000 Japanese-Canadians
during World War II is a blot on the nation's honor, but he refused
to follow the U.S. example and promise cash compensation.
   Under questioning in Parliament, Mulroney said his Conservative
government was prepared to make a formal apology to
Japanese-Canadians whose goods and property were seized during the
war, and to set up a community fund to fight racism.
   But pressed by opposition Liberal and New Democratic Party
members to match the bill signed this week by President Reagan,
Mulroney made no commitments. The U.S. legislation gives 60,000
surviving Japanese-American internees $20,000 each.
   ``Compensation was not the sticking point,'' Mulroney argued,
noting that former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal
government refused to even consider redress for Japanese-Canadians
interned as wartime security threats.
   Although their homes, fishing boats and belongings were sold
off, the internees were never discovered to have aided Japan or
hurt Canada. Nevertheless, successive governments until now
defended the internment as a necessary wartime precaution.
   Mulroney termed the incident a ``tragedy'' and said discussions
with Japanese-Canadians were making progress. Answering a question,
he said: ``It is a very serious (blot) on Canada's honor.''
   Four successive Cabinet ministers in charge of ethnic minorities
have failed to resolve a compensation claim by the National
Association of Japanese-Canadians. Association president Art Miki
said the current minister, Gerry Weiner, has declined to set a date
for new talks.
   Miki, a high school principal in Winnipeg, told The Associated
Press that passage of the U.S. bill gave Japanese-Canadians renewed
hope.
   ``Everyone you meet in our community was very pleased,'' said
Miki, 51, who was interned as a child. ``The American precedent
certainly strengthens our case.''
   He said the Mulroney government has been trying to treat the
survivors as a group. ``But it's individuals who make up the group.
The American government recognizes those individual rights.''
   Japanese-Canadians have a stronger case since, unlike most of
their American counterparts, they were not allowed to return to
their homes, Miki said.
   Many still live in the prairies where they were interned on
farms, never returning to British Columbia, where the majority
worked in the fishing industry.
   Miki said his group wants $20,500 compensation for each of the
12,000 survivors; a formal apology, and a community project fund of
$41 million instead of the $9.8 million proposed by the government.
   The demands total $287 million. A report commissioned by the
national association said the original 21,000 internees incurred
losses of $363 million in 1986 dollars.
   Miki said most of the survivors are in their 70s and the
mortality rate is about 1,000 a year.
   The Globe and Mail, Canada's national newspaper, said in an
editorial this week that the lack of compensation was ``shameful''
and the government should forget about offering ``piddling sums.''
   There was a small step towards reconciliation last week when the
town of Kaslo, British Columbia, one of the internment sites, held
a two-day event to acknowledge the injustice done to
Japanese-Canadians.
   A plaque unveiled on the occasion said: ``These innocent and
loyal Canadians did not pose a threat to national security but were
victims of racism and political expediency.''

<HEAD>Burnley: Contract Dispute Shouldn't Delay Air Traffic Control
Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temporary suspension of a $3.6 billion
contract with International Business Machines Corp. should not
seriously interfere with the planned modernization of air traffic
control computers, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said
Thursday.
   The General Services Administration's board of appeals ordered
the contract suspended Wednesday after a competitor for the
contract, Hughes Aircraft Co., challenged the awarding of the
project to IBM.
   The appeals board, a semi-judicial body that resolves government
contract disputes, has scheduled 45 days to resolve the matter.
   Both IBM and Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp., had
competed for the $3.6 billion contract to build a new, automated
computer system for the Federal Aviation Administration's air
traffic control operations. The modernization project is to be
completed in the late 1990s.
   The Transporation Department selected IBM over Hughes on July
25. At a news conference announcing the award, officials said IBM
was selected primarily because it submitted a lower bid.
   Burnley told reporters he has ``a lot of confidence that in this
case everything was run by the numbers'' as far as the selection
was concerned.
   He suggested that if the matter was resolved after the 45-day
period, the project would not be adversely affected. ``If that's
all that happens I don't think it will hurt us at all.''
   But Burnley acknowledged ``it would become critical'' if there
were longer delays that would threaten the ability of IBM to hold
together the teams already assembled for the project.
   Meanwhile, Burnley said he was surprised at the decision by
Hughes to protest the contract award because, he said, he had been
assured by General Motors chairman Roger Smith several days after
IBM received the contract that no protest would be filed.
   Hughes Aircraft in its challenge asked that the contract with
IBM be revoked, arguing that the FAA and Transportation Department
had provided IBM unfair advantages.
   Hughes accused the FAA of failing to follow a requirement that
said technical merits were to be given greater weight than price
when awarding the contract.
   Hughes also claimed several irregularities caused its price to
be inflated. For example, Hughes's bid relied on IBM to provide
computer hardware. But, according to Hughes Aircraft, IBM charged
Hughes substantially more for the hardware than what IBM quoted the
FAA for the same items in their separate bid.

<TEXT>
   Swedes opened their annual crawfish
season Thursday with much singing and slurping, but the national
holiday had to be helped with imports from China and Louisiana.
   Much of Sweden's crawfish stock was destroyed by a bacterial
plague beginning in the 1960s. Since then this country of 8.4
million people has become one of the world's biggest importers of
the shellfish, with about 1,800 tons a year.
   The price of the scarce Swedish crawfish hit about $61 for two
pounds, but American imports were readily available at $15 bargains.
   U.S. imports of 1,000 tons this year ended Turkey's previous
dominanation of the market.
   Technically, Thursday is the opening of the fishing season for
the freshwater crustaceans. But traditionally, no one eats even the
imported varieties until Aug. 11.
   The crawfish are boiled in dill and smothered in tradition.
Swedes eat them wearing party hats and bibs. Time-honored rules say
each claw should be downed with a glass of schnapps.
   With an influx of imports from new countries, Swedish newspapers
held gourmet tests to evaluate this year's crop. Judges were
Swedish celebrities, actors or famous chefs.
   Svenska Dagbladet proclaimed an American West Coast variety
named ``California Sunshine'' as the best. ``Fresh and tasty'' with
``beautiful coloring,'' the paper judged. The Chinese jumbo Prino
``looked great but tasted disgusting,'' it said.

   Inspectors working for the Federal Aviation
Administration and other Transportation Department agencies are
being enlisted for the war against illegal drugs, Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley said Thursday.
   Burnley said the more than 4,200 DOT inspectors ``will receive
drug awareness training so they can serve as a new army of `eyes'
in the nation's anti-drug effort.''
   These inspectors are involved in monitoring airlines, trucking
companies, shipping vessels and the railroads.
   Burnley acknowledged that the DOT inspectors have no police
power to interfere in drug trafficking if it is discovered. But he
said they will be told to keep their eyes open for signs of
possible illegal drug activity and notify authorities.
   What might make an aviation inspector suspicious?
   A few items listed by the Transportation Department included:
   Evidence of adhesive tape near registration numbers, showing
possible alteration of the numbers; the presence of sophisticated
navigation instruments on inappropriate aircraft; warped or
misaligned aircraft doors indicating they have been opened in
flight, possibly for air drops; or unusual rivet patterns
indicating that the plane might have been altered to create hiding
places for drugs or extra fuel tanks.

   First Lady Nancy Reagan presented awards to
six American families Thursday and told them, ``Drug enforcement
needs to start in the home.''
   ``We can have police on every corner and in every school, but it
won't make a difference if there's no communication or love at
home,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   For the sixth straight year, Mrs. Reagan presented the Great
American Family awards, sponsored by the American Family Society.
   Chosen by the judges were:
   _Air Force Master Sgt. and Mrs. Timothy M. Dickens and their
children, Dominique, 10, and Daphne, 4, of Las Vegas, Nev.
   _Dennis and Yvonne Eldridge of Walnut Creek, Calif., and their
children, who provide foster care for children born with drug
addiction, AIDS or other terminal illnesses.
   _Mario and Celia Jimenez and their five children, who run a
restaurant in Whitter, Calif., that has grown from a sidewalk taco
stand to a 5,000-square-foot establishment.
   _Mr. and Mrs. Clark Kolterman of Seward, Neb., who have given
foster care to 15 children and adopted two of them as permanent
members of their family.
   _James and Ethel Lee of St. Louis and their two adopted
daughters, Bunny, 17, and Melody, 15, and one natural daughter,
Cecelia, 13, who was born with her parents' hereditary blindness.
   _Katherine Scott-Reid of Moncks Corner, S.C., and her family.
Mrs. Ree department said there were 2.18 million American
farms, continuing a slide that began in 1982 when there were 2.4
million. There has been a decrease every year since then.
   The proportion of farms with sales less than $10,000 dropped
from last year, with the steepest decrease found in the group with
sales of less than $2,500, USDA said. It said farms with sales of
less than $10,000 account for more than half of all farms but less
than 12 percent of land in farms.
   The average size of farms was lower for every economic class
except those with sales of more than $250,000, the department said.
Fewer than 15 percent of all farms have sales of more than $100,000
a year, but they account for more than 50 percent of total farm
land.
   Here is a state-by-state list of the estimated number of farms

<HEAD>Shamir Rejects Annexation; PLO Leaders Arrive In Jordan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel should neither annex the occupied
territories nor include the Palestine Liberation Organization in
discussions of their future, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Thursday.
   PLO officials arrived in Jordan for meetings about King
Hussein's decision last week to give the organization full
responsibility for the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where 1.5 million Palestinians live.
   There have been reports of disagreement among aides to chairman
Yasser Arafat about whether Hussein helped or hurt the PLO by
cutting ties to the territories, where an uprising began Dec. 8.
   Israeli soldiers fired on strone-throwing Palestinians in the
West Bank on Thursday and violent demonstrations were reported in
the Gaza Strip. A young Palestinian was wounded by gunfire.
   Shamir said Israel's enemies were using the rebellion to
undermine its morale.
   ``They have come to the conclusion they can and will attack
Israel's vulnerable points: Israeli morale, Israeli motivation and
Israel's faith in its righteousness,'' he said at a graduation
ceremony of the National Defense College.
   Earlier Thursday, he rejected demands for annexation by
right-wing groups.
   He said the status of the territories could be decided only in
talks with Palestinians not affiliated with the PLO, which Israel
regards as a terrorist organization.
   ``We honor our international obligations and we shall not make
any unilateral step, like imposing Israeli rule on the territories
that are subject to negotiations,'' Shamir said.
   His reference was to the U.S.-mediated Camp David accords
reached by Israel and Egypt in 1978, which call for five years of
autonomy for Palestinians before negotiations on the final status
of land captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Hussein's separation from the occupied lands included laying off
about 21,000 civil servants paid by his government.
   ``Jordan was committed by Arab summit resolutions to certain
obligations toward the West Bank until the land is liberated,''
Arafat aide Khaled Hassan was quoted as saying in an interview
published Thursday in the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat.
   In neighboring Dubai, the newspaper Al-Bayan quoted Salah
Khalaf, anotehr aide to the PLO chief, as saying Hussein's
``courageous decision'' allows the PLO to ``shoulder its
responsibility and take over new political rights.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he would pay the salaries of
former employees of Jordan in the occupied lands, Monte Carlo radio
reported.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said privately it was
``very hypothetical'' whether Israel would allow another Arab
country to send money into the territories.
   Soldiers in the West Bank wounding a 16-year-old Palestinian in
the right leg, officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, Palestinians set tires
ablaze and hurled rocks to protest the death Tuesday of a young
Arab burned to death in a suspected arson attack on a shack where
he was sleeping near Tel Aviv.
   A military court sentenced a Palestinian woman, Munira Daoud, to
eight months in prison for throwing a rock in April at a Jewish
settler guarding hiking Jewish teen-agers in the West Bank village
of Beita.
   The guard, Romam Aldubi, accidentally shot and killed
15-year-old Tirza Porat during the melee, according to an army
investigation.
   The military judge who passed sentence said he took into
consideration that Ms. Daoud's brother was killed in the
confrontation and the army had demolished her home in reprisal,
Israel radio said.
   Jewish settler Pinchas Wallerstein was charged Thursday with
manslaughter in the January shooting death of a Palestinian
teen-ager in Beitin, a West Bank village. Israel radio said the
maximum penalty is 20 years in prison.

<HEAD>U.S. Official, Researcher Differ Over Response to Global Warming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department official and
private-sector research scientist differed sharply Thursday over
whether the nation should begin taking concrete steps to combat the
global warming known as the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Donna Fitzpatrick, associate undersecretary of energy, said more
research was needed before acting to curb production of the
atmospheric gases that scientists say are changing the Earth's
climate.
   ``Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouse
effect _ gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concerns
raised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportable
manner,'' she said.
   ``These scientific uncertainties must be reduced before we
commit the nation's economic future to drastic and potentially
misplaced policy responses,'' Fitzpatrick testified.
   Her statements to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee echoed stands taken previously by Reagan administration
witnesses testifying before congressional hearings on the dangers
posed to mankind by global warming.
   But Stephen Schneider, a climatologist from the National Center
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., testified that ``we
should not use platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse
for inaction. ...
   ``There's a (scientific) concern that we are assaulting the
environment much faster than we are understanding it,'' said
Schneider, characterizing the administration position as
``political value judgments, not scientific opinions.''
   ``More research will certainly put policy making on a firmer
scientific basis ... but it is my opinion that credible details
about specific `winners and losers' will not be available before we
may have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous, large
atmospheric changes,'' said Schneider, who works for a consortium
of universities.
   He and government scientists at the hearing repeated warnings,
which have been made more dramatic by this year's searing
temperatures and drought, that emissions of gases like carbon
dioxide and methane are trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.
   Scientists have not directly linked the summer of 1988 to the
greenhouse effect, but they say the steamy weather and crop losses
are just some of the problems people can expect in the future.
   Greenhouse gases come from a variety of sources, from the
burning of fossil fuels like coal, production of chemicals like
clorofluorocarbons, the escape of huge amounts of methane from rice
paddies and the release of carbon dioxide from the destruction of
forests.
   In congressional hearings, there has been general scientific
agreement that continued emissions of such gases will cause a
destructive rise in temperatures and ocean levels. The differences
occur over when, where and how severe the changes will be.
   Some scientists have warned that even if the world reduced its
production of greenhouse gases, those already in the atmosphere
already will cause the planet in 30 years to 50 years to have its
highest temperatures in 10,000 years.
   Officials from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told Thursday's hearings of
greenhouse research in their agencies.
   They stopped short of seconding Fitzpatrick's stand that nothing
should be done to combat greenhouse gas production until more
scientific certainty is attained.
   Schneider, saying that ``high-leverage actions are long
overdue,'' called for steps that would combat greenhouse gases
while attacking other environmental problems such as acid rain,
low-level ozone pollution and destruction of the stratospheric
ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons.
   He said his first priority would be greater energy efficiency
and conservation to reduce emissions from power plants and
vehicles. No step, he said, should be considered too small because
slowing down the greenhouse effect ``makes good sense.''

<HEAD>Jewish Activist Arrested After Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish activist said Leningrad police detained
him and four other people Thursday after a rally by a Russian
nationalist group that condemns Jews and other ``alien races.''
   Abraham Demin, 29, telephoned The Associated Press and said he
had just been released from a police station to which he was taken
after arriving at a rally of the Pamyat group at the Rumyantsevsky
Garden in downtown Leningrad.
   Demin, who opposes Pamyat's activities, said he was accused of
``agitating,'' beaten and ordered to return to the station on
Friday for sentencing.
   Four other people, some of them who were clearly passersby at
the rally, also were detained, he said.
   Last week, the tabloid Moscow News published letters from
Soviets calling Pamyat racist and fascist. It has chapters in
Moscow and several other large Soviet cities and has held rallies
in Leningrad every Thursday since the end of June.
   One letter quoted a speaker at a rally July 7 as demanding
immediate deportation of Jews and other ``alien races.''
   Demin said about 200 people attended this week's rally, a
five-minute affair that lasted just long enough for Pamyat leaders
to say they were taking a vacation until early September, when the
rallies would resume in a building they did not name.
   He said about 50 police watched the scene.
   On Tuesday, police surrounded the Leningrad home of a prominent
dissident, 28-year-old Alexander Bogdanov, and arrested him for the
third time this year, Demin told the AP. He said Bogdanov He was
accused of disobeying a policeman and sentenced to 15 days in jail.
   Bogdanov had tried to put up anti-Pamyat posters at the group's
rally on Aug. 4, but police prevented him from doing so and later
confiscated the posters, Demin said.

<HEAD>Police Say They Broke a Sex Ring Using Boys Across U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say they've cracked a Tampa-based
child prostitution ring that sold the services of hundreds of boys
as young as 11, sometimes flying the children to meet clients in
distant cities.
   The network operated in several Florida counties and also sent
boys to Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver and Indianapolis,
investigators said.
   Three Florida men were arrested in June, police disclosed
Wednesday, and arrests were expected in other cities.
   Police said they first became aware of the operation when the
parents of an 11-year-old Tampa boy told police they wondered where
their son was getting large sums of cash.
   The man accused of being the ringleader, Wesley David Gonzalez,
26, of Daytona Beach, told authorities the clique used hundreds of
boys as sex slaves for scores of customers, said detective Robert
Sheehan.
   Gonzalez, also known as Michael David Gonzalez, was arrested in
June on charges of capital sexual battery, procuring children under
16 for prostitution and deriving financial support from
prostitution, Sheehan said.
   Gonzalez, an unemployed avionics technician, was being held
without bond at the Hillsborough County Jail.
   The other two men arrested in June were identified as Larry
Gorman, 38, and Michael Leroy Johnson, 30, both of Tampa. Police
said they helped Gonzalez find customers. Johnson was charged with
performing lewd and lascivious acts with a child; Gorman was
charged with performing a sexual act with a child. Both were
released on bond.
   Sheehan said Gonzalez understood the psyche of the boys he
recruited _ most of them runaways or children from poor or broken
homes _ because he was once one of them. He used boys to recruit
others, flashing wads of cash as a lure, according to the detective.
   ``A lot of the kids despised the sex, but the financial
inducements were too enticing to the youngsters,'' said Sheehan.
   Gonzalez told detectives he turned to prostitution when he was
12, taking up pimping when he ``basically became too old,'' Sheehan
said.

<HEAD>American, Soviet Educators Learn Novel Ways To Teach About Each

<TEXT>
   American and Soviet educators are spending
two weeks coping with stereotypes and social policy in an unusual
program aimed at teaching them new ways to tell their students
about each other's countries.
   ``Maybe first I will try them on my family,'' joked Alexander
Mitrofanovich Bannov, principal of a secondary school in
Novosibirsk, about ``believing exercises'' and other methods
outlined at the institute at Hampshire College.
   The two-week program, which began Monday, is sponsored by the
Soviet Academy of Pedagogical Sciences and by Educators for Social
Responsibility, a non-profit organization based in Cambridge.
   Twenty teachers, researchers and administrators from each
country were chosen for the program, which is run in English.
   Bannov, who teaches English in the high school he also
supervises, said he was surprised to find his American counterparts
facing so many of the same problems he faced in trying to reform
his school.
   Among those problems, he said, were ``the evaluation of teachers
and students and staff, and the improving of education. Everybody
says teachers should teach better, as if a child was a pan into
which you could pour information like water.''
   Lawrence Dieringer, associate director of ESR, said that for
teachers in both countries, lessons about each other's country
``are fraught with problems, strong feelings, misinformation,
deeply embedded assumptions and resistance to new information, all
related to tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   Thursday, the participants did a ``believing exercise'' _ a
method of getting students to learn how to understand other
viewpoints by making them defend points of view they disagree with.
   The teachers were asked to make statements supporting the
position that ``there are some crimes so horrible and so abusive
that they demand capital punishment.''
   For many participants, it was impossible to suspend doubts about
the death penalty enough to understand how others could support it.
   ``It is very strange for me to hear about this death penalty,''
said one Soviet woman. ``I can't imagine this institution.''
   Soviet media occasionally report on executions but do not say
how often they occur.
   Just last month, Soviet government radio reported that the state
criminal code was being revised to eliminate the death penalty for
all crimes except premeditated murder. The current code also also
allows death sentences for crimes such as treason and flagrant
corruption.
   Earlier in the week, participants discussed stereotypes each
side believed the other held. The Soviets, for example, said they
thought Americans saw them as aggressors ``trying to take over the
world,'' Dieringer said.
   ``We thought that they thought there was a great disparity
between the rich and poor in our country and that we don't care
about the poor,'' he said.
   ``In many cases there's some kernel of truth in these
stereotypes, but they are so exaggerated and blown out of
proportion ... that they serve to distort and limit our
understanding of each other,'' he said.
   Other topics being discussed are the descriptions of each
other's countries in textbooks and education reform efforts.
   The idea for the teacher exchange was sparked by the 1986 tour
of U.S. cities by Soviet academicians, Dieringer said. The next
institute, on critical thinking, will be held next summer in the
Soviet Union.

   Roman Catholic bishops urged Chile's
military commanders Thursday to avoid a possible deadlock in
October's yes-or-no presidential referendum by choosing a nominee
acceptable to the opposition.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the army commander who has ruled
Chile since a 1973 coup, is expected to be chosen at a meeting Aug.
30 of the army, navy, air force and national police commanders. The
nominee's name will be the only one on the ballot.
   The Rev. Carlos Gonzalez, president of the Episcopal Conference,
told a news conference Thursday ``we are probably headed for a
tie,'' meaning an edge either way of 3 percent of the vote.
Opposition leaders oppose continued rule by Pinochet.
   If the nominee wins a majority, he will begin an eight-year term
in March. If not, an open election will be held in 1990 and
Pinochet will stay in office until then.
   Gonzalez released a statement signed by the conference's leaders
that declared:
   ``Chile is becoming polarized and radicalized. A considerable
number of Chileans feel uncomfortable about the referendum being
called because they fear _ whether a vote of yes or no triumphs _
there exists the danger that the country is headed for a
confrontation.
   ``Many want to see the commanders ... present a candidate who
will preside impartially over the transition to democracy. The
candidate should be the fruit of an accord between the government
and the opposition.''
   The statement did not refer specifically to Pinochet's probable
nomination, but made clear the bishops prefer a less controversial
candidate.
   Pinochet, 72, has rejected previous suggestions that the choice
of a nominee be negotiated and his government has accused church
leaders of meddling in politics.
   Asked for comment on the proposal by Bishop Gonzalez, socialist
Ricardo Lagos told reporters the opposition would accept ``with all
seriousness'' an invitation from the government to negotiate. Lagos
is a leader of the 16-party opposition coalition supporting a
``no'' vote in the referendum.
   Pro-Pinochet leader Eduardo Doberti, however, was quoted by the
government news agency Orbe as saying the idea of a consensus
candidate ``has already been exhausted.'
   No date in October has been announced for the referendum. The
commanders are expected to reveal it along with the the candidate's
name.

   Safety improvements are needed to help prevent
accidents and protect operators at the Department of Energy's five
test and research reactors, the National Academy of Sciences said
Thursday.
   A report issued by the National Research Council, the academy's
operating arm, said ``DOE currently lacks a clear conceptual
framework for addressing safety issues at the reactors.''
   It said that because most of the reactors were designed many
years ago and since have been modified to operate at higher power
levels, ``prevention and mitigation of some potential accidents
rely heavily on the proper and timely response of reactor
operators.''
   ``In extreme cases, operators might have to act in the presence
of radiation or steam in order to prevent releases of radioactive
materials to the environment,'' the report said.
   At a minimum, it said, contractors running the facilities should
provide the capability to operate critical valves from remote
consoles outside the reactor confinements.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said his department welcomed
the academy's safety review, which DOE had requested in May 1986.
It followed an October 1987 report dealing with safety at the
department's weapons production reactors.
   ``The NAS has again presented DOE with a very constructive
analysis of the issues relating to reactor safety. ... The
department has made structural, long-term changes in response to
previous NAS recommendations, and we will continue to do so,''
Herrington said.
   The five DOE test and research reactors examined in the NAS
report are the Advanced Test Reactor and the Experimental Breeder
Reactor II at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho
Falls; the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Federal Nuclear
Reservation near Richland, Wash.; the High Flux Beam Reactor at
Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.; and the High
Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
   The report concluded that safety oversight at the DOE reactors
currently is carried out by ``a fragmented collection of
contractors, operations offices and programmatic divisions in
headquarters.''
   ``The structure tends to disperse responsibility for safety and
seems to require decisions with safety consequences by
organizations that are divorced fro day-to-day safety
responsibility,'' it said.
   The test and research reactors operate at power levels of 60
megawatts to 400 megawatts, compared with the 1,000-megawatt levels
typical for commercial power reactors.
   However, the report cautioned that ``even the smallest of the
test and research reactors contain several million curies of
volatile radionuclides that must be controlled during an accident.''

   Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded the Jewish
Defense League ago and favors deporting all Arabs from Israel, has
given up U.S. citizenship so he can run for re-election to
parliament, his spokesman said Thursday.
   Kahane, born in Brooklyn, successfully fought a U.S. attempt to
strip him of citizenship after he was elected to the Knesset in
1985.
   Spokesman Gad Servetman said Kahane, leader of the Kach Party,
took the action Wednesday in a letter addressed to the U.S. Embassy
in Tel Aviv. The purpose was to circumvent Israeli legislation
prohibiting Israelis who hold dual citizenship from serving in
parliament.
   Servetman said Kahane considered the fact that he might have
trouble re-entering the United States when he gave up his
citizenship.
   ``I know the rabbi was concerned, but as far as I understand, he
can still go to the United States,'' Servetman said.
   Kahane, who founded the Jewish Defense League in 1968, fought to
retain his U.S. passport in 1985 because he believed American
authorities would not grant him visas to enter the country.
   Well-known for his vitriolic tirades, Kahane advocates expelling
all Arabs from Israeli-held territory. Otherwise, he says, Israel
will eventually become an Arab state because the average Arab
family has more children than the average Israeli family.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he's opposed
to higher interest rates but won't criticize the Federal Reserve
for raising a key rate this week.
   ``I think the president has to work closely with the Fed even
though it's independent,'' Bush said in an interview with ABC News'
``Business Week,'' scheduled to be aired Sunday. A transcript of
the taped interview was released Thursday by the network.
   The Fed on Tuesday, claiming it was acting to keep the lid on
inflation, raised its discount rate _ the rate it charges for
short-term loans to its member banks _ to 6.5 percent from 6.0
percent.
   Rises in the bellwether rate usually push up other interest
rates throughout the economy.
   ``I don't want to see interest rates go higher,'' Bush said, but
he added that he didn't want to see inflation soar either.
   ``I can't assault them (the Fed) right now for this,'' Bush
said. ``You find a proper mix.''
   On another subject, Bush broke with the Reagan administration
and said if elected he would support a central recommendation of a
presidentially appointed commission on the Oct 19, 1987, stock
market crash calling for a single regulatory body _ preferably the
Fed _ to oversee financial markets.
   The commission was headed by New York investment banker Nicholas
Brady, a close friend of Bush's whom Reagan selected last week to
succeed James A. Baker III as treasury secretary.
   ``Giving the Fed a greater role in regulation, I think that
makes some sense,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said he would not act to curb corporate takeovers,
claiming that big is not bad. And he said that under a Bush
administration, ``we are not going to be patsies while we're
excluded from foreign markets.''

   Iraq on Thursday accused Iran of firing
hundreds of shells and missiles at Iraqi military positions near
the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the Persian Gulf war broke out
nearly eight years ago.
   A fragile truce had been in place since Monday, when
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that Iran and
Iraq agreed to observe a cease-fire to begin on Aug. 20.
   ``The Iranian armed forces bombarded Iraqi military positions of
the Third Armed Corps Sector'' around Basra with hundreds of
howitzer and mortar shells and dozens of small missiles Wednesday
and Thursday, the Iraqi Mission said in a one-page statement to the
United Nations.
   It said Iran also bombarded Iraqi positions in the Seventh Armed
Corps Sector near the Faw peninsula, site of some of the war's most
ferocious offensives.
   The brief report to the United Nations did not include any
denunciations of Iran. Broadcast news in Iraq late Thursday did not
mention the accusations.
   The reported attacks could not be confirmed. Iran and Iraq both
rarely allow reporters near the war front.
   After Perez de Cuellar announced the Aug. 20 cease-fire date on
Monday, Iran gave him a letter pledging it would not launch any
attacks before that date.
   Iraq did not submit a similar letter, but the secretary-general
said Tuesday he received spoken assurances from both Iran and Iraq
that they would exercise restraint.
   The Iraqi Mission's letter also said an Iranian tank fired two
missiles at Iraqi positions in the ``northern sector.''
   The main attack on Basra involved 214 howitzer projectiles, 205
mortar shells and 32 small missiles, the letter said.
   The Faw bombardment involved 26 howitzer projectiles, 32 mortar
shells and 16 small missiles, it said. Iran also fired three
howitzer and 11 mortar shells at other Iraqi positions in the
Seventh Army Corps sector, it said.
   Basra and the Faw peninsula both are near the Shatt al-Arab, the
southern border between Iran and Iraq. The disputed waterway, which
leads into the Persian Gulf, is Iraq's only sea outlet, but wrecks
in the waterway and Iranian ships in the gulf have blocked it since
early in the war.
   Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 after border skirmishes in a bid to
gain complete control of the waterway.
   In recent months, Iraq recaptured large areas that had been
taken by Iran, including the Faw peninsula and marshland near
Basra. The reverses were seen as one reason Iran decided July 18 to
accept a Security Council cease-fire resolution that Iraq accepted
shortly after it was passed a year ago.
   The U.N. chief met later Thursday with Iraqi Ambassador Ismat
Kittani at Kittani's request.
   Asked later if he delivered a note of protest to the
secretary-general, Kittani replied, ``You assume wrongly. ... I
think our aim is to register with the U.N. a document of facts.''
   His tone was a marked contrast to the rancorous exchanges
between Iranian and Iraqi envoys that were customary up to last
month.
   Iran's envoys to the United Nations were not available for
comment. They left town for preparatory talks before peace talks
with Iraq due to begin Aug. 25 in Geneva, said a receptionist at
the Iranian Mission. She declined to give her name.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati registered a
protest Wednesday with the secretary-general, accusing Iraqi
warplanes of breaking the sound barrier over five Iranian cities in
violations of Iran's airspace.
   Perez de Cuellar said of the alleged overflights: ``I hope it is
something that doesn't mean that the Iraqis intended to break the
cease-fire. I am persuaded that if something happened, it was kind
of a mistake, a technical mistake, a misunderstanding.''
   In a letter to the secretary-general released Thursday,
Mahallati said the Iraqi planes broke the sound barrier over the
Iran cities of Bushehr, Ramhormoz, Masjid Suleiman and Gachsaran,
and invaded Iranian airspace over Piranshahr.
   Also Thursday, the Security Council approved the choice of
Yugoslavian Gen. Slavko Jovic, 58, as head of the U.N. Iran-Iraq
Military Observer Group, which is sending 350 officers from 24
countries to monitor the planned cease-fire.
   Morocco pledged Thursday to donate $2 million to set up the
force.

   Three national polls Thursday said Gov. Michael
Duakis' post-convention surge has crested, but they differed on the
level of backing for Vice President George Bush.
   Two of the surveys found Dukakis retaining a double-digit lead
over his Republican rival, but the third found enough Bush support
to limit Dukakis to a bare six-point advantage. A poll earlier this
week found a seven-point Dukakis lead.
   Dukakis' best showing in the new polls was a 14-point lead in an
NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey conducted Aug. 5-8. That was
down from the 18-point Dukakis lead it found the week after the
Democratic convention.
   Dukakis led by 12 points in a CNN-USA Today poll also done Aug.
5-8. And his numerical lead was only six points _ statistically a
dead heat because of the three-point margin of error _ in a
Business Week poll done Aug. 4-9.
   All three of the polls placed support for Dukakis in the 50
percent range. It was their measures of backing for Bush that
varied, from a low of 36 percent in the NBC-Journal poll to a high
of 45 percent in the Business Week survey.
   A Gallup poll released Tuesday fell within that range, with 49
percent for Dukakis, 42 percent for Bush. Two weeks ago it found
Dukakis up by 17 points.
   Analysts have said Dukakis' 17- or 18-point advantage was a
product of publicity from the Democratic National Convention, which
ended July 20, and was sure to fade, particularly when the
Republicans stage their own convention next week.
   Some expressed surprise at the Gallup poll's suggestion that
Dukakis lost 10 points even before the Republicans met,
particularly since there had been no momentous event to cause such
a decline. As recently as July 31-Aug. 3, a CBS News-New York Times
poll found Dukakis maintaining his lead of 17 points.
   But the new Business Week poll found a similar drop after
putting Dukakis ahead by 18 following the convention. Overall the
three polls Thursday gave a clear indication that Dukakis'
post-convention bounce had peaked. However, they also indicated
that support for Bush was, at least for the moment, unsettled.
   Among other continuing problems for Bush, the NBC-Journal poll
found that the number of respondents rating him unfavorably
remained stubbornly high, while Dukakis did far better on the
favorable-unfavorable scale.
   Dukakis was rated favorably by 54 percent, unfavorably by 24
percent. For Bush it was an even split: 45 percent favorable, 43
percent unfavorable.
   Head-to-head, the NBC-Journal poll found 50 percent support for
Dukakis to 36 percent for Bush. The CNN-USA Today poll put it at
52-40 and the Business Week poll had the race at 51-45.
   While Dukakis' lead in the CNN-USA Today survey was the largest
that poll has found, CNN and USA Today did not poll during the peak
of the Dukakis surge. Their poll before the Democratic convention
found the race at 47 percent for Bush to 44 percent for Dukakis, a
dead heat because of the three-point margin of error. The next
CNN-USA Today poll, conducted during the last two days of the
convention, found Dukakis ahead by 10, 50-40.
   The new NBC-Journal poll was conducted among 1,730 registered
voters, the CNN-USA Today poll among 1,283 registered voters and
the Business Week poll among 1,401 likely voters. All had sampling
errors of plus or minus three points.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis went on the attack Thursday, saying if
he wins the White House there will be ``tough management, not
wishful thinking and blank checks'' for national defense. George
Bush said, ``I'm not gonna tell a soul'' before next week's
Republican convention who his running mate will be.
   Republicans labored in New Orleans to construct a staunchly
conservative platform crafted to Bush's specifications, complete
with a prohibition against higher taxes and abortions.
   ``We've built upon a constructive, conservative platform we had
in 1984, and then expanded it'' by including planks dealing with
drugs, AIDS and education, said Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin,
co-chairman of the drafting committee.
   Three new polls showed Dukakis holding a lead over Bush,
although by less than in the days following last month's Democratic
National Convention. The margins ranged from 14 points in an NBC
News-Wall Street Journal survey conducted Aug. 5-8 to 12 points in
a CNN-USA Today poll conducted Aug. 5-8 to six points in a Business
Week survey conducted Aug. 4-9 _ the last a statistical dead head
because of the three-point plus-or-minus margin of error.
   Dukakis led Bush by 18 points in an NBC survey completed just
after the Democratic convention, but GOP strategists are counting
on their convention beginning next week to give the vice president
a corresponding boost.
   Slowly but surely, the mammoth Superdome was being prepared _
from the 10-story blue curtains that formed a telegenic backdrop
for the podium to the thousands of red, white and blue balloons
being inflated for next week's celebration of Bush's triumph.
   In Washington as in New Orleans, Bush was letting the suspense
build about his choice of a running mate.
   ``There won't be any leaks of this one because I'm not gonna
tell a soul and I haven't so far,'' Bush said in a CBS-TV
interview. He said some stories on the subject are ``close to
accurate and some of 'em are 180 degrees wrong.''
   Bush also said he plays horseshoes and jogs to help relieve the
pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech at next Thursday
night's convention session. ``I'm no William Jennings Bryan and I
think it'll go OK,'' he said in a reference to a renowned orator
who electrified the Democratic National Convention with his
speechmaking at the turn of the century but never won the White
House.
   Private polls conducted for the vice president indicate that
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas would give him more of a boost than any
others in contention for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, but ``not
enough to make much of a difference,'' said one aide.
   Vendors next door to the Superdome hawked lapel buttons pairing
Bush with a variety of running mates, from likely contenders such
as Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp, to the far-far-fetched, like Oliver
North.
   Bush and his wife Barbara joined the president and first lady
Nancy Reagan at the White House for lunch. ``We're going to talk
about how to win,'' the vice president said as he arrived.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said afterward that the
vice president and president would stage a ``brief ceremony''
together at the Belle Chasse Naval Air Station in New Orleans next
Tuesday.
   Reagan had been scheduled to fly to New Orleans on Sunday, speak
to the convention Monday night and then leave Tuesday before Bush's
arrival.
   The seemingly innocuous presidential and vice presidential
comings and goings were fraught with political implications.
   The Bush campaign has relied all year on the vice president's
association with the president to bolster his campaign. Yet the
vice president's advisers also hope to use the convention to have
Bush come out of Reagan's political shadow and emerge as a strong
leader in his own right.
   Dukakis, campaigning in New York and New Jersey to kick off a
five-state swing, lauded Reagan for sealing an arms control
agreement with the Soviet Union, but criticized the
administration's military policy and Pentagon contract scandals.
   He also said Wednesday's increase in the prime lending rate
charged by major banks was ``regrettable, but I think it's what
happens after eight years of borrowing and spending, borrowing and
spending.''
   ``My friends, the test of a successful defense policy isn't how
much money we spend. It's how much security we buy,'' Dukakis said
in a speech at New York University. ``And for the past eight years,
we haven't gotten what we've gone into debt for.''
   ``We have to build strong military forces based on sound
planning and tough management, not wishful thinking and blank
checks,'' he said before heading off for Ft. Dix, N.J., where he
squeezed off a few rifle rounds at a firing range and toured a
C-141 transport plane.
   ``We've got to use those dollars to buy weapons that work,'' he
said. ``And we've got to to manage those dollars to strengthen our
military forces, not to line the pockets of dishonest contractors
and wheeler-dealer consultants.''
   Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska said there was little prospect of a
floor fight at the convention over the lengthy platform document,
despite grumbling from Sen. Lowell Weicker and other dissenters
from some of the planks.

   Republicans finished work on major chunks of
their 1988 platform Thursday, crafting a document that toes the
conservative line on major issue.
   Near the end of the day, they recommended that the party support
reopening a major tax loophole for independent oil and gas
producers, but they defeated a proposal calling for expansion of
AIDS testing to bus drivers and other transportation workers.
   The convention platform committee completed their version of the
document save the defense and foreign policy sections, matters that
Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the committee chairman, said would be
wrapped up Friday morning.
   She said it was unlikely any minority planks would be pressed on
the convention floor next Tuesday.
   The 106-member platform committee, after spirited debates late
Wednesday over AIDS and abortion, turned to less controversial
issues Thursday such as urging schools to teach more geography and
foreign languages.
   But late Thursday, another bitter dispute over AIDS broke out.
   Porter Davis of Oklahoma proposed a plank calling for testing of
transportation personnel for the deadly disease.
   ``When you travel around New Orleans, you will take taxis and
buses,'' he said. ``When you go home, you will take planes and rely
on pilots and mechanics.''
   ``This is overkill,'' retorted Rep. Guy Molinari of New York.
``My God, we won't be able to get out of New Orleans if we adopted
this.''
   ``Fellow delegates, let's come to our senses. ... Why pick on
these people?'' said Bill Graham of North Carolina.
   The amendment was defeated without a formal vote tally.
   Earlier, the committee added language supporting efforts to
expand drug testing of transportation workers.
   A potential fight over apartheid was averted as Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. of Connecticut left town before the committee took up
the foreign policy plank. Weicker, who returned to Washington to
attend to Senate business, shelved plans to press an amendment
calling upon the GOP to back tough economic sanctions against South
Africa.
   Before leaving, Weicker got Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin,
co-chairman of the committee, to press for adoption of another
Weicker amendment backing a merger of the Environmental Protection
Agency and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration _ but not as a Cabinet-level Department of the
Enviornment, as Weicker originally sought.
   The amendment was adopted later without dissent.
   Another approved amendment calls for reopening a major tax break
for oil and gas producers. Currently, ``intangible drilling costs''
can greatly reduce an independent producer's taxes. But the
so-called alternative minimum tax can wipe out much of that
benefit, by forcing the producers to forego the deduction _ a
change made in the 1986 tax law.
   The platform plank calls for reversing that provision, in effect
reopening the loophole that was estimated in 1986 to cost the
Treasury up to $1 billion a year.
   The change, sponsored by Rick Montoya of New Mexico, was
approved by a voice vote.
   Charles Black, a Bush campaign liaison to the committee, told
reporters that the draft platform shows that ``George Bush is
running as a conservative, running on the policies (conservatives)
have promoted through Ronald Reagan over these eight years.''
   ``We have an opponent who is running from issues, who has
stipulated he's not running on issues, but on competence or some
kind of personal characteristics. So it's very important for George
Bush to have a platform that goes into detail on where we want to
take the country,'' Black said.
   The most hotly contested issue was Wednesday's 55-32 vote not to
change a line in the anti-abortion plank that declares: ``We
believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life
which cannot be infringed.''
   Marjorie Bell Chambers of Los Alamos, N.M., who tried to strike
the last four words, said Thursday she would not seek to gather the
27 signatures needed to press a minority plank on that issue.
   She said she ``did not want to cause problems for the Bush
campaign with a floor fight'' even though she said the language
``smacks of some fanaticism.''
   By voice, the delegates on Wednesday also rejected an amendment
to allow Medicaid funding of abortion in cases of rape or incest,
and they refused to expand an AIDS plank to endorse all the
recommendations of a presidential commission.
   Black said Bush has endorsed the commission's call for
legislation to protect the rights of AIDS patients, but not the
entire report. President Reagan did not support the commission's
call for new anti-discrimination legislation.
   Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of the platform
committee, said GOP moderates got a chance to air their arguments
and ``made a clear impact on the platform'' in such areas as
committing the GOP to work toward catastrophic health care for
children _ a Weicker proposal that passed 53-30 Wednesday after the
senator assured delegates ``there would be no financial
commitment.''
   On other issues, Kasten said, ``they had clear opportunities and
they were defeated.'' Like Orr, Kasten said he does not expect any
minority planks.
   ``No one felt that their rights were trampled on,'' Kasten said.
   The delegates approved an amendment urging local school
districts to ``recognize the value of kindergarten and
pre-kindergarten programs.''
   That language irked some conservative delegates.
   Bunny Chambers of Oklahoma City said, ``We need to keep our
children in the home, with their mothers.'' Marylin Shannon of
Salem, Ore., said, ``I can't imagine Republicans wanting to saddle
public schools with the day care business.''

<TEXT>
   A virus that has killed thousands of harbor
seals in North Sea coastal waters also is affecting gray seals,
Swedish researchers said Thursday.
   An emaciated female gray seal at least 20 years old was found
dead last Sunday at Sibbarp, south of Malmo on Sweden's southwest
coast.
   Swedish experts said an autopsy showed the same lung damage as
in the harbor seals. They said another dead gray seal found later
near Ystad, farther south, has yet to be examined.
   ``The pneumonia suffered by this animal, which I judged had been
dead about 24 hours, is characteristic,'' said Dr. Anders Bergman,
the Uppsala veterinarian who performed the autopsy. ``We still hold
a hope however that various individuals of gray seals are more or
less resistant.
   ``It would seem to be the same type of virus. ... If we get in a
young one too, I am afraid we have a new disaster on our hands.
There is an obvious risk it will also spread to the third species
in our waters, the ringed seal.'' A similar gray seal case was
found in Denmark and researchers said material for comparison was
being sent to Sweden.
   Gray seals in the Baltic Sea and Bothnian Gulf are believed to
number 1,000-2,000, but only a few remain in the south Baltic
because of increasing chemical pollution of the waters.

<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica said
Thursday that he had spoken ``with my heart in my hand'' in asking
Cuban President Fidel Castro for help in bringing peace to Central
America.
   Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his efforts
to halt Central America's violence, met Castro for 1{ hours
Wednesday.
   They were among seven Latin American leaders in Quito for the
inauguration of President Rodrigo Borja, a moderate leftist who
pledged a non-aligned foreign policy. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz represented the United States.
   Arias said he urged Castro to use his influence with Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista leaders to persuade them to keep their promises
for more freedom in Nicaragua, including releasing political
prisoners and lifting censorship of the news media.
   Arias told a news conference that to achieve peace in Central
America, ``the support and effort of many people are needed, and
Fidel Castro is one of them.''
   He said he told Castro that Castro ``had a very important role
to play if we want to achieve peace in the region.''
   ``I have spoken to him with my heart in my hand because I
believe that there are 27 million human beings in Central America
who desire and deserve to live in peace,'' Arias said.
   In Latin America, the phrase ``heart in hand'' means to speak
very sincerely, to be very candid, regardless of possible
consequences.
   Arias said ``nothing concrete'' was achieved in the meeting. He
said he regretted not having more time to talk with the leader of
communist Cuba and hoped to be able to meet again with him soon.
   Except for Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, the visiting
presidents returned home Wednesday night or Thursday.
   Ortega arrived Thursday after Borja renewed diplomatic ties
between Ecuador and Nicaragua that were cut in 1985 by former
President Leon Febres Cordero, an archconservative.

   Much of the nation broiled under 90-degree weather Thursday,
with the East enduring high humidity as well. Remnants of tropical
storm Beryl soaked the Louisiana and Texas coasts.
   The temperature in Philadelphia climbed to 90 degrees Thursday
afternoon for the 44th time this summer. The summer of 1983 held
the previous record with 41 days of 90 degrees or higher in 110
years of recorded weather history.
   The oppressive heat and humidity stretched from southern New
England to Maryland and over much of Indiana and Illinois. The heat
brought pleas from an Albany, N.Y., utility for customers to cut
back their electricity use to avoid blackouts.
   Six inches of rain fell Thursday at Cushing, Texas, and 2 to 4
inches of rain fell in parts of northwest Louisiana Thursday
morning. Flash flood warnings were posted in northeast Texas.
   In the Houston area, thunderstorms produced heavy rain early
Thursday afternoon. Over an inch of rain fell in the northern part
of Harris County and street flooding was reported.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the
south Atlantic coastal states across the central and southern
Appalachians to the Great Lakes region. Scattered showers also
developed over New England.
   Lightning struck and killed a boater in northwest Minnesota. In
Wisconsin, wind gusts to 50 mph and pea-size hail was reported at
Ripon in the east-central part of the state. Thunderstorm winds
downed trees at Eden, Wis.
   Thunderstorms developed around midday in northwest Arizona and
southwest Utah. Thunderstorm gusts reached 63 mph at Milford, Utah.
   Skies were mostly sunny Thursday afternoon over the northern and
central Plains. Temperatures reached over 100 degrees in portions
of South Dakota.
   Skies were sunny in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures
were on the pleasant side. It was 65 degrees in Seattle at noon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 104 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.,
and Phoeniz, Ariz. Thursday's low in the nation was 35 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Record-high temperatures were set in Beckley, W. Va., 88;
Binghamton, N.Y., 87; Buffalo, N.Y., 92; and Bridgeport, Conn., 92.
   Friday's forecast was for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the Gulf Coast northward to eastern Kansas, southern Missouri,
the Ohio Valley and eastern portions of the Great Lakes region.
   Showers and thunderstorms were predicted for southwest Missouri,
eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast for portions of New England and the New
York City area. Widely scattered thunderstorms were also expected
to develop from the northern Great Lakes to North Dakota, and from
the Rockies to the mountains of Arizona.
   High temperatures were forecast in the upper 80s and 90s across
most of the nation; in the lower 80s from northern Michigan to
northern Minnesota; in the 70s and low 80s over the Pacific
Northwest and along the Pacific Coast. Temperatures between 95 and
110 degrees were predicted for the Dakotas and in the desert
Southwest.

   A Roman Catholic youth gunned
down by Protestant guerrillas and a British soldier killed by an
IRA bomb were buried Thursday, both victims of Northern Ireland's
sectarian violence.
   A funeral was held here for Seamus Morris, 18, one of two men
fatally shot Monday in north Belfast. The Protestant Action Force,
a paramilitary group, claimed responsibility for the deaths.
   Bishop Cahal Daly, Roman Catholic bishop of Down and Connor,
said in remarks at Morris' funeral that all Catholics in Northern
Ireland are now potential targets for paramilitary killers.
   ``Any Catholic at random in a Catholic street is a target,''
Daly said. ``Any member of the public happening to be at business
in a Catholic street at the time is a potential victim.
   ``It is a matter of great urgency that better protection be
provided by the security authorities for exposed Catholic
enclaves.''
   Morris, a student, and Peter Dolan, a 25-year-old beer
deliveryman who was buried Wednesday, were shot by gunmen who drove
into the Catholic Ardoyne area of north Belfast. They were killed
in broad daylight in a shopping district.
   Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's legal political front,
has rejected suggestions that the killings were in retaliation for
a renewed IRA campaign against British targets that killed six
people last week.
   In London, a British army soldier killed Aug. 1 in an IRA
bombing was buried Thursday with full military honors and amid
tight security.
   Lance Cpl. Mickey Robbins' funeral was held in a military chapel
just 200 yards from where the bomb exploded in the Inglis Barracks
in north London. The funeal was guarded by soldiers armed with
machine guns who checked all mourners and even searched the cars of
senior army officers attending.
   Robbins' commander, Col. Peter Westcott, praised the 23-year-old
soldier ``who was deliberately murdered by terrorists whilst
sleeping peacefully in his bed.''
   The IRA wants to oust Britain from the predominantly Protestant
province of Northern Ireland and unite it with the Catholic Irish
Republic.

   China's Communist Party, which has 47 million
members, expelled or forced the resignation of 109,000 members last
year in a drive to clean up the party's sullied reputation, it was
reported Thursday.
   An official of the party's Organization Department, in an
interview with the state-run Xinhua News Agency, said 20,000 party
members were expelled. Xinhua said in its report that the number
included 30 senior officials ranked higher than the prefectural, or
state, level.
   It said the number of removals was the largest in recent years,
and showed the party's determination to root out corruption.
   The report noted that party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang
earlier this year said those who abuse their powers and extort
money, embezzle and betray the nation's interests must be
mercilessly removed from the party.
   Xinhua said most of those expelled were involved in smuggling,
bribery, embezzlement or violations concerning foreign affairs or
foreign nationals.
   The party's Discipline Inspection Commission, responding to
widespread complaints about corruption among party officials,
recently has issued regulations on the business dealings of party
officials.
   Xinhua claimed the party continued to enjoy high prestige among
the Chinese people. It said more than 8 million people applied to
join last year.

   French opera director and set
designer Jean-Pierre Ponnelle died Thursday at the age of 56.
   Ponnelle died in a hospital in Munich, where he has a home, said
a friend of the family. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   He worked as a set designer and director at the Paris Opera,
collaborating with some of the biggest names in music, including
Herbert von Karajan, Karl Boehm, Claudio Abbado, Seiji Ozawa and
Daniel Barenboim.
   Ponnelle was scheduled to supervise the staging of ``The
Marriage of Figaro'' and ``Moses and Aron'' at the Salzburg
Festival, where he had word for 20 years, but he was forced to cut
short his participation this year, according to the festival's
press office.
   His last Paris production was Mozart's ``The Magic Flute''
performed at the Champs Elysee Theatre.
   Born Feb. 19, 1932, in Paris, Ponnelle studied music, history
and art and spend part of his childhood in Baden-Baden, in West
Germany.
   Ponnelle worked first as a set designer before making his
directorial debut in 1962 with Richard Wagner's ``Tristan and
Isolde'' in Dusseldorf.
   During the 1960s, Ponnelle worked at the world's premier opera
houses, from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to La Scala in
Milan and from Covent Garden in London to the Vienna Opera.
   In 1975, Ponnelle also worked extensively on opera films,
including ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``Madame Butterfly,''
``Rigoletto'' and, with Boehm, on ``The Marriage of Figaro.''
   Ponnelle is survived by his wife, German actress and director
Margit Saad, and a son.

   South African Consul Dirk de Wet
and three of his countrymen were ordered expelled Thursday by the
Foreign Ministry for violating visa conditions.
   The three men _ Germt Olivier, Ismail Richards and Bennet Ndlazi
_ applied for visas to visit Argentina for talks with the consul,
according to the government news agency Telam. Instead, they
participated in a public seminar organized by the consulate, it
said.
   The topic of the seminar was not disclosed.
   Argentina in 1986 lowered the level of its diplomatic relations
with South Africa from embassy status to a consulate because of
apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese on Thursday
criticized two of his former top aides, who resigned their
positions and offered embarassing congressional testimony about the
outgoing attorney general.
   Meese's lawyers struck back at Arnold I. Burns and William F.
Weld in a 69-page statement filed with the Senate Judiciary
Committee _ where both men testified July 26.
   Attorneys Nathan Lewin and James E. Rocap III said their
statement was issued on behalf of Meese, whose ethical conduct was
investigated by Independent Counsel James McKay.
   McKay concluded Meese ``probably'' broke two tax laws and twice
violated a federal conflict-of-interest statute _ but he declined
to prosecute the attorney general.
   Weld, who resigned March 29 as chief of the criminal division,
told the committee that he resigned in protest after telling Meese
he had probably broken the law.
   Weld's conclusion was ``shocking and wrong,'' the rebuttal
statement said, because it was premised on statements containing
``distortions, inaccuracies and material omissions that completely
undermine his opinion.''
   And Burns _ ranked second to Meese as deputy attorney general _
testified he quit at the same time because of a ``deep malaise'' at
the department. He described Meese as living in ``a world of Alice
in Wonderland'' about his problems.
   The rebuttal statement mainly addressed Weld's testimony that if
Meese were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been
prosecuted for taking gratuities from his longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach.
   The statement said McKay ``concluded that Mr. Meese was telling
the truth when he denied that any alleged benefits given to him by
Mr. Wallach were provided on account of any offiical actions.
   ``Mr. Weld neither heard the testimony nor read the grand jury
transcript. How can he in good faith assert publicly that there had
been a criminal violation of federal law without considering the
most direct and compelling evidence of Mr. Meese's state of mind _
his own sworn testimony in answer to the prosecutor's questions.''
   The statement said Burns' testimony about low department morale
was ``fully and convincingly repudiated'' by the acting
replacements for Burns and Weld, and a third department official.
   The three are Harold Christensen, acting deputy attorney
general; Francis A. Keating II, acting associate attorney general;
and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. acting chief of the criminal division.
   ``Nothing of substance remains of Mr. Burns' testimony,'' the
statement said. ``His Alice in Wonderland metaphor had a 12-hour
life; it was broadcast on the evening and morning network news.''

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Proposed Audi Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed settlement in a class-action lawsuit
that contended Audi 5000 sedans were defective and subject to
sudden accelerationed was thrown out Thursday by a judge.
   The proposed settlement offered rebates of $300 to $2,000 to
390,000 current or former owners who buy another Audi. Under the
settlement, Audi would acknowledge no liability.
   ``It puts people in a position where they have to buy an Audi to
reap any benefit,'' said Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowski.
``Clearly, it's a settlement that I couldn't live with.''
   Rakowski recommended that both sides try to negotiate another
settlement and he set another hearing for Aug. 31, officials said.
   Rakowski's action vacates an earlier order by another judge who
gave preliminary approval to the settlement before removing himself
from the case due to a conflict of interest.
   The case stems from a 1987 class-action lawsuit filed by a group
of Audi owners alleging the Audi 5000s with automatic transmissions
were defective because of sudden acceleration problems. The
settlement would have applied to owners of Audi 5000s built between
1978 and 1986.
   Thursday's ruling was praised by attorney Stephen Nassau, who
represents the Washington-based Audi Victims Network, a group of
Audi owners who contend their cars had sudden acceleration
problems. The group opposed the settlement.
   Joseph Bennett, national spokesman for Audi of America Inc.
based in Troy, Mich., said the automaker was disappointed by
Rakowski's decision.
   ``We're disappointed because better than 99{ percent of the Audi
owners out there apparently felt that (the settlement) was quite
fair,'' said Bennett, referring to the response to settlement
notices sent to Audi owners.
   Bennett said Audi had not decided whether to seek another
settlement or let the lawsuit go to trial.
   Circuit Judge Harold Siegan had given preliminary approval to
the settlement, but removed himself in July because of his
friendship with an attorney in the case.
   Siegan said he hadn't taken any evidence and said he thought
that his order should be vacated by the new judge, according to a
motion filed by Nassau.
   The Center for Auto Safety contends that at least 16,50
accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths, have been linked
to acceleration surges when an Audi 5000 was shifted from into gear
from park.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Roman Catholic bishops on Thursday
strongly protested the expulsion of a Canadian priest and accused
the military government of random killings, saying ``human life has
no value'' here.
   The statement, broadcast on Catholic Radio-Soleil, was the first
general comment on conditions in Haiti by the largely conservative
church leadership since Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy seized power on June
19.
   In a declaration signed by the two archbishops and the eight
bishops of Haiti, the Catholic Episcopal Conference specifically
protested the government's Aug. 5 ouster of Rev. Rene Poirier, a
parish priest.
   The declaration came one day after soldiers broke up a prayer
vigil for Poirier by about 500 Catholics and arrested five people
standing guard outside a church where the vigil took place.
   Poirier, who belonged to an activist wing of the church that
openly opposes the military government, was arrested and expelled
after he refused to give police the names of parishioners. The
government accused Poirier of disturbing ``social and political
order.''
   ``In the name of the right and dignity of all human beings, in
the name of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we vigorously protest
against the way Father Poirier was expelled,'' the bishops said.
   The declaration denounced the Namphy government for the coup
that ended four months of government by civilian President Leslie
Manigat, and for suspending Haiti's constitution on July 8.
   ``On June 19, the Haitian army seized power,'' the statement
said. ``It crushed the constitution, although it had pledged to
respect that constitution.''
   The bishops also accused the military of widespread human rights
violations before and after the coup, saying that ``human life has
no value in the country. People are killed here and there.''
   They cited the death of human rights leader Lafontant Joseph,
who was found slain July 11; the pillaging of the remote northern
village of Danti in May; and the attack on a Catholic presbytery at
Fonds Varette last month.

   An oil barge struck a sunken barge early
Thursday, spilling more than 2,000 gallons of oil into the water
off the Mississippi coast before the leak was stopped, officials
said.
   Authorities were watching the movement of a two-mile oil slick
threatening barrier island beaches.
   ``The slick is tending to break up and it may not impact the
islands or the Mississippi coastline,'' said Eleana Turner of the
Mississippi Bureau of Pollution Control. ``The sun is evaporating a
lot of the oil, so things are looking pretty good.''
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said late Thursday that
inspections showed the oil slick to be very light crude.
   ``Right now, based on the consistency of the oil and the
resources available, things are pretty much under control,''
Morehead said. ``If things stay the same, it looks like it's going
to reach the islands.''
   Cmdr. Donald Stansell of the Coast Guard's Mobile, Ala., office,
said an estimated 2,000 gallons of oil had spilled during the first
few hours after the barge was ruptured about 4:25 a.m. Thursday.
   Equipment was dispatched to remove as much oil as possible from
the water. Officials fear the slick could reach the popular beaches
of Cat or Ship islands, about 10 miles offshore, said Coast Guard
Capt. William Loefstedt.
   ``We hope to prevent damage if possible,'' he said. ``But things
change if the wind comes up and the direction of the oil slick
changes.''
   The barge was owned by Tenn-Tom Towing of Mobile, Ala., and was
being towed to a refinery in Louisiana, said Stansell. Stansell
said the amount of oil spilled so far classified the accident as
relatively minor.
   The accident occurred when the barge scraped over the top of a
barge laden with scrap iron that had sunk earlier in the week when
Tropical Storm Beryl hit, Loefstedt said. The accident occurred
near the Gulfport ship channel, between the coast and the barrier
islands.
   The damaged tanks on the oil barge held 8,600 barrels of oil, or
more than 270,900 gallons.
   Thursday afternoon, Turner said the oil barge had been lifted
off the submerged barge without any significant increase in the
amount of leaking crude.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators lugged
crosses and picket signs to the gates of Universal Studios on
Thursday to protest ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' on the eve of
the film's release.
   In Washington, the conservative religious lobby Moral Majority
condemned the Martin Scorsese-directed film as ``an utter
blasphemy'' and pledged a boycott of Universal, the movie's
distributor and related companies.
   The movie, which opens Friday in seven U.S. cities and Toronto,
stars Willem Dafoe, Barbara Hershey and Harvey Keitel. Based on the
1955 novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, it differs with the Biblical
account of Jesus' life.
   The fundamentalists' fury has focused on Scorsese's portrayal of
Jesus as an uncertain, ambivalent savior. In a hallucinatory dream
sequence while dying on the cross, Scorsese's Christ imagines
abandoning his divinity to live as an ordinary mortal, and
fantasizes about sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Scorsese has defended his film, saying it is intended as a
thought-provoking work of art derived from a novel that focuses on
the humanity of Jesus and the worldly temptations he faced.
   In London, a Roman Catholic official called Thursday for viewers
to boycott the film.
   ``People ought to show a bit of restraint and not give in to
curiosity,'' said Nicholas Coote, assistant general secretary of
the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales. ``Can we just for once
not wallow in bad taste?''
   A spokesman for the Church of England, John Miles, said the
church's Board of Social Responsibility will want to see the film,
but until it did, the church could not comment.
   Police said a crowd of 25,000 joined the Hollywood protest,
coordinated by the American Family Association, Trinity Broadcast
Network and other conservative Christians. It caused huge traffic
jams around Universal Studios.
   Joyce Walker, 34, said she came to the demonstration at the
direction of the PTL Television ministry. ``I may go see the
movie,'' Ms. Walker said. ``I'm still curious, but I don't like the
sex scenes with Jesus.''
   Among participants in the noon demonstration were Rev. Donald
Wildmon, director of the American Family Association of Tupelo,
Miss., and Bill Bright, president of the Campus Crusade for Christ
in Arrowhead Springs, Calif.
   ``We have come to tell this company that although you may not
respect our religion, you will respect us in the marketplace,''
Wildmon told the crowd.
   Bright and Wildmon have emerged as prominent critics of the
film. Bright has offered to raise $10 million to buy and burn the
film, and Wildmon has urged a nationwide boycott of MCA.
   Moral Majority president Jerry C. Nims said in a statement from
his Washington office that he was calling for a nationwide boycott
of Universal Pictures and other subsidiaries of MCA Inc.,
Universal's parent company.
   ``Regardless of what this movie claims to be, `The Last
Temptation of Christ' appears to be utter blasphemy,'' Nims said in
a letter to MCA chairman Lew Wasserman, accusing MCA and its
officials of ``privately and personally profiting from the
blaspheming of our Saviour.''
   Nims said the boycott also would apply to Xerox Corp. and Pepsi
Co. because some members of their boards of directors also serve on
MCA's board. Nims' spokesman, Jake Hansen, said the Moral Majority
leader has not seen the movie.
   Conservative Reps. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., Robert K.
Dornan, R-Calif., and Clyde Holloway, R-La., added their
denunciations late Wednesday in Congress, calling the movie
``scurrilous'' and ``blasphemous.''
   While it has been difficult to assess the economic effect of the
MCA boycott, several theater chains have decided against showing
the film, including the huge General Cinema Theaters based in
Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' is scheduled to open to the
public Friday in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, San Francisco,
Seattle, Minneapolis, New York City and Toronto.

<HEAD>Team Specializing in Unruly Wildfires Called in to Control
Yellowstone Blaze</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with fire in Utah, Yellowstone road

   A team trained in handling unruly wildfires was brought in
Thursday to battle a nearly 37,000-acre fire burning in Wyoming's
Yellowstone National Park, while Oregon firefighters finally
contained the state's largest blaze of the year.
   Fires also burned in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah and California.
   In Wyoming, Yellowstone's 36,910-acre North Fork fire burned 1{
miles south of a campground and a new finger of flame made a run
east into the backcountry, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   Park officials closed a road leading to the Old Faithful geyser
because of fire and smoke from the blaze. Old Faithful could still
be reached from the south, she said.
   Anzelmo said Thursday the presence of the high-level fire
management team was not an indication that officials were worried
that the fire, which had remained stable for several days, could
get out of hand again.
   ``Different strategies are used for different fires and
different types of crews are used for those strategies,'' she said.
   More crews were to be brought in later Thursday to supplement
the 600 firefighters battling the North Fork blaze, the most active
of a number of fires burning on about 196,000 acres of Yellowstone.
   Crews in Idaho mopped up hotspots on two contained wildfires as
fire bosses braced for a new assault of thunderstorms and lightning
that could ignite another round of backcountry fires.
   Prospects for containment by day's end of the stubborn
1,500-acre Spring Canyon II fire on the Targhee National Forest
near the Wyoming border improved as the 10-mile containment line
held despite gusting winds. Crews and equipment were being
demobilized from the 1,000-acre Ruby Rapids fire in the Nez Perce
National Forest near Riggins after the blaze was contained late
Wednesday.
   In the Challis National Forest in central Idaho, crews continued
carving a break line between the month-old 13,000-acre Battleaxe
wilderness fire and a guard station and private airstrip about a
mile south. The area was closed Wednesday as firefighters kept the
flames from jumping a creek and threatening the structure and
airstrip.
   Oregon firefighters got the upper hand of the week-old Paulina
fire that has blackened an estimated 13,000 acres of the Deshutes
National Forest.
   The fire, about 25 miles southeast of Bend, had threatened two
small resorts in the Newberry Crater area before being contained.
Some 400 of the 1,400 firefighters and support personnel assigned
to the blaze were sent home Thursday, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Carol Tocco.
   Storms that brought high winds but little rain drove the Warm
Springs Creek fire in southwestern Montana into steeper terrain and
denser timber overnight, tripling its size to 2,500 acres of the
Helena National Forest.
   A 1,800-acre brush fire in the western hills of Carson City,
Nevada's capital, was contained Thursday, one day after it was
fanned into a 50-foot-high wall of flame near many homes. About 200
people were briefly evacuated, and no structures were damaged.
   Elsewhere in the state, a 700-acre brush fire burning in a
remote area of northwestern Elko County was declared 60 percent
contained. A prairie fire north of Scottsbluff burned at least 18
square miles of pasture and grassland in the Panhandle on Thursday
before it was brought under control.
   In California, a wildfire pushed by strong, erratic winds was
burning out of control Thursday in the Sequoia National Forest,
blackening 2,000 acres, destroying two cabins and threatening
others, authorities said.
   More than 350 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze in the
steep, mountainous region, 35 miles northeast of Bakersfield. At
least 1,000 more firefighters would be sent during the night,
authorities said.
   Elsewhere in California, the U.S. Forest Service had no
estimated containment time for a fire in the Susanville area that
has charred an estimated 2,000 acres of rough terrain in the
Shelton National Refuge.
   The fire is the largest of 41 lightning-caused blazes that broke
out Wednesday when more than 840 strikes hit the ground, said
forest service spokesman Dave Reider.
   A 200-acre brush fire roared out of control Thursday afternoon
and damaged two homes in Morongo Valley, about 60 miles east of Los
Angeles. A fire investigator made an arson arrest, but details were
not available.
   In Park City, Utah, firefighters contained a 300- to 400-acre
canyon brush fire which started Thursday afternoon when a burning
auto pulled off a road and ignited dry grass, a fire spokeswoman
said.

   A former Agency for International Development
financial officer on Thursday admitted embezzling $1.2 million from
the government and agreed to forfeit the house, cars and luxury
items he bought with the money.
   William J. Burns, 48, entered guilty pleas to felony charges of
embezzlement, filing false claims and attempted tax evasion before
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. She set sentencing for
Oct. 11.
   Burns admitted that during a six-year period starting in 1982,
he signed false forms authorizing the Treasury Department to pay
travel reimbursement checks to a fictitious individual named
Vincent Kauffman, for whom Burns opened a bank account.
   Burns, who earned $35,108 a year as a financial manager for the
foreign aid agency, transferred the money to his own bank account
by writing checks to himself and signing Kauffman's name.
   The money was used to purchase ``a house, car, furs, trips,
jewels and other personal luxury items for Mr. Burns and his
family,'' Justice Department prosecutor James Cole said.
   The judge reminded Burns that he could receive a 20-year
sentence for the three convictions and fined up to $500,000.
   But prosecutors said that according to sentencing guidelines
implemented last year, Burns could be sentenced to a term of 2{
years to three years and one month without parole.
   According to the plea agreement, Burns or federal prosecutors
could withdraw from the deal if the probation department calculates
a different sentence under the guidelines, which take into account
a defendant's criminal background.
   Burns admitted filing two false claim forms in June for more
than $56,000. Burns also pleaded guilty to a charge that he failed
to report any of the money he embezzled as income to avoid paying
taxes of $475,685.
   According to the plea agreement, Burns agreed to surrender his
$300,000 house in Burtonsville, Md., and all the possessions and
property he bought with the money.
   Burns' wife, Kathy, will be allowed to keep a car and $10,000
and necessary household goods ``to get a start in life with her two
children,'' Cole told the judge.
   Prosecutors agreed not to bring any charges against Mrs. Burns
``if any would be appropriate,'' Cole said.
   Burns and his attorney, David Addis, left the U.S. Courthouse
without commenting on the case.
   Urging Johnson to allow Burns to remain free on $500,000 bond,
Addis argued Burns won't jump bail. ``He has a family, he has two
children, he knows he has injured them terribly. He is not going to
do anything to compound that.''
   The judge allowed Burns to remain free on bond pending
sentencing.
   As part of the plea agreement, Burns and his wife agreed to give
government investigators a full accounting of their assets. Burns
agreed to make up the difference between the money the government
collects from selling his property and the amount he stole.
   He also faces civil tax penalties, Cole said.
   Burns also agreed to cooperate with a continuing investigation,
Cole said. Investigators determined there was an unspecified amount
of additional money taken in a related embezzlement scheme, Cole
said.

   The Senate unanimously confirmed Richard L.
Thornburgh as attorney general on Thursday, sending him to take
command of a Justice Department wracked by turmoil over his
predecessor's ethics.
   The vote was 85-0.
   Thornburgh succeeds Edwin Meese III, who quit after pronouncing
himself exonerated by an independent counsel's report that
concluded he ``probably'' broke the law.
   The Senate adjourned until Sept. 7 without acting on three other
nominees for top Justice Department positions. Several senators
used parliamentary maneuvering to block action until the Senate
first took up legislation to enforce a treaty against genocide. The
genocide legislation was not considered.
   The three already are serving in acting capacities: Harold
Christensen as deputy attorney general; Francis A. Keating II as
associate attorney general; and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of
the criminal division.
   All four were recommended unanimously for confirmation by the
Senate Judiciary Committee, which acted on Thornburgh's nomination
Wednesday by voice vote, without debate. The other three were
cleared by the panel Aug. 3.
   Thornburgh, in a television interview broadcast Thursday in
Philadelphia, said he had no indication that Vice President George
Bush would retain him if elected president.
   ``I look on this as a six-month assignment,'' Thornburgh said.
``Every day will be important because the process of law
enforcement is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day a week, year-round
proposition and I'm anxious and enthusiastic about getting on the
job. ... We'll let the future take care of itself.''
   ``Clearly, we have a superior nominee here,'' Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said of Thornburgh as members of both parties praised the
former Pennsylvania governor.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. said Thornburgh has demonstrated the
characteristics needed for the job: ``character, integrity, good
judgment, competence and independence.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., praised Thornburgh but also
criticized Meese as one willing to ``roll back decades of progress
on civil rights.''
   Kennedy predicted Thornburgh ``will do as much as he can to
repair the damage of the Meese regime.''
   Meese has strongly disagreed with such comments, contending his
conduct was ethical and that department morale remained high while
he was investigated.
   Thornburgh, 56, a former two-term Pennsylvania Republican
governor, promised senators last week that he would run the
department with the ``highest ethical standards.'' He pledged not
to interfere with an ongoing internal department investigation of
Meese.
   The predecessors of Christensen and Dennis _ former Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns and ex-criminal division chief
William Weld _ announced their resignations last March to protest
Meese's continued tenure in the face of the investigation by
independent counsel James McKay.
   Keating was named to replace Steve Trott, who now is a federal
appellate judge.
   Thornburgh ran the Justice Department's criminal division during
the Ford administration, and established the public integrity
section that prosecutes corrupt public officials. Currently, he
directs the Institute of Politics of Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government.
   He told senators last week he is every bit the Reagan loyalist,
declaring, ``His agenda is my agenda.''
   Thornburgh said fighting the ``scourge of narcortics'' would be
his top priority. He promised a vigorous battle against organized
crime, public corruption and white-collar crime, while safeguarding
civil liberties.
   McKay concluded in an 800-plus page report that Meese
``probably'' broke two tax laws and twice violated a federal
conflict-of-interest statute _ but he declined to prosecute the
attorney general.

   Farmers say the $3.9 billion drought-relief
package ready for President Reagan's signature today is ``better
than nothing,'' but it won't stop the drought from driving some
farm families off the land.
   The measure provides aid for farmers suffering crop losses of
more than 35 percent of their expected harvest because of the
drought or other calamities such as hail, insect damage or
excessive rain. The payments would be equal to 65 percent of the
lost income.
   Farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected
yield would receive payments equal to 90 percent of lost income.

   Shock waves reverberating through world
financial markets in recent days reflect fears that the Federal
Reserve may have set off spiraling interest-rate increases that
will circulate around the globe.
   ``Until there is a clear-cut signal that the economies of the
world are growing at a slower pace, the bias is going to be toward
higher (interest) rates,'' says David Resler, chief economist at
Nomura Securities International Inc. But he doesn't expect an
all-out rate war.
   In the long term, higher interest rates can work to stabilize
stock and bond prices by calming inflation worries. But in the
immediate aftermath of the Fed's increase in its key lending rate
Tuesday, many traders remained skittish.

   Senate Democrats are accusing the Republican
White House of yielding to election-year politics by brushing aside
efforts to obtain a broad bipartisan consensus on aid to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Senate Republicans contend they did not vote for a Democratic
Contra aid plan because it did not represent a truly bipartisan
approach, and could not guarantee aid would reach the Contras
inside Nicaragua.
   No Republicans joined the majority when the Senate voted 49-47
on Wednesday to approve a Democratic proposal to provide the
Contras with $27 million in non-lethal ``humanitarian'' aid after
Oct. 1 and to set the stage for a second vote on the possible
resumption of $16.3 million in stockpiled military aid later in the

   Commending ``the indomitable spirit'' of
drought-stricken farmers, President Reagan on Thursday signed
America's largest-ever disaster relief bill.
   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said. ``But it'll
tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you
to return to your accustomed role.''
   The president signed the measure just hours before the
Agriculture Department issued a new crop forecast that said
production of the nation's No. 1 crop, corn, would be down more
than a third from last year. The drought will cause consumer food
prices to go up an average 3 percent to 5 percent from 1987.

   Major U.S. banks boosted the prime lending rate
back into the double digits Thursday for the first time in three
years, reflecting the Federal Reserve's drive to push all interest
rates higher to stave off inflation.
   The half-percentage point hike in the prime _ to 10 percent _
pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of
1985. It was the third increase in the rate so far this year and
the second in a month.
   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and
adjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch the
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise
in recent months.

account.''
   ``I will reveal something interesting,'' Shomron said on Israel

Iran's July 18 announcement that it was ready to accept a

   Israel has monitored the war carefully, believing the outcome

Arab-Israeli conflict.
   While military and intelligence officers said Israel was safer
while Iran and Iraq were fighting each another, they also worried
about Israel becoming an eventual target for built-up Iraqi forces
that were better trained as a result of the war.

<TEXT>
   Modern pioneers of bison genetics are
trying to bring back large numbers of the burly beasts as a source
of low-cholesterol meat.
   Using cattle as surrogate mothers, a Cheyenne-based group of
scientists and ranchers plans to breed bison as the animal of the
future for an increasingly health-conscious society.
   ``We see there is nowhere near the number of bison for the
demand,'' said Paul Butler, manager of the group, Livestock
Research and Innovation. ``In order to make any type of dramatic
increase you've got to use the new techniques.''
   Bison were on the brink of extinction at the end of the last
century, when hide-hunters of the Great Slaughter reduced herds of
millions to fewer than 300. Now bison are multiplying slowly,
numbering 80,000 to 100,000, according to the Denver-based American
Buffalo Association.
   The animals also are arousing appetites in the meat market.
   ``Basically the meat's better,'' Butler said, referring to
positive results in recent taste tests. ``It's got more protein and
less fat, and yet it's tender and flavorful.''
   LRI wants to capitalize by getting cattle to give birth to bison
and nurse the calves until they reach the age of slaughter. With
help from the University of Wyoming, researchers have been
artificially inseminating female bisons treated with hormones.
Fertilized embryos are flushed out of the bisons and implanted in
cattle, allowing bison cows to produce more embryos without waiting
to give birth themselves.
   So far cows have rejected all implanted bison embryos, but the
confidence of embryo transfer experts and interest expressed by the
Wyoming Department of Agriculture have fueled optimism.
   ``We've got to perfect the techniques,'' Butler said. ``There
are certain adjustments we have to make when working with bisons.
They are a big, strong, wild animal. They're not easy to handle.''
   Colorado State University professor George Seidel, a
reproductive physiologist who pioneered embryo transfer techniques
with horses, cows, sheep and rabbits, does not doubt the methods
will work with bison.
   ``The technique is not too different from the test-tube baby,''
Seidel said. ``I would expect it would work.''
   Similarly, University of Wyoming Animal Science professor Gary
Moss, who is guiding the LRI project, said he is sure it can be
done.
   Butler has been talking with buyers in New Zealand and
Australia. Besides bison he envisions selling frozen bison embryos
guaranteed to grow for about $10,000 each.
   Not everyone is so enthusiastic.
   Embryo transfer proponent David MacKenzie, a Lousiana State
professor of plant pathology, cautioned, ``We've got to get smarter
about how we do this.''
   And activist Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on
Economic Trends, warned in an appearance in Wyoming that mixing
breeds in high-technology projects can lead to an undesirable
homogenization of species.
   Nonetheless, a University of Wyoming marketing study suggested
further uses of the bison.
   ``With bison, you can sell everything from the head to the
tail,'' researchers wrote. ``Bison by-products include heads,
robes, skulls, leather goods, wood and jewelry made from their
bones and horns.''
   Bison ranchers are quick to point out the profit potential of an
enterprise that could dramatically increase the number of the
species.
   ``There's an incredible market for it,'' said John Flocchini,
who manages a herd of about 2,500 buffalo on the Durham Ranch near
Gillette. ``I wish we had about five or six times the number of
animals that we have.''
   The Durham ranch sells bison meat in California, where Flocchini
found ``there's just way more demand than there is supply.''
   Moreover, Flocchini and others believe few animals are more
suitable than bison for Wyoming, where harsh weather and predators
pose problems for cattle ranchers.
   A recent study sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Service found
that bison use nutrients in poor feed grain more efficiently than
cattle. The study concluded that ``bison ranching could be an
alternative to cattle in areas of poor forage and severe winters.''
   Despite these bright economic prospects, Flocchini said he would
be reluctant to dive into bison genetics.
   ``The way things are right now we're happy with the profit
margin that we are making,'' Flocchini said.
   ``I have a hard time messing with Mother Nature. The buffalo is
an animal that's already been too screwed up by human
intervention.''

<HEAD>Irish Airport, Laughed Off as a Joke, Now Makes Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOCK, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Knock Airport opened three years ago
in a misty peat bog, critics called it an Irish joke.
   Today, the airport that was the dream of a Roman Catholic parish
priest is making a small profit, confounding economists, government
officials and most everyone else who predicted its speedy demise.
   Success is due mainly to a fledgling independent Irish airline,
Ryanair, which started using the airport in one of the poorest and
most isolated areas of western Ireland when no other carrier was
interested.
   ``We plan to carry more than 100,000 passengers through Knock
this year,'' said Louise Henahan, spokeswoman for the 3-year-old
airline. ``It is definitely not a white elephant,''
   The airport owes its existence to the late Monsignor James
Horan, who was administrator of the Knock shrine, the most
important Catholic shrine in Ireland which attracts more than a
million visitors a year.
   Horan saw how an airport had benefitted Lourdes, France's famous
shrine, and believed one would also transform economically
depressed County Mayo, where unemployment is nearly 50 percent in
some areas.
   He persuaded the government to give the airport 9.7 million
Irish pounds ($6.8 million) and raised an additional 2.5 million
pounds ($1.76 million) by traveling the world appealing to Irishmen
abroad and organizing collections at home.
   For Horan, who died in August 1986, the first flight from the
airport on Oct. 25, 1985, was the second miracle of Knock.
   The first is in church records a occurring in 1879, when 15
people reported seeing an apparation of the Virgin Mary on the
Church of St. John the Baptist in Knock, now the centerpiece of the
shrine.
   As Horan pressed ahead, criticism grew.
   Ireland's communications minister, Jim Mitchell, called Knock
Airport ``an ill-advised project, far distant from any sizable
town, high on a foggy and boggy hill.''
   Economists predicted big losses and Irish singer Christy Moore
spoofed Horan's business acumen with a lyric: ``From Fatima to
Bethlehem, from Lourdes to Kiltinagh, there's never been a miracle
like the airport up at Knock.''
   The airport _ 604 feet above sea level on a peat bog plateau
with an 8,100-foot runway capable of handling jumbo jets _
officially opened in May 1986.
   But nobody wanted to use it and the staff was put on a week-on,
week-off schedule.
   Seamus Monaghan, the airport chairman, recalled how Horan wasn't
worried and put his faith in divine intervention.
   ``Sure enough, 10 days later we had a letter of application from
Ryanair,'' said Monaghan.
   Ryanair started regular flights from Knock in December 1986 and
carried 47,000 passengers in 1987, mainly local people who worked
in Britain.
   Jim Ryan, the airport company's secretary, said Ryanair now
operates 44 to 46 flights weekly, mainly from Britain, and expects
to carry 110,000 to 120,000 passengers through Knock this year. The
airport will also handle 10,000 to 20,000 charter flight passengers
in 1988, he said.
   That's still far fewer than the 250,000 passengers Horan hoped
the airport would handle in its first year.
   But Ryan, who would not disclose the figures, said Knock went
into the black after its first six months of this year.
   The big ambition for Knock is to get direct flights from the
United States, which now land at Shannon Airport.
   Bridget Watton, 46, an Irish computer operator working in
Britain, has used the service since it opened to visit her parents
on Achill Island, off Ireland's west coast.
   ``It's a godsend to the west of Ireland,'' Ms. Watton said on
recent flight from Luton Airport, near London. ``Before, it took a
day by boat and train to get to Achill. Now, I can get home in six
hours.''
   Desmond O'Brien, who runs the Dunnamara Guest House in Luna
Point on the west coast, said business is brisk with Mayo emigrants
returning more often from England for weddings, funeral and
holidays.
   About 40 percent of the passengers at Knock Airport are
tourists, usually discovering the west of Ireland for the first
time.
   Although Horan didn't live to see Knock Airport make any
significant impact, the airport's new name is a lasting tribute to
his vision: Connaught Horan International Airport.

<HEAD>Once Sleepy Bangalore Now India's Silicon City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGALORE, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a sleeping haven for retirees in
British colonial times, Bangalore today is India's version of
Silicon Valley.
   It manufactures about one-third of the total electronics output
of the country and 80 percent of its professional electronics
equipment.
   R. Murali, who quit a government job 15 years ago to set up a
successful television component factory, said Bangalore's
advantages were obvious.
   ``It's a lovely city and I like the fact that it's dust-free.''
   For many years after India's independence from Britain in 1947,
Bangalore was mainly a pensioners' paradise, known for moderate
weather and for its lakes, parks and British-style clubs.
   Situated in southern India about 200 miles inland from Madras on
the Bay of Bengal, Bangalore had one of the country's largest
British military populations and was the only territory directly
ruled by London, over the head of the British viceroy in India.
   Its temperate climate _ the temperature ranges from 68 to 80
most of the year _ makes the city ideal but for makers of high
technology products.
   But a variety of other factors combined to make Bangalore an
upscale metropolis and one of the 10 fastest growing cities in the
world.
   ``Industrialization in Bangalore started in the early 1970s,''
said Vinod Vyasulu, a professor at Bangalore's Institute of
Management. ``It was brought about by the cheapest electricity
rates in the country, a ready-made transport infrastructure and
cheap, skilled labor.''
   The number of industries in the city has risen from about 600 in
1975 to about 2,000, according to T.M. Shirur, a state government
official. At least half of them are connected with high-technology
manufacture, he said.
   Labor is perhaps the most important factor for industrialists
setting up in Bangalore. The city's work force largely rejected
labor unions and strikes are rare.
   Michael Lee, an urban affairs specialist with the U.S. Agency
for International Development, said Bangalore is India's premier
science city because of the availability of ``a pool of brains.''
   Scientific talent is plentiful because Bangalore is the home of
the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institute of
Management, both regarded as premier schools for advanced study,
Lee said.
   U.S. AID is scheduled to put up $12 million to open a center for
technological development in Bangalore. It will organize training
programs for workers and provide support services to industry.
   The U.S. company Texas Instruments has set up a plant, and joint
venture factories with Indian firms have been formed by Motorola of
Illinois and Pacific Intelidata of California.
   India's government also has set up state-owned factories making
electronics gear, aircraft, watches and telecommunication equipment.
   Lee compared Bangalore's attractions to those that drew
electronics manufacturers to Silicon Valley in Califonia, areas in
the U.S. Southwest and Route 128 around Boston.
   But Bangalore's growth also has brought problems. The population
has risen by 76 percent over the past decade and is now estimated
at 4 million.
   Residents complain that services have failed to keep pace and
that water, electricity and transport systems fall short of demand.
   Longtime citizens complain that Bangalore is no longer the
garden city it once was. Some insist the temperature is higher,
robbing Bangalore of one of its attractions.
   ``When I entered Bangalore during my college vacations in the
early '60s, I used to pull on a small sweater,'' says Vijay Padaki,
a teacher now based in the city. ``Now I don't use my woolens any
more.''
   But a study of Bangalore's climate shows no appreciable change
in air temperatures since 1870. The study concedes, however, that
urbanization might have changed the ``micro-climate,'' which is not
reflected in recorded temperatures.
   The city looks more Westernized than others in India. Jeans and
T-shirts are in far greater evidence than ethnic wear.
   Pubs are something new. Bangalore is the only city in India to
have draft beer, and the pubs are enormously successful. India
Today magazine reported recently that city pubs sold about 35,000
mugs of beer on weekdays and double that on weekends and holidays.
   The city is also home to one of the largest bookshops in India _
the Gangarams Book Bureau, which stocks 400,000 English titles and
notches up sales of 50,000 rupees ($3,850) a day.
   ``We get buyers from all over India,'' said Atma Ram, one of the
store's two proprietors.
   The cosmopolitan nature and tastes of Bangalore also make it an
ideal market to test new products. New brands of shampoos, soaps
and tea are now routinely marketed in Bangalore before going on
sale in the rest of India.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candice Bergen is a glamorous film actress
married to esteemed French film director Louis Malle. They have a
young daughter and an elegant lifestyle divided between New York
and Paris.
   Nevertheless, Bergen this fall will undertake the relative
drudgery of starring in a weekly comedy on CBS, ``Murphy Brown.''
   Bergan plays the title character, a hard-driving television
reporter who has gone a few rounds with alcohol and nicotine
addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic and just been sent back to her
high-stress world as a correspondent on the network newsmagazine
`F.Y.I.''
   ``I wasn't quite ready to do a television series, but then there
were whispers about this pilot script,'' Bergen told a group of TV
critics. ``Everybody was sort of grabbing it and there were little
fingernail marks all over it, and they said, you know there's this
pilot script that's as if it's been written for you.''
   Bergen was skeptical but finally read the script, by Diane
English, during a boring plane trip.
   ``I got up, and it was the first time I ever made a phone call
from an airplane,'' Bergen said. ``I was then so panic-stricken
that I might have lost the script, that I'd waited too long. And so
I called my agent and said, what do I have to do?
   ``I hadn't read a feature script that was as good as this in a
long time. And I hadn't read a character that I thought was any
better for me than this, maybe ever. I just was so excited at the
possibility of doing this kind of work and doing comedy work.''
   The idea of Bergen doing comedy will not surprise anyone who saw
her in ``Starting Over'' or on ``Saturday Night Live,'' and it
certainly comes as no surprise to anyone who has seen the pilot of
``Murphy Brown.''
   In that episode, Murphy has just gotten out of the clinic and
everybody is taking odds as to whether she'll be her old
tough-reporter self without the aid of outside stimuli. Murphy
herself isn't certain.
   Her first hurdle is an interview with a young man whose alleged
affair with a female politician caused a scandal.
   Murphy also has a home life, so to speak. Her companions are a
house painter-in-residence (Robert Pastorelli), who has begun a
mural on her kitchen ceiling, and a collection of Motown records to
which she caterwauls, a skill Bergen perfected in ``Starting Over.''
   ``I think it's hard to sing badly the first time, and then once
you kind of break the bad singing barrier, it's like you're
supersonic,'' Bergen said.
   Co-starring with Bergen are Grant Shaud as the new executive
producer of ``F.YI.,'' who looks 14. Charles Kimbrough plays a
dead-pan fellow correspondent, Joe Regalbuto is a crazed
investigative reporter and Faith Ford plays a former beauty queen
more interested in reliving past triumphs than uncovering new
stories.
   Because of the writers' strike, the premiere will likely not
reach the air until Novermber, said English. She and her husband,
Joel Shukovsky, are co-executive producers of the series. English
produced ``My Sister Sam'' and previously ``Foley Square,'' two
critically praised series that failed because of poor time periods.
   Bergen said she ``was always sort of a journalism junkie.''
Right out of college, the daughter of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen
auditioned for a spot on CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' She didn't get the
job but years later did fill in as a co-host on NBC's ``Today''
show, so Murphy's world is not completely alien to her.
   Bergen says comedy seems to be a matter of ``genetic encoding.''
   ``Actually I have a Shriner aspect of my personality, which is
sort of a whoopee cushion, all those things,'' she said. ``I do
have that side, which is probably from my father _ not to malign
the Shriners, you understand, they do fine work _ but it's sort of
a broader, more of a vaudevillian sense of humor.''
   ``It's very true,'' English agreed. ``That's the surprising
thing about getting to know Candice. The first thing she said to us
was I'll do anything for a laugh. And I believe her.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   MUDD SAYS `ROGER' TO PBS _ Former network anchor Roger Mudd says
he's just pleased as can be to be working for public television
this election year. He'll anchor election coverage for ``The
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' and doesn't miss the action with either
CBS or NBC, he told a PBS news conference. Public TV, he said,
``has temporarily halted my aging process. ... You're accepted for
your ideas and your suggestions and not who you are or what your
ratings are and who your agent is.'' At PBS, Mudd said, ``The
priorities are in good order, and at the commercial networks, to my
way of thinking, they were not. I don't make as much money, not as
many people watch me, but inwardly I'm more happy.'' Mudd quit NBC
last year after the network canceled his prime-time newsmagazine
``1986.''

<HEAD>British Boy Collects Record 2 Million Postcards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen-year-old Mario Morby
began collecting postcards for charity last year during a battle
with cancer. He has received nearly 2 million of them in the mail,
setting a world record.
   But he has mixed feelings about the Great Postcard Flood, and
prefers swimming and tennis to collecting them, now that his cancer
is in remission. For Mario and his family, it's been the story of a
good cause waylaid somewhere in the mail.
   With some well-wishers from around the world thinking he was
someone else and others accusing him of a hoax, the cards cheered
Mario but pained him too. For these and other reasons, Mario's
entry will be the first and last for the Guinness Book of Records
in postcard collecting.
   ``I thought I was only going to get 48,000,'' said Mario, a
cheerful, curly-haired boy who suffered more than two years of
grueling treatment for a malignant tumor in the pelvis.
   ``But they kept coming. One day I had 60 sacks,'' he said at his
home near the central England city of Birmingham.
   His father, David Morby, sorted cards from early afternoon to 1
or 2 a.m. every day for months, and estimates they received 2
million. His mother, Anna, said ``it took over'' their lives and
those of their other two children Dassos, 17, and Elena, 8.
   The saga began last September when the Birmingham Children's
Hospital, where Mario was treated, asked him to take over the
campaign another boy had started. Its aim was to set a record and
raise money for the hospital.
   So far, the family has raised 1,700 pounds ($2,800) through
sales at an auction house which has taken most of the cards. Many
were picture postcards from around the world. Purchasers of the
cards mainly were people who collect postcards, as others collect
stamps.
   Some of the cards Mario received were considered valuable _ his
mother said a few dated back to the 18th century _ but Mario has
kept only three.
   Postcards are still trickling in, but the post office now
diverts them to a local cancer fund-raising group.
   Worse than the numbers were the distortions. Small ads placed
locally by the family were spread by others, and the further afield
the appeals went, the more skewed the message became.
   ``They started coming with my Dad's name,'' says Mario. ``They
thought I was a 7-year-old boy named David. They were saying, `God
Bless, I'm sorry to hear you're dying.'
   ``Sometimes they sent things too, but they were all things for
7-year-olds,'' said Mario, whose mother says her son didn't know
that cancer could kill him until he read the cards.
    ``If I thought it was going to get out of hand the way it did,
I wouldn't have done it,'' said Mario's father, who quit his job as
a stonemason to spend time with his son when he became ill and only
recently found other work cooking chickens for retail sale.
   ``But he got his name in the Guinness book and we raised money
for the hospital, which is something I wanted to do. They saved his
life,'' he said.
   Mario's mother said the cards helped occupy Mario during the
long days when he was too ill to attend school.
   Mario, now back at school full time, said, ``sometimes when I
was bored or sick, I'd sort out the postcards.''
   Not all were pleasant, said Mrs. Morby. Some people mixed up
Mario with a fictional 8-year-old cancer-stricken Scottish boy,
``Buddy,'' who was at the center of a five-year hoax.
   A mystery hoaxer had circulated appeals in 1982 saying Buddy's
last wish was to get a record number of postcards to win a place in
the Guinness Book of Records, and some 10 million people, including
President Reagan, responded.
   Because it was a hoax, Guinness did not count that collection as
a record.
   As a result of that hoax, Mario received letters accusing him of
being the perpetrator.
   ``Sometimes we had people calling us con men,'' he said.
   Guinness will list Mario as having received 1,265,000 cards,
which is where it stopped its count, said spokeswoman Anna
Nicholas. However, the Buddy hoax and other factors led Guinness to
decide to halt the category.
   ``We do feel sometimes it can generate hoaxes and complications
for families like Mario Morby's,'' she said. For now though, ``the
whole thing is over. So everyone is smiling.''

<HEAD>Drugs Smugglers Use the Obvious and Ingenious in Canada</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar amounts are U.S.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They pose as a happy family on vacation but stuff
their suitcases with marijuana. Others blithely sail into port with
a hold full of liquid hashish, or dissolve their illicit cargo in
windshield wiper fluid.
   Whether the methods are obvious or ingenious, most drug
smugglers in Canada are evading detection, say law enforcement
agencies.
   Only a fraction of the 90 million travelers who entered Canada
last year were checked for narcotics and few drug shipments were
intercepted, said Arthur Lewis, head of enforcement at Canada
Customs.
   ``I've seen estimates as low as 5 percent,'' he said. ``We're
not naive enough to think we're going to stop it.''
   Vast empty spaces and a 5,335-mile border with the United States
make Canada an easy touch for drug traffic in both directions.
   ``They're trying to move further and further north because of
(law enforcement) pressure in Florida and so little patrol
capability here,'' said Lewis.
   Authorities rule out a U.S.-style ``zero tolerance'' blitz at
the border because of concern for constitutional rights.
   ``I don't think our country would tolerate it,'' said Detective
Inspector Gerry Hawke of Ontario Provincial Police.
   Canadian enforcers did seize 40 tons of illicit drugs last year
and nab more than 10,000 people for drug offenses. Customs agents
expect to confiscate drugs worth $330 million this year, a tenfold
increase since 1982.
   Large-volume traffickers use sealed ship containers and trailer
trucks, knowing that police cannot possibly check them all.
   ``Trailers are lined up at all the bridges from the U.S. and we
know a fair amount of drugs are coming in this way. But we can't
ask them all to unload,'' said Hawke.
   Drugs were also found in a baby's diapers, jade figurines, a
piano, the tubing of a luggage cart, scuba tanks, sacks of coffee,
in the lining of running shoes, car windshield wiper fluid and a
truck's hydraulic system, officers said. One hardened cocaine
solution was disguised as a shipment of ponchos.
   A trawler was seized at Vancouver in British Columbia with eight
tons of marijuana from Thailand, and a woman and her son were
jailed for attempting to import $1.6 million worth of Columbian
cocaine in 3.5-ounce packages sent registered mail.
   ``Swallowers and stuffers'' concealing drugs on their person are
the bane of airport security, said Inspector Neil Pouliot of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A chief method is to swallow condoms
filled with cocaine.
   Thorough body searches are increasing. ``There is no moral code
when you're dealing with narcotics. Everything is fair game,'' said
Customs inspector Michael Crichton.
   U.S. customs officers at Niagara Falls found $75 million worth
of heroin in the false bottom of a suitcase two Vietnamese-born
couriers were taking to New York. Police in Regina in Saskatchewan
discovered a basement lined with aluminum foil where a forest of
marijuana was growing hydroponically under 5,000 watt lightbulbs
and an automatic watering system.
   Neither Canada Customs nor the Mounted Police even attempt to
patrol the Great Lakes, an open invitation to drug merchants. ``We
rely on inside information so we can be there to meet them,'' said
Lewis.
   His problem is that Customs has just 197 drug officers
nationwide, aided by 32 dog teams sniffing baggage and cargo at
ports of entry. The Mounties deploy 1,100 drug enforcers, including
27 liaison officers at Canadian embassies from Thailand to Jamaica
and one each in Miami, Fla., New York and Los Angeles.
   The country's combined anti-narcotics force of 1,500
concentrates on suppliers, not users. Even with major busts, street
prices declined last year as the flow continued.
   The Mounties estimate the drug trade in Canada is now worth $8.3
billion a year, while their budget to combat the scourge is less
than $83 million.
   ``The market is expanding, there's no doubt about that,'' said
the Mounties' assistant commissioner, Marcel Coutu. ``We could do a
better job if we had more money and more people.''
   Drug offenses also rose 9 percent last year; Montreal police say
half the crime in the city is now drug-related. Marijuana remains
the most popular drug, while Canada has about 500,000 cocaine users
_ compared to an estimated 12 million in the United States. Crack
use is not widespread.
   Soviet customs agents helped with the best tip of the year. They
told the Mounties that a drug ring planned to ship 11,277 pounds of
hashish from Kabul, Afghanistan, through Leningrad to Montreal. The
hash was seized on arrival and three Canadians are now behind bars.
   Ontario police hope a proposed new law will enable them to
freeze the proceeds of drug trafficking when an arrest is made.
Unlike U.S. legislation, however, the seized assets would not be
earmarked to fight drugs.
   The Italian Mafia, Chinese triads, Iranian, Pakistani and other
criminal organizations control the heroin market, while Colombian
crime families are flooding Canada with cocaine, according to the
Mounted Police. Other drugs are imported by Vietnamese gangs in
Vancouver, motorcycle gangs such as the Hell's Angels and Satan's
Choice, and traffickers from Jamaica and Lebanon.
   The foot soldiers in trafficking, or ``mules,'' are ordinary
people recruited for cash, as a Jamaican immigrant in Toronto
recently disclosed.
   She told The Toronto Star she earned $16,600 bringing three
suitcases stuffed with 150 pounds of marijuana back from Kingston.
She sailed through customs by traveling with her husband and three
young sons and pretending to be vacationers.
   ``The whole scam is so easy it's ridiculous,'' the 35-year-old
woman said.

<TEXT>
   With an actor's grace and a politician's
flair, President Reagan's farewell to the party he returned to the
White House is designed to avoid stealing the show from the new
standardbearer, George Bush.
   Reagan himself insisted on delivering his speech to the
Republican National Convention on Monday instead of later in the
week, where it might draw attention from Bush, officials say.
   If the two men appear together in New Orleans this week, it will
only be briefly.
   ``This is his (Reagan's) swan song. The convention will be awash
with nostalgia,'' says Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, head of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``But it has to end on a note
of looking to the future, sending off the man we hope will be
president for the next eight years.''
   It will be an emotional time for the man who appeared in several
motion pictures, hosted ``Death Valley Days'' and ``GE Theater''
and burst onto the national scene during the 1964 convention that
nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona for president.
   Reagan, who led the GOP to the White House in 1980 in a bitter
defeat for President Jimmy Carter, faces a bittersweet transition
as a 77-year-old president with little beyond Bush's election on
his remaining agenda. In retirement, he plans to speak for repeal
of the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.
   The White House gave Reagan the leading role he rarely got as a
Hollywood actor. And he's relished this attention. But a
performer's feel for stage positioning convinced Reagan that Bush
must stand without him for Thursday's climatic convention moments,
party and campaign officials say.
   So the GOP passed up the chance to have the nation see Bush
hoist his arms in a unity show with Reagan. However, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said tentative plans call for Reagan and
Bush to meet on Tuesday at Belle Chase Naval Air Station, as Reagan
is leaving the convention city and Bush is arriving.
   Republican Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, talking of Reagan's
Monday night speech, said, ``I think we're going to see a very
proud man _ proud of the accomplishments of the last seven years.''
   ``Ronald Reagan at his age looks as good if not better than he
did when he came into office,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``Ronald Reagan is
an individual who knows who he is and is comfortable with who he
is. That's why, in many ways, Ronald Reagan doesn't have an ego
problem.''
   A source who participated in talks about the presidential role
in New Orleans, discussing a conversation on grounds of anonymity,
said Reagan at one point this spring argued forcefully about which
day he would speak.
   ``Initially it was penciled in that he would do the speech on
Tuesday night,'' this source said. ``But he realizes that wherever
he goes, he's the focus of media attention. This was his decision.
He said, `I don't want to do it Tuesday. I want to do it Monday.'''
   Gov. Thomas Kean's keynote address was thus put off until
Tuesday, as party strategists sought to make Reagan's valedictory
and Bush's coming out party politically compatible and graceful.
   Mitchell Daniels, White House political adviser in earlier
Reagan years, said ``no one is more conscious of the need for this
to be a George Bush convention than Ronald Reagan.''
   ``He'll be very comfortable with the balance that has been
struck,'' said Daniels, a Hudson Institute scholar who's going to
the convention as a delegate from Indiana. ``A lesser man would
have insisted on a bigger share of the limelight.''
   Said Vander Jagt, R-Mich., ``The challenge is to make `Hello!'
to George Bush as exciting as `Goodbye!' to Ronald Reagan.''
   From a variety of Republican sources, declining to be named
publicly, the Reagan itinerary in New Orleans will go like this:
   The president and his wife Nancy will arrive on Sunday, have
dinner with several members of the family and renew some political
acquaintances. On Monday, Mrs. Reagan will be the guest of honor at
a luncheon being organized by the president's daughter, Maureen
Reagan. On Monday night, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., will
deliver a testimonial to his longtime friend. Mrs. Reagan will
precede her husband on the podium, speaking briefly to the 2,277
convention delegates.
   After that, there will be a film presentation on the Reagan
presidency. The president will arrive on the podium while delegates
are watching the film in darkness, to await his reception when the
lights go back on.
   He'll address a fund-raising breakfast away from the convention
hotel Tuesday morning and then head to his vacation ranch in the
Santa Ynez Mountains of California.
   Reagan, who reminded the 1984 Dallas convention it was ``the
last time'' he would address such a gathering as a candidate, has
said people should be able to elect a president as often as they
wish.
   But he also has said he was never interested in a seeking a
third term.
   James David Barber, a Duke University presidential scholar, said
the mood at the New Orleans convention will likely be cheerful, but
also nostalgic.
   ``Nancy's counsel to him (Reagan) will be that, `This is the
last major speech that he'll make in a power situation, and
therefore it should be the best,'' Barber speculated. He said that
Mrs. Reagan seems to have ``a fundamental concern'' with how
history will judge her husband.
   ``There'll be a lot of cheers, a lot of tears'' when Reagan
speaks, said Donald Devine, a former head of the Office of
Personnel Management who now runs Citizens For America, a
self-styled grass-roots Reagan organization.
   ``I'm sure what's going on in their mind is, they don't want
Ronald Reagan to steal the scene, and that's a legitimate
consideration,'' Devine said. ``I think at first the president was
a little bit hesitant (about warmly embracing Bush's candidacy),
but I have do doubt that they are working together now.''

<HEAD>A Man and His Dream: An Interview With the Filmmakers of
``Tucker''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They could scarcely be more different: one
with neatly trimmed hair and beard and a boy's figure,
quiet-spoken, thoughtful; the other with the unkempt look of a
struggling artist, an impetuous man with a loud laugh and hearty
appetites, as evidenced by his belly.
   They are George Lucas and Francis Coppola, respectively. Along
with Steven Spielberg, they are the titans of American film in the
post-major studio era. Despite their outward differences, Lucas,
42, and Coppola, 49, have been friends and often partners for two
decades, after meeting in film school in the late 1960s.
   Both conduct their operations outside of Hollywood, in the San
Francisco Bay area. And both have created landmark films: Lucas
with the ``Star Wars'' trilogy; Coppola with ``The Godfather''
epics.
   Now Lucas has produced, and Coppola has directed, ``Tucker: The
Man and His Dream,'' which Paramount released this weekend. The $24
million saga, starring Jeff Bridges in the title role, is a true
story that obviously appealed to both filmmakers: A gifted
entrepreneur challenges the Establishment. He was Preston Tucker,
whose postwar attempt to market an innovative car ended in failure,
partly because of pressure from the Big Three automakers _ Ford,
General Motors and Chrysler.
   Coppola had mulled the Tucker idea over the years but always was
sidetracked with other projects. At one point he even considered
doing it as a musical.
   ``Tucker'' is not the first collaboration between Lucas and
Coppola. Lucas worked as Coppola's assistant on ``The Rain People''
in 1969, which was filmed on a five-month trip across the United
States. Coppola's Zoetrope company produced Lucas' science fiction
``THX 1138'' in 1970, which was not a success.
   Lucas was unable to find a studio for ``American Graffiti'' in
1973. Then Coppola hit big with ``The Godfather.'' Universal agree
to back ``Graffiti'' if Coppola would produce. Over the years they
have combined on other projects, including Akira Kurosawa's
``Kagemusha'' and Disneyland's ``Captain EO.''
   Coppola and Lucas recently talked about their collaboration with
The Associated Press. Here are highlights from that interview:
   Q. When did you first become intrigued with the Preston Tucker
saga?
   Coppola: It was a project I brought with me from college (UCLA).
I first learned about it by being one of the kids in those crowds
(looking at the car) depicted in the movie. My dad took me to see
it, and I was very disheartened when I heard the car wasn't going
to come out. I couldn't understand it. I said, ``It's a good car.
Why won't they let him make it?'' My father said, ``Oh, they won't
let him buy steel.''
   Lucas: Francis has talked to me about it over the years. Then
one time we were talking about movies, and I told him (``Tucker'')
could really be great. Eventually, he called and asked if I would
be interested in producing it. I said yes. Absolutely.
   We started on the screenplay with Arnold Schulman. Once we got a
script finished, I started taking it to the studios. Everybody
turned it down. It didn't fit into one of their little pigeonholes
of what they thought commercial movies were. If it doesn't fit one
of those little slots, they don't know what to do with it _ that,
combined with the expense.
   If that had been a $15 million movie, they would have said, ``We
don't understand this movie but we'll do it anyway because big
names are connected with it.'' We said we'd love to make it for $15
million but we can't. We have cars and factories and period
costumes and crowd scenes. Add that up and you have a big budget.
   Q. How many Tuckers do you own?
   Coppola: I have two, and he has two. My deal with the company
was that they could have my cars free of charge if they fixed them
up, made them beautiful _ and they did.
   Lucas: My deal was that we had all those cars there, and I was
able to buy two. I had to have as many as Francis did.
   Q. ``Tucker'' has a number of directorial touches, such as
angled shots and having both sides of a telephone conversation on
the screen at the same time. How did you arrive at the style?
   Coppola: I thought in the spirit of the car, which was a kind of
Rube Goldberg contraption, that the movie ought to have the same
flavor. Why make a movie about an innovative car unless you can do
those things in movie terms?
   Since Tucker was traveling a lot, I knew there would be a lot of
phone scenes. Normally, you shoot phone scenes separately. I
thought the actors would do better playing with each other. (Such
devices) are all in the wonderful studio tradition. As you know,
I've always been a fan of the Hollywood studio tradition and want
to see it continue. I'm always sad when I hear they have sold a
studio or dismantled a studio. They are assets that should be
preserved.
   Q. Both of you have worked outside the mainstream of the film
industry. Is there a parallel between your own careers and Tucker's?
   Lucas: I think one of the main themes of the movie is that
regardless whether a project succeeds or fails, the ideas that you
bring to it can live on. If you can keep your creative spirit
alive, that's what is really important. You must persevere over
adversity even if the projects you're working on don't work out.
You have to go on and do it again.
   That's one of the main themes in the film, and one of the main
themes for us personally. We've had to go through it time and time
again in order to get innovative ideas into movies. Every time we
get an idea like ``Tucker'' they'll say . . .
   Coppola: They'll say, ``No, it's not like anything we ever saw.
We don't want it.'' But then they'll copy it afterwards.
   Lucas: You go through that whole process every time. Whether the
project itself is successful, you have generated a lot of new
ideas. . . . It's the perseverence of the creative spirit that is
really important.
   Q. What did you learn from your first work together, ``The Rain
People''?
   Coppola: We realized you could make pictures anywhere. We
decided we were going to make films and be independent and use new
methods.

<HEAD>Movie Revives Memories In Tucker Hometown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The movie ``Tucker: The Man and His
Dream,'' has many people looking back at the postwar years, when
industrial dreams came true in the factory town.
   Preston Tucker's biggest venture _ a sleek, ahead-of-its-time
automobile that challenged the antiquated designs of the major
automakers _ was launched in 1946. It collapsed in 1949.
   The memory is still vivid for Mary Lee McAndrew, Tucker's
daughter, who at age 20 christened the first prototype car _
informally dubbed the Tucker Torpedo _ with a splash of champagne
in a June 1947 unveiling.
   McAndrew worked with director Francis Coppola while the film was
made. She recalled the days of traveling with her father to a
whirlwind of meetings with potential investors, dealers and others
at Chicago, Washington and New York hotels.
   Her ranch-style house, shaded by trees and overlooking the
Washtenaw Country Club's rolling fairways, is a few miles west of
the white house with its wide, pillared porch where Tucker and his
wife, Vera, lived with their five children, a menagerie of pets and
the ubiquitous cars.
   A few miles in the other direction, lives 78-year-old Daniel
Leabu. He was one of a handful of machinists and mechanics who
built the first four Tucker engines in a barn behind the Tucker
house.
   Leabu recalled the rush job: ``I was out there till two or three
o'clock in the morning, getting chicken, anything, just to keep
them working.''
   But too young to remember the rise and fall of the Tucker
automobile was Preston's grandson John Tucker, a 36-year-old store
designer.
   ``I was only 4 years old when he died,'' he said. ``About the
only thing I remember is sitting on his knee the summer before he
died. And I remember the energy that always went on around that
house.''
   Tucker's project started in boom times for Ypsilanti, about 35
miles west of Detroit. Not far from Leabu's house, Bomber Street is
a reminder of the round-the-clock production of bomber planes in a
plant operated by Henry Ford. Tucker's Ypsilanti Machine & Tool
Co., also thrived.
   Born in Capac, Mich., in 1903, Tucker grew up in the Lincoln
Park area south of Detroit. He worked as a policeman, and later
sold cars in Memphis, Tenn., and Indianapolis, before moving to
Ypsilanti.
   His company made a rotating ball gun-turret, designed for a fast
combat car devised by Tucker but actually used in airplanes.
   Building autos after the war came naturally, McAndrew said of
her father: ``All of his life he was into cars, from the first time
he saw one.''
   To manufacture his car, Tucker leased a mammoth plant near
Cicero, Ill., that produced aircraft engines during the war. The
plant is now a vast shopping mall, where observances are being held
in connection with the movie.
   He bought a company that made helicopter engines that could be
adapted to power the car. That was the job of Leabu and his crew.
In the movie, he is a character named Eddie.
   Tucker's house has been converted to apartments, and there are
cars parked in back. But the barn still stands, and Leabu recently
took a visitor there.
   ``This is where we started the first engine,'' he said in the
old barn. ``We hung a fuel tank from the ceiling, and hooked up a
battery, and it started. That was the most beautiful noise I ever
heard.''
   In 1948, the Tucker cars created a stir. They were capable of
going 120 miles an hour and, driven more economically, getting 30
miles to the gallon.
   Startling at the time were the rear-engine design, aerodynamic
styling, safety features such as seat belts, padded dash and
pop-out windows, and blue, maroon, silver and other brilliant
colors.
   Only 50 cars were built before pressure from the big automakers
and money problems collapsed the enterprise. A federal
investigation ended with Tucker's acquittal of fraud charges in a
1950 trial, but word of the probe had long since dried up funds.
   Jack Miller, a dealer in antique Hudson automobiles, said Tucker
might have been brought down regardless, by the same economic
forces that swallowed up other small auto companies such as Kaiser,
Nash, Hudson, Willys, Studebaker and Packard.
   ``People thought maybe he was going a little too fast,'' the
antique car dealer said.
   Leabu said Tucker might have had an edge others lacked. ``We had
something nobody ever had before, right at a point when the others
were getting retooled,'' he said. ``We needed a little more money
to get it across.
   ``He was one of the most ingenious men I've ever met.''
   Leabu's desk is full of memorabilia _ brass badges plant
employees wore, keys to Tucker cars and copies of Tucker Topics,
house organ of the short-lived plant.
   After his empire fell, Tucker returned to Ypsilanti and
continued running the machine and tool company. By the time Tucker
died of cancer in 1956, he had made several trips to Brazil to plan
the manufacture there of a car he called the Carioca.
   While the movie was being shot, Coppola often had children and
grandchildren around the set; therefore, he could understand the
boisterous, close-knit Tucker tribe that romped through the Park
Street house.
   ``We were all happy. We were a very loving family. The house was
full of people all the time, relatives, friends. We were
teen-agers, so we had all our friends,'' McAndrew said.
   There were pets, too, at one time including two cows, a pony and
a pig that were all trooped to a nearby pond to be soaped up and
washed down. ``We'd take the pony and the pig and everything,'' she
said. ``We had a ball. Dad was the first one in and the last one
out.''
   Vera Tucker, now 86 and living in Arizona, liked the film. ``She
thought it caught the spirit of the family very well, and my
father's magnetic spirit,'' her daughter said.
   She told Coppola during filming: ``My father is looking down on
this and smiling.''

<HEAD>Revolutionary, Ill-Fated Tucker Automobile a Collector's Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rare Tucker automobile, featuring a
spaceship design, roaming cyclops headlamp and rear-mounted engine,
is becoming a hot item for collectors with the release of a film
about the car's creator.
   Francis Coppola's ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream,'' which
chronicles the life of rebel automaker Preston Tucker, opened over
the weekend at theaters nationwide.
   But two major collector-car auctioneers based here disagree on
the movie's impact on the car's actual value. Rick Cole says the
current $50,000 pricetag should stay the same, but Tom Barrett
insists the value will soar to $250,000.
   ``It's worth $50,000 and that won't change,'' said Cole. ``It
was the De Lorean of the '40s. It was stuck together with glue and
spit and anything else.''
   Barrett disagrees. ``They are now selling in excess of $150,000
and these cars will go up rapidly with the movie,'' insisted
Barrett. ``They will easily go to $200,000.''
   Coppola has two Tuckers and producer George Lucas bought two as
soon as he finished making the movie with Coppola.
   ``Woe be the guy who runs out and buys a Tucker because of the
movie,'' warned Cole.
   Preston Tucker, with the help of designer Alex Tremulis, built a
safety-conscious luxury car that could be affordable. Barrett said
the only difference today is its affordability.
   When first introduced, Tucker owners displayed signs in the back
window reading, ``You've just been passed by a Tucker.''
   ``They were very fast, could go more than 100 mph,'' Barrett
said. ``The torque was so tremendous the car would kick up on one
side. They would run away from anything at the time.''
   Only 50 Tuckers, with a pricetag of $2,450, were made in 1948
before the big three automakers _ Ford, General Motors and Chrysler
_ allegedly conspired to torpedo the vehicle dubbed the ``Car of
Tomorrow Today.'' There are a surprising 45 left.
   Barrett, whose collector-car auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., last
Janurary brought in a record $32 million with the sale of 1,000
cars, said the Tucker is one of the most sought-after vehicles.
He's owned and sold seven Tuckers.
   ``For an American car built after World War II, the Tucker is
the most collectible in the world,'' he said.
   The most popular car overall right now is a 1964 Ferarri GTO,
which goes for about $3 million. Next is the Tucker, followed by
the 1955 Ford Thunderbird, 1957 Cadillac Eldorado and 1957
Chevrolet, he said.
   Barrett, however, still raved about the Tucker. ``The design was
way ahead of its time. They were way ahead of themselves. It is too
bad they got shut down,'' Barrett said.
   Safety features included pop-out windshields made of safety
glass, a crash board protection cowl in case of a head-on crash and
the center-mounted cyclops headlamp that moved with the steering
wheel.
   ``That was very unusual at the time, and still is, but it was
very clever when you are going into a turn,'' said Barrett.
   ``The rear-engine allowed tremendous room inside. You could sit
four people abreast in one seat. It was a huge car, about 18 feet
bumper-to-bumper.''
   But the Tucker is a four-wheeled relic that will be quickly
forgotten once the movie-hype has passed, said Cole, whose Monterey
Sports and Racing Car Auction on Aug. 19 is one of California's
largest.
   ``I wasn't interested in Tuckers before the movie and I'm not
interested after the movie, either,'' said Cole, adding there are
no Tuckers in his lineup.
   ``A guy called me last week and offered to sell me his Tucker
for $250,000. I told him I'd pass,'' said Cole. ``I'm sure I'll get
another call. As soon as the movie comes out, the phone will ring.''

   Several of the stars in the new movie
``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' were groomed in this southern
Kansas town where wheat is more often a conversation topic than
Hollywood.
   The stars are the 1948 Tucker automobiles.
   Stan Gilliland of the Tucker Automobile Club of America is the
owner of an antique auto restoration business, worked on virtually
all 22 cars used in the movie. In 1973, he staged an organizational
meeting for the club, which now has 210 members, most of whom don't
own Tuckers. He has owned as many as six at a time.
   Hailed as a revolutionary high-powered car, only 50 Tuckers were
made in a Chicago plant where B-29 engines once were built by
Dodge. The autos were engineering prototypes, not production cars,
and no two are alike, Gilliland said.
   In tests, a Tucker powered by its flat six-cyliner 335 cubic
inch engine reached 130 miles per hour. Preston T. Tucker
encouraged employees who test drove his cars to log as many miles
as possible at 100 mph. Gilliland and other club members have
driven them faster than that.
   Probably the most distinctive appearance feature of the car was
its hood-mounted third headlight that turned with the front wheels.
That, and its low, sleek body design captured postwar imaginations
hungry for something new.
   Tucker raised $30 million to make the auto, which he planned to
sell for around $2,500, a price competitive with cars of the day.
   That is also the price Coppola paid 18 Tucker owners to use
their cars for filming. He also utilized his two Tuckers and two
owned by producer George Lucas.
   The movie finally gives Tucker the fair treatment he didn't get
when he sought to manufacture what he called ``America's First
Completely New Car in 50 Years.''
   Coppola portrays Tucker as a hero who stood against the Big
Three automakers (Ford, General Motors and Chrysler), but went
bankrupt after a lengthy Securities Exchange Commission
investigation and a criminal trial that ended in his aquittal.
Tucker died of cancer in 1956.
   ``The automobile makers just couldn't stand for anybody to bring
out a new car,'' Gilliland said. ``I'm not saying there was for
sure a conspiracy, but there was a lot of funny stuff going on.''
   Tucker antagonists pictured him as a high-living con man who
never intended to actually manufacture cars. Supporters saw him as
visionary whose innovations such as disc brakes, padded dash, and
rear-mounted aluminum alloy engine, eventually were adopted by the
Detroit automakers.
   Walker began his fascination with the cars while still a
schoolboy. He read a December 1946 Science Illustrated magazine
article about Tucker's plans for the car.
   He finally got to see one when he sneaked under a sideshow tent
at the Kansas State Fair a few years after Tucker's bankruptcy. In
college, he wrote a freshman term paper titled ``The Startling
Story of the Tucker.''

   The jolt applied to interest rates by the
Federal Reserve singed financial markets again, as traders from
Tokyo to Wall Street sweated over the prospects for a global
interest-rate spiral.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 44.99 points
Wednesday to close at 2,034.14.
   The Fed's half-percentage-point hike in the discount rate
Tuesday to 6.5 percent created ``worry on a worldwide basis that

   Farmers Group Inc. has responded cooly to a
sweetened $5 billion friendly takeover bid from Batus Inc., and
Batus has pledged to continue a hostile bid for the insurer if
management refuses to negotiate.
   Batus boosted its cash offer for a negotiated merger from $63 a
share to $72 a share on Tuesday and gave management until Aug. 19
to respond.
   Farmers announced Wednesday it would study the offer with an eye
to the best interests of shareholders, but Treasurer Jerry Faulwell
hinted the higher price was unlikely to overcome management
opposition to the Batus bid.

   Insilco Corp. has disclosed it received
several unsolicited buyout offers since a management-led group's
$950 million bid for the high-technology and specialty consumer
products company last week.
   Insilco did not identify the parties involved in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, but said it
had entered into confidentiality agreements with certain groups.
   Last Thursday, Insilco's board of directors approved a
$29-a-share management offer in what some analysts described as an

   Printer R.R. Donnelley & Sons has fired three
more production workers it believes helped leak advance copies of
an influential Business Week column to a stockbroker, a company
official said.
   A spokesman for the printer said Wednesday that Donnelley had
exhausted all its leads but was continuing to cooperate with a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
   The firings late last week of three workers at Donnelley's Old

   The Federal Aviation Administration has begun
moving to suspend a $3.6 billion contract awarded to International
Business Machines Corp. to build an air traffic control system,
following a government decision to review the contract award.
   ``The FAA is in the process of drafting a stop work order'' that
effectively would suspend the contract, spokesman John Laden said
Wednesday.
   Hughes Aircraft, which lost out to IBM on the contract, last
week asked the government to revoke the contract. Hughes alleged
that IBM was allowed to undercut Hughes' bid partly because in
accepting IBM's offer the government included the use of used
computers. Hughes had agreed to use new computers.

   Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose in July from

   Economists said Wednesday it was too soon to conclude that the
steady shrinkage in Japan's surplus had come to an end, and they
noted that the surplus with the United States declined again.
   But some said Japanese companies have been raising export prices

   Continued uncertainty over the potential impact
of the recently announced Iran-Iraq cease fire has helped to steady
crude oil futures prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 3 cents to finish Wednesday at $15.71 per barrel.
The contract had declined 19 cents on Tuesday.
   The September contract for heating oil, which fell 0.43 cent in
the previous session, finished up 0.08 cent at 44.15 cents a
gallon. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery settled down 0.58
cent at 45.57 cents on the exchange, after falling 0.50 cent on
Tuesday.
   James R. Steele, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., said
fundamental changes were starting to affect the refined-crude
products Wednesday.
   ``The driving season is basically over and industrial users are
looking more to buy heating oil than gas now,'' he said. ``From now
until September, users of heating oil will be stockpiling it for
the winter.''
   Steele said the crude market remained confused over U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's announcement that Iran
and Iraq would begin a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war on Aug.
20.
   ``One school of thought says ... this will ultimately make OPEC
more cohesive,'' he said. ``The other school says that once they
stop fighting both countries will need to pump as much oil as they
can to rebuild their economies.''
   Oil prices have been declining in recent months amid speculation
that some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were exceeding their official production quotas and were
unlikely to soon reach an agreement to limit production.

   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose in the
government's latest auction to the highest level in nearly three
years.
   The average yield was 9.27 percent on Wednesday, up from 9.06
percent at the last auction on May 11.
   It was the highest rate since 10-year notes averaged 9.54
percent on Nov. 21, 1985. The notes will carry a coupon interest
rate of 9.25 percent, with each $10,000 in face value selling for
$9,987.10.
   A total of $11.0 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$20.4 billion.
   Wednesday's auction was the second part of the Treasury's
quarterly refunding. On Thursday, the government plans to auction
$7 billion in 248-day cash management bills in minimum
denominations of $10,000.
   On Tuesday, the Treasury sold $11.1 billion in three-year notes
at an average yield of 8.77 percent, up from 8.23 percent at the
last auction on May 10. It was the highest rate since August 1985.

   Growing American Airlines is beefing up its
presence in South Florida, home of its shrinking,
financially-troubled rival Eastern Airlines.
   Robert W. Baker, senior vice president for operations of the
carrier, announced plans Wednesday for a crew base of up to 700
pilots and flight attendants in Miami.
   ``American Airlines is deeply committed to the Florida market
and believes Florida will play a critical role in our future
expansion,'' Baker said.
   Fort Worth, Texas-based American's expansion in South Florida is
based on long-term plans and on expectations that the Florida and
Caribbean markets will continue growing, not on the potentially
temporary problems of competitors, Baker said.
   ``...The specific and well-known problems of Eastern really had
very little to do with our decision,'' Baker said.
   But he added the expansion in Miami would ``give us some
additional flexibility'' in case of such opportunities as
availability of Latin American routes currently flown by Eastern or
Pan American World Airways, both of which are seeking labor
cutbacks to avoid service reductions.
   ``I don't think it will have any effect,'' Eastern spokeswoman
Paula Musto said of American's move. ``American is in a growing
mode, and if Miami is their choice, I say more power to the Miami
community and economy.''
   Eastern has some 850 pilots and 1,800 flight attendants based
here, she said.
   U.S. District Court Judge Barrington Parker on Tuesday extended
until Aug. 26 a restraining order prohibiting Eastern from
dismissing about 4,000 workers as part of a cost-saving measure. He
planned to hear arguments today in Washington.
   Eastern, which has lost about $1 billion over the past 10 years,
posted a second quarter net loss of $89.8 million, compared with
net income of $27.1 million a year earlier. Eastern's revenue in
the most recent quarter declined to $1 billion from $1.2 billion.
   The Eastern plan, announced July 22, also calls for elimination
of 140 of its 1,225 daily flights to help cut costs.
   The plan would end nearly all operations at Kansas City,
Eastern's principal hub for the western United States, and
dramatically reduce flights at its Philadelphia hub. Flights to 14
cities also would be dropped under the plan.
   American also announced addition of a flight attendant crew base
in Nashville, Tenn., one of its five hubs. American said it would
staff the new base with 75 flight attendants in October and perhaps
as many as 600 in the early 1990s.
   American also has hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago,
Raleigh-Durham and San Juan.
   By January, American will base 160 flight crew members in Miami,
Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Baker said. The total will
reach 700 within a few years, he said.
   The expansion reflects a rise in flights that already was under
way, they said, and will help in expansion to the Caribbean Basin
that began with establishment of a hub in Puerto Rico about 1{
years ago.
   In two years, American had increased its daily flights in
Florida from 29 to 78 and boarded nearly 1 million passengers in
Florida in the first six months of 1988, compared to 412,000 the
first half of 1986.

   The dollar fell against major currencies this
morning in nervous trading after the German finance minister said a
rise in the dollar to more than 1.90 Deutsche marks would be
``problematic.''
   Gold prices rose.
   The dollar fell to 1.8950 marks shortly after Gerhard
Stoltenberg's statement, then recovered a bit, but remained below
late Wednesday's 1.9155-mark rate.
   Traders said the market was extremely nervous, wondering whether
central banks would follow up on the statement with intervention.
   But one trader in Rome added that the market had shown quite a
bit of resilience to Stoltenberg's comments. ``The market is still
a buyer of dollars,'' he said.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7015, compared
with $1.6910 Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8975 West German marks, down from
1.9155; 1.5875 Swiss francs, down from 1.5995; 6.4260 French
francs, down from 6.4780; 2.1445 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1655;
1,406.00 Italian lire, down from 1,414.00; and 1.2218 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2273.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.85 yen to a closing 134.07 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted lower at 133.65 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.50 a troy ounce, up
from late Wednesday's $428.25. At mid-morning Wednesday, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $429.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $429, up from $427 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.77 to close at a bid $431.79.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.70 a troy
ounce, up slightly from Wednesday's $6.67.

   Share prices bounced back today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange from a major drop the day before, while the U.S. dollar
declined sharply against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which plunged
615.49 points Wednesday _ the largest single-day drop in eight
months _ regained 230.11 points, or 0.83 percent, to close at
27,784.98.
   ``There is still a strong bullish sentiment in the Tokyo
market,'' said a dealer at a Tokyo brokerage, speaking anonymously.
``Investors who had been sidelined because of a lack of incentives
to participate in the market are buying depressed shares today
without hesitation.''
   Securities dealers said the stock market overcame negative signs
in New York overnight, including the 45-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average and the sudden downturn of the U.S. dollar.
   They also said activity was centered around strong buying of
large-capital shares by institutional investors who were taking
advantage of Wednesday's drop.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 600
million shares compared to 700 million Wednesday.
   The dollar, meanwhile, opened at 133.65 yen, or 1.27 yen lower
than Wednesday's 134.92 close. It moved in a range of 133.50-134.13
yen before closing at 134.07 yen, down 0.85 yen from Wednesday's
close.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's sudden downturn to fierce
profit-taking by investment banks, which bought the dollar at the
135-yen level Wednesday in New York.
   However, they said traders began buying dollars in the afternoon
session, which slightly raised the price of the dollar toward the
end of the day's trading.
   ``The low opening is apparently a carry-over from New York, but
profit-taking is pushing the dollar higher,'' said a Tokyo-based
dealer at a U.S. investment bank, also speaking anonymously.
   ``But no major shift is likely as the market awaits next week's
U.S. trade report,'' he added.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release U.S. trade
figures for June on Monday in Washington.

   Toshiba Machine Co., whose illegal exports to the
Soviet Union drew sharp criticism from the West last year, said
today it will cut its American operations in the face of
restrictions on its U.S. exports.
   ``We understand it is only a matter of time now that the (U.S.
trade) bill will be signed and take effect,'' said Hiroshi
Yamaguchi, the company's senior spokesman. ``So, whether we like it
or not, we will have to trim down the U.S unit sooner or later.''
   If President Reagan signs the omnibus trade bill as expected,
Toshiba Machine, which makes and sells machine tools, will be
barred from exporting to the United States for three years.
   The United States moved to penalize Toshiba Machine for selling
milling machines to the Soviet Union that could be used to build
quieter submarine propellers.
   The sophisticated machines are prohibited from sale to Soviet
bloc countries by an international agreement of the Paris-based
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.
   Reagan is expected to sign the bill as early as next week.
   Toshiba Machine's wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Toshiba Machine
Co., America, based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Villege, has
sales and maintenence responsibilities in the United States. It has
85 employees, 55 of them locally hired, and offices in Los Angeles,
New York and Toronto, Canada.
   ``We will try to protect the interests of our locally hired
peple as much as possible,'' said Yamaguchi. ``But eventually, the
sales function of the U.S. unit will inevitably be removed because
we won't be able to sell in the U.S. for three years.''
   Exports to the United States accounted for 12.2 percent of
Toshiba Machine's sales in fiscal 1987. The company expects a sharp
decline in its exports to the United States for the current fiscal
year, which began in April, but its total sales will likely
increase because of brisk domestic demand, Yamaguchi said.
   The U.S. trade bill also bars Toshiba Machine's parent, the
electronic giant Toshiba Corp., from sales to the U.S. government
for three years for poor supervision of its subsidiary.

<TEXT>
   The federal government's 4.4 million civilian
and military employees would receive a 4.1 percent pay increase
starting Jan. 1 under an agreement by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   President Reagan, who had recommended a 2 percent increase for
civilian workers and a 4.3 percent hike for the military, is
expected to approve the raise after final congressional action on
the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill which authorizes it.
   The $4 billion total cost of the 1989 raise _ which will hike
the salary of the highest-paid career civil servant from $77,500 to
$80,775 _ is to be absorbed by agency budgets already approved or
nearing approval.
   The pay raise measure was relatively noncontroversial because
members of Congress were among 5,000 top officials excluded. Also
excluded were federal judges and Cabinet secretaries, deputy
secretaries, and directors and undersecretaries of the departments
and major agencies.
   However, the conferees decided at the last minute to give the
raise to 7,000 members of the Senior Executive Service, the
top-ranking career employees.

<HEAD>FAO Projects Decline in World Grain Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World grain production is projected to decline for
the second consecutive year as a result of the drought in North
America, causing stocks to plunge at a record rate, the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization reported Thursday.
   Although widespread rain in July provided some relief, it only
averted further deterioration of the corn and spring wheat crops,
which had already suffered severe losses, the agency said in its
August issue of Food Outlook.
   The report said FAO's forecast of 1988 world grain production
has been lowered further to 1.772 billion metric tons, down 24
million tons from the previous year and 13 million tons from last
month's forecast.
   As a result of the production shortfall, world grain stocks are
projected by FAO to fall by 80 million tons in 1988-89, the biggest
annual drop on record, the report said.
   At the projected level, global stocks at the end of the 1988-89
marketing year would be at the minimum level FAO considers
necessary to safeguard food security.
   FAO has said the reduced stocks could cause food shortages in
some developing countries.
   The reduction since last month has been mostly in the production
forecast for coarse grains, which is now put at 772 million tons
against the earlier forecast of 785 million tons and last year's
harvest of 819 million tons, the report said. The forecast for
wheat has been lowered by 4 million tons to 516 millions tons, the
same as the below-trend 1987 output.
   In contrast, the production forecast for rice has been raised by
4 million tons to 484 million tons, which would be some 23 million
tons or 5 percent above the drought-reduced harvest of 1987, FAO
said.

<HEAD>Sears President To Retire In December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears Roebuck and Co., has announced that Edward
A. Brennan will become president of the giant retail, insurance and
financial services company when the current president retires at
the end of the year.
   Brennan will replace Richard M. Jones, president of Sears since
1986, who will retire on Dec. 31, the company said Wednesday.
   Brennan also will remain chairman of the Chicago-based company.
   Brennan said Jones, 61, a 38-year veteran of Sears, was ``the
primary architect'' of the company's ``dynamic, cost-effective
capital structure.''
   ``His vision has given us world-class financial management
capability and his counsel has been instrumental in enabling us to
efficiently finance the growth of Sears' diversified business,''
Brennan said.
   Jones, a native of Eldon, Mo., joined Chicago-based Sears in
1950 in Kankakee, Ill., and ascended through the corporate ranks to
become vice president of finance in 1980. He was named vice
chairman and chief financial officer before becoming president two
years ago.

<HEAD>Finance Ministers Issues Cautions on Dollar Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said Thursday that a further increase in the dollar's
value could lead to higher West German interest rates.
   Stoltenberg said that was only one of the possible negative
consequences of a dollar rise above the then-current level of about
1.90 marks.
   The finance minister said that a rise above 1.90 would be
``problematic.''
   At a news conference in Bonn, the West German finance minister
declined to say what actions the seven major non-communist
industrialized nations, known as the G-7, might take to prevent a
further dollar increase.
   But he said the G-7 finance ministers and central bankers were
not planning any meeting to discuss the issue in the near future.
   After Stoltenberg spoke, the dollar fell against major
currencies in nervious trading.

<HEAD>London Shares Drop Sharply After Early Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices surrendered their early gains and
fell sharply by midday Thursday on renewed jitters about the course
of global interest rates and prospects for overseas markets.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 10.2
points, or 0.6 percent to 1,829.7 at about 12:30 p.m.
   The index moved in positive territory for most of the morning,
rising as much as 6.3 points.
   Volume was moderate at 270.3 million shares compared with 239.6
million shares at the same time Wednesday.
   Shares traded higher at the outset of business, helped by a
rally in Tokyo stocks earlier Thursday and gains in U.S. bond
prices during Japanese trading.
   But British equities turned suddenly lower shortly before
midday, largely in response to drops in other markets, dealers said.
   One dealer said expectations were dampened that Wall Street
would show a significant recovery later Thursday after its rout on
Wednesday.
   The morning's brief respite from the interest rate worries that
plagued the market on Wednesday allowed individual stocks to
respond to corporate news.
   The major mover was Shell Transport and Trading Co. PLC, which
plunged 35 pence (60 cents) to 10.19 pounds ($17.32) after its
parent company, Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies, reported a 4
percent drop in its second-quarter net profit.
   Shares in British Petroleum Co PLC, due to announce its results
later Thursday, were unchanged at 256 pence ($4.35).

   Citizens from housewives to factory
workers are scraping together whatever cash they can and invading
brokerages to join in an investment craze triggered by the
spectacular boom of the local stock market.
   But while the craze has conjured up dreams of instant wealth, it
also has some experts warning of a possible nightmare when the
heated market cools down.
   Brokerage trading rooms have been crowded with office and
factory workers, retired civil servants, housewives and others
anxious to play the market despite official warnings that prices
might soon tumble.
   ``The market is real hot. Many factory owners have to come to
brokerage houses to snatch their employees back to work,'' Su
San-ho, a stock manager at the Well Phones Securities Co. in the
port city of Kaohsiung, 216 miles south of Taipei, said during a
recent interview.
   Taiwan's stock index posted seven consecutive record highs
through Tuesday, when it surpassed 7,000 points for the first time
ever. It managed another record close on Wednesday despite a
615-point plunge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, but closed sharply
lower today on profit-taking sparked by the declines in overseas
markets.
   The index has soared more than 200 percent so far this year and
35 percent in just the past month.
   Stockbrokers on Nanking East Road, nicknamed Wall Street for its
many brokerages and business firms, have hung huge red balloons
imprinted with the latest stock index showing outside the buildings.
   ``It is unbelievable,'' said John Nelson, an analyst of Jardine
Fleming Taiwan Ltd. ``No one seems to have a good reason for this
incredible rise.''
   Share trading volume zoomed to $116 billion in the first seven
months of this year, a 214 percent increase from the same period
last year.
   The accumulated figure was the fourth-largest in the world after
the Tokyo, New York and London exchanges, according to Jardine
Fleming.
   Many Taiwan companies have set aside a fund for stock
investments, in which profits are shared with employees to prevent
them from sneaking away from work to the brokerage floors, brokers
say.
   They say some office workers even have quit their jobs, figuring
that in two weeks time playing the market they can earn more than
their annual income, which averages about $10,500.
   Several local consulting firms forecast the stock index would
hit 8,000 or 10,000 points by the end of this year.
   But Chen Pao-rei, an economist at the government Council for
Economic Planning and Development, recently warned: ``Share prices
cannot continue to surge without an end. The higher the prices
rise, the sharper the fall may be.''
   Wu Jung-yi, professor of economics of National Chunghsing
University, said the overheated market is ``an irregular
phenomenon'' that could lead to ``share prices falling like
dominoes.''
   Analysts say the latest surge began in mid-July when the ruling
Nationalist Party convened a landmark congress in which it decided
to lift import bans on major raw materials from rival mainland
China.
   The congress was quickly followed by a Cabinet overhaul in which
several aging economic officials were replaced by a younger group,
in a move seen as a precursor to reforming Taiwan's restrictive
financial system.
   This island's robust economic growth also is viewed as a key
factor behind the rising share prices. But analysts note that
Taiwan's economic performance appears to be slowing and should not
have boosted the market to such heights.
   The government projects a 7 percent economic growth for this
year, down from the 1987 rate of 11 percent.
   John Chien, president of the U.S.-based Federated International
Investment Consulting Co., believes share prices have shot up
because ``too many cash-rich people are chasing too few stocks.''
   The local exchange lists only 145 companies. The relatively
small market allows manipulation by major investors, who pushed
certain share prices up before selling for huge profits, analysts
say.
   Another factor contributing to the overheated market is the 3
percent daily gain and loss limit authorities imposed on share
prices. The limits, designed to prevent drastic price surges or
tumbles, have prompted speculation by reducing investment risk,
analysts say.
   The government in June tightened credit in an effort to dampen
rampant stock and real estate speculation, but to little effect.
``Credit is a little tighter but money is still abundant
everywhere,'' said Chien.

   Polaroid Corp. directors reportedly are expected
to tell shareholders and employees Friday that an offer to sell the
company to Shamrock Holding Inc. for $40 a share is not enough.
   The directors also do not consider Shamrock's offer to be
legally binding because it was subject to several conditions, The
Boston Globe today said it was told by unidentified sources.
   The rejection would be supported by an evaluation from Shearson
Lehman Hutton, Polaroid's investment banker, and the opinion of
some directors that the value of the stock depends partly on the
amount of damages the Eastman Kodak Co. pays Polaroid for patent
infringement.
   ``We have no way of knowing whether Kodak will pay $500 million
or $3 billion to $4 billion, so the value of Polaroid shares is
uncertain,'' a source is quoted as saying.
   Lawyers for both companies prepared to discuss a schedule for
the damages trial with U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone today.
Polaroid shares sold for 42[ Wednesday.

<HEAD>County Acquires Abandoned Mills For Redevelopment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two abandoned steel mills that have become
public property will be turned into industrial parks and
recreational areas in an attempt to draw employers and jobs to the
depressed Monongahela River Valley.
   ``We want to make sure all the talents we have in the Mon Valley
are fully utilized,'' said Tom Foerster, chairman of the Allegheny
County commissioners.
   The directors of the county's Industrial Development Authority
signed an agreement with USX Corp. on Wednesday to transfer the
Duquesne Works in Duquesne and National Works in McKeesport to the
authority.
   The deal culminated two years of work that began before similar
recommendations were made in March by urban planners and architects
who visited the area as part of an international Remaking Cities
Conference.
   ``The county is taking a risk. Our neck is way out on the line
because now it's up to the county to develop that property,''
Foerster said. ``We thought it's time government took a risk.''
   The private Regional Industrial Development Corp. will oversee
the mills' demolition, a task expected to take three years. As each
section is razed, it will be redeveloped as quickly as possible,
said Stephen M. Barrouk, executive director of the county authority.
   ``It's not going to happen overnight, but it's going to
happen,'' Barrouk said.
   Jim Taylor, chairman of the Mon Valley Commission, which
recommended the sales agreement in a 1987 report, said he's
received numerous inquiries from businesses interested in moving
into the planned industrial parks. He declined to elaborate but
said numerous jobs likely will be created.
   USX sold the two plants, including land, buildings and
equipment, for $3,662,800, or $10,000 an acre, to be paid by
promissory note. The county will repay to USX at least that much
per acre when parcels are sold or leased.
   The county authority and the Regional Industrial Development
Corp. will share responsibility for removing any hazardous wastes
identified by a planned environmental survey.
   Any hazardous wastes found later will be cleaned at public
expense, up to $3 million. USX would pay half of any costs above $3
million, said authority solicitor Scott Irmscher.
   Removing known deposits of asbestos and other hazardous wastes
will cost about $14 million, with the sale of scrap metal expected
to easily cover the cost, Imscher said.
   USX will reserve about 20 acres of the 380-acre sites under a
leaseback arrangement for an annual rental of $1 for 10 years. Over
the next decade, the company can repurchase all or any part of that
area for $1 plus improvement costs.
   USX will continue to make payments to the county, local
municipalities and school districts in lieu of real estate taxes
following the anticipated closing in mid-September.
   ``There's a good chance that if we do it correctly and everybody
cooperates that it will be successful,'' Taylor said.
   ``The changes that we make in these communities are for the next
century,'' Barrouk said. ``So we can't afford not to do it right.''

<HEAD>Trade in Endangered Species Up in Holiday Season, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal trade in endangered or protected wildlife
such as crocodiles, parrots and chimpanzees represents an estimated
$1.5 billion annually, an official responsible for enforcing an
international treaty protecting such species said Thursday.
   Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer
and Christmas holiday seasons because customs officials are often
overloaded and illegal shipments slip past them, Jean-Patrick Le
Duc told a news conference.
   Also, at Christmas, live animals``make good presents,'' he said.
In Europe, for example, parrots and reptiles including baby
crocodiles are increasingly popular pets, he said.
   Le Duc is an enforcement official for the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
The convention, in force since July 1975, has been ratified by 95
countries, including the United States, most Latin American
countries except Mexico, and many Asian, African and European
nations.
   It aims to prevent international trade from threatening species
with extinction. Signatories are to enforce bans on commercial
trade in an agreed list of currently endangered species and to
regulate trade in others that might become endangered.
   According to CITES, endangered species include: all apes; the
giant panda; many South American monkeys; the Asian elephant; all
rhinoceroses; many birds of prey and parrots; all sea turtles; some
crocodiles; great whales. No permits are issued for international
trade in these species except under unusual circumstances.
   Le Duc said total trade, legal and illegal, in wildlife amounts
to $5 billion annually. He estimated that illegal trade is ``about
30 percent'' of the total.
   The hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are Southeast Asia,
Japan, Latin America and Africa, though Africa is doing more than
any other developing country to try to control it, Le Duc said.
   To give an idea of how lucrative wildlife trade can be, Le Duc
said a trader could buy a gray parrot in Ghana for about $10 and
resell it for about $600 in North America.
   A press release from CITES headquarters in Lausanne listed 10
examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in the past 10
weeks.
   In one, ``a notorious, convicted animal trader'' sent crates
with live animals from Equatorial Guinea destined for Honduras via
Spain, the report said.
   It said that customs agents stopped the shipment at the Madrid
airport. In the crates they found five chimpanzees, 12 crocodiles,
nine Mandrill monkeys, 11 Agama lizards, seven tortoises, 17
Saimiri monkeys and 31 gray parrots. Several of the animals were
found dead. The surviving animals were given to the Madrid Zoo, the
report said.
   In two other separate cases, a total of 8,000 baby crocodiles
were shipped from Colombia to Taiwan, it says. One shipment of
2,000 was discovered because of the stench of some 1,500 that had
died.
   And recently, a female Asian elephant arrived in the Dutch port
of Rotterdam from Vietnam ``hidden in a large crate.'' Her skin had
dried up during the one-month journey, and she was ``in a pitiful
state,'' it said. The elephant survived and now is at Rotterdam Zoo.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $1.29 Million In GM Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district court jury has awarded a
Montana man $1.29 million after finding General Motors Corp. at
fault because a 4-wheel-drive pickup truck rolled over him while he
was working on it.
   The verdict represents the first case nationally where the
4-wheel-drive design used by GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
between 1973 and 1979 has been challenged at trial, said Dennis
Conner of Great Falls, Krueger's lawyer.
   The jury said the truck was defective and caused the injuries
that paralyzed him.
   Jurors deliberated about five hours Tuesday night and Wednesday
before reaching a unanimous verdict. The jury found that an
open-differential design in the 1976 Chevrolet pickup's transfer
case was unreasonably dangerous and that the automaker failed to
warn consumers.
   The jury said both failures contributed to Andrew Krueger's
injuries in the Feb. 17, 1983, accident.
   The jury ruling not only ends five years of legal efforts by
Krueger but also ``we now have a verdict here in Montana that says,
`This product is unreasonably dangerous' and that they have failed
to warn,'' the lawyer said.
   ``That has to have implications that reach all the way back ...
to Detroit,'' Conner said.
   The jury found no liability by Krueger for his injuries.
   Curtis Thompson, a defense lawyer, said the defense team was
assessing options such as post-trial motions and possibly an appeal.
   The verdict ended a two-week trial before District Judge Thomas
McKittrick.
   The trial centered on the full-time four-wheel-drive design used
on GM's and other automakers' vehicles between 1973 and 1979. The
plaintiffs sought to show the open-differential design in the
transfer case of the four-wheel drive defectively allowed a vehicle
that was stopped and in the park gear to roll if one wheel were
jacked up or the driveshaft dropped.
   Krueger was injured in the accident on a sloping driveway in
Great Falls. An unemployed man with about five years' experience as
a mechanic, Krueger was paralyzed from the upper chest down after
he slipped under his borrowed full-time four-wheel-drive pickup and
disconnected its front driveshaft.
   The vehicle was set on park and four-wheel drive, though Krueger
had not blocked its wheels, used the parking brake nor put
four-wheel drive in the lock position.

   Thousands of seals are dying on North
Sea beaches and environmentalists say pollution is the killer, but
scientists are not ready to blame a ``toxic cocktail'' they are
finding in the carcasses.
   An estimated 7,000 diseased harbor seals have died since April,
about half the population in the North Sea waters of West Germany,
the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
   West German television gives the death count nearly every night
and shows closeups of carcasses being loaded onto trucks to be
hauled away for disposal. More than 2,000 of the seals have died in
West German waters.
   Governments, marine biologists and environmentalists agree the
North Sea is heavily polluted and the seals are dying of one or
more viruses. The cause of the disease remains unknown.
   Thousands of West Germans demonstrating concern formed a 25-mile
human chain July 24 that stretched the length of Sylt Island.
   Earlier this summer, Greenpeace environmentalists tried to stop
an incinerator ship from burning burning Spanish toxic waste in the
North Sea.
   Two Greenpeace activists tried to board the 3,356-ton Vulcanus
II about 100 miles from Britain on June 21, but crew members using
high-pressure water hoses knocked them into the sea and damaged the
Breenpeace vessel.
   Environmentalists call the seal epidemic one of the worst
ecological disasters ever.
   ``This really shows that society is not taking care of the
environment,'' Claudia Sieg, Hamburg spokeswoman for Greenpeace,
said in a telephone interview.
   Greenpeace and other environmental groups hold pollution
responsible for the epidemic and demand that industry take
immediate measures to stop it.
   Independent scientists say the hypothesis has not been proven.
They also are uncertain about consequences for other forms of
marine life.
   ``We have found a huge cocktail of different toxic agents in
these seals but we have not yet seen any direct connections between
pollution and the disease,' said Guenter Heidemann, an expert on
seals at the University of Kiel.
   Heidemann added, however, that he suspects highly toxic
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other chemicals have increased
the susceptibility of harbor seals to disease.
   Many North Sea beaches are considered unhealthy for swimmers
because of manmade wastes.
   Greenpeace says the Rhine, Elbe and Weser, all German rivers,
carry more than 450,000 tons of phosphates and nitrates, 100 tons
of lead and 50 tons of mercury into the North Sea every year.
   Scientists have found fish on Sylt's eastern shore with tumors
and lesions believed caused by pollutants spewed into the sea by
the Rhine and other rivers.
   Officials and independent experts say pollution in the Rhine is
far less serious than 15 years ago because of improved treatment
plants, but they acknowledge that Swiss, West German, French and
Dutch factories and communities still dump waste into the river.
   Oil is another source of North Sea pollution. Experts say about
400,000 tons of it leak into the sea each year from offshore
drilling rigs and other sources.
   Fertilizer runoff from farmland adds to the pollution load, say
scientists in the North Sea nations, but they cannot about the
effect of pollution on seal life.
   Norwegian scientists have speculated that seal overpopulation
may have increased their susceptibility to viral infections.
Swedish researcher Susanne Liljenstrom counters that the population
is much smaller than at the beginning of the century.
   Experts also argue over whether a single virus is causing the
epidemic.
   Gunnar Holt of Oslo's Veterinarian Institute, said he believes
the deaths are due to a virus called ``Picorna'' that ``has been
registered in seals before.''
   ``Now it seems as if researchers have found exactly the Picorna
virus which causes seal death,'' he said.
   Heidemann, the West German expert, responds: ``It is not known
if this virus is mainly responsible for the epidemic. Most of the
animals die from lung infection or from infection of the stomach
and gut system, but nobody knows what has really triggered these
developments.''
   Some put the blame on waste dumped by Britain and carried by
North Sea currents, but the British government says responsibility
lies with continental Europe.
   Whoever or whatever is to blame, the entire harbor seal
population may be in danger.
   ``At first we thought this would soon end, but no end is in
sight,'' Heidemann said. ``It is a possibility that most of these
animals might die.''

   Roger Rosenblatt will become the third editor
of U.S. News & World Report in the last four years, the weekly
magazine's owner and editor-in-chief has announced.
   Mortimer B. Zuckerman said in a statement Wednesday that he
selected Rosenblatt, a senior writer at the Washington-based
publication, to succeed David Gergen on Sept. 1. Gergen is assuming
the new position of editor-at-large.
   Gergen said the change will allow him to expand his role as
writer and be an active participant in public affairs television
programming the magazine intends to undertake.
   Rosenblatt, 47, joined U.S. News earlier this year after holding
a similar senior writing position with Time magazine since 1980. He
has been a Fulbright Scholar, director of education at the National
Endowment for the Humanities and a columnist for The Washington
Post.
   Zuckerman said he has admired Rosenblatt ``as a journalist and a
writer for many years.''
   He also praised Gergen ``for his outstanding service to the
magazine'' and said he looks forward to a ``continuing, close
relationship.''
   Gergen became editor of the magazine in 1986 and prior to that
was communications director for President Reagan.

<HEAD>GSA Order To Slow Down Air Traffic Contract, IBM Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
stopping work on a $3.6 billion air traffic control system
following a protest by a losing contractor.
   The protest by Hughes Aircraft earlier caused the General
Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals to suspend
procurement for the system being put together by International
Business Machines Corp. Hughes claims it should have gotten the
contract.
   The Advanced Automation System is ``a new generation of air
traffic control system ... where the computer is actually involved
in the decision making,'' said FAA spokesman John Laden. The
system, which is to be completed by the turn of the century, is
intended to improve air safety and reduce air controllers'
workloads.
   ``The FAA is in the process of drafting a stop work order,''
said Laden. ``The next step will be for the GSA to decide on the
merits of the protests.''
   Hughes last week asked the government to revoke the contract,
alleging that IBM was allowed to undercut Hughes' bid in part
because IBM's offer included the use of used computers. Hughes had
agreed to use new ones.
   ``We are pleased by the decision and are looking forward to
pleading the case on its merits,'' said Lee Pitt, a Hughes vice
president.
   The contract is the largest award in IBM's history.
   ``We maintain that the Hughes protest is without merit and
should be denied,'' said IBM spokesman Michael Dutton.
   While the contract board's action ``does not mean the contract
has been suspended'' said Dutton, ``it certainly is going to slow
down development of the system.''
   Additional hearings on the contract review are scheduled for
early next month.

   A government agency said Thursday it will
allow banks in Taiwan to issue credit cards in a move to liberalize
the island's financial system.
   The Council for Economic Planning and Development said the
decision was related to trade talks earlier this year with the
United States, which urged Taiwan to allow the issuance of credit
cards as part of a program to open financial markets.
   In a statement, the council said the international credit-card
business had become a necessity to Taiwan, which along with Hong
Kong, Singapore and South Korea, comprise the newly industrialized
powerhouses of Asia.
   ``This is something we've waited for for years,'' said Jacob
Chao, general manager of American Express International Inc. He
said his company had sought permisison to issue credit cards in
Taiwan for five years.

   Nippon Steel Corp. said Thursday it and other major
Japanese steelmakers are studying the feasibility of building an
integrated steel mill in China with an annual production capacity
of 3.5 million tons of crude steel.
   Junichi Imade of Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, said
the company was asked by China's Ministry of Metallurgical Industry
to build the plant in Shijiusuo, Shandong province, jointly with
China.
   Shijiusuo, which is along the Yellow Sea, is 600 kilometers (360
miles) southeast of the Chinese capital city of Beijing.
   Imade said Kensuke Koga, vice president of Nippon Steel, visited
China in late July to discuss financial aspects of the project,
which is estimated by the Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry to cost 600 billion yen ($4.4 billion).
   Imade declined to elaborate.
   However, he denied a Japanese press report that Nippon Steel and
other major steel makers have reached a basic agreement with China
on the project and that a formal agreement would be made during
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's visit to China late this month.

<HEAD>Threats by Homeless Cause HUD To Back Off Weekend Sales Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Threats of a lawsuit by homeless families
hoping to find shelter in foreclosed houses caused the federal
government to cancel a major sales promotion that was aimed at
selling 15,000 houses this weekend.
   Critics of the sale said it could have deprived the homeless of
possible living space and would mainly benefit speculators.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced
Wednesday it was calling off its ``coordinated national sales
weekend'' after advocates for the homeless threatened legal action.
The promotion was to include special advertising, open houses and
other activities to push sales of more than 27,000 houses in
several states which the federal government has taken over because
their owners couldn't meet payments on federal housing loans.
   The houses will remain on the market across the country, but
local HUD offices have been told not to proceed with the planned
sales effort because of the threatened lawsuit.
   Roberta Youmans of the National Housing Law Project praised the
action but said the group, which had threatened the lawsuit, still
would pursue ways of getting more foreclosed houses into the hands
of some of the three million Americans who have no place to live.
   ``We received calls from homeless individuals saying HUD was
selling units and they couldn't get them,'' Ms. Youmans said in a
telephone interview.
   She said the group, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., had
written HUD to object to the campaign and threaten a lawsuit. The
project assists lawyers helping indigent clients with housing cases.
   Ms. Youmans said many of the HUD sales result in homes being
sold to speculators, and sometimes the homes themselves have been
taken away from people who originally were homeless, putting them
back on the streets. Others are being rented to people who are
rendered homeless by the sales, she said.
   She said the group first heard about a plan to sell 150
foreclosed houses in the Washington, D.C., area later this month
and then discovered the planned nationwide campaign. The Washington
area effort also has been stopped.
   Ms. Youmans said homeless advocates plan to meet with HUD
officials to discuss ways the houses can be used to decrease
homelessness.
   Bill Glavin, a HUD spokesman, said the sales effort was stopped
``as a result of the threat of litigation by homeless advocacy
groups, since any protracted litigation could have an adverse
affect on the future sales of foreclosed properties.''
   He said the agency also was reviewing its programs for making
the houses available to the homeless. Both lease and lease-purchase
programs are available, and about 90 percent of the available
houses can be purchased at a 10 percent discount by local agencies
that would make them available to the homeless, HUD said in a
statement.
   Foreclosed government properties generally are available through
bids that are to be opened on a specific date for each property.

The measure provides ... Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed a $3.9-billion
drought-relief package today, telling farmers it ``isn't as good as
rain, but it will tide you over'' until normal weather returns.
   At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, Reagan said,
``This bill expresses a distinctive American tradition _ that of
lending a helping hand when misfortune strikes.''
   He said the measure was a product of bipartisanship, as members
of both parties in Congress saw that ``the need to help our farmers
rose far above any partisan politics.''
   ``This legislation is helpful and generous, but at the same time
it is not a budget buster,'' the president said.
   ``To ensure the continued success of this important bill, we
must stick to the principles I have outlined, targeting assistance
to the truly needy and emphasizing sound business decisions,'' he
said.
   Addressing the nation's farmers directly, the president said,
``This bill isn't as good as rain, but it will tide you over until
normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your
accustomed role of being the most productive farmers in the world.''
   The measure provides aid for farmers suffering crop losses of
more than 35 percent of their expected harvest because of the
drought or other calamities such as hail, insect damage or
excessive rain. The payments would be equal to 65 per cent of the
lost income.
   Farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 per cent of the expected
yield would receive payments equal to 90 per cent of lost income.
   ``It's a good buffer, and it's probably enough to get most
people over the hump this year,'' said Keith Salter, who figures he
will get $12,000 because the drought baked all 420 acres of wheat,
barley and oats on his farm near Menoken, N.D.
   ``It won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing,'' said
the 53-year-old farmer.
   The White House said Reagan would sign the bill in the White
House Rose Garden today. His signature already had been assured.
   Farm organization leaders said the bill _ the most expensive
disaster relief measure ever enacted for agriculture _ won't be
enough to keep all financially squeezed farmers in business.
   ``If a farmer has been struggling these past few years ... this
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest,'' said
John Leininger, spokesman for the 33,000-member North Dakota
Farmers Union. ``We are definitely going to see some farmers leave,
I am sure.''
   According to the Farmers Union, a farmer with an average wheat
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should
receive at least $42 an acre in disaster aid. The payment would go
up to about $92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance.
   The same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about $114
per acre, based on market prices this spring, Leininger said.
   Money for the payments is expected to come from savings that the
government will realize as a result of the drought, since
income-support payments are based in part on how much individual
farmers produce. With crops down because of the drought, the amount
the government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. must put out in such
payments is also down.
   Under the bill, farmers will not have to repay such payments
that they have received already if their payment amount is lowered
because of production losses resulting from the drought. They may
not, however, retain such payments for lost crops and still receive
disaster aid money for the same crops.
   Farmers will have to purchase federal crop insurance for 1989 to
be eligible for disaster payments.
   Livestock owners who have to buy feed because of the drought,
instead of growing it as usual, also would receive assistance.
   The bill places a limit of $100,000 on payments to any one
farmer. It prohibits payments to any producer whose ``qualifying
gross revenues,'' as set by a congressional formula, exceed $2
million.
   Many reports by private forecasters and commodity specialists
indicate a reduction of about 40 percent in this fall's corn
production from last year's 7.06 billion bushels and a 20 percent
to 25 percent decline in soybeans from the 1987 harvest of 1.91
billion bushels.
   The wheat crop also has been reduced, but not as greatly because
most of the wheat came from the winter crop, which was planted last
fall and harvested before the full impact of the drought was felt.

   The stock market showed no clear-cut trend
today, struggling to stabilize after its recent steep decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 44.99 points
on Tuesday, recovered 1.24 to 2,035.38 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.41 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushed
prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for
``bargains.''
   But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent
rise in interest rates.
   Several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from
9.5 percent to 10 percent, a day after the Federal Reserve
increased the rate it charges on loans to private financial
institutions.
   The timing of the Federal Reserve's increase in its discount
rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent suggested to many Wall Streeters
that the Fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becoming
more aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up.
   For one thing, the rate increase came just as the Treasury was
beginning a quarterly sale of debt securities.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher,
then turned narrowly mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade in
light trading ahead of this afternoon's Agriculture Department crop
production report.
   The USDA is expected to reduce its crop production estimates,
especially for corn and soybeans, to reflect crop damage wrought by
the summer-long drought.
   Observers generally expect the government to predict about a 40
percent decline in corn production and a 20 percent to 25 percent
drop in soybean production from last year's levels.
   But analysts said few traders were willing to gamble on the
government's numbers or on the market's reaction to the report,
which will be released at 3 p.m. EDT in Washington.
   ``We've talked about it to death. Now everybody's just standing
around and waiting for the report,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
in Chicago with the G.H. Miller Division of LIT America Inc., a
British-owned commodity trading company.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union had purchased 500,000 metric tons
of South American soybean meal provided some support for the
soybean complex, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1\ cents
higher with September at $3.00{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{
cents higher with September at $2.73 a bushel; and soybeans were 1
cent lower to { cent higher with August at $8.65 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .22 cent lower with August at
69.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .45 cent lower
with August at 81.10 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to .30
cent higher with August at 45.95 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .50 cent to .83 cent higher with August at 35.50 cents
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply higher on Wednesday.

   Royal Dutch-Shell Group, the world's largest oil
company, on Thursday reported second-quarter profits slipped 4
percent, while fourth-ranked British Petroleum Co. PLC saw net
income jump 12.6 percent during the period.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, based in the Netherlands and in London, said
its profits for the three months ended June 30 totaled 633 million
pounds, the equivalent of $1.17 billion, compared with 656 million
pounds.
   Accounting methods used by British companies put a different
value on inventories than methods used in the United States, which
makes direct comparisons difficult.
   Using the American accounting method, Royal Dutch-Shell's
after-tax profit rose 5 percent to 657 million pounds, or about
$1.2 billion, from 626 million pounds.
   Revenues fell 7 percent to 13.6 billion pounds, or $25 billion,
from 14.6 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The company said strong returns from its worldwide refining and
marketing operations failed to offset lower natural gas and crude
oil prices.
   For the first six months of the year, net income rose 8 percent
to 1.5 billion pounds, or $2.6 billion, from 1.35 billion pounds.
Under U.S. accounting methods, profits jumped 27 percent to 1.6
billion pounds, or $2.8 billion, from 1.2 billion pounds.
   Six-month revenues fell 6 percent to 27.2 billion pounds, or $50
billion, from 29 billion pounds.
   London-based BP, which owns Standard Oil Co. of Cleveland, said
second-quarter profits totaled 357 million pounds, the equivalent
of $655 million, up from 317 million pounds.
   Under U.S. accounting methods, profit surged 24.2 percent to 323
million pounds, or $596 million, from 260 million pounds.
   A strong performance by the company's petrochemical, refining
and marketing divisions helped boost earnings during the quarter.
   Revenues, however, fell 7 percent to 6.48 billion pounds, or
$11.9 billion, from 7 billion pounds.
   For the first six months, net income fell 20 percent to 620
million pounds, or $1.1 billion, from 775 million pounds. Under the
American accounting system, half-year profit rose 25 percent to 731
million pounds, or $1.3 billion, from 584 million pounds.
   BP, which ranks fourth after Royal Dutch-Shell, Exxon Corp. and
Mobil Corp., said revenues in the first two quarters fell 7 percent
to 13 billion pounds, or $24 billion, from 14 billion pounds.
   Dollar conversions were provided by the companies.

   In a nation that loves credit and, in fact, is
hooked on it, an increase in interest rates immediately falls into
the category of bad, even painful, news.
   Couples postpone buying homes, cars, appliances and trips.
Companies find their sales hurt. Lenders can't find qualified
borrowers. Uncle Sam, always in a bind, finds it even more
difficult to pay down his bills.
   Rising interest rates create a bad mood all around, because they
signal _ in fact, force _ an economic slowdown. Few people look at
whatever good higher interest rates might do, such as helping to
avert inflation.
   Among those least likely to see much good in the latest Federal
Reserve action is George Bush, the Republican presidential
candidate, because the VDI, or voter discomfort index, is now on
the rise.
   The VDI is a significant economic measure because it suggests
discontent with the incumbent party. It has nothing to do with
political fairness. It is not an in-depth measure of understanding,
but it suggests how people vote.
   As constructed by economist Albert H. Cox Jr., the VDI is made
up of the jobless rate, mortgage rates, inflation rate and growth
rate. The first three are added, and the fourth is then subtracted
from the total.
   In 1976, the year of President Carter's election, the VDI was
16.1, made up of a 7.7 percent jobless rate, 9 percent mortgage
rates, 4.8 percent inflation rate and 5.4 percent growth rate, the
latter based on gross national product.
   It was a high rate and rising _ it was only 10.9 in 1976 and as
low as 7 in 1964 _ which helped defeat the incumbent.
   By 1980 it was even higher, and rising. In fact, it had doubled
to 32.5. The job situation had improved a bit, but mortgage rates
and inflation were in double-digit areas, while economic growth had
almost ceased. The mood was blue.
   As everyone knows, Ronald Reagan rode into the White House on a
surge of votes, a consequence at least in part of the terrible VDI.
By 1984 the VDI was back down to 17.4, and Reagan was re-elected in
a landslide.
   The current VDI is just under 16, which means it has shown very
little improvement since 1984. The unemployment and mortgage
situations are better. Inflation is about the same. But economic
growth has been cut in half.
   In other words, says Cox, senior economic adviser of Bil,
Trainer Wortham Inc., favorable economic momentum is not evident if
the reference point is economic conditions before the last national
election.
   And now that the Federal Reserve has raised its basic interest
rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, the VDI may very well
deteriorate. While inflation still could worsen, economic growth
might slow.
   Cox observes that ``President Reagan made effective use of the
question: Are you better or worse off? Obviously, the answer to
that question was `much worse off' in 1980, and `much better off'
in 1984.''
   What would the answer be today? ``Neither, or not sure or don't
know,'' said Cox when he compiled his latest VDI. But that was
before the Fed raised interest rates. Today, the interpretation
would be even worse for Bush.
   The VDI doesn't tell it all. It is a record of existing
conditions and says nothing whatever about the ability of a
candidate to inspire voters and to portray a new and better
economic life. But it sets the mood.
   Says Cox: ``Economic momentum, both negative and positive, was a
powerful factor in President Reagan's big election victories. If he
were running again this year, he would not have that advantage. ...
and candidate Bush does not have that advantage.''

   Share prices slipped Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange after an uneven session.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 4.7
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,835.2. The closing level was between
its session peak of 1,846.2 and its low of 1,828.3.
   Trading volume was 465.4 million shares, compared with
Wednesday's 442.2 million shares.
   Several analysts said recent concerns over the impact of rising
interest rates may have been exaggerated.
   ``People are realizing that the fears that were swirling around
international markets earlier this week after the (U.S.) discount
rate hike were unjustified,'' said Ian Harwood, an economist at
Warburg Securities in London.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its discount rate by half a
point to 6.5 percent on Tuesday. On Thursday, several major U.S.
banks raised their prime rates to 10 percent from 9.5 percent.
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was off a modest
2.13 points at 2,032.01 as the London session drew to a close,
after opening higher.
   London dealers had been expecting a sharply lower start in New
York and were keeping a close eye on activity there to see if
shares would take another tumble after Wednesday's 44.99-point drop
on Wall Street.
   The London session began on a buoyant note because stock prices
had risen earlier in Tokyo where U.S. bond prices also rose.
   However, equities turned suddenly lower shortly before midday,
and dealers cited a disappointing earnings report from the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of Companies, which said its second-quarter net
profit was off 4 percent.
   Market watchers said there was no concerted selling pressure,
however.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 4.5 points to 1,477.6.
The Financial Times 500-share index fell 2.8 points to 1,047.96.

   Stock prices sagged again in an erratic session
today, struggling to stabilize after the market's recent recent
steep decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 44.99 points
on Tuesday, dropped 9.42 to 2,024.72 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 465 up, 909 down and
530 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushed
prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for
``bargains.''
   But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent
rise in interest rates.
   Several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from
9.5 percent to 10 percent, a day after the Federal Reserve
increased the rate it charges on loans to private financial
institutions.
   The timing of the Federal Reserve's increase in its discount
rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent suggested to many Wall Streeters
that the Fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becoming
more aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up.
   For one thing, the rate increase came just as the Treasury was
beginning a quarterly sale of debt securities.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines fell 1[ to 117}; General Electric [ to 40; Ford Motor } to
49{, and USX ] to 28|.
   Convergent Inc. jumped 2 7-16 to 5~ in the over-the-counter
market. Unisys Corp. agreed to acquire the company for $7 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .59 to 147.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .67 at 295.90.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 128.08 million shares with two
hours to go.

<TEXT>
   The head of research and development for
Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, the pharmaceutical division of
SmithKline Beckman Corp. has resigned.
   Stanley T. Crooke, 43, had been president of the division since
1982, after joining the pharmaceutical manufacturer in 1980. He
oversaw a budget of about $235 million, as well as the opening
several years ago of a new research facility in suburban
Philadelphia.
   The company said in a statement Wednesday that Crooke would be
replaced by George Poste, 44, a veterinarian and cancer researcher
who has been second in charge of research and development.
   SmithKline officials did not offer an explanation for Crooke's
resignation. It follows by several weeks the resignation of James
Cavanaugh, 51, former head of the company's U.S. pharmaceutical
operaions and comes at a time of financial and managerial turmoil
for the company. Crooke was unavailable for comment.
   ``Clearly, SmithKline is going to be looking at its businesses,
including research, to find ways to initiate savings and maybe cut
programs that don't make sense,'' said Joseph Ricardo, a drug
industry analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. ``A lot of people are
going to be singled out and many more heads will roll.''
   On June 16, SmithKline officials disclosed that the company
expected a sharp decline in profits for the second quarter because
of a decline in sales of its two main prescription drugs _ Tagamet,
which is used to treat ulcers and Dyazide, an anti-hypertension
drug. The two products, which are facing intense competition from
rival drugs, account for about $1.5 billion of SmithKline's $4.3
billion annual sales.
   Then, last month, the company reported that its second-quarter
profit had dropped by 25 percent from levels in the same quarter
last year.
   Company officials also disclosed that they would restructure
SmithKline's three-tiered pharmaceutical business in an effort to
gain better ccontrol over the relatively autnomous units, make
communication easier among the segments and increase the company's
ability to respond to competition.

   Donnay SA rose to top seed among the
world's tennis racket makers when Bjorn Borg wielded its ware, but
as the Swedish champion's career faded, so did the company's
fortunes.
   Those close to the Belgian firm said Thursday that family-owned
Donnay's debts have mushroomed to $35 million, and there is little
hope of reaching an accord with creditors to avoid bankruptcy.
   ``We do not see how we can survive any longer in the current
financial situation,'' Donnay managing director Ile Mioc told the
daily De Standaard.
   Donnay's creditors refuse to provide fresh capital unless the
firm, which has subsidiaries in the United States, Hong Kong,
Brazil and Switzerland, comes up with a acceptable restructuring
plan, said Fabrice Jacquemart, a spokesman for the government of
Wallonia, in southern Belgium.
   The Donnay family still controls 55 percent of the firm, with
Wallonia and the Belgian government owning the remainder.
   ``The most likely solution is a takeover after the bankruptcy,''
Jacquemart said.
   Donnay was founded in 1910 as a family business with six workers
making wooden tool handles. It was decades later, after Donnay
signed a promotion contract with a little-known Swedish rookie,
that the company skyrockted to prominence.
   Borg went on to reap five consecutive Wimbledon titles and
dominated the sport in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and Donnay
followed his fortunes, making over 1.5 million rackets a year and
employing a staff of 600.
   ``Borg was such a piece of luck to them,'' said Jacquemart.
``They were nowhere near what they were once they had him.''
   But Donnay's success began to fade when the Swede retired in
1981.
   Borg left mid-way through a five-year, $5 million contract with
Donnay, depriving the firm of its main advertising outlet. ``It all
went downhill from there,'' said Jacquemart.
   Donnay, which also makes sports wear, never managed to attract
another leading player to promote its products. ``They did not have
the negotiating skills to catch another big contract,'' said
Jacquemart.
   The company's problems were exacerbated by a management that had
difficulty adapting to Donnay's new international market position
as well as keeping pace with the latest tennis technology.
   Tennis players were shifting from wooden rackets to synthetic
materials, and Donnay all but missed out on the revolution.
   ``They did not know what was happening. With their weak
management capabilities they did not fathom the importance of the
technology change,'' said Jacquemart.
   Finally, in 1986, Donnay stopped making the wooden rackets that
had accounted for two-thirds of its sales just five years earlier.
   Donnay's output fell to 800,000 rackets a year, its staff was
cut to 350, and last year the company lost $2.23 million. Donnay's
share of the world racket market now amounts to a mere 10 percent.
   Despite its flagging fortunes, money was a problem. Because of
the once-famous Donnay name, banks continued to provide the company
with millions of dollars worth of credit.
   With debts piling up, it is unlikely a takeover candidate will
surface before Donnay is declared bankrupt.
   ``There will be a lot more candidates when there is a
bankruptcy,'' Jacquemart said.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to forecasts for
an increasing likelihood of rain in the Midwest on Friday.
   Profit-taking ahead of the Agriculture Department's crop
production report added to drop in prices for future deliveries of
corn, wheat and soybeans, analysts said.
   Several private meteorologists said a tropical depression near
the Gulf Coast could bring more rain to the drought-stricken
Midwest, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Soybeans led the decline, with the contract for August delivery
tumbling more than 10 cents a bushel.
   The USDA crop report, scheduled for release at 3 p.m. EDT in
Washington, was expected to indicate further drought damage to the
crops during July.
   Observers were expecting the USDA to predict about a 40 percent
decline in corn production and a 20 percent to 25 percent drop in
soybean production from last year's levels.
   In its report, the USDA estimated the 1988 U.S. corn crop at
4.48 billion bushels, a 37 percent reduction from last year's
harvest of 7.06 billion. The agency estimated soybean production at
1.47 billion bushels, a 23 percent drop from last year's 1.91
billion. And the USDA estimated wheat production at 1.82 billion
bushels, a 14 percent decline from last year's harvest of 2.11
billion.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was 2{
cents to 3} cents lower with September at $2.97\ a bushel; oats
were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with September at $2.74{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 17 cents lower with August at $8.54 a
bushel.

<HEAD>U.S. Judge Gives Drought Lawsuits Class-Action Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has given nationwide
class-action lawsuit status to farmers who allege that the Chubb
Group of Insurance Cos. breached contracts by failing to pay
drought insurance claims.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin granted the class-action status
Wednesday and confirmed Thursday that it applied to affected
farmers nationwide, not just in Ohio.
   Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer representing the farmers,
said he believed the class action would cover an estimated 8,800
farmers in 10 states who could have claims against Chubb. Chesley
estimated it could cost $380 million to pay off all those claims at
once.
   The cases trace to so-called drought insurance offered to
farmers earlier this year. Chubb authorized issuance of up to $30
million in coverage to farmers whose crops suffered major damage
attributed to the drought, but agents sold an estimated $400
million worth of insurance.
   The suits name as defendants New Jersey-based Chubb and its
agent, California-based Good Weather Agriculture. The suits demand
full payments for farmers whose crops were damaged by the drought,
as well as unspecified punitive damages. Lawyers for the farmers
hope the case can go to trial within four months.
   Chubb officials say the company did nothing wrong. The company
recently took out full-page newspaper advertisements in numerous
cities to defend its practices.
   At least 5,000 of 8,717 applicants for drought insurance have
opted to take a double-premium refund from Chubb rather than hold
out for insurance coverage, the company said. Another 1,100 have
decided to take the insurance, valued at a total $40 million of
coverage, Chubb spokeswoman Mary Lu Korkuch said.
   The double-premium offer was made last month after agents sold
farmers more than $400 million of the drought insurance coverage. A
maximum of $30 million had been authorized by the underwriter, but
Chubb maintained that a huge volume of applications in the last
days the insurance was available caused it to be over-subscribed.
   Chubb officials said the double-premium refund will cost the
company about $20 million. Chesley said he will try to invalidate
the double-premium offer, which could have the effect of preventing
farmers from taking part in the class action.
   The nationwide class-action suit will be broken into subclasses
by state to account for the differences in state insurance laws.
   The drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack
of rain between June 1 and Aug. 31, based on a sliding scale.

   Commending ``the indomitable spirit'' of
drought-stricken farmers, President Reagan on Thursday signed
America's largest-ever disaster relief bill.
   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said. ``But it'll
tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you
to return to your accustomed role.''
   The president signed the measure just hours before the
Agriculture Department issued a new crop forecast that said
production of the nation's No. 1 crop, corn, would be down more
than a third from last year. The drought will cause consumer food
prices to go up an average 3 percent to 5 percent from 1987.
   Reagan, standing before several farmers invited to the Rose
Garden signing ceremony, said the $3.9 billion aid package
``expresses a distinctly American tradition ... of lending a
helping hand when misfortune strikes.''
   Reagan praised Democratic and Republican congressional leaders
for putting aside partisan differences to speed act on the bill,
and the heads of the House and Senate agriculture committees
returned the compliment.
   One of the farmers, Herman Krone, who gave Reagan a tour of his
ravaged corn and soybean crops last month near Du Quoin, Ill.,
said: ``I think that Washington has done one of their better jobs
right here.''
   ``It's a good buffer, and it's probably enough to get most
people over the hump this year,'' said Keith Salter, who is
struggling with his drought-baked wheat, barley and oat farm near
Menoken, N.D.
   ``It won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing,'' he
said.
   Reagan said the legislation, which also provides assistance to
dairy cattlemen and ethanol producers, ``represents the largest
disaster relief measure in history.''
   ``Congratulations to America's farmers for the indomitable
spirit with which they have been facing this crisis,'' he said.
   The USDA report estimated this year's corn harvest at 4.48
billion bushels, down 37 percent from 1987, and the soybean harvest
at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year.
   Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,
down 13 percent.
   Earlier, the National Weather Service said that its 10-day
outlook promised little relief from the dry spell, with the
exception of rains spawned by tropical storm Beryl in the Southeast.
   The disaster-relief measure, among other things, provides aid
for farmers suffering crop losses of more than 35 percent of their
expected harvest because of the drought or other calamities. The
payments would be equal to 65 percent of the lost income. Farmers
whose crop losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield would
receive payments equal to 90 percent of lost income.
   The measure also makes feed assistance available for producers
of many varieties of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats,
pigs, poultry, horses used for food or in food production and fish
used for food.
   Money for the payments is expected to come from savings that the
government will realize as a result of the drought, since farm
income-support payments are based in part on how much individual
growers produce. With crops down because of the drought, the amount
the government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. must put out in such
payments is down also.
   Reagan noted that he was at one point concerned that the bill
would be overloaded with costly special-interest provisions, and
quoted Krone as telling him, `Let's save the Christmas trees for
the 25th of December.''
   ``Well, we've done just that,'' Reagan said.
   The Agriculture Department said farmers intending to apply for
relief under the drought bill should organize all their records and
other evidence of their crop losses. The department said, however,
that the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service would
not be ready to start accepting applications for several weeks.
   Once the preliminary rule-making for the program is complete,
farmers will apply to their ASCS county agent for both the disaster
payments and livestock feed assistance. Farmers seeking government
loans also available under the program should contact their local
Farmers Home Administration offices, USDA said.
   As approved by the Senate, the measure would have allowed
ethanol manufacturers to buy as much as 2 million taxpayer-owned
bushels of corn a month each at bargain prices. Ethanol is ethyl
alcohol that is mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol.
   The final version Reagan signed makes the program optional, and
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng is not expected to put it in
effect. The measure also would put the subsidy off limits to huge
corporations.
   ``It's not a perfect solution, but it is a helping hand to those
in need out there,'' said Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. ``As I've stated all
along, hold on, help is coming. It's a compassionate, sensitive
piece of legislation that hopefully will keep most of those that

   ``It's safe to say, without this bill, hundreds of thousands of
farmers and ranchers would have faced bankruptcy this fall,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
   ``From a standpoint of proceeeding in farming, it'll make a
difference, whether the man farms after this year or not,'' Krone
said.
   Asked if he could use some of the water being generously spread
over the White House north lawn by an elaborate sprinkler system,
Krone replied: ``If I had the water, I'd be sprinkling my crops.''

<HEAD>Transport Workers' Contract Vote is Setback for Pan Am</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest union at Pan Am Corp. rejected a new
labor agreement, and analysts said Thursday the move could spark a
new round of conflict between labor and management at the
financially pressed airline.
   Members of the Transport Workers union voted by a ``substantial
margin'' to reject the contract agreed on by the union's leadership
and Pan Am management on July 15, union spokesman Jim Gannon said
Thursday. He said the final vote count was not available yet.
   The union represents about 5,200 mechanics, aircraft service
personnel and flight dispatchers at New York-based Pan Am, the
nation's eighth-largest airline.
   Pan Am declined to comment on the vote, which dealt the airline
a major setback in its efforts to cut labor costs. The vote against
the contract fueled speculation that Pan Am could revive its recent
threat to sell a large portion of its assets.
   The proposed Transport Workers contract had called for a wage
freeze in return for Pan Am withdrawing its threat to sell assets.
The airline, engaged in sporadic talks with the Transport Workers
since February, originally had sought a 10 percent cut in wages.
   ``It's not going to be easy,'' said John Pincavage, an airline
analyst for PaineWebber Inc. ``They (Pan Am) could go back to the
old way of threatening to do different things.''
   Speculation has been rife in recent weeks that the embattled
carrier could target for sale its relatively profitable South
American routes and its maintenance operations in Miami and New
York.
   In a recent interview, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett disclosed
that potential buyers were lined up for the international routes,
the Miami repair facility and parts of Pan Am's maintenance
operations in New York.
   Plaskett also has threatened to ``close down'' the airline if
wage cuts and other labor concessions aren't made by all the unions.
   Management could take a ``softer'' approach and seek concessions
from the Transport Workers on work rules and other non-pay issues
instead of the wage freeze, Pincavage suggested.
   Pan Am, which lost $265.3 million last year, believes it needs
about $540 million over three years in pay cuts and other
concessions to turn itself around. The contract with the Transport
Workers would have saved the airline about $81 million over the
next three years, according to both the union and Pan Am.
   Pan Am also is seeking $90 million in wage reductions from its
flight attendants and has imposed $35 million in cuts on employees
represented by the Teamsters union under federal labor rules. The
unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed to cuts
totaling about $240 million over three years.
   Efforts were underway Thursday to bring together representatives
of the three hold-out unions _ the Transport Workers, flight
attendants and Teamsters _to propose a new round of joint
negotiations to Pan Am, said William Genoese, director of the
Teamsters' airline division.
   Margaret Brennan, president of the flight attendants union at
Pan Am, said it was too early to tell how the Transport Workers
vote would affect her union's situation.
   The defeat of the Transport Workers contract raises the specter
of renewed labor-management strife at the airline like the conflict
that exploded last February with the Teamsters. After their strike
deadline passed, leaders of the 4,500-member Teamsters local vowed
``guerrilla warfare'' against Pan Am, including deliberate
diversion of baggage.
   This time, ``it's not clear how close to the edge both sides are
going to push it,'' said Anthony Hatch, an analyst for Argus
Research Corp.
   He suggested that Pan Am could flex its muscle with the
recalcitrant unions by selling profitable assets such as its World
Services subsidiary, which sells security, maintenance and other
services to government agencies and other airlines.

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today,
struggling to stabilize after the market's recent steep decline.
   Analysts said the market's drop over the past week had pushed
prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for
``bargains.''
   But they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent
rise in interest rates.
   Several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from
9.5 percent to 10 percent, a day after the Federal Reserve
increased the rate it charges on loans to private financial
institutions.
   The timing of the Federal Reserve's increase in its discount
rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent suggested to many Wall Streeters
that the Fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becoming
more aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up.
   For one thing, the rate increase came just as the Treasury was
beginning a quarterly sale of debt securities.

<HEAD>May Department Stores' Profit Up 3.3 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. reported Thursday
that its profit after taxes edged up 3.3 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, as sales increased 21 percent.
   The nation's seventh-largest retailer said its second-quarter
profit rose to $63 million, or 42 cents a share, from $61 million,
or 40 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Second-quarter sales expanded to $2.72 billion from $2.25
billion a year earlier.
   Sales and earnings for the latest quarter include results from
the 38-store Foley's and 18-store Filene's department stores
divisions, which May acquired for $1.5 billion effective May 1. The
second-quarter results also include a pretax gain of $47 million,
or 19 cents a share, from the sale of May Florida, a five-store
department store division based in Jacksonville, Fla.
   In addition, the results for the quarter include a pretax charge
of $26 million, or 11 cents a share, for costs related to closing
non-productive store locations and $22 million, or 9 cents a share,
for integrating Foley's and Filene's into the parent company.
   During the second quarter, May signed a letter of intent to sell
its 76-store Loehmann's specialty store division. The transaction
is expected to be completed by mid-September.
   In the first six months of the year, May earned $125 million, or
83 cents a share, little changed from $125 million, or 81 cents a
share, in the first half of 1987.
   First-half sales rose 12 percent, to $4.95 billion from $4.42
billion a year earlier.
   May operated 3,090 stores at the end of the first half. Store
openings during the second quarter included one Caldor store, two
Venture stores and 50 Payless ShoeSource stores.

<HEAD>Batus Extends Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. on Thursday extended its $4.4
billion tender offer for Farmers Insurance Group Inc. in what was
described as a plan to demonstrate shareholders' support for the
proposed buyout.
   The $63-a-share cash tender offer to Farmers' shareholders, set
to expire Thursday, was extended until midnight Wednesday, the
Louisville, Ky.-based tobacco and retailing company said.
   That is two days before the deadline on a parallel offer to
management that offers $72 a share in cash if a friendly deal can
be forged.
   Farmers, which has said it would consider the higher bid, had no
comment on the extension.
   The $63-a-share offer values the company at $4.4 billion; the
$72-a-share offer for a friendly merger values it at $5 billion.
   It is customary to announce the number of shares stockholders
have tendered, or offered to sell, when an offer is extended. With
the extension of its $63-a-share offer, Batus expects to have
received offers from a significant number of shareholders before
the deadline set on the higher bid to management.
   Announcing strong shareholder support would increase pressure on
Farmers' management to negotiate a friendly buyout, said spokesman
Gene Russell.
   As of Aug. 10, owners of 17 percent of Farmers' stock had
offered to sell their shares, Batus said Thursday.
   That is considerably fewer than the approximately 30 percent
Batus reported had been tendered as of the last extension of the
offer. Russell attributed the difference to institutional traders'
practice of tendering their shares immediately before such
deadlines and then withdrawing them until the next deadline looms.
   Los Angeles-based Farmers and Batus, a subsidiary of BAT
Industries PLC of Great Britain, also are fighting the takeover
battle before insurance regulators in nine states.

<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved decidedly lower in hectic
trading Thursday amid concerns that the currency's new-found
strength would not be tolerated.
   Gold prices finished slightly higher. Republic National Bank of
New York quoted a bid of $429.30 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4
p.m. EDT, up from $428.80 late Wednesday.
   The dollar had been losing ground but radically changed
direction upward when several of the nation's leading banks hiked
their prime lending rate to 10 percent, up half a percentage point
to its highest level in more than three years.
   ``When the prime came out, people rushed to buy dollars and we
had a rally, but that just ended up giving sellers a better level
to sell at,'' said George DeLuna, a vice president at Irving Trust
Co.
   The currency was unable to sustain the gains. Statements by West
German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and continued talk of a
Group of Seven meeting also had a dampening effect on the dollar.
   Stoltenberg's comments to reporters that further increases in
the dollar would be ``problematic'' pushed the currency lower both
in Europe and at home.
   And rumors that the dollar's strength would be the topic of
discussion at a meeting of the Group of Seven major industial
nations _ the United States, Japan, Great Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy, and Canada _ continued to circulate even though no
meeting has been scheduled.
   Traders speculated that at least one central bank had entered
the market during the trading session. While it was unclear whether
the Federal Reserve was on hand selling dollars, DeLuna said,
``whoever did it did a good job of concealing who they were.'' He
said the dollar was sold mainly against the West German mark, but
other currencies also were affected.
   Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank
in Chicago, said all the rumors ``basically got the market pretty
nervous,'' and the dollar fell through several technical resistance
levels.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.85 yen to a closing 134.07 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted lower at 133.65 yen. In New York, the dollar closed
at 132.74 yen, down from 133.68 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7010 to buy one pound, more than $1.6910 late Wednesday. In New
York, it cost $1.7103 to buy one pound, expensive than Wednesday's
$1.6971.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.8833 West German marks, down from 1.9068;
1.5735 Swiss francs, down from 1.5955; 6.3863 French francs, down
from 6.4505; 1,397.50 Italian lire, down from 1,409.50, and 1.2198
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2274.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.8995 West German marks, down from 1.9155;
1.5905 Swiss francs, down from 1.5995; 6.4350 French francs, down
from 6.4780; 2.1425 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1655; 1,406.50
Italian lire, down from 1,414.00, and 1.2231 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2273.
   Gold prices firmed somewhat. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold for current delivery closed at $429.30 a troy ounce, up
slightly from $429.20 on Wednesday.
   Gold in London was unchanged from Wednesday, closing at a late
bid of $428.25 a troy ounce. In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at
a bid $428.65 compared with $427 late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold rose $1.77 to close at a bid $431.79 an ounce.
   Silver for immediate delivery closed at $6.685 a troy ounce on
New York's Comex, up from $6.677 on Wednesday. In London, the metal
was trading at a late bid of $6.70 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $6.67.

<HEAD>Regulators Unaware of Depths of Problems Before FirstRepublic
Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condition of First RepublicBank Corp. of
Dallas was ``clearly worse than anyone of us knew'' when federal
regulators created the bank by merging two troubled Texas banks,
the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. testified
Thursday.
   Thirteen months after the merger of InterFirst Corp. and
RepublicBank Corp., the FDIC took over FirstRepublic in what may be
the largest federal bank rescue ever.
   The FDIC is advancing $4 billion to help NCNB Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C., acquire the bank. The North Carolina company has
agreed to pay $210 million to $240 million to acquire a 20 percent
stake in NCNB Texas National Bank. For five years it will have an
option to buy the remaining 80 percent from the FDIC.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman estimated the goverment may
recoup some of the $4 billion to reduce the agency's cost to $2
billion to $3 billion, which would still be more than the $1.7
billion the FDIC does not expect to recover from its 1984 bailout
of Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago.
   At a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee, Seidman said
regulators knew the two Dallas banks were in trouble but could not
foresee that conditions would change ``rapidly and adversely after
the merger took place.''
   While regulators knew both banks were in trouble, Seidman said,
officials believed the new institution ``had a reasonable chance to
succeed.''
   Although the merger was to result in an infusion of $200 million
in new capital and annual reductions of $100 million in operating
costs, ``it was not enough to overcome these problems,'' he said.
   Without the merger, the two banks ``clearly would have failed,''
he said.
   Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., said
auditing of the two banks before the merger was ``not sufficiently
adequate.''
   The Comptroller of the Currency's office handles those audits,
and spokeswoman Lee Cross said that although a formal examination
was not done before the merger, the agency did a thorough review of
the two banks' loan portfolios.
   In a letter to the Federal Reserve, which had final approval of
the merger, the comptroller's office wrote in April 1987:
   ``Both InterFirst and Republic are seriously troubled
institutions as confirmed by our recent on-site reviews. We believe
that their future viability depends on some form of outside
assistance or other transaction such as the one proposed.
   ``In developing our recommendation, we were mindful of the fact
that certain unresolved accounting questions as well as lingering
difficulties in the Texas economy may affect adversely some of the
underlying financial projections in the proposals, especially
short-term profitability.
   ``Also, we are aware that the proposal is being viewed with some
degree of skepticism by market funding sources whose continued
support will be critical to the survival of the combined
instituion. These matters unquestionably are clear threats to the
ultimate success of the proposal.''
   Ms. Cross said the letter was ``not what you call a ringing
endorsement'' of the merger proposal.
   She said officials believed the real estate market in Texas was
about to turn around at the time of the merger, but its failure to
climb out of recession hit the new bank hard.
   Seidman said the FDIC had recommended the merger.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he understood that the Dallas
branch of the Federal Reserve had recommended against the merger as
``imprudent'' but Seidman said he ``did not know that to be the
case.''
   Seidman said the FDIC may have two more large bank failures on
the horizon, but would not identify the banks, their locations or
when a collapse might occur.
   When asked about the most pressing needs of the banking
industry, Seidman said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
needs prompt attention.
   Seidman said it could cost about $50 billion to restore health
to the savings and loan industry, while the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, regulator of the nation's 3,100 savings and loans, puts the
price tag at $31 billion.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 1, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,027.7 billion from $3,022.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,823.2 billion from $3,820.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $784.4 billion from $781.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,015.1 billion, a 6.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,800.4 billion, up 5.9 percent, while M1
rose 6.2 percent to an average of $776.3 billion.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $77 million in
the week ended Aug. 3, compared with a decline of $102 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings from the
Federal Reserve System averaged $525 million a day in the week
ended Wednesday, down from $656 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $124 million
in the two weeks ended Wednesday, down from a revised $625 million
in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $277.9 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $281.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Major U.S. banks boosted the prime lending rate
back into the double digits Thursday for the first time in three
years, reflecting the Federal Reserve's drive to push all interest
rates higher to stave off inflation.
   The half-percentage point hike in the prime _ to 10 percent _
pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of
1985. It was the third increase in the rate so far this year and
the second in a month.
   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and
adjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch the
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise
in recent months.
   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in its
tracks,'' explained Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
the investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's a
healthy thing right now.
   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That's
preventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing.''
   Economists say the rise in the prime will affect small- to
medium-sized businesses and consumers more so than large
corporations, which borrow more cheaply in the open market by
issuing commercial paper, or short-term unsecured IOUs.
   Home equity lines of credit are usually pegged to the banks'
prime rate, while many home mortgages are tied to interest rates
paid on Treasury bills.
   The financial markets took Thursday's news in stride after
weathering the storm that followed the Fed's increase in a key
lending rate earlier in the week.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
up 5.16 to 2,039.30. Bond prices, which generally decline in the
face of rising interest rates, ended mixed.
   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,
although the prime rate hike was credited by some European traders
for preventing a free fall.
   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the prime hike
Thursday morning, with other major banks across the country quickly
following suit.
   The increase brings the closely watched rate to its highest
level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from
10 percent.
   At the start of the year, the prime stood at 8.5 percent. It was
raised to 9 percent on May 11 and then another half percentage
point on July 14.
   The latest move had been anticipated after the Fed signaled its
desire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 6.5
percent from 6 percent on Tuesday, citing inflationary pressures.
The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to
member banks.
   Economists said banks were justified in raising the prime to the
current double-digit level because their own borrowing costs had
risen. Rates banks pay on products such as certificates of deposits
or money market accounts have been forced up, although not at the
same pace as bank loans.
   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be
overheating and inflation creeping up.
   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist for the investment firm Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the catalyst for raising the prime came
from the rising federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans
between banks. That rate, which has lingered around 7.5 percent for
most of the summer, surged above 8 percent at the start of business
Thursday.
   ``Usually there's a pretty good correlation between the spread
of fed funds and the prime rate,'' she said.

   Assets of the nation's 447 money market mutual
funds rose $840.3 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $265.55 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.64 billion drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 221 general purpose funds rose $791.1 million to $83.7
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased $135.9 million
to $113.21 billion, and assets of 125 institutional funds declined
$86.7 million to $68.64 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.98 percent from 6.95 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.90 percent from 6.83 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
34 days, down from 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.83 percent as of Wednesday from 5.82 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.42
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.38 the
previous week. Yields were 7.72 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.67
percent; 8.04 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.00 percent; and
8.40 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.37 percent.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean prices closed mostly lower Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, but market analysts said new government
estimates of a sharply smaller harvest could send prices higher on
Friday.
   After trading closed for the day, the Agriculture Department
predicted the smallest harvest in 12 years from America's
drought-stressed soybean fields.
   On other markets Thursday, cattle futures moved lower while pork
futures advanced; precious metals were mixed; energy futures
gained; and stock-index futures rose.
   The USDA estimated 1988 soybean production at 1.47 billion
bushels based on crop conditions Aug. 1. That would be the smallest
U.S. soybean crop since the 1976 harvest of 1.29 billion bushels.
   The government's soybean estimate was well below market
expectations and should drive prices higher at the opening Friday
on all the Chicago crop futures markets, said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller Division of LIT America
Inc., a British-owned commodities trading firm.
   The soybean estimate represents a 23 percent decline from last
year's 1.91 billion-bushel harvest. Grain traders and crop analysts
had been expecting about a 20 percent reduction.
   ``Well, you can't say the USDA's holding back on that one,''
Gidel said. ``They impressed everybody.''
   He said corn prices could rise despite the USDA corn production
estimate of 4.48 billion bushels, which was higher than the market
had expected. The number represents a 37 percent drop from last
year's harvest of 7.06 bilion bushels.
   The USDA estimated wheat production at 1.82 billion bushels, 14
percent below the 1987 crop; and oat production at 206 million
bushels, 45 percent lower than the 1987 harvest.
   Trader Victor Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said the
crop report could push grain prices higher on Friday, but said the
increasing prospect of rain in the Midwest on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday could lead to some selling.
   Several private meteorologists added rain to their forecasts on
Thursday, citing moisture moving northward from a tropical
depression near the Gulf Coast. The forecasts sparked a light
sell-off near the close of Thursday's session.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in September at $3.82{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to
3{ cents lower with September at $2.97\ a bushel; oats were 2 cents
to 3 cents higher with September at $2.74{ a bushel; and soybeans
were 6{ cents to 19{ cents lower with August at $8.56 a bushel.
   Pork futures rallied Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
as cash prices rose but cattle futures retreated on profit-taking
despite continued strength in the cash cattle markets.
   ``Fundamentally it's hard to justify a break (in cattle futures
prices) but I guess the market needed one after being so strong
earlier in the week,'' said Philip Stanley, a livestock analysts
with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Stanley said a leap in soybean futures prices could bring a
corresponding jump in pork futures prices because soybean meal is
used as feed for hogs.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .43 cent lower with August at
69.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .50 cent lower
with August at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .72
cent higher with August at 46.62 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .17 cent to .97 cent higher with August at 35.72 cents
a pound.
   Gold and silver prices were nearly unchanged Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   The inflationary implications of a rise in grain prices should
give the precious metals markets a boost, said John O'Connell,
metals analyst in New York with Refco Inc.
   ``The crop report is likely to influence the metals for the next
day or two,'' he said. ``It looked like some pretty horrendous
numbers for the beans.''
   Gold settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with August at
$429.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1.2 cents higher with
September at $6.715 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices finished mostly higher in light trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange after fluctuating in a narrow
range.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 23 cents
higher with September at $15.76 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent
to .41 cent higher with September at 44.56 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .45 cent higher with
September at 46.02 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 1.15 points higher at 263.20.

   Here is a partial list of states producing
corn, soybeans, spring wheat and upland cotton this year.
   According to the Agriculture Department, the states listed
produced 94 percent of the nation's corn last year, 96 percent of
the soybeans and almost 100 percent of the cotton.
   North Dakota produced about 80 percent of the durum wheat last
year. The biggest producers of ``other'' spring wheat included
Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.
   The Aug. 1 average yields per acre, in bushels, for corn,
soybeans and wheat are in the first column; the total production in
thousands of bushels is in the second. For upland cotton, the
yields are in pounds per acre and production in thousands of bales.

<HEAD>US Sprint Billing Explanation Satisfies Feds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
satisfied with US Sprint Communications Co.'s efforts to resolve
billing complaints from its long-distance telephone customers, an
FCC official said Thursday.
   ``From our perspective the matter is closed,'' said Greg Vogt,
chief of the enforcement division of the FCC's common carrier
bureau.
   The FCC had sent US Sprint a letter last month warning the phone
company that it faced sanctions unless it did a better job
responding to billing complaints.
   The agency ordered US Sprint to explain the procedures it has in
place to investigate complaints forwarded by the FCC and outline
what steps the company intended to take to speed resolution of
these complaints.
   In response to the letter, US Sprint earlier this week told the
FCC it is getting fewer complaints about billing problems and that
the problems are being resolved more quickly.
   The FCC's concern focused on the complaints that the agency
receives from US Sprint customers and forwards to the company. At
the time the letter was sent, Vogt said these complaints likely
were far fewer than the number of customer complaints sent directly
to US Sprint.
   But US Sprint says it is well on the way to resolving the
billing problems that plagued the company after it was formed in
July 1986 as a joint venture of GTE Corp.'s Sprint and United
Telecommunications' US Telecom. United Telecommunications will take
a majority ownership of US Sprint later this year.
   US Sprint officials have blamed much of their billing problems
on the merging of the two phone systems.
   ``We think the severe billing problems we had in the past are
pretty much behind us,'' said Leon Kestenbaum, a US Sprint vice
president who met with FCC officials about the matter on Wednesday.
   ``There are always going to be some things that aren't perfect,
but basically we think the problem is well over 90 percent
solved,'' he said.
   Vogt said the agency was ``very pleased'' with US Sprint's
efforts to resolve quickly customer complaints about bills. He
added that the FCC will continue to monitor the company's
performance and ``we'll see in the next few months whether they
live up to their promises.''
   US Sprint is the nation's third-largest long-distance company
after American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications
Corp.

   The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center said
Thursday it has ordered a powerful new computer nearly two years

here,'' Carnegie Mellon President Cyert said. ``One of the most
critical elements is the supercomputer center.''
   As part of a contract, the center will make a $10 million down
payment for the $25 million machine, which is not scheduled for
delivery until the third quarter of 1990.
   Cray officials said this was the first time the company had
committed itself to selling a specific supercomputer so early in
development, and they admitted being concerned because of the great
amount of work remaining to be done.
   ``There's no reason to believe that we will not be successful,''
said Edward A. Masi, Cray's vice president of marketing. ``But you
never know until you ship the product.''
   The machine, to be known as the Cray 3, is expected to be the
world's most powerful supercomputer, capable of speeds at least
three times as fast as today's quickest machine. It also would be
the first commercial computer to be based on gallium arsenide,
rather than on silicon microelectronics.
   Cray hopes to have a prototype ready for testing by the end of
this year.
   Under terms of its contract with Cray, the Supercomputing Center
will first purchase a Cray Y-MP, a machine introduced in February.
The Y-MP, capable of 2.6 billion calculations per second, will be
traded in for the Cray 3 when that machine is ready.
   After accounting for that trade-in and another on a Cray X-MP
that the center already owns, the entire contract will be worth
about $30 million, Cyert said.
   Cray executives acknowledge difficult problems must be
surmounted before the Cray 3 can be built.
   Cyert said the Supercomputing Center's contract contains a
number of escape clauses if Cray cannot meet certain target dates.
   The Cray 3 is the latest creation of Seymour Cray, the computer
designer who founded Cray Research in 1972. If the machine fulfills
its promise, it will represent the fifth time that Cray has set a
new standard for computer speed and power.
   He has said the new computer, under development for six years,
will make as many as 16 billion calculations per second. That is 10
times as fast as his last machine, the Cray 2, and at least three
times as fast as the ETA-10, made by ETA Systems Inc., a Control
Data Corp. subsidiary.
   Cray Research is turning to gallium arsenide for its
semiconductor chips because electricity passes through the compound
more rapidly than through silicon and dissipates less quickly. The
result is a faster chip that uses less power. It also produces less
heat, allowing chips to be more densely packed into the machine.
   Gallium arsenide computer chips have been used in semiconductor
testing equipment and specialized military equipment. But the Cray
3 ``is the farthest anyone has gone'' in the commercial field, said
Gene Miles, president of Aztek Associates, a technology consulting
firm.
   Officials of the Supercomputing Center said they ordered the
Y-MP and the Cray 3 to assure that researchers would have the most
advanced computers.
   The 3-year-old Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is one of five
such centers established around the country with financing from the
National Science Foundation.

<HEAD>Crop Production To Be Down Sharply From 1987; Food Prices Suffer</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: TOPS with 4 new grafs to move higher likely impact; picks up
2nd prv, ``Sharp reductions ... Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

   An annual Agriculture Department survey
confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall
corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food
prices for months and years to come.
   However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent
years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear
actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting
food.
   The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9
billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops
already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to
plant again next spring.
   The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop
will total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year's
harvest and the smallest output since 1983.
   Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a
number of other crops. Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot,
humid weather, is expected to increase from last year.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put
total U.S. crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a
scale used to compare output from year to year. That matched the
low 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage
programs, along with drought, reduced crop production sharply.
   The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested
acre, down from 119.4 bushel per acre last year, a record
year-to-year decline of 34 percent.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production
of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief
economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food
this year, 2 percent next year.
   ``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major
impact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But because
of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases
to assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign
customers and meet our food-aid commitments.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said in a statement, ``Today's crop report confirms our
fears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought.
Fortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it
through this marketing year.''
   The USDA's grim news came hours after President Reagan on
Thursday signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at
helping drought-stricken farmers recover.
   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said to the nation's
farmers. ``But it will tide you over until normal weather and your
own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.''
   The new USDA crop estimates were based on field surveys as of
Aug. 1. In May and June, before drought had made its biggest
impact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an
assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels.
   But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2
billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder
of the season.
   The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down
23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year. Prospects
last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July
projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
   Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,
down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987. In May and June,
the USDA forecast this year's output would be up slightly. The July
projection was 1.84 billion bushels
   The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which
barely stayed ahead of the drought. Later plantings of durum and
other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,
down 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring
varieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains,
showed sharp declines.
   Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent
from last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212
million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1
percent from last year. The crop was projected at 13.7 billion
bales in July.
   Department officials said U.S. grain production this year is
expected to total 192 million metric tons, 31 percent smaller than
the 1987 output. The total grain supply for 1988-89 _ which
includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is
down 24 percent from last season.
   In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson
said production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered,
including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288
million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million
bushels, down 24 percent.
   Wilson said USDA experts ``continue to believe that the drought
will add only one percentage point'' to consumer food prices this
year.
   The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3
percent to 5 percent. Before the heat and dry weather, USDA had
expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer
price index for food next year.
   ``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food
prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said. ``So
this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.''
   He also said the United States is ``looking at an export
situation that is not as good as it was a year ago.'' He said
production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food
supply caused by the drought.
   ``Our figures here today would indicate that food production in
other countries has not been cut that much,'' he said. There
remained a possibility that the United States would import some
soybeans this year, Wilson said.
   He scoffed at any suggestion, however, that the United States
may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses. He
noted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production
this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   Meanwhile, USDA weatherman Norton Strommen said rain in the
midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought.
   ``The drought, as you can see, is still basically with us
throughout the entire United States,'' Strommen said.

<HEAD>Posts Narrowed Loss in 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the publishing,
insurance and theme park concern, said Thursday its second-quarter
loss narrowed as its sales rose 23.5 percent from a year ago.
   The company, which is based in Orlando, Fla., lost $44.6 million
in the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $70.8
million in the same period a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose to $447 million from $362 million a
year earlier.
   The company said it had income of $22.2 million from publishing
operations in the quarter, compared with a loss of $4.1 million a
year earlier.
   It reported income of $12.1 million from theme park operations,
down from $14.3 million a year earlier. Its income from insurance
operations fell to $9.4 million from $10.1 million a year earlier.
   The company underwent a costly restructuring last year as it
avoided a $2 billion takeover bid by British publisher Robert
Maxwell.
   Its interest expense for the latest quarter rose nearly
fivefold, to $78.7 million from $16.7 million a year earlier.
   Before recapitalization charges, the company said its operating
income rose to $38.3 million for the quarter from $13.7 million a
year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, Harcourt lost $80.1
million, virtually the same as its loss for the first six months of
1987.
   Revenue for the first six months rose to $753 million from $647
million a year earlier.

<HEAD>House Bill Would Ban All U.S. Investment, Most Trade With South
Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Thursday to end all U.S.
investment in white-dominated South Africa and impose a near-total
trade embargo in what opponents called an election-year politcal
ploy.
   Supporters hailed the sweeping disinvestment-trade embargo
measure, approved 244-132, as a last-chance opportunity to bring
strong economic pressure to bear to help end South Africa's
apartheid system of racial separation.
   Republican opponents said the bill represents needlessly
destructive ``economic warfare'' and a ``scorched earth'' policy
intended to score political points for Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis and Democratic political activist Jesse
Jackson on the eve of the GOP national convention.
   In the rapidly dwindling time remaining in the 100th Congress,
it is uncertain at best that the bill will be passed by the Senate
or be cleared by Congress over President's Reagan's likely veto.
   In a policy statement, the administration said Reagan's senior
advisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if it
emerges from Congress in its present form because it ``undermines
the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.''
   Before the final vote, the House rejected three
Republican-sponsored amendments, all aimed at diluting or reversing
the impact of the sanctions.
   It defeated, 236-154, an amendment by Rep. William Broomfield,
R-Mich., to permit the president to waive all sanctions if West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan do not impose sanctions
of equal strength. It also would have authorized the president to
extend U.S. aid to help develop black private enterprise in South
Africa.
   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., was dealt a 214-169 defeat on his
amendment to permit the president to waive the section of the bill
barring military and intelligence cooperation with South Africa if
he certifies that is in ``the best interest of the United States.''
   The House also defeated, 259-145, an amendment by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., to strike all new sanctions while retaining the
more limited sanctions imposed in 1986. The amendment would have
urged U.S. companies operating in South Africa to contribute 15
percent of their payroll to black development projects.
   Broomfield insisted the sanctions bill was politically motivated.
   ``Some of us wonder if the real purpose is to be responsive to
the Jackson-Dukakis foreign policy,'' Broomfield said.
   ``We are not bringing this bill to embarrass Republicans,'' said
Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., principal sponsor of the measure.
``We are here to free black South Africa. This has nothing to do
with presidential politics.''
   In an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from his
colleagues, Dellums told the House: ``I listened to those who said
this is going to hurt blacks, it's going to hurt corporations. But
human beings will struggle for their freedom, in peace if they can,
in violence if they must. ... That pales every single argument you
have made. We must end the madness of apartheid.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
additional sanctions against South Africa are much more likely to
retard the end of apartheid than to accelerate its end.
   ``We particularly regret the timing of this House action, which
comes at a delicate moment in the important, serious U.S. mediation
efforts between South Africa, Angola and Cuba,'' she said.
   ``The House debate is more likely to complicate than to promote
their successful conclusion.''
   The U.S. effort is aimed at encouraging the withdrawal of Cuban
and South African forces from Angola and independence and black
majority rule for Namibia.
   The disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economic
sanctions voted by Congress in 1986. They banned all new public and
private loans and investments in South Africa and barred certain
imports and exports.
   The bill contains these major provisions:
   _All U.S. investment in South Africa would be banned and U.S.
corporations with such investments would be compelled to divest
them. The investment ban would not apply to any business in which
blacks or other non-whites have at least a 90 percent ownership
interest.
   _All South African imports to the United States would be banned
except for certain strategic minerals and publications. The 1986
sanctions law banned only agricultural products, coal, textiles,
uranium, and military vehicles.
   _All U.S. exports to South Africa would be prohibited with the
exception of agricultural products, publications and U.S. public
and private assistance.
   _The bill bars an American company or vessel from transporting
crude or refined oil to South Africa. Americans also would be
forbidden to engage in the production of nuclear material in South
Africa.

<HEAD>SAS Buys 40 Percent of Aerolineas Argentinas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airline System has
agreed to buy 40 percent of the national carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas for $204 million, the government announced Thursday.
   The agreement was signed by the director of public enterprises,
Horacio Losoviz, and SAS vice president for strategic planning,
Terje Sunde Johnsen, according to the government news agency Telam.
   The agreement now goes to President Raul Alfonsin, and then
Congress, for ratification.
   The sale is part of Alfonsin's privatization plans, whereby
state enterprises _ particularly unprofitable ones _ are being sold
to private investors. The intention is to reduce the drain on the
cash-strapped public treasury, and improve services.
   The government will retain 51 percent of Aerolineas Argentinas.
The remaining 9 percent will be sold to employees.
