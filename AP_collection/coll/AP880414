<HEAD>Administration Bars NIH From Experiments On Aborted Fetal Tissue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health may not
conduct experiments using tissue from aborted fetuses _ considered
promising in early work on Parkinson's disease _ under a ruling by
the Reagan administration, according to a published report.
   ``This is a very difficult process,'' Dr. Robert E. Windom,
assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human
Services, said Thursday about his decision last week.
   The Washington Post reported the decision in Friday's editions.
   ``The morality and science are all mixed together,'' Windom
said. ``They need to be evaluated before we rush ahead. We just
can't afford to move too hastily on this.''
   Windom's decision was prompted by an NIH proposal to implant
fetal tissue into patients with Parkinson's, the newspaper reported.
   Windom, in a letter to NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden, said he
was ``withholding my approval of the proposed experiments'' due to
``ethical and legal'' questions that had not been addressed
satisfactorily. He directed Wyngaarden to create an outside
advisory committee to examine such questions, the Post said.
   Windom wrote that he does not oppose the use of fetal tissue
from miscarriages or stillbirths, but researchers contacted by the
Post said proper planning is necessary to retrieve the tissue while
it is useful and that it is rarely possible to use fetuses that
have been aborted spontaneously.
   Researchers contacted by the newspaper expressed dismay over the
decision, with Dr. Bernard Liebel, professor of medicine at the
University of Toronto, saying: ``NIH sets the pace, and this will
cripple fetal research in the United States.... It is an
extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense potential.
Depriving research scientists of this material is a great
disservice to humanity.''
   But abortion opponents praised the decision.
   ``If the parents were a part to the killing, they have no right
to assign organs to another person,'' said Dr. John C. Willke,
president of the National Right-to-life Committee. ``that is
desecration of a corpse.''

   A car bomb blew up in front of a club for
U.S. military personnel in Naples on Thursday, killing a U.S. Navy
enlisted woman and four Italians and wounding at least 17,
officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast
that happened shortly after 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) at the USO club.
   A Pentagon spokeswoman said the American woman was stationed at
Naval Communications Area Master Station in Naples. Lt. Janet
Mescus, the spokeswoman, said the woman's identity was being
withheld pending notification of next of kin.
   Italian media quoted officials as saying four Italians were also
killed. One of the bodies at the club's entrance was draped in a
U.S. flag.
   Lt. David Morris, a Navy spokesman in Naples, said an
undetermined number of crewmen from the frigates USS Capodanno and
USS Paul were injured but that no sailor from either ship was
killed.
   Morris said three sailors from the Capodanno and one from the
Paul were admitted to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Naples. He said
one crewman from the Capodanno was treated and returned to his ship.
   Italian media said the bomb exploded during a reception at the
club for the commander of the USS Paul, a torpedo boat destroyer
docked in Naples. Morris and a U.S. Consulate official could not
confirm the report.
   Passers-by screamed and ran when the explosion occurred outside
the club, which is in one of Naples' busiest areas.
   ``I was in the store and we were getting ready to lower the
shutters when the world exploded around us,'' said Valeria
Spinetti, 22, an employee in a nearby shop.
   A spokesmen for Pellegrini Hospital said 14 of the wounded,
including four Americans and eight Italians, were sent to the
hospital. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the
Americans were moved to a U.S. military hospital.
   RAI, the state-run television network, said a 27-year-old
Italian woman was in grave condition.
   Morris said the Capodanno, based in Newport, R.I., and the Paul,
based in Mayport, Fla., were on routine deployment with 6th Fleet.
   Antonio Barrel, the inspector general of public security in
Naples, told the Italian news agency ANSA that authorities do not
yet know if the car bomb was set by foreigners or Italians.
   But ANSA quoted an unidentified police official as saying ``the
Middle East connection seems most likely.''
   Italian news media noted the blast occurred almost exactly two
years after U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in
retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a
night club in West Berlin that killed an American soldier.
   Investigators said the Thursday blast destroyed the inside of
the club and wrecked cars on the street. The bomb apparently was
hidden in a Ford Fiesta that was destroyed by the blast.
   Mescus identified three of the injured Navy servicemen as Chief
Petty Officer Francisco A. Navalta, 39, of the USS Paul, and Petty
Officer 3rd Class Craig Lee Trent, 22, and Senior Chief Petty
Officer Charles Fifer Roberts, 38, both assiged to the USS
Capodanno.
   Morris identified a fourth injured sailor as Stanley Lawson, 27,
an electronics technician on the Capodanno. He was in stable
condition.
   Navalta, from Castillejos, Zambales, Philippines, and Trent,
from Gaither, Md., were also in stable condition.
   Roberts, from East St. Louis, Ill, was treated and released.
   ``Our sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those who
were killed or injured in this brutal act,'' said World USO
President Chuck Hagel from Washington.
   The bombing was the fourth attack in seven years aginst American
installations or personnel in Italy.
   In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers
kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier from his home in Verona. He
was freed 42 days later by a special police unit in Padua.
   In February 1984, terrorists in Rome fatally shot Leamon Hunt, a
U.S. diplomat and director-general of the Multinational Force and
Observers in the Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility.
   In June 1987, a car bomb exploded near the U.S. Embassy in Rome
and at least two rockets were fired at the embassy. There were no
injuries.
   The Navy has a major presence in Naples, headquarters for NATO's
southern command and the support center for the 6th Fleet. An
average of 45 ships, 200 aircraft and over 23,000 people comprise
the fleet, which is deployed in the Mediterranean.

   Earl Clanton Jr. went quietly to his death
in the electric chair Thursday night for strangling a neighbor
during a 1980 robbery.
   Clanton, 33, was pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m., six minutes
after the first of two, one-minute jolts of 2,500 volts each was
administered, said state Department of Corrections spokesman Wayne
Farrar.
   Clanton, who had escaped from death row in 1984, had no final
statement and showed little emotion as he went to his death. The
prison chaplain, Russ Ford, turned his back on the electric chair
as the sentence was carried out.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
earlier in the day had set the stage for the seventh execution in
Virginia since 1982 when it unanimously overturned a stay granted
Tuesday by a federal judge.
   Later Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-2 vote, denied a
stay, and Gov. Gerald L. Baliles refused clemency an hour before
Clanton went to his death.
   Clanton was convicted by a Petersburg jury in 1981 of murdering
38-year-old Wilhemina Smith, a school librarian who lived in his
apartment building. He was on parole at the time for a 1972 murder
conviction in New Jersey.
   The execution was the 98th in the nation since the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the death penalty.
   Besides his mother, a sister, two aunts and lawyers, Clanton's
last visitors included Jay North, the 1960s child TV star of
``Dennis the Menace.'' North has been working on a movie about the
1984 escape of Clanton and five other Virginia death row prisoners.
   ``We became extremely close friends,'' said North. ``We've been
in contant communication, wrote and called. We became like
brothers.''
   About 50 death penalty opponents conducted a vigil and prayer
service outside the prison. A single supporter of capital
punishment shouted, ``Pray for the woman that died.''
   The appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court had centered on abuse
Clanton contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until
after being sentenced to death.
   The appeal cited a psychiatric report saying Clanton suppressed
memories of his violent childhood, thus hampering defense efforts
to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life
sentence.
   However, the federal appeals court said that Clanton's case had
been given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that
his sentencing had been found constitutional.
   In addition, the court said, Clanton's attorney had failed
during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse.
   Clanton was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the
Mecklenburg Correctional Center in 1984. He was recaptured a day
later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at
a coin laundry in Warrenton, N.C.
   At his 1981 trial, Clanton refused his lawyer's request to
submit to a psychiatric examination, and the only mitigating
evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that
he attended Bible classes while in jail awaiting trial.
   After the trial, Clanton said he was beaten as a child by his
father and was sexually abused by his stepmother. After leaving his
father, he moved to New Jersey to live with his mother and was
convicted of a murder. He was later paroled.

<TEXT>
   A rally of nearly 1,000 students at the
University of Massachusetts to protest a ban on alcohol at outdoor
events was the largest demonstration in recent memory, a school
spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, Jeanne Hopkins, said the demonstrators
Wednesday outnumbered recent protests against the CIA, apartheid
and in support of minority students who occupied a campus building
for six days.
   The alcohol ban was ordered last week by Chancellor Joseph
Duffey. Several students at Wednesday's hourlong rally carried beer
cans and chanted ``Joe's gotta go!''
   Half the crowd, some singing ``Give beer a chance,'' marched on
the administration building, but protest leaders said Duffey
refused to meet with them. Administrators, however, said he was
having lunch elsewhere.
   Ms. Hopkins said the demonstration was orderly but probably
would not change Duffey's mind about the ban.

   Kellogg Co. has refused to change or
cancel one of its TV commercials for Nut & Honey Crunch cereal,
despite claims by an activist group that the ad promotes violence
against homosexuals.
   In the commercials, cereal eaters play off the Nut & Honey name
by answering the question of what they are eating with the reply,
``Nothing, honey.''
   The Chicago-based Coalition Against Media-Marketing Prejudice
called ``offensive'' one version that shows a western chuck wagon
cook being threatened by gun-toting cowboys who believe he has
called them ``honey.''
   The commercials ``send a serious and dangerous message _ that
gays and lesbians or anyone perceived as sexually or behaviorally
different are easy and acceptable targets for trivialization,'' the
group said Wednesday outside Kellogg headquarters.
   Kellogg, however, said it would be overreacting to change the
commercial or pull it off the air.The company refused to accept
evidence from experts on psychology, advertising and violence who
backed the group's claim, said spokesman Arthur Johnston.

   The one ton bronze statue of Rice University
founder William Marsh Rice has been festooned with such things as
hats, coats and military regalia since it was placed on campus 58
years ago.
   But on Tuesday, it was facing south instead of north.
   Just before dawn, a campus police officer spotted about 20
people around the statue and noticed a spotlight that usually
illuminates it was dark. As he approached, the group scattered,
said Campus Police Chief Mary Voswinkel.
   Ms. Voswinkel said the officer was able to stop one student, who
was driving a pickup truck away from the quadrangle. The officer
took the student's name and let him go, then sped back to the
statue to investigate.
   The statue appeared intact _ but was facing the Fondren Library
to the south instead of the Lovett Building to the north.
   It took 3{ hours for a crew of professional movers using a crane
to fix the statue.
   ``It was a student prank,'' said Bill Noblitt, Rice's director
of university relations. ``It was a rite-of-spring type thing.''
   Noblitt said the vandalism could have had serious consequences
because students apparently used an A-frame built from 4-by-6 beams
to lift the statue. The devices that were found had cracked, and
the statue could have fallen.
   The pranksters apparently climbed to the roof of the
Architecture Building to disconnect the spotlight and had painted
the A-frame black to help conceal it.
   The student who was questioned will face disciplinary action
from the university, but officials did not release further details.

   Jaime Escalante focuses on the
blackboard with absorbed frustration. Reporters and photographers
have invaded his classroom, and he's concerned his students are
losing their concentration.
   Although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the
subject of the critically acclaimed film ``Stand and Deliver,''
Escalante has more important things on his mind _ like mathematics
and helping his James Garfield High School students to learn as
much as they can.
   ``We have so many people working at Jack in the Box (fast-food
restaurants) and pumping gas,'' he said. Like the movie teacher
portrayed by actor Edward James Olmos, Escalante wants more for his
students, and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their
ticket out of menial jobs.
   ``It's like a sport,'' he said. ``You have to practice every day
to be in shape.''
   His scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical
athletes. Photos show beaming students holding banners heralding
their achievements.
   Each year the number of Escalante students passing the Advanced
Placement calculus test, given by the Educational Testing Service
for college credit, has grown tremendously.
   In 1979, five students took the test and all had a passing mark
of 3 or better. By last year, 87 Garfield students passed the test,
higher than any other school in Southern California.
   The movie concerns an incident in 1982, when 18 students took
the exam and all passed. Surprised that the predominantly Hispanic
class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its
academic accreditation, the ETS accused the students of cheating.
   Twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of
5 or near perfect scores of 4.
   Last year, scores made by Garfield students taking the Advanced
Placement calculus test placed Garfield second in the nation out of
the 4,197 schools with students taking the tough exam, said Janice
Gams with the Educational Testing Service.
   Just 2 percent of American students even attempt the test.
   This year, a record 160 Garfield students are expected to take
the test, and Escalante has set his sights on attracting even more
students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to
continue teaching.
   ``He's your friend, he's your mentor and he's your father,''
said former student Josie Richkarday, who was one of the 18
students suspected of cheating.
   ``He just didn't teach,'' said Richkarday, 23, who is studying
to be a math teacher herself. ``He brought something out of me. If
you're willing to go 50 yards, he'll go 100.''
   Escalante has seen ``Stand and Deliver'' four times and likes
it, although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype
because the Warner Bros. release depicts more gang activity than
really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more
destitute than they really are.
   His students have become doctors and engineers. They work at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which does work for NASA, and for TRW
Inc., and Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Armando Islas, a 1976 Garfield graduate and an oral surgeon with
two offices in the Los Angeles area, credits Escalante with
challenging him to be more than a C student with athletic talent.
   ``He was a fantastic instructor,'' Islas said. ``He kept you
motivated, and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but I
think in that particular environment that's what you needed.''
   In the 14 years Escalante has been at Garfield, he has watched
the gang influence dissipate, due mostly to a tough line by school
administrators and teachers. The graffiti is more or less gone.
And, thanks in part to the reputation of Escalante's math
achievers, the school is respected within the mostly Hispanic
barrio, where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride.
   The days when students didn't want to go to Garfield are over,
said Principal Maria Tostado, who grew up in the area.
   ``There's no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what
you do you're not going to get ahead,'' she said. Today, the school
is well-known for academic prowess.
   Escalante, a 57-year-old father of two sons, was a respected
teacher in Bolivia for 11 years before coming to the United States
at his wife's urging in 1964. Once here, he tried a career in
computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching.
   ``I got real tired,'' he said in an interview. ``I didn't want
to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics.''
   Now he spends his days in a stage-like arena before as many as
52 students who sit on tiered rows, and demands that late comers
get ``The Chair,'' a tot's seat meant to embarrass tardy students
into promptness.
   His classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate. A
foot-high banner curls around the room's corners, greeting students
with: ``Calculus need not be made easy; it is easy already.''
   Another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if
they master math: ``Feel ready to attend any college or university.
Feel prepared to go into real estate, business, engineering. Feel
really good about myself.''
   The students do feel good about themselves. Boredom is replaced
with laughter, smiles and friendly jests, as Escalante tries to
reach them through cheers, swats them with a battered and faded
pillow, practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically
anything to promote learning.
   He was given the nickname ``Kimo Sabe'' by four gang toughs in
his class. The name translates loosely from Spanish as ``the one
who knows.'' He's accepted the nickname, but shakes off such
glorious titles as ``American hero,'' which Newsweek dubbed him in
a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it.
   ``What I tried to do is improve things in my school,'' he said.
   ``He's a master,'' said Tostado, describing Escalante's
teaching. ``He's a genius at it.''
   News crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now,
but while the media intrusion disturbs him, Escalante believes the
rewards from the movie's exposure will offset the Hollywood glare.
   ``It's going to motivate parents to control, to help ... because
the schools alone cannot educate,'' he said. ``It's going to
motivate the students. The teachers are going to see it's better to
teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk.''

   The working class neighborhood
that taught Edward James Olmos respect for humanity and watched the
``Miami Vice'' star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his
latest movie.
   Olmos returned to an East Los Angeles high school last spring to
make ``Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about a magnetic, demanding
math teacher who led an unruly Hispanic class to academic triumph
in 1982.
   The 41-year-old actor was no stranger to the halls of Garfield
High School. His cousin teaches computer science there. Only 1{
miles from his childhood home, it is ethnically mixed, like the
neighborhood he remembers.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' was a smash when it opened in Los Angeles.
It brought in $411,000 during its first week last month, averaging
$14,000 at each of 30 theaters, he said.
   Olmos, an actor of Mexican-American heritage who won an Emmy
Award for his role as Lt. Castillo on the NBC-TV series ``Miami
Vice,'' was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home
area.
   ``This film is probably the most inspirational film I've done to
date,'' he said of the Warner Bros. release.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is about overcoming racial stigmas. It
advances the humanities, something Olmos said he holds close to his
heart; something he learned in a family of eight living in a
neighborhood crowded with Russian, Mexican, Jewish and American
Indian families.
   Olmos, who co-produced and helped write the movie, claims he is
not making a political point.
   ``I'm not a political animal,'' he said. It's the advancement of
the humanities through acting that inspires Olmos.
   ``It's always been that way. It serves me well and makes me
stronger,'' he said.
   ``That doesn't mean I have to make message movies. I think that
art forms, especially films, should be used to entertain. Now if by
chance your entertaining and allowing (your audience) to experience
an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness
to it, well even better.
   ``The criterion, No. 1, is the story. If that story happens to
be socially relevant, well that's wonderful, but if it isn't,
that's OK too.''
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is about an event that drew national
attention to Garfield High School's 1982 calculus class. The
predominantly Hispanic class took and passed an Advance Placement
calculus test, in stark contrast to the rest of the school, which
faced loss of accreditation.
   The 18 students, who were badgered and inspired by computer
specialist-turned-teacher Jaime Escalante, were stripped of their
honors when the Educational Testing Service, which tests U.S.
students and provides their scores to colleges and universities,
accused the entire class of cheating.
   In the movie, Olmos, in his role as Escalante, accuses the
Educational Testing Service of racism. Students from wealthy
Beverly Hills would not be questioned if they passed an Advance
Placement calculus test, but students with Hispanic names from a
barrio high school were suspect, he says in the movie.
   Eventually, the students are vindicated with a second test.
   The movie is not meant to be manipulative, Olmos said. It
presents an event ``that allows you to experience with your own
values.''
   ``We don't give results,'' he said. ``We only give the facts.''

<HEAD>Whisky-Maker Says San Francisco Water Not Good Enough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought-threatened San Francisco Bay
region is getting a little help from an unlikely quarter _ the
makers of Famous Grouse Scotch whisky.
   The manufacturers of the liquor, Matthew Gloag & Sons of Perth,
Scotland, kicked off their latest U.S. sales campaign, but decided
they couldn't bear the thought that San Franciscans might mix their
prized whisky with local tap water.
   ``The fact is that San Francisco tap water does not taste very
good,'' said local Famous Grouse spokesman Ed Schwartz.
   So this month, it started selling a $14 package containing the
scotch and a bottle of water from Great Britain's Strathmore
Valley, a combination the company says is necessary to bring out
the best features of the liquor.
   ``Serious scotch drinkers in San Francisco have been loath to
mix Famous Grouse with the infamous chlorinated city water,'' read
several hundred invitations to a scotch and bagpipe bash Wednesday
at a chic watering hole.
   Famous Grouse, stung by the mere 1.5 gallon-per-capita
consumption of distilled spirits in this country, is trying to
heighten the figure with a U.S. campaign initially targeting San
Francisco and Washington, D.C.
   In the Bay region, a fringe benefit will be to ease ever so
slightly the water shortage threatened by an exceptionally dry
winter.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of some some of
the main events in the war in Afghanistan:
   April 1978 _ The Marxist People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan overthrows the Afghan republic headed by Mohammad Daoud
and installs Nur Mohammad Taraki as president. Daoud, his family
and hundreds of his supporters are killed. The armed, non-communist
resistance begins.
   Feb. 14, 1979 _ U.S. ambassador Adolph Dubs is kidnapped and
killed in Kabul. Afghanistan blames ``enemies of the government''
trying to ``destroy friendship between Afghanistan and the United
States.''
   March 12, 1979, the National Liberation Front, a Moslem group,
calls for a Jihad, or Holy War, against the Kabul government.
   July 1979 _ The Soviets deploy their first combat unit in
Afghanistan, a 400-man airborne battalion sent to Bagram, just
north of Kabul.
   September 1979 _ Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin gains control of
the government after a shootout at the presidential palace.
Official media announce Taraki's resignation and Amin's appointment
as president.
   October 1979 _ Official Kabul media announce Taraki's death.
   December 1979 _ During the last week of the month, a massive
Soviet airlift occurs with 300 transports and 5,000 troops. Soviet
commandos attack the presidential palace. Amin is killed and Babrak
Karmal becomes president.
   January 1980 _ Soviets deploy 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
The United Nations General Assembly votes 104-18 for a resolution
demanding an ``immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of
foreign troops'' from that country.
   February 1980 _ Soviet troop strength increases to 75,000, and
eventually to 115,000, by Western estimates.
   April 1982 _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the
number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan has passed 2.5 million.
   June 182 _ In Geneva, U.N. Undersecretary for Political Affairs
Diego Cordovez conducts the first indirect peace talks between
officials of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kabul represents the Soviets
and Islamabad speaks for the Afghan resistance.
   January 1984 _ Guerrillas gain temporary control of Kandahar,
the second-largest city in Afghanistan.
   April 1984 _ Soviets, for the first time, conduct saturation
bombing of guerrilla strongholds and villages, using TU-16 Badger
heavy bombers.
   August 1984 _ Pakistan lodges a series of protests with the
Kabul government over repeated aerial bombing and cross-border
shelling in which 51 Afghans and Pakistanis were killed and 33
injured.
   May 1985 _ The International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London estimates the Soviets have suffered 20,000 to 25,000
casualties in the 5-year-old war. In Peshawar, Pakistan, an
alliance of fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas joins a grouping of
moderates to form the seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan group.
   June 1985 _ Mutinous Afghan air force officers blow up 20 Afghan
air force planes at an air base in western Farah province.
   May 1986 _ Karmal steps down, reportedly for health reasons.
Western observers claim it is due to Moscow's dissatisfaction at
his failure to defeat the armed resistance. He is succeeded by
Najib, a physician and former chief of state security.
   July 1986 _ Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announces plans
to withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan. Washington later says
the forces mainly were unnecessary anti-aircraft units, and were
replaced by armored regiments.
   September 1986 _ Guerrillas reportedly receive their first U.S.
Stinger and British Blowpipe anti-aircraft missiles. Within months,
they reportedly shoot down an average of one enemy aircraft a day.
   January 1987 _ Najib declares a unilateral cease-fire as part of
a new program of national reconciliation. It is ignored by both
sides, and the guerrillas reject any power-sharing with the
Communists.
   October 1987 _ A survey conducted by Geneva University Professor
Marek Sliwinski for Gallup Pakistan estimates that more than 1.2
million Afghans have died in the war. The U.N. High Commissioner
for refugees estimates that 2.9 million Afghans have fled to
Pakistan and 2.3 million to Iran.
   December 1987 _ One of Gorbachev's chief advisers tells
reporters he expects the Soviet Union to pull out of Afghanistan in
1988.
   January 1988 _ Pakistan President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq declares
his acceptance for some Communist involvement in a future Afghan
government as the price for a Soviet withdrawal. Cordovez begins a
20-day diplomatic shuttle mission between Islamabad and Kabul.
   February 1988 _ Gorbachev offers to withdraw Soviet troops
beginning May 15 and ending 10 months later, if a Geneva accord is
signed by March 15. Cordovez meets for the first time with Afghan
guerrilla leaders. He concludes his shuttle mission in Islamabad,
announcing near-agreement on terms of a Soviet pullout and a new
round of Geneva talks starting March 2.
   March 1988 _ Indirect talks between Islamabad and Kabul resume
with U.S. and Soviet delegations standing by. Agreement is reached
that Soviet troop withdrawal must be completed within nine months
once it starts. But negotations continue past Gorbachev's March 15
target date.
   April 1988 _ Agreement is reached and April 14 date set for
signing in Geneva the accord on Soviet troop withdrawal, return of
refugees and other issues.

   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan told
a cheering audience at the University of Pennsylvania ``you should
thank God Jesse Jackson has emerged'' as a leading presidential
candidate.
   The black Muslim minister, whose appearance set off a week of
controversy and a protest rally by up to 1,000 people, brought most
of the 2,000 in the auditorium to their feet when he said,
``Jackson is running to save a people; he is running to save the
nation.
   ``America is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black skins,
but it hasn't grown up yet,'' Farrakhan said.
   Jackson, during his 1984 presidential campaign, accepted
Farrakhan's support, leading to harsh criticism, particularly from
Jews. Farrakhan has been reported to have praised Hitler and called
Judaism a gutter religion, but he denied Wednesday ever making the
statements.
   During this campaign, Jackson has had no contact with Farrakhan.
   The Muslim minister, whose visit was guarded by strict security
measures that cost the university $6,000, insisted that those
opposing Jackson, especially in the Democratic primary next week in
New York, are using ``me to galvanize Jews against Jesse Jackson.''
   ``They are using me to try to derail him,'' he added.
   The comments came in two-hour speech in which he predicted,
without being specific, that ``a very dark and tragic day is coming
to America, to Israel and to humanity.''
   Over and over Farrakhan told how whites dominate the western
world.
   Referring to the days, more than 125 years ago, when blacks were
slaves in the United States, Farrakhan said he was joining ``my
dear Jewish friends in saying `never again,''' referring to the
phrase Jews use in condemning the Nazi Holocaust.
   ``I am considered a hater, but I am a reminder to the black
people of what has happened to us,'' he said. ``For if we forget it
will happen again.''
   Before his evening speech, the black Muslim minister said the
community would benefit by the controvery his visit has generated.
   ``Even though the atmosphere is charged, I did not charge it,''
he said at a news conference. ``My presence hopefully will help the
students to judge me better.''
   Students gathered for an hour-long demonstration before the
speech, waving signs saying: ``Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No.'' and
``Free Speech, Yes. Hatred, No.''
   ``No matter what Farrahkan says, it doesn't erase what he said
in the past,'' said Daniel Genulka, the rally organizer and
chairman of the Council of Jewish Students. ``We must work together
as a community instead of being at odds.''
   Last week, university officials refused a Jewish group's request
to cancel the visit, saying they respected Farrakhan's right to
free speech. A letter condemning Farrakhan and signed by more than
700 students and teachers appeared in the Wednesday student paper.
   The visit comes in the wake of the 18-month suspension of a
predominantly Jewish fraternity for hiring two black women to
perform as strippers at a party. Party-goers reportedly shouted
racial epithets.
   University President Sheldon Hackney defended the Farrakhan
visit.
   ``In an academic community, open expression is the most
fundemental value. We can't have free speech just some of the time
for some of the people,'' he told the rally.
   Security officers estimated the number of protesters at 1,000,
but university spokesman Bruce White said no more than 400 attended
the rally and the others were waiting to clear the tight security
into the auditorium where Farrakhan was speeking.
   The sell-out crowd of 2,000 paid $4 apiece to see Farrakan, who
received $10,000 plus travel expenses from the two groups
sponsoring the appearance: the Organization of Black Consciousness
and the predominantly white Penn Political Union.

   Here, at a glance, are the main features of the agreement to
withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The provisions, outlined
before the signing today in Geneva, include:
   
   _Withdrawal of all Soviet troops within nine months starting May
15, with half the total gone by Aug. 15.
   _Pledges by Pakistan and Afghanistan of non-interference in each
other's affairs.
   _Voluntary return of about 5 million Afghan refugees from
Pakistan and Iran.
   _Supervision of the settlement and the return of refugees by the
United Nations.
   _Guarantees from the United States and Soviet Union of
Afghanistan's future non-alignment.
   
   In addition, a U.S.-Soviet understanding will allow Washington
to continue military aid to the Afghan guerrillas, and Moscow to
continue sending arms to the Afghan government.

   There's not much you can buy for a
penny these days. But with 1,000,131 of them, you can make your way
into the Guinness Book of World Records.
   This weekend, a local group trying to raise money for a $40,000
playground will try to lay down at least that many coins in a high
school gymnasium to set a world record in length for a line of
pennies.
   Volunteers plan to begin creating 58 lanes 3 feet wide and 44
feet long on the gym floor Friday night. When they are finished
sometime Saturday, they hope to have 1,540,500 pennies set down in
rows an inch apart, creating a line 13.66 miles long.
   The Guinness-recognized record is 1,000,130 one-cent coins put
down in a 12.29-mile line Nov. 15, 1985, by students at Blacktown
Girls' High School in New South Wales, Australia.
   ``We figured out that, in order to accomplish the whole thing in
a 12-hour period, we would have to lay down something like 30
pennies a second,'' volunteer coordinator Carolyn Smith said.
   Coordinators have lined up 30 people for each two-hour shift of
penny-laying. The group also has planned ahead how to get the
pennies picked up after the record attempt.
   ``We'll start vacuuming them up on Sunday morning,'' said
volunteer Martha Wolf.
   The group received donations for the effort from children,
businesses and service groups. One problem, however, was that the
three banks in Fort Madison only keep about $300 each in pennies at
one time.
   The banks arranged for 800,000 pennies to be shipped in by
armored car from Davenport, and paid $1,000 to have the pennies
wrapped and shipped, which took about three weeks.

   State officials aren't quite ready to
file for a patent, but they're definitely taking a ``pro-pie-tary''
interest in Key lime pie.
   Under a bill approved in committee Wednesday, the creamy
concoction would be designated the official state pie. Key lime
pie, legislators explain, is ``properly'' made only with limes from
the Florida Keys.
   State symbols are serious business in identity-conscious
Florida, which already has a state tree, beverage, shell, stone,
gem, animal, freshwater and saltwater fish, marine and saltwater
mammal, air fair, festival and litter control symbol.
   In 1987, lawmakers designated the American alligator as the
official state reptile.
   According to a committee staff analysis, ``by being officially
designated, the Key lime pie would be in greater demand, thereby
promoting this fruit unique to Florida.''
   The Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the House
Community Affairs Committee voted 5-0 for the bill, which must be
now be approved by the full House.

   Here in question and answer form is a discussion
of the Afghanistan agreement:
   Q: Who is involved in the settlement?
   A: Signing the documents were the Soviet-supported Afghan
government in Kabul and neighboring Pakistan, in which 3 million
Afghan refugees live, with the United States and the Soviet Union
signing as guarantors.
   The mujahedeen gurrellias who have been fighting the Afghan
government and the Soviet troops in Afghanistan have not signed and
have vowed to carry on their struggle to establish an Islamic
government.
   Iran, which shelters about 2 million Afghan refugees, did not
participate in the Geneva talks.
   Q: What is in the four-part accord?
   A: The text of the accord was being published only after the
signing, but U.N mediator Diego Cordovez and spokesman for the
parties involved outlined the provisions.
   The documents include Afghan-Pakistani agreements for
non-interference and non-intervention in each other's affairs and
for the safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees. Another part
are U.S. and Soviet declarations guaranteeing Afghanistan's future
non-alignment and the rest of the settlement.
   A fourth document sets the timetable for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops and ties the other three together.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said the pullout of an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops will begin May 15. The process is
to be completed within nine months but Moscow has indicated it
hopes to bring the last soldier home early.
   Q: How will compliance be monitored?
   A: An annex sets up a U.N. supervisory role for the settlement.
About 50 United Nations officers in Afghanistan and Pakistan will
monitor implementation until two months after all refugees return.
The repatriation will be overseen by the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees.
   Q: Will the settlement stop the civil war?
   A: The mujahedeen alliance of Moslem guerrillas says it will
continue fighting until Soviet troops leave and the Marxist Kabul
government is overthrown. The Kabul government has said it will
continue to exercise power. Both sides are well armed and believed
capable of carrying on the fighting.
   Pakistan is convinced the bloodshed will not end, and the
refugees will not return, until the creation of an interim Afghan
government. The Soviet Union says Afghanistan's political future is
for its people to decide.
   Q: What about superpower support of the rivals?
   A: The accords say nothing about that. But the superpowers have
reached an understanding allowing both to continue aid _ the Soviet
Union to the Kabul government and the United States to the
mujahedeen. Diplomats have said the understanding is that arms
shipments will be phased out, with each superpower reserving the
right to resume arms supplies if the other does so.

<HEAD>DEA Agents Will Carry More Firepower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents fighting America's war against drugs
got a hefty boost of firepower Wednesday with the announcement here
that they will carry semi-automatic submachine guns.
   Each of South Florida's 341 Drug Enforcement Administration
agents will be issued a 9mm Colt semi-automatic submachine gun that
will fire three bursts every time an agent pulls the trigger,
officials said.
   The increased firepower was welcome news for DEA agents who
until now had to go into battle carrying six-shot, .38-caliber
handguns and shotguns against drug dealers firing 50 and 100 rounds
a pop from fully automatic Uzi and Mac-10 machine guns.
   DEA spokesman Jack Hook called it parity.
   ``It gives you a sense of confidence we never had in Miami in
the last 10 years with the .38 revolver. Anybody who levels a gun
at a DEA agent now is going to have some problems,'' said Hook.
   All 3,000 DEA agents will be issued submachine guns as quickly
as possible, officials said, but South Florida was chosen to be
first because it is a mecca for drug dealers.
   From October to January, the DEA seized 31 machine guns
nationally. Of those, 11 were seized in South Florida.
   The Colt SMG weighs 5.75 pounds and is nearly 29 inches long.
DEA's version is modified to carry a clip of 32 rounds of 9mm
ammunition.
   The DEA is not using fully automatic guns because of concerns
about the safety of bystanders, Hook said. Automatic guns tend to
spray wildly and have muzzles that are difficult to control, he
said.
   The DEA is the first federal agency to routinely issue
submachine guns. Customs and FBI still carry .38- and .357-caliber
weapons.
   As of Wednesday, all DEA agents were also issued 15-shot 9mm
automatic sidearms as their primary, personal weapons. The
submachine gun is considered secondary firepower.
   The price of the guns was not disclosed. Hook said that was a
government secret.

<TEXT>
   The government authorized the use of
contraceptives to help control population growth and the spread of
disease.
   The move was regarded as significant in a predominantly Moslem
country of 7 million people, where the use of contraceptives has
been illegal without a doctor's prescription since independence
from France in 1960.
   The government said on Wednesday the use of condoms, diaphragms
and spercmicides would no longer require a doctor's prescription.
The communique did not say if the government also would begin
distributing contraceptives.
   Niger, located in the arid West African Sahel, suffers from
recurring serious food shortages related to drought and poor farm
land.
   Its population is growing at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. The
government has predicted the population will grow to 10 million by
the year 2000.

   Thousands of people were evacuated from one of
London's busiest shopping districts after an odor thought to be
caused by a gas leak permeated the area, police said.
   Three hours after clearing a 1 square mile area of Oxford Street
on Wednesday, city gas officials determined a gas leak had not
occurred. The cause of the smell was not determined, a police
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who was not named in keeping with British custom,

it was diesel (fuel oil) leaking from a bus, but no one knows.''

<TEXT>
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, who visited
drought-stricken Ethiopia recently, joined UNICEF officials in
calling for help in the battle against world hunger.
   ``To save a single child is a blessing... to save millions of
children is a God-given opportunity presented to us by UNICEF,''
the 58-year-old actress said Wednesday at a news conference.
   Lawrence Bruce, the international children's fund president and
chief executive, announced UNICEF's latest drive to raise $22
million for medicine, vaccines and other non-food relief.
   ``We have the means of cutting by half the present global death
rate of 38,000 children each day ... and I find it unconscionable
that these children should die of preventable causes,'' Bruce said.
   Hepburn's eyes glistened with tears as she described the poor,
starving children she saw in Ethiopia while accompanying Bruce for
five days in mid-March.
   She noted that as an adolescent in Holland after World War II,
she was the recipient of food from a United Nations relief agency.
   ``Without that nutrition, my health might well have been
impaired for life,'' she said.

   Detectives arrested 14 police officers
working at police checkpoints around Lagos for allegedly demanding
bribes from motorists, a Lagos newspaper reported.
   The detectives raided several checkpoints Tuesday on a 20-mile
span of highway between Lagos and Ogun state, the National Concord
reported. One of the officers arrested was an assistant police
superintendent.
   The equivalent of $75 in Nigerian currency was found under the
floor mat of a squad car at one checkpoint, the newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   Authorities began a crackdown on police corruption because of
complaints from the public and recent violent anti-police
demonstrations in Lagos.

<HEAD>2 Companies Accused Of Violating Embargo With Defense-Related
Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities unsealed three indictments
Wednesday involving two companies accused of selling radar
navigational equipment to Iran in violation of a U.S. embargo.
   The companies named in the indictments are Marsh Aviation Co.,
of Mesa, Ariz., and Beechcraft Vertrieb Und Service company of
Munich, West Germany, said U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez at a news
conference.
   Marsh's owner, Floyd Stilwell, 61, of Phoenix, Ariz., was
arrested Wednesday in Phoenix and arraigned on charges of
exportation of defense articles, conspiracy to export items to
Iran, and making false statements to authorities, Nunez said.
   Hans Schneider, 57, who owns Beechcraft Vertrieb Und Service, is
charged with conspiracy to export equipment to Iran, exportation of
defense articles, and making false statements to authorities, he
said.
   The indictments were the result of an investigation prompted by
a tip from Teledyne Ryan Electronics of San Diego and aided by two
West Germans who have pleaded guilty to related charges, he said.
   The charges against both companies and their owners stem from
the alleged diversion of U.S.-made equipment from West Germany to
Iran, which shops around the world for military equipment for its
war with Iraq.
   An export embargo on U.S.-made equipment was first placed on
Iran by President Carter during the height of the American hostage
crisis.
   Stilwell allegedly submitted false export information to
Teledyne Ryan, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Customs
Service, in an attempt to conceal that the equipment's final
destination was Iran.
   Stilwell, who was arraigned in Phoenix on Wednesday, is
scheduled to be extradited to San Diego to appear in court Monday.
   The Sept. 25, 1987, indictment against Schneider accuses him of
directing his managing director, Bernd Pleuger, to continue
negotiating and servicing Iranian contracts with the illegal
diversion of equipment through their company.
   Schneider's company sells service and distributes parts for
Beechcraft Aircraft Corp. of Wichita, Kan., and other aircraft part
manufacturers.
   Nunez said he doubted that Schneider will be extradited to stand
trial in San Diego because the offenses he faces do not warrant
extradition under the West German extradition treaty.
   Pleuger, 51, of Stuttgarde, West Germany, and A. Juergen
Zimmermann, 37, of Augsberg, West Germany, have pleaded guilty to
conspiracy charges in the case and have been cooperating in the
investigation, Nunez said.

<HEAD>Effort To Get Organs From Doomed Babies Continues Under New Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital will continue to harvest
organs for transplant from babies born with most of their brains
missing, despite a prior announcement that the program had been
suspended, officials said.
   Dick Schaefer, a spokesman for Loma Linda University Medical
Center, said Wednesday he was mistaken when he announced earlier in
the week that the hospital's program of keeping such babies alive
had been temporarily halted until new guidelines could be issued.
   On Tuesday night, hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell issued a
statement saying the program to admit anencephalic babies ``is to
continue without interruption.''
   The hospital's policy was slightly revised, however, so that
such babies will be placed on respirators only if their heart rates
slow or they have trouble breathing, Schaefer said from the
hospital 60 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Anencephalic babies _ those missing most of their brains _
inevitably die within days to weeks. Loma Linda's experimental and
so-far unsuccesful program is aimed at using such infants as organ
donors to save the lives of babies who otherwise would die of fatal
heart defects or other deadly ailments.
   Previously, the hospital's policy was to place the anencephalic
babies on respirators as soon as they were admitted to the hospital
so their organs wouldn't deteriorate as they died.
   A seven-day limit for keeping them on the respirators was
established to counter criticisms that the doomed anencephalic
babies were suffering only to benefit infants who need transplants.
   The revised life-support policy, which still maintains the
seven-day limit, apparently is aimed at increasing the proportion
of babies who can be declared brain-dead.
   Schaefer said Wednesday his earlier statement ``was a
misunderstanding on my part. I assumed that the program wouldn't be
started until the statement (of revised policy) was released.''
   Only one of the first six anencephalic babies admitted to Loma
Linda, Hope Lovette Mount, of Knoxville, Tenn., remained alive
Wednesday. She was taken off life-support Monday and will be
allowed to die, Schaefer said.

   An Atlanta-based organization for terminally ill
children has given out 100 tickets to pop star Michael Jackson's
concert here tonight, but needs a few more tickets to meet the
number they were asked to get.
   ``Once the word came out that we had tickets, the phone was
ringing off the hook,'' Linda Dozoretz of the Children's Wish
Foundation said Wednesday.
   Ms. Dozoretz said the organization needs 24 more tickets to
fulfill every request it got. ``We're trying to see what we can
do,'' she said. ``It would be a wonderful experience.''
   The group, which grants wishes to terminally ill children, was
awaiting confirmation from Jackson's staff on whether he will be
able to meet some of the children, Ms. Dozoretz said.
   Jackson brought his solo tour to Atlanta on Wednesday for three
sold-out shows.

   Cuban leader Fidel Castro has been honored by
the World Health Organization for giving up his famous cigar and
setting a smoke-free example for his countrymen, Cuba's official
news agency says.
   Castro was given two medals by Carlyle Guerra de Macedo,
director general of the Geneva-based organization, in a ceremony
Tuesday at Havana's Palace of the Revolution, said Prensa Latina in
a dispatch received here Wednesday.
   The WHO announced the honor on April 7, the first worldwide ``No
Tobacco Day.'' Castro, whose cigars were almost as much a trademark
as his beard, was cited for pledging in 1981 never to smoke in
public and subsequently quitting.

   Counterculture journalist Hunter S.
Thompson canceled tonight's scheduled speaking engagement at the
University of Arizona because of alleged death threats, his agent
says.
   Thompson, 48, who lives near Aspen, Colo., has received numerous
telephone threats in the past week, agent Greg Werckman said
Wednesday in New York City.
   Thompson, creator of so-called ``gonzo'' journalism, has written
several books, including ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' and
``The Great White Shark Hunt.''
   Thompson has developed a reputation for rowdy behavior and
drinking on the speaking tour, and his appearance initially had
been opposed by student leaders.
   Werckman said Thompson was disappointed at having to cancel, but
has taken the threats seriously. Werckman said he did not know the
source of the threats, but that the writer previously had been
threatened by someone in Tucson.

   Singer Deborah Harry, songwriter Irving Berlin,
jazz musician Lionel Hampton, and transsexual tennis coach Renee
Richards are among dozens of celebrities who owe back taxes to New
York state, a newspaper says.
   Miss Harry owes $241,354 for record royalties and Berlin owes
$5,500, according to state records cited by the New York Post on
Wednesday.
   Richards, an ophthalmologist, owes nearly $33,000 and master
vibraphonist Hampton's Lionel Hampton Enterprises owes $10,500 in
withholding taxes, the paper said.
   The records also showed the state was seeking almost $289,000
from the estate of jazz great Duke Ellington and more than $91,000
from the estate of singer Brook Benton, who died Saturday.
   On Monday, movie reviewer Rex Reed pleaded guilty to evading
more than $20,000 in state income taxes.
   A secretary for Berlin denied that the 99-year-old songwriter
owed taxes. Hampton's manager, Bill Titone, said the tax problem
was cleared up in 1987. A secretary for Richards said the issue was
being handled by Richards' lawyer, according to the Post.
   Miss Harry's lawyer, Gary Kurfirst, said the singer was repaying
her debt in installments and would owe no money by the end of the
year.

   A months-long recall effort to oust Mayor Federico
Pena failed Wednesday when an elections official announced that
petitions submitted fell more than 2,000 names short of the number
required by law.
   The backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to
the Denver Election Commission Wednesday afternoon, beating a 5
p.m. deadline by several hours.
   They said they believed there were enough valid signatures to
support calling a new mayoral election.
   But late Wednesday, Felicia Muftic, president of the Denver
Election Commission, said that even without checking for validity,
the number of signatures was only 36,960.
   For a recall, the petitions would have to bear the valid
signatures of 39,091 registered Denver voters, which is 25 percent
of the number of votes cast in the last mayoral election, said Sam
Tarkington, executive director of the Election Commission.
   ``It appears that unofficially there's just not enough
signatures to continue,'' Muftic said.
   Pena, 41, one of the first Hispanics to be mayor of a major U.S.
city, reacted immediately with pleasure.
   ``The time for negativism and doubt is behind us. To those
people who opposed the recall I thank you. To those who supported
the recall I urge you to join with the city to help move the city
forward. These are critical times facing our city and we can't
afford to have disunity,'' he said at a news conference at his
office late Wednesday.
   Recall organizer Marge Doty said earlier Wednesday that she had
no exact count on the number of signatures, but said she was
confident there were ``more than enough'' to continue the recall
process.
   Doty, who launched the recall effort in January, requested a
police escort to and from the Election Commission office after she
reported receiving threats.
   The recall drive was started by a group angry over what its
members claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the Pena
administration. The group gathered support among residents stranded
for several days by a major holiday snowstorm when maintenance
crews plowed only major traffic arteries while Pena was vacationing
out of state.
   While there is some dispute about precise procedures, Denver's
charter calls for an entirely new, nonpartisan election if the
petitions are validated to recall Pena, a second-term Democrat.
   Any candidate who collected 300 names on a nominating petition
could run, and if no candidate mustered a clear majority, a run-off
would be held next.
   There have been hints of illegalities in the petition campaign.
Pena appeared on a KOA radio call-in show Wednesday morning, and
one caller informed him her daughter had been approached by
petitioners. The daughter said she was told she ``had to sign,''
and when she said she was not a Denver resident, she was allegedly
told, ``We'll give you a Denver address.''

   The hijacking of a Kuwait Airways jumbo
jet is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks in the Middle
East and Europe that began when Kuwait convicted 17 pro-Iranian
bombers in 1984.
   Since those men _ all but one of them Shiite Moslems _ were put
behind bars, their comrades have hijacked airliners, kidnapped
Americans and other foreigners and carried out bombing attacks and
assassinations.
   The Shiites who hijacked Kuwait Airways Flight 422 on April 5
have one demand: the release of the 17 men convicted of a series of
bombings in Kuwait in December 1983 that killed five people and
wounded 61. Kuwait refuses.
   The bombings were part of an Iranian-inspired campaign to
destabilize Kuwait, which has a substantial Shiite minority, and
which Tehran accuses of helping Iraq in their 7{-year-old war.
   Dozens of other Shiites have been jailed in Kuwait for bombings,
but no one has demanded their release.
   ``There's a thread running through all these events that began
with the 1983 bombings,'' Ian Geldard of the London-based Institute
for the Study of Terrorism said in a telephone interview.
   He and other specialists traced the chain of violence to one
mastermind, Imad Mughniyeh, 36, a Lebanese Shiite who is a security
chief of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, an umbrella organization whose
name means Party of God.
   Among the 17, three have been sentenced to death. One of the
three is Elias Saab, whose real name is Mustapha Youssef Badreddin.
He is Mughniyeh's cousin and brother-in-law.
   ``At the end of the day, it's Mughniyeh who's been responsible
for most of this violence,'' Geldard said.
   Some passengers freed by the hijackers of the Kuwaiti jet said a
man boarded the plane last week when it landed at Mashhad in
northeast Iran shortly after being seized.
   Palestinian negotiatiors in Cyprus, where the plane flew next,
said the hijackers' leader, who they called ``experienced,'' never
showed himself and they speculated that he might be Mughniyeh. The
plane later flew to Algeria where the hijackers refused to free
their 32 remaining hostages.
   Mughniyeh disappeared in Beirut, where he has his headquarters,
several weeks ago after returning from Iran, informed souces said
on condition of anonymity.
   Another leading Shiite militant in Lebanon, Hussein Musawi,
leader of Islamic Amal which is linked to Hezbollah, also has been
involved in the violence, Geldard said.
   One of Musawi's cousins, Hassan Youssef Musawi, is among the 17
held in Kuwait and is serving a life sentence.
   ``The family connections involved here are the reason there's
been such a passionate intensity involved in this campaign,''
Geldard said.
   The 17 are members of the Iranian-based al-Dawaa, or The Call, a
movement of dissident Iraqi Shiite fundamentalists opposed to the
Baghdad government of President Saddam Hussein. Al-Dawaa is closely
linked with Hezbollah.
   In Baghdad in 1980, Hussein publicly beheaded the movement's
founder Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric and close friend of
Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   U.S. and Lebanese intelligence officials said Mughniyeh and his
clan were behind the kidnappings of Americans and Frenchmen in
Lebanon that began in 1984.
   Intelligence organizations consider Hezbollah, al-Dawaa and
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, one and the same, part of an
increasingly potent terrorist network that leads to Tehran.
   Here are some of the events that stemmed from the conviction of
the 17 bombers.
   _Dec. 4, 1984: Five Arabs hijack a Kuwaiti airliner and demand
the release of the 17. They fly the plane to Tehran and kill two
American passengers. Iranian security men storm the plane after
five days and capture the hijackers, who later vanish. Western
intelligence believes the Iranians let them go.
   _March 16, 1985: Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press is kidnapped in Beirut by
Islamic Jihad. Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are
now held in Lebanon.
   _May 4, 1985: Islamic Jihad warns there will be ``catastrophic
consequences'' if Kuwait does not free the 17.
   _May 25, 1985: The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, narrowly escapes assasination when a Shiite suicide
bomber rams a car loaded with explosives into his motorcade in
Kuwait. Two of the emir's bodyguards and the bomber were killed.
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.
   _June 14, 1985: Shiites hijack a TWA airliner and fly it to
Beirut, demanding the release of the 17 and more than 700 Arabs
held by Israel. A U.S. Navy diver is killed and 39 Americans held
hostage for 17 days before being freed after Syrian intervention.
U.S. authorities name Mughniyeh as one of the suspected hijackers.
   _July 24, 1987: After a string of bombings in Kuwait, a
21-year-old Lebanese Shiite member of Hezbollah, Hussein Hariri,
hijacks an Air Afrique jetliner to Zurich, demanding the release in
West Germany of another Shiite held there for the TWA hijacking.
The plane's crew overwhelm Hariri after he kills a French passenger.

<HEAD>Annual Spawning Brings Smelt And Fish Stories To Chicago Lakefront</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   On spring nights, pearls of light from lanterns
and campfires sparkle along Chicago's dark seawalls and breakwaters
as thousands of people wait for tiny silvery fish to wander into
their nets.
   The smelt are spawning again, a decades-old rite of spring that
is part social event, part business and part recreation along the
Great Lakes during the six-week season from April 1 to May 15.
   Smelting is almost a way of life.
   ``I've been doing it for 30 years, and I've run through friends,
family, my kids _ nobody loves it quite as much as I do,'' said
Herman Telkamp, who staked out his spot four hours before he could
legally lower his net at 7 p.m.
   ``My wife won't clean fish anymore, so I spend all night
smelting and all day cleaning.''
   Rainbow smelt, 6- to 8-inch members of a family resembling the
trout, have been eaten in Europe and Canada for centuries.
   In the Midwest, the rite began after 1912, when the smelt,
orginally a salt-water fish, escaped into the Great Lakes from a
small lake in Michigan where they had been stocked.
   The best smelting at Montrose Harbor was on the breakwater,
which was lined with Vietnamese, Cambodian and Korean families, and
a few Polish immigrants.
   Fathers lower and raise the nets, children pull the fish from
the mesh and mothers gut and clean.
   ``A lot of those fish are going to Argyle Street,'' said one
onlooker, referring to a nearby neighborhood with Vietnamese and
Cambodian restaurants.
   With the right water temperature, current and wind, the smelt
head in from open waters in great numbers. Chicago smelters run
their square gill nets out on anchored ropes, raising the nets
several times an hour.
   Nightly yields can reach 5,000 fish a person, but on nights when
the fish are fewer, it's time for six-packs and smelt stories. Like
the one Rob Ohagan, 24, of Darien, tells about the tipsy smelter
who weighted his net with his keys.
   ``A lot of guys fish without licenses and just abandon their
nets when the wardens come by,'' Ohagan said. ``They figure it's
cheaper to lose a $35 smelt rig than to pay a $50 fine.
   ``This guy remembered that his keys were on the net, and he
couldn't get into his car, so he had to take the fine,'' Ohagan
said.
   There's also the matter of upholding a tradition observed by
younger smelters: biting the head off the first smelt of the season.
   Ed Flowers, 25, of La Grange, pulled up his first net of the
spring and saluted the four dangling fish with a beer, but he
wouldn't take the bite.
   ``Now you won't have any more luck,'' said Jim Falduto, 25, of
Park Ridge.
   Chuck Roth and his wife, Laurie, had set up a net, a fire and a
tent for their two young daughters, Nicole and Chris.
   ``We've been smelting about five years _ always at this very
same spot,'' Roth said. ``We only ran out of last year's frozen
smelt last month.''
   The Roths, of Park Forest, like their smelt marinated in
home-made hot sauce, but Larry Wolfgang, also casting his net along
the breakwater, cooks his in a beer batter.
   ``I keep a couple of gallons for myself and give the rest away _
to friends or in the tavern,'' Wolfgang said. ``They're a lot
easier to give away than zucchini or tomatoes.''
   Wolfgang, 45, said this night he was catching a wedding present.
   ``My sister's getting married tomorrow in Eau Claire,
Wisconsin,'' he said. ``She likes smelt, but they're hard to come
by that far from the lakes.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: When a President's Words Are Not His Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Question: When are the president's words not
the president's words?
   Answer: A lot of the time.
   Past and present White House aides say former presidential
spokesman Larry Speakes went too far when he quoted President
Reagan as saying things in meetings the president didn't say.
   It is nevertheless common practice for press secretaries and
other aides to craft statements of various kinds which, usually
after being approved by the president, are issued in his name.
   ``The whole business of communication is the drafting of
materials that the president may use in one form or another,
whether it's a speech or a statement or quotes on a various issue
that tell what the president thinks,'' says White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``As long as it is approved by him and reflects his thinking and
so forth, that is what it is,'' Fitzwater told reporters Tuesday.
   ``It is the president's thinking.''
   But, said Fitzwater, it is wrong to attribute fabricated quotes
to the president in the way Speakes did it.
   Former presidential press secretaries made similar distinctions.
   ``You try to portray what the man is, what his thoughts are, and
you try to put them in words that would be his kind of words, but
you always have to rely on his approval of those speeches and those
words; that's a given,'' said Gerald ter Horst, who was President
Ford's first press secretary.
   Ron Ziegler, who was President Nixon's press secretary, said,
``It's common practice for press secretaries to develop quotes and
get somebody's approval. That's been practice since the beginning
of time.''
   Both ter Horst and Ziegler, however, said Speakes was out of
line. Why? What was he doing that was different?
   What he did, on one occasion, was to have an aide make up
quotes, polish the quotes himself, and then pass them off as things
the president said in his Geneva summit meeting with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Speakes defended the practice, saying, ``I think it was an
accurate reflection of the president's thinking, the way I
approached it. We talked many times in the preparation for the
summit, so I knew how he felt.''
   On another occasion, Speakes says he put words that were spoken
by Secretary of State George P. Shultz into the president's mouth
after a Korean Air Lines jet was shot down in 1983 with 61
Americans aboard.
   Any president has much of his material written for him by aides
who presumably help him to express his own view. There is a speech
writing department to turn out speeches for him. He goes into
meetings armed with talking points from which to speak. If he
misspeaks at a news conference, a clarifying statement, prepared by
aides, is issued in his name. When foreign journalists submit
questions in writing, the answers are in his name but are
staff-written.
   Even his answers at news conferences are frequently not
spontaneous. According to Speakes and others, the president is
given briefing books in question-and-answer form for study and
practice before each session.
   Reporters who cover the White House, however, know and often
report that such materials are written for the president. They did
not know, and were not able to report, that the quotes given them
by Speakes in Geneva were not actually spoken by Reagan.
   In addition, as George Reedy, former press secretary to Lyndon
Johnson noted, at least some of the Speakes-Reagan quotes were
fabricated in the context of a major international meeting.
   Bob Ellison, White House reporter for the Sheridan Broadcasting
Network, when asked whether he was surprised to find that the
quotes had been faked, replied, ``These quotes, yes. We're not
talking about the president speaking to the Jaycees or the Future
Farmers of America. We're talking about a meeting with Gorbachev.''

   President Reagan insists that he was never
aware his spokesman concocted quotes for him and says he is getting
tired of ``kiss-and-tell books'' written by his former aides.
   Reagan, answering questions at a meeting of the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, also said Jesse Jackson's policies have not
been scrutinized adequately in the Democratic presidential race
because it might be ``misinterpreted into some kind of racial
attack.''
   In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session on Wednesday, the
president commented for the first time on two issues _ the
sensitive topic of race in the 1988 presidential race and the
controversy over the new book by his former spokesman, Larry
Speakes.
   Speakes, in his book ``Speaking Out,'' reveals that he twice
gave quotes to the press corps claiming the words were Reagan's
when in fact they were not. One incident occurred after the downing
of a Korean Air Lines jet in 1983, and the other came during the
1985 Geneva summit between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   When the story surfaced earlier this week, Reagan aides
described the president as angry to learn of the deception.
Speakes, however, said in subsequent interviews that Reagan knew at
the time of the practice and did not object.
   On Wednesday, Reagan said, ``I was not aware of that and just
learned it recently, as all the rest of you did, and I can tell you
right now that I have no affection for these kiss-and-tell books
that are being written, and I find it entirely fiction.''
   Reagan did not directly answer the question of whether he
approved of the practice or would allow it to continue. His current
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, has condemned the practice.
   Reagan's reference to ``kiss-and-tell'' books evidently refers
not only to Speakes' book, but to ``Behind the Scenes,'' written by
his former deputy chief of staff, Michael K. Deaver, and a
forthcoming volume by former chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
   The president also was asked about Speakes' contention that he
``does not read many newspapers thoroughly.''
   ``Well, I begin with the comics,'' Reagan said, confirming part
of Speakes' account and drawing a laugh from his audience in the
process.
   The president said that was ``a lifetime habit,'' and that he
then turns to the editorial pages. He said he also looks through
news clippings prepared by his staff because of the volume of
papers published outside of Washington.
   ``But he's wrong when he implies that I don't read the papers.
Yes, I do,'' Reagan said.
   Later, discussing the presidential campaign and Jackson, Reagan
said: ``I hope that race will not be a part of this campaign in any
way.''
   Reagan went on to say of Jackson, ``It seems that more attention
is being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what
he is actually saying.
   ``And I have to believe that a great many of us would find
ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is
proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasn't
concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial
attack,'' Reagan said.
   Jackson has advocated deep cuts in Pentagon spending and an
array of costly social programs.
   Reagan acknowledged the Republican field is down to one
candidate, Vice President George Bush, but he did not give Bush his
endorsement, saying there still is a convention to be held.
   The president also refused to predict the outcome of the
Democratic contest.
   On other topics:
   _He said he expects Afghan rebels to continue fighting the
Marxist regime in Kabul despite an agreement being signed Thursday
for the withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet forces after an eight-year
occupation.
   Reagan said nothing in the agreement prevents the United States
from supplying the rebels ``as long as they need it and as long as
the Soviet Union continues to supply the Afghan forces in their
puppet government.''
   _Reagan said the U.S. banking system ``has some troubles.'' But
he also said, ``I don't think it is a problem that could suddenly
bring disaster down upon us.''

<HEAD>Shultz Confident Soviets Will Honor Afghan Agreement</HEAD>

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he is
confident the Soviets will keep their promise to withdraw from
Afghanistan under an agreement hailed as the first step toward
ending the bitter Afghan struggle.
   Shultz flew to Geneva today to join Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze at the ceremonial signing of a series of
settlement accords. Among them is a Soviet pledge to withdraw an
estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from Afghanistan.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze also plan to issue statements
reaffirming their nations' right to continue aiding the Afghan
factions _ assuring that the war will go on as a civil conflict.
   There was fresh evidence of continued warfare on the eve of the
signing.
   U.S. government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed reports from Western diplomats in Pakistan earlier in the
week that Soviet forces near Kabul were sent to relieve Gardez, a
beleaguered Afghan Army garrison south of the capital, amid fierce
fighting with U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   The units were said to consist of an undetermined number of
soldiers and 420 vehicles, including T-72 tanks, armored personnel
carriers and mobile rocket launchers.
   Gardez is 80 miles south of Kabul and 60 miles from Pakistan,
staging area for U.S. aid to the resistance.
   Mujahedeen guerrillas recently cut the road to Gardez, where a
Soviet special forces regiment is garrisoned, said one source.
   Another source said convoys of trucks also were sent into
Afghanistan from the Soviet Union in the past week, but it was not
clear if the trucks were filled with troops or were empty.
   Before leaving for Geneva, Shultz told members of House and
Senate foreign affairs committees that he had faith in the Soviet
promise, committee members said.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, one of Capitol Hill's ardent
champions of U.S. support for anti-Soviet guerrillas in
Afghanistan, said after meeting Shultz he accepted the assurances.
   ``The bottom line is that the Soviets are getting out,'' Wilson
said.
   Under the withdrawal agreement, the Soviets are supposed to pull
out 50 percent of their troops within 90 days, and the entire
contingent by Feb. 15, 1989.
   That would mark the end of a Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan that began with a December 1979 airlift of Red Army
forces into Kabul to back pro-Moscow Afghan leaders in their war
against insurgents. U.S. analysts believe the Red Army will pull
back from exposed positions and concentrate in Kabul and around the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
   The United States had hoped to reach agreement with the Soviets
to cut aid to both sides _ the U.S. backed guerrillas and the
Soviet-sponsored Afghan government _ but Moscow rebuffed an aid
cutoff and now both sides will continue arming their clients.
   Shultz said he hoped United Nations mediator Diego Cordovez, who
arranged the Soviet pullout, will be successful in arranging a
peace accord between the Afghans.
   Pakistan and the Afghan government have agreed under the accords
to stop interfering in each others' affairs and the superpowers are
signing the pact as ``guarantors.''
   Despite the likelihood of continued fighting, the prospect of a
Soviet withdrawal has been hailed by U.S. officials as a potential
milestone in superpower relations.
   Since 1979, the Carter and Reagan administrations have told the
Soviets that their continued presence in Afghanistan has made it
difficult for the United States to trust Soviet professions of
peaceful intent.

   At the immigration service, Assistant Commissioner Kennedy said
it was his job to recommend to Commissioner Alan C. Nelson whether
to stay in the Chester Arthur Building or move.
   If Nelson, a close friend of Meese's from the days when they
worked together in California, had demanded a move, the GSA would
have found a new building, according to Kennedy and GSA officials.
   But Kennedy recommended staying even though he was displeased
with the building management, particularly its maintenance of the
air system.
   ``At one point, a downtown, new building came on the market and
people thought about that for a while,'' Kennedy said. ``But when
you look at the logistics of uprooting your entire headquarters
staff for a month, it's not worth it.''
   Kennedy said other events tied his hands: The first immigration
reform bill in a generation was enacted Oct. 17, 1986.
   ``We couldn't even consider a move at that time, because of the
demands of the new act,'' Kennedy said. ``We had to get thousands
of new employees on board.''
   Kennedy said when he discussed the lease with Nelson ``there
were no options. When you look at the cost of moving and all that,
it's kind of the decision that doesn't have to be made.''
   But during this period, the immigration service outgrew Chester
Arthur; some employees were put in two other buildings, five and 10
blocks away.
   Kennedy says no one pressured him, and that he never heard
whether Meese had an opinion on the lease or about Ursula Meese's
salary being paid indirectly by the building owners.
   Sources familiar with McKay's investigation have said he is
interested in the role played by Meese's confidant and former
attorney, E. Robert Wallach, in obtaining the Benders' job offers
to Ursula Meese. Wallach has been indicted for allegedly trying to
peddle his influence with Meese in other matters.
   George Walker, Wallach's attorney, told The Washington Post that
Wallach played a peripheral role in Ursula Meese's taking the MS
job instead of the radio program. Walker did not return numerous
telephone calls over a week.
   Meanwhile, the man who sold Chester Arthur to the Bender
partnership still wonders why they bought it and gave him such a
good deal.
   ``We are still laughing because we did a very good deal there,''
said Dirk van Westreenen, president of Dutch Property Investment,
Ltd. The sale price more than tripled his $12 million investment
five years earlier.
   He decided to sell because ``the GSA gave us notice that they
wanted to get rid of a floor and a half. That was the risk: Are
they going to stay? Who is going to take this space, because it is
not first-class space and it is not a first-class location?''
   Of Howard Bender, Van Westreenen said, ``I don't know how much
of a gamble it was, but he took the gamble that we didn't want to
take.''

   A real estate developer whose family pays for
the salary of Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula, was
granted a $50 million lease renewal on a building the government
said risked the health and safety of Justice Department workers.
   Thirteen days after obtaining the new lease, the developer and
his partners sold the building for $22.6 million more than they had
paid for it two years earlier _ a 60 percent profit, according to
District of Columbia land records.
   The developer, Howard S. Bender, was the principal owner of the
building in late 1985 when the Bender Foundation, his family's
tax-exempt philanthropy, donated $120,000 to the Multiple Sclerosis
Society to hire Ursula Meese at $40,000-a-year for three years, the
society's lawyer said.
   The lease _ a renewal at more than three times the previous rent
_ was signed even though the landlord had not cleaned up an air
system environmental inspectors said was a health hazard that could
explain above-average sickness there, according to government
documents.
   And the lease was signed even though the easy public access
required by another tenant ``jeopardizes (Justice's) ability to
provide adequate security ... and increass the opportunity for
sabotage and other covert activities,'' a government document said.
   An attorney for the Meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part
in the transactions, but acknowledges that the Benders and Meeses
know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss the matter. A key
government official said Meese played no role in the real estate
decision.
   But the MS society's records on Mrs. Meese's job have been
subpoenaed by independent counsel James McKay as part of his
investigation into whether Meese committed federal crimes,
according to James Bierbower, attorney for the MS Society.
   Federal law makes it a felony for a federal official to take any
governmental action that would affect the financial status of his
spouse. Further, a presidential order forbids federal officials
from conduct that might give the appearance of a conflict of
interest, even where one does not exist.
   The seven-story Chester Arthur Building on the rundown fringe of
downtown Washington houses the headquarters of the Justice
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   In March 1985, Bender, vice president of the Bender Foundation,
and other investors acquired the building at an apparently
inauspicious moment in its history.
   Public records show that Bender and his associates paid $37.5
million _ nearly twice the assessed value _ for the building.
   At the time, the building's most valuable asset was the federal
lease, which was due to expire within a year and would be put up
for bids by other landlords.
   In fact, the federal government had already taken steps to move
out.
   On Aug. 8, 1984, Congress had approved a Reagan administration
plan, pushed by then-Attorney General William French Smith, to
begin moving some federal offices out of the building. The plan
called for a new lease there in 1986 for only 63 percent of the
space the government had before.
   However, three months after the Bender partnership bought the
building, the administration told Congress that its plans had
changed dramatically.
   In June 1985, the General Services Administration _ the
government's housekeeping agency _ notified Congress it wanted to
keep the immigration service in the full 264,000 square feet at
Chester Arthur.
   That same month, immigration officials complained of illnesses
among INS employees apparently caused by the building's air system.
   On Sept. 26, 1985, assistant immigration commissioner James
Kennedy formally requested an environmental inspection from the
General Services Administration.
   Against this background, in the fall of 1985, the Benders made
two separate efforts to get Mrs. Meese on a payroll.
   First, they tried to interest Mrs. Meese in a public affairs job
at their radio station, WWDC, which has a rock-and-roll format, but
Mrs. Meese declined, MS attorney Bierbower said.
   Then, in October 1985, the Bender Foundation indicated it would
contribute $120,000 to the MS society for a development director,
Bierbower said.
   ``There was no question that MS had in mind that Ursula would
become the development director'' at the time the Bender Foundation
put up the money for the position, Bierbower said. ``We were after
Ursula Meese.'' She had previously worked there as a volunteer.
   Howard Bender's wife, Sondra, is president of the family
foundation and a member of the MS Society board.
   Mrs. Meese, 56, a former probation officer in Oakland, Calif.,
has done mostly volunteer work since coming to Washington with her
husband in 1981. She also has worked as the paid executive director
of the William Moss Institute, a foundation to study the future.
   Meanwhile, the Chester Arthur lease negotiations dragged on
during 1986. Finally, on May 14, 1987, after the Bender partnership
promised to clean up the air system, the government signed a new
lease for 259,000 square feet.
   The 10-year lease was worth $50 million. On May 27, the Bender
partnership sold the building for $60.1 million cash, public
records show.
   One of the new owners, asking not to be identified by name, said
the new lease ``was clearly one of the most desirable things from
our standpoint.''
   Bender family members referred all questions to attorney Seymour
Glanzer, who said, ``I'm not going to answer your questions. I have
no comment.''
   James Rocap, an attorney for the Meeses, denied the attorney
general played any role in the decision to renew the lease. ``He
was aware that the lease was up and so on, but that's it. He had no
involvement in the lease matter in any substantive way. There is no
indication that the Meeses had anything to do with his (Bender's)
making $22 million.''

<HEAD>Student Judicial Board Disallows Election</HEAD>

   A student judicial board at the University
of Massachusetts Wednesday declared invalid an election in which an
avowed communist and another student were chosen as co-presidents
of the student body.
   The board said the constitution of the Student Government
Association prohibited more than one person from holding the
presidency.
   ``Only one person can run for and hold the office of SGA
president,'' the three-member student court said in an opinion
issued late Wednesday night.
   The student court, whose decisions are binding on the student
government, ordered a new election. A date was not immediately set.
   Student attorney general William Collins asked the court to
declare the Jason Rabinowitz-Shari Silkoff ticket invalid because
of the joint candidacy.
   Rabinowitz, a 20-year-old member of the Young Communist League,
is believed to be the first such member elected campus president
since the group was formed five years ago. He and Silkoff, also 20
and a self-described progressive, were elected March 15 with 1,454
votes, 391 more than conservative candidate Aram Hamparian at the
19,000-student campus.
   ``This was a travesty of justice,'' Rabinowitz said after the
decision was announced. ``We're going to beat this. We want to
fight for the rights of the students.''
   A professor who testified at the hearing last week on behalf of
Rabinowitz and Silkoff said the constitution's language about the
presidency was vague.
   ``It could be read in different ways,'' said political science
professor Dean Alfange said.
   On whether it prohibited co-presidents, he said: ``That language
does not necessarily mean that to me, as a layman reading this
document.''
   Conservatives in the student senate had filibustered last week
to keep the election from being ratified and to stop Rabinowitz and
Silkoff from taking office.

   Sen. Ted Stevens thinks it's time to remember
what he calls ``a forgotten piece of history.''
   ``Well, at least it's forgotten down here, but certainly not
back home,'' says the Alaska Republican. ``A lot of people down
here in the lower 48 think we're overseas, we're some kind of
foreign country.''
   The history to which Stevens referred is the little-known role
played by Alaska in World War II, when the Aleutian Islands were
invaded and occupied by Japanese troops for 14 months until the
summer of 1943.
   It was the first time since the War of 1812 that a foreign
nation had occupied American territory.
   The story is eloquently told in ``Alaska at War,'' which will
air April 25 on the Public Broadcasting System. The one-hour film,
written and produced by Laurence Goldin for the Alaska Historical
Commission, was previewed Wednesday in a Senate hearing room at a
reception hosted by Stevens and other Alaska legislators.
   In 1942, Alaska was a U.S. territory, still 17 years away from
statehood. It was largely undeveloped, a frontier land where
conditions were primitive and life was hard. There were few paved
roads and little development.
   Goldin, a New York native who has lived in Alaska since 1970,
spent two years making the film, spending much of that time digging
up rare historical footage. Among the film he used was rare color
footage taken by the late director John Huston.
   Alaska came under attack on June 3, 1942, when Japanese planes
bombed the U.S. base at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians chain.
Although damage was relatively light, 25 Americans were killed.
   The attack was part of the overall Japanese drive on Midway
Island, the small but vital American outpost in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean. The Aleutian attack was intended as a feint, a move
designed to draw away from Midway some of the already thin American
forces which were still reeling from the attack on Pearl Harbor six
months before.
   But unknown to the Japanese, American intelligence had broken
Japanese codes and didn't fall for the Aleutian gambit. Instead,
Adm. Chester Nimitz concentrated his forces at Midway and dealt the
Japanese Navy a crushing attack in one of history's greatest sea
battles. Japan never recovered.
   While the Japanese Navy was reeling at Midway, Japanese army
troops were landing in June 1942 on two Aleutian islands at the
western end of the far-flung chain. About 2,600 troops landed on
Attu and another 5,600 at Kiska, 200 miles away.
   For the next year, as Goldin's film makes clear, American
bombers steadily pounded the two Japanese installations, but were
unable to dislodge the invaders.
   One tragic footnote was the forced removal of about 900 Aleut
Indians to a new home 2,000 miles away. But conditions at the new
location were harsh and preparations were few; many of the Aleuts
died. ``Many people don't realize what was done to the Aleuts. It's
time their story was told,'' Stevens said.
   In the spring of 1943, U.S. forces prepared to retake the two
Aleutian islands and the decision was made to attack the smaller
base at Attu.
   On May 11, 1943, 11,000 American troops invaded Attu under
dreadful weather conditions. What was supposed to be a three-day
job took three weeks of often-brutal fighting through the rocky
hills and valleys of the desolate island.
   When the Japanese on Attu realized they were surrounded, the
hundreds of soldiers remaining alive committed suicide, a fact well
documented by the film. Only 29 of the 2,600 Japanese troops
survived; American casualties totaled 549.
   Two months later, under cover of fog, the Japanese Navy was able
to evacuate its base on Kiska.
   Even now, Attu remains a little-visited place, and for good
reason, Stevens noted.
   ``There are still a lot of Japanese relics out there,'' he said.
``We believe there are some unexploded shells on the island, so
people are kept away. We considered making it a historic site, but
it would cost a fortune to sanitize it and so the job has never
been done.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Farm Economy `Has Turned the Corner'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analysis says the
recovery in farmland prices is putting a healthy glow back into the
financial complexion of American farmers.
   When new figures based on readings as of Feb. 1 are released,
they are expected to show the average price of farmland is up
nationally for the first time in six years, although there are
still areas where land values are lagging.
   Meanwhile, the department's Economic Research Service says that
as stability returned last year to farm real estate _ which
includes land and buildings _ the financial returns to farmers as a
share of equity ``became positive'' for the first time since 1980.
   Equity, the value difference between assets and debts, plummeted
34 percent to $536.6 billion in 1986 from $814.4 billion in 1981.
   Land values, the mainstay of farm assets, plunged $256 billion
between 1981 and 1986, especially in the Corn Belt and Northern
Plains states.
   ``As land values declined, more and more borrowers were unable
to pay existing obligations without restructuring their debts or
selling their assets,'' the report said. ``Even some farms with
positive cash flows were considered poor credit risks because of
low or negative equity positions.''
   The report added: ``An improved land market in the remainder of
the 1980s represents an important indicator that the agricultural
economy has turned the corner.''
   One measure of the importance of the land market to U.S.
agriculture is the agency's computations on the total return to
equity from farm income and real capital gains.
   In 1987, when net cash income rose to a record level of $57
billion by USDA estimates, a couple of other things happened.
Interest rates declined, and farm debt, which climbed to a peak of
$192.7 billion in 1983, began to recede as credit tightened and
farmers began paying off at a faster clip.
   More than $50 billion was paid off in the next few years, and
agency economists think the 1988 debt balance may be whittled
further to a range of $128 billion to $138 billion.
   ``Real estate debt of $75 billion to $81 billion in 1988 will be
25 percent lower than in 1984,'' the report said. ``Non-real estate
debt of $53 billion to $57 billion will be nearly 37 percent less.''
   Thus, according to the economists, the return to farmers on
their equity in 1987 averaged 4.4 percent nationally, nearly the
average of 4.9 percent a year in the period of 1959-70.
   Net cash income is expected to decline this year to a range of
$50 billion to $55 billion because of reduced federal supports, as
a three-year drop in production expenses comes to an end, and
because livestock earnings are likely to decline after two years of
growth.
   As a consequence, farm returns on equity are forecast to
decline, perhaps ranging from no gain at all or an increase of 2
percent. But that ``reflects the estimated stable prices for
land,'' the report said.

   Exporters have sold China an additional
350,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
this year.
   In a related development Wednesday, the Agriculture Department
announced that India also is eligible for subsidized wheat.
   The China sales, equal to about 12.8 million bushels, were
handled by four companies: Continental Grain Co., 35,000 tons;
Cargill Inc., 215,000; Artfer Inc., 35,000; and Louis Dreyfus
Corp., 65,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales to China were part of
an authorized 2 million tons of wheat announced April 5 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, and some left over from an
earlier authorization.
   No selling prices or other details were announced, but recent
prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.79 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $36 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4.9 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $28.28 per
ton, or about 77 cents per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has more than 1.9 million tons remaining for use under the
EEP initiative announced April 5, he said.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said India will be
allowed to buy wheat under EEP arrangements. It is the first time
India has been eligible to buy subsidized wheat under the program.

   China's tobacco production in 1988 is forecast
at 2.31 million metric tons, up 19 percent from last year,
according to an Agriculture Department trade report.
   The new figure came from the U.S. agricultural counselor in
Beijing and was reported Wednesday by the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service. Flue-cured tobacco accounts for about 85
percent of China's total output.
   ``To expand domestic supplies for 1988, the government has eased
planting controls and increased prices by 30 percent by changing
grading and price regulations,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Economic Prospects Improving in US But not in Poor Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic prospects have improved slightly over
the past six months in the United States and other industrial
countries, but have dropped sharply in poor countries, according to
estimates made public today by the International Monetary Fund.
   In the United States the fund predicts that production will
increase this year by the same 2.9 percent as it did in 1986 and
1987, with a slower increase of 2.7 percent in 1989. It predicts
declining unemployment from 6.2 percent last year to 6 percent this
year and 5.9 next year.
   Inflation in the industrialized countries is pegged at 3 percent
in 1988. But in the Third World, the report says, prices paid by
consumers will go up by 46.7 percent.
   Total growth in the Third World is put at 3.7 percent.
   The report does not include population figures, but since Third
World birth rates are high, the rise in income for each individual
may be only about half as much. For industrial countries, the new
growth figure is 3 percent.
   ``An important positive development in 1987 was the
strengthening of policy coordination among the major industrial
countries,'' says the fund's new ``World Economic Outlook.''
   ``The U.S. federal budget deficit fell substantially, as did
deficits in other large countries with troublesome fiscal
positions.''
   In the IMF's parlance, a country gets into a ``troublesome
fiscal position'' when its government fails to collect enough taxes
to cover its expenses.
   The fund says the three most economically important Latin
American countries _ Brazil, Mexico and Argentina _ have had
serious setbacks in curbing inflation and there are signs of rising
prices elsewhere. Fund officials doubt if their governments can do
anything effective to stabilize their economies.
   Sluggish growth in the Third World is blamed in part on a
slowdown in India due to drought, and to lower pay and less
investment in Brazil because of rising inflation.
   Growth in China, South Korea and Taiwan, on the other hand, was
called ``particularly buoyant.''
   The predictions are made on the assumption that government
policies and currency exchange rates will not change.
   For the major industrial countries taken as a group the
predictions include these for the years 1990 to 1992: a 2.8 percent
increase in production and a slight increase in the jobless rate to
6.9 percent.

   The assertion by Gov. Michael Dukakis that the
United States reserves the right to ``use nuclear force'' in Europe
is a restatement of a longstanding but sometimes confusing policy
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In the arcane parlance of nuclear weapons, there is a distinct
difference between the phrases ``first strike'' and ``first use.''
   As used by nuclear strategists, the term ``first strike'' refers
to a pre-emptive nuclear attack by one superpower against the
other. U.S. officials have repeatedly said no such strike will be
undertaken by the United States.
   The phrase ``first use'' generally refers to the use of atomic
weapons in Europe, an option the United States has long kept open.
   U.S. policy is that the United States and its NATO allies might
have to resort to nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet attack with
conventional weapons. Supporters of NATO have argued that the
possibility of a U.S. nuclear strike is the main threat feared by
the Soviets.
   The American threat arises from the Soviets' large numerical
advantage in a variety of conventional weapons such as tanks and
artillery.
   Dukakis was attacked on Tuesday by Democratic presidential rival
Albert Gore for his reference to the possible use of nuclear
weapons in Europe. Gore said the United States should not tip its
hand on the use of nuclear force.
   Dukakis responded that he was merely restating longstanding
policy, and the record largely bears that out.
   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, the former commander of NATO,
repeatedly told Congress that because of the Soviets' advantage in
conventional weapons, NATO might have to resort to the first use of
nuclear weapons within ``a matter of days'' to halt a large-scale
Soviet attack.
   The policy has received new attention in the debate over the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pack
eliminating medium-range atomic weapons.
   Critics of the INF pact, such as conservative Republicans, have
argued that eliminating the nuclear threat posed by the U.S.
Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles was one of the main
reasons the Soviets agreed to the pact.
   Even supporters of the treaty have argued that NATO needs to
upgrade its conventional forces to keep the peace in Europe.
   While American doctrine for strategic, or long-range, atomic
weapons is based on a ``no first strike'' plan, U.S. officials have
been intentionally vague about spelling out just what would cause
the launching of the United States strategic arsenal.
   For example, American strategic doctrine is generally thought to
be based on the philosophy that the United States would be able to
ride out a Soviet first strike and then deal a devastating
counterattack. That doctrine of absorbing the first strike arises
from the desire to avoid a nuclear war caused by computer error, no
matter how small that likelihood.

   Here is a chronology of major developments in
the story involving Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula,
and the Bender real estate transaction.
   Aug. 8, 1984: Congress approves a Reagan administration plan to
move some Justice Department workers from the Chester Arthur
Building and to give up 37 percent of its space when the lease
expires in March 1986.
   March 1, 1985: Howard Bender, a Washington real estate
developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the
Chester Arthur Building for $37.5 million, nearly twice the
assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years
earlier.
   June 6, 1985: The administration notifies Congress the Justice
Department intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead
of moving out some employees.
   June 1985: Officials of the Justice Department's Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the major tenant in the building, forward
complaints to the General Services Administration _ the
government's housekeeper _ that the building's air system is
causing illness among workers.
   Fall 1985: Officials at WWDC, a rock-and-roll radio station
owned by the Bender family, offer Attorney General Edwin Meese's
wife, Ursula, a position as a public affairs commentator. She
declines the offer.
   Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner James Kennedy
formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at
Chester Arthur.
   October 1985: The Bender Foundation, a family-owned
philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay
Ursula Meese as a development director of the Multiple Sclerosis
Society, where she has been a volunteer. Howard Bender's wife,
Sondra, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society
board.
   Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. Meese begins a $40,000-a-year job, under the
Bender Foundation's three-year grant.
   July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report ``many offices in
the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates
and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable
aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these
effects.''
   May 14, 1987: The GSA signs a $50 million, 10-year lease for
Justice Department workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building
after the Bender partnership promises to clean the air system. The
rent jumps more than three-fold.
   May 27, 1987: The partnership headed by Howard Bender sells the
Chester Arthur Building for $60.1 million cash _ a $22.7 million
profit over two years _ to an Illinois-based partnership.

   Lady Bird Johnson breezed into a Georgetown
townhouse and realized her black patent leather pumps were still in
the car.
   ``You want to see what old ladies wear?'' the wife of former
President Lyndon B. Johnson asked in her Southern drawl Wednesday
as a coterie of journalists, gossip columnists and society mavens
gathered around.
   The 75-year-old Texan, who once worried about being shy and
insecure as first lady, pulled her coat aside to reveal a pair of
sturdy walking shoes.
   Later, armed with a new coat of lipstick and the proper shoes,
Lady Bird was ready to talk to the women who had covered her years
in the White House and who had recounted in dispatches for their
newspapers what she wore and where she had been.
   Wednesday's story, however, was of her love affair with the
Texas bluebonnet and the Indian paintbrush, the pink evening
primrose and the Mexican hat.
   Nature, she said, ``has been my sustenance, pleasure, my joy.''
   She told of coming back from overseas trips when her husband was
president, inspired to cloak Washington in daffodils, tulips and
azaleas. She spoke of returning to Texas after he left office and
turning a weed and debris-choked riverfront in Austin into a
riverwalk where blooming trees now make the perfect backdrop for
wedding portraits and family pictures.
   And she talked of helping nurture the National Wildflower
Research Center.
   ``I pushed and shoved, encouraged and aided and did everything I
could,'' she said of the center in Austin, where she spends time
away from the LBJ ranch in Stonewall.
   ``A lot of you might think this is a lightweight proposition in
a world of heavyweight questions, but we're going to live, I feel,
and I just think it gives joy to live in a more beautiful world.''
   The nation is now thanking Mrs. Johnson for her efforts to
beautify the countryside from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to Cape Cod,
Mass., and to paint it in native flowers.
   In what is being called ``A Jubilee Celebration'' marking the
year of her 75th birthday, Mrs. Johnson will be given a
Congressional Gold Medal at a White House ceremony, and honored
with receptions, a concert and black-tie dinner April 28-30 in
Washington.
   Dorothy Pierce McSweeny, a native of San Antonio who with her
husband came to Washington to work in the Johnson administration in
the 1960s, said the celebration is timed to coincide with
Washington at its most beautiful _ the time of year when cherry
blossoms float in the air like clouds, and tulips and daffodils
decorate traffic circles and public places.
   ``It best reflects all her contributions to the city,'' Mrs.
McSweeny said at Wednesday's coffee to promote the jubilee
activities. ``It's the time of year that shows it off the most.''
   Mrs. Johnson took advantage of her position at center stage to
promote the center and a book she co-wrote with horticulturalist
Carlton B. Lees. ``Wildflowers Across America'' will be published
in May by Abbeville Press and part of the proceeds will go to the
wildflower center.
   Created in December 1982 with a donation from Mrs. Johnson of 60
acres east of Austin and $125,000, the center is devoted to
researching wildflowers and educating about their use.
   It serves as an information clearinghouse and is experimenting
with wildflowers and native plants to determine how to incorporate
them into landscapes.
   ``Mrs. Johnson says it's a lightweight proposition,'' said Bob
Mann, vice president of communications for the American Trucking
Association, who is coordinating publicity on the jubilee
celebration. ``Thank God someone in this troubled world is thinking
about beauty.''

<HEAD>Last Minute Filers Can Save Time With Short Form</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you are among millions of taxpayers waiting
until the last minute to file federal returns, you might save time
and expedite any refund by avoiding the long Form 1040.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, found during
a check of one of the 10 IRS processing centers that 14.1 percent
of filers had used 1040 when they could have filed the simpler
1040A or the one-page 1040EZ.
   Many of those probably were taxpayers who in the past itemized
deductions and thus had to file the long form, and stuck with it
this year even though repeal or reduction of several deductions
made it no longer profitable to itemize.
   The shorter forms are less complicated to fill out and present
fewer opportunities for errors. The IRS requires less time to
process them.
   But the shorter forms are not for everyone. If your itemized
deductions total more than your standard deduction, you'll save
money by itemizing, which requires the long form. And you must file
the long form if taxable income is $50,000 or more.
   Midnight Friday is the deadline for most individuals to file
their returns _ the first that reflect the far-reaching tax-law
revision enacted in 1986. So far, despite confusion about the law
and new forms, taxpayers and the IRS seem to be holding their own.
   ``This has been a very good filing season to date,'' Gibbs said.
``But it has been challenging ... because of the number of changes
made in the 1986 act.''
   Through April 8, the IRS had received 64.5 million returns,
compared with 65.7 million before the last week of the 1987 filing
season. The agency has processed 52.7 million this year, down
slightly from 52.8 million at this time last year.
   Refunds have been certified for 78 percent _ 41 million _ of the
returns that have been processed, compared with 79 percent at this
time last year. Refunds are averaging $830, up from $815.
   New restrictions on itemized deductions and higher standard
deductions have significantly reduced the number of couples and
individuals who are itemizing, Gibbs said.
   The one dark spot on this tax season, IRS and GAO agree, is that
taxpayers still find it difficult to get the correct answer when
they telephone tax questions to the IRS. GAO said IRS provided the
right answer to only 62 percent of the 1,523 test calls made by
GAO. A broader IRS survey, 15,000 calls, produced the correct
response to 72.1 percent of the questions.
   In each survey, the accuracy rate was up slightly from a
February check.
   ``You get better odds in Las Vegas,'' grumbled Rep. J.J. Pickle,
chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.
   ``We must and will improve our accuracy rate for our
customers,'' Gibbs promised. He mentioned plans to make telephone
``assistors'' full-time, rather than seasonal, employees; to raise
their pay and to give each immediate access to computerized
information necessary to answer questions.
   Despite all the confusion about new laws and complicated forms,
the subcommittee was told, taxpayers are having fewer problems than
anticipated:
   _The IRS has received 15.7 million telephone calls for
information this year, up 12.6 percent from last year but 7.8
percent fewer than expected.
   _Errors are showing up on 20.7 percent of returns, about 1.4
percentage points above last year. ``The amount of the increase has
been less than expected,'' said GAO Deputy Director Johnny F. Finch.
   _About 42 percent of the returns filed so far have been prepared
by professionals, up from 40 percent last year but less than in
1986. Some experts had predicted most taxpayers would have to turn
to professionals because of the new law.
   Finch said 48 percent of 892 taxpayers surveyed in four states
and the District of Columbia had more trouble filling out this
year's returns than last year's. Another 30 percent found little
difference, and 12 percent said this year's were easier. Ten
percent were not sure.

<HEAD>Nader Asks Congress to Keep Banks Out Of Securities Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader wants Congress
to reject efforts to restructure the nation's financial system to
allow banks and securities firms broad latitude to affiliate for
the first time since 1933.
   Nader, representing the Center for Study of Responsive Law, told
the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee Wednesday
that Congress should not repeal the provisions of the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act which prohibit banks and bank holding companies
from underwriting and dealing in corporate securities.
   Specifically, Nader said banking organizations should continue
to be barred from dealing in the following securities activities:
   _Underwriting or dealing in corporate debt or equity securities.
   _Sponsorship or investment management of mutual funds comprised
of corporate debt or equity securities.
   _Underwriting securities collateralized by their own loans.
   Nader told the subcommittee that commerical bank underwriting
and dealing in corporate securities ``involves serious conflicts of
interest that can injure public investors, undermine the integrity
of capital markets and are not readily controlled by any
realistically available set of safeguards.''
   Before Nader testified, David S. Ruder, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, told the subcommittee the
regulatory agency endorses Senate-passed legislation to permit
banks to enter the securities business ``so long as adequate
safeguards are established to address investor protection
concerns.''
   Ruder said the SEC believes the Senate legislation, sponsored by
William Proxmire, D-Wisc., has adequate safeguards for the repeal
of Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from the securities
business in the aftermath of the 1929 financial crash.
   ``The commission supports modification or repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act as long as the investor protection concerns
arising from the entry of banks into securities activities are
simultaneously addressed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hollywood In Charge Of Look, Sound, Feel of Democratic National
Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood will add its touch to the
ready-made theater of the Democratic National Convention this
summer, but producers say the professional flourishes will be
tasteful and relevant.
   The Democratic National Convention Committee hired the
entertainment production company of Smith-Hemion to produce and
stage the Atlanta convention _ believed to be the first time the
Democrats have brought in theatrical producers to stage their
convention.
   Smith-Hemion has a history of staging ``events'' and has earned
20 Emmy awards over the years for its television extravaganzas,
said partner Gary Smith.
   Festivities like the Liberty Weekend celebration in Washington,
D.C., television's ``We the People 200'' featuring Walter Cronkite,
and Disneyland's 25th anniversary party were produced by the
company.
   Smith-Hemion will work with the media, create ``the look'' of
the arena, design the podium, oversee the sound and use big screens
to provide visual elements that have been pre-taped in support of
the speeches, Smith explained.
   ``Even in a convention there is room for relevant entertainment
_ tasteful and relevant,'' he said, adding that in his opinion a
convention should be more than a series of speeches.
   The agenda of the convention is up to the Democrats, he
emphasized, but the producers will supply ``things that are
emotionally effective or emotionally motivated and good information
that is visually enhanced.''
   Smith said it was too early to identify entertainers or special
effects to be used during the convention. Those things will be part
of the it, he said, ``but the Democrats have not gone into show
business. The most important priority is the need to maintain their
agenda.''
   Smith-Hemion's team of about 100 people started working six
weeks ago and will continue working until the convention is staged
July 18-21 in The Omni.
   ``This is a news event that TVs are picking up. Opening ceremony
on Liberty Weekend was a bit created. This convention is an
official American event. We would do it whether it was on
television or not,'' Smith said.
   He said the convention is more meaningful to him because ``if I
have ever been affiliated with any party, it would be Democratic.
But I have always voted for the person, not the party.''
   In addition to the staging and production work, Smith-Hemion
will provide closed circuit, gavel-to-gavel coverage that will be
available by satellite to every television station in the country,
he said.
   The art director for the convention is Rene Lagler, who worked
on both Liberty Weekend and the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. ``He
is designing the look of the podium and how the arena will look
from a scenic standpoint,'' Smith said.
   How will Smith-Hemion rate the success of its work?
   ``I don't think ratings will enter into it whatsoever,'' he said
of the television ratings which usually tell networks whether they
have scored a commercial success.
   Emmy nominations and awards are a measure of creative success,
but that won't be a good gauge in this case either, he said.
   It will come down to whether ``the DNC says we did a good job,''
said Smith, who refused to identify a favorite candidate.
   If the Democratic nominee wins the presidential race in
November, ``that would make us feel pretty good. Obviously that is
the ultimate goal _ to win the election come November,'' he said.

   The hijacking of a Kuwaiti jet by Shiite
Moslems and the killing of two Kuwaiti hostages have embarrassed
Arab leaders who want world attention to remain focused on the Arab
uprising in Israel.
   Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed, foreign minister of Kuwait, asked by
reporters about the hijackers, said ``regrettably we have to
concede they are Arabs.''
   The 4-month-old Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied
territory has brought an unusual degree of unity among Arabs,
radical and moderate, supporting Arabs youths defying Israeli armed
forces with stones and bottles.
   Pictures of the two Kuwaiti bodies thrown out of the jumbo jet
in Cyprus on Saturday and Monday and wired to newspapers and
television stations around the world, shook that unity. ``This
incident has spoiled the image of the Arabs in the world,'' said
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Mubarak said Israeli attempts to put down the uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 140 Palestinians
have been killed since Dec. 8, were ``our prime preoccupation.''
   Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
issued a message to the hijackers of the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747
that ``their action is not only hurting the Kuwaitis but the Arab
and Islamic nation.''
   Arafat said the hijacking _ which has taken the plane and
hostages from Mashhad, Iran, to Larnaca, Cyprus, to Algiers,
Algeria, in nine days _ took away the glare of world publicity from
the Palestinian revolt.
   ``This action diverts world attention from the uprising in the
West Bank and Gaza, and from the brutal and oppressive measures of
the Israeli occupying authorities,'' Foreign Minister Taher Masri
of Jordan told The Associated Press in Amman on Wednesday. Israel
captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Marwan Dudin, Jordanian minister of occupied territories, said
the hijack ``contributed to harming the image of Arabs worldwide.''
   Dudin said most Europeans link Islam and Arabs and connect any
Moslem group with the fundamentalist revolution in Iran of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Masri said the hijack should not affect the Arab image. ``After
all we are the victims'' he said. Furthermore, he said: ``It is
clear they (the hijackers) are backed by the Iranian regime.''
   Although the current hijack is complicated by an alleged role
played by Iran _ which is Persian, not Arab _ it is not the first
time Arabs have hurt the image of their cause by violent disunity.
   Infighting including assasinations have plagued the PLO.
   For 13 years the world has been seeing gory scenes of Arab
killing Arab in the complicated carnage of the Lebanese civil war.
In the summer of 1977, border clashes brought Egypt and Libya to
the brink of war.

   Welsh actor Timothy Dalton, who
earned agent 007's license to kill in the James Bond film ``The
Living Daylights,'' has had his license renewed for the next Bond
movie, ``License Revoked.''
   Dalton, trained as a Shakespearean actor, performed many of his
own stunts in ``The Living Daylights,'' in which Bond battles a
nefarious international arms smuggler while courting femme fatale
Maryam D'Abo.
   Dalton's performance proved he was the right man to pick up the
keys to the Aston Martin and carry on in the tradition of Sean
Connery and Roger Moore, who starred in previous Bond thrillers,
said Amy Kimmelman, a United Artists spokeswoman.
   Filming for ``License Revoked'' will begin in mid-July in Mexico
City, with other locations to be selected later, Ms. Kimmelman said.

<HEAD>One In Five Train Crews In Accidents Had Positive Drug, Alcohol
Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new General Accounting Office report shows
that drug and alcohol abuse by railroad crew members has become ``a
runaway train,'' a senator says.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., offered that characterization on
Wednesday after the report was released by GAO, the investigative
arm of Congress. It reported that one in five crews involved in
train accidents during 1987 had at least one member test positive
for drugs or alcohol.
   The finding came during a review of the Federal Railroad
Administration's policy of requiring railroad workers in major
accidents to submit to drug and alcohol tests.
   On Feb. 11, the testing was struck down as unconstitutional by
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. But the
program remains in place while the Reagan administration appeals.
   ``Substance abuse on the rails is fast becoming a runaway
train,'' said Heinz, who requested the GAO study.
   Of 179 accidents during 1987, GAO found at least one positive
drug or alcohol finding in 37, or about 20 percent. However, the
report did not identify in how many of those cases the drugs or
alcohol actually figured in the accident.
   In all, 42, or 5.5 percent, of 770 rail workers sampled last
year following accidents tested positive for alcohol or illicit
drugs, said the FRA, which released its own figures this week in
answer to a reporter's query.
   GAO also reported that the amount of time needed to report drug
and alcohol test results has substantially improved.
   In April 1987, it took an average of 16.2 working days to report
initial screening test results for accidents where all crew members
tested negative. By October, the reporting time had been reduced to
4.8 working days, GAO said. It takes longer when positive results
are found, because they must be confirmed.
   Heinz had complained that long lags were hampering
investigations and unfairly placing suspicion on innocent crew
members.
   FRA ended an agreement with a Federal Aviation Administration
laboratory in Oklahoma City in March 1987 because it said it
discovered discrepancies in the results, according to GAO. In
April, FRA contracted with a toxicology center at the University of
Utah for the tests.

   Elderly people living alone are more likely to
maintain their independence and live longer if they visit with
friends and neighbors and attend church or other group events, a
government study reports.
   And people over age 70 who live alone are more likely to survive
over a two-year period than those who live with someone, the
National Center for Health Statistics found in the study made
public Wednesday.
   Both living alone and engaging in various activities were
indications of better health. The less active elderly were more
likely to die or become institutionalized over time.
   There is a noticeable difference for those people who have
contact with friends ands neighbors, who go to church or synagogue
or attend sports events, reported Dr. Mary Grace Kovar, author of
the study.
   Her findings in ``Aging in the Eighties, People Living Alone _
Two Years Later'' are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with
people who were 70 and older in 1984.
   Of those living alone who reported regular meetings with friends
and neighbors in 1984, 92.5 percent were still alive two years
later and 89.3 percent were still living on their own.
   On the other hand, of those who had no such contact, 86.6
percent survived two years and 81.5 percent still lived alone.
   For regular churchgoers in 1984, 94.9 percent survived two years
and 91.9 percent were still alone. Of those who didn't attend
church or synagogue, 86.2 percent survived and 81.9 percent lived
on their own.
   But regular contact with family did not seem a significant
factor in longer life and more independence. Perhaps those
reporting extra family contacts needed the help because they were
not well, Kovar speculated.
   ``Children may have come around more frequently ... just to make
sure'' the older folks were all right, she said.
   ``The most important thing (found in the study) is the
stability,'' Kovar said in a telephone interview.
   ``Most of these people, two years later, are still living in the
community. Those who were living alone are still alone, and those
with someone else are still with someone else,'' she said.
   ``As you would expect, because these people are 72 or older,
death rates are high. But relatively few of them are in nursing
homes,'' she noted.
   Of nearly 6.4 million elderly people living alone in 1984, 89.8
percent were still alive two years later, she found.
   By comparison, 89.0 percent of those living with a spouse
survived two years and 84.3 percent who had been living with
someone else were still alive.
   Of those who had been on their own in 1984, Kovar found that by
1986, 77.8 percent were still living by themselves. Some 7.4
percent of them had moved in with someone else _ most often family
_ and 4.6 percent were in an institution.
   ``It certainly appears that for some of them life is better''
two years later, she added. ``Some have remarried _ not many but
some _ and when we asked those who had moved why ... we got''
answers ranging from health to being nearer to children to spending
the summer in Maine and winter in Florida. One, she said, even
cited lower golf fees for moving.
   A major factor in continued independence is likely that those
living alone were more healthy at the start of the study, she
concluded in the report.
   Health was also a factor in the stability of those living alone,
she found.
   For example, people who needed help with basic daily activities
such as bathing, dressing, eating or using the toilet, were much
more likely to have died over the two year span.
   While only about 10 percent of all those living alone died in
the two year period, 25 percent of those who had needed help in
basic daily activities died and 16 percent were in nursing homes
after two years.
   ``It is very difficult ... to disentangle'' all the factors
affecting these people, she said. Another follow-up series of
interviews is scheduled for this summer, to compare the same group
of elderly in 1988.
   Overall, she found that nursing homes appear to be a last resort
for the elderly.
   These is evidence of a progression, she reported, ``people live
alone, then with other people if others are available, then they
may become nursing home residents.''

<HEAD>FmHA Plans to Erase $8.8 Billion in Farm Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some $8.8 billion in lingering debt owed by
agricultural producers will be wiped from the books of the Farmers
Home Administration under a measure approved by lawmakers last
year, the agency's administrator says.
   ``It is true that we are probably writing off upwards of $8
billion to $9 billion over the next couple of years and the
agricultural credit act is responsible for a substantial portion of
that,'' FmHA Administrator Vance Clark told a Senate Appropriations
panel Wednesday.
   Under provisions of the Farm Credit Act approved last year, FmHA
will ``write down,'' or defer payments, on $2.1 billion in debt
owed by farmers who will be restored to profitability as a result,
the agency said.
   Eventually, it said, the government may still be able to recover
some of that money.
   But it said would simply write off $6.7 billion in
non-performing loans to farmers who even with such help will not be
able to turn a profit.
   Last year's legislation required the government to take such
actions if they would be less expensive for the taxpayers than
foreclosure.
   Clark's disclosure followed an unconfirmed report last month
that the government most likely would write off $7 billion in FmHA
loans.
   The disclosure came in response to a question from Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who had seen the earlier published report and was
concerned about it.
   Grassley was critical of Clark, however, for saying that it was
the Farm Credit Act that was costing the money.
   He said that in every case foreclosure would have been more
expensive and thus the taxpayers were not losing anything that they
would not have lost anyway.
   ``They're including costs that would have been there even if
Congress had not passed the bill,'' Grassley said.
   He called the foreclosure-expense test ``a very objective,
bottom line decision that really means what Congress passed isn't
costing the federal government anything.''

   An electric shock device intended to help keep
disturbed people from injuring themselves is being labeled medieval
torture by opponents while supporters call it a miracle.
   ``This thing works,'' said retired Marine Col. Bernard McShane,
the father of severely retarded 37-year-old twins. ``There is a
case ... for this device.''
   McShane jumped up to praise the so-called self-injurious
behavior inhibiting system (SIBIS) Wednesday at a news conference
organized by 13 national groups seeking to stop its sale to doctors
and psychologists.
   He interrupted the presentation to say his daughters' lives had
been transformed from the first hour they started wearing the
self-activating device, which administers an electric shock when a
person inflicts a blow on himself.
   ``They've stopped tearing their clothes off. They've stopped
hitting themselves,'' McShane said of his daughters, who are living
in an Italian institution run by nuns.
   ``They now sit and have their dinner with their two roommates.
They can participate. ... I fully intend to let them wear them for
the rest of their lives,'' he said.
   An estimated 50,000 severely retarded or autistic people suffer
from the mysterious syndrome in which they bang their heads against
the floor or wall or beat their heads and faces with their fists.
Drugs and physical restraints are often used to try to stop the
self-inflicted blows when other approaches fail.
   SIBIS was reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration and
registered last June for commercial sale and distribution. It
consists of lightweight headgear and an arm or leg band, and
delivers a shock an opponent described as painful and a supporter
compared to a ``one-tenth of a second pinprick.''
   The association for Retarded Citizens, the Mental Health Law
Project and the Autism Society of America were among the groups
denouncing SIBIS as unconstitutional and punitive.
   Frank Laski, a lawyer from the Public Interest Law Center of
Philadelphia, said the device violates ``the most fundamental
concepts of personal dignity, personal autonomy and due process.''
He said it was ``neither humane nor effective.''
   ``Let us not return to the Dark Ages,'' said Janet Salzano,
mother of a 30-year-old autistic son. ``It is my philosophy that
the disabled have the same rights as everyone else in America.''
   Several speakers said other approaches are effective in treating
the problem and have a longer-lasting impact than SIBIS. They said
they are concerned that the FDA approved the device without
published evidence that it works and without standards for its use.
   Thomas Linscheid, a professor of pediatrics and psychology at
Ohio State University who observed the news conference, said he is
compiling data ``that prove very definitively that this has been a
very effective procedure.''
   He said psychologists who support SIBIS do not necessarily
oppose positive behavior modification techniques and in fact the
two can complement each other. ``If I can stop this person from
hitting himself 3,000 times in a six-hour school day, I can do more
positive reinforcement,'' he said. ``It gives me a window of
opportunity.''
   Linscheid also said desperate parents should not be deprived of
anything that seems to work. He cited a South Carolina teen-ager
who was in restraints for 10 years but has gained 60 pounds, feeds
himself and is toilet trained since starting with SIBIS. ``It's
pretty hard to say to parents, `take that away,''' he said.
   Asked about potential misuse of the device, Linscheid said the
disabled are protected by many advocacy groups and added, ``We
can't say that because there's a chance for abuse, we can't use it
at all.''

<HEAD>Former Attorney General Represents Raid Victims in Suit Against US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark is
representing the survivors of 15 Libyans killed during the U.S.
bombing raid of Libya two years ago in a civil suit for damages
against the Reagan administration.
   Clark, who has been criticized in the past for dealing with
nations hostile to the United States, filed the lawsuit Wednesday
to collect unspecified damages for the deaths, property damage and
injuries to 40 other Libyans.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, charged that the April
14, 1986 bombing violated ``settled principles of international
law'' in the United Nations Charter and numerous treaties and
declarations.
   It charged the Reagan administration purposely hid the real
purpose of the bombing _ which the suit said was to kill Libyan
leader Moammar Ghadafi and to ``terrorize Libyans by inflicting
injury upon the civilian population in order to undermine support''
for their leader.
   President Reagan said the raid was in retaliation for the
anti-American attacks authorized by Ghadafi, including the bombing
of a West Berlin discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen that
killed two and injured 150 others.
   The lawsuit charged that top governent officials, including
President Reagan, ``are guilty of conduct constituting clear
violations of settled principles of international law prohibiting
the use of force by a state against the territorial integrity of
political independence of another state.''
   Among the victims of the bombing raid was a 3-month-old girl who
died when hit by shrapnel while asleep in her home in Benghazi. The
child's 38-year-old father was also killed by shrapnel, according
to the complaint.
   The suit, filed under the Alien Tort Statute and the Federal
Tort Claims Act, said claims for compensation by the victims or
their survivors were rejected last October by the Air Force.
   The suit named Reagan individually and in his capacity as
commander in chief of U.S. armed forces. British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher was sued for approving the use of U.S. military
bases in Britain to launch the attacks.
   Also sued were former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and
top military officials, including Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and retired Gen. Bernard W.
Rogers, former supreme allied commender in Europe.
   The estate of the late CIA Director William J. Casey was also
named as a defendant in the case, which was assigned to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   Clark, who served as attorney general under President Johnson,
has been criticized over several years for dealing with foreign
governments whose interests conflict with this country.
   In 1980 he attended a ``Crimes of America'' conference in Iran
while American hostages were being held in Tehran. He also was
criticized in 1972 for traveling to Hanoi to investigate the
effects of U.S. bombing during the Vietnam War.

   The Army's new tank plating which uses
depleted uranium may not curb the large Soviet advantage in the
race to develop the best armor and the deadliest way of attacking
those defenses, according to an Army armor specialist.
   ``It's too early to tell how effective it is,'' retired Army
Gen. Donn Starry told reporters.
   Starry specialized in armor systems before he retired last year
as commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, where he
was responsible for helping develop tank warfare doctrine.
   The new U.S. armor was unveiled last month by Army officials,
who said it would be ``a significant enhancement'' of U.S.
capabilities for the M-1A1 Abrams, the main U.S. battle tank. A
statement by the service said the new armor would ``allow the
Abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s.''
   Speaking to a Senate Armed Services subcommittee Wednesday,
Starry offered an extremely negative assessment of the U.S.-Soviet
balance in armor and anti-armor weapons.
   None of the top U.S. anti-tank weapons is likely to work against
front-line Soviet tanks because the Soviets have developed
innovative armor, Starry told the conventional forces subcommittee.
   The Soviets have a roughly 3-1 advantage in tanks stationed in
western Europe, but Pentagon officials have argued that many of the
Soviet weapons are far older and thus likely to be less effective
than Western tanks.
   In addition, the Army and other NATO nations have stockpiled
thousands of anti-tank missiles, such as the Dragon, several types
of TOWs and the Hellfire.
   None of them would work, Starry said, because the Soviets have
developed reactive armor that uses both a ceramic cover and a
series of ``applique boxes.'' The latter, developed by the Israelis
a decade ago, are specially designed boxes containing explosives
which blow up when hit by an incoming explosive. The explosion of
the box dissipates and dilutes the force of the incoming weapon.
   ``The unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top of
built-in glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quite
likely defeat the warheads of all deployed'' weapons used by
Western forces, he said.
   Starry's views took some senators by surprise.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, asked Starry, ``Are you including
Hellfire?'' His reference was to the missile carried by the Apache,
the Army's newest attack helicopter and a weapon that was designed
specifically to defeat Soviet tanks.
   ``Yes,'' said Starry.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, asked,
``Are you saying that if we went to war, our bullets and missiles
would bounce off Soviet tanks?''
   ``That's correct,'' said Starry.
   In 1985, Starry took part in a study by the Pentagon's Defense
Science Board, which concluded that the Soviets had an advantage
over the United States in armor and in attacking armor. The study
described the situation as a matter of ``national urgency.''
   The situation is worse now, he said. ``Today, it is my judgment
that we have crossed the threshold; the situation is now a matter
of considerable national urgency.''
   Army officials told the subcommittee Wednesday they agreed with
Starry's assessment of the DSB report in 1985 and the current
situation.
   ``The Army agreed with the DSB conclusions in 1985 and still
agrees with the conclusion that we are behind the Soviets. We need
to regain the lead and maintain that advantage,'' said Lt. Gen.
Donald S. Pihl, deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army for
research and development.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most black and Jewish voters have coalesced
around the two chief competitors in New York's Democratic
presidential primary but other potentially large voting blocs
remain fragmented, political analysts say.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s attempt to outflank Gov. Michael Dukakis
for the Jewish vote appears destined to fall short, an expert in
Jewish opinion said Wednesday. And Jesse Jackson's strength remains
greatest with blacks, said other experts.
   The analysts said other major groups _ such as union members,
homosexuals and Roman Catholics _ do not seem to be drawn to any of
the candidates by a single overriding issue in next Tuesday's vote.
   What then may come into play for these Democratic voters is the
pragmatic issue of which candidate is most likely to win the
presidency, said Meyer S. Frucher, a leading political strategist.
   A key battle has been for Jews, up to a quarter of the
Democratic vote. Gore has sought their support by placing himself
to Dukakis' right on Middle East policy, flatly opposing formation
of a Palestinian state.
   The hard line may help Gore in Brooklyn, where 25 percent of the
400,000 Jews are in the Orthodox sect, said Steven M. Cohen, a
sociology professor at Queens College who has polled Jewish
attitudes for a decade.
   But the effort likely will fail overall, Cohen said, because
Dukakis and Gore are close enough on Middle East policy for either
to be acceptable to the majority of Jews, and Dukakis appeals to
them on other grounds.
   ``Dukakis is seen as friendly because he's a Northeast liberal
ethnic,'' Cohen said. ``He's our type of guy.''
   Jackson has received black backing in the 90-percent range in
other states, and blacks, like Jews, account for up to a quarter of
the Democratic vote in New York. He also may count on broad support
from Hispanics, said Victor Alicea, a Hispanic leader. But in 1984,
Hispanics made up just 4 percent of the state primary vote.
   Organized labor is divided, said Theodore W. Kheel, a longtime
labor mediator in the city. The Central Labor Council and the State
Federation of Labor are neutral, he said, while local leaders ``are
all over the lot.''
   In the absence of a defining issue, Catholics also do not
constitute a strong voting block, and ``I don't think there's going
to be a Catholic groundswell for any Democratic candidate,'' said
Ed Wilkinson, editor of The Tablet, the newspaper of the
Archdiocese of Brooklyn and Queens.
   Nonetheless, said pollster Lee Miringoff of the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion, ``I think the white ethnic vote is
going to Dukakis at this point.''
   Dukakis, a Greek-American, also expects enthusiastic support
from the Greek community, which has about 65,000 adult U.S.
citizens in the city.
   Homosexuals are in far more of a quandary. Many activists reject
Dukakis because of his opposition to homosexual couples as foster
parents, said Thomas B. Stoddard, director of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund. But many fear Jackson or Gore would
lose to the Republican.
   The result is that some voters will go for Jackson, who is
viewed overall as better on homosexual issues, said Stoddard. Those
less concerned about the foster parent issues will back Dukakis. A
few will vote for Gore, whose standing is ``uncertain'' on
homosexual issues other than AIDS.
   ``Some,' Stoddard added, ``will simply stay home.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Ask Unions to Accept End to Trade Bill's Plant-Closings
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders are asking unions to go
along with dropping mandatory notice of plant closings from the
sweeping congressional trade bill because of threats of a
presidential veto.
   But union representatives refused to relent Wednesday in a
three-hour meeting with the leaders behind closed doors, according
to sources who asked not to be identified by name.
   ``We're still searching,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
told reporters following the session in the office of Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Wright declined to go into
detail.
   Warnings that the plant-closings measure could prompt President
Reagan to use his veto power and thus scuttle the entire 1,000-page
trade bill failed to move representatives of the United Auto
Workers and several other labor groups, according to the sources.
   Under the provision in question, companies with at least 100
employees would be required to provide 60 days notice of plant
closings and layoffs involving at least one-third of their work
force.
   Layoffs involving 500 workers or more would have to be preceded
by notice even if less than one-third of the work force is involved.
   Labor representatives called on the leaders to push forward with
the plant-closings provision in defiance of repeated veto threats
from members of President Reagan's Cabinet. Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III issued the latest warning Tuesday.
   Labor representatives left the session without commenting to
reporters, as did a number of congressional participants.
   Besides Byrd and Wright, those on hand were House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The disputed measure, part of the Senate version of the trade
bill but not that passed by the House, has aroused passionate
opposition among several business groups. They say it could be the
first step toward taking control of companies away from management.
   Supporters say something must be done to end circumstances in
which factory workers with families arrive at work to find that the
plant is closed permanently and their job has vanished.
   At the heart of the trade bill are provisions that would
transfer to the U.S. trade representative authority to retaliate
against international violations by the nation's trading partners
and other ``unjustifiable'' practices. The president currently has
that authority.
   Main provisions also would streamline machinery for imposing
import curbs to aid threatened U.S. industries.
   The bill contains scores of other provisions ranging from repeal
of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to tighter monitoring
of lamb imports.
   In recent days, a chief concern of lawmakers has been finding a
formula that would guarantee that President Reagan would sign the
bill.
   A hint that leaders were leaning toward dropping the provision
came earlier Wednesday when Wright told reporters it would still
represent ``a good bill'' if shorn of the plant-closings feature.
He did say it would be ``a better bill with that provision''
included.
   Republicans, who furnished much of the opposition to the
plant-closings provision, were not party to the talks with labor
representatives.
   But dropping the provision could prove a touchy matter.
Sponsors, including Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Rep.
Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., pressed ahead and succeeded in
inserting the feature in the bill amid a hailstorm of
administration veto threats.
   Kennedy, the only plant-closings sponsor in the afternoon
session, was asked during a brief break whether he was making any
progress in saving the measure. He said merely: ``We'll see.''
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in a study last year, estimated
that two out of every three workers are not told they are losing
their job until the day they are taken off the payroll.
   The National Academy of Sciences said in a report last June that
the voluntary notices advocated by the administration and business
do not now provide workers with the ``minimum two or three months
necessary to adjust successfully to job loss.''

<HEAD>Administration Waited Four Years To Act On Law Protecting Dolphins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are criticizing the Reagan
administration for taking four years to implement a law aimed at
reducing the number of dolphins that drown when they are snared by
huge tuna nets in the eastern Pacific.
   ``Wholly inadequate,'' says John Kerry, D-Mass.
   ``An embarrassment,'' adds John Breaux, D-La., one of the
authors of the 1984 law passed by Congress in an effort to put
teeth into the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.
   The 1984 statute requires the National Marine Fisheries Service
to bar importation of tuna caught by a foreign nation if its tuna
boats fail to take steps to protect dolphins, as the U.S. tuna
industry is required to do.
   ``The foreign tuna fleet in the eastern tropical Pacific is
killing over 100,000 dolphins a year and our government agencies
have done little to implement the 1984 changes designed to address
the problem,'' Kerry said Wednesday at a Commerce Committee hearing.
   Dolphin kills began increasing in the late 1950s, when tuna
fishermen switched from baited hooks to gigantic seines. For
reasons unclear to biologists, the popular yellowfin tuna
congregate beneath groups of surface-swimming dolphin, which then
serve to mark the tuna schools to fishing boats.
   Conservationists estimate that some 6 million of the mammals
have drowned over the years after being trapped in tuna nets.
   ``We face a serious situation in the tropical Pacific,''
testified William Fox, a member of the Marine Mammal Commission. He
said preliminary findings from a dolphin census show some stocks
are smaller than thought and others are declining.
   Because of improved netting techniques, the number of Dolphin
kills by U.S. tuna boats has dropped from 368,000 in 1972 to 13,992
last year, the hearing was told. Foreign kills reportedly fell from
423,678 in 1972 to an estimated maximum of 82,000, compared to
108,767 in 1986 and 37,505 in 1985.
   Only recently did the fisheries service publish regulations to
carry out the 1984 law. They would give foreign tuna fleets until
1991 to match the performance of the U.S. fleet, which is allowed
to kill up to 20,500 dolphins a year.
   ``Why are we waiting until 1991?'' asked Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif. ``I think we should pursue why it will take until 1991 to
impose these import restrictions.''
   Kerry said, ``It bothers me enormously we've allowed this
situation to drag on. It's really sad. I don't know what you people
are doing sitting down there.''
   James Douglas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's acting assistant administrator for fisheries,
said, ``we're not particularly proud of the amount of time it took
to do these regulations.''
   He said regulators walked a tightrope, wanting to reduce foreign
fleet dolphin kills without causing other nations to give up the
U.S. market and continue to fish for tuna without adopting
techniques to save dolphins.
   David Burney of the U.S. Tuna Foundation, an industry group,
said foreign tuna fleets should adopt U.S. methods. ``There is no
excuse for them not having done that,'' he said. ``It should have
been done three years ago.''

   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. says Michael
Dukakis lacks foreign policy experience and ``simply doesn't know
what he's talking about'' when it comes to using nuclear weapons
and American military power.
   Trying to catch up with Dukakis and Jesse Jackson before
Tuesday's important New York primary, Gore maintained Wednesday
that Dukakis had made ``a major blunder'' by discussing in a
newspaper interview when he would use nuclear weapons against the
Soviet Union.
   He stood by his criticism in the face of a strong denial by
Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor said he had merely reflected
existing American and NATO policy in holding open the option of a
nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of Western Europe
with conventional forces.
   The Tennesse senator offered broader criticism as well, faulting
Dukakis for advocating a ban on flight testing of ballistic
missiles and for what he said were remarks supporting the
commitment of American troops in the event of Communist invaders in
West Germany or South Korea.
   ``I think in a lot of these matters he simply doesn't know what
he's talking about, and he needs an opportunity to clarify his
remarks and I want to give him an opportuhity to do so,'' Gore said
to reporters.
   A long-distance exchange between the two candidates was touched
off by an interview with Dukakis published Wednesday in the Daily
News of New York. Gore characterized Dukakis' remarks as amounting
to saying ``he would launch a nuclear first strike against the
Soviet Union if they invaded Europe with conventional forces.''
   Dukakis, in Boston, insisted Gore was distorting his comments.
Dukakis said his position was that he would consider the use of
nuclear forces as an option in the event of a successful Soviet
invasion of Europe. ``That has been the policy of our government,''
Dukakis said. ``It is the policy of the NATO alliance.''
   In a transcript provided by the newspaper, Dukakis was asked if
he could conceive of a scenario in which he would use nuclear
weapons first, ``as a strategic weapon.'' His response began,
``Yes, yes. I would hope I wouldn't have to.'' He said he was for
``a policy of no early first use. But our present strategy in
Europe assumes that if the Soviets were to invade and conventional
forces couldn't stop them that we'd reserve the right to use
nuclear force.''
   James Steinberg, the defense and foreign policy adviser to
Dukakis, said Dukakis started answering the question thinking he
was being asked about tactical nuclear weapons. The reference to
``strategic'' was made after Dukakis had started speaking,
Steinberg said.
   Steinberg said he assumed Dukakis would have given a different
answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear
weapons.
   Gore campaign manager Fred Martin insisted Gore had not
distorted Dukakis' words. Both Gore and Martin said Dukakis had
erred in getting into a discussion of nuclear first use.
   ``I think it is most unwise for a president of the United States
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces
and trigger destruction of human civilization,'' Gore said. ``To
specify in advance when we would make that fateful step is most
unwise and irresponsible.''
   Appearing later before Westchester County Democrats in Rye
Brook, N.Y., Gore stressed that Dukakis had been asked about
``strategic'' nuclear weapons.
   ``NATO has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,''
Gore said. ``The president of the United States has traditionally
refused to respond to that hypothetical.''
   Gore's criticism and the ensuing flap overshadowed an event
Wednesday when Gore went to the Love Canal toxic waste site at
Niagra Falls to underscore his commitment to environmental
protection and blast the Reagan administration.
   As a congressman, Gore chaired congressional hearings that
looked into the dumping of toxic wastes at the site.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout Won't End Effect Of `Dirty War' On Soviet Life</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mikhail Gorbachev called it the nation's
``bleeding wound.''
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the human rights activist and Nobel Peace
laureate, branded it ``one of the great tragedies of our times.''
   Costly in lives, money and Soviet prestige, the Kremlin's
military intervention in Afghanistan has become a national trauma.
   With the stroke of a pen in Geneva today, the Soviet Union
committed itself to withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, but
that can't remove all the shadows cast over Soviet diplomacy and
peoples' lives.
   By agreeing to pull out forces sent into Afghanistan beginning
Dec. 27, 1979, to replace one pro-Marxist regime with another, the
Soviets _ like the Americans in Vietnam _ have acknowledged their
inability to keep bearing the human and diplomatic costs of an
anti-guerrilla war in a foreign land.
   But while the Red Army may end its engagement, few expect the
fighting to cease outright. And there are indications the Soviets
may continue shipping weapons to their former comrades in arms
after their estimated 115,000 troops return home.
   The Red Army has been on the ground in Afghanistan for more than
eight years, more than twice as long as it took the Soviets in
World War II to drive the invading German armies back to Berlin.
   Thousands of young Soviet men have been killed in the Afghan
fighting, thousands more wounded, and billions of rubles poured
into the war and accompanying efforts to make mountainous and
underdeveloped Afghanistan into a socialist country.
   This year the Soviets abandoned any pretense of seeking to
define their neighbor's future, with Gorbachev saying on Feb. 8
that the political and economic system of Afghanistan is ``none of
our business.''
   The drive into Afghanistan, launched when the late Leonid I.
Brezhnev was in power in the Soviet Union, poisoned the Kremlin's
relations with other Moslem and Third World countries and doomed
detente between the superpowers.
   From the U.S. withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty and
the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics by the United States and 61
other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements
involving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sending
tanks and troops across the Afghan border.
   Last November at the U.N. General Assembly, 123 nations, the
largest total to date, voted for a resolution calling for the
immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.
   ``The main question about Afghanistan is not the truth about the
horrors and the deaths, but why are we there?'' one Soviet war
veteran wrote in the weekly magazine Ogonyok last year.
   Many Soviets say that question has never been answered.
   ``Afghanistan is one of the great tragedies of our times that
has caused a worsening in international relations, led to the death
of many people and created a foyer of tension in the world,''
Sakharov said in February.
   A Moscow newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter of
receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in
Afghanistan. ``Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of the
letter said. ``But what did my boy die for?''
   The editor said he anguished over how to reply, and confessed,
``I have a stack of those letters on my desk, and I must answer
each one. But I don't know what to say.''
   Gorbachev said in February that the ``memory of those who have
died a hero's death in Afghanistan is sacred to us,'' and that
Soviet soldiers sent there ``have been performing their duty
honestly, performing acts of self-denial and heroism.''
   In recent weeks, state-run media have issued gloomy and
pessimistic reports on Afghanistan, presumably to prepare Soviet
citizens for continued strife there, and the media has accused
Moslem guerrillas of accelerating fighting in that country's
10-year-old civil war just as chances for peace improve.
   ``Terror on the eve of settlement,'' was the headline on one
Tass news agency dispatch this week, which accused the guerrillas
fighting the Soviet-backed government of President Najib of
``planting mines'' on the road to a peaceful settlement.
   Under the agreement negotiated at the U.N.-sponsored talks in
Geneva, Soviet troops are to begin their march home May 15 in a
pullout to be completed within nine months. All should be back home
by the end of the year, Soviet officials have said privately.
   Under Gorbachev's campaign for more openness, Soviet newspapers
and television have become more frank about the hardships faced by
soldiers sent to Afghanistan, and by returning veterans who meet
with official indifference or hostility.
   However, the horrors of the fighting in Afghanistan, which
Western sources say has resulted in up to 1 million civilian deaths
and 5 million refugees, have only been spottily reported in Soviet
media.
   The Soviet people have never been told how many of their sons
have been killed or wounded in the war, and officials refuse to say
publicly even how many Soviet troops are deployed.
   The U.S. State Department has estimated Soviet casualties since
1979 at 33,000-38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.
Those figures do not include ``heavy losses'' to disease, the
department said in a report issued in December.
   Reluctance to admit the full tragedy of the war, and the scope
of Kremlin involvement, exists throughout Soviet society.
   Graves of slain soldiers do not specify they were killed in
Afghanistan, some parents have publicly complained, and government
spokesman continue to refer to the conflict as ``the situation
around Afghanistan,'' rather than a war.
   In November, a veteran writing in Ogonyok urged Soviet
journalists to be forthright and ``call a dirty war a dirty war.''
   The Kremlin's current plans for Afghanistan are uncertain. On
Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said that under
the accords reached in Geneva, the United States would continue
aiding the Afghan rebels if the Soviets supply weapons to Najib's
government.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said on Tuesday the
Soviet Union hopes chances for peace in Afghanistan ``will continue
to evolve positively, and we hope the issue of arms supplies will
not remain long on the agenda.''

   A couple who fled their subsidized
housing because they said it was inhabited by supernatural forces
will get to argue their case in court.
   John and Helen Costello, who left their house last year with
their three teen-age daughters, are claiming they should be given
another government house because they are homeless. The city has
refused.
   The judge, Sir Michael Patrick Nolan, said on Wednesday that he
will allow a full High Court hearing even though the circumstances
of the case are ``highly unusual.'' No hearing date was set.
   The Costellos claim they saw moving furniture, a guitar playing
itself, power plugs being pulled from sockets and paper being
mysteriously ripped from a typewriter that had turned itself on.
   They claim police and social workers also saw some of the events.
   The city is housing the family in an inexpensive hotel but has
refused to give them another government home.

   In a junior high classroom in a state with
fewer than 3,000 Jews, sociologist Charles Hildebrandt holds up a
photograph of Adolf Hitler and speaks about the need to be a
``witness'' to the Holocaust.
   ``What were Aryans?'' Hildebrandt asked his Keene Junior High
School students Wednesday. Hildebrandt directs the Keene State
College Holocaust Resource Center, a library of more than 1,400
books, thousands of articles, films, slides and videotapes that
opened in 1983.
   The five ``gifted and talented'' children whose parents
permitted them to attend the optional, after-school course screwed
up their faces, indicating they didn't know about Aryans.
   ``They were supposed to be the super-race with blonde hair, blue
eyes, tall and strong,'' said Hildebrandt. ``The supermen that
would conquer the world, the super-race that would destroy all
these inferior races like the Jews.''
   The children, who like Hildebrandt are Christian, nodded
solemnly.
   This week, as groups across the country hold Holocaust memorials
to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprisings,
Hildebrandt is doing his part to ensure that the 6 million Jews who
died in Nazi death camps are not forgotten and that similar
atrocities never happen again.
   Education is ``what it's all about,'' he said. His lesson is not
lost on some of his students.
   ``It's not going to happen again because we listen and because
they're teaching us about it. If no one had said anything, then it
could easily happen again,'' said 11-year-old Erin Buzuvis.
   Hildebrandt was asked why New Hampshire needed the Holocaust
center, since its Jewish population is estimated by the Jewish
Federation of Greater Manchesterat at fewer than 3,000, or less
than one-third of one percent of the population.
   ``Why not?'' he replied. ``There should be a center everywhere.''
   As the state's handful of concentration camp survivors and
liberators die, it's even more important to convey the facts, he
said. Hildebrandt says many textbook writers are minimizing the
Holocaust; some even question the facts.
   ``There has to be a witness,'' he said.
   Hildebrandt does not dwell on the horror, but believes that
explaining the true events gradually is important. But how does a
teacher gradually describe genocide? How can gas chambers and
starvation be introduced without trauma?
   Hildebrandt advises elementary school teachers simply to begin
with classes on prejudice and less gruesome topics. For more
advanced children, he recommends two books:
   One is about a little girl, Rose Blanche, who sneaks food
through the barbed wire fence at a death camp. Her name, which
means white rose, is also the name of a German youth group that
resisted Hitler and eventually was eliminated.
   Another is about a little girl discovering concentration camp
numbers tatooed on her grandfather's arm and his explaining how
they got there. The book, illustrated by photographs of a girl and
an Auschwitz survivor, ends with the granddaughter saying, ``You
shouldn't be ashamed to let people see your number. You didn't do
anything wrong. It's the Nazis who should be ashamed.''
   By junior high and high school, Hildebrandt says, students
generally are better able to hear a more complete truth.
   Still, a couple of the children displayed some prejudices that
seem to indicate why Holocaust education is important _ especially
in areas with few minorities.
   ``It couldn't happen again because ... Jews aren't so Jewish
anymore,'' said one.
   ``They're more civilized,'' said another. ``They know more. They
act more like regular people.''

<TEXT>
   The federal government has chipped
in $11,000 to help save the 12-foot, gurgling earthworms that
transformed Korumburra from a near ghost town to a bustling tourist
attraction.
   Several years ago, Korumburra decided to promote the
invertebrate, which has 16 hearts and is a hermaphrodite, meaning
it is both male and female.
   The great Gippsland gurgling earthworm is so named because of
the sucking and gurgling noises it makes when it burrows, sounding
like a bathtub draining water. Townsfolk credit the earthworm,
whose scientific name is megascolides australis, for helping turn
their fortunes around.
   An annual worm festival called Karmai, after the aboriginal word
for giant earthworm, is held each March. It celebrates the worm
with parades, carnivals and even an earthworm queen.
   Recently, however, intensive farming in the worm's small habitat
has raised fears the worms' days are numbered.
   Korumburra is in Gippsland, an area of the southeast state of
Victoria that once was covered by a rain forest where the worms
thrived. Today, that habitat has been reduced to an area of 100
square miles around the Bass River.
   Settlers, who thought the worms were snakes, cleared Gippsland's
rain forest with its 300-foot trees in the 1880s to make room for
dairy farming and cattle raising.
   Although not officially protected, the earthworm is now listed
as endangered, according to worm expert Georgina Hickey of the
Australian Museum.
   Federal Environment Minister Graham Richardson announced an
$11,000 save-the-worm grant last week as part of a $383,000 package
to study other threatened species in Victoria, such as the koala
bear and the fairy penguin. Korumburra began exploiting the
earthworm as a tourist attraction in 1977 after the local coal mine
went bust, a butter plant shut down and young people began heading
to Melbourne, 75 miles away, in search of jobs.
   ``The worm saved the town,'' said Mark Holmes, on whose property
most of the worms are found. ``The worms helped people have an
identity. I don't know if they're proud of what they've got but
we've got something unique. We've got a thing that is dropping off
the face of the earth.''
   Promoting the giant worms wasn't easy, local tourist offical
Judith Nicholl admits. ``Of all things in the world, how do you
promote a worm?'' she told a recent visitor. ``It started out as a
fun thing but now it's very serious. Now when visitors arrive the
first thing they ask is `Where is the worm?'''
   Visitors now flock to Korumburra, population 2,800. The town's
shops display fluffy toy worms and cute cutouts on windows, colored
pink because brown, the worm's natural color, isn't attractive.
   Festivities climax with a 100-foot fake worm resembling a
Chinese dragon that is hoisted and weaved through main street by 60
or 70 children.
   A nocturnal animal, the worms are difficult to dig up and
residents discourage the practice because the worms can break apart
and bleed to death when yanked from the rich clay on which they
thrive.
   Townsfolk proclaim the worm as the world's largest, although
long worms are found elsewhere in the world.
   Despite their fame, the local worms remain underground. There is
no worm museum in Korumburra or even a display. However,
entrepreneurs John Matthews and Tony Zoanetti opened a worm
attraction at Bass, 25 miles down the highway toward the Phillip
Island penguin reserve, a major tourist attraction.
   There, visitors enter a 300-foot-long building shaped like an
earthworm and can walk through a section that simulates the
internal view of the worm's stomach, complete with gurgling noises.
   Visitors also experience a worm's eye view of its world below
ground. With a $3 entry fee for adults, up to 1,000 people visit
the attraction daily.

   Tokyo's key stock market indicator closed Thursday
at an all-time high, surpassing the 27,000-point level for the
first time, while the dollar eased against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 54.71-point
winner Wednesday, added another 125.80 points, or 0.46 percent,
finishing the day at 27,111.35.
   The dollar closed at 126.15 yen, down 0.30 yen from its 126.45
yen finish on Wednesday. It had opened the day at 126.20 yen and
ranged between 126.10-126.43 yen.
   A dealer at a major U.S. investment firm, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Wednesday's meeting in Washington of top finance
officials from seven major industrialized powers produced ``nothing
substantial.''
   The so-called Group of Seven nations are the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   In issuing its two-page joint communique Wednesday, the group
announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in which the seven
nations pledged to work together to keep the dollar currency from
falling further against the yen.
   ``The market was not looking for anything concrete from the
meeting,'' and it resulted in nothing new, the dealer said.
   He said Thursday's release in Washington of U.S. trade figures
for February would have a greater effect on the movement of the
dollar, and likely would support the currency.
   U.S. trade deficit reports have affected the dollar's direction
in recent years because the U.S. administration has supported a
lower dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.

   A couple who sought to adopt the baby of
an unmarried Navajo woman have agreed to give the girl back but vow
to fight alongside the mother to regain custody of the child from
tribal authorities.
   Despite the wishes of Allyssa Kristian Pitts' 21-year-old mother
and the couple that has cared for her since her birth July 20, a
judge has ruled that the child must be turned over today to Navajo
authorities.
   Patricia Keetso, who gave up Allyssa so that she could have a
life away from the reservation in Arizona, says she'll fight to get
her back and return her to the would-be adoptive parents, Cheryl
and Rick Pitts.
   ``I love my baby and want her to get something out of life,''
she said tearfully at the Pitts' home Wednesday.
   The Pittses, saying they are ``devastated'' by the prospect of
losing the baby they love and helped bring into the world, still
hope to get her back but aren't sure what will happen next.
   Keetso said her mother, who was brought to California for the
court hearings, was threatened with prison if the baby were not
returned.
   ``They've hassled my whole family,'' said Keetso, who has eight
brothers and sisters.
   The Navajo Nation's Tribal Department of Justice, citing the
Indian Child Welfare Act, filed a complaint in Santa Clara County
Superior Court in February to gain jurisdiction of the case and
stop the Pittses' adoption petition.
   Navajo officials said the adoption was illegal and demanded the
baby be sent to the reservation.
   After two hearings, Judge Leslie Nichols ordered the Pittses to
give up the child, ruling that Keetso was under tribal jurisdiction
and legally resided on the Arizona reservation she has visited only
occasionally in recent years.
   Rather than appeal Nichols' ruling, the Pittses decided
Wednesday to drop their adoption petition and fight to return
custody of Allyssa to Keetso. Eventually, they hope to get Allyssa
back.
   Keetso and Mrs. Pitts planned to accompany Allyssa back to
Arizona and try to persuade Navajo authorities to let them care for
the baby, who suffers from severe asthma.
   Keetso was pregnant when she met the Pittses through an adoption
attorney's advertisement.
   The couple, both 33 and parents of an 8-year-old boy, took
Keetso into their home. They gave her $200 a month spending money,
paid medical costs, coached her through labor and brought Allyssa
home.
   Keetso said the Indian Child Welfare Act was designed to protect
children.
   ``It was never supposed to do this, to take a baby from its
mother or interfere with a mother's decision about her child,'' she
said.
   ``The welfare people don't really care about anyone's feelings.
They're treating my baby like an object. They just want to take her
to prove a point.''
   Indian welfare officials in Arizona declined to comment about
the case. Violet A.P. Lui, the attorney handling the case at the
Tribal Department of Justice, did not return several phone calls.
   The Pittses have been encouraged by Dan and Patricia Carter of
Spanish Fork, Utah, who recently won a highly publicized,
seven-year custody fight with Navajo authorities over 10-year
Michael Halloway Carter.
   ``We spoke to them last night and they told us the only way we
can win is to go public and tell our story to anyone who'll
listen,'' Mrs. Pitts said.
   ``I love my baby. I've waited a long time for her. The bond we
have is very strong,'' she said. ``Sometimes she won't go to
anybody else. She wakes up at night crying and doesn't want to let
go of us.''

former and current presidential candidates have collected a total
of $50.7 million from the public treasury for the 1988 presidential
race.
   The commission said the $2.7 million given to the group on
Wednesday is included in that amount.
   Vice President George Bush received $322,500, bringing his total
FEC draw to $7.7 million _ second only to the $8.5 million given to
vanquished GOP rival Pat Robertson, who got $33,750 in the latest
allotment.
   Among the Democrats, Jesse Jackson got the largest new influx of
federal matching funds, $903,000, bringing the FEC total for the
once financially strapped candidate to $2.4 million. Michael
Dukakis received $827,000 on Wednesday, putting his total at $6.7
million. The only other Democrat still actively campaigning,
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., got $270,235, bringing his total to
$2.9 million.
   The federal fund matches every contribution of $250 or less that
the candidates raise from individuals.
   The fund is supported by the $1 voluntary checkoff on individual
income tax returns.

<HEAD>Brock Volunteers To Help Bush Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Bill Brock, who managed Bob
Dole's presidential campaign, has volunteered to help Vice
President George Bush since Dole withdrew from the race.
   Brock, who resigned as secretary of Labor to head the Senate
majority leader's campaign, said he woukld probably be a part-time
volunteer to the Bush campaign. But he said had no specific job in
mind when he spoke with the vice president.
   ``What it would entail I honestly don't know,'' Brock said in a
telephone interview on Wednesday. ``I didn't make any specific
suggestion to them.''
   Brock, who saw Dole's campaign crumble following the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 16, described Bush as a ``good and honest
man'' who had run a first-rate campaign.
   Brock, former chairman of the National Republican Executive
Committee who has been known in the past for his organizational
skills, said trying to run a successful Dole campaign against Bush
was nearly impossible.

<HEAD>Elections Board Spreads Word: Some NY Voters Need Not Show Up
Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential primary elections
have been called off in 16 New York congressional districts where
delegates supporting Vice President George Bush are running
unopposed.
   Under election rules, the Bush delegates have automatically been
designated as part of the New York delegation to the GOP national
convention in New Orleans, according to state Republican Committee
Executive Director Ed Lurie.
   That GOP delegation will include 136 members. Primary day voters
will select 96. The state Republican Committee will designate the
rest after the primary.
   Steven LaFever, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections,
said Wednesday the board is ``trying to spread the word'' that
voters will find Republican voting machines locked at polling
places in the 16 uncontested districts if they show up for
Tuesday's primary.
   As things stood Wednesday, registered Republicans can cast their
ballots in 16 of the state's 34 congressional districts on primary
day. Those districts have delegate slates on the ballot supporting
Bush and candidates opposing the vice president.

<HEAD>Dukakis Won't Adopt Flynn's Suggestion for Black VP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis says he won't limit his
vice presidential running mate choice to a black candidate as
suggested by Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   In outlining qualities he would want in a running mate Wednesday
when the Democratic presidential candidate was asked his opinion of
Flynn's suggestion Dukakis said, if nominated, he would try to pick
a running mate who ``first and foremost'' is qualified to serve as
president if called upon. Secondly, Dukakis said, he would seek a
vice presidential candidate who would strengthen the ticket.
   ``I certainly wouldn't limit the choice to any one group of
people,'' he added.
   Flynn, a supporter of Dukakis and an admirer of Jesse Jackson,
said he would like to see Jackson run as vice president. But if not
Jackson, Flynn said, then some other black should be on the ticket.
   ``I'd rather see the Democrats lose than win without a black on
the ticket,'' the mayor said.

<HEAD>Actress Jeff Donnell Dies of Heart Attack at 66</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Character actress Jeff Donnell, who portrayed
George Gobel's wife on the 1950s TV series, ``The George Gobel
Show'' and more recently appeared on the soap opera ``General
Hospital'' has died at age 66.
   Miss Donnell died Monday, after suffering an apparent a heart
attack at her Hollywood home, her son, Phineas Anderson, said
Wednesday.
   Miss Donnell, who acted in more than 50 films, was known most
recently to ``General Hospital'' fans as Stella Fields, the
Quartermaine family's housekeeper and Mrs. Quartermaine's partner
in a relish business, said Wendy Winter, an assistant to the
producer.
   Her movie roles included the ``Gidget'' films, ``The Blue
Gardenia,'' ``My Sister Eileen'' and ``Tora, Tora, Tora.''
   But she was best known for her role as Alice on ``The George
Gobel Show'' from 1954 to 1958.
   Miss Donnell's three marriages, to William R. Anderson, actor
Aldo Ray, and John Bricker, ended in divorce. She had been living
alone, Anderson said.
   In addition to her son, a Tucson, Ariz., resident, she is
survived by a daughter, Sally Durham, of Brisbane, Calif.

<HEAD>Feed Drug Found in Milk Samples, But Officials Say No Health
Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have found small residues of a
potentially cancer-causing animal drug in milk being sold in 10
U.S. cities, according to an official of the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The drug, sulfamethazine, is approved for use in pork and beef
cattle feed but is not supposed to be used in dairy cattle feed.
   ``The levels we were finding (in milk) should not cause a public
health problem, but we are concerned because this is an illegal use
and that drug must not be used in dairy cattle,'' Gerald Guest,
head of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a
statement Wednesday.
   ``We have been meeting with the appropriate industry groups, and
they already have programs under way to communicate this concern to
their respective industries,'' Guest said.
   FDA officials in early March bought and sampled pasteurized
whole milk from five grocery stores in each of the 10 cities _
Boston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver,
San Francisco, Seattle and New York.
   Of the 49 samples, 36 showed some sign of the drug, FDA
spokesman Chris Lecos said. Of the 36, he added, only five were
above trace levels.
   ``There is no reason for the public to be concerned about the
safety of the milk,'' Lecos said. ``The point is we don't want to
find it (sulfamethazine) in milk at all.''

<HEAD>Congress Urged To Clear Up Muddled Ash Picture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawsuits, barges searching to dump garbage,
and piles of refuse all serve notice that Congress needs to clear
up confusion over how states should handle incinerator ash, say
some local officials.
   ``Ordinarily, municipal officials, as I'm sure you well know,
resist and resent endless federal mandates,'' said Beulah
Coughenour from Indianapolis, who spoke on behalf of the National
League of Cities before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
Wednesday.
   ``This time we come before you from the opposite perspective. We
are here to ask for exactly that _ federal intervention in an area
that is uniquely a local government responsibility,'' Coughenour
said. ``Our need right now is for certainty.''
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Thomas told
the panel he supports the approach of a bill by Rep. Thomas Luken,
D-Ohio, that seeks to end confusion over the handling of ash from
140 municipal waste combustors processing about 15 million tons of
refuse each year.
   At issue is whether incinerator ash is to be considered
hazardous or non-hazardous solid waste. Thomas said EPA is looking
to Congress for help on whether ash from waste-to-energy
incinerators should be exempt from stringent hazardous waste
regulations that could mean high cost and lots of paperwork for
communities.

<HEAD>Bill Would Provide Greater Protection Against Crimes By Foreign
Diplomats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers, police officers and New York City
officials are endorsing a bill that would give American citizens
greater protection against crimes committed by foreign diplomats
and dependents who are immune from arrest or prosecution.
   ``The passage of this bill will send a clear message to those
lawbreakers who know our hands have been tied by the present laws,
that they will no longer be able to wave a paper called diplomatic
immunity and walk away scot-free,'' said Dennis Ray Martin, deputy
sheriff of Saginaw County in Michigan and president of the
68,000-member American Federation of Police.
   Under an international agreement which was approved by the
Senate in 1965 and implemented in 1978, ambassadors and other
diplomats and their family members enjoy complete immunity from
criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits, but various exceptions are
made for lesser personnel.
   The bill, sponsored Wednesday chiefly by Rep. Stephen J. Solarz,
D-N.Y., would put Congress on record as favoring State Department
action to obtain waivers of diplomatic immunity or the forced
departure of diplomats who are charged with serious crimes.
   The State Department said recently that it generally supports
the draft legislation but objects to several provisions as
unnecessary or potentially harmful to U.S. relations with other
countries.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Foster Care Law Not Being Enforced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foster children continue to be neglected and
mistreated despite a law meant to make sure they have safe and
permanent homes, preferably with their own families, say children's
rights advocates.
   The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Amendments passed in
1980 are not being enforced by the federal government or the states
and the results are devastating, Marcia Lowry, director of the
Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union
said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.
   Lowry was accompanied by a 12-year-old identified as Boyd A. who
spent years moving from one New York City foster home to another
while his mother, who had been temporarily hospitalized, used a
class action lawsuit to get her five children back.
   ``Sometimes we didn't like to visit our mother. You know why?
Sometimes they would have to tear us apart. We wouldn't leave. I
couldn't stand it,'' he said. ``They took almost five years away
from my life. That's almost one-half of my whole life that I spent
just waiting to come back to my real family.''
   More than 450,000 children spend some time in foster care each
year as a result of parental illness or disability, parent-child
conflicts, a child's severe emotional or behavioral problems or an
encounter with the law, said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., acting
chairman of the Ways and Means public assistance subcommittee.

<TEXT>
   A package from the University of Kentucky to
the father of a high school basketball star contained $1,000 in
cash, a newspaper reported today.
   Chris Mills of Los Angeles' Fairfax High School, his father and
university officials denied any knowledge of the money, the Daily
News reported.
   Mills signed a Nov. 11 letter of intent to accept a basketball
scholarship from the university, which was reprimanded last month
by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for minor
violations after a lengthy investigation of alleged substantial
payments made to other players.
   University President David P. Roselle, in a statement Wednesday,
said the school learned Friday of possible new NCAA violations from
a Daily News reporter's telephone call, and asked for NCAA help to
investigate.
   ``It is our intention to find out what happened, to report
everything we find to the NCAA, to take full responsibility for
whatever is proved to have occurred,'' he said.
   Mills, one of the top high school basketball players in
California, was heavily recruited across the nation. The 6-foot-7
Los Angeles City 4-A player of the year in 1987 scored an average
of 28.3 points a game.
   Charles Smrt, an investigator for the NCAA, was in Los Angeles
on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. He declined to discuss the case.
   A shipment record obtained by the Daily News showed the package
was sent March 30 via Emery Worldwide air freight by Kentucky
assistant basketball coach Dwane Casey to the player's father,
Claud Mills.
   In interviews in the last week, Emery employees told the Daily
News they noticed cash when a package broke open during handling
March 31 at their Los Angeles shipment center.
   Casey denied he put money in the package. ``We don't recruit
that way,'' Casey said. ``But I have never, ever put any money in a
package. That accusation is ridiculous.''
   Casey said the package he sent contained Claud Mills' videotape
of his son playing basketball.
   Claud Mills said he had been interviewed by the NCAA, and no
money was in the package when he got it. He acknowledged that an
Emery employee told him a package containing cash was addressed to
him and was awaiting delivery.
   His son said Friday that he knew nothing about any money from
the university, according to the newspaper.
   Officials at Kentucky denied any wrongdoing. ``I can promise you
it didn't occur,'' said Kentucky head basketball coach Eddie Sutton.
   NCAA officials said serious penalties could be imposed if the
allegation is substantiated.
   Eric Osborn, the Emery employee who found an opened package when
it arrived in Los Angeles, said he looked inside and saw money
sticking out of a videocassette box.
   His supervisor, Paul Perry, said he called over several
employees as witnesses and counted out $1,000 in $50 bills and then
had the package sealed by security personnel.
   Claud Mills acknowledged he received a videotape from Casey on
March 31. He said his son signed for the package and that when he
got home he found the videotape, but no cash, in the opened packet.
   ``I didn't receive no money from Dwane Casey,'' Claud Mills
said. ``Nobody from Kentucky gave me no money. They sent me a tape,
but I don't know nothing about no money.''
   Claud Mills said his son, a two-time Parade magazine
All-America, picked the University of Kentucky because of coach
Sutton, and the style of play there.
   Claud Mills said an NCAA investigator had questioned him earlier
about a car he bought for his son. He said he paid $6,800 for the
car, a 1984 Datsun 300ZX, with the proceeds of a lawsuit.

<HEAD>Congress Begins Hearings Into Matta Deportation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Honduran Congress began
hearings on the deportation of a reputed drug baron to the United
States that caused violent protests and forced the government to
impose a state of emergency.
   The emergency decree was issued for Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
Sula on April 8 after 2,000 demonstrators, enraged over the forced
extradition of Juan Ramon Matta, burned the U.S. Consulate and U.S.
Information Service office in the capital. The decree was lifted
Wednesday after tension subsided.
   Police and soldiers arrested Matta in a pre-dawn raid on his
Tegucigalpa home April 5 and deported him to the United States by
way of the Dominican Republic the following day without a passport.
The Honduran Constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   Matta, 43, a Honduran citizen, is being held at a maximum
security federal prison in Marion, Ill., on drug trafficking
charges. He also was wanted for questioning by U.S. authorities in
connection with the 1985 torture-slaying in Mexico of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Col. Leonel Riera Lunatti, commander of the public security
forces, testified behind closed doors for over two hours on
Wednesday before a congressional commission investigating the
deportation.
   Riera Lunatti arrived at the legislative chambers surrounded by
security guards and declined to comment to reporters.
   But Ramon Rufino Mejia, chairman of the hearing, said Riera
Lunatti testified he had broken into Matta's home at the orders of
superiors. Riera Lunatti stated the armed forces were responsible
for the operation, Rufino Mejia said.
   Judge Saul Suazo, who issued the search warrant authorizing the
break-in, also testified before the panel on Wednesday.
   Rufino Mejia said the commission planned to hear testimony from
Ramualdo Bueso, interior and justice minister; Maj. Efrain
Gutierrez, head of the government immigration department; Maj.
Santiago Perdomo, director of aviation; and Col. Marco Antonio
Chavez, chief of a local police district.
   The chairman refused to rule out the possibility the panel could
summon President Jose Azcona Hoyo to testify.
   ``We have begun a serious investigation into the affair because
we consider that no functionary, be he military or civilian, is
above Honduran laws,'' Rufino Mejia said.
   The government lifted the emergency decree and restored full
constitutional guarantees at 6 a.m. Wednesday in Tegucigalpa and
San Pedro Sula, 125 miles to the north. Business, commerce and
transportation operated normally.
   Five Hondurans died in the rioting last week. The U.S. Embassy,
located in the same complex as the burned offices, was not damaged.
   Police detained at least 70 people believed involved in the
attack, said Maj. Manuel Antonio Urbina, chief police spokesman.
   Honduras is a staunch U.S. ally, but some Hondurans protested
the presence of U.S. soldiers in their country and joint
U.S.-Honduran military exercises.
   Honduras was used as a base by U.S.-supported Contra rebels who
fought the leftist Nicaraguan government until last month's signing
of a cease-fire pact. Just before that agreement, the United States
sent 3,200 soldiers to Honduras after Nicaraguan troops reportedly
pursued Contras into Honduran territory.

<HEAD>PLO Seeks to Dismiss Action to Close U.N. Observer Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused one request to
temporarily block legal action to close the Palestine Liberation
Organization's United Nations observer mission.
   But U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri has scheduled an April
20 hearing on another request to block enforcement of the 1987
Anti-Terrorism Act. The law declared the PLO and its affiliates a
terrorist organization.
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the PLO are seeking to dismiss a federal
lawsuit that would force the closing of the mission.
   The government's lawsuit seeks a court order barring the PLO;
Zehdi Labib Terzi, head of the observer mission; and five other
mission officials or employees from continuing to operate the
mission or any other PLO office in this country.
   But PLO counsel Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general,
said in papers filed Monday at federal court that no U.S. court has
jurisdiction to issue such an order because it would violate
international law as well as the treaty setting up U.N.
headquarters in New York.
   The Justice Department has yet to file a response.
   In a related matter, Palmieri refused on Tuesday to grant a
preliminary injunction, blocking enforcement of the Anti-Terrorism
Act.
   He ruled that a group of U.S. citizens who say the act violates
their First Amendment rights had shown insufficient proof they
would suffer undue hardship or irreparable harm unless an
injunction were granted.
   Palmieri has scheduled a hearing for later this month on another
aspect of the lawsuit. Riyad Mansour, a U.S. citizen and No. 2
official at the PLO mission, said the law does not apply to him in
his official capacity at the United Nations, or if it does it is
unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Trial in Wrong County Starts Ethical, Legal Arguments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mistrial granted to a murder defendant whose
case was prosecuted in the wrong county has triggered debate on
whether he should go free, and on the ethics of his lawyer, who
knew about the error but kept mum.
   ``All this guy's got going for him is me,'' public defender Bob
Joiner said Wednesday. ``If I've got to help the prosecutor, my
God, he'd be better off without a lawyer.''
   Stephen Craig Schiefelbein, 38, was accused of fatally stabbing
a man who invited him to dinner Christmas Eve 1986 at an Atlanta
home that purportedly straddles the line between Fulton and DeKalb
counties.
   The mistrial was granted April 6, the second day of his trial in
Fulton County Superior Court, when a prosecutor learned that the
house actually is in DeKalb County and that Joiner had known it all
along.
   Joiner contends that his client should go free because a second
prosecution, this time in DeKalb County, would violate the
constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.
   ``It would be a miscarriage of justice if he were able to escape
because of a problem like that,'' said Steve Roberts, chief
assistant district attorney in DeKalb County, where the state may
press for a trial.
   Law officers in both counties assured prosecutors the house was
in Fulton County, said Assistant District Attorney Linda Finley,
who learned the truth when she telephoned a witness after the first
day of Schiefelbein's trial.
   Ms. Finley said she was reviewing the next day's testimony with
the owner of the house when ``he informed me that his house was in
fact about two houses over the line in DeKalb County.''
   The next day, Joiner said he had known of the mixup and Judge
Philip Etheridge declared a mistrial, telling Joiner he had
``wasted a lot of time and did your client absolutely no service
whatever.''
   Joiner said Wednesday it ``never even occurred to me'' to tell
the judge earlier because ethics rules for lawyers require him to
use any defense that is not frivolous.
   Joiner ``had an obligation not to say anything,'' said Geoffrey
C. Hazard Jr., a Yale Law School professor of legal ethics and the
main draftsman of the American Bar Association's model code of
ethics.
   ``The defendant in a criminal case is permitted to require the
state to go to its proof on every possible issue, and it's the
state's responsibility to carry the burden in that respect,''
Hazard said. ``The defendant did nothing to mislead the
prosecution, and I think (Joiner) did the right thing.''
   University of Georgia law professor L. Ray Patterson said legal
codes of ethics discourage disclosures of information by defense
lawyers but conflict with a lawyer's duties as an officer of the
court.
   ``Frankly, I sympathize with the lawyer,'' said Patterson, a
former dean of Emory University's law school. ``The courts have not
given good guidance on this. They've waffled on the issue.''
   Joiner says federal courts have held that part of a criminal
case is proving it is being brought in the right court, so failure
to prove that voids the entire prosecution. Another trial would be
double jeopardy, he said.
   Etheridge disagreed with that argument, saying his court never
really had jurisdiction over the case so ``anything we did would be
a nullity.''
   Roberts said the DeKalb County prosecutors already have found
legal precedents supporting a retrial, but no decision will be made
until the case file and the judge's order are received from Fulton
County.
   Joiner also contends that there are factual issues in the case.
   He said victim Michael G. Hadden, Schiefelbein and others in the
house had been drinking, that no one thought Hadden's wound was
serious enough to summon help, and he might have died simply from a
lack of medical attention.
   Schiefelbein also contends Hadden was choking him, he said.

   A Golden Beach waterfront house that wasn't cool
enough to suit him has Rodney Dangerfield a little hot under the
collar and demanding a little respect.
   Dangerfield said in a lawsuit he leased the house two years ago
for 10 days and $10,000, but was dismayed with the air conditioner.
The comedian chose to stay at the Bahia Mar Hotel in Fort
Lauderdale rather than return to the house, the lawsuit says.
   But Doreen Porecca, owner of the home, has refused to return
$9,000 Dangerfield paid in advance on the lease, according to
Dangerfield's Dade Circuit Court lawsuit.
   ``She said `Come back tomorrow, we'll try to fix it.' Well,
baby, Happy New Year. ... You know, baby, once I was gone, I was
gone,'' Dangerfield said at his deposition, taken last June and
filed this month.
   Dangerfield told defense lawyer Jesse Diner he liked his
accommodations to be cool, about 62 degrees.
   ``I can't sleep if I'm stuffed, you know, stuffy and hot,'' he
said.
   Next month, Diner will ask Judge Robert Kaye to dismiss
Dangerfield's suit. If not, the court date for the case is Aug. 8.

   Passengers freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti
jumbo jet said another gunman and a new supply of weapons came
aboard the plane when it landed in Iran, its first stop after being
seized last week.
   They also said the Shiite Moslem gunmen rigged the doors of the
Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 with explosives.
   One passenger who holds U.S. and Egyptian citizenship said he
kept the hijackers from discovering his American passport.
   Relatives, friends and Sheik Salem Al-Sabah, Kuwait's interior
minister, greeted the 12 released hostages when they arrived at the
airport in Kuwait on Wednesday. The 12 were freed in Larnaca on
Tuesday before the hijackers took the jet to Algeria, the third
stop in the ordeal that began April 5.
   Thirty-two hostages remained aboard the jet, including three
members of the extensive Kuwaiti royal family. They were held by
about eight hijackers.
   Arab women ululated in celebration at the Kuwait airport while
well-wishers pounded car roofs and shouted in joy as the 12 arrived.
   Aboard their plane were coffins containing the bodies of two
Kuwaitis, who were beaten, shot then dumped from the hijacked jet
onto the tarmac in Larnaca.
   The coffins _ draped in black, green and white Kuwaiti flags _
were carried to ambulances whose lights flashed on the dimly-lit
runway.
   Those released included five Egyptians and three Jordanians in
Western-style dress and four Kuwaitis wearing white robes and Arab
headdresses. The director of Larnaca General Hospital, Costas
Mallis, said the 12 men were ``physically all right, suffering
mainly from fatigue.''
   Adnan Rashid Majiki, a Kuwaiti in his 60s, said the hijackers
``were six but in Mashhad they became seven.''
   Kuwaiti news reports have quoted unidentified sources as saying
at least one additional hijacker joined the plane in Mashhad, Iran.
   ``They changed the crew, you know, their team,'' passenger
Ramadan Ali told NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``One of them left ...
and another two guys came over ... and they provided them with new
weapons ... and bombs ... and ropes ... and explosives.''
   Ali, who holds U.S. and Egyptian citzenship, said he hid his
American passport in his briefcase.
   He said the hijackers asked passengers ``if somebody was
stopping in America, or (was a) U.S. citizen. I told them I can't
afford it, you know it's very expensive to go to this country.''
   ``I was scared ... very scared, because if they searched my
briefcase you know I would be the first one to get shot,'' Ali said.
   ``Minute-to-minute I ... was expecting (the hijacker), you know,
to grab me ... like (a) chicken from the chicken nest and kill me
as he did, you know, those other two Kuwaiti guys,'' he said.
   Another freed hostage said the hijackers questioned their
captives about what kind of lives they led.
   ``We were asked about our religion, and how many children we
had, and about our work,'' said Saleh Ibrahim Malak, a Kuwaiti in
his 30s. The hijackers had said they freed hostages who were poor
or who had many children.
   ``I saw explosives tied to the doors,'' Malak said. ``I saw
strings tied around the doors.''
   The gunmen said repeatedly they were prepared to blow the plane
up if 17 pro-Iranian Moslems jailed in Kuwait on terrorism
convictions weren't released. Kuwait has refused.
   ``There were two handsome ones in their early 20s and two in
their 30s,'' Malak said.
   An Egyptian, Sharif Mamdouh Badrawi, said the Koran, the Moslem
holy book, helped him endure the ordeal. ``I feel as if I'm born
again,'' he said. ``I read the entire Koran on the plane.''
   Badrawi said scars on his hands were caused by a rope used to
tie them up, but ``despite the cuffs I could turn the pages of the
Koran. They (gunmen) liked that and patted my shoulder.''
   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan, 32, of Cairo, said: ``They used to
tell us, `We will either all die together or live together.'''
   ``Yesterday, before they let us go, two hijackers appeared
wearing napkins round their necks on which they had written,
`Martyrdom Is Our Love.'''
   Rehan said, ``I was hit on the face once when I locked the door
of the toilet, something they told us not to do.''
   But he said one gunman joked with the hostages and offered them
cigarettes.
   Rehan said the more elderly hostages were treated kindly, and so
were three members of the Kuwaiti royal family _ Fadel Khaled
Al-Sabah, a businessman in his 40s, and his sisters Ebtesam and
Anware, who are in their 30s.
   ``The royals were treated very well, especially the women,'' he
said. ``But their brother is the one who looks broken down
psychologically.''
   The released passengers were interviewed at the hospital or at
the airport.
   The Kuwait Airways jumbo jet was hijacked April 5 with 112
people aboard on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight and diverted to Iran. It
flew to Cyprus on Friday and then to Algiers on Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Prisoner Tells of Sandinista Abuse, Threats _ Says Cubans Involved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot held five years in Sandinista prisons said
he was threatened with death and denied medical treatment as part
of systematic psychological torture apparently directed by Cuban
intelligence agents.
   Roberto Amador, 42, shot down during a Contra supply flight in
1983, was one of the first prisoners freed as part of last month's
truce agreement between the Nicaraguan Resistance and the leftist
Sandinista government.
   He arrived here Saturday to join his wife and three children.
   Amador and other Contra officials said at a news conference here
Wednesday they believe there are up to 12,000 political prisoners
inside Nicaraguan jails despite government claims to the contrary.
   Amador said he had been threatened before leaving Nicaragua and
told not to talk to reporters.
   ``They told me, `If you make declarations to the press in the
United States, we will put a bomb in your car in Miami or anywhere
else you go,''' said Amador. They reminded him of the assassination
of former Nicaraguan dicator Anastasio Somoza in Paraguay after he
fled the Sandinista revolution in 1979.
   Amador, 42, said at least three of the seven crew members on his
doomed 1983 flight died in Sandinista hands even though all
survived the crash of their plane, which he said was flying
medicine, books and clothes to the rebels.
   When they were captured, some of the men were bound hand and
foot and flown to El Chipote prison in Managua.
   ``We expected death at any minute,'' said Amador. ``They said
they were going to kill us.''
   Two crew members stayed behind and were never heard from again,
and he later found a third was officially reported dead.
   At the prison, where he was kept in solitary confinement for 1{
years, Amador was regularly seated for 12 to 16 hours in a chair
while he was threatened and interrogated.
   In the partially darkened room, he said, he could hear
Cuban-accented men speaking Spanish and occasionally heard German,
which he believed was spoken by East German advisers. Two Cuban
exile Contra sympathizers still in prison in Nicaragua later told
him they were being interrogated by Cuban G-2 intelligence agents,
he said.
   He said he believes the Cubans were teaching their techniques to
the Sandinistas.
   ``They worked on the mind with constant death threats,'' said
Amador. ``They told me if I didn't talk they would get my family in
the United States, they would kill my children, and they would kill
me.'' At one point they falsely claimed they were holding ``someone
I loved,'' the pilot said.
   He said the guards held drills in which they would send soldiers
to the door of each cell and point a Soviet-made rifle at the
prisoners.
   ``They were waiting for an American invasion,'' said Amador.
``They said as soon as the 82nd (Airborne Division) landed, we
would be eliminated.''
   Amador said he was told his family, the United States, and the
resistance had abandoned him.
   The pilot suffered what he later found out was a crushed disc
during his crash landing, and was in constant pain, which his
interrogators used against him, he said.
   ``They would open the cabinet and show me the medicine for my
pain,'' he said. ``Then they would say, `are you going to talk?'''
He said he refused and was never given the pain-reliever. Doctors
in the United States later said his jailers had unintentionally
helped him by forcing him to sleep on the floor, giving some relief
to his back.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Hit Record High In Japan; Dollar Down Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today
closed above 27,000 points for the first time, while the dollar
fell marginally against the Japanese yen in quiet trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 54.71-point
winner Wednesday, reached a record high for the fifth time since
last Thursday, adding another 125.80 points, or 0.46 percent, to
finish the day at 27,111.35.
   Since the current upward trend began at the end of March, the
Nikkei index surged by about 1,400 points.
   The market continued to be in a bullish mood, boosted by the
agreement by the seven top industrialized nations to work together
to keep the U.S currency from falling further and by prospects for
favorable U.S. trade figures to be announced today in Washigton,
said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   In a two-page, joint communique issued Wednesday in Washington,
the finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven
nations announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in which
they pledged to work together to keep the U.S. currency from
falling further against the Japanese yen.
   Participating in the meeting were the United States, Japan,
France, Britain, Canada, Italy and Germany.
   Shimoyama said share prices were generally higher with
construction and housing issues among the most popular.
   There was nothing to hold the market back and the major brokers
were apparently determined to push the Nikkei index through the
27,000 barrier, traders said.
   Volume of the first-section trade was a heavy 1.2 billion
shares, up from 1 billion shares on Wednesday. Advancing issues
outpaced decliners 504 to 375, while 185 issues were unchanged.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
126.15 yen, down 0.30 from its close of 126.45 yen Wednesday. It
had opened the day at 126.20 and ranged between 126.10-126.43 yen.
   ``The meeting in Washington of the seven major nations didn't
really affect trading, as the results were what had been
expected,'' said Makoto Sato of the Bank of Tokyo. He said the
market was rather quiet while awiting the announcement of U.S.
trade figures today in Washington.
   The United States' huge trade deficit has affected the dollar's
direction in recent months because the U.S. government has
supported a lower dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.

<HEAD>Effort to Recall Denver Mayor Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A months-long effort to recall Mayor Federico Pena
on grounds of mismanagement was rebuffed when a city official
announced the number of signatures on petitions fell more than
2,000 short of the total needed.
   The backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to
the Denver Election Commission on Wednesday, beating a 5 p.m.
deadline by several hours and expressing confidence there would be
enough valid signatures to support a new mayoral election.
   But late Wednesday Felicia Muftic, president of the election
commission, said only 36,960 names were counted, short of the
minimum 39,091 needed. The validity of the signatures was not
checked.
   Pena reacted with pleasure, saying, ``To those people who
opposed the recall, I thank you. To those people who supported the
recall, I urge you to join with the city to help move the city
forward. These are critical times and we cannot afford to have any
disunity.''
   Critics, however, said the troubled city government will only be
worse unless Pena gets the message and starts ``running things in a
little better way,'' as city councilman Paul Swalm said.
   ``If he doesn't, why you know I just think the city is going to
be in very bad shape in a year or two. It's already in bad shape
now, but it'll be worse,'' he said.
   Pena, 41, one of the first Hispanics to be mayor of a major U.S.
city, was elected to his second term last June by 3,000 votes in a
hotly disputed contest that required a runoff of top contenders.
   The recall drive was started by a group angered over what they
claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the Pena administration. The
group gathered supporters among a number of Denver residents left
stranded for several days by a major holiday snow storm.
   Maintenance crews plowed major traffic arteries, leaving side
streets filled with snow for several days. At the time, Pena was
vacationing out-of-state.
   The 39,091 votes needed for the recall represented 25 percent of
the voters in the last mayoral election, said Sam Tarkington,
executive director of the election commission.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Blames National Unrest On Education, Secret Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the KGB secret police blamed ethnic
unrest that broke out in two southern republics and other areas of
the Soviet Union on poor education and foreign secret services.
   Viktor Chebrikov's speech on Wednesday in the Volga River city
of Cheboksary was his first public comment on ethnic tensions in
the Soviet Union since rioting occurred in the Azerbaijan republic
on Feb. 28.
   At least 32 people were killed in the rioting, 26 of them ethnic
Armenians. Thousands of people began mass protests in neighboring
Armenia in mid-February to demand that the Nagorno-Karabakh region
of Azerbaijan be annexed to Armenia.
   Three-quarters of the region's residents are ethnic Armenians,
who traditionally are Christians. Azerbaijanis traditionally are
Moslems.
   Chebrikov did not mention Azerbaijan and Armenia, but said
``anti-social actions of a nationalistic nature took place in a
number of regions of this country,'' according to a report issued
by the Tass news agency.
   ``I believe that one of the major reasons for those anti-social
actions is a serious negliect of the internationalist education of
popular masses,'' Chebrikov was quoted as saying.
   He also blamed wrong approaches to solving social-economic
problems, and said ``groundless notions'' about the problem-free
development of relations between nationalities also played a part.
   The latter was an apparent reference to the Soviet Union's
claims in the past to have solved the problem of relations among
nationalities.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said at a Communist Party
Central Committee meeting in February that the problem is one of
the country's most serious, and that the Central Committee will
devote an upcoming meeting to it.
   The Soviet Union, a country of more than 100 ethnic groups,
tries to teach citizens to de-emphasize nationalistic feelings in
favor of what is termed a spirit of friendship and equality with
other ethnic groups.
   But ethnic groups often resent domination by Russians and other
Slavs, and ages-old tensions exist among some of the ethnic groups.
   Chebrikov also said that foreign secret service organizations
that he did not identify played a part in stirring up ethnic
tensions. ``It is an open secrety that secret services of
imperalist powers and foreign anti-Soviet centers actively join
extremist nationalistic actions,'' he said.
   ``Later on they start playing the part of open instigators of
hostile actions aimed at kindling hostility among nations,''
Chebrikov said.
   ``One should not underestimate the danger of this method of
subversive actions against this country. However, in my opinion,
the main attention should be concentrated on a timely solution of
the emerging socio-economic problems, on the education in patriotic
and internationalist spirit,'' he said.
   In a televised speech in September, Chebrikov accused the West
of trying to undermine Soviet economic reforms and sow discord
among nationalities.
   Besides the tensions in Armenia and Azerbaijan, there also has
been an increase in nationalist activities in the Baltic republics
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, in Kazakhstan, and among Crimean
Tatars who were deported from their homeland by Stalin because of
alleged cooperation with Nazi invaders in World War II.

   Rush hour traffic came to a two-minute
standstill today as the wail of air raid sirens opened Israel's
annual memorial day for the 6 million European Jews slain by the
Nazis in World War II.
   The nation's radio stations played melancholy tunes throughout
the day. Restaurants and houses of entertainment were shut by law
for 24 hours ending at sundown today.
   More than 100 memorial ceremonies were scheduled throughout the
country.
   Holocaust Day, officially called Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance
Day, is commemorated on the anniversary of the start of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Polish Jews used pistols to fight
Nazis in tanks.
   This year, the commemoration comes amidst a four-month spate of
anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories that has claimed
the lives of 144 Palestinians and two Israelis.
   The conflict played a prominent role in an emotional speech
given by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at a memorial ceremony at
Jerusalem's Yad Vashem monument Wednesday night.
   ``We again face the phenomenon of eternal hatred for the eternal
people ... When will the nations learn that they can never overcome
us and decide to leave us alone,'' Shamir said.
   ``Even today when we dwell in our own land, evil-hearted and
unfeeling people shoot poison arrows at our youngsters and they
wander the countryside, turning it into a valley of death,'' he
added.
   His statement was seen as an allusion to the killing of a
teen-aged Jewish settler during a clash in the West Bank village of
Beita last week as well as other attacks against Israelis in the
occupied areas.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Israel would seek
clarifications from Poland today about reports a government
spokesman in Warsaw criticized Israel's tactics in the occupied
territories and linked it to the Holocaust.
   The Polish spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said on Tuesday at a news
conference that Israel's ``brutal behavior'' was an ``offense to
the memory'' of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto.
   Despite the controversy, 2,000 Israelis, including teen-agers,
two Cabinet ministers and six legislators, flew to Warsaw this week
for observances of the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto
revolt, which took a month to crush.
   Although the generation of Holocaust survivors has dwindled in
numbers, interest in the tragedy has been rekindled in young
Israelis in part because of the war crimes trial of retired Ohio
autoworker John Demjanjuk, which was televised nationwide. Judges
are expected to issue a verdict next week.
   Demjanjuk is accused of operating the gas chambers at the
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews
perished. He claims he is a victim of mistaken identity.
   The renewed interest in the Holocaust was dramatized by a
well-attended concert Wednesday night staged by two popular rock
singers, Shlomo Artzi and Yehuda Policker, whose parents survived
concentration camps.
   Policker's new album, ``The Stop for Treblinka,'' is about the
trains used to ship Jews to the death camps.
   In an editorial, Al Hamishmar daily wrote: ``This year's
Holocaust Day distances us another year from those days of horror
but does not weaken their memory.''
   ``Survivors' children have absorbed the memory of the terror and
loss. It inhabits the world of every Israeli and has become an
inseparable part of the nation's memory and mission.''

   The right-wing Nationalist
Republican Alliance said it will appeal to the Supreme Court a
decision denying its request for a recount of votes for a disputed
assembly seat.
   The Central Elections Council on Wednesday turned down the
party's request for a new vote tally in eastern La Union province.
The council said in a statement the demand was ``inappropriate.''
   The decision effectively denied the party, known as Arena, a
majority in the new legislative assembly.
   Arena's president, Alfredo Cristiani, said his party would
appeal to the Supreme Court to reverse the council decision. He
said the panel's ruling ``was no surprise.''
   ``It was difficult to hope for a response favorable to us when
the accused is also the judge,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Arena contends its candidates won 31 of the 60 seats in the
National Assembly during nationwide elections March 20.
   Final election results announced last week by the Council gave
Arena 30 seats, the Christian Democratic Party 23 and the National
Conciliation Party seven. The Christian Democrats had held a
majority before the election.
   Arena claims the National Conciliation Party conspired with the
Christian Democrats to commit fraud. National Conciliation Party
members have indicated they will align with the Christian Democrats
to form a voting bloc in the assembly.
   The results could produce a legislative deadlock during
Christian Democratic President Jose Napoleon Duarte's final year in
office.
   The Supreme Court could delay ruling on Arena's appeal for many
months, effectively putting an end to the dispute by inaction.
   All parties have agreed the dispute will not prevent the
installation of the new assembly May 1, with the composition
announced by the council.

   A U.N. health official who visited
Israel's occupied territories said today that Palestinians are
suffering abdominal pain, miscarriages and muscular weakness from
tear gas Israel is using against them.
   Dr. John Hiddlestone, U.N. Relief and Works Agency director of
health affairs, said in a telephone interview that he saw
Palestinians experiencing symptoms ``which were not those usually
associated with tear gas.''
   But he added: ``I'm not actually accusing anybody of anything.''
   The agency said the gas was being used improperly. The Israeli
army denied the charge.
   Agency spokesman Ron Wilkinson reported several cases in which
tear gas had been thrown into closed areas, houses, schools and a
clinic in Israeli-held territory.
   ``It says right on the canisters that it must not be used in a
confined area. So it (the gas) has particular toxic effects when it
is thrown into a room,'' he said.
   ``One label says: `For outdoor use only. Contents may cause
severe injury if not used in accordance with this warning
instruction.'''
   In the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, agency spokeswoman Christine
Debaigh said a 70-year-old woman, Wadfah Farraj Allah, was dead on
arrival at Jabaliya's U.N. clinic on Wednesday after troops hurled
a tear gas canister into her home.
   Shifa Hospital officials said Mrs. Allah suffocated after
inhaling the gas. An army spokesman denied the account and said
that ``results of an autopsy carried out by the (government-run)
Pathological Institute in Abu Kabir showed the woman died of
natural causes.''
   UNRWA is providing shelter, education and medical assistance to
Palestinian refugees living in the Middle East.
   ``I am a physician and my worry is that people are having other
symptoms than normal tear gas symptoms,'' Hiddlestone said.
   ``We need to know what's being used in the hope we can do more
for these people because the abdominal pain is extremely severe of
women who have been miscarrying and have had premature labor,'' he
said.
   The doctor said he also met people suffering from ``great
muscular weakness'' after exposure to gas used by the Israelis.
   He said those ailments occurred without eye, nose or throat
irritation, ``so that even though you have tear gas which is in
improper concentrations when it's put into closed spaces, the
symptomatology of some people is not that which is normal as a
result of tear gas.''
   An army spokesman said: ``There is no truth to the report we are
using a new type of toxic gas. The purpose of tear gas is to limit
casualties and to cause as little damage as possible by avoiding
physical confrontation with the rioters.''
   He said tear gas could be lethal if inhaled by people already
suffering from heart or other health problems, or if used in a
small enclosed space.
   ``The army does not use tear gas in small enclosed spaces, at
least not on purpose,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights has expressed
concern that the Israelis may be misusing tear gas.
   The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a lobbying
group, contends that more than 30 people have died in Israel and in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from exposure to tear gas.

   Fire raged out of control for eight hours along
the Baltimore waterfront, shooting flames 100 feet into the air and
filling the sky with thick, black smoke. Three businesses were
destroyed.
   More than 200 firefighters battled the intense heat and flames
of the seven-alarm blaze, which was not brought under control until
6:30 a.m. today. Five firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   The fire was discovered about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday at an
automotive lubricant company, and arson was suspected, said Fire
Department spokesman Capt. Patrick Flynn.
   ``It's a very hot fire,'' Flynn said during the night battle.
The solvents and motor oils ``added a lot of fuel to the fire. The
troubling thing about this, you don't know what's going to happen
next.''
   The fire threatened the vacant Allied Chemical plant, but did
not reach the building. Fire officials had been afraid the heat
would trigger an explosion there.
   The fire apparently began at Autoline Lubricants Inc., and sent
55-gallon drums of oil and lubricants rocketing into the sky. It
spread to Atlantic Mill and Lumber Co., then engulfed Lacy
Foundries.
   ``It looked like the world was on fire,'' said Meg Craft, 36,
who was awakened when an explosion shook her home.
   The area lies on a peninsula across the water from the Inner
Harbor and a few blocks from the historic Fells Point area.
   The flames soared 100 feet into the air and could be seen for
several miles, drawing Fells Point residents into the streets to
watch. Dense, black clouds of smoke hung over the area.
   The fire went to seven alarms within a half-hour, Flynn said.
Firefighters stood poised on hydraulic booms, aiming their hoses
down onto the blaze, while others manned fireboats in the harbor.
   Autoline President Edward Peres, 46, and executive vice
president Bob Scott, 45, watched somberly. Peres said the company
had about $1.2 million in inventory.
   Autoline receptionist Sally Nowicki, 33, was near tears. ``It's
terrible, it's awful, My heart just aches for them,'' she said of
Peres and Scott. ``They're watching everything they owned go up in
smoke. They worked so hard, they don't deserve this.''
   ``I'm in no condition to talk,'' said Sidney Meyer, president of
Atlantic Mill and Lumber. ``I'm in shock.''

<HEAD>Study: Prison Population, Already at Capacity, to Grow 21 Percent
by 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Get-tough criminal laws may satisfy public
opinion, but they are failing to cut crime rates and are forcing
prison officials to cope with even more prison crowding, a new
study concludes.
   ``The prison route, the idea that we ought to send everybody to
prison and keep them there, just doesn't work,'' said John Austin
of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.
   ``In California, for instance, the number of inmates has tripled
since 1977, and the crime rate has not dropped 1 percent,'' he said
Wednesday.
   The mandatory sentencing laws _ so-called ``get-tough'' measures
_ will play a key role in the projected 21 percent increase in the
nation's prison population by 1992, said Austin, director of
research for the San Francisco-based criminal-justice think tank.
   The study, based on the crime and incarceration rates for nine
states, projects a 30 percent increase in parolees over the same
five-year period.
   The nine states studied were California, Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Again using California as an example, Austin said its current
inmate population of 69,000 could almost double to 125,000 within
10 years.
   ``I'm not saying it's going to happen,'' he said, ``but it
certainly could happen if we keep the current policies intact.''
   Austin said the money for prisons is siphoning off funds that
could be used for other human services _ medical, education and
welfare _ that eventually might make a dent in prison population
growth.
   ``The generation we need to be concerned about is not the one in
prison right now, but the kids who are 10, 11 and 12 years,''
Austin said at a news conference.
   The most immediate solution to crowding is early-release
programs for prisoners not in maximum security, he said.
   Austin said the average prison term is two years, and simply
trimming three months from each would provide significant relief,
``especially since studies have shown us that releasing these
people early doesn't drive up the (crime) rate.''
   The new study also highlighted several problems correctional
officials likely will face in the future, including an aging inmate
population requiring expensive medical services and an increasing
number of black and Hispanic males in prison.

<HEAD>President Says Explosion At Ammunition Dump Was Sabotage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said
today that sabotage caused an explosion at an ammunition dump that
killed at least 96 people.
   Zia also denied that the weapons in the dump were intended for
guerrillas fighting the government of neighboring Afghanistan.
   ``My personal assessment is that it couldn't be anything but a
very effective way of sabotage,'' Zia told reporters at an informal
briefing at the presidential place.
   ``Somebody who is not in line with us,'' was responsible, he
said. The president would not elaborate, citing the ongoing
investigation into Sunday's blast at the ammunition depot between
Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   The latest death toll stands at 96, but officials said scores of
people were still missing. More than 1,000 were reported injured by
the explosion, which send rockets flying into the cities.
   Zia said the depot was used only by the army of Pakistan and
that none of the weapons was destined for the Afghan guerrillas,
who have headquarters in Pakistan. The guerrillas receive foreign
military aid, inlcuding U.S. arms, through Pakistan.
   Eyewitnesses said that after the explosion and fire, they saw
burning trucks with Afghan license plates near the dump.
   Moslem guerrillas have been at war with the Afghan government
for 10 years, since a communist coup installed a government
friendly to the Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Bernie Simon, who once said that
achieving the office fulfilled a lifetime dream, died today after a
yearlong battle against cancer. He was 60.
   Simon was was taken to Methodist Hospital by rescue squad before
dawn and was pronounced dead on arrival, said Anne Johnson, Simon's
press aide.
   Simon became mayor on Feb. 3, 1987, after he was chosen by the
City Council to fill out the 2{ years left in the term of Mike
Boyle, who was recalled from office in a special election.
   Simon said he had considered running for mayor in 1989 and that
achieving the office fulfilled a lifetime dream.
   A native of Omaha, Simon was an all-city tackle on the Creighton
Preparatory High School football team in 1944. After graduating in
1945, he served briefly in the U.S. Navy before the end of World
War II.
   He then went to work as a lineman for Northwestern Bell and
retired in 1981 as a marketing manager.
   Simon sought treatment for alcoholism in 1979 and said he
abstained from drinking ever since.
   A Democrat, he was elected to the City Council in 1981 and
re-elected in 1985.
   When he took over as mayor, Simon said: ``I'm not ready to sit
down in a rocking chair. It's a zest for life.''
   He was in office only two months when doctors discovered an
inoperable tumor in his lungs. That tumor was destroyed during
treatment, but two more tumors showed up in Simon's brain later in
the year.
   ``Don't look so gloomy,'' he told reporters then. ``I've whipped
cancer before and I'm going to whip this one.''
   Radiation treatments and chemotherapy reduced the tumors, but
they reappeared just before Christmas. Simon kept up a full
schedule as mayor until March, when he began taking time off to
rest.
   Acting Mayor Fred Conley was informed of Simon's death by
Simon's son, Ray.

<HEAD>Father Awarded Custody Of Contractually Conceived Twins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of 7-month-old twins conceived
under contract has agreed to relinquish custody of the children to
their father and avoid a court battle.
   Laurie and Richard Yates decided to let Barry and Glinda Huber
of Jonesboro, Ark., have permanent custody of the twins, lawyer
Kathleen Boyle, who represented the Hubers, said.
   ``It was probably the ultimate act of love on Laurie Yates'
part,'' attorney Robert MacAlpine, who negotiated the settlement
for the Yateses, said Wednesday.
   ``They realized that in their precarious financial condition
they could never provide the kind of home for the twins that the
Hubers could,'' he said. Both Laurie and Richard Yates, of Ithaca,
are unemployed.
   Noel Keane, the Dearborn attorney who arranged the contract that
led to the twins' birth, said he believed the babies ``ended up
where they should and where I think would be obviously in their
best interest.''
   The Hubers paid Keane $10,000 for matching them up with Mrs.
Yates and arranging for her to be inseminated with Huber's sperm.
   There was no payment to Mrs. Yates, Boyle and MacAlpine said.
   The custody agreement was approved late Tuesday by Circuit Judge
Timothy Green, who voided the surrogate parenting contract last
January, calling it unenforceable and contrary to public policy.
   A trial to determine which couple should be awarded custody was
scheduled to begin next week.
   Under the agreement, the birth certificates of the children,
born Sept. 4, 1987, will be changed to give them the surname of
Huber, Boyle and MacAlpine said. Their first names will remain
Stephanie and Anthony, MacAlpine said.
   The Yates couple's decision was influenced in part by reports of
a psychologist and psychiatrist who both concluded the Hubers were
the better choice to raise the twins, according to Lisa Vogler, the
Yateses' attorney.
   Briefs filed in the case showed that Mrs. Yates once pleaded
guilty to receiving stolen property and that her husband was twice
convicted for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of
alcohol.
   In contrast, the Arkansas farm couple was portrayed as ``stable,
loving and hardworking ... with no history of criminal activity or
drug or alcohol abuse.''
   Mrs. Yates, who filed her custody suit before the twins were
born, has actively supported a drive to outlaw commercial
surrogacy, appearing at news conferences, testifying before
legislative committees, telling her story on television interview
shows.
   Good Housekeeping magazine paid $25,000 to Mrs. Yates' legal
defense fund for rights to her story.
   Under the terms of the court order, part of that money will be
used to reimburse the state for the cost of the twins' delivery,
which was paid through the Medicaid program.

<HEAD>Convicted Ex-Reagan Aide Still Proclaims Innocence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House political director Lyn
Nofziger said today he felt ``a total lack of remorse'' as he
continued to claim innocence despite his recent conviction for
illegally lobbying his former government colleagues on behalf of
the scandal-ridden Wedtech Corp. and others.
   ``You have to be guilty before you can feel remorse. I do not
think I'm guilty,'' Nofziger said in an interview on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   ``If you want me to go out and grovel in order to avoid this
kind of a sentence, I'm going to get the sentence,'' said Nofziger.
Last week he was given a 90-day prison sentence and fined $30,000
for three counts of illegally lobbying then-presidential counselor
Edwin Meese and other White House aides.
   When he was sentenced, Nofziger charged that prosecutor James C.
McKay was ``out to get'' him ``because I would not cop a plea and
because I would not say I was remorseful.''
   ``We were not allowed to plead that we had advice of counsel,''
Nofziger said today. ``We did talk to lawyers.''
   Nofziger, 63, also repeated his criticism of the ethics statute,
saying, ``We also find the law very vague. We think it's
unconstitutionally vague. It doesn't really tell you what you can
do and what you can't do.''
   Nofziger said he does think there should be some kind of ethics
law applicable to former government employees but it should not
interfere with constitutional rights. The former White House aide
charged that the current law tells you ``you can't do what the
Constitution tells you you can do.''
   Nofziger was asked whether he thought President Reagan has been
hurt by the cases of former aides being accused and convicted of
violating laws in connection with their service in his
administration. Nofziger, a longtime Reagan friend, said, ``Most of
the people who have gotten in so-called trouble, it's been after
they got out. ... I don't know why anybody should blame the
president for things that have happened to people after they left
the White House.''

   The Environmental Protection Agency today
declined to establish a new clean air standard to protect
asthmatics from peak exposures to sulfur dioxide that might last
only a few minutes.
   Those exposures might occur around sources that meet all current
standards based on longer measurement times, sources like
coal-burning power plants, smelters and factory boilers.
   A burst of emissions from a plant, or even rare wind patterns,
might cause people living nearby to face high concentrations
briefly.
   Environmentalists denounced the decision embodied in a draft
affirmation of current standards.
   ``There is a whole slew of evidence'' accumulated since 1980
that many asthmatics are not being protected by current standards,
said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council,
claiming that ``for this administration the wishes of the utility
industry always come first.''
   Bob Yuhnke of the Environmental Defense Fund said his
organization would try to get a court to order a short-term
standard established.
   At the Edison Electric Institute, the principal trade
association for utilities, spokeswoman Susan Roth said EPA's
decision ``reflects a careful weighing of all the scientific
evidence.'' She said current standards reduced average sulfur
dioxide concentrations by 37 percent between 1977 and 1986. The
institute has said a stringent short-term standard could be as
costly as an acid rain control program, perhaps $5 billion a year.
   Sulfur dioxide is the major raw material for acid rain, but acid
rain is not an issue in EPA's decision about ground-level
concentrations of sulfur dioxide.
   According to EPA's announcement, new studies have found
``measurable changes in respiratory function and symptomatic
effects _ shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing _ in asthmatics
exposed for short periods, five to 10 minutes up to one hour, to
0.4 parts per million of sulfur dioxide or more.''
   But it said ``these response occurred predominantly in subjects
who were exercising and not using preventive medication at the
time.''
   It added that the effects ``appear to be transient and
reversible and, at lower concentrations, are similar to those most
asthmatics typically experience from exercise or other stimuli, for
example, cold air.''
   These effects are not like an ``asthma attack,'' and asthmatics
on medication ``will likely not experience a response'' to a
short-term peak, the agency said.
   Doniger said: ``I don't know of any responsible group of
scientists that takes that position. The (agency) argument is, just
because there are other things that make asthmatics ill, it's OK
for power plants to make asthmatics ill.''
   Only about 1 percent of the national population of asthmatics,
estimated by the American Lung Association as 30 million people,
would be exposed to short-term peaks, EPA said.

   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan urged
cheering students at the University of Pennsylvania to support
Jesse Jackson for president. Outside, other students protested
Farrakhan's on-campus lecture.
   ``Jackson is running to save a people, he is running to save the
nation,'' said Farrakhan, who endorsed the Chicago minister four
years ago and campaigned with him. Farrakhan has not been involved
in the 1988 Jackson campaign.
   ``I don't care if he (Jackson) rejects me,'' said Farrakhan who
told reporters at an earlier news conference Wednesday the
Democratic contender ``does not want my help, nor needs my
support.''
   ``America is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black
skins,'' Farrakhan told the mixed black and white crowd of 2,000,
most of whom stood and applauded. ``You should thank God Jesse
Jackson has emerged.''
   Jackson accepted Farrakhan's endorsement in 1984 and refused to
denounce some of Farrakhan's anti-white, anti-Jewish statements.
Farrakhan was quoted as praising Adolf Hitler and calling Judaism a
``gutter religion.''
   The counter-demonstration on the sidewalks outside Penn's Irvine
Auditorium attracted a crowd which police estimated at 1,000 but
which university leaders said was no more than 400.
   It preceded a memorial service held nearby commemorating the
Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were exterminated during World
War II by Hitler's Nazis.
   At the anti-Farrakhan rally, speakers denounced the Muslim
leader for what they said was his anti-Semitic, anti-white rhetoric
and called on students to denounce the remarks.
   Students held signs saying: ``Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No.''
and ``Free Speech, Yes. Hatred, No.''
   ``No matter what Farrahkan says, it doesn't erase what he said
in the past,'' said Daniel Gemulka, the rally organizer and
chairman of the Council of Jewish Students. ``We must work together
as a community instead of being at odds.''
   Last week, university officials refused a Jewish group's request
to cancel the visit, saying they respected Farrakhan's right to
free speech. A letter condemning Farrakhan and signed by more than
700 students and teachers appeared in the student paper Wednesday.
   University President Sheldon Hackney defended the Farrakhan
visit, insisting that ``in an academic community, open expression
is the most fundamental value. We can't have free speech just some
of the time for some of the people.''
   Farrakhan spoke for more than two hours. He called America ``a
racist, white society.'' He claimed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
was assassinated ``with the express consent of the U.S.
government.''
   ``How can I ask black people to fight for this country that
don't give a damn for us?'' he asked. Cheers roared from a crowd of
2,000 who had to pass through electronic metal detectors to enter
the auditorium. The university spent about $6,000 in additional
security for the lecture.
   He predicted that ``in less than 100 years blacks will equal the
number of whites in America and we won't have to ask, `Will there
be a black in the White House?'''
   He also denied he was an anti-Semite, had denigrated Judaism, or
had boasted about the greatness of Hitler, despite his negative
comments about Jews in the past and during the speech.
   It was these charges, he said, that Jews are repeating in New
York, which will hold a presidential primary next week.
   ``They are using me in New York to try to derail Jackson,''
Farrakhan said.
   Farrakhan was paid $10,000 plus travel expenses by the two
groups sponsoring the appearance: the Organization of Black
Consciousness and the predominantly white Penn Political Union.

<HEAD>Warm March Saves $450 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans saved $450 million on their heating
bills last month thanks to warmer-than-normal weather over most of
the nation, the government reported today.
   That means that a typical homeowner paid $88.46 to keep warm
during the month, $6.26 less than would have been expected in
normal March weather, according to figures compiled by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Savings peaked in the Pacific Coast states, where the average
home heating bill of $54.28 was $9.52 below normal. The average
bill of $54.79 in the west south central states was just about
normal for the month.
   Here is a regional rundown of March heating costs for a typical
household and the comparison to costs in normal March weather.
   _Middle Atlantic: $126.98, or $8.73 below normal. Includes New
York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   _New England: $114.63, or $4.88 below normal. Includes Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
   _East North Central: $103.65, or $5.84 below normal. Includes
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   _East South Central: $86.84, or $2.63 below normal. Includes
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama.

   Palestinians staged a general strike across the
occupied territories today to protest mass arrests of Arabs.
Hospital officials said one Arab protester was killed and two
wounded in clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   The strike, ordered by the PLO-affiliated underground
leadership, was to support 4,800 Palestinians detained by Israeli
troops since an Arab uprising was launched last December.
   Most of the 110,000 Palestinians with jobs in Israel didn't show
up for work. Arab shopowners closed their doors in the cities of
Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, Hebron, Jerusalem and Gaza.
   Since Dec. 8, 144 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed
in anti-occupation unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
according to U.N. figures.
   Protests broke out today in two refugee camps in the Gaza Strip
and two cities in the West Bank, according to Arab media reports.
   Wael Hassan Asmar, 24, was shot in the heart and died at Al
Ittihad Hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus, an emergency room
official told The Associated Press.
   The two wounded were identified as 12-year-old Mohammed Fuad
Taha, who lost his right eye after being hit by a rubber bullet in
Tulkarem, and Rebhi Shihada Rehan, 17, who was in critical conditon
with a bullet wound in the stomach, said an official at Rafidiyeh
Hospital in Nablus.
   The army denied allegations that soldiers were using tear gas
improperly against Palestinians or using a particularly toxic form
of the gas.
   ``There is absolutely no truth to the report we are using a new
type of toxic gas. The Israeli army does not use any toxic gases in
dealing with Palestinian demonstrators,'' said an army spokesman,
who in keeping with regulations, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Dr. John Hiddlestone, director of health affairs for the U.N.
Relief Works Agency, said today that Palestinians are suffering
abdominal pain, miscarriages and muscular weakness from tear gas.
He said the symptoms are not usually associated with the gas.
   The director of Israel's Government Press Office, Yoram
Ettinger, said he plans to bar Palestinians from distributing press
releases to foreign journalists in their mailboxes at the press
office.
   ``Being committed to the PLO they shouldn't expect Israel, whom
the PLO wants to destroy, to facilitate their dissemination of
information,'' Ettinger told the English-language Jerusalem Post
daily.
   Ettinger's plans were protested by the Foreign Press Association.
   On Wednesday, soldiers arrested 70 Palestinians in a raid on the
West Bank village of Salfit, whose residents had rejected Israeli
authority and set up their own government, Israeli media reported.
   Salfit, 20 miles north of Jerusalem, became a symbol of an
organized liberated town, a model of quiet civil disobedience,
Israeli media reports said, and the army feared the model would be
adopted by other communities.
   The village was headed by a committee of Communist Party members
and representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
Fatah branch that had provided community services for 6,000
residents and created a system of guards, Israel Television said.
Residents were barred from painting anti-Israeli slogans or
erecting roadblocks.
   Israeli media reported as many as 70 people were arrested. The
army put the number of detainees at ``several dozen.'' The
television showed many of the men, blindfolded with white rags,
sitting on the ground on a village street.
   At the Lebanese border, troops killed three Palestinian
guerrillas who tried to enter Israel before dawn on Wednesday on a
hostage-taking mission.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers wounded 53 Arabs in a refugee camp
with metal bullets, rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings, U.N. and
hospital officials said.
   On Wednesday, Arab activists punished Palestinian merchants
defying PLO orders to open their stores only for three hours in the
morning. The activists firebombed a money-changer's shop in east
Jerusalem and set fire to stalls at a produce market in Bethlehem,
police and witnesses said.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rose 0.1 Percent in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent
in February, much slower than the pace in recent months, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gain in inventories pushed them
up by $825 million during February to a seasonally adjusted $715.9
billion. The inventory gan came as total business sales were
climbing 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $468.3 billion in
February, reversing a 0.5 percent decline in January.
   The February gain in inventories held on shelves and backlots
followed a 0.7 percent gain in January. The February rise was held
back by a 1.1 percent fall in inventories held by retailers.
   This decrease reflected primarily a 5.2 percent drop in the
backlog of unsold cars.
   Analysts had worried that the rise in unsold inventories late in
1987 and in January would force production cutbacks and weak
economic growth in the early part of 1988.
   But recently economists have modified their views, contending
that the slowdown in growth in the early part of this year will not
be as severe as they had first feared.
   The 1.1 percent decline in inventories held at the retail level
was accompanied by increases of 0.9 percent in inventories held at
the wholesale level and 0.5 percent in inventories held by
manufacturers.
   The 0.6 percent overall sales rise was led by a 1.2 percent
increase in wholesale sales in February, a 0.6 percent rise in
sales by retailers and a 0.1 percent rise in sales by manufacturers.
   In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail
sales increased 0.8 percent in March.
   The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to
1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust
inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not
considered abnormally high.

   The developers of a drug used to lower
cholesterol were named ``Inventors of the Year'' today by
Intellectual Property Owners Inc.
   Selected for the honor were Alfred W. Alberts, Georg
Albers-Schonberg, Richard L. Monaghan and the late Carl H. Hoffman,
who developed the drug Mevacor.
   The four were part of a research team at Merck Sharp & Dohme
Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., said the association, a
non-profit group which represents people who hold patents,
trademarks and copyrights.
   Mevacor, also known as lovastatin, was one of the first of a new
class of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use
in lowering cholesterol levels. High cholesterol has been
associated with heart disease.
   The Inventor of the Year Award carries a $4,000 cash prize.
   In addition, the IPO honored five other people as
``Distinguished Inventors of 1988.'' They are:
   _Elbert L. ``Burt`` Rutan of Mojave, Calif., for development of
high performance aircraft. Rutan designed the aircraft Voyager,
which circled the globe nonstop in 1986.
   _Janine Jagger of the University of Virginia Medical School for
invention of a retractable safety needle, which could help prevent
the spread of disease by eliminating the danger of medical workers
accidentally being stuck by needles.
   _Charles L. Dumoulin and Christopher J. Hardy, General Electric
researchers in Schenectady, N.Y., who developed a magnetic
resonance technique that can help physicians monitor heart patients.
   _James J. Duffy of Ford Motor Co. for a variable assist power
steering mechanism.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said
today that he foresees more bloodshed in Afghanistan because an
accord to end Soviet military involvement there does not address
the issue of a new Afghan government.
   Zia said that as long as the Kabul government remains in power
and the guerrillas fight to overthrow it, the war will continue and
an estimated 5 million Afghan refugees will not be able to return
home safely.
   ``I see trouble and turmoil in Afghanistan through the
insurgency, through the Mujahedeen trying to achieve their
objective to overthrow this regime and establish their own
authority, and that will mean more loss of life,'' Zia told
reporters at an informal news briefing.
   ``That will mean insurgency in Afghanistan will not stop unless
the Afghan Mujahedeen have achieved their end.''
   When asked why Pakistan agreed to sign the accord in Geneva
today, Zia cited the provision calling for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops backing the Kabul government. Pakistan, which borders
Afghanistan and hosts about 3 million of the 5 million Afghan
refugees, represented the rebels in the talks.
   He said the withdrawal ``made the task of the Mujahedeen less
strenuous,'' implying that it would be easier for the guerrillas to
overthrow the communist regime.
   ``Once they're (Soviets) withdrawn, the logical conclusion ...
(is) that it will be a little difficult for the present regime to
stand for a longer period,'' Zia said.
   The accord signed in Geneva does not guarantee the end of the
10-year-old war in Afghanistan, but it calls for the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops to begin leaving the country by May 15.
   It does not address the issue of an interim government to
replace the one in power now. The guerrillas have said they will
continue fighting until the government is deposed.
   In addition to Pakistan, the United States, Soviet Union and
Afghanistan signed the agreement.
   The civil war began 10 years ago after a communist coup
installed a government friendly to the Soviet Union. Red Army
troops intervened in December 1979.

<TEXT>
   A fierce northeaster pounded the mid-Atlantic coast with heavy
rains, winds near hurricane strength and waves that covered
highways, toppled at least two houses into the sea and threatened
the only bridge to Hatteras Island.
   The storm bore down hardest on North Carolina, where whipped sea
foam covered beaches like a blanket of snow. Winds gusted up to 70
mph and waves crested at nearly 25 feet off Cape Hatteras. No
serious injuries were reported.
   Forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would linger off
the coast, meteorologist Harry Gordon at the National Weather
Service's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., said
today.
   In Sandbridge, Va., Dick Schumacher said his $200,000 oceanfront
home tumbled into the surf, and officials said about 20 other homes
were threatened by high water and pounding surf.
   ``My house is in the ocean. It's finished,'' Schumacher said
Wednesday night. ``I'm heartsick.''
   About 5,000 people, mostly in Virginia Beach, temporarily lost
electricity in the storm, which also tore up roads and washed out
trees, road signs and utility poles and toppled portions of at
least four houses. Tides rose to their highest level in six years,
officials said.
   By this morning, the storm was far enough off the coast for
winds to die down, and residents began cleaning up the tons of
debris from their scoured beaches.
   The northeaster, which takes its name from the prevailing wind
direction during the storm, pushes tides to abnormal heights,
eroding beaches and turning storm drains into geysers.
   ``The wind literally forces the water up against the coast,''
said Terry Ritter, meteorologist in charge of the Norfolk office of
the National Weather Service.
   Flood warnings also were issued for the Delaware and Maryland
coasts.
   In Ocean City, Md., police reported minor flooding. Police
spokesman Jay Hancock said the water was very high, and it was
difficult to say how much beach has eroded until the water goes
down. No beachfront properties were damaged, however.
   At least one cottage in North Carolina fell into the ocean, and
state Highway 12 was closed late Wednesday, stranding some Outer
Banks residents in the town of Manteo overnight, said T.C.
McKimmey, of the Dare County Sheriff's Department.
   ``The cottage already had suffered severe erosion and had been
leaning last spring, but the storm took the final toll,'' McKimmey
said. Several other houses also were threatened by waters that
rolled over the beach road in Nags Head.
   Heavy surf washed away about 100 feet of sand from the south
side of Oregon Inlet, threatening to damage the approach to the
Herbert C. Bonner Bridge that leads to Hatteras Island, about 20
miles off the North Carolina coast.
   Further erosion could wash away much of the sand from South
Point, exposing the bridge and approach to direct waves, highway
officials said.
   ``That point is the protection for our south bridge abutment,''
state Highway Administrator George Wells said. ``The ocean is
eating away rapidly at that point.''
   Aides said Gov. Jim Martin planned to fly to the coast today
with highway officials to survey the damage.
   At Carolina Beach, N.C., heavy rain and wind caused erosion
almost as fast as a dredge pumped sand in a $1.4 million beach
replenishment project.
   ``We're losing sand fast due to this inclement weather,'' Town
Manager David Serrell said. ``It happened almost overnight, but
there's nothing you can do about it. I don't know how much is being
lost in dollar figures.''
   In Virginia, the Downtown Tunnel between Norfolk and Portsmouth
was closed for three hours Wednesday as water in the tube rose as
high as 7 inches. The flooding was caused by water that poured into
an electrical junction box left uncapped by construction workers,
state Transportation Department spokesman John Hanke said.
   ``It was a combination of freak occurrences that will never
happen again in a million years,'' Hanke said.

   A terrorism task force is investigating
a Japanese national arrested on the New Jersey Turnpike with three
homemade bombs, each powerful enough to destroy a building,
authorities said.
   The suspect was identified by Tokyo police today as Yu Kikumura,
35, a former bookstore owner who was extradited to Japan by the
Netherlands two years ago on charges of illegal possession of
explosives.
   In Tokyo, acting Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi
said the National Police Agency ``has a strong suspicion that he
(Kikumura) might have a relationship with the Japan Red Army,'' a
terrorist group that gained notoriety for a series of attacks
abroad in the 1970s.
   However, Japanese police ``haven't made a final conclusion that
he is a member of the Red Army,'' Haraguchi told a news conference.
   Kyodo news service in Tokyo said Kikumura's arrest had raised
suspicions the Red Army might be planning attacks during the summit
of leaders of advanced industrial nations June 19 in Toronto,
Canada.
   The task force was formed by state police and FBI agents in
response to concerns about the sophistication of the bombs found in
the suspect's car, and ``inquiries from overseas,'' state police
Superintendent Clinton Pagano said at a news conference Wednesday.
   ``The material was loaded and charged and ready to use,'' Pagano
said. ``It was intended to injure people.''
   Kikumura was arrested Tuesday at a Turnpike rest stop after a
state trooper noticed him acting oddly, stopped his car and found
explosive devices and three homemade bombs resembling fire
extinguishers in his car.
   The suspect was carrying a stolen Japanese passport and
international driver's license. The man named on the passport and
license, Masatoshi Kishizono, had reported his passport was
missing, Pagano said.
   Kikumura was charged with possession of explosive devices and
possession of explosives. State police experts who defused the
bombs say each of the devices contained enough power to destroy a
building.
   A bail hearing was scheduled this afternoon in Superior Court
for the suspect, who was being held at the Bergen County Jail.
   Pagano and John C. McGinley, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Newark office, told the news conference they would not
speculate on where the suspect was headed or what he planned to do
with the bombs.
   During a hearing Wednesday, Bergen County Assistant Prosecutor
Paula Dumas told Judge Charles R. DiGisi that authorities were
unable to identify the suspect.
   The address he had given U.S. immigration officials upon
entering the country May 8, 1987, turned out to be that of an
unoccupied New York City apartment, police said.
   Also, the man had indicated he did not understand questions
posed in English, although he had spoken in clear English to the
trooper who arrested him, Ms. Dumas said.
   Japanese police said Kikumura, a dropout of Tokyo University of
Foreign Studies, was deported to Tokyo by the Netherlands in August
1986, three months after police at a local airport found 2.2 pounds
of dynamite in his luggage.
   He was acquitted of the Dutch charges in a Japanese court later
in 1986 and dropped out of sight, police said.
   The Japanese police spokesman refused comment on news reports
that authorities believed Kikumura established links to the Red
Army, a Japanese terrorist group, in 1974 when he ran a bookshop in
Athens, Greece.
   The Red Army was a radical splinter faction of the leftist
General Federation of Japanese Students, which claimed support from
850,000 of the nation's 1.3 million college students in the 1960s.
   After gaining notoriety from a series of terrorist activities
abroad in the 1970s, including the attack on Israel's Ben-Gurion
International Airport in which 28 people were killed, the Red Army
has been relatively silent in recent years.

<HEAD>`Colors' Director, Producer Defend Gang Film As Protest Mounts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Dennis Hopper defended his new film
``Colors,'' a gritty street-gang drama, as a story told from a
police viewpoint, while a downtown theater scratched the movie for
fear it would spark violence.
   The film, scheduled for release Friday, used active Los Angeles
gang members as extras and advisers as well as the actual
identifying colors of blue for the Crips and red for the Bloods
gangs.
   ``Colors'' has drawn criticism from police, city officials and
community leaders who claim it glorifies the violent youth gangs
that have been plaguing the city.
   Outside a private, celebrity screening Wednesday night, 10
Guardian Angels chanted ``Don't Show `Colors''' while Hopper
defended the film starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall as
gang-fighting police officers.
   The Guardian Angels claims that ``Colors'' glamorizes the
street-gang lifestyle and wants distribution of the film halted or
some of its proceeds donated to community organizations that combat
gang violence.
   ``There is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a
gang,'' Hopper said, adding that the film is told from a police
viewpoint. ``I don't know how people can twist it around and say
I'm glorifying gangs.''
   At the celebrity screening, the movie's producer, Robert H.
Solo, called the protests misguided.
   ``I think the people who are making those predictions are
whipping up the probability and the possibility,'' of violence, the
producer said. ``The people who are saying blood is going to flow
in the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets. I think
it's very irresponsible behavior.''
   Attending the VIP screening were Best Actress Oscar-winner Cher,
and last year's winner Marlee Matlin, Richard Dean Anderson of
ABC-TV's ``McGyver,'' U-2's Bono Hewson and actor-director Emilio
Estevez.
   The downtown Laemmle Grand, adjoining the posh Sheraton Grand
Hotel, decided not to show the film because its staff feared a
reaction from nearby gangs.
   ``The staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf
of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from
downtown,'' said Bob Laemmle, co-owner of the theater chain.
   About 70 theaters in the Los Angeles area plan to show the movie.
   The Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter of the National Assocition
for the Advancement of Colored People joined police and city
leaders who objected to the film premiering in Los Angeles during a
period of heightened public concern about gang violence.
   More than 85 people have been killed so far this year in
gang-related violence in Los Angeles County. Last year, there were
387 gang-related killings.

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino of
the Philippines today burned incense at her ancestral temple and
bowed three times in front of her ancestral tablets.
   Mrs. Aquino, making her first trip abroad since going to Japan
in November 1986, left behind a nation on full military alert amid
concerns of a coup attempt during her absence.
   Later, on the first day of a three-day trip to China, Mrs.
Aquino traveled to Beijing.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said everyone on the
presidential plane was very upbeat and there was no talk of dangers
posed by the escape of former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan,
leader of a bloody coup last Aug. 28.
   ``Mr. Honasan has lost all capability of mounting any serious
threat on the government,'' Benigno said. ``If there was any
question about that, then the president would have wavered in her
decision to come to China, but not for one minute did she waver in
her plans.''
   Manila was quiet today with no signs of trouble.
   The president, accompanied by seven Cabinet ministers, was
greeted in Beijing by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing and taken
to the Diaoyutai state guest house where she will stay during her
three-day visit to China. Three of her four daughters also are
making the trip.
   On Friday, Mrs. Aquino will be officially welcomed by new
President Yang Shangkun outside the Great Hall of the People and
will hold talks with Premier Li Peng. She is also to sign a trade
protocol and a science and technology agreement.
   China stopped supporting communist rebels in the Philippines
after Beijing and Manila established full diplomatic relations in
the mid-1970s. Mrs. Aquino is the first Philippines leader to visit
China since Ferdinand Marcos in 1975.
   The high point of Mrs. Aquino's first day in China was a visit
to Hongjian, a village of 2,800 in coastal Fujian province that was
home to her maternal great-grandfather, Xu Yuhuan. Xu settled in
the Philippines in 1861 and changed his name to Cojuangco, Mrs.
Aquino's maiden name.
   More than half the residents of Hongjian are surnamed Xu.
   Mrs. Aquino and her entourage left for the one-hour drive to
Hongjian immediately after arriving by special flight in Xiamen.
Crowds lined the roads passing through fertile, terraced farmland.
   At Hongjian, residents waved yellow banners and Chinese and
Philippine flags, and set off firecrackers while a school band
played.
   At the Xu family ancestral temple, which had been restored and
painted for the visit, Mrs. Aquino burned incense and bowed three
times before memorial tablets.
   ``I came to China for reasons of state and for reasons personal
to me, for I am both head of state of my country and a daughter of
this village.'' she said in English.
   She ended the speech by saying in Chinese, ``I and my daughters
and my colleagues again thank you for your welcome, which we will
never forget.'
   Mrs. Aquino visited a kindergarten, where she gave yellow ``Cory
Aquino'' t-shirts to the children and looked at family photos in
the home of an uncle, Xu Yuanxiang.
   Some villagers expressed regret that her one-hour visit was so
brief. Her contacts with the 49 relatives was limited mainly to
handshakes just before her departure.

   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan urged
cheering students at the University of Pennsylvania to support
Jesse Jackson for president. But others outside protested
Farrakhan's on-campus lecture.
   ``Jackson is running to save a people; he is running to save the
nation,'' Farrakhan said Wednesday night.
   He campaigned with Jackson four years ago, but became a focus of
controversy for what were widely considered anti-Jewish statements.
He has been quoted as calling Adolf Hitler a great man and Judaism
``a gutter religion.''
   Jackson has distanced himself from his former ally since then.
   ``I don't care if he rejects me,'' said Farrakhan who told
reporters at an earlier news conference Wednesday the Democratic
contender ``does not want my help, nor need my support.''
   ``America is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black
skins,'' Farrakhan told the mixed black and white crowd of 2,000,
most of whom stood and applauded. ``You should thank God Jesse
Jackson has emerged.''
   He denied he was an anti-Semite, had denigrated Judaism, or had
boasted about the greatness of Hitler. He said Jews are repeating
those charges in New York, which has its presidential primary next
Tuesday.
   ``They are using me in New York to try to derail Jackson,''
Farrakhan said.
   A counter-demonstration on the sidewalks outside the
university's Irvine Auditorium attracted a crowd which police
estimated at 1,000 but which university leaders said was about 400.
   Speakers at the rally denounced Farrakhan for what they said was
his anti-Semitic, anti-white rhetoric. Students held signs saying:
``Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No'' and ``Free Speech, Yes. Hatred,
No.''
   University President Sheldon Hackney defended the Farrakhan
visit, saying that ``in an academic community, open expression is
the most fundamental value. We can't have free speech just some of
the time for some of the people.''
   Farrakhan, in a speech lasting more than two hours, called
America ``a racist, white society.'' He contended the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. was assassinated ``with the express consent of the
U.S. government.''
   ``How can I ask black people to fight for this country that
don't give a damn for us?'' he asked. The crowd cheered.
   He predicted that ``in less than 100 years blacks will equal the
number of whites in America and we won't have to ask, `Will there
be a black in the White House?'''

<HEAD>Republicans Launch Offensive Against Income-Tax Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of House Republicans today used the
approaching tax-filing deadline as the occasion to launch an
offensive aimed at blocking income-tax increases and requiring a
balanced budget.
   ``The Democratic leadership of the House is systematically
denying the American people a vote on the balanced-budget
amendment'' to the Constitution, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told a
news conference.
   He and several GOP colleagues joined representatives of several
lobbying groups to press for support for:
   _A promise to oppose increases in tax rates or any further cuts
in deductions unless accompanied by rate reductions. Seventy-eight
House Republicans have signed the vow.
   _A petition that would force the Judiciary Committee to allow a
vote on a measure that eventually could amend the Constitution to
prohibit the government from spending more than it takes in. Rep.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a sponsor of the proposal, said the petition
has 190 of the required 218 signatures.
   _A ``taxpayer bill of rights'' requiring the Internal Revenue
Service to give 30-day notice before seizing property. The
legislation, recently approved by the Senate Finance Committee,
also seeks to protect taxpayers in other ways in dealing with the
IRS.
   _A bill by Rep. Joe DioGuardi, R-N.Y., that would require the
IRS to send taxpayers an annual statement indicating their
``share'' of federal spending and debt.
   The Republican efforts were endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, National Taxpayers Union, Citizens for a Sound Economy,
and Free the Eagle, a conservative lobbying organization.

<TEXT>
   Panama's military rejected a report
that U.S. soldiers engaged up to 50 intruders in a two-hour
firefight at a fuel depot.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo of the Panamanian Defense Forces
told reporters Wednesday night the U.S. Marine sentries had
``confused the swaying of tropical palm trees with non-existent
enemies.''
   He also accused the Marines of moving 100 yards into Panamanian
territory during the incident and called it the ``24th Gringo
military invasion of Panamanian soil.''
   The U.S. Southern Command said about 100 Marines were involved
in a firefight with 40 to 50 ``unauthorized personnel'' first
spotted at dusk Tuesday at the 800-acre Arraijan Tank Farm, an
underground fuel depot near Howard Air Force Base outside Panama
City. There apparently were no injuries on either side, said U.S.
spokesman Col. Ron Sconyers.
   He said Marines who swept the area after daylight found no
evidence of injuries and no equipment any intruders might have left
behind.
   Sconyers, the chief spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command,
said Marines today were investigating the area where the alleged
shooting took place and that he hoped to be able to supply physical
evidence of an intrusion and firefight.
   On Monday, a Marine sentry was shot to death during an attempted
break-in at the depot by six to eight people dressed in camouflage,
U.S. military officials said. He was apparently shot accidentally
by another Marine.
   Sconyers said there was no evidence in either incident that the
intruders were Panamanian military personnel, but said that on
Tuesday they all were ``reported wearing dark uniforms.''

<HEAD>Food Stamp Crackdown Produces 11 Arrests in Missouri</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crackdown on illegal use of food stamps has
produced 11 arrests in southeast Missouri and indications that more
can be expected, the Agriculture Department says.
   The arrests began Tuesday but were not announced here until late
Wednesday to allow the completion of undercover investigations,
according to USDA's inspector general, Robert W. Beuley.
   Charges included buying food stamps for cash, exchanging
property for food stamps, and mail theft, he said.
   Undercover agents said they exchanged about $75,000 in food
stamps for stolen weapons, sawed-off shotguns, narcotics, liquor, a
late-model pickup truck, prescriptions for narcotics, and $20,000
in cash.
   Beuley said that during the investigation agents also uncovered
information that aided local law enforcement authorities in a
drug-related homicide and the recovery of a substantial amount of
marijuana.
   He said those arrested included: Emma Hempstead, Egson, age not
disclosed, Cape Girardeau; Robert Christopher Franck, 45, owner,
Doniphan Recreation Center, Doniphan; and Lois Kirkland, 53, owner,
Discount Furniture, Kennett.
   Also arrested, all of Sikeston: Moses E. Boyd, 33,; Granville
Goodman, 31; Jerry W. Helmes, 46; Robert Johnson, 40; Earl Gene
Lott, 40; John Leroy Marks, 50; Jeffrey Lyn Triplett, 24; and Lloyd
Gene Washington, 20.
   Beuley said the investigation was conducted with the help of the
Sikeston and Cape Girardeau police departments; the Ripley County
and Duklin County sheriff's offices; and federal agents from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
   The Missouri Highway Patrol assisted with the arrests, and the
investigation was coordinated by Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy
Wilson, St. Louis, Mo., he said.

<HEAD>Space Station Completion Will Be Delayed One Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA gave a bad news-good news report to
Congress today on the impact of money cutbacks for building a U.S.
space station: completion will be delayed one year, but a robot
laboratory on the station will be in operation earlier than planned.
   ``The realities of the federal budget environment are clear,''
James C. Fletcher, administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, wrote to the chairmen of the House and Senate
Committees that oversee the space agency.
   NASA had asked for $767 million for the space station in the
current fiscal year but received $425 million. The agency wanted
$1.8 billion in the year that begins next Oct. 1, but the
president's budget proposal would give it $1 billion.
   In letters to Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., and Sen. William
Proxmire, R-Wis., Fletcher said that left the agency three options:
cutting down on the station, changing the way the program is
managed or stretching out the time to build the station.
   Fletcher said the third approach ``is the only sensible way''
since more than four years and $600 million already have gone into
planning the station configuration and because the program
management is solid and is producing results.
   Under the schedule he outlined, the first flight ferrying
building materials for the station into space will be early in
1995, a year later than planned. It would be completed in late 1996.
   The fourth flight, rather than the sixth, will carry aloft a
laboratory that can be ``man-tended'' _ visited and serviced
periodically by astronauts.
   ``This approach basically involves a reordering of the assembly
sequence leading towards this nation's goal in the mid-1990s _ a
permanent presence in space,'' Fletcher wrote.
   Originally, the plans had been to have the station up and
running in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of
America.
   Fletcher said the new assembly sequence delays the bulk of
attached sicence payloads until later in the construction sequence.
It will take 16 flights to have the full station in operation and
11 flights before crews can be housed on the station.

<TEXT>
   Police today charged a 50-year-old man
with murdering his young son, who vanished 25 years ago but whose
remains weren't discovered until last week.
   William Leonard Jennings sobbed loudly as he appeared in a
magistrates court in West Yorkshire and was charged with killing
his 3-year-old son, Stephen, who was last seen alive on Dec. 12,
1962.
   Jennings, handcuffed to a plainclothes policeman, wept
throughout the 70-minute court hearing. The judge denied bail and
ordered him to remain in custody until another court appearance
next week.
   Police arrested Jennings on Wednesday after a dog found
Stephen's skull and bones under a stone near a footpath less than a
half a mile from the boy's home.
   Forensic scientists confirmed the bones were Stephen's but have
not disclosed the cause of death.
   Stephen disappeared after setting off on a cold winter morning
from his home in Little Gomersal, near Bradford in northern
England, to follow his 4-year-old brother, Paul, who was visiting
an aunt.
   Despite a massive search, police found no clues to the boy's
disappearance until the bones turned up.

   The United States and the Soviet Union today
signed an accord to end Moscow's intervention in Afghnistan and
allow the Red Army to start pulling out its 115,000 troops on May
15.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan also signed the agreement in a solemnm
10-minute ceremony in a marble and gold council chamber at U.N.
headquarters. Pakistan was representing the Afghan guerrillas, who
have vowed to continue their war to oust the Marxist government in
Kabul.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who signed for the United
States, said the agreement would allow the people of Afghanistan to
determine their own future and to restore the independence they
have earned through ``blood and sacrifice.'' Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed for the Soviet Union.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations
said the U.N.-mediated agreements ``represent a major stride in the
effort to bring peace to Afghanistan.''
   Also signing the accord were Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of
Afghanistan and Acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani of Pakistan.
   Shultz said the United States will continue to aid the Afghan
guerrillas until the Soviets stop arming the Afghan government. But
he also said the agreement will ``improve the atmosphere'' of
U.S.-Soviet relations and could help end Soviet intervention in
other regional conflicts.
   The settlement followed six years of on-again, off-again
negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which neighbors
Afghanistan and is home to an estimated 3 million Afghan refugees.
   The Moslem insurgents fighting the Marxist Afghan government for
10 years have headquarters in Pakistan. Pakistan also serves as the
conduit for foreign military aid to the guerrillas.
   Perez de Cuellar opened the 10-minute ceremony by thanking
Afghanistan and Pakistan for their ``tireless efforts.'' He thanked
the United States, which supports the guerrillas, and the Soviet
Union, which backs the government, for agreeing to guarantee the
accord.
   Aides carried the leather-bound documents from one minister to
the next for signing. Copies go to each country and the United
Nations.
   The agreement commits Pakistan and Afghanistan to not support
``directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist activities''
against each other, and it provides from the withdrawal of Soviet
troops who entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the government.
   Shultz said he was confident the Soviet Union would begin its
troop withdrawal on schedule May 15.
   But in Pakistan, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said today he
foresees continued turmoil in Afghanistan because the agreement
doesn't address the issue of a new government to replace the one
headed by President Najib.
   There is no provision in accord to end the war, and it says
nothing about the composition of future Afghan governments.
   Pakistan said it would continue to withhold recognition of the
Kabul government pending formation of a new one. In a letter to
Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator in the talks, Noorani said that
``in view of the realities of the situation in Afghanistan and
notwithstanding the accords signed today, (Pakistan) will continue
to ... withhold extending recognition to the regime in Kabul.''
   The Afghan guerrillas have said they will continue their war
until the government is deposed. No guerrilla leaders attended the
signing ceremony.
   Shultz and Perez de Cuellar stressed that the accord will let
the Afghan people determine their fate.
   ``The challenge facing the Afghan people is great, but it can
and must be met by them alone,'' the secretary-general said.
   ``Through their blood and sacrifice, the Afghans have earned the
opportunity to resume their independence,'' Shultz said. ``Let us
help them realize it.''
   The United Nations estimates 1.5 million Afghans have been
killed in the war, which began after an April 1978 communist coup.
More than 10,000 Soviets have died in the fighting, Western sources
estimate.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told American business
leaders in Moscow on Wednesday that the accord may have
international implications on a par with the superpower treaty
signed in December to ban medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The Afghan agreement provides for withdrawal of all Soviet
troops, pledges by Pakistan and Afghanistan of non-interference in
each other's affairs, and the safe return of about 5 million
refugees from Pakistan and Iran. Moscow and Washington will
guarantee Afghanistan's future non-alignment and the United Nations
will supervise the settlement, including the return of refugees.
   Cordovez will continue promoting an intra-Afghan settlement by
shuttling between the fighters and the government in Kabul.
   Another point left out of the accord is military aid.
   An informal understanding has been reported between the Soviet
Union and United States. Diplomatic sources say each superpower
will phase out such aid, while reserving the right to resume it if
the other side does.

<HEAD>Heckling Fans Disrupt Performance At La Scala Opera House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opera fans apparently angered by the
withdrawal of star tenor Luciano Pavarotti disrupted La Scala's
season premiere of ``Elisir d'Amore'' with whistles and shouts at
some of the principals.
   Most of Wednesday night's heckling was aimed at Welsh singer
Marie McLaughlin and Syrian-born Italian director Andree Ruth
Shammah.
   One fan shouted ``You are an amateur!'' at McLaughlin, and a
deluge of whistles and shouts of ``Buffoon!'' greeted Shammah when
she appeared on stage at the end of the performance. Milan's daily
newspaper Corriere della Sera called her direction
``untraditional.''
   Conductor Giuseppe Patane also got his share of heckling.
Differences between Pavarotti and the conductor reportedly erupted
during rehearsals last week but La Scala officials said Pavarotti
dropped out because of a cold.
   Pavarotti's substitute, Vincenzo La Scola, received tepid
applause.
   ``He worked hard to make up for the absence of Pavarotti but his
personal success did not save the performance,'' Corriere della
Sera said.

<TEXT>
   April in Paris is supposed to smell of blossoms and
perfume, but for residents in some neighborhoods, it reeked of
rotten eggs.
   Fire department officials said Thursday that for the second time
in a week, they had received telephone calls inquiring into the
source of the unpleasant odor that greeted them when they woke up
Wednesday.
   Officials said they did not know where the smell was coming
from, but that it posed no health hazard.
   The stench permeated three southern Paris neighborhoods and
suburban areas.
   ``People start to worry when they leave their own neighborhoods
and find the same awful smell in other parts of the city,'' said
the official, who declined to be identified in keeping with
departmental policy.
   The spokesman said the fire department had received about a
dozen complaints. He said pollution levels were normal and that
there was no evidence a toxic substance had leaked over the city.
   ``No industrial facilities warned of spills,'' he said.
   The smells could not be identified, he said, because ``smells
are very subjective and different people smelled different things.''

<HEAD>Ukrainian Crop Yields Increase, Despite Chernobyl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop yields in the Soviet Ukraine have increased
despite the Chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago, Tass reported
Thursday.
   The official news agency said the April 26, 1986, disaster
caused no ``irreparable damage'' to the region's agriculture.
Chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   In the seven months after a blast and fire split open one of
Chernobyl's reactors, 31 people died. Thousands were exposed to
dangerous levels of radiation.
   There were concerns that the agriculture of the Ukraine,
traditionally one of the breadbasket regions of the Soviet Union,
might suffer from the release of radiation.
   Tass quoted Alexei Denisenko, deputy chairman of the state
agro-industrial committee of the Ukraine, as saying all farm
products within the Chernobyl area are checked for radiation and
pronounced safe before they are sold.
   He said grain yields per hectare in the Kiev region, which
includes Chernobyl, were up by 31 percent in 1987 as compared with
the previous year. Such increases are not believed linked to
mutations in plants that might be caused by radiation, he said.
   ``Crop rises are attributed only to introduction of intensive
technologies of cultivation, as well as to intrduction of contract
forms of labor organization,'' Denisenko told Tass.
   Denisenko said the type of crops grown at some farms were
switched on the recommendation of scientists. For instance, farms
which had been growing vegetables now are planted in grain and
potatoes which do not accumulate radioactive decay products, Tass
said.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Moral Majority
helped elect President Reagan in 1980, said today he does not
believe the American people are ready to put religious leaders such
as Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson in the White House.
   Falwell, speaking to nearly 700 newspaper editors, also said the
sex-and-money scandals that have toppled Jimmy Swaggart and Jim and
Tammy Bakker from their ministries signaled the end of celebrity
status for televangelists.
   ``There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a person
that people look up to as God,'' Falwell said. ``Celebrity status
is history.''
   Asked about Jackson's bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Falwell said, ``I have no problem with Reverend Jackson
running, as long as he loses.
   ``I don't think the American people want a reverend _ it has
nothing to do with Democrat, Republican, black, white, liberal,
conservative. I don't think the American people are ready for a
reverend to be in the White House, and I think it's a pretty good
idea one never is.''
   Falwell, participating in a panel discussion on the second day
of the three-day American Society of Newspaper Editors convention,
said he was heartened by a decision by a television committee
within the National Religious Broadcasters to punish Swaggart.
   The committee members ``are recommending to all Christian
stations in America that are members of the National Religious
Broadcasters ... to drop Jimmy Swaggart's program if, in fact, he
does not comply with the one-year required penalty placed upon him.
... Stations do not have to comply, but my guess is most of them
will.''
   Earlier today, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, urged the
editors to support him in his battle to get a comprehensive trade
bill passed by Congress.
   ``You hold the key to developing a thoughtful commentary on
events,'' Wright said, later adding, ``I challenge you to report
the bill in some depths.''
   In a session late Wednesday, big-city mayors gave generally good
grades to newspapers for coverage of the plight of the urban poor,
but said the media misunderstand the rise of blacks' political
power and often fail to put a city's problems into a national
context.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young said he has been pleased that the
number of black reporters covering City Hall has increased in
recent years, while Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode noted the
new prominence given to black columnists.
   But Goode said he was concerned that some newspapers are not
adequately covering the growth of black political power in cities.
``Maybe some newspapers even resent it,'' he said.
   Goode said he also believes the local media tend to report
problems such as homelessness and inadequate housing from a local
context rather than explaining that cities across the country are
facing similar troubles.
   San Antonio, Texas, Mayor Henry Cisneros faulted the media for
failing to report more on the problems of the underclass.
   ``These issues are not minority issues,'' Cisneros said. ``These
are America's issues.''
   Former New York Mayor John Lindsay said blacks and other
minorities have made major strides in the 20 years since a national
commission warned that America ``is moving toward two societies,
one black, one white.''
   But, Lindsay said, ``There are still miles to go.''
   Lindsay criticized the Reagan administation for doing nothing to
erase the economic differences between blacks and whites, and
concluded: ``We probably have a worse problem now in relations
between whites and blacks.''
   The discussion of coverage of urban affairs followed a session
earlier Wednesday in which Arnold Rosenfeld, editor of the Austin
(Texas) American-Statesman, delivered an ASNE report on minority
employment on newspaper staffs. A survey of 67 percent of the
nation's 1,630 daily newspapers showed a slow growth in the past
year in employment of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American
Indians, from 6.56 percent to 7.02 percent.
   ``Obviously, much needs to be done,'' Rosenfeld said.
   Linda Grist Cunningham, editor of the Trenton (N.J.) Times,
reported on a survey of journalists that found ``the people who
gather and process the news today are predominantly white and male,
but women and minorities are gaining in numbers.''

   An escaped murderer who had vowed revenge
on the people who helped imprison him was recaptured today, a
week-and-a-half after he and two other killers fled the West
Virginia State Penitentiary.
   Meanwhile, deputies in Marshall County, W.Va., were chasing one
of the other two escapees, who ran away when police checked his
identification at a routine traffic stop this morning.
   Robert Dean Stacy, 35, was arrested this morning at the
apartment of a friend, where he was hiding in a closet, the FBI
said.
   Stacy was unarmed and no weapons were found in the apartment
when police and FBI agents searched the apartment of James Kennedy
shortly before 8 a.m. Kennedy was taken into custody for
questioning, the FBI said.
   Stacy had been convicted of killing a Huntington, W.Va., police
officer and accused of shooting a Huber Heights officer and had
vowed revenge on those who had helped convict him, officials said.
   Police had assigned protection to the judge and prosecutor in
his case and a Columbus woman who testified against Stacy.
   A federal court magistrate ordered Stacy returned to West
Virginia to face a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution _
a charge that stems from the April 3 escape of the three men from
the 122-year-old penitentiary.
   In Marshall County, W.Va., today, Tommie Mollohan, 45, one of
the other two men who escaped with Stacy, ran away after deputies
pulled him over.
   Mollohan, said Marshall County sheriff's dispatcher Lynell
Kearans, gave deputies his correct last name, Social Security
number and date of birth, but added a fictitious first name. He
fled when the deputy radioed headquarters for confirmation of the
information, she said.
   ``He ran down over the hill, and we're in the process of a
manhunt right now,'' Ms. Kearans said. Authorities found a shotgun
and shells in the car, as well as .22-caliber ammunition with no
corresponding weapon, and said they assume Mollohan is armed.
   Mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a grocer in
1973. At the time, Mollohan had escaped from a Florida prison and
also was wanted in Georgia and North Carolina on armed robbery
charges.
   The third escapee is David Williams, 28. He was convicted of
felony murder, arson and robbery in the December 1980 slaying of a
Marytown, W.Va., resident who was found bludgeoned in the rubble of
his burned home.
   All three men were serving life terms. Numerous sightings of the
escapees have been reported since the three used stolen bolt
cutters to escape from the prison at Moundsville, W.Va.

<TEXT>
   A Hong Kong television station was fined the
equivalent of $2,500 Thursday for showing a TV series that
contained what the government called ``excessive violence.''
   It was the first such fine imposed by the Broadcasting Authority.
   The drama series ``The Final Verdict'' on Hong Kong Television
Broadcasts Ltd. depicted ``the brutal killing of a family of six''
that had ``contravened the codes of practice relating to program
standards,'' the authority said. The statement did not elaborate.
   It said the authority had received 97 complaints about the show,
including many that claimed the Cantonese-language series portrayed
the police force in a bad light. The series was in part about
police corruption.
   ``The Broadcasting Authority, while taking the view that proper
regard should be given to the needs of creative work in drama
productions, was of the opinion that the approach adopted in the
series could have been more balanced,'' the statement said.
   The TV station said it had been verbally informed of the
authority's decision and was awaiting further details.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Thursday
pledged continued supplies of U.S. arms to Moslem guerrillas
fighting the Communist government in Afghanistan after he signed
the accord on the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   After eight years and four months of American pleas with the
Kremlin to pull its soldiers out of Afghanistan, Shultz and Foreign
Minster Eduard A. Shevardnadze put their signatures on an accord
requiring Soviet withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 now are there helping fight the Moslem insurgency.
   The secretary acknowledged that Afghanistan's future remains
cloudy. Although the Red Army is leaving, he said, the superpowers
will continue arming the factions and more work by the United
Nations will be needed to establish an independent government and
bring home the estimated 5 million Afghan refugees.
   ``I don't think anyone knows how that will take place,'' he told
a news conference, but added: ``History has been made today.''
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez negotiated the agreement signed
Thursday by Afghanistan and Pakistan, and by the United States and
Soviet Union as guarantors.
   Shultz told reporters: ``For over eight years the Afghan people
have suffered a brutal war that has brought unmeasurable death,
dislocation and destruction.
   ``The world community has long sought to remove the cause of
this agony: the Soviet military of Afghanistan. This effort has
succeeded, and the Soviet Union is now committed to firm dates to
comment and complete the withdrawal of its forces.''
   Half the Soviet forces are to withdraw within 90 days, beginning
May 15, and Afghanistan and Pakistan pledge not to interfere in
each others' affairs. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in
Pakistan, most in border camps and cities that serve as bases and
supply points for the guerrillas.
   Shultz said the pledge by Pakistan, through which hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of U.S. military aid has flowed, does not
prevent the United States from continuing to arm the insurgents.
   He said the United States does not recognize the Afghan
government and ``we have made clear to Soviet leaders that,
consistent with our obligations as guarantor, it is our right to
provide military aid to the resistance.''
   At the same time, the secretary added, ``we are ready to
exercise that right, but we are prepared to meet restraint with
restraint.''
   ``Through their blood and sacrifice, the Afghans have earned the
opportunity to resume their independence,'' he said before signing
the accord.
   After Soviet troops entered Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter
retaliated with economic sanctions against the Soviets, including a
grain embargo, and kept the U.S. team out of the 1980 Olympics in
Moscow.
   President Reagan's administration softened the sanctions, but
Reagan and his aides continued berating the Soviets at
international conferences, including three summits with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Shultz said Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan will remove ``a
major burden to Soviet-American relations.''
   ``The faithful implementation of the withdrawal commitments
embodied in the accords signed today will do much to improve the
atmosphere for our bilateral relations and for the resolution of
other regional conflicts,'' he said.
   The settlement demonstrates that ``a major power cannot impose
its will by force of arms on even the smallest country when its
citizens are united in their resistance,'' Shultz declared.

   Egypt said Thursday it will send more than
150 tons of relief supplies to Palestinian victims of Israeli
security operations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif announced the decision
after a meeting President Hosni Mubarak had with some of his
Cabinet ministers.
   Mubarak later flew to Jordan's capital Amman for a two-day visit
and talks with King Hussein on U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace
efforts.
   El-Sherif told reporters the Red Crescent Society, which is
Egypt's equivalent of the Red Cross, will send 159 tons of food and
medical supplies ``as assistance to victims of the uprising'' in
the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``Contacts are in progress on how the supplies can be
delivered,'' he added, apparently referring to an Egyptian approach
to Israel.
   El-Sherif also said without elaboration that Mubarak and his
ministers ``discussed ways of supporting the uprising politically.''
   Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and established
diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level.
   Cairo has condemned repeatedly what it terms Israel's
``repressive measures'' to quell the 4-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   Mubarak has said the uprising should continue so as to spur
efforts for an overall peaceful settlement of the 40-year-old
conflict between Israel and the Arabs.

   The U.S. trade deficit widened dramatically in
February to $13.8 billion, its biggest shortfall since October and
the second straight jump, the government said today.
   Prices of stocks and the value of the dollar fell almost
immediately in reaction to the announcement that the gap between
imports and exports rose $1.4 billion from January's $12.4 billion
imbalance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell nearly 45
points in the first few minutes of market activity but regained
about 8 points of that loss through the first 90 minutes of trading.
   The Federal Reserve Bank and central banks in Europe intervened
in the foreign exchange markets, buying dollars in large volumes
after the currency lost 2 percent of it value against the Japanese
yen and the German mark almost immediately after the announcement.
   Analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the February
deficit would shrink slightly.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented, ``The overall
report is discouraging in the sense that it went up instead of
down.'' However, he said, the average trade deficit for January and
February is $1.2 billion less than for the fourth quarter of 1987.
   ``The trade figures released this morning should be seen in
context. As we have said before, too much emphasis should not be
placed on any one month's figures,'' Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III told reporters.
   ``We've stumbled here a little bit,'' said Jay Goldlinger, an
analyst for Capital Insight, an economic consulting firm based in
Los Angles. ``It reminds us that we have a major, major problem.''
   For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an
annual rate of $157.6 billion, below the record $171.2 billion of
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $156.2
billion in 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products
increased by $2.3 billion in February. Leading the surge were
imports of electrical equipment from abroad, up $323 million, and
auto and truck parts, up $298 million.
   U.S. exports also rose, but by a smaller $1.3 billion from
January.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, who is in Moscow, said in
a statement released by his office here that the February figures
were disappointing despite what he called an ``underlying favorable
trend.''
   ``The figures show a substantial improvement from the average
$15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,''
Verity said. ``We look forward to continued export-led growth.''
   Analysts had anticipated an improvement in the trade balance in
February because of the normally slack winter demand for imported
goods, lower oil prices0and the fact that the month is the shorvest
of the y`ally is too early to tell,'' Howard said. ``Underwater
explosion is the way to describe it. We don't know what caused the
explosion. All we've got is an underwater explosion at this point.''
   Howard said the Roberts was steaming in the area after
completing an escort operation Wednesday night. The spokesman said
he assumed ``there were no other U.S. vessels in close proximity,''
but couldn't say for sure.
   ``They say the flooding is under control and they're pumping the
thing out and doing that under auxiliary power,'' Howard said.
   The Roberts is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the
USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air
attack. Thirty-seven Americans died in that attack.
   Ships of the Oliver Hazard Perry class normally carry a crew of
about 190 sailors and 13 officers, but Howard said he could not
immediately provide a precise count of the number of men on the
Roberts.
   One Pentagon official who asked not to be named said the
explosion ``does not appear to have been caused by any failure of
systems on board the ship.''
   Another source added: ``The Roberts hit something; we are
assuming it was a mine.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan had been told of the incident. Fitzwater said that he did
not know how Reagan was told, but that the president was
``routinely informed'' about such matters by national security
adviser Colin Powell or a member of the National Security Council
staff.
   Fitzwater said the incident ``only emphasizes our concern for
stopping the Iran-Iraq war,'' which has led to the mining of the
gulf.
   He said the administration intended to step up pressure in the
U.N. Security Council for a resolution that would not only put an
end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions
against belligerents in the war.

   Trumpets blared and thousands of mourners shouted
``God is great!'' as this tiny country on Thursday buried two
people slain on a hijacked Kuwaiti jetliner and vowed it would not
meet the sky pirates' demands.
   ``Kuwait will never give in to blackmail, simple as that,'' said
Faisal al-Marzouk, chief editor of Al-Anbaa newspaper and one of
nearly 2,000 people attending the funeral.
   ``Even if they kill all the hostages there on the plane, we'll
never, ever release the killers who are here in Kuwait,'' he added,
referring to the hijackers' demand for the freedom of 17 convicted
terrorists.
   A military honor guard escorted the flag-draped bodies of Khalid
Ayyub Bandar, 20, and Abdullah Shibib al-Khalidi, 24, into the
ghost-like sea of mourners in traditional white Arab robes and
headdresses.
   Hundreds of men stretched out hands to touch the biers as
relatives carrying the bodies forced a weaving path through the
throng to reach the graves dug in sandy soil.
   Traditional Moslem chants of ``Allahu Akbar!'' (``God is
great!'') and ``La Illah Illa Allah!'' (``There is no God but
God!'') resounded across the cemetery as tightly packed mourners
passed stones over their heads to reach those at graveside who were
covering the bodies.
   The crown prince, Sheik Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah, led the
procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male
relatives of the slain men.
   Many kissed the prince, who has three distant relatives still
aboard the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 that was seized April 5 on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and flown to Iran, Cyprus and now
Algiers.
   All of those interviewed said they supported the government's
refusal to grant the hijackers' demands, and some blamed Iran for
the jet's seizure.
   ``Everybody agrees on one point, that we should not give in ...
no matter what the sacrifices,'' said Abdullah al-Saleh, a
businessman.
   ``I think if we get the hijackers we should kill them, one after
the other, so there'll be no one to do such a thing again,'' said
Ghassahn al-Kunaini, a mechanical engineer. ``I do not accept
anything, no deals.''
   He denounced the hijackers' claims to be acting for Islam.
``These people, they know nothing about Islam,'' Kunaini said.
   Marzouk said ``Kuwait has set an example that you never, ever
negotiate with terrorists.
   ``I think its unfortunate that the United States, Germany,
France, they have always wanted to negotiate for the release of the
hostages in Lebanon,'' he added. ``Once you give in to blackmail
once, you always give in to blackmail.''
   Kuwait has repeatedly refused to consider freeing the 17 Islamic
radicals, who were imprisoned for a series of bombings.
   On Wednesday, the defense minister, Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah said ``Kuwait would not cave in, and would not change its
attitude toward blackmail.''
   The radical Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan said Thursday the
hijackers in Algiers were demanding that Kuwait commute the death
penalty for three convicts condemned to death who are among the 17.
Al-Watan did not give sources for its story.

   President Reagan will nominate Washington
attorney Judith Richards Hope, daughter-in-law of entertainer Bob
Hope, to succeed Robert H. Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals here,
the White House announced today.
   Mrs. Hope, who had reportedly turned down the offer once but
changed her mind after a call from Reagan, is a partner in the
Washington office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker.
   Mrs. Hope 47, was national co-chairman of Lawyers for
Reagan-Bush in 1984 and general counsel to the presidential
campaign of Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   From 1975 to 1977, she was an associate director in the domestic
policy office of the White House. She is a former deputy director
of the California Rural Development Corp.
   The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate.
   Mrs. Hope and her husband, Anthony, also a lawyer, have two
children.
   The appeals court here is considered among the most important
federal appeals courts because it handles disputes over
governmental regulations and programs. Judges are appointed for
life and now draw an annual salary of $95,000.
   Bork resigned from the bench in February, four months after his
nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated by the Senate in a
bitter fight.

<HEAD>Uninsured Workers Tell Hard-Luck Stories To House Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uninsured workers with medical problems told
their hard-luck stories Thursday to a House panel weighing a
sweeping plan to require that employers offer minimum health
benefits.
   The employees _ including a a grocery store clerk from
Philadelphia and a doctors' office receptionist from Denver _ said
they have had to cope with inadequate medical care, unaffordable
bills or both.
   Annette Lopez, the receptionist, said the federal Medicaid
program paid for her daughter Colleen's two-month stay in the
hospital after she was born prematurely. But she said five
subsequent hospital stays have cost $22,000 _ and there's no one to
pay it but herself and her husband on their wages of $6 an hour
each.
   ``Even if I paid $100 every month, she'd be in college if not
out of college by the time we ended up paying this bill,'' said
Mrs. Lopez.
   Daniel Casey, the clerk, said his parents were uninsured, had
diabetes and died in their 30s for lack of proper medical care. He
said he has diabetes and no insurance, and must depend on clinics
with spotty care and no evening hours.
   ``If I get sick I must choose between working and supporting my
family or going to the doctor and losing a day's pay,'' said Casey.
``If my employer had a mandatory insurance program, I could go to a
regular pharmacy and see a doctor in the evening.''
   The testimony came at a hearing before the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment.
   There are an estimated 37.2 million Americans without health
insurance. About two-thirds of them are workers or dependents who
would be covered by the plan under consideration by Congress.
   The bill, introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., would require employers to provide a
minimum package of health insurance to people working 17.5 hours a
week or more. Benefits would have to include hospital and doctor
care, prenatal and well-baby care, diagnostic testing and
catastrophic protection.
   Employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium. Pool
arrangements and a phase-in period would make plans more affordable
to small or new firms. The Senate version of the bill, already
approved by Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee, also
says very small or new employers would only have to provide
catastrophic protection.
   The business community is divided on the plan. Many firms say
they are philosophically opposed to mandated benefits, but
corporations with health plans complain they are indirectly footing
the bill for firms without them.
   The Washington Business Group on Health, representing hundreds
of Fortune 500 companies and other employers, said in a statement
Thursday that ``with each month, we hear from more members who
think that a federal mandate is far from the worst alternative.
And, many of the changes we wanted have been accepted.''
   Willis Goldbeck, president of the group, said the Kennedy-Waxman
bill ``clearly does not have the support of the business
community'' but said there is ``considerable strength to the
growing trend of acceptance among many major companies.''
   John Lester, owner of a small carpentry and construction
business in Warren, N.H., said the bill would help small companies
like his. He said he offers health insurance as an ethical
obligation but its high cost keeps him from expanding.
   Furthermore, Lester said, ``in my attempts to be responsible now
and in the future, I am put at a competitive disadvantage against
those (employers) who do not insure.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a prime opponent of the
Kennedy-Waxman bill and said Thursday it would cause many workers
to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs.
   The group is proposing alternatives it says would encourage
rather than require employers to offer coverage. Among them:
eliminating state minimum benefit requirements and allowing
unincorporated businesses the same tax deductions enjoyed by
incorporated firms.
   The state of Hawaii has a law similar to the Kennedy-Waxman
bill. The Massachusetts legislature on Wednesday passed an even
more sweeping measure that guarantees health coverage to everyone,
not just people with jobs.

<HEAD>Gore Widens Nuclear-Policy Dispute With Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS new poll results in grafs 9-10, Dukakis had</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Gore Jr. widened his nuclear-policy dispute with rival
Michael Dukakis today, saying the Massachusetts governor and his
staff misstated U.S. and NATO positions on the subject. Meanwhile,
a new poll showed Dukakis leading Jesse Jackson in New York, with
Gore far behind both men.
   With less than a week to go before the big New York primary,
with 255 delegates at stake, Gore, in an attempt to get back in the
race, has vigorously attacked Dukakis on the nuclear issue. Dukakis
and his campaign aides have said Gore's charges are simply wrong,
the efforts of a desperate candidate.
   The latest controversy began Wednesday when Gore said Dukakis
erred in an interview in the New York Daily News by saying he would
consider first use of strategic nuclear weapons in case of a Soviet
conventional attack in Europe.
   Gore denounced that Wednesday as ``a major blunder'' but Dukakis
strongly denied that it was. Dukakis said he had merely reflected
existing American and NATO policy in holding open the option of a
nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of Western Europe
with conventional forces.
   In a speech today to the American Society of Newspaper Editors,
Gore said Dukakis' staff compounded the first mistake by misstating
NATO policy about using nuclear weapons.
   ``To say NATO policy is `no early first use' is another error.
... We have not adopted that policy. NATO has not adopted that
policy,'' Gore told the newspaper editors.
   ``Governor Dukakis and his campaign spokesman apparently don't
know that,'' Gore said at a news conference following the speech.
   The new poll released today indicated Jackson was gaining
support in New York but that Dukakis was maintaining his own
strength. Gore apparently had not picked up ground despite his
vigorous campaigning.
   Dukakis had the support of 46 percent of 359 registered
Democrats surveyed Monday and Tuesday by the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion, followed by Jackson with 34 percent,
Gore with 7 percent and ``uncommitted'' with 5 percent. Eight
percent of those polled were undecided.
   A previous Marist poll, conducted April 5-6, showed Dukakis with
47 percent, Jackson 31 percent and Gore with 6 percent. Eight
percent were uncommitted and 6 percent undecided. The polls' margin
of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   On Wednesday, Jackson appeared in Albany, N.Y., with Gov. Mario
Cuomo. Cuomo called Jackson a ``singularly important Democrat,''
and Jackson thanked Cuomo for holding off on any endorsements until
after the primary season June 7.
   ``Gov. Cuomo, just keep a freeze on all endorsements and keep
extending your support,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson continued to be plagued, however, by hostility from the
Jewish community _ and from President Reagan, who said politicians
have withheld their criticism of Jackson for fear of being called
racist.
   Reagan has rarely singled out any of the Democratic candidates
for criticism. But he told the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in Washington: ``I have to believe that a great many of us
would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that
he is proposing, and would perhaps be more vocal about them, if it
wasn't for concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of
a racial attack.''
   Republican George Bush called during the final day of a
three-day swing in New York for mandatory death penalties for
certain drug-related crimes, reflecting the prominence of the drug
issue in this year's campaign.
   ``And, frankly, I'd like to find a way to make this penalty
swift,'' he said in a breakfast speech to the Association for a
Better New York.
   Gore stirred the new foreign policy controversy after Dukakis
told the Daily News ``we reserve the right to use nuclear force''
in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe ``when there appears to
be no other alternative.'' He added, ``I don't think that's going
to happen.''
   Gore, battling for survival, quickly jumped on the Massachusetts
governor and said he had ``made a significant mistake in saying
that he would launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union
under ... specific circumstances.''
   At a news conference in Boston, Dukakis said Gore ``ought to get
his facts straight.''
   ``The policy I advocated has been the policy of the government
of the United States for many, many years,'' he said. ``It's the
policy of the NATO alliance.''
   At an appearance Wednesday night before Westchester County,
N.Y., Democrats, Gore said the transcript of the interview showed
Dukakis had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use
of ``strategic'' weapons
   ``NATO has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,''
Gore said. ``The president of the United States has traditionally
refused to respond to that hypothetical.''
   James Steinberg, defense and foreign policy adviser to Dukakis,
said Dukakis started answering the question thinking he was being
asked about tactical nuclear weapons and that after Dukakis started
speaking the questioner made reference to ``strategic.''
   The transcript shows a comma before the phrase ``as a strategic
weapon?''
   Steinberg said he assumed Dukakis would have given a different
answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear
weapons.

<TEXT>
   Two lawmakers are asking Secretary of George
Shultz to intervene with negotiators trying to free a hijacked
Kuwaiti jumbo jet because one of men holding the plane may also be
responsible for the kidnapping of American hostages in Beirut.
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep. Louise Slaughter, both New York
Democrats, wrote Shultz on Wednesday to point out published reports
that one of the Kuwaiti jet hijackers may be Imad Mughniyeh, who
they said may have been the chief kidnapper of American hostage
Terry Anderson.
   ``We know the United States is not a primary party to the
Algiers negotiations. But if Terry Anderson's chief kidnapper is
one the Kuwaiti jet, the United States government must insure that
the negotiators are aware of this fact,'' Moynihan and Slaughter
told Shultz.
   ``It would be a travesty for Imad Mughniyeh to go free while
Terry Anderson remains a captive,'' they said.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped more than three years ago.
   The independent Kuwaiti newspaper, al-Qabas, quoted unidentified
sources Wednesday as saying Mughniyeh was believed to have boarded
the plane when it stopped in Iran after being hijacked on a flight
from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait.
   Moynihan and Slaughter did not ask Shultz to directly involve
the United States in the negotiations to free the hostages being
held aboard the jumbo jet in Algiers.
   But, they said, ``we must not let any possibility for his
release remain unexplored or any effort left undone.''
   ``We ask you to give this matter your immediate attention,''
they wrote Shultz. ``Please keep us informed about any information
the State Department or other government agencies learn about this
linkage between the hijacking and Terry's kidnapping as well as any
steps you take to secure Terry's release.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, lives in Batavia, N.Y., in Rep.
Slaughter's district.

<TEXT>
   The United States will consult with the Soviet
Union on problems of getting food to the more than 2 million people
threatened with starvation in northern Ethiopia, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Fitzwater said he did not know the exact forum for the
discussions, but that Secretary of State George Shultz ``may raise
it'' during his meeting today in Geneva with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, or at their meetings in Moscow next
week.
   The spokesman said the discussions would focus on ``helping to
bring pressure on the government of Ethiopia to allow food aid to
resume for the starving people of Tigray and Eritrea.''
   ``There are more than 2 million people at risk in that part of
the country. ... You recall the government of Ethiopia has ordered
relief workers out of the region and we are very concerned about
not being able to provide food supplies'' to the people, Fitzwater
said.
   On Thursday, the State Department called the Marxist
government's shutdown of international relief operations in
northern Ethiopia ``a human catastrophe.''
   The area has seen intense fighting between separatist rebels
battling Ethiopian leader Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam's rule and
loyalist troops.

<HEAD>Woman Goes Ahead With Abortion Despite Court Order</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 4th graf, `Their notice ...,' with
Supreme Court spokeswoman saying case will have to go through
normal appeals process.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman underwent an abortion in defiance of
a court order obtained by the would-be father, but attorneys for
both sides still want the state Supreme Court to settle the dispute.
   At issue is whether a woman has the sole authority to decide to
have an abortion or if a father has rights that give him a say in
the decision.
   Attorneys for the 18-year-old Terre Haute woman told the high
court Wednesday that she had terminated her first-trimester
pregnancy, but said the decision was hers alone.
   Their notice came a day after they asked the high court for an
immediate review of the lower court injunction that prohibited an
abortion.
   A spokesman for the Supreme Court said today that the case will
go through the normal appeals process because speed is no longer
essential.
   ``The case will go through the Indiana Court of Appeals since it
is not an emergency any more,'' said the spokeswoman. ``It probably
will get back to us eventually. But there is no emergency now, and
it has to go through the channels.''
   A 61-page brief by the man's attorney, James Bopp Jr., said the
woman's reasons for wanting an abortion are ``an immature reasoning
process, are insubstantial and border on the frivolous, and do not
outweigh the strong interests of the father in seeing the child
born and in his custody.''
   Bopp described the woman as an unemployed high school dropout
who began a relationship with the man, a delivery truck driver in
Terre Haute, following a date on New Year's Eve.
   The lower court ruling cited testimony that the woman wanted an
abortion to preserve her figure so she would look good in a bathing
suit and to avoid being pregnant during the summer, Bopp said.
   The woman's attorneys refused to say where or when the abortion
was performed.
   ``Faced with the decision of continuing with an unwanted
pregnancy and with violating a court order, she made the decision
she felt was right,'' said the notice signed by her attorney,
Richard A. Waples, legal director of the Indiana Civil Liberties
Union.
   ``She did what she had to do to protect both her physical and
emotional health,'' it said.
   Bopp, general counsel for the national Right to Life
organization, said Wednesday he thinks ``somebody was exploiting
and victimizing her to get her to get an abortion.''
   ``An extremely serious and distressing thing has happened,'' he
said, adding that his client ``is absolutely devastated that his
child has been taken from him.''
   Bopp said he and his client haven't considered seeking a
contempt citation against the woman for violating Vigo County
Circuit Judge Robert H. Brown's order issued last week. On Monday,
Brown issued a permanent injunction.
   ``He loves this girl,'' Bopp said of his 24-year-old client.
``He's not interested in punishing her.''
   If allowed to stand, Brown's ruling invites other Indiana courts
``to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiry into,
and overruling of, a competent adult woman's decision to terminate
her first trimester pregnancy,'' Waples told the court.
   The woman's attorneys said her first trimester would have ended
sometime during the next two weeks.
   Waples argued Brown's injunction violated the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in Roe vs. Wade, which upheld a woman's right to an
abortion during the first trimester of a pregnancy.
   Waples also said the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that a
spouse cannot veto a woman's decision to end a pregnancy during the
first three months.
   Bopp said he wants a ruling detailing what rights a father has
in such cases. ``Fathers have rights in particular cases. All we
said in this case is we want those rights to be balanced'' with
those of the mother, Bopp said.
   Since the case involves a paternity action, neither the woman
nor the man has been identified in court records.

   An explosion rocked downtown
Johannesburg today, but there were no immediate reports of injuries
or damage.
   Police cordoned off a block in front of City Hall, where the
early evening blast apparently occurred.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear, and police
at the scene refused to comment on the incident. The explosion at
about 6:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. EDT) was heard and felt at the offices
of The Associated Press, about four blocks from City Hall.
   There was no sign of injuries or damage to the exterior of City
Hall.
   Lynn Wootton, 12, said he saw wisps of smoke rising from the
City Hall building shortly after the explosion. However, other
witnesses near City Hall at the time of the explosion said they
only felt the blast and did not see any smoke or evidence of damage.

   About 3,000 West Coast writers picketed
Walt Disney Studios before they met to discuss granting waiver
contracts in their 6-week-old strike against movie and television
producers.
   The Los Angeles meeting of about 1,000 striking writers
following the mass picketing was closed to the public and news
media. Results of a vote on the waiver contracts was withheld until
the East Coast writers vote tonight.
   A ``yes'' vote would enable writers to negotiate contracts on a
case-by-case basis with producers, even during the strike, if the
Writers Guild of America grants a waiver. Such waivers are not
given lightly _ the WGA refused a special request for one at
Monday's Academy Awards show.
   Meanwhile, the union disclosed that it had asked a federal
mediator to step in to try to restart bargaining talks.
   ``We feel very strongly that what is needed now is for the two
parties to meet,'' said WGA spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   Joining picketing writers in Burbank were Joanna Kerns, star of
the ABC television series ``Growing Pains,'' actor Mike Farrell and
``Cheers'' star John Ratzenberger.
   ``Every strike ultimately hurts everyone,'' said Ms. Kerns, who
said her show's shooting schedule for new fall episodes has been
pushed back from July to August.
   The picketing at Disney was the largest demonstration by the
writers since a mass protest outside CBS Studios in Los Angeles on
March 11.
   Circling overhead was an aircraft towing a banner reading,
``Stop Mickey Mousing Around With The WGA.''
   Federal mediator Leonard Farrell scheduled a Monday morning
meeting between union bargainers and negotiators for the Alliance
of Motion Picture & Television Producers.
   The meeting was requested by the writers union and ``by law we
must attend and will,'' said Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the
producers. However, he added, ``Our attitude hasn't changed.''
   The 9,000-member WGA went on strike against the producers March
7. There have been no formal negotiations since talks broke off
March 10.
   Disputed issues include how much writers are paid for foreign
broadcasts of their material and for reruns on domestic television,
and how much creative control they have over their work.

   Actor Jan-Michael Vincent was
arrested for investigation of felony drug possession after deputies
stopped his wife's car because its registration had expired and
allegedly found amphetamines, authorities said today.
   ``He was arrested for possession of 15 white amphetamine
tablets'' Wednesday night, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez, a Los Angeles
County sheriff's spokesman.
   ``He was booked at Malibu (sheriff's) station,'' Ramirez said.
``His arrest occurred after a car stop on Thousand Oaks Boulevard
in Agoura Hills.''
   Vincent, 42, was released after posting $1,000 bail, the deputy
said.
   ``His wife was driving and he was a passenger,'' but his wife
wasn't arrested, said Lt. John Love, of the sheriff's station in
Malibu.
   Love declined to specify how the drugs were discovered, but said
the Vincents' car was stopped because it had an expired, 1986
registration.
   Vincent was cooperative during the arrest and booking, Love said.
   Ramirez said the vehicle wasn't impounded, he said.
   Agoura Hills is located about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles. Vincent lives nearby in Malibu.

   The Soviet Union has followed up on informal
pledges and officially notified the United States that it has
stopped commercial whaling, U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity said Thursday.
   ``This is a significant international achievement which removes
a major obstacle to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in fisheries,'' Verity
told a news conference.
   The Soviets announced in 1985 that they would stop commercial
whaling and an offical of the ministry of the fishing industry
confirmed it to reporters in May. But it was unclear whether the
Soviet Union would continue limited whaling for scientific purposes.
   The International Whaling Commission, to which the Soviet Union
belongs, agreed in 1982 to a moratorium on commercial whaling
beginning in 1986 to give whale stocks a chance to recover from
severe cuts. The Soviet Union, Japan and Norway objected.
   William Evans, undersecretary of commerce for oceans and
atmosphere, told The Associated Press after the news conference
that Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin had formally notified Verity of
the cessation of commercial whaling in a meeting in Washington
earlier this month.
   Verity plans to certify to President Reagan that the Soviet
Union is complying with the whaling moratorium, Evans said.
   Under a 1967 law, the president may order an embargo of the
fishery products of any country conducting a fishing operation that
diminishes the effectiveness of an international fishery
conservation program.
   Verity said he hopes the Soviet cessation of commercial whaling
will allow for an expansion of fishing cooperation provided for in
a new agreement signed Feb. 21.

   Rebounding sales helped dampen growth of
business inventories in February to a slight 0.1 percent after four
big monthly increases, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said inventories increased by only $825
million, pushing the total of unsold items on store shelves and
backlots to a seasonally adjusted $715.9 billion.
   The small gain followed a string of much steeper increases that
came in the months after the stock market crash. Inventories rose
0.7 percent in January, 0.9 percent in December, 0.8 percent in
November and 1.2 percent in October.
   Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But
Thursday's inventory numbers, along with a separate report on trade
showing a $2.3 bilion increase in imports in February, provide
evidence that domestic demand has not weakened.
   The February increase in goods held on shelves and backlots was
occurring while business sales were climbing 0.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $468.3 billion, reversing a 0.5 percent drop in
January.
   ``It's really two sides of the same puzzle,'' said Michael K.
Evans, who heads Evans Economics Inc. in Washington. ``If
inventories continued to rise at the same time that sales were
falling, that would clearly be bad news. ... But that's not
happening ... so it's OK.''
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group, a forecasting
service headquartered near Philadelphia, said imports were at least
partially responsible for the inventory growth.
   ``A lot of the inventories that had built up were imported
goods. ... That's one of the reasons I'm less concerned about the
trade numbers than I might have been,'' he said. Another Commerce
Department report Thursday showed the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit widened to $13.8 billion in February from $12.4 billion in
January.
   The February rise in inventories was held back by a 1.1 percent
fall in inventories held by retailers. This decrease reflected
primarily a 5.2 percent drop in the backlog of unsold cars.
Excluding autos, retail inventories were up 0.4 percent.
   Inventories held at the wholesale level were up 0.9 percent,
while manufacturers' inventories grew by 0.5 percent.
   The 0.6 percent overall sales rise was led by a 1.2 percent
increase in wholesale sales in February, a 0.6 percent rise in
sales by retailers and a 0.1 percent rise in sales by manufacturers.
   In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail
sales increased 0.8 percent in March.
   The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to
1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust
inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not
considered abnormally high.

   At first, Bob Jacob, sitting in the cockpit
of his plane, wasn't even aware that a small aircraft had landed on
top of him.
   Then, he said, he realized his plane was handling strangely.
   Jacob was taxiing his single-engine Cessna 172 on a runway at
Ben Epps Airport on Wednesday evening when a Cessna 170 landed on
top of his plane, straddling it.
   If it had landed 6 feet farther to the left, the prop would have
punctured his plane and struck him in the head, he said.
   ``I had this thought today that I really shouldn't go out,''
Jacob said after the accident.
   Both Jacob and the other pilot, Walter Klussman, escaped injury,
although damage to the aircraft appeared to be extensive.
   ``They should both be dead,'' said Frank Dively, manager of the
small airport. ``In a situation like that, usually there's fire and
major casualties, but both walked away from it.''
   Dively said Klussman, who was unaware the airport tower was
closed, was attempting to talk to someone in the tower when the
accident occurred. The two pilots were using different radio
frequencies, so they were unaware of each other's presence, he said.
   Klussman was flying from Naples, Fla., to Pennsylvania and was
stopping to refuel when the accident occurred, Dively said.

   If you wanted to spend as much time
in the air as Frances Miller and Sylvia Roth, you'd have to lift
off right now and not set your plane down until late 1992.
   The two _ pilots, flight instructors and business partners with
a combined total of more than 40,000 hours of flying time _ retire
their wings this year.
   Ms. Miller, who was one of the first women in the state to
receive the pilot examiners rating back in the 1950s, retires
Friday, while Ms. Roth plans to retire in June. She was the first
woman in the nation to be designated an airline transport pilot
examiner by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1968.
   The women, both 62, will be honored Friday by the South Carolina
Aeronautics Commission. They ran a flight school in Columbia for 16
years.
   Over their combined 90-year careers, they've taught thousands of
pilots to fly and many of their former charges now are with major
airlines around the world.
   But flying was a man's pursuit when they started flying.
   ``I started when I was 17,'' Ms. Miller said. ``I just wanted to
fly.''
   ``Airplanes were something different. And Amelia Earhart was
doing her thing at that time,'' said Ms. Roth. ``They were doing
all sorts of different things and setting records.''
   Flying is easier today than it once was _ what with better
planes and more sophisticated cockpit equipment, they said. But
it's not quite as much fun, Ms. Miller said.
   ``When I was learning to fly there were so few restrictions,''
she said. ``You could take an airplane _ a J-3 Cub that didn't have
anything in it but an air speed indicator and altimeter _ and just
go anywhere in the country.''
   During their careers of teaching students the two have had
``close calls but no disasters,'' Ms. Miller said. Student pilots
tend to react in predictable ways, and instructors can usually
anticipate problems.
   ``You know what to expect,'' she said. ``Most people have the
same apprehensions and the same fears.''

<HEAD>PCBs From Mother's Milk Passed Down Six Generations, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toxic PCBs passed from mother to child through
breast milk will still be measurable in the parent's
great-great-great grandchildren, a Michigan researcher told a House
subcommittee Thursday.
   ``The problem is, these compounds refuse to go away for any
reasonable amount of time,'' said Wayland R. Swain, vice president
of Eco Logic Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., in testimony before the
House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on
investigations and oversight.
   Swain drew on earlier research into the transmission of
polychlorinated biphenyls _ PCBs for short _ to calculate the level
of the substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained
in the infant's body.
   An infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed Lake
Michigan fish would be exposed to 6.2 milligrams of PCB by the end
of 12 months, Swain said. Of that amount, 5.3 milligrams would be
retained in the infant's body.
   ``It is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed
Lake Michigan fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines (for
adults) for their entire breast-feeding experience,'' Swain said.
   The level of PCBs retained by such infants was more than seven
times the maximum consumption level recommended by the Food and
Drug Administration, Swain said.
   PCBs are passed to a child not only through beast feeding but
from the mother's body through the placenta before birth, Swain
said.
   A 20-year-old woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient
PCBs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped,
``I would still measure PCB in the body fat ... six generations in
the future,'' Swain said.
   Production of PCBs, believed to cause cancer, has been banned
for years, but the substance continues to enter the environment
through such sources as older electric transformers.
   Recent research suggests that the decline in PCB levels in the
Great Lakes has slowed, and that the substance continues to
circulate from the sediment into the water and back into the
sediment again in a perpetual cycle that produces continuing
contamination of the food chain.
   Children exposed the PCBs as infants tend to be shorter, have
smaller heads, be more likely to catch infectious diseases, and
exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings, Swain said.

   Larry Speakes, former spokesman for
President Reagan, has canceled an appearance at Denison University
because of controversy over his new book, a university spokesman
said Thursday.
   In his book, ``Speaking Out,'' Speakes said he fabricated quotes
for Reagan on at least two occasions.
   Representatives for Speakes and the university ``mutually agreed
to have this at a different time,'' Stewart Dye, a university
spokesman, said.
   Speakes, now an executive at Merrill Lynch, was to have
presented the university's Mary E. Babcock Lectureship in the
American Conservative Tradition.
   Ms. Babcock, a local philanthropist who has endowed the
lectureship to bring conservative speakers to Denison, said she got
in touch with school officials Wednesday and insisted that the
speech be canceled.
   She said she was particularly angered by Speakes saying that he
made up quotes for Reagan during the president's summit in Geneva
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985.
   ``I can't stomach that. That's ridiculous,'' Ms. Babcock said.
``People who know me well know I believe in truth.''
   Denison is a liberal arts school about 25 miles northeast of
Columbus in central Ohio. The school has an undergraduate
enrollment of about 2,100.

announced on Thursday.
   The cost to upgrade the national weather information and warning
system is expected to be about $12 million, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration reported.
   The weather wire currently operates on a system of low-speed,
land based Teletype circuits. It will be replaced by a satellite
system broadcasting directly to subscribers, the agency reported.
   The changeover is expected to begin operation in October, with
full operation for the National Weather Service completed in a year.
   The new system will deliver information at a rate 16 times
faster than the current system, according to Weather Service
director Elbert W. Friday.

   A man charged with injury to a child
after his lion mauled a little girl testified today he had taken
all the safety precautions possible, but expressed his regret about
the attack.
   Gary Durkovitz, 35, of Houston, said he was walking his
350-pound pet lion Samson on a chain at the Texas Flea Market in
Houston when the lion pounced on 8-year-old Roxanne Hernandez.
   The animal bit into the girl's skull, exposing her brain.
Roxanne has undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more
operations to correct part of a missing skull and a bald spot on
her head.
   Defense attorney Robert Scardino has called the attack by the
lion ``a tragic accident.'' Durkovitz faces a maximum two- to
10-year sentence and $5,000 fine if convicted of the felony.
   Durkovitz testified today that he had taken all the precautions
he could think of while walking the lion, who was there as part of
an exhibit, out of the flea market building.
   ``I immediately jumped on top of him and kept yelling, `No.
No,''' Durkovitz said. ``I was trying to separate little Roxanne
from the lion.
   ``I looked up at (a security guard) and said, `Shoot him, shoot
him,''' Durkovitz said. ``About the same time he shot him, he bit
down on Roxanne.
   ``I took every step I knew possible that I had been using for
two years (to prevent an accident),'' he said. ``I'm very sorry
that it happened.''
   The state rested its case Wednesday after calling Roxanne and
her mother, Sonia Hernandez.
   Roxanne, wearing a white sailor's cap to cover her injured head,
testified that all she remembered about the attack was that ``the
lion got me. I didn't know what it was.''
   Mrs. Hernandez said her daughter was in the hospital for a month
and has had problems since she returned to school in February.
   ``She has trouble concentrating on her work during the day and
she has trouble following directions,'' Mrs. Hernandez said.
   Mrs. Hernandez testified that they went to the flea market to
buy a gift and the attack occurred shortly after they entered the
building.
   ``The lion was wrestling with my daughter and I was pulling it
trying to get it off my daughter,'' Mrs. Hernandez said. ``I was
screaming out for her and she was screaming out for me.
   ``I was screaming for help and she would call out my name, `Mom!
Mom! Help me!''' Mrs. Hernandez recalled.
   Mrs. Hernandez said she pulled the lion's mane, but to no avail
and that the animal tried to put the girl's head into its mouth.
   ``I saw the lion when he took her scalp off,'' Mrs. Hernandez
said. ``I felt really helpless at that time and at that moment I
felt it was going to kill her.''
   She said a security guard shot the lion and it loosened its grip
on her child. It later was destroyed.
   Scardino also complained to State District Judge Ted Poe of
Houston that the media coverage of the trial was intense and
``pro-prosecution.''The trial of Durkovitz, a Houston resident, had
been moved here because of pretrial publicity.
   Also Wednesday, David Ruhter, mammal curator at the Houston Zoo,
testified that lions seek out children, but are intimidated by
adults.
   ``It attacks its prey because it moves,'' Ruhter said. ``It's
his livelihood. You see it in 9-week-old cats when they attack a
ball.''

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Seizures of Videotapes, Literature from
Foreigners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Videocassettes of Rambo and James Bond movies and
Western news clippings of the Chernobyl nuclear accident were among
``ideological contraband'' seized from foreigners by Soviet
customs, Tass reported Thursday.
   The official news agency did not say exactly when or over what
time period the seizures of pamphlets, books and videocassettes
took place, only that separate incidents were involved. The
dispatch was based on an article in Whistle, a newspaper of the
railroad ministry.
   Among the confiscated material were 500 ``anti-Soviet''
publications taken from two British students, identified only as D.
Warrowsmith and D. Dows. Tass said the two were at the Brest
checkpoint in Byelorussia on the Polish border when the material
was discovered.
   ``The subversive literature had been supplied to them by a
`charity' organization concerned about the alleged `suppression' of
(religious) believers,'' Tass said.
   Tass said the two had planned to distribute the material in
Minsk and Moscow, where they were headed on tourist visas.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, many formally banned authors have been published in the
Soviet Union and state-run media have tackled previously taboo
subjects. But the Tass announcement of the seizures made it clear
glasnost does not extend to material considered ``ideological
contraband.''
   Another case described in the Tass report involved a woman
identified as N. Bashkatoff of Belgium. She allegedly was carrying
several leaflets and clippings from ``the bourgeois press with
fabrications about the Chernobyl accident, concealed in her
luggage.''
   ``She also attempted absent-mindedly to leave behind in her
train compartment a maliciously slanderous book called `Moscow
Quadrille,''' Tass said.
   Another tourist, who was not identified, was caught carrying
dozens of copies of ``People on the March,'' a pamphlet which
authorities say urges Soviets of ethnic German origin to emigrate
to West Germany.
   ``Some of the latest items of ideological contraband include
video recordings of various sermons, karate lessons, with a
sadistic bent, pornography and anti-Soviet films like `Rambo' or
the James Bond `Afghan Series,''' the dispatch said.
   The latter was apparently a reference to the James Bond movie
``The Living Daylights,'' in which the fictional British agent 007,
played by Timothy Dalton, outwits the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials have bitterly complained that Sylvester
Stallone's muscled Vietnam War veteran Rambo presents a negative
stereotype of Soviets.
   The report from Tass said people carrying material judged to be
ideological contraband will be deported from the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Average American Will Have Paid Tax Obligation by May 5 This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``average'' American will have to work 126
days this year _ two more than in 1987 _ just to pay federal, state
and local taxes, the Tax Foundation said Thursday. ``Tax Freedom
Day'' will fall on May 5, the latest ever.
   The best taxpayers have fared in the past decade was in 1984 _
when most of the big 1981 federal income-tax reduction had taken
effect _ when Tax Freedom Day fell on April 28, economists for the
foundation said.
   But federal tax increases enacted in 1982, 1984 and 1987 ``have
lopped off big chunks of the '81 cuts, and Social Security hikes
have made further inroads until, like the Cheshire Cat in `Alice in
Wonderland,' nothing remains but the smile,'' the foundation said.
   Last year, the big day was May 4; this year's May 5 date is two
days later because 1988 is a leap year, which meant there was a
Feb. 29 this year.
   With the approach of the Friday midnight deadline for filing
federal tax returns _ the first under the heavily revised tax law _
there were these other tax developments:
   _The Internal Revenue Service, whose telephone ``assistors''
have been giving the wrong answer to about 28 of every 100 tax
questions this year, disclosed some factors it will consider in
determining whether to waive certain penalties for taxpayers who
follow such bad advice.
   The agency said penalties for late filing, negligence and
failure to pay can be waived if the taxpayers proves he or she
acted reasonably.
   It will consider pertinent factors such as whether the taxpayer
also sought the correct answer in an IRS publication, as well as
what specific question was asked of the assistor and what was the
actual answer.
   It also would help the taxpayer to know the name of the IRS
employee and the time and date of the telephone call.
   _House Republicans and several business organizations began a
campaign to block future income-tax increases, amend the
Constitution to require a balanced budget and pass a ``bill of
rights'' to help taxpayers in disputes with the IRS.
   Seventy-eight Republican representatives have signed a promise
to oppose raising income taxes, while 190 (mostly Republicans)
lawmakers have signed a petition requiring the House Judiciary
Committee to allow a vote on the balanced-budget amendment. Such a
vote requires the assent of 218 representatives.
   ``The federal budget can be balanced in less than four years
without raising taxes if Congress controls the growth of spending
to less than the inflation rate,'' David Keating, vice president of
the National Taxpayers Union, told a news conference sponsored by
GOP lawmakers.
   _The National Federation of Independent Business released a
survey indicating that 75 percent of business owners polled think
the tax laws are more complex since the 1986 revision. About 55
percent say their companies are spending more time on tax forms,
but two-thirds would not be willing to pay more in order to get
simpler taxes.
   The Tax Foundation, a Washington-based research organization,
assumes that individuals pay all taxes _ including those collected
from corporations _ when it calculates Tax Freedom Day. The
economists simply divide all federal, state and local tax
collections among taxpayers and assume that every penny earned each
year goes to government until tax obligations are satisfied.
   Viewed from another perspective, the foundation estimates the
average taxpayer will work 1 hour and 50 minutes each eight-hour
day to pay federal taxes, and another 55 minutes for state and
local taxes. That's two minutes longer for federal taxes than in
1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes.
   By the same measure, housing will require 1 hour and 24 minutes
(unchanged); food and tobacco, 56 minutes (two minutes less);
transportation 40 minutes (unchanged); medical care 39 minutes
(unchanged); clothing 22 minutes (one minute less); recreation 21
minutes (unchanged); and everything else will take 53 minutes of
work, one minute less than last year.

   Harry Helmsley bought his first property, a
dilapidated office building, for $1,000 in 1936. A decade later he
sold it for $165,000; now his real estate equity is estimated at
$1.4 billion.
   Leona Mindy Rosenthal, the daughter of a Brooklyn hatmaker, had
been the Chesterfield cigarette girl before she settled on a career
in real estate and, ultimately, married Harry Helmsley.
   Now this king of Manhattan real estate and the queen of the
Helmsley hotel chain are in a court devoid of royalty; they
surrendered Thursday and pleaded innocent to federal and state
charges of tax evasion, falsifying business records and, in Leona's
case, extortion conspiracy.
   The charges are so shocking because they involve people whose
wealth is nearly unbounded. Helmsley was listed 21st on the Forbes
list of the 400 richest Americans last year; he owns the Empire
State Building.
   Their estate in Greenwich, Conn., central to the charges,
consists of a 28-room Tudor mansion on 29 acres. But that is not
the only Helmsley residence: Harry and Leona also spend time at a
duplex atop the Park Lane Hotel, and at a lakefront condominium in
Palm Beach, Fla.
   Harry and Leona shower each other with gifts (sometimes paid for
with company money, according to the indictment) and their
generosity sometimes extends to others. In 1986, they made the
single largest philanthropic gesture in the country, giving $33
million to New York Hospital.
   Neither of the Helmsleys was born of wealth. Helmsley's father
was a notions buyer for a wholesale dry goods firm; the son
graduated from high school but never attended college. His first
job, as office boy at the real-estate firm he eventually came to
own, paid $12 a week.
   His credo? ``All you have to do is buy, and if you make a
mistake, the market comes along and takes care of it,'' he once
said.
   Helmsley, 79, owns 50,000 apartments and 7 million feet of
commercial space. He bought the Empire State Building, then the
world's tallest building, in the 1950s: ``Every morning you would
look out of the window and the building is staring you in the face.
So, you'd say, `Well, I gotta buy it.''
   On July 4, 1976, Helmsley lit the Empire State Building in red,
white and blue _ a tribute not to the Bicentennial, but to his
wife's birthday. It cost $100,000. ``It was less than a necklace,''
he said.
   Leona Helmsley, 67, is Harry's second wife; his previous
marriage ended in divorce in 1972 after 33 years, with no children.
Leona, too, was married before, to a lawyer whom she divorced in
1959. Her only son died in 1982.
   The former showroom model and advertising mannequin was a
successful real estate broker when Helmsley met her in 1971; he
hired her as a $500,000-a-year senior vice president and married
her a year later. By all accounts, she is just wild about Harry;
People magazine records that she calls him ``gorgeous one ...
pussycat ... snooky, wooky, dooky.''
   Shortly after their marriage, in 1973, a man wearing a gas mask
broke into their Palm Beach bedroom. ``Wake up darling, we have
company,'' Leona told her husband, nudging him awake.
   The naked Helmsleys chased the intruder, but before he fled he
stabbed Leona in the chest with a bread knife, puncturing her lung.
   When Harry put Leona in charge of the Helmsley hotels in 1980,
he was not providing her with a sinecure. She took complete charge,
and became the star of ads for the hotel chain which trumpeted her
demanding nature as a guarantee of quality.
   ``It's the only palace in the world where the Queen stands
guard,'' said one ad for the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan.
   The royal appellation is matched by a volatile, queen-size
temper, according to many employees.
   ``She comes on as extremely forthright, but that sometimes turns
into brutality,'' said one former employee, advertising executive
Jane Maas. ``She's icy, without compassion; she is remorseless and
pitiless.''
   According to the federal indictment, Leona did more than harass
her employees _ she shook them down, demanding kickbacks in
exchange for their continued employment. Sources said some two
dozen Helmsley employees testified before the grand jury under
grant of immunity.
   Harry, by contrast, is known as a courtly gentleman. He does not
envy Leona's celebrity _ the ads, the interviews, the profiles on
``60 Minutes.''
   ``I think one person should take the limelight. It dilutes if
there are two,'' Helmsley said in 1986.
   ``I have a different aspect of the business. I like to plan
buildings, organize them and finance them. Once I build it, I
couldn't care less, and that's where she comes in. She is fantastic
at entertaining and day-to-day operations _ details I hate. The
only thing I like is adding up a column of figures and getting the
bottom line.''
   Even prior to their latest legal problems, Leona Helmsley
received some unwelcome publicity when it was reported she failed
to pay more than $38,000 in sales tax for jewelry at Van Cleef &
Arpels. She was never charged, but sources said she was given
immunity for her cooperation with authorities.
   Then last year, a series of reports in the New York Post
detailed allegations that the Helmsleys had charged millions of
dollars in renovations of their Connecticut mansion to their
business. Those revelations, the basis of the indictments, were
fueled by tips from the Queen's disgruntled subjects.
   ``Most of the calls seem to have been prompted by people's
dislike of Mrs. Helmsley,'' said Post reporter Ransdell Pierson.

<HEAD>State Threatens Fines For Garbage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-plagued East St. Louis, which
hasn't had regular garbage pickup for six months, faces fines of
$10,000 or more if the city does not clean up well enough by May 3,
officials say.
   Although state laws against illegal dumping and failure to
dispose of garbage apply to all property owners, the state's action
is aimed primarily at the city, St. Clair County Assistant State's
Attorney Jeff Hoffman said Wednesday.
   ``The main thrust of this is getting rid of a public health
problem,'' Hoffman said.
   Officials in this poverty-stricken riverfront city of 55,000
told state regulators that garbage pickup should resume Friday. And
they have budgeted $210,800 of federal community development funds
to have the backlog of garbage that has piled up taken care of.
   Ken Mensing, regional manager of the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency, said that if the cleanup doesn't go fast enough,
the city could face a state injunction, fines as high as $10,000
and penalties up to $1,000 per additional day of non-compliance for
each violation, he said.
   ``Just where we would draw the line, I don't know,'' Mensing
said. ``We haven't discussed it.''
   Mensing said he could not estimate the amount of garbage that
has accumulated in East St. Louis since regular garbage pickup
ceased in October because the city owed $262,000 to the private
company that it had hired to do the collecting. The company has
since sued the city.
   The only garbage hauling that has been done since then has been
in the form of volunteer drives, or work done privately by
companies hired by individual businesses and homeowners.
   Joseph Kurre, director of the East Side Health District, said
the onset of warm weather raises the specter of disease and
increased rat infestations caused by rotting garbage.
   Over the objections of Mayor Carl Officer, other city officials
recently contracted with another private company G. Corp. to do
trash pickup until December for $350,000.
   Officer continues to contend that the city cannot afford to pay
for the service and that property owners should pay private
companies to haul away their trash.

<HEAD>Historian Urges Setting National Arts Goals for 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Schlesinger Jr. says he will urge
President Reagan's successor to appoint a special commission to set
national arts policy goals for the 1990s, which he predicted will
be a decade of ``innovation, experiment and idealism.''
   ``The time for revaluation is upon us, and it should take place
at the highest level,'' said Schlesinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian and former White House adviser to Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson.
   Schlesinger delivered the first Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and
Public Policy here Wednesday night in honor of the late chairwoman
of the National Endowment for the Arts during the Nixon
administration.
   The lecture and a black-tie dinner were cosponsored by the
American Council for the Arts, a non-profit arts advocacy
organization, with support from the Gannett Foundation.
   Schlesinger, a humanities professor at City University of New
York, said that after ``the last rather static years'' of the
Reagan administration, the nation is ready to renew its commitment
to government support of the arts and find ways to ease artists'
growing financial burdens.
   ``We must pay more attention to the unintended consequences of
legislation indirectly affecting the arts,'' he said.
   Schlesinger complained that Congress was ``notably harsh in its
treatment of writers and artists'' when it abolished charitable
deductions for non-itemizers in 1986 and prohibited artists from
deducting expenses until they begin receiving income from their
works.
   ``Government, instead of carelessly discriminating against
writers and artists, should at least give them a fair shake in the
tax code and elsewhere, especially when most writers and artists
and their families live from hand to mouth anyway,'' he said.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Private Television In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted Thursday to end the
32-year state monopoly on television broadcasting by passing a law
authorizing the creation of three private TV networks.
   The law takes effect following publication in the Official State
Bulletin.
   The law stipulates that no individual nor group may own more
than 25 percent of any of the three networks, a provision seen by
major publishing groups as an attempt to limit the influence of the
established media.
   Participation of foreign investors is limited to a second 25
percent share in any of the three networks.
   There are two state-controlled national television networks in
Spain and three more local networks controlled by the regional
governments of Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia.
   Spanish National Television was founded in 1956 during the
authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco Franco. Spaniards watch more
TV than citizens of the other 11 European Economic Community member
nations except Great Britain.
   Channel 10, a London-based company with Spanish and foreign
participation, began broadcasting in Spanish to Spain via satellite
in January.
   Since entering office in 1982, the government of Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez had pledged to enact legislation creating
three nationwide private TV networks.
   Minister of Transport, Communications and Tourism Abel Caballero
has estimated that none of the three networks will be ready to go
on the air for 18 months to three years following enactment of the
law.
   The ministry has estimated the cost of upgrading the existing
transmission network and land lines at between $45 million to $180
million.
   Once the new law goes into effect, the government is expected to
request public bids for the private network licenses based on
criteria to be set by the Transport and Communications Ministry.
   In the last three years, several publishing groups in Spain have
formed groups in preparation for the bidding.

   Democratic Party leaders and politicians whose
support as ``super delegates'' could prove crucial in winning the
presidential nomination are giving Michael Dukakis nearly half of
the 101-delegate lead he holds over rival Jesse Jackson.
   Were it not for the support of these delegates, who are going to
the Democratic National Convention because of offices they
currently or formerly held, Dukakis would be ahead of Jackson by
fewer than 44 delegate votes, according to a survey by The
Associated Press.
   Until today's gain of 52 previously uncommitted delegates in
Puerto Rico, Dukakis held but a narrow lead over Jackson without
the support of the party leaders and politicians.
   Dukakis has 816.15 delegates overall including 72.5 votes from
super delegates. He has gained 24 of those super delegates over the
last month, including nine members of the Senate nominated this
week to attend the party's convention.
   By comparison, Jackson is supported by none of the 32 senators
nominated this week. He has 715.1 delegates overall, including 30.1
super delegates, a gain of 11 over the last month.
   Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois, whose
own presidential campaigns are lagging far behind those of Dukakis
and Jackson, were nominated by their Senate colleagues to be
convention delegates. Gore picked up an additional four Senate
delegates, while Simon gained two.
   The nominations were made in a closed-door meeting of Senate
Democrats on Tuesday. A list of the nominees was obtained by the AP.
   Still, 268.25 super delegates, most of those chosen so far,
remain uncommitted, some saying they believe they have an
obligation to defer making a choice and others saying they just
can't make up their minds. Sixteen of the senators named so far are
uncommitted.
   ``It looks wide open,'' said LarryAnn Willis, a delegate from
Oregon. ``I'm not convinced that any of the three candidates still
in the field are who we should go with.''
   Others are waiting for local party leaders to make a decision so
they can follow suit. Leo O'Brien, a delegate from New York who is
party chairman in Albany County, said he put off picking a
candidate until Gov. Mario Cuomo endorsed a hopeful.
   Then Cuomo said last week he would not endorse anyone until the
primaries and caucuses are over in June.
   ``I waited for Mario, and now I'm left holding the bag,''
O'Brien said.
   In all 4,164 votes are to be cast at the national convention
July 18-21 in Atlanta, and 2,083 are needed to win the nomination.
   The super delegates from the House and Senate will be among as
many as 646 party leaders, governors and others who will be
national convention delegates.
   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson warned that the super
delegates should not be used to thwart Jesse Jackson's candidacy.
   ``I think the Democratic Party must avoid at all costs even the
perception that it is acting in any way to deny that which Jesse
Jackson has won fair and square,'' he said.
   Gore, who is running a distant third in the overall delegate
count with 404.55, has the support of 33.55 super delegates, 10 of
whom have become supporters in the last month.
   Simon, who suspended active campaigning after his single-digit,
fourth-place finish in Wisconsin, has picked up three super
delegates over the past month, raising his overall total to 171.5,
including 18.5 super delegates.
   The Simon campaign has been urging super delegates to stay
uncommitted, according to George Miller, a delegate from Texas who
said campaign officials told him ``worse things could happen than a
brokered convention.''
   While the campaigns have been trying to win over super
delegates, at least one says he's been overlooked: James Jones, a
former state senator from Virginia.
   ``I don't get no respect, even if I am a super delegate,'' he
said. ``It's amazing that no one has called, but I think it shows
the extent to which the national campaigns are stretched thin.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy frigate Samuel B. Roberts
hit a mine near Iran's Farsi Island today while on patrol in the
Persian Gulf, U.S. officials said. The Pentagon said six sailors
were injured.
   Sam Zakhem, U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain, told The Associated
Press there were no fatalities.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the ship was
in no danger of sinking. He said four of the injured sailors
suffered second-degree burns and two others had slight back
injuries.
   The injured were evacuated to a medical facility aboard the USS
Trenton, an amphibious transport dock ship, Zakhem said.
   The stricken frigate and the Trenton serve with the 10-unit U.S.
Middle East Force that patrol the Persian Gulf. The United States
has been patroling gulf waters and escorting reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers to protect them from attacks by Iran, which has been at war
with Iraq since 1980.
   Pentagon sources said the explosion occurred near Farsi Island,
which the Iranian navy has used in its attacks on gulf shipping.
   But gulf-based maritime salvage executives, speaking on
condition of anonymity, pointed to a location 50 miles north of the
Qatar peninsula and about 100 miles south of Farsi.
   At the time of the blast, the frigate was returning from
international waters off Kuwait, where it had escorted the
U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Queen, the executives said.
   The single tanker convoy reached Kuwait on Wednesday. Regions
off Farsi and others near Qatar have been infested with mines,
believed to have been laid by Iran. U.S.-led Western mine sweeping
operations in the two regions and elsewhere in the gulf last summer
detected and detonated dozens of mines.
   It was off Farsi last July that the U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti
tanker Bridgeton hit a mine in the first U.S.-protected convoy.
   Howard said there had been no recent reports by mine sweepers in
the area that mines had been sighted.
   The explosion ``caused flooding in the engine room and some hull
damage. The flooding is under control, and the ship is in the
process of pumping out the water. It's operating under auxiliary
power,'' Howard said.
   Howard said that the USS Wainwright, a cruiser, was en route to
the site to offer assistance.
   In the Persian Gulf war, Iraq said it fired long-range missiles
today at Tehran and two other Iranian cities in retaliation for an
Iranian missile that crashed into Baghdad. Both sides said many
civilians were killed or wounded.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said an Iranian missile slammed
into a residential area of Baghdad on Wednesday night. ``Many
civilians were killed and wounded, including women and children, in
addition to many houses, cars and shops being damaged,'' the agency
quoted a military spokesman as saying.
   It said Iraq responded by firing one long-range missile at
Isfahan and another at the holy city of Qom today. A third missile
was fired at Tehran.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said an unspecified
number of civilians were killed and wounded when two mosques and
several houses and shops were damaged in Isfahan and Qom.
   Tehran Radio reported that Iraqi warplanes bombed residential
areas in the city of Dezful. All the reports were monitored in
Nicosia.

   Authorities arrested two men at Rome's Leonard Da

   The two men arrested Wednesday night were identified as Mousa El

and were en route from Beirut to Freetown, Sierra Leone.
   The men told investigators they had been working as mechanics in
Beirut and had left becase their work permits had expired. They
said they intended to use the .22-caliber pistols to hunt birds.
The weapons were discovered during a routine luggage check.

   Government and Contra leaders today
agreed to renew technical talks on implementing a cease-fire and to
start high-level negotiations to end the six-year civil war.
   The stalled cease-fire technical talks were to start immediately
in the southern border post of Sapoa, site of earlier meetings. The
high-level talks were to start in Managua on Friday.
   A government delegation traveled to Sapoa almost immediately
after the agreement was announced at noon by the Contras and Manuel
Espinoza, information minister for the leftist Sandinista
government.
   The Sandinistas backed off from their demand that the technical
talks be held in Managua and agreed to a Contra request that they
be in Sapoa. In exchange, the Contras stopped insisting that
Friday's political talks begin only if the Sapoa talks were
successful.
   ``The Contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today,
they'll conclude in Managua,'' Espinoza told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview.
   Earlier today, Contra representatives Roberto Ferrey and David
Stadthagen flew into the capital's Sandino airport in a private
aircraft and were met by Tourism Minister Herty Lewites. It was the
first time the government had allowed Contras into Managua.
   On Wednesday, a Sandinista negotiator accused the Contras of not
being serious about ending the civil war.
   ``We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive
cease-fire,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told
reporter.
   ``There's a problem of confidence,'' he said, adding that the
Nicaraguan government did not want to see the talks unravel. ``If
they (Contras) don't come on the 15th (Friday), we'll have to see
the alternatives.''
   The cease-fire pact was signed March 23 in Sapoa. The talks are
to work out details of how to get Contra forces into several zones
inside Nicaragua as a prelude to ending the war.
   The military talks stalled April 8 after six rounds in which the
two sides agreed only to establish seven zones to which Contra
fighters would be confined during a 60-day truce that went into
effect on April 1.
   Still to be worked out are security for the rebels in those
zones, methods of resupplying them and other details concerning the
guerrillas during the two months allowed for negotiating a
permanent cease-fire.
   Rebel fighters are scheduled to be in the zones by Friday, but
they have not even begun gathering. The Sandinistas have agreed
that once they verify the rebels are in the zones, half of the
1,400 jailed Contras will be freed.
   Nicaragua is estimated to have more than 3,000 political
prisoners. The Sandinistas released 100 soon after the provisional
truce was signed.

   A U.S. Navy frigate on patrol in the Persian
Gulf apparently struck an underwater mine today, injuring six
sailors, the Pentagon said today.
   The ship, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, was in no danger of
sinking, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard. No one was killed and
the six sailors did not sustain life-threatening injuries, he added.
   The Pentagon said that four of the sailors had second-degree
burns; the other two had slight back injuries. None of the injuries
was considered life-threatening.
   All were flown from by helicopter from the ship for medical
treatment.
   The ship is based in Newport, R.I., and left there for Persian
Gulf duty on Jan. 11.
   ``At approximately 10:10 this morning EDT, the USS Sam Roberts
... experienced an underwater explosion in the Persian Gulf at a
point approximately 70 miles due east of Bahrain Bell (a
navigational aid),'' Howard said.
   The explosion ``caused flooding in the engine room and some hull
damage. The flooding is under control, and the ship is in the
process of pumping out the water. It's operating under auxiliary
power.''
   Howard said that the USS Wainwright, a cruiser, ``is en route to
the site to offer assistance and should be there soon.''
   The incident occurred in the central Persian Gulf, well to the
south of the spot near the Iranian-controlled Farsi Island where a
reflagged Kuwaiti tanker, the Bridgeton, hit a mine during the
first of the Navy's convoy operation last July. Howard said there
had been no recent reports by mine-sweepers in the area that mines
had been sighted.
   The spokesman refused to say that the underwater explosion had
been caused by a mine, citing the paucity of information from
initial reports.
   ``It really is too early to tell,'' Howard said. ``Underwater
explosion is the way to describe it. We don't know what caused the
explosion. All we've got is an underwater explosion at this point.''
   Howard said the Roberts was steaming in the area after
completing an escort operation Wednesday night. The spokesman said
he assumed ``there were no other U.S. vessels in close proximity,''
but couldn't say for sure.
   ``They say the flooding is under control and they're pumping the
thing out and doing that under auxiliary power,'' Howard said.
   Within hours of the explosion, the Pentagon said, the ship had
begun steaming toward port in Bahrain.
   The Roberts is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the
USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air
attack. Thirty-seven Americans died in that attack.
   Ships of the Oliver Hazard Perry class normally carry a crew of
about 190 sailors and 13 officers. The Pentagon said the Roberts
was carrying about 225 men, however, because it had a helicopter
detachment aboard from Mayport, Fla..
   One Pentagon official who asked not to be named said the
explosion ``does not appear to have been caused by any failure of
systems on board the ship.''
   Another source added: ``The Roberts hit something; we are
assuming it was a mine.''
   The Pentagon said the Roberts was under the command of Cmdr.
Paul X. Rinn. It fixed the location of the explosion at 26.25
degrees north and 52.15 degrees east.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan had been told of the incident. Fitzwater said that he did
not know how Reagan was told, but that the president was
``routinely informed'' about such matters by national security
adviser Colin Powell or a member of the National Security Council
staff.
   Fitzwater said the incident ``only emphasizes our concern for
stopping the Iran-Iraq war,'' which has led to the mining of the
gulf.
   He said the administration intended to step up pressure in the
U.N. Security Council for a resolution that would not only put an
end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions
against belligerents in the war.

   The accord for a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan was
hailed Thursday by countries in both the East and West as a vital
first step toward peace, and some offered to help Afghan refugees.
   In southern Asia, however, skepticism remained over some aspects
of the plan, particularly the continued aid to combatants.
   The agreements, signed in Geneva by representatives of the
United States, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan, will
take effect May 15 and will commit Pakistan and Afghanistan not to
support ``directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist
activities'' against each other after nine years of civil war and
Soviet entanglement.
   In Brussels, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization welcomed the
agreements and said it hoped they would yield further improvements
in superpower relations.
   ``The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan has been a serious
impediment in East West relations,'' NATO said. ``The
implementation of the Geneva agreements will, we hope, lead to
further improvements in the atmosphere between East and West.''
   Austrian Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Alois Mock called
the agreements ``a step to the strengthening of East-West
relaxation.''
   The accords open the possibility that ``other regional conflicts
be settled peacefully,'' Mock said.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi expressed concern, however,
about a continued flow of weapons to Afghan rebels and said some of
them were reaching India's Sikh extremists through neighboring
Pakistan.
   The Sikh extremists, fighting for a separate nation in Punjab,
used rocket-propelled grenades for the first time last month.
Officials in the northwest Indian state say the rebels also have
increased their stock of AK-47 assault rifles.
   Indian officials recently charged that Pakistan was helping
Sikhs acquire weapons. Pakistan denied the charge.
   The Times of India, an independent English-language daily, said
in an editorial titled ``Meaningless Agreement'':
   ``Moscow will be able to withdraw its troops without having to
acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify Afghanistan
in the face of resistance by U.S.-backed mujahedeen. But on the
face of it, the agreement will be pretty meaningless otherwise.
   ``For it will stipulate that the Americans and the Russians will
continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective
clients. And while Pakistan will formally agree not to interfere in
Afghanistan's internal affairs, it will in reality continue to do
so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for U.S. arms
supplies to the mujahedeen.''
   The accord was praised in communist nations.
   Non-aligned communist Yugoslavia, which has repeatedly condemned
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, said the agreements represent
``an important first step which could lead to a final peace
settlement in that country.''
   In a commentary, the state Tanjug news agency said the final
solution of the conflict is still far away because the region has
been ``burdened by different international interests.''
   ``All sides involved must now show maximum goodwill,
statesman-like wisdom and responsibility,'' the Czechoslovak CTK
news agency said.
   Both Denmark and Japan said they would join a United Nations

   Finland and Sweden, both neutral Scandinavian countries, also
have agreed in principle to send observers to Afghanistan.
   Danish newspapers said Poland and Canada also have been asked to
join the force, reportedly to be led by a Finnish general.
   Japan planned to assist in the relocation of 5 million civilian
refugees, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo.
   Acting Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi said, ``Also,
it is our intention to extend financial assistance to facilitate
the safe and honorable return of the refugees to Afghanistan.''
   Britain also announced plans to aid refugees, with an $18.7
million grant for resettlement.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the grant was
conditional on the setting up of ``properly coordinated
international arrangements'' for the return of millions of Afghan
refugees from neighboring Pakistan.

   Earthquakes in southern Iran have injured
30 people and destroyed 605 homes, 17 government offices and six
mosques in two weeks, Iran's official news agency said Thursday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the
quakes around the town of Behbehan about 360 miles south of Tehran
also killed cattle and damaged crops.
   It quoted the provincial governor, who was not identified, as
saying the tremors had been rocking the region since March 30 and
``quake-stricken villagers have been settled in 1,600 tents.''
   The agency did not give the magnitude of the tremors and
provided no further details.

<HEAD>Used Condoms Collected From Sewage Plant To Test ``Safe Sex''
Advice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health workers are counting used condoms that
float to the surface of the city's sewage treatment plant pools in
an effort to find out how many people are heeding advice about safe
sex to avoid AIDS.
   Hundreds of condoms float in the water at open-air pools at
waste water treatment plants. For the last eight months, city
workers have been using long-handled fish nets to scoop the
multicolored condoms from the sewage and count them each day.
   The study, which should be completed in a year, may help
determine whether people are heeding warnings to use condoms as a
way to prevent the spread of the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome virus, officials said.
   ``We talk a lot about using condoms, but the question is whether
we're really doing it,'' said Dr. Diane Dwyer, who heads a
federally funded AIDS study in Baltimore. ``We're serious about it,
we really want to find out whether more condoms are being used, or
whether people are just buying them and storing them by the bedside
for potential future use.''
   The study includes counting the number of condoms sold at
drugstores and those given away free by the health department, Ms.
Dwyer said.
   Though officials don't know how many condoms are flushed down
toilets or simply thrown away, they said they had no intention of
going through garbage.
   ``It's certainly not a very pleasant job, but it is important,''
said Courtland Storck, the AIDS surveillance supervisor for the
health department. ``If it does work, and we hope it does, then
hopefully other cities would adapt a similar program.''
   The health department said it has so far retrieved between 200
and 400 condoms each day floating in the sewage pools.
   A Johns Hopkins Hospital doctor first suggested the study method
in Baltimore, but officials say the first such count was made in
the late 1970s in Ireland.

<HEAD>1,500 Young Jews March At Auschwitz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,500 Jewish youths, many carrying
Israeli flags, took part in a ``March of the Living'' Thursday at
the site of the Auschwitz and Birkenau death camps as Poland
honored its victims of Nazi Germany.
   In Warsaw, hundreds of academics and historians gathered at the
State Jewish Theater for a two-day conference on the struggle and
martyrdom of Jews and Poles during the 1939-45 Nazi occupation.
   The march and the conference began a week of observances of the
45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which several
hundred Jews fought a three-week battle against Hitler's army. The
uprising began April 19, 1943.
   The observance is the largest ever organized in Poland to honor
the memory of the millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust who
died on Polish soil.
   Among those attending the conference were several Polish
government ministers, senior Communist Party officials and Roman
Catholic bishops.
   Despite the somber commemorations, the chief foreign ministry
spokesman denounced Israel for violating the basic human rights of
young Palestinians demonstrating against the Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Stefan Staniszewski told a Warsaw news conference that Poland
wanted to pay homage to the Jewish ghetto fighters who ``were
Polish citizens and ... fought together with us'' against the Nazis.
   But he said ``this emotional attitude ... does not influence our
policies towards Israel.''
   ``The brutality of the repressions used by Israeli authorities
toward the Palestinian population evokes popular outrage and
condemnation around the world,'' said Staniszewski. ``We
categorically protest against the Israeli policies.''
   As light snow fell, the march began near the Auschwitz camp's
main gates, where the legend in German reads, ``Work makes you
free.''
   The blue-jacketed youths, marching behind a banner reading
``March of the Living,'' trekked two miles to the site of the
Birkenau death camp.
   There, as a cold wind whistled through the vast open field still
surrounded by double rows of barbed wire fences and wooden watch
towers, the young Jews lit a memorial flame and scattered soil from
Israel by the monument. They followed a cantor in saying Kaddish,
the Hebrew prayer for the dead.
   Auschwitz is the German name for the Polish city of Oswiecim,
where the camp was located. The monument also commemorates the camp
at Birkenau, where the Germans built huge gas chambers and
crematoria.
   In an emotional ceremony by the stark, gray international
monument honoring those who died at the two camps, Israeli
officials declared that only a strong Jewish state could prevent
another Holocaust. The marchers carried blue-and-white Israeli
flags.
   ``It is the obligation of every Jew to feel solidarity with
every other Jew,'' said Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon,
the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to visit Poland.
   ``Only by strengthening the state of Israel, multiplying and
increasing our numbers,'' can we prevail, Navon said, speaking in
Hebrew and English.
   More than 4,500 foreign visitors have come to Poland to take
part in the observances that end April 20, including some 2,000
Israelis and hundreds of Jews from the United States, Canada, Latin
America, Western Europe and Australia.
   The observances climax Tuesday, the anniversary of the outbreak
of the uprising, in which several hundred Jewish insurgents staged
a desperate three-week struggle against the final Nazi
extermination drive to liquidate the ghetto's last 75,000
inhabitants.
   One visitor to the camp's museum, Ayelet Kuper, 15, of Montreal,
Canada, said it was emotionally wrenching to look at a room full of
children's shoes taken from victims before they were murdered.
   ``And there was a small crutch, like for an 8-year old,' she
said. ``That got to me a lot.''
   More than 4 million people died at Auschwitz and Birkenau, about
70 percent of whom were Jews.

   If the United States and the Soviet Union team
up for an interplanetary mission, a trip to the moon would be
preferable to shooting for Mars, NASA Administrator James C.
FLetcher said Thursday.
   A Mars mission would probably span four or five presidential
administrations, requiring a degree of stable relations that has
not been demonstrated between the two countries, Fletcher said.
   The Soviet Union has favored a joint mission to Mars, but such a
proposal has not gone beyond the talking stage.
   Fletcher said a program of cooperative unmanned activities
should take place before astronauts and cosmonauts climb into a
space ship for the two-year round trip to Mars.
   ``Flying out to Mars together before building such a foundation
could, for several reasons, be less practical,'' he said.
   Fletcher spoke to the National Space Symposium in Colorado
Springs, Colo. on the same day that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration formally advised Congress that cutbacks in
money will delay completion of a U.S. space station for a year
until late 1996.
   The first of 16 shuttle flights needed to put men and materials
into orbit is expected to be early in 1995, instead of 1994.
   That puts the completion target date four years behind the
schedule set originally. The United States had planned to have the
space station up and working in 1992 as a celebration of the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.
   In a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate committees
that oversee NASA, FLetcher said that by revising the schedule, a
robot laboratory should operating in 1995. The laboratory had been
slated for the sixth shuttle supply mission; it now is on the
fourth.
   ``The realities of the federal budget environment are clear,''
Fletcher told Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., and Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis.
   NASA had asked for $767 million for the space station in the
current fiscal year but received $425 million. The agency wanted
$1.8 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1, but President Reagan's
budget proposes $1 billion.
   Fletcher said that left NASA three options: cutting down on the
station, changing the way the program is managed or stretching out
the time to build the station.
   The third approach ``is the only sensible way,'' Fletcher said.
More than four years and $600 million already have gone into
planning the station configuration.
   The scope of the station can't be cut further ``without
jeopardizing the safety and usefulness of the station,'' Fletcher
said. The facility, which will be home to crews of six and eight
for months at a time, originally was to cost $8 billion, but that
figure will have quadrupled when all costs _ including those of
stretch out and delays _ are taken into account.
   The European Space Agency and Japan plan to attach their own
modules to the station structure and Canada will contribute the
shuttle docking facilities.
   Fletcher called the space station a major investment in the
nation's future by providing a research and technology laboratory,
an Earth and celestial observatory, and ``a point of departure for
the expansion of human presence and activity into the solar
system.''
   In Colorado Springs, Fletcher said both the United States and
the Soviets realize that many technical unknowns are involved in a
manned Mars mission, such as the effects of prolonged
weightlessness on humans.
   The United States has experience with moon walkers, while the
Soviets have amassed data through lengthy stays on their space
stations.

<HEAD>TV Talk Show Host Morton Downey Jr. Cleared Of Assaulting Guest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``You, you, you'' _ the familiar chant of
fans of ultra-conservative Morton Downey Jr. _ rang out in a
municipal courtroom as the talk show host was cleared of charges
that he assaulted a gay rights activist during a program.
   Judge Emil DelBaglivo found Downey innocent of assaulting Andrew
Humm, a 34-year-old spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay
Rights.
   DelBaglivo watched a videotape of the show and listened to
testimony during a 4{-hour trial Wednesday before issuing his
decision.
   The 55-year-old Downey, flashed his familiar toothy grin to the
crowd after the verdict and said, ``I am very pleased.'' Downey
faced up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine had he been
convicted.
   Downey was charged with assaulting Humm Dec. 9 during the taping
of a show that involved a discussion of the role of the Catholic
Church in the modern world. The taping, at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, was
interrupted by a bomb threat, and the show was never broadcast.
   The judge said there were conflicting eyewitness accounts so the
key evidence was the 25-minute videotape.
   The tape shows Downey in a face-to-face argument with Humm.
Downey said, ``Keep your bodily fluids to yourself'' as he wiped a
small amount of spittle from his face.
   Humm said the comment about bodily fluids implied that because
he was a gay person he also had AIDS, and that his fluids were to
be feared.
   On the tape, Humm replied with an epithet, fumbled with the
microphone, and raised his right arm. Downey abruptly struck Humm's
arm away, and in doing so, he grazed Humm's face. Downey then
admonished Humm, ``Watch your language.''
   Downey's attorney, Thomas Roth of Newark, argued that the blow
did not cause pain to Humm and presented a neurologist who
testified that it would have been impossible for Humm to be injured.
   Humm testified: ``I felt humiliated, and it stung. There was no
sustained injury, but it hurt.''

   Former Mayor Jane Byrne, spurned in her last
three election bids, has signed with a New York agent and says she
will write her autobiography.
   ``There are a lot of people who would pay me a million dollars
not to write the book,'' Mrs. Byrne said Wednesday. ``I might as
well write the book.''
   Gerard McCauley, a former senior editor for Little, Brown & Co.
and Alfred A. Knopf, has been hired to represent her.
   There is ``substantial interest'' on the part of New York
publishers in a book by the former mayor, McCauley said.
   In it, Mrs. Byrne, 54, said she will discuss her tenure as mayor
from 1979 to 1983 as well as her early life, her membership in
former Mayor Richard Daley's cabinet, her association with the
Kennedy family and her roles in local, state and national
Democratic politics.
   Mrs. Byrne lost a primary race to former Mayor Harold Washington
in her bid for re-election in 1983. She lost the Democratic mayoral
primary again last year. Earlier this year, she lost a bid for the
office of clerk of the circuit courts for Cook County.

   Elizabeth Taylor is here raising money for the
battle against AIDS, but at her previous stop in Thailand she
raised the eyebrows of a politician who was quoted in local papers
as saying she was getting too much attention.
   Thailand's Nation newspaper, reporting Thursday about a Monday
luncheon in Bangkok for the actress, said that Premier Prem
Tinsulanonda ``could hardly contain his excitement and even asked
what colors the American actress would be wearing, according to
government spokesman Mechai Viravaidya.''
   Then the Bangkok Post newspaper quoted former Prime Minister
Kukrit Pramoj, a frequent, biting critic of Prem, as saying in a
meeting with reporters Wednesday that he felt ``slighted'' by the
attention Prem gave to Ms. Taylor.
   ``I am also a Hollywood actor, but he pays no special attention
to me,'' Kukrit said. ``I was the first Thai to star in a movie
with Marlon Brando.''
   Kukrit, 76, was referring to his appearance in the 1959 movie
``The Ugly American.''
   ``What is so good about Elizabeth Taylor?'' he continued. ``She
has had seven husbands. How can you hold her up publicly?''
   Kukrit said ``if Thai women take her example and have seven
husbands,'' government spokesman Mechai, who is also a pioneer in
family planning in Thailand, ``would hang himself.''
   Ms. Taylor has been married to six different men. She was twice
married to actor Richard Burton.
   During her stay in Bangkok, Ms. Taylor denied rumors she was
going to marry American publisher Malcolm Forbes, who was traveling
with her party.
   And in Tokyo, Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that Ms.
Taylor had met Thursday with Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita at his
official residence and had also gotten a pledge of a $10,000
contribution to the American Foundation for AIDS Research from
Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.

<HEAD>Plane Crash Blamed on Crew, Air Traffic Control Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash of an Aeroflot passenger jet in February
in which 20 people died was blamed on errors by the crew and an air
traffic controller, investigators said.
   A report on the investigation of the crash in the Siberian city
of Surgut, 1,400 miles from Moscow, was published Wednesday by the
official news agency Tass.
   The state Civil Aircraft Flght Safety Commission said the pilot
of the Tupolev-134 asked for permission to use a runway not
normally used at the Surgut airport and tried to land the craft in
poor visibility.
   The official report said the plane carried 45 passengers and a
crew of six. Seventeen passengers and three crew members were
killed, and all of the other 31 people aboard were injured.
   ``Since the commander did not stick to the flight parameters set
by the air traffic controller, the plane found itself in a
position, as to the landing strip, which made safe landing
impossible,'' the report said.
   ``The plane therefore made a rough landing away from the landing
strip, it was wrecked by overloads and burst into flames,'' Tass
said.
   The report said co-pilot V. Shuneiko was flying the plane, while
commander A. Shavrovich was talking with the air traffic controller
about switching runways.
   ``Flight director V. Maltsev met the crew's request, but in
doing so, in violation of the rules, he failed to switch on ground
radio facilities for a landing approach and organize observation of
weather in the direction of the landing course,'' Tass said.
   The plane was on a 1,600-mile flight across the western Soviet
Union when it crashed at its final stop.
   Rescue operations were impaired by poorly trained personnel and
insufficient technical facilities at Surgut, the report said.
   ``By the results of the investigation, the Ministry of Civil
Aviation is taking necessary steps to rule out a recurrence of such
aircraft accidents,'' the report said, but did not give details.

   A state Senate committee, reversing the stand it
took last year, voted 5-4 Thursday to approve a Martin Luther King
holiday for Arizona.
   The issue has been a source of national controversy since
then-Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded a holiday that his predecessor had
proclaimed without legislative approval.
   The sponsor of the measure, Democrat Carolyn Walker of Phoenix,
said she was confident the full Senate and House will approve the
bill if it gets through the Senate's Republican majority caucus.
The House passed a similar measure 35-25 last year.
   Government Committee Chairman John Mawhinney of Tucson and
Republican member Carol Macdonald of Safford switched their votes.
Mrs. Macdonald did not explain her reasons, but Mawhinney said he
felt it was time to provide spiritual as well as physical help to
those in need.
   The bill is virtually identical to last year's and would conform
Arizona's practice to the federal government's. Instead of being
called a King holiday, the new day off would be known as Martin
Luther King Jr.-Civil Rights Day, however. And instead of being
known as Presidents Day, the combined Lincoln and Washington
holidays would be known as George Washington-Abraham Lincoln Day.
   Mecham was removed by a Senate court of impeachment earlier this
month, and his successor, Gov. Rose Mofford, sent her chief of
staff to the committee Thursday to join religious, union and
tourism industry officials in urging passage of the bill.
   The measure would combine the holidays for George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln into a single February holiday and create a January
holiday for King.
   Although Mecham said that he rescinded the proclaimed holiday on
the advice of Attorney General Bob Corbin and that his Democratic
predecessor, Gov. Bruce Babbitt, usurped a legislative prerogative
in ordering state money spent on a holiday, the action generated an
international controversy.
   Starting with a march of more than 10,000 people on the state
Capitol, the unrest dogged Mecham for the remainder of his term. He
was removed from office April 4 _ the 20th anniversary of King's
assassination _ through a Senate impeachment conviction.

   Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder, whose
remarks about black athletes during a television interview cost him
his CBS commentary job, is back in the hospital for tests and
observation after complaining of chest pains.
   The 70-year-old oddsmaker was in good condition, Miami Heart
Institute spokeswoman Esther Saporito said Thursday.
   Snyder, dismissed from ``NFL Today'' in January, said he woke up
in his hotel room here Wednesday with chest pains.
   ``I don't take any chances, the sooner they can do something for
you the better,'' he said from his hospital bed. ``They (doctors)
are just looking to see what they find.''
   He said he was undergoing a series of tests, such as
electrocardiograms, and hoped to be hospitalized ``no longer than
the weekend.'' Snyder was hospitalized last July at Duke Medical
Center in Durham, N.C., where examinations disclosed that an artery
to his heart was blocked, and again shortly after his January
firing.
   Synder has stood by his controversial comments about the
superiority of black athletes made on WRC-TV in Washington. He and
others had been asked to comment about the progress of blacks in
society in commemoration of Martin Luther King's birthday.
   Within two days of the interview, CBS fired the 12-year veteran
of ``NFL Today.'' After his hospitalization in Durham, where he
lives with his wife, Joan, Snyder took up residence alone at the
posh, oceanfront Alexander Hotel on Miami Beach.
   ``I've been hiding there for 2{ months and then this had to
happen,'' said Snyder, adding that he didn't feel ``too good right
now.''

   Mayor Bernie Simon, who died Thursday after
battling cancer for a year, was eulogized by friends and colleagues
as a common man and a hero who enjoyed a love affair with his city.
   Simon, 60, was taken to Methodist Hospital from his home at 4:50
a.m. after his wife, Betty, realized he wasn't breathing. City
officials said Simon was dead on arrival.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death.
   Council member Walt Calinger said the mayor ``learned not to
give up and fought hard until the end. At a time when we worry
about not having heroes and not having role models, Bernie was a
hero.''
   Simon, who replaced Mayor Mike Boyle when Boyle was recalled
last year, was stricken with cancer two months after taking office.
He was hospitalized off and on for treatment but kept up a full
schedule at City Hall until last month.
   When he was released from a hospital stay earlier this month,
his doctor denied he was dying and said he expected the mayor to
return to work within two weeks.
   Fellow politicians described Simon on Thursday as someone who
gave others the courage to live.
   ``If you were to ask me about Bernie, only two words would come
to mind _ courage and leadership,'' said Acting Mayor Fred Conley,
who took over for Simon temporarily last month.
   As recently as 10 days ago, Conley said, Simon showed him
pictures of his grandchildren and said he was planning a party to
celebrate his return to office.
   ``He had been very positive and upbeat about his cancer. He
thought he had a good chance of beating it,'' Conley said.
   Gov. Kay Orr called him ``a man of peace and concord. He loved
being mayor. He loved serving the people, and in public service he
gave the very essence of his nature, a spirit of unity which
brought the people of Omaha together.''
   ``He was really just a common guy that sincerely wanted, not for
himself, but for the city of Omaha to be successful during his
term,'' council member Steve Tomasak said.
   Simon, a Democrat, was first elected to the City Council in
1981. He was named mayor Feb. 3, 1987, after Boyle was recalled, to
serve the remaining 2{ years of Boyle's term.
   Simon had said becoming mayor was a lifelong dream. But after
taking office, he was diagnosed as having an inoperable tumor in
his lung. That tumor was destroyed during treatment, but two more
tumors were later found in his brain.
   ``Don't look so gloomy,'' he told reporters at the time. ``I've
whipped cancer before and I'm going to whip this one.''
   Radiation treatments and chemotherapy reduced the tumors, but
weakened by treatment, Simon was stricken with shingles on his eyes
and became mentally disoriented.
   Conley said at a City Hall news conference that he would
continue as acting mayor until the council meets after Simon's
funeral to choose a new mayor.
   A native of Omaha, Simon graduated from Creighton Preparatory
High School in 1945 and then served briefly in the U.S. Navy before
the end of World War II.
   He worked as a telephone lineman, later moving up to marketing
manager before retiring from the telephone company in 1981.
   ``I'm not ready to sit down in a rocking chair,'' Simon said
when he took over as mayor. ``It's a zest for life.''
   Survivors include his wife, three sons, a daughter, and six
grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Falwell Approves Swaggart Penalties, Doesn't Want Minister in
White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLL MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Jerry Falwell said Thursday he
welcomed tough measures taken against fallen TV minister Jimmy
Swaggart and said that America is not ready for a Pat Robertson or
Jesse Jackson in the White House.
   ``I have no problem with Reverend Jackson running, as long as he
loses,'' Falwell said.
   ``I don't think the American people want a reverend _ it has
nothing to do with Democrat, Republican, black, white, liberal,
conservative. I don't think the American people are ready for a
reverend to be in the White House, and I think it's a pretty good
idea one never is.''
   Falwell's comments came as part of a panel discussion on
televangelists on the second day of a three-day convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   An estimated 685 editors attending the convention also heard
from Jackson and his fellow Democratic presidential hopeful, Albert
Gore, as well as from House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for
his efforts to end fighting in Central America.
   Falwell said he was pleased that television representatives in
the National Religious Broadcasters had agreed to recommend that
all Christian stations drop Swaggart's religious program if he
returns to preaching before his one-year suspension expires.
   ``That doesn't mean all the stations have to comply with that
requirement,'' Falwell said. ``But my guess is that most of them
will.''
   Falwell, along with panelists Jeffrey K. Hadden, sociology
professor at the University of Virginia, and Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune
reporter Mary Hargrove, told the editors that the sex scandals that
brought down Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker marked the end
of an era for televangelists.
   ``We're witnessing a serious readjustment of the work of
religious politics,'' Hadden said.
   ``The questions about financial accountability already had been
raised. The sex scandals were the final icing on the cake,''
Hargrove said.
   Falwell said he believes ``it was inevitable that these
catastrophies occurred'' and said it was not the press that brought
down the Bakkers and Swaggart. ``They brought themselves down.''
   ``Frankly,'' he said, ``an inevitable housecleaning was overdue.
Yes, it's hurt everybody ... but the major hurt is the terrible
damage done to the value systems and the principle systems of young
people in this country.''
   Falwell, who took over the debt-ridden PTL ministry after the
Bakkers' departure and resigned from it late last year, said one
good thing had come out of the Bakker-Swaggart sex scandals: the
end of televangelists' celebrity status.
   ``There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a person
that people look to as God. Celebrity status is history.''
   Earlier in the day, the editors heard a plea from Wright to
cover all the details of a comprehensive trade bill now before
Congress. He called the measure one of the most important now on
Capitol Hill.
   ``You hold the keys to developing thoughtful commentary on
events,'' Wright said.

   The chairman of a House appropriations panel
on Thursday called for suspension of U.S. aid to its three poorest
NATO allies, and stormed out of a hearing to protest the
administration's failure to produce details of previous assistance
to the countries.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the subcommittee on foreign
operations, told State and Defense Department witnesses he was
``fed up with getting this mush from you. You must really think
we're saps up here.''
   He then suspended the hearing after only 50 minutes and strode
out of the room.
   ``There was no sense in my sitting listening for the information
only to be told they they didn't have it,'' Obey told the AP later.
``That was the same thing they said before.''
   At the root of the dispute are demands by Congress that other
NATO members spend more money on the defense of the alliance, in
what is known as ``burden sharing.''
   Obey's outburst was prompted by the administration's failure to
provide the committee with detailed lists of the surplus military
equipment being transferred to Greece, Turkey and Portugal this
year.
   Obey said he had asked for the lists several months ago to help
the committee decide how to allocate funds for the administration's
1989 spending request of $1.4 billion for the three countries,
where the United States maintains military bases and some 15,000
personnel.
   The three are the poorest members of NATO, and the
administration contends the United States must fund them in order
to ensure continued basing rights.
   Obey, a vocal foe of U.S. spending on NATO allies, said the
United States should not ``be engaged in unilateral welfare
efforts'' for these countries. Rather, he said, the aid should be a
joint NATO effort.
   ``My view is that there should be zero funding this year for
base rights countries,'' he said.
   Obey claimed that taxpayers in Athens, Wis., are paying more for
the defense of Greece than those in Athens, Greece. ``My taxpayers
are fed up with this, and so am I.''
   The U.S. taxpayer spends more than $1,000 a year on the defense
of the free world, while British taxpayers spend per capita $488,
the French $511, the West Germans $433 and the Japanese $163, Obey
said. ``We're being taken for a ride.''
   Obey railed against such NATO members as West Germany ``who
constantly lecture us on our deficit and on managing our economy''
but fail to share the burden of maintaining the U.S. presence in
Europe.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Thomas, defending
the administration's spending request _ which is 41 percent higher
than the base rights funding of 1981 _ said U.S. interests clearly
lie in a continued U.S. presence in Europe. ``Our border begins
there,'' he said.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense John A. Woodworth said in
his testimony that while U.S. defense spending grew much more than
that of other NATO members in the years between 1981 and 1986,
``that pattern is now reversed.''
   He said several NATO countries, among them Italy, Greece,
Norway, Spain and Turkey, increased their defense spending by about
3 percent in 1987, while the U.S. increase was only 0.1 percent and
in 1988 it will decline more than 3 percent.

   The Soviet Union signed a formal pledge Thursday
to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan starting May 15, but there
was no indication from guerrillas that the Red Army will be allowed
to leave peacefully after eight years of war.
   Moslem insurgent leaders, who were not invited to the
negotiations, said they would present their reaction Saturday at a
rally in Pakistan.
   The U.S.-supported guerrillas, who claim to control virtually
all the country except the cities, ere expected to repeat their vow
to continue fighting until the last Soviet soldier has left Afghan
soil.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and neighboring
Pakistan, signed the accord Thursday in an austere 10-minute
ceremony. It stipulates that the withdrawal begin May 15.
   Afterward, Pakistan, which represented the guerrillas at the
negotiations, predicted the civil war will go on because there is
no provision for an interim government, and said it would continue
denying recognition to the Communist regime in Kabul.
   Provisions of the agreement require the two countries to stop
interfering in one another's affairs. The insurgents, who have been
fighting since a Communist coup in April 1978, are based in camps
and cities on Pakistan's side of the borde  23.00 23.00 23.00 22.97

   The director of a New York scholarship
program that withdrew its award to an Oral Roberts University
student says the student's choice of college had nothing to do with
the $3,000 grant being taken back.
   But John Kearse, executive director of the Economic Opportunity
Commission of Nassau County, N.Y., told the Tulsa World in a story
for Thursday's editions that future recipients of the scholarships
will be required to attend ``black universities.''
   The Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship, sponsored by the EOC,
was taken away from Karen Warren, 19, of Hempstead, N.Y., in
October 1987, two months after she began classes at Oral Roberts
University. EOC officials said at the time that the scholarship was
rescinded because the high school Miss Warren attended did not have
an EOC-sponsored community action program.
   The Rev. Earl Mitchell, Miss Warren's pastor, responded that the
scholarship was withdrawn ``because John Kearse objects to Karen's
religious beliefs and those of ORU.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge who was the Justice
Department's antitrust chief testified Thursday before a grand jury
investigating conflict-of-interest allegations against Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg apparently was questioned
about Meese's role in formulating Justice Department policy on the
breakup of American Telephone & Telgraph Co. stock at a time when
the attorney general owned telephone stock.
   Ginsburg, who headed the antitrust division in 1985 and 1986,
presumably was asked about his knowledge of meetings Meese had with
executives of four of the seven regional telephone companies formed
by the 1984 breakup of AT&T.
   Meese meetings with executives of the so-called Baby Bell
companies when he and his wife owned 91 shares of Baby Bell stock
is being investigated by independent counsel James C. McKay for
possible conflict-of-interest violations.
   As of April 1, McKay said there was insufficient evidence to
bring criminal charges against the attorney general in connection
with the Baby Bell stock or other matters still under investigation.
   But the investigation is expected to continue until month's end,
when McKay is prepared to issue a report if he does not bring
charges.
   At the time of their meetings with Meese, officials of the Baby
Bells were seeking a modification of the 1984 decree that would
allow them to manufacture telephone equipment and offer
long-distance and computer services.
   In an about-face last year, the Justice Department urged U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene to allow the Baby Bells to expand
their operations to include equipment manufacturing, long-distance
and computer services.
   The Meeses sold their shares in the Baby Bell stock for $14,000
last summer.
   Greene denied most of the request by the government and the Baby
Bells, except that he allowed the regional companies to perform
some types of information services.
   Before joining the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here in late
1986, Ginsburg had been assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, Previously, he had been the No. 2 official in
the division.
   There was no immediate comment from the judge's chambers about
Ginsburg's testimony.
   Last year, he was nominated to a vacancy on the Supreme Court
but withdrew his name from consideration following reports that he
had once used marijuana and allegations of possible
conflict-of-interest arising from his ownership of stock in a
company that is one of the largest operators of cable television
systems.
   A preliminary inquiry conducted by the Justice Department
examined 16 instances in which Ginsburg dealt with cable industry
issues while holding the stock, but determined that either his
participation or chance of gain was too minimal to violate
conflict-of-interest laws.

<TEXT>
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited the
home of her Chinese ancestors on Thursday, while her nation
remained her nation was on full military alert amid concerns of a
coup attempt during her absence.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno played down the threat of
a coup attempt at home, despite the escape from prison of former
Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, who tried to overthrow the president in
August.
   ``Mr. Honasan has lost all capability of mounting any serious
threat on the government,'' Benigno said. ``If there was any
question about that, then the president would have wavered in her
decision to come to China, but not for one minute did she waver in
her plans.''
   The president, accompanied by seven cabinet ministers, was
greeted by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing and taken to the
Diaoyutai State Guest House, where she will stay during her
three-day visit to China.
   On Friday she will be officially welcomed by President Yang
Shangkun outside the Great Hall of the People and will hold talks
with Premier Li Peng. She is also to sign a trade protocol and a
science and technology agreement.
   Mrs. Aquino is also to meet senior leader Deng Xiaoping on
Saturday before leaving for an overnight stay in Hong Kong.
   In Fujian province, Mrs. Aquino visited her ancestral village of
Hongjian. Mrs. Aquino's great-grandfather, Xu Yuhuan, lived there
until leaving for the Philippines 120 years ago.
   Village residents waved yellow banners and Chinese and
Philippine flags and set off firecrackers while a school band
played. Crowds lined the roads passing through fertile, terraced
farmland.
   At the Xu family ancestral temple, which had been restored and
painted for the visit, Mrs. Aquino burned incense and bowed three
times before memorial tablets.
   ``I came to China for reasons of state and for reasons personal
to me, for I am both head of state of my country and, in a way, a
daughter of this village,'' she told 49 relatives she was meeting
for the first time.
   ``The end of traveling, we are told, is to return. I have
returned for my family, and for other Filipinos of Chinese descent,
to retrace their steps and attain some understanding of the
industry and creativity that led them forth to new beginnings in
other lands,'' she said.
   She ended the speech by saying in Chinese, ``I and my daughters
and my colleagues again thank you for your welcome which we will
never forget.'
   Mrs. Aquino visited a kindergarten where she gave yellow ``Cory
Aquino'' T-shirts to the children and looked at family photos in
the home of an uncle, Xu Yuanxiang. Her visit to Hongjian lasted a
little more than an hour.
   Fujian Gov. Wang Zhaoguo hosted Mrs. Aquino at a lavish banquet
and thanked the president for her gift to Hongjian of a playground,
to be built with $15,000 in donations by Philippine businessmen.
   The Philippine military was put on full alert nationwide, and
opposition leaders suggested she should scrub the trip to China
because of political unrest at home. Mrs. Aquino's last trip abroad
was in November 1986 to Japan.
   She said that canceling the trip would be ``the greatest folly''
because she wanted to show China ``that we have at least achieved
the internal political stability and peace to play a responsible
and important role that is expected of us in Asian affairs.''

   A revival of Mighty Mouse cartoons, a
junior high school drama and three shows on the Constitution's
anniversary were among 23 programs honored by a children's
television advocacy group Thursday.
   Action for Children's Television presented its annual
achievement awards to radio and video programs from Boston to
Portland, Ore., at its 20th anniversary celebration.
   ``These are programs that have something special to pat them on
their back,'' said Peggy Charren, who founded the 15,000-member
organization that monitors children's programming. ``This is what
children need and deserve from TV.''
   Among the winners in the commercial television category was the
updated ``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' by animator Ralph
Bakshi, who created the 1971 feature-length ``adult'' cartoon
``Fritz the Cat.''
   ```Mighty Mouse' is TV animation the way it used to be,''
Charren said. ``It's not trying to sell something and it has
something to say to children even while it's showing Mighty Mouse
come to save the day.''
   The cartoon originally appeared on television from 1955 to about
1966.
   ``It doesn't talk down to children,'' said Bakshi, 48, who also
made ``The Lord of the Rings'' and ``Heavy Traffic'' in the 1970s.
``I wanted to make sure the level of writing was not below an adult
level.''
   ACT had a separate award category for programs about the 200th
anniversary of the Constitution. Among the winners was CBS' ``The
Day They Came To Arrest the Book,'' based on a story by journalist
Nat Hentoff about attempts to ban Mark Twain's novel ``Huckleberry
Finn.''
   In public television, ACT gave an award to ``Degrassi Junior
High'' from WGBH in Boston, which it called ``a stimulating TV
series on adolescents in action.''
   But Charren said the 1987-88 awards reflected a dearth of news
programming for children, citing the demise of CBS's ``In the
News'' and other news shows in the last year. ACT last fall began
campaigning for an increase in news for children.
   ``It's so important because this is the information that kids
need so that when they to be 18 they can vote,'' Charren said.
``You can't pick that up from the kinds of newscasts kids listen
to.''
   Charren also criticized commercial broadcasters for caving in to
promotional interests and ratings, saying that from 1984-87 about
70 Saturday morning children's shows featured characters based on
toys.
   The ACT award recipients were:
   Public television: ``Degrassi Junior High,'' WGBH-TV, Boston;
``Wonderworks,'' WQED, Pittsburgh; ``Square One TV,'' Children's
Television Workshop.
   Commercial television: ``Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures,''
Bakshi-Hyde Ventures; ``Young Universe,'' Behrens Productions Inc.;
``Popcorn,'' KATU, Portland, Ore.; ``The Kidsongs TV Show,''
Together Again Productions; ``Rap-Around,'' WBZ-TV, Boston;
``Newsbag,'' WTTG, Washington, D.C.
   Radio: Ainsley Communications for KPAL-AM, Little Rock, Ark.
   Cable Television: ``Kids & Books,'' Continental Cablevision of

   Real estate mogul Harry Helmsley and his ``hotel
queen'' wife Leona, one of the world's wealthiest couples, loudly
asserted their innocence Thursday as they were arraigned in an
alleged $4 million tax scam.
   ``Not guilty,'' both replied in strong voices to charges in a
188-count state indictment accusing them of hiding millions of
dollars in renovations on their Connecticut mansion as business
expenses.
   ``The fact is they did not pay millions of dollars in income
tax,'' said U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in announcing a 47-count
federal indictment against the Helmsleys on similar charges. He
noted the charges were announced the day before federal income tax
returns are due.
   The Helmsleys were joined in pleading innocent to the state
charges by Frank Turco, 45, of Lutz, Fla., Mrs. Helmsley's former
top aide, and Joseph Licari, 51, of Oyster Bay Cove, the couple's
former financial manager.
   Both also were named in the federal indictment, which contained
similar charges. That indictment also accused Mrs. Helmsley and
Turco of extortion conspiracy; they allegedly received kickbacks by
threatening suppliers with a cutoff of Helmsley business and by
threatening Helmsley employees with loss of their jobs.
   The Helmsleys, whose holdings include the Empire State Building
and the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are estimated to be worth at least
$1.4 billion.
   According to the indictments, the Helmsleys spent approximately
$4 million to refurbish the mansion with an enclosure for one of
the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on
the roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo
system; more than $370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of
furniture and paintings.
   In addition, a $45,000 birthday present for Helmsley _ a clock
in the shape of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue _ was billed
to and paid by the Park Lane Hotel in December 1984, it said. And
four jade art objects worth $500,000 were paid for by four New York
City hotels as furniture purchases in 1984, the charges said.
   Prior to their arraignment, the Helmsleys were booked and
fingerprinted at Police Headquarters ``like anybody else. They
received no special treatment whatsoever,'' said state Attorney
General Robert Abrams, who announced the state indictment.
   Later, in court, the Helmsleys sat quietly in the front row as
alleged drug dealers and thieves were arraigned. They spoke from
time to time. Helmsley, 79, wore a brown suit and cashmere coat.
Mrs. Helmsley, 67, in a long red coat-dress with a blue collar,
appeared depressed; her mascara had run.
   State prosecutors requested $1 million bail each for the
Helmsleys, with $100,000 bail for their aides. But acting state
Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman released them on their own
recognizance pending a June 1 court date.
   All four are due in U.S. District Court on April 21 for
arraignment on the federal charges.
   The state indictment against each defendant included 139 counts
of falsifying business records; 44 counts of offering a false
instrument for filing; three counts of scheme to defraud; one count
of conspiracy; and one misdemeanor count of scheme to defraud.
   The indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and
1986.
   The charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy, income
tax evasion, filing false and fraudulent income tax returns, mail
fraud and, for Mrs. Helmsley and Turco, conspiracy to commit
extortion.
   The maximum fine and prison term on conviction of the charges is
unclear. Each state felony count carries with it up to four years
in prison and a $500,000 fine; the federal counts carry sentences
of up to five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.
   The extortion conspiracy count, however, can bring up to 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who is prominent in ads for a string of hotels,
recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who said they would
not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if she pleaded guilty
to fraud, a source has said.
   Giuliani, at the news conference, also congratulated the New
York Post for its investigative reporting involving the Helmsleys'
finances. The Post, over the last 15 months, ran a series of
articles about the couple.
   As many as 30 past and current employees of the Helmsley
organization reportedly were given immunity from prosecution in
return for testimony before state and federal grand juries;
Giuliani refused to comment on that.

   An Egyptian-American released after eight days as
a hostage said the Islamic radicals who seized a Kuwait Airways
jumbo jet overlooked his U.S. driver's license.
   ``One of them searched my wallet, and there was my driver's
license,'' Ramadan Ali said during an interview at the home of a
relative in Kuwait. ``I was so lucky. He didn't realize what it
was.''
   Ali was one of 12 passengers freed Tuesday night shortly before
the hijackers of the Boeing 747 flew from Cyprus to Algeria with
more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard.
   Fearful the hijackers would harm him if they knew of his U.S.
citizenship, Ali said he hid his U.S. passport in his briefcase and
used his Egyptian documents.
   When the jet stopped in Iran immediately after the hijacking,
``they collected al our briefcases and put them in a closet and
closed it,'' he said.
   For the rest of his captivity, he said he worried that one might
search his case and discover the document, ``but they had no time
to do it.''
   Ali, who displayed bruises on his wrists, said the hijackers
used plastic handcuffs on the passengers after two days in Iran and
left them on constantly after that.
   ``Clamping your hands 24 hours _ You have to eat, your hand is
tied; go the the bathroom, your hand is tied,'' he said.
   The eight-day ordeal left him nervous, emotionally stunned and
wary of flying, Ali said.
   ``It became to me like a phobia,'' he said. ``It could happen
again.''
   He withheld his American address because ``these guys, they have
long hands.''
   Ali, a consulting engineer who travels widely, said security at
Bangkok airport was loose, ``like a farmer's market.''
   He said he saw passengers who set off alarms on metal detectors
pass unsearched as he was boarding the flight for Kuwait.
   He agreed with other passengers' reports that the hijackers
appeared to take on weapons and two new colleagues during four days
at Mashhad airport in Iran, their first stop.
   But he said he did not actually see any weapons or new men come
aboard. He said screens were drawn across the first-class cabin
where the hijackers stayed and all the aircraft's window shades
were pulled down.
   ``After we left Mashhad, I saw three machine guns,'' which he
said were small weapons resembling the Israeli-made Uzi.
   He said he also saw 10 hand grenades, thick ropes, explosives
and plastic hand grenades only after the plane had been in Mashhad.
He said two new hijackers appeared to join the six younger ones
when the plane was in Iran. He described the newcomers as older
men, 30 to 40, who were giving orders to the others.
   One by one, he said, they called passengers to the front
compartments to question them about their jobs, nationalities,
families and religion.
   He said the people called forward most often were the two
Kuwaitis who were shot to death in Cyprus, although passengers did
not know of the killings until their release.
   Ali said the hijackers also asked the branch of Islam he
belonged to: Sunni or Shiite.
   All of the Kuwaiti men released so far have been Shiites,
members of the branch that predominates in Iran and southern
Lebanon, but is a minority in most of the Islamic world.
   ``I was reading the Koran all the time. They noticed I'm a
religious person,'' he said, speculating that might have helped in
his release.
   He said he tried to pray and that others tried to join in. But
he said the attempt to practice standard Islamic prayers, which
require standing, then kneeling toward Mecca, made the hijackers
nervous.
   ``They said, `Hey guys, if you want to pray, pray in your
seats.'''

   The violent, realistic gang drama ``Colors''
opens Friday at 425 theaters across the country amid a debate
between its critics and its makers over whether the film will
inspire more youth violence.
   A spokesman for one group of law enforcement officers says the
movie will ``leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the
other,'' but the filmmakers say the film is a statement of
conscience and will save lives.
   ``This is not the right time to release a movie like this,''
said Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden. Since April 4, there
have been 89 gang-related deaths in Los Angeles city and county;
last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths in the area.
   ``If there is anything this picture does not do _ it does not
glorify gangs or gang violence,'' said Charles O. Glenn, executive
vice president for the distributor, New York-based Orion Pictures.
   In New York on Thursday, six members of the Guardian Angels, a
community anti-crime group, were arrested during a protest outside
Orion headquarters. The group planned a protest later Thursday in
Los Angeles.
   The movie, starring Sean Penn and Rubert Duvall as gang-fighting
Los Angeles policemen, was directed by Dennis Hopper and used
active area gang members as extras and advisers. The film portrays
the world of the Crips and the Bloods, rival gangs, who use the
colors blue and red, respectively, to distinguish themselves.
   It was made with the ``technical advice, assistance and
cooperation of the LAPD, its anti-gang CRASH unit, the Sheriff's
Department of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Probation
Department,'' Glenn said.
   But it has drawn strong criticism from some police, city
officials, the NAACP, community leaders and the Guardian Angels.
   Wes McBride, president of the California Gang Investigators
Association, believes ``Colors'' will ``leave dead bodies from one
end of this town to the other.''
   ``A release of this film may tip the scale in such a way that
will only result in more loss of young lives,'' said Willis
Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP chapter.
   ``I think the people who are making those predictions are
whipping up the probability and the possibility,'' of violence,
Hopper said. ``The people who are saying blood is going to flow in
the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets. I think
it's very irresponsible behavior.''
   About 70 theaters in the Los Angeles area alone plan to show
``Colors.'' Many critics called on theaters to cancel the movie.
   The downtown Laemmle Grand did just that. ``The staff at the
theater were in a panic because the home turf of one of the gangs
in the movie is just a couple of miles from downtown,'' said Bob
Laemmle, theater chain co-owner.
   But Joel Maliniak, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, said: ``Officials should be finding
solutions to the gang problem rather than prohibiting something
from being shown.''
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said he believes the movie will
galvanize support for the county's war on gangs.
   At a celebrity showing Wednesday night, which drew Cher, Marlee
Matlin, Richard Dean Anderson, Bono Hewson and Emilio Estevez, 10
members of the Guardian Angels marched and chanted ``Don't Show
`Colors.'''
   ``There is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a
gang,'' said Hopper, who also attended the VIP showing.
   Five Guardian Angels were arrested Tuesday when they tried to
force their way into Orion's Los Angeles offices. The Angels,
including group founder Curtis Sliwa who has called the movie
``racist and irresponsible,'' were arrested for investigation of
battery after allegedly pushing and tackling security guards.
   ``We feel that `Colors' is an honest and socially responsible
portrayal of a problem that obviously exists in Los Angeles and in
the streets of every other American city,'' Glenn said.
   He called ``Colors'' a ``significant work by filmmakers of
substance and integrity,'' and likened it to statement movies made
in the past, including ``Gentleman's Agreement'' about
anti-Semitism, ``I Am a Fugitive from A Chain Gang'' about legal
injustice, ``Platoon'' about the futility of combat and ``On the
Waterfront'' about waterfront gangs.

   Stock prices and the dollar plunged and interest
rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade
deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped about
101 points, while in the currency markets the value of the dollar
fell 2 percent against major currencies. Interest rates on a key
long-term U.S. Treasury bond jumped to a three-month high.
   Traders scrambled to sell dollars, bonds and stocks after the
Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's trade
deficit had risen to $13.8 billion in February. That was the
biggest shortfall since the record of $17.6 billion in October and
the second monthly increase in a row. Many economists had been
expecting the deficit to narrow.
   The Dow Jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of
the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange then stabilized for
a few hours. But the slide resumed in the afternoon and the average
skidded to a 101.46-point loss at 2,005.63, a 4.8 percent drop,
according to a prelimary calculation.
   It was the worst decline since the Dow plunged 140.58 points on
Jan. 8.
   The Dow's decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of
computerized program trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the
first time the ``collar'' has been triggered by a decline of 50
points or more in the Dow.
   The dollar was down about 1.9 percent against the British pound,
about 1.9 percent against the West German mark and about 2.2
percent against the Japanese yen at midafternoon.
   The impact also was felt in the bond market, an important
barometer of the economy and interest rates. By late afternoon,
prices of the key 30-year Treasury bond were down 1\ points, or
about $12.50 for every $1,000 in face amount, and its yield, which
moves inversely to price, surged to 8.855 percent, the highest in
three months.

   Conservatives opened a drive against the new
U.S.-Soviet arms treaty on Thursday and former Defense Secretary
Caspar W. Weinberger said he had no reason to believe the pact bans
futuristic weapons such as lasers.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., vowed once more
not to call up the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty for
debate on the Senate floor until the futuristic weapons issue is
cleared up.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee convened a secret session to
discuss the issue, which Byrd has said may represent ``a hole in
the treaty.''
   Although there has been pressure on the Senate to complete work
on the pact before President Reagan leaves for his Moscow summit
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in late May, Byrd
told reporters: ``I'm not driven by a calendar deadline. I want
first, last and always to have a good treaty.''
   The treaty makes no specific mention of futuristic weapons such
as lasers or particle beam generators that may be used in a U.S.
Star Wars defense, but Reagan administration negotiators have said
the Soviet Union understands the treaty does bar the possession or
flight testing of all medium-range weapons, no matter how they are
armed or operate.
   Weinberger, in a letter, told Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind.: ``I
can simply state that there was no understanding of any kind that I
knew about that the treaty covered anything related to these
so-called futuristic weapons.''
   A similar letter was received from Kenneth Adelman, former head
of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   Weinberger said: ``Certainly, there was no discussion or
evaluation of the military sufficiency questions involved in
banning futuristic weaponry that I ever participated in, and I
never heard any others having such a discussion.''
   He said it was his clear understanding U.S. negotiators were
talking only about existing types of medium-range ballistic or
cruise missiles.
   ``Indeed, had their been any suggestions that `futuristic'
weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongest
possible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effect
on (the Strategic Defense Initiative) for us to agree to any
limitation on any systems not yet designed or `futuristic'
systems,'' Weinberger said.
   He said such a ban also would heve enabled the Soviets ``to
argue that they have finally succeeded in making our SDI efforts
ineffective.''
   Adelman also said he was never aware of a ban on futuristic
weapons ever being discussed in any National Security Council
meeting he attended or in ``any meeting with Soviet officials with
which I am familiar.''
   Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus,
announced the opening of a nationwide campaign to defeat the treaty
or to delay Senate consent to its ratification.
   Treaty supporters have said they can count only a handful of
senators firmly committed to vote against the pact. Ratification
requires a two-thirds vote, 67 senators if all 100 are present.
   Phillips told reporters that black umbrellas emblazoned with
anti-treaty slogans would be delivered to the offices of all 100
senators to symbolize the beginning of a campaign in which he said
organizers would attempt to rally public opinion against the pact.
   In a letter accompanying the umbrellas, Phillips gave this
explanation:
   ``Open, the unbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, for
more than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination and
intimidation of Europe.
   ``Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of
appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized (British
Prime Minister) Neville Chamberlain's dealings with Adolph Hitler
at Munich precisely 50 years ago.''
   Phillips said conservative groups would purchase television time
to present a 30-minute film attacking the treaty and were sending
letters to 250,000 conservative activists to begin a grassroots
campaign.
   The INF treaty requires the destruction of all U.S. and Soviet
missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   The U.S. force of Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and
ground-launched cruise missiles was deployed several years ago to
counter the Soviet deployment of medium-range SS-20 missiles.

   Lior, a 13-year-old Israeli, and Salam, a
12-year-old Palestinian, didn't agree on much, but an editor who
published their letter exchange in his newspaper said it was the
start of a fresh dialogue.
   ``If our generation failed to communicate, maybe this young
generation can do a better job,'' said Othman Hallak, editor of the
An Nahar newspaper. Hallak is known for his moderate pro-Jordanian
views.
   An Nahar on Wednesday published a two-page missive by Lior Kay
from Tel Aviv who called for an end to rioting, criticized Arab
extremism and asked Palestnian children to write to him.
   In response, the newspaper received several letters from Arab
children and phone calls from interested Israelis, Hallak said.
   One Arab youth, 12-year-old Salam Ismail Obeidat from Jerusalem,
appealed for an end to violence by Israel's army. His letter is to
be published Friday.
   In his letter Wednesday, the first by an Israeli to be published
in An Nahar, Kay wrote:
   ``I like the Palestinian people, and I understand the reason of
your anger, which is your refusal of the occupation, and which is
your right to refuse live under it.
   ``Through your newspaper, I'm asking the representatives of the
Palestinian people and the Palestinian children to stop violence
and start negotiations.
   ``I want to point out that extremists among your people were a
reason for right-wing extremists among our people. Your rejection
of the occupation does not have to harm the Israeli children, and
pregnant women...
   ``You have the historical right and we also a historical
right...,'' Kay wrote.
   Responded Obeidat:
   ``I reject the occupation because it stole my land, my freedom
and my school.''
   ``I don't think when I ask for my freedom and my state that I am
commiting a violent act or being an extremist. If you, Lior, were a
Palestinian boy I think you probably would have fought the
occupation as the Palestinian kids are fighting.''
   ``We are not the reason for your suffering, Lior. This is not
our fault. But you are the reason of our suffering. This is your
fault.''
   Obeidat said Israelis who returned to their ancient homeland had
not been considerate of the Palestinians living on the same land.
   ``When you came back to live beside us what is the gift which
you brought for me, an airplane, a tank, a gun and tear gas bombs?
Is that a peaceful offering from a peaceful child, Lior?
   ``I am asking the Jews ... to quit using physical force, weapons
and tear gas which kills love and peace and innocents like me and
like you.''
   ``This is the only way to build the bridges for peace and love
between our nations and to build a peaceful state.''

   Vice President George Bush declined Thursday
to criticize Jesse Jackson, saying it would be ``a little
arrogant'' for him to assail a potential Democratic presidential
rival at this point in the campaign.
   Bush, apparently on his way to the Republican nomination, would
not bite at reporters' questions about whether he agreed with
President Reagan's assertion on Wednesday that some people are
reluctant to criticize Jackson because he is black.
   ``I haven't started punching any of the Democrats,'' Bush
replied when questioned during a picture-taking session with Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez at the White House.
   A day before, Reagan, who has remained officially neutral in the
Republican Party presidential race, took a swipe at Jackson, a
major contender for the Democratic nomination.
   Answering a question during his appearance before the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, Reagan said he hoped that ``race will
not be a part of this campaign in any way.''
   ``I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves
in great disagreement with the policies that he (Jackson) is
proposing, and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasn't
for concern that that be misinterpreted into some kind of racial
attack,'' the president said.
   Bush said that his preference was to ``wait until there is one
slow-moving target out there.''
   ``And I have decided that it would be a little arrogant,
somewhat presumptuous, to involve myself in the Democratic side of
this thing,'' the vice president said.
   ``They're working hard. I give them credit for that,'' Bush
said. ``I'm trying to do the same thing myself on our side, and we
would have been quite resentful if any one of them had started
singling out a Republican for criticism. That's what the general
election is about.''
   Bush said ``there will be plenty of time for that. So I've not
been involved in going after Jesse Jackson or Mike Dukakis or Al
Gore or the others.''
   ``You'll see a hard-hitting, tough in my view, close election in
the fall,'' Bush said. ``But the American people are going to have
a clear choice. The issues that they are running on or the
philosophy that they are running on are quite different than what
I'll be running on.''
   Later, Bush met with former former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont,
who dropped out of the presidential race in February. In response
to questions, Bush said he would make no decisions about a running

   With $234,000 already in hand, a ``flabbergasted''
radio station staff on Thursday continued counting loot that poured
in after a disc jockey asked listeners to send $20 checks without
saying what he would do with the money.
   ``We never promised anybody anything,'' said Ron Chapman, a
KVIL-FM disc jockey. ``That's the joy of this. We just said send
the money. We've got a back room full of people (counting money).
   ``We're absolutely stunned. We're flabbergasted.''
   Chapman said he asked his audience to send him money on March 31
as an experiment.
   After his first request, 4,000 checks for $20 each arrived in
the mail the next day. On the following Monday, an additional 5,000
checks arrived, a flood so heavy that Chapman went on the air to
say, ``OK, folks: that's it. Don't send any more checks after
today.''
   The station hasn't decided yet what to do. Chapman said it
initially planned to return the checks, possibly with $2 interest
and a T-shirt, but now is thinking about using it for a special
event.
   The station is keeping contributors' names in a computer file,
Chapman said.
   ``You've got to be careful. You've got to be real up front with
them, especially with their money,'' he said. ``People have been
angry that we won't let them send in more.''
   Ralph Blumberg, supervisor of investigations in the mass media
division of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington,
said there is nothing illegal about such a solicitation.
   ``As long as they don't make any promises or say they'll spend
the money one way and then spend it on something else, there
doesn't sound to be anything fraudulent about that,'' he said.
``There's nothing wrong with saying, `Send us your money.'''
   Some contributors confirmed Chapman's belief that listeners
trusted KVIL to handle their money.
   ``They seem to be legit,'' said Linda Steel, 40, of suburban
Burleson. ``I wouldn't do that for just anything. I don't have the
money.''
   Ms. Steel also said she was used to participating in contests
sponsored by the station with cash rewards. Last month, KVIL
broadcast serial numbers of dollar bills and awarded $10,000 to a
person holding a matching bill.
   Chapman, who has offered to return listeners' checks on demand,
said the station has received a steady stream of suggestions from
listeners about what to do with the money.
   Ms. Steel said she planned to request $80,000 to send her
daughter's high school drill team to Australia.
   Jon Mayer, 39, a contributor from Plano, had another suggestion:
``Multiply it times a million and send it back to me.''

<HEAD>State Wants to Block Book, Movie Profits for Gilbert's Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's attorney general asked a
court Thursday to bar a former lawyer for Roswell Gilbert,
convicted of murdering his ailing wife in a so-called mercy
killing, from spending book and movie profits that form part of his
legal fees.
   Attorney General Robert Butterworth cited Florida's so-called
``Son of Sam'' law in a petition to the Broward County Circuit
Court.
   Butterworth is seeking a lien against $45,000 allegedly received
by Joseph A. Varon for an NBC television movie, ``Mercy or
Murder?,'' about the killing, and any other profits from films or
books. Butterworth also wants an injunction barring expenditure of
such monies pending further investigation.
   ``The law says in the state of Florida that a convicted felon
cannot profit from his crime,'' Butterworth said. ``When someone
owes a debt to an attorney or signs over the book rights to their
crime in exchange for a legal fee that is a benefit going right to
the defendant who was convicted. Therefore, we are doing what we
can to get the money back.''
   Varon has been on an around-the-world cruise since January and
isn't due back until Monday, said the secretary in his Hollywood
law office.
   Gilbert, 78, a retired engineer, was convicted of first-degree
murder in 1985 and is serving a life prison term for shooting his
wife, Emily, in their condominium near Fort Lauderdale. He claimed
he killed her to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease and
osteoporosis, a bone degeneration.
   The Son of Sam law gets its title from the nickname of New York
serial murderer David Berkowitz, whose case inspired a similar law
in that state.
   ``The Legislature did not intend to block felons from profiting
... only to have defense lawyers pocket that money,'' Butterworth
said.
   The law calls for 25 percent of the proceeds from any such works
to go to dependents of the felon, if he has any, and 25 percent to
the victims of the crime or their dependents. The state can recover
prosecution, incarceration and other costs from the remaining 50
percent.
   State investigators have found Varon received $50,000 for the
NBC-TV film, which was broadcast last year starring Robert Young as
Gilbert, and that Varon now is attempting to sell a book,
Butterworth contends.
   He said the investigation showed Gilbert received only $5,000 of
that amount and donated it to a non-profit institution for
Alzheimer's research.

   An escaped murderer who vowed revenge on
those who had helped convict him was found hiding in a closet and
recaptured Thursday by police and federal agents.
   Bobby Dean Stacy, serving a life term in the West Virginia State
Penitentiary for the killing of a Huntington, W.Va., police
officer, offered no resistance, authorities said, when he was
arrested in the apartment of James Kennedy on the city's near west
side. Stacy was being held in the Franklin County Jail, pending his
return to West Virginia to face a charge of unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution.
   The manhunt continued for the two other inmates who, along with
Stacy, used stolen bolt cutters to escape April 3 from the
Mounsdville, W.Va., prison. Tommie Mollohan, 45, and David
Williams, 28, remained at large, although the hunt for Mollohan
narrowed after a sheriff's deputy reported spotting him in Marshall
County, W.Va.
   The FBI said Stacy's friendship with Kennedy led agents and
police officers to the West Rich Street apartment where Kennedy
lived with his wife.
   ``We basically knocked on the door and asked if we could search
it,'' said FBI agent Douglass C. Ogden. ``They let us in.''
   A few moments later, authorities found Stacy hiding in a closet.
He was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but was not armed.
   Kennedy was taken into custody for questioning and could face
charges related to the escape, Ogden said. Kennedy's wife was not
arrested.
   Stacy, 36, had been convicted of killing a Huntington, W.Va.,
police officer and accused of shooting a Huber Heights, Ohio,
officer and had vowed revenge on those who had put him behind bars,
officials said.

   Republican Senate candidate George V.
Voinovich, who has criticized the extent of Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum's out-of-state fundraising, is planning his own series
of events outside Ohio to raise money, a campaign spokesman said
Thursday.
   Metzenbaum is seeking re-election to a third full term in
November. He is expected to easily win the Democratic primary
against a little-known opponent, but face a stiff challenge from
Voinovich, the mayor of Cleveland.
   ``The mayor is going to make a prudent number of trips outside
the state for fundraising, but in no way will he be able to match
the pace of Sen. Metzenbaum,'' said Joe Wagner, Voinovich campaign
spokesman.
   ``We never once said we would reserve ourselves to in-state
fundraising,'' Wagner added. ``So I don't see any major change in
strategy. We have made it plain and clear it will take about $7
million for us to run a strong campaign against Sen. Metzenbaum.''
   In a March 31 letter mailed nationally to contributors to The
Republican Senatorial Trust, a GOP campaign fundraising
organization, Voinovich wrote that he will not let Metzenbaum
``dominate'' him in out-of-Ohio fundraising.
   Voinovich events were set for Thursday night in Pittsburgh and
Friday in St. Louis and Houston. Other cities where Voinovich
events are planned or being planned include Atlanta, Baltimore, New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle, Wagner
confirmed.
   In a campaign stop Wednesday in Cincinnati, Voinovich said he
will come ``nowhere near'' matching Metzenbaum in percentage of
funds from outside Ohio.
   ``If he criticizes me for raising money outside Ohio, it will be
a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black,'' Voinovich
said.
   Voinovich had previously asked Metzenbaum to agree to a campaign
spending cap of $5 million each.
   ``They didn't do it,'' Voinovich said.
   Metzenbaum is expected to raise at least $10 million for his
re-election campaign.
   ``We have called upon the mayor repeatedly to support the
campaign finance reform act presently in the Senate and he has
refused to do so,'' said Dale Butland, Metzenbaum's campaign press
secretary. ``That bill would also control spending by outside
groups on behalf of candidates, and I don't expect the mayor would
like that.''
   According to Federal Election Commission reports filed earlier
this year, about 70 percent of Metzenbaum's campaign funds had come
from outside Ohio.
   Butland said that when the next round of FEC reports are filed,
the percentage of Metzenbaum funds coming from out-of-state will
have ``reduced substantially.'' Over 10,000 individual Ohioans have
contributed to the Metzenbaum campaign so far, Butland said.

   Former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro says Jesse Jackson won't be the party's
presidential nominee and wouldn't be in the race if he were white.
   Speaking Wednesday at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, Ferraro credited Jackson for ``grabbing the imagination of
the public'' and said he is ``telling people the things we want to
hear, but he won't be able to deliver what he is promising.''
   A Jackson supporter attending the speech took quick exception to
Ferraro's remarks.
   ``I think your comments here today are extremely, extremely
dangerous and I abhor you for saying something like that,'' said
Samuel Herbert, a former candidate for Erie County Executive.
   ``I will not let you get away with that,'' Ferraro responded.
``You may abhor what I've said, but I have spoken the truth. ...
looking at the numbers, he will not have enough delegates. He will
not even have a majority of delegates that are chosen.''
   Ferraro, now a resident fellow at Harvard University, lauded the
Jackson campaign as ``worthwhile for this nation.'' But, she said,
if the civil rights leader ``were not black, he wouldn't be in the
race.''

   Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of
state who has been persona non grata in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee since it was revealed he lied about secret U.S.
efforts to resupply Nicaragua's Contra rebels, has made peace with
the panel's chairman.
   In a letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Abrams apologized
for ``misleading'' testimony he gave the committee on Oct. 10, 1986.
   Abrams noted in a March 31 letter to Pell that he previously had
apologized to the House Intelligence Committee for similar
inaccurate responses to questions about U.S. involvement in a
private Contra aid network and about enlisting foreign governments
to aid the rebels.
   Recalling the Foreign Relations hearing, Abrams said, ``My
testimony that day covered much of this same territory, and
accordingly, I want to offer you and through you the members of the
committee the same apology.''
   On Wednesday, Pell sent a two-sentence letter to Abrams saying,
``Your apology is accepted'' and concluding: ``I look forward to
your working again with the committee on important Latin American
issues.''
   During last year's Iran-Contra hearings, it was disclosed that
Abrams' testimony had been wrong. At one point, Abrams told
investigators he didn't level with Congress because he was not
authorized to tell the truth.
   From then on, Abrams _ the administration's chief spokesman on
Western Hemisphere matters as assistant secretary for
inter-American affairs _ ran into credibility problems on Capitol
Hill. Some committees forced him to take an oath of truthfulness
before permitting him to testify, and the Foreign Relations panel
placed a flat ban on any appearances.
   Members of Congress complained bitterly that Abrams' performance
illustrated an aid-at-any-price attitude on the part of the
administration and said they no longer could trust the
administration on anything having to do with Nicaragua policy.
   In an incident March 17, Abrams sought to attend an
administration briefing for senators on a Nicaraguan-Honduran
border incident and was turned away at the door of the Capitol
meeting room by Senate aides.

<HEAD>Arizona Democrats To Pick Candidates In Saturday Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona political news has been dominated
recently by the ouster of Republican Gov. Evan Mecham, but
Democrats will reclaim the spotlight, at least temporarily, with
presidential caucuses on Saturday.
   The outcome is viewed as a tossup between Michael Dukakis, who
has lined up endorsements from key Democrats, and Jesse Jackson,
whose firmly committed supporters may be more likely to turn out at
the caucuses.
   ``I think we can win Arizona,'' Jackson coordinator John Norris
said Thursday, ``because people committed to Jesse Jackson tend to
be more apt to go out and vote.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, has been gaining endorsements from the likes
of Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, Tucson Mayor Tom Volgy, and a
number of state lawmakers and local government officials.
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Jose Villarreal said the endorsements
were significant ``because these are all very well-known and
respected individuals.''
   Arizona's caucuses begin the process of alloting 36 national
convention delegates _ a mere blip compared to the 255 at stake in
New York's primary on Tuesday. The caucuses resemble a primary in
that voters merely cast their ballots and leave. But there are only
99 polling places statewide _ far fewer than the 1,932 regular
voting precincts _ which means Democrats must find out where to
vote and travel farther. Voters will make two choices: a
presidential preference and a delegate ballot.
   ``Jackson is at a distinct advantage under this kind of a
system,'' Villarreal said, adding that Jackson won in Michigan,
which has a similar voting process.
   The only objective indicator of support is a survey several
weeks old that showed Dukakis as the choice of 36 percent, compared
to 17 percent for Jackson and 4 percent for Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. But the poll had a small sample and did not screen for
likely voters.
   ``I think it's anybody's race at this point,'' said one Dukakis
supporter, state Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens. ``I think
Arizonans are just now focusing on this primary. They've been
consumed with the Mecham trial.''
   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office on April 4 by the
Senate impeachment court.
   Jackson supporter Sen. Carolyn Walker predicted her candidate
will win, adding, ``I think the die-hard Jackson supporters are
going to find their way out (to the polls). I kind of feel a little
bit in that Dukakis takes Arizona for granted.''
   The new governor, Rose Mofford, is a Democrat, but has not
endorsed any of the candidates. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who
dropped out of the 1988 race in February, appeared with Jackson at
a rally last week but did not endorse him.
   Jackson's campaign has done no advertising, while Villarreal
said Dukakis has spent only about $1,500 on radio ads statewide.
   Blacks make up less than 10 percent of Arizona's population. The
state keeps no statistics on what percentage of Arizona's 1.58
million registered voters are minorities.
   State party executive director Glenn Davis said he expected only
25,000 to 30,000 of the state's registered 683,000 Democrats to
vote Saturday.
   ``That's why I think Jackson can win here because he's well
organized and his people will go vote,'' Davis said.
   Only registered Democrats can vote but the party says it will
have registrars on hand to register new voters.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen holding a hijacked Kuwaiti
jetliner at Algiers airport released one of their hostages today as
negotiations to end the 10-day-old crisis appeared to intensify.
   A man dressed in a white robe came down the stairs of the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747 at 9:45 p.m. (4:45 p.m. EDT), got into a car and
was driven rapidly across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at Houari
Boumedienne Airport.
   The freed hostage, who was not immediately identified, was
greeted by Kuwaiti officials and hustled inside the building.
   Earlier in the day, a passenger aboard the plane pleaded with
his government to meet the gunmen's demands, saying if it didn't,
all aboard the plane would be killed.
   Algerian mediators and the Shiite Moslem hijackers resumed their
talks for the release of the remaining passengers and crew aboard
the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 after a suspension earlier in the day.
   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
extremists convicted of terrorism. Kuwait has rejected the demand.
   The plane was commandeered April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight
with 112 people aboard. It was first diverted to Mashhad, Iran,
where 57 people were freed. It went on to Cyprus, where two
hostages were killed and 13 released, and flew to Algiers on
Tuesday.
   The hijackers, thought to number five to eight, are armed with
grenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane and kill
their hostages.
   A passenger told the control tower today by radio, ``My name is
Ahmed Zayed.'' His words were monitored by reporters. ``Hello.
Hello to my family. I am in good health. I ask the government to
release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us
all.''
   The talks had reached an impasse on Wednesday. A ranking
Algerian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday that Kuwait's ``intransigence'' had created the
standstill.
   A Cypriot official said the jet was refueled and allowed to
leave Cyprus only after Algeria gave assurances that the remaining
passengers would be freed on arrival there.
   ``Our objective all along was the safe release of the hostages.
We believed we had succeeded in this when the hijackers released
... hostages here, with the rest to be freed in Algiers, according
to the Algerian assurance,'' government spokesman Akis Fantis said.
   There are believed to be about 32 Arab passengers and four crew
members aboard the plane. Three passengers are members of Kuwait's
large royal family.
   Two U.S. congressmen Wednesday asked Secretary of George Shultz
to intervene with the negotiators because one of the hijackers may
also have kidnapped Americans being held hostage in Beirut.
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., cited a
report in the independent Kuwaiti newspaper al-Qabas that said one
of the Kuwaiti jet hijackers may be Imad Mughniyeh.
   They said Mughniyeh may have been the chief kidnapper of
American hostage Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press.
   Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut on May 16, 1985, and is the
longest held of 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon. His abductors also
have demanded that Kuwait release the 17 pro-Iranian extremists.
   Al-Qabas quoted unidentified sources as saying Mughniyeh was
believed to have boarded the plane when it stopped in Iran.
   This morning, the blue-and-white plane was moved to the end of a
runway at Houari Boumedienne airport to permit the safe landing of
a plane carrying Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, who arrived on a
state visit.
   Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, before greeting Kaunda, met
briefly with Mohammed Al-Osaimi, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait.
   The president was given a message from Kuwaiti Emir Shiek Jabar
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, according to Algiers radio, monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London. No details were provided.
   A newspaper in Abu Dhabi said today that an agreement had been
reached for the release of the Kuwaiti hostages.
   Al-Ittihad, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources in Larnaca,
said ``an agreement was signed by hijackers, Kuwaiti, Palestinian
and Algerian officials, for releasing passengers and hijackers in
Algerias in exchanging for reducing sentences against the 17
persons in Kuwait jails.''
   The 17 jailed in Kuwait were convicted for the Dec. 1983
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there. Kuwait's defense
minister, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed Al Sabah, on Wednesday affirmed his
country's ``unwavering and principled stance of rejecting
blackmail,'' Kuwait's news agency reported.
   Food and water were taken Wednesday afternoon to the jet, which
the hijackers call the ``plane of martyrdom.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Urges Multinational Effort Against Noriega</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee said Thursday the Reagan administration is running out of
plans for ousting Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
is doing little to enlist neighboring countries to turn up the
pressure.
   ``Some of us on the committee feel strongly that we must get
more support from other Latin American countries so it does not
seem as if it's a direct confrontation between Noriega and the
United States,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the committee
chairman.
   Pell and others attended a briefing by Pentagon and State
Department officials on the situation in Panama during which
possible further economic sanctions against the country were
outlined, as well as several top-secret, non-economic options.
   ``Mr. Noriega is getting stronger every day that we do
nothing,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking GOP
member of the committee.
   ``He's getting more arms from Cuba, while we're sitting here
talking about what we've done for the banks,'' Helms said in
reference to economic sanctions already in place.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said there was a consensus among
those at the briefing that ``it is terribly important, although
difficult, to get our Latin American allies to step forward and
play a role. ... As much as they don't want Noriega in power, it's
difficult for them to stand up and be counted in a visible way.''
   Kassebaum said that as the weeks wear on and Noriega remains in
place, the more the United States risks a backlash from the
economic sanctions because of the suffering the sanctions cause for
Panamanian citizens.
   ``It will begin to turn on us and we'll be blamed,'' she said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the Reagan administration ``has
been sending divided signals'' that prolong Noriega's tenure.
   ``There is no evidence of a major diplomatic effort'' reaching
out to other Central American leaders or to the internal opposition
inside Panama, Kerry said. ``The way to avoid the use of troops is
to pursue these other measures.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sent a letter to
President Reagan asking that U.S. policy give greater emphasis to
the common hemispheric interest in combatting drugs. Noriega has
been indicted in the United States on drug charges, and has been
accused of turning his country into a haven for drug traffickers.
   ``I believe it is time for the United States to stop going it
alone and to place this serious problem of General Noriega and drug
dealing before the Organization of American States,'' Byrd told
Reagan.
   That theme was taken up by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
during an appearance Thursday before the American Society of
Newspaper Editors.
   ``If you act unilaterally in Panama, you'll be isolated,'' Arias
said of U.S. policy.
   ``You need to get support from the rest of Central America,'' he
said, adding, ``If you want to punish Noriega, economic sanctions
is not the best answer. You are then punishing the Panamanian
people but not General Noriega.''
   He said the conflict in Panama can only be resolved through
negotiations.

   A mail-order minister who claimed his
religious position made his stop-smoking clinics exempt from
licensing requirements has been arrested and accused of fabricating
a plot against city officials, police said.
   Joel Witmer, 45, of Clearwater was charged Wednesday with
threatening a public official, a felony. Bond was set at $50,000
and Witmer remained in the Pinellas County Jail on Thursday.
   He had told police that members of his ``religious cult''
planned to kill three city officials because of his dispute over
the license.
   Police, who put the three officials in protective custody,
eventually concluded there was no such cult and no such plot, said
Capt. Barry Glover.
   According to investigators, Witmer claimed that he unwittingly
released $6,000 to his followers with which they planned to buy
weapons.
   In reality, police said, Witmer hatched the plot and the phone
call ``tip-off'' to police in order to frighten licensing officials
who refused to honor his bid for religious exemption.
   Witmer told police he has a doctorate degree from the Universal
Life Church of Modesto, Calif., a mail-order outfit that once
ordained a dog, investigators said in a statement.
   Several years ago, Witmer was convicted of extortion and
sentenced to two years in prison after another dispute involving
the smoking clinics, but that conviction was reversed on appeal.
   ``I just hope this (arrest) will put a stop to Mr. Witmer's
method of attempting to intimidate people and use threats to get
his own way,'' Glover said Wednesday. ``We are going to ask for
restitution. At one point or another everybody in this division has
worked on this case this past week.''
   Witmer has been at odds with Clearwater officials since 1985,
when an occupational license for his UFS Stop-Smoking Clinic first
became an issue, according to a police affidavit. He conducts the
clinics at various hotels.
   Witmer obtained the license in previous years. But he refused to
renew it this year, claiming he was exempt because of his religious
status. The city would not recognize a religious exemption.
   On April 4, Witmer called police and said three members of what
he described as his own ``religious cult'' planned to kill or
seriously injure city officials because they believed that the city
was harassing Witmer. He said he unwittingly helped the plot by
releasing $6,000 to the conspirators. Witmer promised to try to
stop his followers from harming city officials, but he refused to
identify them until he was held in contempt of court April 6.
   On the way to jail, Witmer named the ``conspirators.'' But the
names he gave were of two Florida State University police officers
who had contact with Witmer during one of his prior arrests.
   In 1976, he told the editors of a Florida State University
campus newspaper that he would ``check into hiring a professional
to rearrange your faces'' because he thought the newspaper libeled
him, according to an arrest warrant.
   The warrant also said during 1976 he threatened the wife of a
professor who told him the university would not renew his
stop-smoking clinic contract. In 1979, his bid to conduct similar
clinics at FSU was again turned down.
   He threatened to kill everyone involved with the rejection and
was convicted of extortion. Witmer was sentenced to two years in
prison, but an appeal court threw out the case, ruling that
authorities erred in their investigation.

   Soldiers shot two Arabs dead Thursday and
wounded four, including a child who lost an eye, and a 12-year-old
Palestinian wrote an open letter to a Jewish boy saying the
violence kills ``innocents like me and you.''
   A strike called by the PLO to protest mass arrests of Arabs
virtually shut down the the occupied lands and east Jerusalem, but
some Palestinians have begun complaining about the economic pinch
caused by repeated strikes.
   At least 146 Palestinians have been killed since riots began
Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N.
figures, and hundreds have been wounded. An Israeli soldier and a
15-year-old Jewish settler also have been slain.
   U.N. officials in Vienna accused Israeli soldiers of using tear
gas improperly, sometimes causing deadly effects by throwing
canisters into small, enclosed areas, and also indicated Israel
might be using another form of toxic gas. The army denied the
allegations.
   Hospital officials said a 70-year-old Arab woman suffocated on
Wednesday after soldiers threw a tear gas canister into her home.
The army said she died of natural causes.
   Salem Ismail Obediat, who is 12 and lives in an Arab
neighborhood of Jerusalem, wrote to the Arabic-language daily An
Nahar in response to a note it published Wednesday from Lior Kay of
Tel Aviv. The 13-year-old Jewish boy had said he wanted to start a
dialogue with Arab children.
   ``You are the reason for our suffering, Lior,'' Salem's letter
said.
   ``When you came back to live beside me, what is the gift you
brought for me? An airplane, a tank, a gun and tear gas bombs. Is
that a peaceful offering for a peaceful child?''
   ``Quit ... using force which kills love, peace and innocents
like me and you,'' Salem wrote.
   Israeli officials claimed Thursday that the number and size of
Arab protests was declining.
   ``It is clear the level of violence is less but this doesn't
mean the uprising is over,'' said Avi Pazner, an aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of staff, said protests now
involve only Palestinian activists, ``so when soldiers are forced
to fire, they usually hit the inciters themselves.''
   Israeli military commanders in the West Bank held riot-control
maneuvers in a deserted neighborhood of Nablus and demonstrated a
helicopter that dumps rocks onto Arab protesters. Palestinians say
it has been used for at least two weeks.
   The most serious clash Thursday occurred in the narrow streets
of the Nablus central market, whose shops were closed because of
the strike order.
   Army spokesmen said young Arabs on roofs threw stones and cinder
blocks at soldiers, who opened fire and killed a 24-year-old
Palestinian.
   An official at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus identified the
victim as Wael Hassan Asmar and said two other Arabs were wounded.
   Arab reporters said soldiers killed another Palestinian, Nassar
Fahmi al Lidawi, at the Nablus market. The army confirmed the death
and said it was investigating the circumstances.
   In nearby Tulkarm, Mohammed Fuad Taha, 12, lost his right eye
after being hit with a rubber bullet, said an official at Rafidiyeh
Hospital in Nablus. He said a 17-year-old was in critical condition
with a stomach wound.
   At Tekoa near Bethlehem, protesters burned tires and threw
stones at passing vehicles, slightly injuring two Jewish children
in a bus, army radio reported.
   Palestinians padlocked their stores, halted buses and stayed
home from jobs in Israel in response to Leaflet No. 13 issued by
the underground Palestine Liberation Organization leadership.
``Ramallah is a dead city,'' an Arab there said.
   The strike was called ``to protest the collective arrests of our
people,'' the leaflet said. According to Israeli officials, nearly
5,000 Arabs have been rounded up since violence began in the
territories Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Farah al-Araj, mayor of Beit Jallah, said his city observed the
strike but some Palestinians were ``feeling the seriousness of the
economic strike.''
   ``If no help is given to the people from outside, I think within
one or two months they will get fed up,'' he told Israel radio.
   New questions were raised about the death of Tirza Porat, the
15-year-old daughter of Jewish settlers who was killed April 6 in a
clash with Arabs in Beita, a West Bank town.
   The army said she was hit by a bullet from an M-16 rifle carried
by one of two Israeli guards accompanying Miss Porat and 15 other
teen-agers on a hiking trip. Army investigators said they did not
know who pulled the trigger.
   On Thursday, Israel television cited a police report as saying
it was not known what gun fired the shot because the bullet was not
recovered.
   Some of the other hikers have said they saw a Palestinian point
a Kalashnikov rifle at the girl.

   An underwater explosion tore open the hull of
an American guided-missile frigate in the central Persian Gulf and
injured 10 crewmen Thursday. Pentagon sources said it appeared the
warship hit a mine.
   The injured sailors _ six with slight burns, one with
second-degree burns, one with a hernia and two with back injuries _
were evacuated from the USS Samuel B. Roberts, the Defense
Department said.
   The Roberts then began steaming slowly under its own power
toward port in Bahrain.
   The sailor with the second-degree burns was flown to Bahrain,
the Pentagon said late Thursday. The other nine were transferred to
the USS San Jose, a combat stores ship operating in the central
gulf.
   Defense sources said the crew of the Roberts had spotted ``some
mine-like objects'' in the water immediately before the 10:10 a.m.
EDT explosion. The Pentagon declined official comment on the report.
   The sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the frigate was
``making only about two knots'' on its own power Thursday afternoon
and would probably be taken under tow by the cruiser Wainwright.
   The Roberts and Wainwright are two of 14 Navy ships assigned to
the Persian Gulf force to provide protection to commercial ships
flying the American flag. The San Jose was in the area only because
it was on a resupply mission.
   The Reagan administration increased the U.S. force in the region
last summer in response to a request from Kuwait, whose oil tankers
come under attack in the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
Roberts had been in no danger of sinking and that the crew had
managed to staunch flooding in the engine compartments on its own.
   Howard refused to attribute the explosion to a mine, saying it
was premature to form a judgment. ``Underwater explosion is the way
to describe it. We don't know what caused the explosion,'' he told
reporters.
   However, other Pentagon officials were less reticent. ``The
assumption is definitely that it was a mine,'' said one source.
   According to Howard, the Roberts was steaming southbound on a
routine patrol Thursday morning after completing a convoy operation
the night before. The frigate, which had escorted the Kuwaiti
tanker Gas King northward to Kuwait without incident, was almost
dead center in the Persian Gulf when it was suffered the explosion
_ about 70 miles to the east of a navigational bell located off the
coast of Bahrain.
   The explosion ``caused flooding in the engine room and some hull
damage,'' Howard said. ``The flooding is under control, and the
ship is in the process of pumping out the water. It's operating
under auxiliary power.''
   The Roberts, whose home port is Newport, R.I., had left for
Persian Gulf duty on Jan. 11 and was scheduled to leave the gulf
for home around June 4, the Pentagon said.
   According to Howard, the explosion occurred well to the south of
the spot near the Iranian-controlled Farsi Island where a reflagged
Kuwaiti tanker, the Bridgeton, hit a mine during the first of the
Navy's convoy operation last July.
   Howard said there had been no recent reports by mine sweepers in
the area that mines had been sighted.
   The last mine to be discovered in the gulf's waters was located
on April 9 near Farsi, the Pentagon said. To date, 44 underwater
mines have been destroyed by U.S. forces in the gulf.
   The Roberts is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the
USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air
attack. Thirty-seven crewmen died in that attack.
   Ships of that class normally carry a crew of about 13 officers
and 190 enlisted men. The Pentagon said the Roberts was carrying
about 225 men, however, because it had a helicopter detachment
aboard from Mayport, Fla..
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan had been told of the incident, which he said ``only
emphasizes our concern for stopping the Iran-Iraq war.''
   Fitzwater said the administration intended to step up pressure
in the U.N. Security Council for a resolution that would not only
put an end to the war but put the group on record in favor of
sanctions against belligerents in the war.

   Here, at a glance, are economic developments Thursday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The monthly U.S. trade deficit expanded by $1.4 billion, more
than 11 percent, in February to $13.8 billion, its second straight
rise.
   Imports increased $2.6 billion to $37.4 billion, led by imports
of electrical equipment and auto and truck parts. Exports also rose
$1.2 billion to $23.6 billion.
   For 1988, the deficit's annual rate is $157.6 billion, below the
record $171.2 billion for 1987 but still worse than the 1986
imbalance of $156.2 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The news of the increase in the trade deficit sent the stock
market reeling. The Dow Jones average fell 101.46 to 2,005.63., its
worst decline since it plunged 140.58 points on Jan. 8.
   Analysts noted the Dow climbed nearly 130 points from April
5-12, anticipating favorable trade news. The report, they said,
wiped out the basis for that rally.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plummeted against most major currencies within
minutes of the trade announcement, a tailspin only partially
stemmed by coordinated central bank intervention.
   In London, it cost $1.8755 to buy one pound, up from Wednesday's
rate of $1.8445.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 123.60 yen.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Growth of business inventories slowed in February, increasing by
only $825 million, or 0.1 percent. The small gain followed a string
of steep increases after the stock market crash.
   The February inventory increase occurred while business sales
climbed 0.6 percent, reversing a 0.5 percent drop in January.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in March, the government reported
Wednesday, increasing by a seasonally adjusted $1.1 billion to
$130.7 billion.
   It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest
since December, when sales shot up 1.1 percent.
   The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to
1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust
inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not
considered abnormally high.

   There's McMuffins, McNuggets and McDLTs, but
the news these days from McDonalds in the Elmira area is an Mc of a
different taste _ McBone.
   The king of fast foods is serving up free doggie biscuits to
burger-buying customers who bring their pooch to the drive-thru
window.
   So far, the response has been great.
   ``The customers really appreciate it,'' says Michael Huffcut,
supervisor of the Ithaca-Elmira McDonald's restaurants. ``They're
shocked at first, then I think they're impressed.''
   The new service is being offered only at seven McDonald's in the
area.
   ``We felt if a customer loves their pet enough to bring them, we
ought to try to make it a fun experience for the pet, too,.''
Huffcut said.
   The crew at the window say they get the bones ready to hand out
even before the burgers and fries.
   ``We can hear the dog barking, so we're ready usually when the
car gets to the window,'' says Kimberly Gallaher, 25, who works at
the Horseheads McDonald's.

   Arranging his wife's 50th birthday
celebration was no piece of cake for Thomas Collins.
   To begin with, the birthday bash for Jane Collins on Tuesday
night was held in the Metrodome sports arena, a gift Cadillac was
parked on the pitcher's mound, lifelong friends from around the
world attended, along with the Apple Valley High School marching
band, Golden Strings ensemble, a sit-down dinner for more than 50
and fireworks.
   And more.
   One hundred huge pictures depicting the former professional
skater and beauty queen from 3 months old until the present stood
on easels placed around the bases.
   It was a flashback of my life,'' Mrs. Collins said Wednesday.
   ``I think my husband is one of the most fantastic people on
earth and I don't believe he did all of this,'' she added.
   For weeks, her husband had been returning at night to his office
at Collins Enterprises in Bloomington to organize a professional
skating tour _ or so she thought.
   In reality, the Edina businessman, who also handles promotional
merchandise for several pop music stars, was planning the party.

<HEAD>Medical Ethicists Call for Caution in Using Doomed Infants as
Organ Donors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infants born with only a fraction of a normal
brain should not be immediately used as a source of donor organs
even though they are doomed, say two medical ethicists who argue
that doctors must wait for true ``brain death'' to occur.
   Such infants, called anencephalics, have a brain stem, which
enables them to breathe. But they have no cerebral cortex, the part
of the brain that allows thought and voluntary movement.
   Most die within 24 hours and all within weeks of birth, and they
are increasingly viewed by some within the medical community as a
potential pool of donor organs for children needing transplants.
   At issue is both the appropriateness of using anencephalics as
donors _ and how soon.
   ``Organ donation is very laudable and people say these kids will
inevitably die,'' said Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, co-author with John
Arras of a commentary in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   ``But then what makes that different from a number of newborns
with congential fatal diseases? Or other kids and adults in
vegetative states?'' Shinnar said.
   ``And what if there are not enough anencephalics and the
transplant needs are greater two years from now? Who do we look at
next?
   ``These are steps we can take only after very, very careful
review,'' said Shinnar, a pediatric neurologist at Montefiore
Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in a telephone
interview from New York City.
   There are between 2,000 and 3,000 anencephalic infants among the
3 million children born in the United States each year, the federal
Centers for Disease Control estimates.
   The problem can be detected before birth with ultrasound and
abortion is considered appropriate by some doctors as late as the
final three months of pregnancy, the commentary said.
   ``Should we be encouraging pregnant women, in essence, to carry
these children to term to provide spare parts?'' Shinnar said.
   Questions about their use as organ donors were raised after
newspaper reports last October that organs had been taken from
anencephalic infants and transplanted into other children in West
Germany and California.
   ``In the West German case, they took a baby from delivery, put a
tube (of oxygen) in its mouth, took it to the operating room,
harvested the organs and buried it,'' said Shinnar.
   ``And in the United States, although it did not pass, there was
a bill in the legislature in California to have these children
declared `brain-dead' at birth,'' he added.
   Shinnar said legal definitions of brain death used in making
medical determinations require an end of all brain functions,
including those of the brain stem.
   The debate took a new turn in December, when the Loma Linda
(Calif.) University Medical Center developed guidelines under which
anencephalic babies are to be sustained on respirators and used for
transplants only if brain death occurs within a week. Otherwise,
they are removed from the respirators and allowed to die naturally.
   Six anencephalic infants have been kept alive by respirator for
a week under those guidelines, though none ultimately became an
organ donor, said Loma Linda spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   ``We wrote our article before the protocol (guideline) was
developed,'' said Shinnar, ``and this certainly lessens the
magnitude of the ethical debate.
   ``We are no longer talking about actively taking a life, though
this protocol is not without its problems as well. What about
extending the tragedy for the parents of an anencephalic child?''
he said.
   ``The issue is not that the practice is common, because it's
not,'' he said. ``But the argument over whether this is a good,
sound idea or something that should be opposed _ as we feel _ has
to take place before it becomes so.''

   The head of the West German central bank said
Thursday that his country has done all it can to stimulate its own
economy as part of the effort to lower the U.S. trade deficit.
   ``We have the lowest interest rates in the world ... and it
would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary
policies,'' Karl Otto Poehl told a National Press Club luncheon.
   His remarks came amid turmoil on world financial markets. The
dollar fell and stocks tumbled in reaction to news that the U.S.
trade deficit for February widened by more than 11 percent to $13.8
billion.
   A heated dispute over interest rates last year between Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and the West Germans has been cited as
one of the contributing factors to Oct. 19 stock market plunge.
   Since that time, world financial leaders have gone out of their
way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts.
   With Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan looking on, Poehl
sidestepped questions at the luncheon about whether the Fed should
tighten the U.S. money supply, which would drive up interest rates
and make the dollar more attractive.
   However, he said West Germany, by keeping its interest rates
low, ``couldn't have done more.''
   Poehl said the Bundesbank's dollar reserves have increased by
$15 billion in the past year to $50 billion and indicated it was
among the central banks intervening Thursday to buy dollars on
world exchange markets.
   ``Today was a day where, I think, we have demonstrated to the
markets our readiness, and our willingness ... in the future,'' he
said.
   Poehl cautioned against overreacting to Thursday's trade deficit
figures.
   ``One should not be confused by a monthly trade figure. That's a
very temporary statistic. The true conditions for more stable
exchange rates are much better than some years ago,'' he said.
   He also said the United States should not expect to be in
equilibrium with every trading partner all the time. He said West
Germany, as an aging nation with a stable population, needs to be a
net exporter.
   Germany's trade surplus with the United States, which was $2.2
billion in the first two months of this year, is far smaller than
Japan's, at $8.5 billion, and less than Taiwan's, at $2.7 billion,
he said.

<TEXT>
   Farmland prices are up for the first time in
six years but still are far from returning to the peak levels of
1982, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   As of Feb. 1, the average value of U.S. farmland, including
buildings, was $564 per acre, up 3 percent from a 19-year low of
$548 per acre recorded last year, the department said in its annual
report.
   But the Feb. 1 reading was still down 32 percent from the record
high of $823 per acre in 1982.
   In real terms, allowing for an inflation of nearly 4 percent
last year, farmland nationally dropped again to an average of $288
per acre, down 1 percent from $290 a year earlier. That would be
the lowest since the early 1960s.
   Farmland values vary greatly across the country, and not all
regions or states share in the increase. More than a dozen states
showed a further decline or no gain from a year ago.
   Roger Hexem, a farmland analyst in the department's Economic
Research Service, said there are too many variables _ interest
rates and farm income estimates, for example _ to make a prediction
of a future trend.
   ``It don't think it necessarily follows that they're going to be
higher next year,'' Hexem said in an interview. ``I think there are
just too many uncertainties.''
   Hexem added: ``We just can't put ourselves into the minds of
those who are looking at the markets. One's expectation of what's
going to happen in terms of returns to the land are kind of
peculiar to that individual. And if that individual is more
optimistic than others, then he or she is probably more inclined to
get into the market and bid prices up.''
   The report, which Hexem supervised, noted that U.S. farm income
was a record high in 1987, but ``was enhanced by government
payments equivalent to nearly 30 percent of net cash income.''
   Higher farm income and lower debt improved the equity position
of farmers in 1987, and interest rates averaged lower than in 1986.
However, those rates edged up slightly late last year, the report
said.
   Regionally, the Northeast showed a 9 percent increase in
farmland prices as of Feb. 1, continuing an upward trend that began
in the mid-1940s, the report said. The Corn Belt also rose 9
percent, and the Northern Plains averaged 7 percent higher, the
first advances since the early 1980s.
   ``In both regions, values rose in all states, particularly Iowa
(up 19 percent),'' the report said. ``Minnesota's 14 percent gain
led the Lake States' 7 percent growth, while values were up 6
percent in the Southeast and 2 percent in Appalachia.''
   A 4 percent drop in Louisiana farmland values was offset by
higher prices in other states, which left the Delta states
essentially unchanged for the year.
   ``The upturns in farmland values did not extend to the Western
regions, where most state values continued downward into 1988,''
the report said. ``Regional values were down 3 percent in the
Southern Plains, 2 percent in the Mountain states and 2 percent in
the Pacific region. But the rates of decline were lower than in the
past two years.''

   An car-bomb explosion ripped through a club
for U.S. servicemen in Naples today, killing five people, Italian
authorities said. A U.S. sailor was among the dead, according to
the Pentagon.
   A U.S. Consulate spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he had been told five people were killed. Italian media quoted
officials as saying five people died in the blast.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said a U.S. sailor was killed
and four sailors were wounded. Lt. Col. Jim Jannette said the
explosion was the ``result of an apparent car bomb'' near the USO
club.
   An Associated Press photo stringer said he saw two bodies
covered with a blanket at the entrance to the club.
   Consulate spokesman Tim Randall said an investigation is
continuing but that Italian authorities believe the 8 p.m. (2 p.m.
EDT) blast was caused by a car bomb.
   The consulate did not yet know the identities of the dead and
injured and did not know how many were U.S. servicemen, Randall
said.
   The explosion destroyed the inside of the club, ANSA said.
   A police spokesman in Naples said earlier that there were some
dead and between 10 and 15 injured at the United Service
Organizations club.
   Fire officials said the explosion ignited a fire that sent a
dense black cloud of smoke into the sky and caused panic in the
streets nearby.
   The U.S. 6th Fleet is based in Naples.

<HEAD>DEA Agents Will Carry More Firepower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug agents, starting in Florida, are
getting a big boost in firepower with the issue of semi-automatic
guns to even the odds against drug dealers often armed with Uzis
and Mac-10 machine guns.
   Each of South Florida's 341 DEA agents is being issued a 9mm
Colt submachine gun as well as a 15-shot 9mm sidearm as their
primary, personal weapons, said Jack Hook, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration's Miami office.
   Until now, DEA agents have gone into battle carrying six-shot,
.38-caliber handguns and shotguns.
   All 3,000 DEA agents nationwide will get the increased firepower
as soon as possible, Hook said.
   ``The managers of DEA are sick and tired of burying dead DEA
agents who have been killed in gunfights by traffickers who have
outgunned those agents,'' Hook said, noting that five agents have
been killed nationally in the last 14 months.
   The DEA is the first federal agency to issue submachine guns
routinely. Customs and FBI agents still carry .38- and .357-caliber
weapons, Hook said.
   He said agents in cities such as Miami, Los Angeles and New York
with big drug problems are slated to get the guns first.
   He said the Miami division is the first to receive the weapons,
although agents protecting witnesses in Jacksonville for the trial
of reputed drug lord Carlo, said
Luis Caraballo of the governor's task force on immigration. Those
workers picked two-thirds of the crop.
   ``The fear growers have in strawberries is that you need to
replace those 17,000 with about 35,000 people to get the same
production you had before,'' he said.

<HEAD>Storm Drenches Southwest; Cold Descends On Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm system moving in from the Pacific Ocean whipped up surf
and produced scattered showers across the Southwest on Thursday,
while temperatures plunged across the Midwest and Northeast.
   Western Nevada and northern and central California received the
most widespread rainfall from the Pacific storms, which also caused
showers in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included an
inch at Fallon Naval Air Station, Nev.; a half-inch at Paso Robles,
Calif., and about four-tenths of an inch at Reno, Nev.
   A winter storm watch was in effect overnight Thursday for the
Southern California mountains, and a snow advisory was issued for
the mountains near Lake Tahoe in Nevada.
   The surf was rough not only along the coasts of Oregon and
Washington state, but also along the North Carolina coast, where a
storm was moving out to sea.
   Rain fell in parts of western New York state and western
Pennsylvania. Cold air near the Great Lakes was expected to produce
snow showers late Thursday.
   A chilly night was forecast across the Midwest, possibly
delaying the start of the growing season across illinois and
Indiana.
   A hard freeze was expected in southeast Nebraska, with
temperatures in the 20s. Forecasters warned that mild weather has
made fruit trees more susceptible to freezing temperatures than
they would normally be in mid-April.
   Cool weather extended from the northern and middle Atlantic
states across the Midwest to the northern and central Great Plains.
Readings were mostly in the 40s and 50s.
   Sunshine and mild temperatures prevailed across the Deep South.
Readings were in the 70s and lower 80s from Georgia across the
lower Mississippi Valley to much of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 92 degrees at Cotulla, Texas. The
nation's low Thursday morning was 15 degrees at Williston, N.D.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
California across the southern Rockies to western parts of the
southern Plains. Rain showers were expected from New England to the
upper Ohio Valley, with snow showers in the Great Lakes region.
   High temperatures should be in the 60s or 70s across most of the
nation; 80s in Florida and southern Georgia and from southern
Louisiana to much of Texas; 40s or 50s from New England across
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and the Ohio Valley to the upper
Mississippi Valley, and no higher than the 30s in the Great Lakes
region.

<HEAD>Meese Aide Decries GOP Senators' `Litmus Test' on Bork</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese
III on Thursday said Sen. Arlen Specter and two other Republican
opponents of former Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork had
adopted a ``personal litmus test'' in rejecting Bork's nomination.
   ``What clearly emerged during the spectacle of the Judge's
confirmation hearings was nothing less than an arrogant disdain for
government by the people,'' Assistant Attorney General William
Bradford Reynolds said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
lawyers group Thursday night in Philadelphia.
   Reynolds, who as counselor to the attorney general is Meese's
top aide, said Specter, R-Pa., and other Bork opponents had decided
last year that ``the only relevant consideration'' in Bork's
confirmation proceedings ``was a purely result-oriented one.
   That consideration, Reynolds said, was whether Bork's views on
privacy, free speech and equal protection coincide with the policy
positions ``crafted and fed to the Senators by largely hostile
staffers in collaboration with various interest'' groups.
   ``Such an inquisition makes a mockery of the Senate's
constitutional responsibility,'' Reynolds said. ``There can be
little doubt that the framers (of the Constitution) never intended
for that legislative `check' to permit judicial nominees to be held
hostage to each senator's personal litmus test.''
   He said Republican Sens. Robert Packwood of Oregon and John
Warner of Virginia, as well as Specter, had adopted the
``result-oriented'' approach in the Bork fight. He said the three
Republicans were part of a ``camp'' that included Democratic
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee: Joseph Biden of
Delaware, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Howell Heflin of Alabama and Paul
Simon of Illinois.
   Reynolds said Bork, who had been an appeals court judge in
Washington, had arrived at his views ``out of an abiding commitment
to interpret the language'' of the Constitution and the laws, ``not
recast it. ... That was, in the final analysis, his downfall.''
   The Senate rejected Bork's nomination, 58-42, last Oct. 23.
   ``Any fair reading of the record shows that I had an open mind
and decided the issue on the merits,'' Specter said in responding
to Reynolds' remarks.
   Warner responded by saying ``the nation has now turned its
focus'' on how Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ``will
discharge his responsibilities in light of the Senate's unanimous
confidence in him.''
   Packwood's press secretary, Dan Witeck, said the ``vote has been
taken'' on the Bork nomination and that the senator would have no
comment on Reynolds' remarks.

   A federal grand jury on Thursday questioned
two members of the Bender family which arranged to pay the wife of
Attorney General Edwin Meese III while leasing office space to the
Justice Department for $50 million.
   The panel, under the direction of independent counsel James
McKay, is investigating whether Meese has violated federal law
through any conflict between his personal financial interests and
his government duties.
   Accompanied by his attorney, Seymour Glanzer, Howard M. Bender
arrived at the grand jury Thursday morning. His wife, Sondra,
arrived at mid-afternoon. He spent more than three hours behind
closed doors. Later, Mrs. Bender was questioned separately for
about an hour.
   Meanwhile, trustees of the Multiple Sclerosis Society said
Thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire Ursula Meese at
$40,000 a year with money donated by the Bender family foundation.
   The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a partnership
headed by Howard Bender won a $50-million lease on Justice
Department offices after the Bender Foundation put up money to pay
Mrs. Meese's salary at the MS society.
   Meese, in Atlanta to attend a drug conference, was asked by a
reporter about the matter but declined to comment. During a stop
later at an Immigration and Nationalization Service center in
Decatur, Ga., he turned aside several questions about the lease
arrangement, saying ``that's not on the subject of immigration.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that he
knew nothing about the lease but that President Reagan ``still has
full confidence in Ed Meese.''
   MS officials have said that the Bender Foundation, of which
Sondra is president, donated the money in October 1985 to pay Mrs.
Meese for three years. Mrs. Bender and Mrs. Meese are MS trustees.
   Several MS trustees said they first learned about that
arrangement from newspaper accounts in the last two weeks. Others,
however, said the board had been advised earlier.
   Some trustees complained about not hearing earlier, but others
saw no reason for concern. Some acknowledged it was an unusual
arrangement, and all agreed it was not put up for a board vote.
   MS Trustee Susan Sikorski, wife of Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.,
said she first learned about Mrs. Meese's salary when her husband
read it in a newspaper March 30 and told her. She said the issue
was never discussed in any board meeting that she attended.
   Another trustee, Remmel Dudley, gave a different version.
   ``I guess you might say it was reported to the board,'' said
Dudley. ``I cannot say that a proposal was put before the board,
discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken, but we were
informed that this had been proposed.
   ``I was pleased. I was told the Benders had this foundation and
they could make a contribution to MS or pay for someone's salary or
designate for a specific purpose. We were delighted to know she
(Mrs. Meese) would be a full-time employee because she's a worker.''
   The board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each
meeting.
   Attorney Bryan Barkley, also a trustee, said, ``I don't recall a
discussion at a board meeting about'' the plan to hire Mrs. Meese.
   He said, ``It is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of
a specific person. That's a little unusual.'' But he added, ``It's
not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or
ratify.''
   Another long-time trustee, who spoke on condition she not be
identified, said she never missed a meeting but,``When I read the
article in the paper, I was shocked ... I was aghast when I saw
it.''
   She said she had no idea Mrs. Meese was paid as MS development
director and thought the attorney general's wife served solely on
the board as a volunteer.
   MS society attorney James Bierbower said the arrangement was
brought up in October 1985 at a special meeting to discuss
expansion of Operation Job Match, a program to help MS victims find
work. Mrs. Bender was at the session, he said.
   McKay has subpoenaed records of Mrs. Meese's job at the society.
   He also is known to be interested in a $50-million lease renewal
won by a partnership headed by Bender after Mrs. Meese got her job.
Most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the Justice
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which had
complained about the building's maintenance, size, location and
security.
   Renewal of the lease in May 1987 was crucial to the sale of the
building 13 days later for $22.6 million more than it cost the
Bender partnership just two years earlier, according to the new
owner and public records.
   The Bender partnership had bought the building in March 1985 for
nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government
wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere.
   Three months after the Bender partnership purchased the
building, the Reagan administration disclosed publicly that it had
decided to remain in there.
   An attorney for the Meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part
in the transactions, but acknowledges that the Benders and Meeses
know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss the matter. A key
government official said Meese played no role in the real estate
decision.
   Other Bender buildings have done business with the Justice
Department. Government documents show that Howard Bender and his
two brothers, Morton and Stanley, as a partnership, signed a lease
in June 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office
building, One McPherson Square, where it has leased several floors
since 1971.
   The Justice Department occupies part of one floor there.

<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem hijackers freed another
hostage from a Kuwaiti jumbo jet Thursday after negotiators resumed
their efforts to end the 10-day-old crisis.
   A man dressed in a white robe descended from the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 747 at 9:45 p.m. (5:45 EDT), got into a car and was driven
across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at Houari Boumedienne Airport.
   Algerian officials said the released hostage was a Kuwaiti named
Djuma Abdelhak Chatti. The elderly, grizzled man was greeted by
Kuwaiti officials and hustled inside the building.
   ``Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time
and I am tired,'' said Chatti, who gave his age as 70.
   ``They are not good people,'' he told reporters in the airport
lounge. ``They beat me.''
   After the release, the hijackers broadcast a message to the
control tower in Arabic and English repeating their demand for the
release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in Kuwait.
   The statement said Chatti had been released for ``strictly
humanitarian reasons.''
   Kuwait has refused the demand of the gunmen, who seized the
plane April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight and are holding at least
30 hostages.
   On Thursday evening, Kuwait's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed
Al-Osaimi, reiterated that the 17 would not be freed. Al-Osaimi is
head of a high-level Kuwaiti delegation on the scene.
   Another Kuwaiti official, speaking to reporters on condition he
not be identified, said the Algerian authorities continued to put
pressure on Kuwait to be more flexible in its position.
   ``You can see this from the fact that they are telling us that
the ball is in our court,'' the official said.
   Negotiations between the hijackers and Algerian mediators
resumed Thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day
caused by the lack of progress, according to the official Algerian
news agency.
   In Washington, lawmakers urged Secretary of State George P.
Shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers
might be responsible for kidnapping American journalist Terry
Anderson in Lebanon.
   Kuwait's independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that
the alleged kidnapper, Imad Mughniyeh, was believed to have boarded
the plane when it landed in Mashhad, Iran.
   Mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs in
Beirut for Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be the
umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   From Mashhad, the plane flew to Larnaca, Cyprus, where Palestine
Liberation Organization officials negotiated with the hijackers.
The gunmen have killed two passengers and freed 70. Among the
remaining hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat accused Iran of being behind the
hijacking and said some of the gunmen ``belong to the Iranian
government.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid echoed
Arafat's comments Thursday in Cairo.
   In a radio call to the airport tower Thursday, a passenger who
identified himself as Ahmed Zayed said: ``I ask my government to
release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us
all.''
   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, is the group that holds Anderson,
and it also is demanding the release of the 17 Kuwaiti prisoners.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held longer than any of
the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The hijackers, said to be armed with grenades and guns, have
threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages
if their demands are not met.
   A ranking Algerian official said Wednesday that Kuwait's
``intransigence'' had created the standstill.
   Algeria's negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by
Interior Minister Hedi Khediri. One team is responsible for
contacts with the Kuwaitis, and the other with the hijackers.
   A doctor was allowed on board the plane Thursday to examine the
hostages.
   ``I saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or
major medicine,'' said Dr. Youssef Mahdi. He later told the
official Algerian news agency that he prescribed some ``routine
medicines'' that would be sent to the plane.
   ``The passengers I saw did not have their hands tied and
displayed no signs of physical violence,'' Mahdi said.
   An airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food,
the Algerian official said.
   In a letter Wednesday to Shultz, Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep.
Louise Slaughter, both New York Democrats, wrote: ``We know the
United States is not a primary party to the Algiers negotiations.
But if Terry Anderson's chief kidnapper is on the Kuwaiti jet, the
United States government must insure that the negotiators are aware
of this fact.''
   ``It would be a travesty for Imad Mughniyeh to go free while
Terry Anderson remains a captive,'' they said.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, government spokesman Akis Fantis said that
the jetliner was refueled and allowed to leave for Algiers only
after Algeria gave assurances that the remaining passengers would
be freed on arrival there.
   The plane landed in Algeria on Tuesday night.
   It was moved early Thursday to the end of the runway so another
jet could land. It was later returned to its original position
about 400 yards from the terminal.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   Iraq said it fired three missiles into
Iranian cities Thursday in retaliation for an Iranian rocket that
hit Baghdad the night before.
   Iraq also reported air raids on Dezful and Hamadan in western
Iran.
   The official Iraqi news agency said the missiles hit Tehran, the
central city of Isfahan and Qom, seat of Iran's Shiite Moslem
religious hierarchy.
   Dispatches from Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said four civilians were killed and 20 wounded, and two mosques and
several houses or shops damaged by missile explosions and the air
raids on Dezful and Hamadan.
   The Iraqi agency said an Iranian missile hit a residential area
of Baghdad on Wednesday night. Iran said two rockets were fired
simultaneously at the Iraqi capital.
   ``Many civilians were killed and wounded,'' the Iraqi agency
reported.
   Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980,
began firing missiles at each other's cities since Feb. 29 and
hundreds of people have been killed. Iraq has reported launching
123 rockets and Iran has said it fired 57 into Baghdad.
   Kurdish guerrilla leader Jalal Talabani reported heavy fighting
between his men and Iraqi troops deep inside Iraq.
   Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the
main areas of battle were at Tuz, a city on the main road between
Baghdad and the northern oil city of Kirkuk, and around a town 30
miles east of Kirkuk.
   Iraq did not comment. Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for
independence from Iraq for decades.

<HEAD>Parole Commission Says Bosch To Be Freed to INS or Paroled into

   The federal parole commission Thursday said
anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch would be either released into
the custody of immigration officials on May 16 or paroled into the
community on June 16.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service says
it still plans to institute proceedings to deport Bosch from the
United States.
   Bosch, a Cuban native, came to the United States in the 1960s
and lived in the Miami area. He never became a U.S. citizen.
   Bosch entered the United States illegally in February after his
release from a Venezuelan prison, and he has been detained at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in South Dade, Fla., for violating
the terms of his parole.
   Four members of the parole commission said Bosch will be
released into the custody of the INS on May 16 if the immigration
service exercises its option to detain him. If the INS doesn't
exercise that option, he would be paroled into the community on
June 16 and would be on probation through 1992.
   Regardless of when or under what conditions he is released, the
INS plans to seek to have Bosch deported, said Duke Austin, an
immigration service spokesman.
   During any exclusionary proceedings, Bosch could be detained by
immigration officials, released on bond, released on his own
recognizance or released into the custody of family or someone else
in the community, Austin said.
   Austin said the INS had made no decision on where Bosch would be
deported if such action were approved.
   Deputy INS commissioner Mark Everson had said earlier this year
that the agency would go forward with proceedings to deport Bosch
because the United States opposes terrorism no matter who the
target is.
   Bosch, 61, was convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign
freighters and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a Polish
freighter docked in Miami. He served four years of a 10-year
federal prison sentence in the United States and has acknowledged
violating his parole when he traveled to South America in 1974. He
served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until his acquittal on charges
of bombing a Cuban jetliner in which 73 died in 1976.

<TEXT>
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said
Thursday saboteurs caused the ammunition dump explosion that killed
at least 96 people, and denied the weapons were destined for
guerrillas in neighboring Afghanistan.
   ``My personal assessment is that it couldn't be anything but a
very effective way of sabotage,'' Zia told reporters during an
informal briefing at the presidential palace. In previous comments,
Zia had not ruled out an accidental explosion.
   He said ``somebody who is not in line with us,'' was responsible
for a series of blasts at the dump between Islamabad and Rawalpindi
last Sunday that caused rockets and grenades to rain on both cities
for more than half an hour.
   Zia would not elaborate, explaining: ``I don't want to hurt the
inquiries'' being conducted into the explosion.
   Although the official death toll stands at 96, scores of people
still are listed as missing. More than 1,000 were reported injured.
   In rejecting reports that the weapons were meant for Afghan
guerrillas, he said the dump was used only by Pakistan's army.
   After the explosion, witnesses said they saw burning trucks with
Afghan license plates near the site.
   Pakistan has been a conduit for foreign military aid to Afghan
guerrillas, who have headquarters in Pakistan. The United States is
one of the countries that has supplied the rebels.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Race Issue Was Raised During Campaign In North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson denounced
President Reagan, New York Mayor Ed Koch and others for making race
and religion issues in the presidential campaign, saying they are
``making hysteria while I'm making history.''
   The preacher-turned-politician read a lengthy speech Thursday to
the annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
which he expounded his ``Jackson Doctrine'' of foreign affairs.
   ``The next president must know the world and have a realistic
understanding of our possibilities,'' Jackson said. ``Our policy
must be changed. ... We must change our course or lose our way.''
   He called for ``a new realism'' in U.S. policies and a halt to
the race to modernize the superpowers' nuclear arsenals.
   Jackson then moved back to the rhetoric he uses so well in
answering questions from the editors and later from reporters.
   Asked about those who say the nation is ``not ready for a black
president,'' Jackson said such conclusions are the result of
``journalistic incest'' among those who have not gotten out among
Americans to learn how much the nation has grown.
   ``We went across the South on Super Tuesday without a single
catcall or boo, without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting,''
Jackson said.
   Then he launched his criticism of those who have raised race in
advance of Tuesday's New York primary.
   ``It was not until we got north to New York that the litmus
tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public
officials without a significant media challenge,'' Jackson said.
``...Then joined in yesterday by the president and then joined in
today by Ms. (Geraldine) Ferraro.''
   ``I simply say some people are making hysteria while I'm making
history,'' Jackson added later at a news conference.
   Koch, who endorsed Jackson rival Sen. Albert Gore Jr. on
Thursday, said recently that Jews would ``have to be crazy'' to
vote for Jackson because of his positions on Israel.
   Reagan told the editors on Wednesday that Jackson has been
spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be
interpreted as ``some kind of racial attack.''
   ``That's a statement of trauma,'' Jackson told reporters after
the editors' speech. ``President Reagan no doubt feels the pressure
of our campaign.''
   In a speech on Wednesday night, Ms. Ferraro lauded Jackson but
added that if he ``were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.''
The former Democratic candidate for vice president said Jackson
could win neither the nomination nor the general election.
   In his foreign policy speech, Jackson said that as president he
would impose a nuclear warhead testing and missile testing
moratorium to start the process toward major reduction in both
nuclear and convention forces.
   He denounced the Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as an
expansion of the arms race, saying, ``If Star Wars takes it to the
heavens, it may soon become literally lunatic.''
   Jackson said his ``Jackson Doctrine'' has four basic principles:
   _Support for international institutions and respect for
international law.
   _Recognition for the right of self-determination for the
``struggling peoples of the Third World.''
   _Support for human rights.
   ``Gross and repeated violators of human rights should not be
recipients of U.S. aid or of trade preferences,'' he said.
   _The United State must be a force for economic growth and
justice.
   ``We will not succeed as an island of affluence in a sea of
misery and we will pay a heavy price for trying,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, faced with chants of ``Jesse Jackson, Jesse
Jackson'' by Washington toddlers: ``I'm not going to get into the
Democratic side of the equation, particularly in a day care
center.''
   
   EDWARD KOCH, New York City's mayor, endorsing Albert Gore in the
New York Democratic presidential primary: ``I believe in what Al
Gore stands for.''
   
   MARIO CUOMO, New York state's governor, on recent criticism of
Jesse Jackson by Gore and Koch: ``I'm sure that neither the mayor
nor Al Gore ... would consciously or deliberately seek to divide
people.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, saying Koch, President Reagan and former
Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro have
raised ``race-based questions'' on the eve of the New York primary:
``We went across the South on Super Tuesday without a single
cat-call or boo. ... It was not until we got north to New York that
the litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the
mouths of public officials without a significant media challenge.''
   
   ALBERT GORE, renewing his attack on Michael Dukakis involving
nuclear policy in Europe: ``To say NATO policy is `no early first
use' is another error. ... We have not adopted that policy. NATO
has not adopted that policy. ... It is the latest in a series of
statements that make the point I've tried to underscore _ that
experience in foreign policy ... is important.''

<HEAD>Indictment Hits Tax-Shelter Schemes Day Before Tax Deadline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 6,000 taxpayers cut their payments by
$88 million by claiming huge writeoffs for energy-saving devices
that may not have even worked, authorities said Thursday as they
announced the indictment of 12 people.
   The 86-count indictment handed up Thursday represents one of the
largest tax shelter frauds ever prosecuted in the United States,
said U.S. Attorney Edward S.G. Dennis Jr.
   The indictment charges that taxpayers in 47 states and the
District of Columbia paid at least $44 million to two corporations
for a stake in energy-saving devices that purportedly would give
the investors tax credits.
   The scheme cost the government $88 million for the 1982 and 1983
tax years, according to the indictment, but authorities said they
expected to recover much of the money from the taxpayers.
   ``This prosecution involves a very sophisticated attempt to lure
taxpayers into making investments that would, according to their
promoters, result in many times the investment in tax savings,''
Dennis said.
   All 12 defendants stand charged with conspiracy to defraud the
United States, aiding the filing of false tax returns and mail
fraud.
   Three defendants _ Frank J. Giuffrida, 51, of Belle Terre, N.Y.;
Salvatore Giuffrida, 47, of Dix Hills, N.Y.; and William B. Medina,
41, of Port Jeffeson, N.Y. _ are also charged with racketeering
through mail fraud and interstate transportation of money and
securities taken by fraud.
   The taxpayers did not necessarily know they were involved in an
illegal scheme, because the marketing was thoroughly professional
with videotapes, glossy brochures and seminar presentations, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tina Williams Gabbrielli, who will
prosecute the case.
   According to the indictment, two leasing companies, both based
in New York state, offered taxpayers the chance to lease an energy
device for an initial $5,000 to $25,000, depending on the model.
The companies told the taxpayers they could claim investment and
energy tax credits for the purported fair market value of the
device, ranging from $65,000 to $280,000.
   The heart of the fraud case stems from the purported fair market
value, which authorities said was actually $304 to $1,855.
   ``The figures were completedly inflated,'' Dennis said. ``Of
course, there were questions about whether there were really these
energy savings.''
   The devices, which prosecutors did not describe in detail, were
to be installed at a commercial site, which would then share any
energy savings with the taxpayer. The taxpayer in turn would pay a
portion of the electricity savings back to the leasing companies
and an array of bogus manufacturers.
   Gary H. Matthews, Philadelphia district director of the Internal
Revenue Service, said the indictment was the culmination of a
three-year investigation.
   ``We think it is time and money well spent,'' he said.
   The two leasing companies marketing the devices were OEC Leasing
Corp. of Garden City, N.Y., and First Energy Leasing Corp. of
Melville, N.Y.
   If convicted, the Giuffridas and Medina face up to 345 years
each in prison and fines ranging from $6.6 million to $10 million,
plus forfeiture of assets. The other nine, if convicted, face
prison sentences of up to 275 years and fines of up to $6.5 million.
   Also charged in the indictment were Zayle A. Bernstein, 48, Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.; William L. Eckard Jr., 46, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.;
Robert J. Cleary, 43, Levittown, N.Y.; John A. DeRaffele, 46, New
Rochelle, N.Y.; Leo I. Tobin, 48, Cherry Hill, N.J.; Irwin Berman,
55, Crystal Lake, Pa.; Michael Enden, 47, Port Washington, N.Y.;
James E. Marci, 46, Coram, N.Y.; and John Oster, 30, Miller Place,
N.Y.

   Fidel Castro won an award from the World
Health Organization for snuffing out his famous cigar and setting a
smoke-free example for his countrymen, Cuba's official news agency
said Wednesday.
   Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, director general of the Geneva-based
organization, gave Castro two medals at a ceremony Tuesday in
Havana's Palace of the Revolution, said Prensa Latina in a dispatch
received in Mexico.
   WHO announced the honor on April 7, the first worldwide ``No
Tobacco Day.'' Castro was cited for pledging in 1981 never to smoke
in public and subsequently quitting.
   Castro's cigars once were almost as much a personal trademark as
his beard.
   Guerra de Macedo noted that the medals for Castro's decision not
to smoke and for ``efforts on behalf of public health at a national
and international level'' were the first such honors given to a
chief of state, Prensa Latina said.
   It said the two discussed plans for Cuba's health services and
other health-related issues.

   An engine on a Piedmont jetliner
exploded into jagged pieces Thursday, slicing through both sides of
the plane and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing as
some passengers screamed and fainted.
   Two flight attendants suffered bumps and bruises when the plane
carrying 56 passengers plunged after the explosion, Piedmont
spokesman Don McGuire said.
   Turbine blades ripped through the right rear bathroom and a work
area for attendants as the plane cruised at 31,000 feet.
   ``If somebody had been in the bathroom or the stewardesses'
quarters, they would have been killed,'' said passenger Doug Bruce
of Columbus, Ohio. ``My first thought was, `This is it.'''
   ``It blew a big hole in the plane,'' said passenger Fred Hinton
of Raleigh, N.C., ``I'm 240 pounds, and it was big enough that I
could crawl through it.''
   ``All the kids were screaming,'' Hinton said.
   Piedmont Flight 486 was flying from Charlotte, N.C., to
Columbus, Ohio, when its right jet turbine disintegrated about 9:45
a.m., Piedmont officials said. The plane, a Fokker F-28, has two
engines, one mounted on each side of the cabin.
   The plane, 40 miles south of Charleston, immediately lost air
pressure in the cabin; several passengers later complained of
headaches, earaches and elevated blood pressure.
   ``It began with a wearing noise and loud vibrations about five
or 10 times straight, and then there was an explosion in the back
of us,'' said passenger Rafael Gonzalez of Charlotte, N.C.
   Turbine blades and engine parts ripped through the fuselage,
punching holes in both sides of the plane. A hole on the right
side, adjacent to the engine that disintegrated, was 2 feet wide by
6 feet tall. On the opposite side, the hole was 2 feet by 1 foot.
   The pilot noticed a fire indicator signal for his No. 2 engine,
manufactured by Rolls Royce, and decided to land at Charleston,
where he ``landed without incident'' at Yeager Airport, about 10
a.m., McGuire said.
   Assistant airport manager Dan Huffman said the F-28 was 40 miles
south of Charleston and traveling north when the explosion occurred.
   The plane made a deep descent after the explosion ``but they got
it under control. They all did a good job,'' Hinton said.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator was
dispatched to Charleston to investigate, airport officials said.
   Piedmont owns 25 of the German-built F-28 4000s, said another
Piedmont spokesman, Bill Kress. Piedmont uses the jets, slightly
smaller than Boeing 737s or McDonnell-Douglass DC9s, because many
airports in its mountainous region have short runways.
   Charleston's airport, named for test pilot Gen. Chuck Yeager, is
located atop a mountain 2 miles north of the downtown area.
   Immediately after the explosion, oxygen masks dropped from the
ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers went through the
aisles and assisted children, passengers said.
   But some masks didn't work and passengers had to be moved to
other seats.
   Gonzalez, who was sitting three rows from the rear of the plane,
said a woman in the seat behind him who was traveling with two
children passed out.
   ``She fainted. I turned around and she was blue. The baby was
blue. And her 3-year-old was blue,'' Gonzales said. ``I grabbed her
and put a mask on her, gave the baby to a woman who was sitting
next to her and I took the 3-year-old up with me.''
   About 90 minutes after the emergency landing, most passengers
were placed on Flight 249, a Charleston-to-Chicago nonstop flight
that was diverted to Columbus. However, a few passengers flocked to
rental car companies; they planned to continue their trip by car.
   Before Flight 249 took off for Columbus and Chicago, paramedics
checked the blood pressure of several passengers.
   ``It's a little high,'' Hinton said of his own blood pressure.
``But if I don't get on that plane today, I'll have trouble flying
again.''
   The NTSB has on file only two injury-related accidents involving
Fokker F-28s, said spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz in Washington, D.C.
One jet was involved in a minor taxiway collision in 1985, and in
1986, an unassisted handicapped passenger fell off the boarding
stairs when a guardrail gave way, he said.
   During the past 4{ years, only seven Piedmont flights resulted
in injuries to passengers, the records show. The worst was on Oct.
25, 1986, when a jet overshot a Charlotte runway, causing three
serious injuries and 31 minor ones.
   On Aug. 10, 1968, a Piedmont plane crashed on approach to the
Charleston airport, killing 35 people.

   Early results from blind AIDS tests among
hospital patients show three in 1,000 infected with the virus that
causes the deadly disease, according to a report released Thursday
by federal health officials.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in one attempt to
gauge the prevalence of infection with the virus that causes AIDS,
has launched a program to test anonymously blood samples taken from
hospital patients at 40 hospitals in 30 cities.
   So far, just four hospitals have been enrolled in the program,
all in the Midwest. All patients are being tested except those who
already have AIDS or related conditions.
   In results from the four Midwestern hospitals, 0.3 percent of
the 12,000 patients tested showed signs of infection by the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, the CDC said in a report
Thursday.
   Federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1
million and 1.5 million Americans _ from 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent
_ are infected with AIDS virus. ``No new data have become available
to prompt a change of this estimate,'' the CDC said.
   The Atlanta-based CDC stressed that it is in the earliest stages
of the hospital study. ``Accurate estimates of the prevalence ...
of (AIDS virus) infection in the entire U.S. population are not
possible at this time,'' the agency said.
   ``These data are from just one region; they are not
(necessarily) representative of the nation,'' said Dr. Tim Dondero,
a CDC AIDS specialist. ``You can't do a national estimate based on
four spots.''
   The CDC expects to enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing
program by September.
   At the four hospitals reporting first, antibodies indicating
infection by AIDS virus were more common among adults age 25 to 44.
Rates also were higher for black and Hispanic persons than for
whites, and higher for men than for women, the CDC said.
   The CDC report also reviewed tests among prisoners and among
childbearing women.
   Out of 29,193 federal inmates tested by the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons since last June, 843, or 2.9 percent, have tested positive
for AIDS virus infection. That is little changed from a Justice
Department announcement last fall, when 3 percent of the first
inmates tested were positive.
   The CDC said it hopes to contract with the National Institute of
Justice and with a major university for AIDS testing of 10,000
inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this June.
   In 52,326 tests of childbearing women in the state of New York,
researchers found an AIDS virus infection rate of 0.8 percent, the
CDC said. In New York City, one woman in 61 showed antibodies
against the AIDS virus, and 40 percent of those women passed the
infections on to their newborn children, the CDC added.
   As of this week, 59,287 cases of AIDS itself have been reported
in the United States, according to the CDC. The disease has so far
killed 33,060, or 56 percent of those patients.

   Soviet media on Thursday called the Afghanistan
accord in Geneva ``the news we've been waiting so long for,'' but
there was only sketchy mention of the Kremlin's commitment to bring
its soldiers home.
   Radio Moscow used only one sentence to sum up the consequences
of the pact for the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops deployed in
Afghanistan.
   ``It was agreed that the withdrawal of Soviet troops is to start
on May 15, and to be completed within nine months,'' it said.
   Other media reports, including state-run television's top
evening news broadcast, made no reference to the pullout at all.
   Instead, most reports emphasized that the goal of the pact is
the peaceful settlement of Afghanistan's 10-year-old civil war, and
reiterated Soviet backing for the embattled Marxist government of
President Najib.
   Most Soviets, however, would be aware of the implications of the
accords. Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has called
the Afghan involvement his nation's ``bleeding wound,'' said last
week that the pullout would begin in mid-May if the U.N.-brokered
Geneva negotiations were successful.
   Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev sent troops into Afghanistan on
Dec. 27, 1979, to preside over the replacement of one Marxist
leader by another.
   They stayed on to help combat a nationwide insurgency in a
military operation that has cost thousands of Soviet lives and
billions of rubles, sparked domestic dissent, and poisoned the
Kremlin's relations with other Moslem and Third World nations.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was sent into
internal exile for almost seven years after criticizing the
intervention, called the agreement signed in Geneva ``an enormous
event.''
   ``It was a horrible war, a horrible mistake by the Soviet
leadership that had awful consequences for the Afghan people,''
said Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, who was reached by
telephone at his Moscow apartment.
   ``I am waiting with great impatience for May 15 to see the troop
withdrawal begin,'' he added.
   From the U.S. withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty and
the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics by the United States and 61
other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements
involving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sending
tanks and troops across the Afghan border.
   A Moscow newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter of
receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in
Afghanistan. ``Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of the
letter said. ``But what did my boy die for?''
   The U.S. State Department has estimated Soviet casualties since
1979 at 33,000-38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.
Those figures do not include ``heavy losses'' to disease, the
department said in a report issued in December.
   The agreement signed by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
and U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz commits the Kremlin to
ending its military intervention.
   State-run media's initial reporting on the Geneva agreements
seemed designed to assure Soviets that their government's stated
goal of achieving peace in Afghanistan's civil war had been met, at
least in part.
   Shevardnadze, in a statement to reporters after the ceremony,
spoke not of the withdrawal of Soviet troops but of the end to all
outside interference in Afghanistan mandated by the agreements.
   ``The entire spectrum of possible activities and actions to
meddle in the affairs of Afghanistan has finally been blocked,'' he
said, in remarks reported by the official Tass news agency and
shown on Soviet TV.
   ``Outside interference'' has been the term used by Soviets to
describe the aid by the United States and other countries to
Afghanistan's anti-Marxist Mujahedeen insurgents.
   Shevardnadze said he wanted to do ``justice'' to the U.S. role
in bringing about an Afghan settlement, but depicted the Soviet
Union as the major peacemaker.
   The Afghan pact, he said, ``has been predetermined by my
country's policy of solving acute international problems
exceptionally by political means, which has been proclaimed by
Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   ``Vremya,'' the evening news program, made no mention at all
Thursday night of the troop withdrawal.
   The newcast, with an estimated audience of 150 million, began
with reports on the regular Thursday meeting of the ruling
Politburo, the construction of an atomic icebreaker, and private
farming plots in a region of the Russian federation.
   About 20 minutes into the broadcast, ``Vremya'' showed an
eight-minute report on what a correspondent in Geneva called a
``historic event of exceptional international importance.''
   Another newscaster on state-run TV also waxed eloquent in
reporting the agreements, which were also signed by top diplomats
from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   ``Today in the World,'' an evening program, led off with a
highly unusual editorial comment from anchorman Igor Kudrin, who
told viewers, ``We begin today with news that we've been waiting so
long for.''
   On Feb. 8, Gorbachev said the future political system of
Afghanistan was ``none of our business,'' and stressed that the
Soviet Union had dropped a previous condition that a coalition
government be formed before the beginning of a military withdrawal.
   Shevardnadze on Thursday reiterated Kremlin backing for Najib,
saying what is crucial in Afghanistan is ``every kind of support
for the success of the national reconcilation policy'' proclaimed
last year by the Afghan leader.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. picked up the presidential
primary endorsement Thursday, for better or for worse, of Mayor
Edward Koch who told a news conference: ``I'm available. Have shoes
and mouth and will travel.''
   ``I believe in what Al Gore stands for,'' Koch said, singling
out the Tennessee senator's positions on urban affairs, defense and
Israel.
   At a City Hall news conference, Gore often appeared stiff as he
was relegated to a bit part, standing next to the irrepressible
mayor who bantered with reporters and mugged for cameras.
   The other dominant figure in New York Democratic politics, Gov.
Mario Cuomo, has refused to endorse anyone, saying he would withold
his backing until after the last primaries on June 7.
   New Yorkers vote Tuesday and Koch was asked what impact his
endorsement might have. With an exaggerated shrug of his shoulders
and a glance around a room that was filled to capacity, he said:
``Oh, probably nothing. That's why you're here.''
   The first question after Koch read a statement endorsing Gore
was whether he feared that a vote for Gore would help Jesse Jackson
by siphoning away votes from Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``That's exactly what I'm against,'' replied Koch ``voting for
someone to stop someone else.''
   Koch stirred a controversy last week when he said that Jews and
other supporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to vote for
Jackson.
   Later on Thursday, Dukakis and Jackson had temperate responses
to Koch's endorsement.
   ``We had a very good discussion last night,'' Dukakis said in
Boston. ``He said that if I won the nomination, he would campaign
for me and with me, and I appreciate that.''
   Koch had said the choice was between Gore and Dukakis, who
added, ``He likes us both.''
   In Washington, Jackson said endorsements are positive.
   ``What he has done by choosing someone is positive and fair and
proper,'' Jackson told reporters after a speech to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   But Jackson did condemn what he called Koch's ``race-based
statements.''
   ``It was not until we got north to New York that the litmus
tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public
officials without a significant media challenge,'' Jackson said,
singling out Koch, President Reagan and former Democratic vice
presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
   At the endorsement news conference he said he was prepared to
support the candidate nominated by the Democrats at their
convention in Atlanta in July.
   Koch said his reason for supporting Jackson ``would not be
because I believe in his positions, but I believe he'd be less
destructive than the presidency of George Bush.''
   Then he added, ``If he (Jackson) wants me to go out and make
that statement, I'd be happy to go anywhere.''
   As for Dukakis _ regarded as the front-runner in the race for
the 255 delegates at stake in New York's on Democratic primary _
Koch said he called the Massachusetts governor to inform him he had
decided to support Gore.
   ``He was very charming about it,'' said the mayor. ``Very nice
about it. He made it easier.''
   Did he call Jackson?
   ``No, he was never in the running,'' said the mayor.
   Koch and Dukakis met for nearly an hour Wednesday night at
Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence. Neither man commented after
the meeting. Koch had a similar session with Gore Tuesday night.
   Asked about Gore's chances of overcoming the big lead polls give
Dukakis in the race, Koch recalled that when he ran for the
Democratic nomination for governor in 1982 against Mario Cuomo ``I
started out 40-plus points ahead of any other candidate and I upset
the odds.'' Cuomo won that primary and went on to be elected
governor.
   Koch brushed off suggestions that his support might hurt Gore
among some New York voters, particularly Hispanics. The mayor said
that Hispanics are among his strongest supporters despite criticism
from community leaders who objected to Koch's refusal to accede to
their demand that his appoint a Hispanic to the board of education.

<HEAD>Mecham Attorneys Reportedly Seek Deal on Criminal Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham said Thursday he
wouldn't agree to leave the state in exchange for the dismissal of
criminal charges against him, as his lawyers reportedly proposed.
   The former governor, who was removed from office April 4 when
convicted in his Senate impeachment trial, insisted in a radio
interview he did not know about the alleged proposal by two of his
lawyers.
   Mecham, interviewed on KTAR radio, said: ``I would have made no
deal with anybody that I would leave the state for two years. I've
done nothing wrong.''
   ``I'm in the middle of things in Arizona, and I don't plan to go
away,'' the former governor said.
   State Sen. Bill De Long said Wednesday that the two lawyers met
with state Attorney General Bob Corbin in an attempt to get the
criminal charges against Mecham dropped.
   De Long said he understood the meeting occurred last week, but
Corbin would not say whether the meeting took place. Mecham, De
Long and Corbin are Republicans.
   ``Maybe somebody had some conversations,'' Mecham said, but he
added that the lawyers reportedly involved were not those handling
his criminal case. ``I can't say it didn't happen. I didn't know of
it,'' he said.
   Mecham has repeatedly said he expects to be acquitted in his May
19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   In a related development, his criminal-case attorney, Michael
Scott, filed a special action in the Arizona Supreme Court seeking
dismissal of the charges on grounds that Corbin manipulated the
grand jury process in seeking the indictment. A lower court judge
had previously refused to dismiss the charges.
   De Long said Mecham's impeachment trial lawyers, Fred Craft and
Jerris Leonard, approached him a week ago and asked him to set up a
meeting with Corbin to discuss the possibility of having the
criminal charges dropped.
   ``It was a dismissal in return for certain concessions on the
part of the respondent, and while I did not hear all of the
details, I did act as an intermediary for a meeting to be set up,''
De Long said.
   Craft and Leonard did not return calls placed to their
Washington, D.C. office.
   Corbin said he would treat Mecham ``just like I treat anybody
else.''
   Scott said he previously had asked Chief Assistant Attorney
General Steve Twist to dismiss some of the counts but that he had
never approached the attorney general with a suggestion similar to
the one made to De Long.
   ``Craft and Leonard did come to me after the Senate trial and
asked what I thought about them talking to someone,'' he said. ``I
told them it was OK with me, but if they were going to the attorney
general's office, I thought it would be a waste of time. For that
reason, I didn't bother going with them.''
   The concessions that Leonard and Craft suggested to him would
include Mecham leaving the state for a two-year Mormon mission,
calling off political backers who are targeting some legislators
for defeat next fall and promising never to run for office again,
De Long said.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, face charges of fraud, perjury
and filing false documents for failing to report a $350,000
campaign loan from a Tempe developer to Mecham's 1986 campaign.
   In other developments, state Treasurer Ray Rottas said he might
refuse to release state funds for Mecham's impeachment trial
defense. Corbin said he would issue an opinion on whether the
Senate had the authority to agree to pay $202,000 to Mecham's
lawyers.
   The state Senate Government Committee, reversing a stand it took
last year, voted Thursday for a state holiday to honor Martin
Luther King Jr. The sponsor, Democratic Sen. Carolyn Walker, said
that if the bill gets through the Republican caucus to the Senate
floor, she believes both houses would approve it.
   Mecham caused a storm of controversy shortly after taking office
in January 1986 by rescinding a limited King holiday for
executive-branch employees, arguing his predecessor had no legal
right to create it. Although Mecham said he did so on the advice of
Corbin, the action generated an international controversy.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said
Thursday that he and at least 53 other members of Puerto Rico's
delegation will vote for Michael Dukakis at the Democratic National
Convention because of commitments Dukakis has made to help this
U.S. commonwealth.
   But Jesse Jackson, who won the non-binding beauty contest
primary here, said his campaign would look into the situation and
perhaps challenge the decision.
   ``We do not know all the details behind that. Suffice to say, it
is radically inconsistent in a democracy for the people to go in
one direction and the delegates to go in another direction,''
Jackson told a Washington news conference.
   ``It's premature to respond. We will seek clarity,'' he added.
``There should be a reaonsable correlation between popular votes
and delegates votes in a democracy.''
   Dukakis as president would end discrimination and provide just
treatment in welfare, Medicaid and other federal programs for
Puerto Ricans on this Caribbean island as well as on the U.S.
mainland, Hernandez Colon said at a news conference.
   And if Puerto Ricans vote in a referendum on political status to
reject statehood and keep the current commonwealth form of
government, Dukakis would ``submit to Congress the necessary
measures to strengthen commonwealth,'' Hernandez Colon said.
   Puerto Rico will send 56 voting delegates to the national
convention. The majority decided at a meeting of Hernandez Colon's
Popular Democratic Party last Thursday to endorse Dukakis, Senate
President Miguel Hernandez Agosto said.
   ``No one spoke in favor of Jesse Jackson or Albert Gore,'' said
Cirolo Tirado Jr., the PDP's youth coordinator and a delegate-elect
whose selection will be confirmed at a party caucus on April 24.
   ``It was unanimous in favor of Dukakis,'' said Connie
Carasquillo, a delegate who also attended.
   
   Hernandez Colon and Hernandez Agosto endorsed Dukakis at a news
conference Wednesday in New York. Initially, it was unclear how
many delegates they represented because most either were elected
March 20 on a non-committed slate, or have yet to be formally
appointed.
   Hernandez Agosto said Thursday that most of the 33 delegates
elected last month attended last week's meeting, as did the 18
delegates-elect who formally will be appointed later this month.
   The main issues in the March 20 primary were local. The PDP and
the out-of-power New Progressive Party, which favors statehood,
each submitted their own slates. The PDP, which favors
commonwealth, won in every district. Members of the other party
will have two delegates to the convention.
   A non-binding straw poll was held the same day. Jackson finished
first with about 32 percent of the vote, but Hernandez Colon and
Hernandez Agosto stressed even then that the delegates were not
bound by the results of the poll.
   Hernandez Colon, whose son works in the Dukakis campaign, and
Hernandez Agosto met with Dukakis Wednesday in Boston. Both said
they will campaign this weekend for Dukakis in New York, which has
large Puerto Rican communities. The New York primary is set for
next Tuesday.
   Puerto Rico, located 1,000 miles southeast of Florida, is a U.S.
territory whose residents are U.S. citizens with most every right
and obligation except they cannot vote for president and they pay
no federal taxes.

<HEAD>Court Spokesman Says Hamadi Could Get Life from Juvenile Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court spokesman on Thursday
confirmed reports from Washington that a juvenile court could
sentence Mohammed Hamadi to life in prison if he is convicted in
the 1985 TWA hijacking.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday that
West German authorities had informed American officials a juvenile
court could sentence Hamadi as an adult and give him life, the
maximum sentence, if he is found guilty of murder and air piracy.
   Thomas Kehren, spokesman for the Hesse state court, said the
juvenile court could decide to deal with Hamadi as adult.
   ``The juvenile court in fact has more leeway in handling this
case and sentencing him if he's found guilty,'' he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   ``If it determines Hamadi was more juvenile than adolescent, the
maximum sentence is 10 years. If found more adolescent than an
adult, 10 to 15 years, and if the court decided he was an adult, up
to life imprisonment.''
   Hamadi awaits trial on charges that he led the June 1985
hijacking to Beirut of TWA Flight 847 during which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17
days.
   On Tuesday, the Hesse state court said it had turned Hamadi's
case over to a juvenile court because there was doubt about his
exact age at the time he allegedly began planning the hijacking.
   West German law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of
age, an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or
over. Personality development and family environment also play a
role in determining what category is applicable, the newspaper
Frankfurt Allgemeine said Thursday.
   Files in the Hesse prosecutor's office give Hamadi's birth date
as June 13, 1964, which would have made him 21 the day the
hijacking began on June 14, 1985.
   Asked how long the juvenile court would study the case before
setting a trial date, Kehren said: ``My guess would be in a month,
maybe a little longer. But to say six months as some have been
asking about is in my opinion way off the mark.''
   The United States asked West Germany to extradite Hamadi on
murder and hijacking charges, but the West Germans turned down the
request and said he would be tried here.
   Mohammed Hamadi's brother Abbas is on trial in West Germany on
charges of kidnapping two West Germans in Lebanon to use as ransom
for the release of his brother. One of the hostages has been freed.
   Both Hamadis were living in West Germany when they were arrested
two weeks apart at the Frankfurt airport in January 1987 on charges
of possessing explosives.

   Democratic leaders dropped compromise efforts
Thursday and vowed to push forward with a sweeping trade bill
containing a controversial plant-closing provision in defiance of
White House veto threats.
   The decision reversed a drive one day earlier in which the
leaders had sought to persuade union representatives to accept
dropping the plant-closing provision to avoid a threatened veto by
President Reagan.
   As a result of the decision, the fate of the sweeping,
1,000-page trade bill that Congress has been fashioning for three
years was placed in jeopardy.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said an expanding trade
gap demonstrated that ``now is not the time to let the trade bill
go down the tubes, but that is exactly what will happen if the
plant-closing and the foreign investment-disclosure provisions
remain in the package.''
   Another target of administration veto warnings has been a
provision that would require public disclosure of sizeable foreign
investment in the United States. Lawmakers have not decided yet
whether to include that measure in the trade bill.
   Democrats said the reversal came amid intense pressure Thursday
morning on House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, from within the
Democratic Caucus not to abandon unions in their quest for the
plant-closings provisions. They said the United Auto Workers and
other labor groups lobbied furiously Wednesday night and Thursday
morning to build support among caucus members.
   ``Unfortunately, a single issue has emerged that threatens to
defeat the entire bill,'' said House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill. ``I hope in the coming days that the
president, members of Congress, business and labor groups will
carefully consider the price the nation will pay if we fail to
enact this essential legislation.''
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper issued a reminder that six
Cabinet officers wrote to lawmakers ``two weeks ago telling the
Hill that they would recommend a veto if plant closings was in the
bill.''
   But a statement from Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., indicated that they would press forward with the
bill including the plant-closings provision.
   ``We have consulted extensively with our colleagues,'' a
statement from Democratic leaders said. ``Given today's trade
figures and the resulting plunge in the stock market, we now
believe strongly that we should move as quickly as possible with a
strong trade and competitiveness bill, including protections for
workers who are about to be laid off or whose plants are about to
close.''
   The statement said that they had ``gone more than halfway to
meet administration concerns.''
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who
had long campaigned for such a measure, said that he expected the
Senate to take up the bill within the next several weeks and
predicted overwhelming support for it.
   ``Concern for the trade numbers hardens support for the bill as
it stands, and when the market fell, that tilted it to the final
decision to go ahead,'' Bentsen said in a statement.
   Earlier Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
trade deficit widened dramatically in February to $13.8 billion,
its biggest shortfall since October and the second straight
increase. Wall Street reacted with a 101.46 drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
   The plant-closing provision would require companies with at
least 100 employees to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and
layoffs involving at least one-third of their work force. Layoffs
of 500 or more, even if less than one-third of the work force,
would have to be preceded by notice.
   Democrats said that another key factor that prompted Wright's
decision to press forward with the provision was intense pressure
within the Democratic Caucus, many of whose members were lobbied
heavily by labor unions.
   Labor, which was counting on the provision, already was rankled
after lawmakers jettisoned a provision of the bill sponsored by
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., calling for 10 percent rollbacks
in Japanese and several other nations' trade surpluses with the
United States.
   Thursday's decision came as a surprise after the leaders met
behind closed doors Wednesday with union leaders and urged them to
accept dropping the plant-closings provision, which critics have
said would be too burdensome for business.
   Top Reagan administration officials met briefly with
congressional leaders Thursday to discuss trade legislation and
then slipped away without commenting on results of the meeting.
   ``We're still exploring it,'' Wright told reporters after the
30-minute, closed-door session with Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III and White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.
   Wright was asked about reports that lawmakers were unwilling to
drop the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill's controversial
plant-closings provision without a guarantee that it would assure
that the president would sign the rest of the measure.
   ``I think they understand that,'' Wright said.
   The plant-closings plan is among scores of provisions of the
trade bill. The central provisions would transfer authority to the
U.S. trade representative to retaliate against violations of
international agreements and other ``unjustifiable acts.'' The
president now has that power.
   Other central provisions would streamline the machinery under
which the government imposes import curbs to aid American
businesses threatened by surges in imported goods.
   Meanwhile, Gephardt told reporters that the plant-closings
provision should stay in the trade bill and that a number of
Democrats would abandon their support of the legislation if the
labor-backed provision were dropped.
   He said it was by no means clear that Reagan would veto the bill
if the measure contained plant-closings when it reached his desk.

   The Supreme Court denied the bid of convicted
killer Earl Clanton Jr. of Virginia for a stay of execution
Thursday night.
   The vote was 7-2, with Justices William Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissenting, said spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.
   In addition, the court denied a petition for certiorari that
would have led to a rehearing of the case, she said.
   The court acted at 7:50 p.m. EDT on the applications filed about
2{ hours earlier, Ms. Arberg said. The execution was scheduled for
11 p.m.
   Clanton, 33, was convicted of the November 1980 robbery and
strangling of Wilhemina Smith, a school librarian who lived in the
same apartment building where Clanton lived.

   Top Soviet health officials said Thursday that
an anthrax outbreak that killed 64 people in Sverdlovsk eight years
ago was caused by contaminated meat, not an accident at a
germ-warfare laboratory.
   The officials, including Dr. Petr N. Burgasov, the Soviet's
deputy minister of health at the time, made the comments during a
conference on the disease at the Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health.
   ``There is no reason for any suspicion,'' said Burgasov, who
along with two companions had treated victims in Sverdlovsk. ``If
there had been an explosion, not 96 people would have been
affected, but literally hundreds of thousands of people.''
   The officials offered a detailed explanation of the April 1979
accident, discounting sketchy reports at the time by U.S. officials
that it was caused by exposure to a lethal biological agent.
   The Soviet explanation, presented first in Washington earlier
this week, has been hailed by U.S. academicians as the most
detailed, public account of the outbreak.
   The three Soviet doctors said they are spending a week in the
United States attempting to convince Western physicians, scholars
and politicians of their explanation.
   Burgasov acknowledged that the Soviets' failure to disclose the
incident led to suspicion in the West. ``The fact that there was no
data given at the time always leads to suspicion,'' he said.
   The disease, which is caused by a bacteria, killed 64 of the 96
people it afflicted, Burgasov said, speaking through an interpreter
at a lecture attended by about 100 people.
   Anthrax, which also kills cattle, is transmitted most commonly
by contact with infected animals, according to the Oxford Textbook
of Medicine.
   Burgasov and Dr. Vladimir Sergiyev said the disease was traced
back to a bone-meal animal feed that had been improperly processed
at a Soviet manufacturing plant.
   The meal was fed to animals who subsequently died. The meat was
sold privately and illegally to people in Sverdlovsk, the doctors
said.
   ``In 1979 there was very little meat (in the region),'' Burgasov
said. ``Meat was a luxury, it was used only on special occasions.''
   He said children did not become sick because they were fed daily
at child care centers with food that came from a central
distribution center.
   Vegetarians and people who did not eat the underground meat did
not get sick, Burgasov said. ``This is why we became suspicious of
the meat.''
   ``All of the tragedy of this illness passed right before my
eyes,'' said Dr. Vladimir Nikiforov, an expert in infectious
diseases who treated many of the victims.
   Using graphic slides, Nikiforov showed symptoms of the two types
of anthrax _ contaneous and gastrointestinal _ that afflicted
victims in Sverdlovsk.
   Those who had contaneous anthrax, characterized by lesions on
the skin, eventually recovered. Victims of gastrointestinal
anthrax, in which the disease infects the stomach and intestines,
died within a two days of toxic shock, Nikiforov said.
   Dr. Alexander Langmuir, a former chief epidemiologist at the
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he finds the
Soviet account credible.
   Langmuir, who moderated the discussion at Johns Hopkins, said he
expects to learn more during the remainder of the Soviets' stay.
   Anthrax expert Dr. Philip Brachman of Emory Univeristy called
the Soviets' presentation in Washington a ``landmark report'' in an
interview Tuesday with the Washington Post.
   Brachman said the Soviet doctors provided ``a pretty good
indication that this incident was an outbreak of gastrointestinal
anthrax'' caused by contaminated meat.

   Defense lawyers looked to Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles for a last-minute reprieve Thursday night for Earl Clanton
Jr., scheduled to die in the electric chair for strangling a
neighbor during a 1980 robbery.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-2 vote Thursday night, denied the
33-year-old Clanton a stay. Justices William Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   Marie Deans of the Virginia Coalition on Jails and Prisons, an
organization that finds attorneys for death sentence appeals, said
a request for clemency would be presented to the governor.
   Earlier, Clanton was taken to a room adjacent to the State
Penitentiary's death chamber for a scheduled 11 p.m. execution.
   It would be the seventh death sentence carried out in Virginia
and the 98th in the nation since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
allowing states to resume use of the death penalty.
   The appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court had centered on abuse
Clanton contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until
after being sentenced to death in 1981.
   Clanton was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the
Mecklenburg Correctional Center in 1984. He was recaptured a day
later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at
a coin laundry in Warrenton, N.C.
   Earlier Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals unanimously overturned a stay that U.S. District
Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. had granted Tuesday.
   Merhige said he wanted to conduct a hearing on arguments that
Clanton was incompetent and unable to assist in his defense when a
Petersburg jury convicted him of the murder of Wilhemina Smith, a
school librarian who lived in his apartment building.
   The appeal cited a psychiatric report saying Clanton suppressed
memories of his violent childhood, thus hampering defense efforts
to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life
sentence.
   The appeals panel said Clanton's case had been given least 10
reviews in state and federal courts and his sentencing had been
found constitutional.
   In addition, the appeals court said, Clanton's attorney had
failed during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse
after Clanton had disclosed it.
   At his 1981 trial, Clanton refused his lawyer's request to
submit to a psychiatric examination, and the only mitigating
evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that
he attended Bible classes while in jail awaiting trial.
   After the trial, Clanton said he was beaten as a child by his
father and was sexually abused by his stepmother. After leaving his
father, he moved to New Jersey to live with his mother but got into
trouble there and was convicted of a murder. He was later paroled.

<HEAD>Salaries Climb For 1987-88 Graduates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum engineers commanded the highest
starting salary among recent college graduates, earning an average
of $33,840, according to a survey issued Thursday.
   The salary level represented a gain of nearly 10 percent since
July, while job offers climbed 36 percent, said the report by the
private, non-profit, College Placement Council.
   ``The college recruiting picture for 1987-88 continues to look
bright, if average salary offers are an indication,'' the survey
said.
   Only inexperienced master's of business administration
candidates with non-technical undergraduate degrees saw a drop in
salary offers. Their salaries fell 4.4 percent since July to
$30,480.
   Experienced MBA graduates with non-technical degrees received
higher offers, as did inexperienced MBA graduates with technical
backgrounds.
   The average salary offers for mechanical engineers climbed 3.8
percent to $29,388, while the average for electrical engineers went
up 1.4 percent to $29,316. Chemical engineers earned $30,768, a 3.1
percent increase.
   Salary offers for accounting graduates jumped to an average of
$23,700 a year, up more than 9 percent since July. Salaries for
graduates in marketing and distribution rose 2.7 percent to $20,904.
   Banking-finance graduates averaged $21,792, while human resource
graduates averaged $19,212, about the same as in January.
   In the allied health field, offers ranged from $19,440 to
$30,000, with an average of $24,660, about the same as in January.
   Salaries for nurses fell slightly since January. In this latest
report, they ranged from $18,996 to $28,368 and averaged $23,604.
   Salaries for computer science graduates rose slightly since
July, for an average of $26,676, but job offers declined 2 percent
from this time last year.
   Computer programmers were offered $20,064 to $30,492 and
averaged $25,944, which represents a slight increase since July.
   Of all job offers made to graduates with bachelor's degrees, 53
percent went to non-technical graduates while 47 percent were
extended to technical graduates.
   Public accounting employers made the most offers to
non-technical graduates, offering 45 percent of their entry level
jobs at an average salary of $24,024.
   The aerospace industry continued to provide the most job offers
to technical graduates, offering 16.5 percent of entry level jobs
at an average pay of $29,280.
   Comparing salaries around the nation, the survey found that New
York City employers offered the highest average salaries to
accounting graduates, $27,408.
   Aerospace engineers commanded the highest salaries of $28,776 in
St. Louis, Mo., while electrical engineers there commanded the
highest average of $30,144. Chemical engineers received an average
salary offer of $31,428 from employers in Houston, Texas.
   The College Placement Council represents career planning nd
placement directors of 1,300 U.S. colleges and universities, as
well as the nation's leading corporate and government recruiting
organizations.
   The organization has conducted such surveys for more than 20
years.
   The current survey, which covered the period from Sept. 1 to
March 7, includes several new categories covering different periods
of time, making some comparisons with last year's data impossible,
the organization said.

   A car bomb blew up in front of a club for
U.S. military personnel in Naples on Thursday, killing five people
and wounding at least 17, Italian officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast
that happened shortly after 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) at the USO club.
   The Pentagon initially reported one sailor was killed and four
injured, but Navy Cmdr. Connie Haney later said authorities in
Naples could not confirm any U.S. military deaths. He said three
sailors were hurt.
   Italian media quoted officials as saying three men and two women
died in the blast. Witnesses said one of the bodies at the entrance
of the club was draped in a U.S. flag.
   Italian hospital officials said at least four Americans were
among the injured.
   Italian media said the bomb exploded during a reception at the
club for the commander of the USS Paul, a torpedo boat destroyer
docked in Naples. A U.S. Consulate official could not confirm the
report.
   Passers-by screamed and ran when the explosion occurred outside
the club, which is in one of Naples' busiest areas.
   ``It was a huge boom and we were all knocked to the ground. When
we got up, all we could see was flames everywhere,'' an
unidentified Italian woman told the state-run RAI television
network from her hospital bed.
   ``We can confirm there are no fatalities from the three ships in
port,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Pentagon spokesman, adding
that there was a possibility that ``there could be a sailor dead
from the local command,'' although he knew of no such death.
   The ships were the USS Paul, based in Mayport, Fla.; the USS
Capodanno, with a home port in Newport, R.I.; and the USNS Kaiser,
a fueling vessel with no specific base, the Pentagon said.
   Two crew members from the USS Capodanno and one from the USS
Paul were being treated for injuries in Naples, Haney said in a
statement. One crew member from the Capodanno was treated and
released, it said.
   The Pentagon did not immediately release the names of the
injured.
   The initial report of a dead sailor was the result of confusion
following the blast, Haney said.
   A spokesman for Pellegrini Hospital said 14 of the wounded,
including four Americans and eight Italians, were taken to a
hospital.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified,
said the Americans later were sent to a U.S. military hospital. He
said he had no details on the extent of the injuries.
   RAI said one of the wounded, a 27-year-old Italian woman, was
reported in grave condition.
   It said 60 to 70 people were inside the club at the time of the
explosion.
   ``The entire scene is apocalyptic,'' said Naples Mayor Pietro
Lezzi, as he surveyed the damage.
   Antonio Barrel, the inspector general of public security in
Naples, told the Italian news agency ANSA that authorities do not
yet know if the car bomb was set by foreigners or Italians.
   But the agency also quoted an unidentified police official as
saying ``the Middle East connection seems most likely.''
   Investigators said Thursday's blast destroyed the inside of the
club and wrecked other parked cars. The bomb apparently was hidden
in a Fiat 127 auto that was ripped apart by the explosion.
   The USO club is just off Piazza Municipio, about 200 yards from
the Naples waterfront.
   Italian media noted the blast occurred almost exactly two years
after U.S. warplanes attacked Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation
for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in
West Berlin that killed an American soldier.
   A USO club in Barcelona, Spain, was attacked Dec. 6 by an
attacker with hand grenades who shouted ``Long live Lebanon.'' The
blasts killed U.S. Navy Petty Officer Ronald C. Strong and injured
nine other people.
   The Navy has a major presence in Naples, the headquarters for
NATO's southern command and the support center for the 6th Fleet.
   About 45 ships, 200 aircraft and more than 23,000 people make up
the fleet, which is deployed in the Mediterranean.
   Most 6th Fleet ships come from ports on the U.S. East Coast to
spend six months in the Mediterranean. A small number have home
ports in Naples and La Maddalena, Sardinia, according to the Navy.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the U.S.-supported Contra
rebels and the leftist Sandinista government said Thursday they had
reached a compromise that would allow cease-fire talks to go ahead.
   The agreement to start high-level negotiations in the Nicaraguan
capital Friday came during the first official visit of Contra
representatives to the capital since the war started more than six
years ago.
   The two sides also resumed stalled talks on technical details of
a temporary cease-fire, such as how to provide the rebels with
humanitarian aid and security.
   Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacaso, chief of staff of the
Sandinista army and head of the government's delegation to the
technical talks, said before the meeting he was confident the two
sides would ``finish discussing the plan'' for implementing the
temporary cease-fire.
   Contra political representatives at the meeting included
Aristides Sanchez, Roberto Ferrey, Bosco Matamoros and Alejandro
Montiel Arguello. The rebels' military delegation included Jose
Benito Bravo Centeno and Juan Rivas.
   In a compromise, the Sandinistas backed off demands that the
technical talks be held in Managua.
   In exchange, the Contras retreated from their earlier insistence
that Friday's high-level negotiations be conditioned on the
successful outcome of the Sapoa talks.
   ``The Contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today
(Thursday), they'll conclude in Managua,'' government Information
Minister Manuel Espinoza said in a telephone interview.
   Two Contra delegates, Ferrey and David Stadthagen, arrived from
Costa Rica in a private plane in the morning to negotiate the
compromise. They were met at Managua's Sandino airport by Tourism
Minister Herty Lewites.
   It was the first time since the war began that the Sandinistas
allowed Contra representatives to set foot in the capital.
   In a brief talk with reporters later, Ferrey confirmed
Espinoza's announcement that a compromise was reached.
   In the technical talks, military representatives from both sides
are seeking agreement on how to implement a provisional cease-fire
accord they signed at Sapoa on March 23.
   The 60-day cease-fire began April 1 even though many issues were
still to be resolved.
   So far both sides have agreed to seven cease-fire zones where
the rebels will gather.
   Two points in the Contra proposal were termed ``non negotiable''
by the Sandinistas. The Contra proposal would allow the combatants
to receive arms and amunition while in the zones and bar the
government from accepting military aid, which comes from the Soviet
bloc.
   According to the March 23 cease-fire accord, the Sandinistas
would permit the rebels to receive humanitarian aid, allow them to
participate in a national reconciliation dialogue and release 700
political prisoners.
   Contra leaders also insisted on freedom of movement to meet with
opposition leaders inside Nicaragua, which the Sandinistas at first
refused. The government later said the rebels would be permitted to
meet with Roman Catholic Church leaders and visit La Prensa, the
country's only opposition newspaper.
   The cease-fire talks are within the framework of a regional
peace initiative signed by the presidents of five Central American
countries including Nicaragua.

   A suspected member of Japan's terrorist
Red Army charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turned
over Thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what he
planned to do with the explosives.
   The 35-year-old suspect, who was identified by officials in his
native Japan through fingerprints as Yu Kikumura, is listed by the
Japanese Foreign Ministry as a suspected member of the left-wing
Red Army.
   U.S. officials said they had not yet established ties between
Kikumura and any group.
   ``We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to
answer,'' said John C. McGinley, agent in charge of the FBI office
in Newark.
   Kikumura was arrested Tuesday at a New Jersey Turnpike service
area in Ridgefield after a state trooper found three bombs in his
car, officials said.
   Superior Court Judge Charles DeGisi released Kikimura to federal
agents without setting bail Thursday. Kikimura was taken to a New
York City jail to be held for a hearing Friday before a U.S.
magistrate in Newark.
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court by the FBI,
authorities charged Kikumura with possessing a fraudulent visa and
unregistered firearms. If convicted, he faces up to $260,000 in
fines and up to 15 years in prison.
   State and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said
Thursday they have little information about Kikumura and what he
planned to do with the bombs.
   McGinley said Kikimura had not spoken to federal officials since
being taken into custody.
   According to Japanese authorities, Kikumura was acquitted in a
Japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his
luggage at an airport in the Netherlands, which deported him.
   The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Kikumura's arrest
Tuesday had raised suspicions the Red Army might be planning
attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations
June 19 in Toronto, Canada.
   The Red Army, which advocates ``simultaneous world revolution''
and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups
in Lebanon, has been linked to a bloody attack on Tel Aviv's Lod
Airport in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a Japan
Air Lines plane in 1977.
   The group has been largely inactive in the 1980s, but South
Korean officials have expressed concern it might revive its
terrorist activities at the Olympics in September.
   State police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said the
terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the
sophisticated nature of the bombs.
   ``These are the first devices of this type that we have come
across,'' Pagano said. Neither federal or state officials would
elaborate.
   According to the federal complaint, police said the bombs
consisted of three 18-inch steel cylinders. There was a total of 15
pounds of black powder in the car, officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said authorities have learned
Kikumura acquired an international driver's license in the name of
Masatoshi Kishizona on Jan. 20.
   Kishizono is a 36-year-old employee of a hospital in Kyoto,
Japan, who had reported his passport missing, police said.
   On Feb. 29, Kikumura, using a fraudulent passport bearing
Kishizona's name, applied for a visa to the United States at the
U.S. Embassy in Paris, Alito said. He said Kikumura entered the
United States on March 8.

<HEAD>UN Chief Proposes New Iran-Iraq Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary-general considers the
positions of Iran and Iraq too far apart for a cease-fire to work
and has proposed a new peace plan under which he would control the
timing of a truce and other factors.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed his views in a written report
submitted to the Security Council on Wednesday after meeting with
envoys of both nations. A copy of the confidential 15-page report
was made available to The Associated Press on Thursday by sources
close to the proceedings.
   The secretary-general has held four rounds of meetings in New
York with the combatants, at the council's request, in an effort to
get their clear support for a resolution adopted last July. It
demands an immediate cease-fire in the 7{-year-old war and
withdrawal of troops.
   Perez de Cuellar concluded the talks this week and said in his
report: ``I considered the positions of the two governments ... to
be insufficient for purposes of implementing Resolution 598,'' then
asked them to reply to a new proposal. He said he was awaiting
their responses.
   His latest plan, a modification of others, gives the
secretary-general authority to control the timing and intervals for
implementing the resolution.
   It says the secretary-general would set a date for implementing
the plan, and on that day a cease-fire would commence and an
impartial body would begin investigating which side started the war.
   After an interval of several days, to be determined by the
secretary-general, Iran and Iraq would begin withdrawing their
forces. After another interval, also set by Perez de Cuellar, other
elements of the resolution would be carried out and both sides
would announce their intention to repatriate all prisoners of war.
   Perez de Cuellar has not commented publicly on the talks, but
diplomats say U.N. peace efforts are stalled because of
intransigence by Iran and, to a lesser degree, Iraq.
   Iraq has said it accepts the resolution if Iran does so
explicitly. The Iranians have said only that they endorse an
outline given by the secretary-general for implementation, not the
resolution itself.
   Iran insists Iraq be declared the aggressor before a cease-fire
takes effect. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes.
   The United States is urging the council to impose an arms
embargo on Iran to force its compliance with the resolution. An
embargo resolution is being drafted but the Soviet Union wants to
allow more time for diplomacy.
   In his report, Perez de Cuellar said he emphasized to both sides
that a cease-fire must be ``an irreversible step towards the
overall solution,'' not a recess used to rearm.
   Iraq has expressed concern that without a permanent cease-fire
and immediate troop withdrawal, Iran would use a lull to rearm,
repair its damaged oil refineries and prepare for renewed warfare.

   Shiite Moslem hijackers freed another
hostage from a Kuwaiti jumbo jet Thursday but said they will not
retract their demands ``even if the price we have to pay is very
high.''
   The release of the elderly, grizzled man came after the
hijackers resumed talks with Algerian mediators on ending the
10-day-old crisis.
   The man, dressed in a white robe, descended from the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747 at 9:45 p.m. (3:45 EDT), got into a car and was
driven across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at Houari Boumedienne
Airport.
   Algerian officials said he was a Kuwaiti named Djuma Abdallah
Chatti.
   ``Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time
and I am tired,'' said Chatti, who gave his age as 70.
   ``They are not good people,'' he told reporters in the airport
lounge. ``They beat me.''
   At least 30 hostages remained on board the plane seized April 5
on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight.
   The hijackers first diverted the plane to northern Iran. It flew
three days later to Larnaca, Cyprus, where Palestine Liberation
Organization officials negotiated with the hijackers. The gunmen
have killed two passengers and freed 71. Among the remaining
hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family.
   After the latest release, the hijackers broadcast a message to
the control tower in Arabic and English, repeating their demand for
the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in Kuwait.
   The statement said Chatti had been released for ``strictly
humanitarian reasons.''
   ``We repeat forcefully our demands for the liberation of our 17
brothers in Kuwait, and we will not go back on them even if the
price we have to pay is very high,'' the statement said.
   Kuwait's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Al-Osaimi, reiterated
that the 17 would not be freed. He is head of a high-level Kuwaiti
delegation on the scene.
   Another Kuwaiti official, speaking to reporters on condition he
not be identified, said the Algerian authorities continued to put
pressure on Kuwait to be more flexible in its position.
   ``You can see this from the fact that they are telling us that
the ball is in our court,'' the official said.
   Negotiations between the hijackers and Algerian mediators
resumed Thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day
caused by the lack of progress, according to the official Algerian
news agency.
   In Washington, lawmakers urged Secretary of State George P.
Shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers
might be responsible for kidnapping American journalist Terry
Anderson in Lebanon.
   Kuwait's independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that
the alleged kidnapper, Imad Mughniyeh, was believed to have boarded
the plane when it landed in Mashhad, Iran.
   Mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs in
Beirut for Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be the
umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat accused Iran of being behind the
hijacking and said some of the gunmen ``belong to the Iranian
government.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid echoed
Arafat's comments Thursday in Cairo.
   In a radio call to the airport tower Thursday, a passenger who
identified himself as Ahmed Zayed said: ``I ask my government to
release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us
all.''
   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, is the group that holds Anderson,
and it also is demanding the release of the 17 Kuwaiti prisoners.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held longer than any of
the 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The hijackers, said to be armed with grenades and guns, have
threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages
if their demands are not met.
   A ranking Algerian official said Wednesday that Kuwait's
``intransigence'' had created the standstill.
   Algeria's negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by
Interior Minister Hedi Khediri. One team is responsible for
contacts with the Kuwaitis, and the other with the hijackers.
   A doctor was allowed on board the plane Thursday to examine the
hostages.
   ``I saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or
major medicine,'' said Dr. Youssef Mahdi. He later told the
official Algerian news agency that he prescribed some ``routine
medicines'' that would be sent to the plane.
   ``The passengers I saw did not have their hands tied and
displayed no signs of physical violence,'' Mahdi said.
   An airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food,
the Algerian official said.
   In a letter Wednesday to Shultz, Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep.
Louise Slaughter, both New York Democrats, wrote: ``We know the
United States is not a primary party to the Algiers negotiations.
But if Terry Anderson's chief kidnapper is on the Kuwaiti jet, the
United States government must ensure that the negotiators are aware
of this fact.''
   ``It would be a travesty for Imad Mughniyeh to go free while
Terry Anderson remains a captive,'' they said.
   The plane landed in Algeria on Tuesday night.
   It was moved early Thursday to the end of the runway so another
jet could land. It was later returned to its original position
about 400 yards from the terminal.

   Indiana's Supreme Court decided Thursday
that the case of a young woman who underwent an abortion in
defiance of a court order will be heard by a lower court first
because there's no longer any urgency.
   The 18-year-old woman, meanwhile, refused to discuss the matter.
   ``She would just like to disappear,'' said Samuel E. Beecher
Jr., attorney for the unmarried Terre Haute woman identified in
court documents only as V.J.H. ``She's a very private person. She
never imagined that she would have had this publicity.''
   The woman's attorneys announced Wednesday that she had undergone
an abortion despite a Vigo Circuit Court order prohibiting her from
terminating her pregnancy. The order was issued Monday at the
request of a 24-year-old Terre Haute truck driver who claimed to be
the father.
   After the court order was issued, attorneys for both sides had
asked for an expedited appeal to the state Supreme Court. On
Thursday, the justices rejected that request.
   ``You have to have two things _ a question of great public
importance and an emergency situation,'' said court administrator
Karl Mulvaney. ``The court's feeling is that clearly there is no
emergency any more.''
   The case will be heard first by a three-judge panel of the state
Court of Appeals. The case has not been assigned yet, Mulvaney said.
   Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of the
man and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman's
attorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father.
   Richard A. Waples, legal director of the Indiana Civil Liberties
Union, argued that previous U.S. Supreme Court decisions give the
mother sole authority to terminate a pregnancy during the first
three months.
   But Waples said he wanted the injunction issued by Vigo Circuit
Judge Robert H. Brown overturned because ``if this order is allowed
to go uncorrected, other judges might be tempted to do the same.''
   James Bopp Jr., attorney for the national Right to Life
organization and for the Terre Haute man, said he wants a higher
court ruling on whether a father's rights should be weighed against
the mother's in such cases.
   Bobb said in court papers that his client was upset about the
abortion and thought the mother terminated the pregnancy for
frivolous reasons.
   Waples said that he has found at least three cases where the
mother's right to go ahead and have an abortion despite a court
order was ultimately upheld.
   Bopp said he isn't interested in punishing the woman, and
Beecher said Brown has indicated he wouldn't seek a contempt
citation, which could carry penalties of a $500 fine and 90 days in
jail.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Vote To End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Leaders of two actors' unions voted
resoundingly to end a strike that virtually halted production of
new radio and TV commercials for more than three weeks, officials
announced Thursday.
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists boards voted 123 to 29 to approve a
tentative three-year contract, said SAG spokesman Mark Locher.
   The vote Tuesday and Wednesday must be ratified by the 100,000
members of the two unions, but the strike is being suspended as of
Friday morning, Locher said.
   The unions will mail contract terms and ballots to members next
week recommending approval of the contract, he said. The final
votes are due back May 20.
   ``We feel that we achieved the most important principal behind
the strike and that was establishing payment for the cable use of
commercials which used to be free,'' Locher said.
   Other terms of the contract, Locher said, include a 10 percent
increase in minimum session fees, raising payments from $333 to
$366 for an eight-hour workday; a 13.5 percent increase in radio
commercial rates for AFTRA members; and an increase in
contributions by producers to performers' health and pension plans.
   Bob Stephens, vice president of the western office of the
American Association of Advertising Agencies, said Thursday
afternoon that he had not yet been notified of the settlement.
   ``I'm sure the (advertising) agency community will be
thrilled,'' Stephens said.
   A call seeking comment from the association's New York
headquarters went unanswered Thursday evening.
   The strike, which began March 21, virtually halted production of
new commercials, but ads continued to be broadcast because typical
contracts between advertisers and actors allow use of the product
for up to 21 months.
   Commercial work accounted for payments of $417 million to actors
in 1987, about half the total paid for acting of all kinds.

<HEAD>Jackson Denounces Racial Litmus Tests: Dukakis on Top in New Poll</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: TOPS with 13 grafs to update with New York debate; picks up
4th graf pvs, ``Jesse, Jesse...; edits to tighten.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. on Thursday renewed his attack on
Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis for his statement
about use of nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of
Europe. Dukakis told Gore: ``Give me a buzz and I'll tell you
exactly what I said.''
   Gore, Dukakis and Jesse Jackson met in a one-hour debate in New
York City that served more to highlight their similarities than
their differences.
   Except for the exchanges between Gore and Dukakis on nuclear
weapons, the forum, sponsored by WCBS and Newsday was a low-key,
gentlemanly encounter in which the candidates appeared determined
to avoid the sharp clashes that have marked the New York primary
campaign.
   Earlier in the day, Jackson denounced ``litmus tests of race and
religion ... spouted from the mouths of public officials'' as one
official, New York Mayor Edward Koch, endorsed Gore.
   Meanwhile, polls put Dukakis on top, with Jackson trailing and
Gore at the bottom in the battle for survival in Tuesday's New York
primary.
   During the debate, Gore was asked if there were any
circumstances under which he would consider using nuclear weapons.
The Tennessee senator used the occasion to renew his criticism of
Dukakis for saying in a newspaper interview that he would reserve
his option to use nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion
of Europe.
   ``This is a serious mistake'' said Gore, referring to the
Dukakis statement. ``It has never been done'' by presidents or
presidential candidates.
   ``Was that an answer to your question?'' Dukakis asked the
moderator.
   Jackson said there was ``a real danger in those of us who may
very well lead our country to get trapped into a hypothetical
situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy the whole
world to prove that you got macho.''
   When Gore raised the issue again later in the debate, Dukakis
said: ``Don't pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press
conference. Give me a buzz and I'll tell you exactly what I said
and there'll be much less confusion.''
   Even on Middle East policy, which has produced sharp differences
during the New York campaign, the candidates concentrated on their
areas of agreement.
   Meanwhile, Republican nominee-to-be George Bush, keeping to a
low-key campaign schedule, ran into a wave of enthusiasm for
Jackson among Washington toddlers.
   ``Jesse Jackson, Jesse Jackson, Jesse Jackson'' the children
chanted after a reporter shouted a question to Bush about Jackson
during the vice president's visit to a Labor Department day care
center.
   With the focus on the New York primary, Koch stepped into the
spotlight Thursday afternoon to announce his endorsement of Gore as
``a man of intellect, courage and integrity.'' He said, ``Gore is
head and shoulders above his rivals'' on Israeli issues.
   Dukakis reacted mildly to the endorsment, saying in Boston, ``He
likes us both.'' And Jackson said, ``What he has done by choosing
someone is positve and fair and proper.''
   But Jackson's tone was quite different when he lashed out at
Koch, President Reagan and former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro for what he called ``race-based
questions.''
   ``We went across the South on Super Tuesday without a single
cat-call or boo, without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting,''
Jackson told the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
Washington. ``It was not until we got north to New York that the
litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of
public officials without a significant media challenge.''
   ``There are those who are making race-based statments
unfortunately _ whether Mr. Reagan or Mr. Koch or Ms. Ferraro,''
Jackson said to reporters. ``I simply say some people are making
hysteria while I'm making history.''
   Koch said recently that Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jackson because of his positions on Israel.
   Reagan told the editors on Wednesday that Jackson has been
spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be
interpreted as ``some kind of racial attack.''
   In a Wednesday night speech, Ms. Ferraro lauded Jackson but
added that if he ``were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.''
She said he can't win the nomination nor the general election.
   The news from the New York polls was good for Dukakis and
improving for Jackson but bad for Gore.
   Dukakis led Jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a CBS News
poll, 46 percent to 34 percent in a Marist College poll and 49
percent to 34 percent in an ABC News-Washington Post poll. Gore had
only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third.
   Among likely Democratic primary voters, surveyed Monday and
Tuesday by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, Dukakis
had the support of 46 percent, Jackson 34 percent, Gore 7 percent
and ``uncommitted'' 5 percent. Eight percent of those polled were
undecided. The poll of 359 people had a potential sampling error of
5 percentage points either way.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis picked up the support of at least 54 of
Puerto Rico's delegates to the Democratic National Convention in
July. That gave Dukakis a gain of 74 delegates in the past seven
days as he continued to pick up strength among the party's
unpledged ``super delegates.''
   The latest AP delegate count gave Dukakis 816.15 to 715.1 for
Jackson. Gore trailed with 404.55, while uncommitted delegates
totaled 474.75. Sen Paul Simon of Illinois, whose campaign is on
hold, had 173.5.

   Thirty-two passengers remained trapped
inside a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet for the 10th day today, and
Algerian mediators said attempts to negotiate an end to the ordeal
had reached a stalemate.
   Negotiations were suspended after mediators were unable to
persuade Kuwaiti officials to meet the hijackers' demands, a
ranking Algerian official said. Talks with the hijackers were
called off at 11:45 p.m. Wednesday (6:45 p.m. EDT) to give
negotiators time to rest, and there was no sign of a breakthrough.
   The hijackers, thought to number about eight, are armed with
grenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane and kill
their hostages.

estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from Afghanistan.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze also plan to issue statements

   President Reagan insists that he was never
aware his spokesman concocted quotes for him and says he is getting
tired of ``kiss-and-tell books'' written by his former aides.
   Reagan, answering questions at a meeting of the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, also said Jesse Jackson's policies have not
been scrutinized adequately in the Democratic presidential race
because it might be ``misinterpreted into some kind of racial
attack.''
   In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session on Wednesday, the
president commented for the first time on two issues _ the
sensitive topic of race in the 1988 presidential race and the
controversy over the new book by his former spokesman, Larry
Speakes.
   Speakes, in his book ``Speaking Out,'' reveals that he twice
gave quotes to the press corps claiming the words were Reagan's

   Democratic party leaders and politicians whose
support as ``super delegates'' could prove crucial in winning the
presidential nomination are giving Michael Dukakis most of the
49-delegate lead he holds over rival Jesse Jackson.
   Were it not for the support of these delegates, who are going to
the Democratic National Convention because of offices they
currently or formerly held, Dukakis would be ahead of Jackson by
fewer than seven delegate votes, according to a survey by The
Associated Press.
   Dukakis has 764.15 delegates overall including 72.5 votes from
super delegates. He has gained 24 of those super delegates over the
last month, including nine members of the Senate nominated this
week to attend the party's convention.
   By comparison, Jackson is supported by none of the 32 senators
nominated this week. He has 715.1 delegates overall, including 30.1
super delegates, a gain of 11 over the last month.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks plummeted 101

   The dollar plunged on world currency markets
Thursday in reaction to bad news on the U.S. trade deficit despite
a massive coordinated effort on the part of the United States and
its economic allies to halt the slide.
   The dollar's steep dive served served as an ominous reminder to

   Just as it had done several times last year, the weakness in the

   The ``average'' American will have to work 126

   The best taxpayers have fared in the past decade was in 1984 _
when most of the big 1981 federal income-tax reduction had taken
effect _ when Tax Freedom Day fell on April 28, economists for the
foundation said.
   But federal tax increases enacted in 1982, 1984 and 1987 ``have
lopped off big chunks of the '81 cuts, and Social Security hikes
have made further inroads until, like the Cheshire Cat in `Alice in

<HEAD>Township's `First Couple' Remains in Community's Waning Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WALPACK TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late afternoon sun casts long
shadows over the clapboard houses that line Main Street in Walpack
Center. It's dead still, but that's not unusual.
   Walpack Township is dying.
   And Walpack Center, the once-thriving hub of the community, is
nearly a ghost town, having faded year by year since the federal
government bought up the surrounding countryside to build a dam _
and then changed its mind.
   ``There seems to be no trace of what was here, like it never
happened,'' Township Clerk Virginia E. Fuller said, as she and her
husband, Mayor Raymond Fuller, settled into chairs on the
glass-enclosed front porch of their home outside Walpack Center.
   ``It was an active community,'' she recalled. ``We had a fire
department and a ladies auxilliary. We used to take the bus to the
city every now and then.
   ``It's like it was all erased,'' she added.
   ``Suits me fine,'' her husband said, trying to appear
cantankerous but breaking into booming laughter.
   Only the municipal building _ an old one-room schoolhouse _ and
the rescue squad garage are still owned by the township.
   The federal government owns the former Methodist church, which
is now locked, along with six houses and a post office that make up
the rest of Walpack Center.
   The houses all are painted the same beige with green trim,
lending an eerie quality to the silence. The post office is open
only two hours, six days a week.
   Spreading from the township center are acres of what once was
pasture. But the farmhouses, the fences and barns are long gone.
   The death knell for Walpack sounded in 1962 when Congress
authorized a plan to build a dam at Tocks Island, a few miles north
up the Delaware River. The idea was to create a 12,000-acre lake
along 37 miles of the Delaware River from Port Jervis, N.Y., to the
Delaware Water Gap.
   The federal government spent $9 million on engineering for the
proposed dam between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. An additional
$75.2 million bought land for the lake and a surrounding park. The
lake was to be used for recreation and water supply, while the dam
would provide hydroelectric power and flood control.
   But Congress never appropriated money to build the dam because
of environmental and economic objections.
   In 1978, it turned the project over from the Army Corps of
Engineers to the National Park Service, which is turning the land
and river into the 69,000-acre Delaware Water Gap National
Recreation Area.
   The federal government now owns all but about 5,000 acres of the
land it intends to incorporate into the park. That land, in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, is still privately owned.
   The Fullers, whose home is on a half-acre plot, are among about
90 residents left in Walpack Township, a 45-square-mile community
that falls entirely within the recreation area.
   The Fullers, both 62, say they intend to stay in Walpack, and
serve as mayor and clerk, as long as they are able. They won't sell
out to the government, as their neighbors did.
   ``People think we're crazy for staying, but it's great,'' Mrs.
Fuller said, gazing across a deep ravine to the pines on a far
ridge.
   The government's objective for the area is to ``provide
opportunities for outdoor recreation,'' said Richard Ring, the park
service's assistant superintendent of the area.
   ``Probably got just as much use before,'' Mrs. Fuller said.
   ``More,'' said her husband.
   But Ring says 2.5 million people visit the recreation area
annually to hunt, fish, swim, ride bikes, hike and go boating and
canoeing on the river. Officials expect the number to double in the
next decade, he said.
   To accommodate the visitors, the park service plans to set up
restrooms, picnic areas, refreshment stands, boat landings and
trails for hiking and biking.
   ``There also are a number of historic facilities that folks can
come and tour,'' Ring said.
   Among those historic facilities are homes once owned by people
like the Fullers. The buildings in Walpack Center may eventually
house country inns, craft shops, art galleries, museums,
restaurants or ``other facilities consistent with the
(government's) objectives for the area,'' Ring said.
   Thousands of other houses, that were deemed to have no historic
or cultural value, were torn down.
   ``We fought it like the devil,'' Fuller said of opposition to
the federal plans.
   Walpack, established in the 1750s, had a year-round population
of about 375 in the early 1960s, with numbers swelling to about
3,000 in the summer, the Fullers said. Most residents were dairy
farmers and most summer people came for the fishing and hunting, or
the solitude.
   ``Sometimes it's hard to remember what it was like,'' Mrs.
Fuller said.

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Chairman Faces Revolt on Home Front</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are the best of times and the
worst of times for Willie L. Brown Jr., the flamboyant speaker of
the California Assembly and national chairman of Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign.
   They are heady times for Brown as the Jackson campaign continues
to exceed expectations and Jackson emerges as a serious contender
for the Democratic nomination for president.
   They are also tough times for Brown as he is under siege as
never before on his home turf, in the halls of the state Capitol,
where his 7{-year rule of the Assembly is in danger.
   Brown voices quiet confidence in both arenas. In the Jackson
campaign, he modestly understates his current role or potential
influence at the Democratic National Convention. In California
political circles, his public calm conceals a desperate battle to
hold his powerful office.
   Brown's appointment as Jackson's national chairman last November
was widely reported as a major boost to Jackson's campaign.
   As the black leader of a predominately white legislative body
and as a pre-eminent fund-raiser for California Democrats, Brown
was seen as someone possessing the political skills, prestige,
experience and contacts Jackson needed most to broaden his
constituency among white political leaders and voters.
   That's exactly what has happened to the Jackson campaign. And
while Brown publicly gives all of the credit to Jackson, his
influence in the campaign appears strong, and Brown is increasingly
being viewed as a key player in picking the next Democratic nominee
if the convention becomes deadlocked.
   Brown, who originally backed New York Gov. Mario Cuomo for the
1988 nomination, acknowledges that he was initially attracted to
the Jackson campaign as a vehicle to ``get in the room'' of major
players who would pick the Democratic nominee if the convention
deadlocked.
   ``I need to get a horse with 1,000 chits (delegates) to get in
the room. Jesse looks like my best agent,'' the Washington Post
quoted Brown as saying a year ago.
   Brown confirmed that quote earlier this month, but said ``I'm
beyond that now,'' and that his goal is ``trying to secure the
nomination for Mr. Jackson.''
   ``I've been there once, (in the inner circle picking a
presidential nominee) and I'm going to be back,'' Brown said,
referring to 1972, when he co-chaired the California delegation
which was key to winning the nomination for George McGovern.
   Brown claims to have raised $1 million for Jackson, a good chunk
of the candidate's overall treasury. And he talks regularly by
telephone to Jackson, a compulsive caller.
   But while Brown's potential influence on national politics is
greater than ever before, his political base is Sacramento is
crumbling.
   The 54-year-old Brown, who was raised in a one-room house in
racially segregated Mineola, Tex., hitchhiked to San Francisco
after high school and worked as a janitor while living with an
uncle and attending college and law school.
   He started a storefront law practice in 1959 which, by his own
description, was primarily ``pimps and prostitutes,'' and became
active in civil rights demonstrations. Within five years, Brown,
then 30, had won a seat in the state Assembly.
   By 1971, Brown was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a
powerful fiscal post which paradoxically made Brown nominally the
legislative author of then-Gov. Ronald Reagan's state budgets.
   Then, in a 1980 coalition with the Republican minority, Brown
defeated two other Democrats to become Assembly speaker, an office
which the late Jesse Unruh had transformed a decade earlier from a
ceremonial presiding officer's job into a fund-raising and
policy-making post second in influence only to the governor.
   The speaker's office, replete with both the subtle and overt
trappings of power, fit Brown like a glove.
   His wit and flamboyant style made him an instant success as a
fund-raiser, helping him raise up to $5 million annually for other
Democrats, thereby cementing his hold on the office and freeing him
from dependence on a coalition with Republicans.
   Being speaker, Brown said, was like being ``the Ayatollah of
California,'' with power to set the legislative agenda and assign
or remove colleagues from legislative committees.
   It also gave him an office in the Capitol he describes as
``bigger than my home town,'' which matched nicely the taste for
lavish parties, $1,000 suits and $100,000 sports cars which Brown
acquired as his private law practice has evolved from criminal to
corporate.
   But as the Democratic majority in the 80-seat Assembly has
slipped under Brown from 47 to the current 44 seats, complaints
grew that his flamboyance and sometimes embarrassing remarks were
hurting Democrats more than his fund-raising was helping them.
   This came to a head earlier this year when five conservative
Assembly Democrats, motivated by a variety of relatively obscure
personal disagreements with Brown, bolted his leadership. Without
their support, Brown retains the title and outward trappings of the
speakership, but without a working majority.
   The five have aligned themselves with Republicans to push
anti-abortion, death penalty and wiretap bills which Brown
previously bottled up in committee, and they have even defeated
routine legislative housekeeping rules backed by Brown.
   Brown at first punished the five, stripping them of most
legislative duties and banishing them to smaller Capitol offices.
More recently, he has ignored or downplayed the defeats, contending
it never was his intent to dictate policy.
   The five dissident Democrats, who hold the balance of power in
the Assembly, say they have no intention now of trying to oust
Brown.
   ``Why should we? We are controlling the policy agenda,'' says
one of the five, Democrat Rusty Areias.
   That means Brown can probably continue to occupy the speaker's
office until the current Assembly session adjourns Aug. 31.
   Brown says he will re-elected speaker next year. But unless he
wins back the five dissident Democrats, his hopes for another term
as speaker depend on either winning at least two more Democratic
seats this year to create a majority not dependent on the five
rebels or forging another coalition with Republicans.
   As Sacramento-based political columnist Dan Walters puts it,
``There is a growing sense in the Capitol that Brown's days as
speaker are numbered. But no one has figured out the number yet.''

<HEAD>Business Leaders' Confidence Rises In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Confidence among top business executives in the
U.S. economy following October's stock market crash has rebounded,
according to the Conference Board.
   During the first quarter, the business research group's measure
of business confidence ticked up to 51 after falling to a five-year
low of 47 in the final quarter of 1987, the group said Wednesday.
The measure reflects a scale of 0 to 100.
   More than a third of the 1,000 executives polled said they
expect to have greater problems finding qualified employees this
year than in the previous year. The Conference Board said nearly 20
percent of the executives polled expect employment in their
industries to rise this year, but 29 percent expect job losses.
   Business services and the instruments and primary metals
industries hold the brightest employment prospects, while banking,
gas and electric utilities and the insurance industry are likely to
be hit with job losses, the board reported.
   ``The moderate rise in business executives' confidence parallels
an upturn in consumer confidence during the first quarter,'' said
Conference Board economist Steven Malin.
   ``A strong irony in the latest survey is that all of the
increased optimism revolves around likely business conditions later
this year, not now,'' he added.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange reached
new highs again on Thursday morning, while the U.S. dollar rose
marginally against the Japanese yen in early foreign exchange
activity.
   The bellwether Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
climbed for the fourth consecutive day, adding another 67.52 points
to Wednesday's record close to finish the morning session at
27,053.07.
   It was the first time the Nikkei average ever topped 27,000,
surpassing its previous intraday high of 26,988.36 points hit in
early trading on Monday. The Nikkei index has come within five
points of the 27,000 mark in intraday trading three times this
week, but slipped back each time amid the continuing market rally.
   In currency trading, the dollar opened at 126.20 yen, down 0.25
yen from Wednesday's finish, but later edged higher and was
changing hands at 126.35 yen by late morning.
   Fumihiko Morimoto of the investment firm First Boston said the
market was supported by continued strength on Wall Street and
somewhat by the agreement among the seven top industrialized
nations to continue cooperating to keep the dollar from falling
further.
   In a two-page joint communique after a meeting Wednesday in
Washington, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the
seven nations announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in
which they pledged to stabilize the U.S. currency.
   The so-called Group of Seven nations are the United States,
Japan, France, Britain, Canada, Italy and Germany.
   A dealer at a major U.S investment firm, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the foreign exchange market likely would be
affected more by the release Thursday of U.S. trade figures for
February.
   The U.S. trade deficit has affected the dollar's direction in
recent months because the U.S. administration has supported a lower
dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.

   The flying public, already wary of
financially-troubled Texas Air Corp., could be driven further away
by the government's unprecedented special investigation of the
nation's biggest airline company, observers say.
   The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it would
investigate whether Texas Air and its management were ``fit,
willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic.
   The government has investigated small airlines and has revoked
the operating licenses of some minor carriers, but analysts say the
DOT's new inquiry is the first involving major U.S. airlines.
   Houston-based Texas Air, an industry giant with a commanding 20
percent of all U.S. air traffic, is the parent company of Eastern
Airlines and Continental Airlines.
   The federal probe, added to the company's financial and labor
headaches, could drive still more passengers away as Texas Air's
tarnished image deteriorates further.
   ``It's quite serious,'' said James V. Cammisa, publisher of
Travel Industry Indicators, an industry newsletter. ``Both (Eastern
and Continental) are suffering from image problems now, anyway.''
   Texas Air stock dropped more than $1 a share, to $10.75, on the
American Stock Exchange when news of the DOT investigation hit the
market. The stock closed at $10.87{, down 87{ cents from Tuesday.
   In a separate action on Wednesday, the Federal Aviation
Administration announced a civil penalty of $823,000 against
Miami-based Eastern because of ``recurring trends'' of violations
of safety regulations. The fine was imposed just over a year after
Eastern agreed to pay a $9.5 million penalty in connection with
other safety violations.
   The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in
September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to
challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the FAA considers
valid, the fine could be reduced.
   ``No airline likes to raise the specter of safety at all,'' said
Anthony Hatch, an industry analyst for Argus Research Corp. He said
it's difficult to estimate how many people would not fly the
airline as a result of the negative publicity surrounding the
federal probe.
   Texas Air and its aggressive chairman, Frank Lorenzo, have been
locking horns with unions at Eastern over proposed pay cuts and
other labor issues. Lorenzo put Houston-based Continental into
bankruptcy in 1983 and emerged with a non-union airline.
   The Texas Air carriers have a debt of around $5.4 billion, but
Lorenzo has set up a corporate structure that insulates the parent
company from most of the burden. The company sustained record
losses of $466 million last year.
   His hard-nosed tactics, including stringent cost-cutting and
periodically triggering fare wars, have caused bitter conflicts
with the company's unions and in other quarters. More than 150
congressmen recently supported a resolution in favor of a probe of
Texas Air.
   If the DOT determines Texas Air is unfit to carry traffic, the
agency could revoke its operating license, suggested Dr. Alfred
Kahn, the architect of deregulation of the U.S. airline industry in
1978.
   But Kahn and others noted the DOT doesn't have legal authority
to force out Lorenzo and other managers approved by the company's
shareholders.
   ``We ought to be damned careful that this is an honest inquiry,
not a political one,'' said Kahn, now a professor of political
economy at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.

   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said
today the federal investigation of Texas Air Corp. and its
subsidiary Eastern Airlines should be considered a ``shot across
the bow'' of any airline that might compromise safety due to
financial pressures.
   Meanwhile, an Eastern official blamed the investigation
announced Wednesday on pressure from unions.
   Burnley also said that air travelers should be greatly reassured
by a planned month-long safety probe of Eastern's fleet, saying it
could bring ``the safest 30 days in the history of that airline or
almost any airline in U.S. history.''
   Burnley, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said he would
not hesitate to fly Eastern despite the investigation and a
proposed $823,000 fine he announced.
   Burnley said Federal Aviation Administration officials have not
been satisfied with Eastern's performance since it was taken over
by Texas Air 14 months ago. ``They've made a lot of progress on the
safety side, on the maintenance side, but we don't know that
they're quite where we want them to be,'' he said.
   ``We've got to be absolutely certain that no airline is building
up financial pressures that cause anybody in the company to think
that there's any reason to cut on the safety side,'' Burnley said.
``If there's any other airline in this country which is even
contemplating that strategy , I certainly hope that they take this
as a shot across the bow.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes blamed the FAA action on pressure
from unions which have raised public safety issues during
negotiations with the airlines. Bakes said on ``CBS This Morning''
that Eastern has invested $150 million more in maintenance since
the Texas Air takeover.
   ``The FAA has been under enormous political pressure because of
the union negotiations,'' he said.
   Eastern ran full-page ads in newspapers today, including The
Washington Post and The New York Times, saying it welcomed the
probe because it will show the airline is operating safely and has
been unfairly treated by federal authorities.
   ``We're confident the outcome will be a very good one,'' Bakes
said.
   Texas Air called both investigations unwarranted and blamed them
on pressure from union leaders who ``have mounted a continuing
campaign of distortion and lies'' about safety at both Eastern and
another subsidiary, Continental Airlines.
   Continental is the country's fourth largest airline, while
Eastern is the sixth largest. Together they carry nearly 20 percent
of the nation's air traffic.
   Eastern has for months been embroiled in a bitter confrontation
with its labor unions, which are resisting management's call for
significant contract concessions and which accused Texas Air of
syphoning off the most profitable parts of the airline.
   In announcing the two-pronged action against Texas Air and its
airline subsidiaries, Burnley cited evidence in recent company
filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission that both Eastern
and Continental ``are under substantial, increasing financial
pressure.''
   The department wants to determine if Texas Air and its
management are ``fit, willing and able'' to carry commercial air
traffic, Burnley said at a news conference also attended by FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor.
   McArtor said the new FAA safety review of Eastern was being
conducted because of concern about the ``continuing pattern of
fines, safety violations and apparent insensitivity of some of
Eastern's officials'' to FAA safety regulations.
   The FAA inspection would include examination of each of
Eastern's 267 aircraft over the next 30 days.
   The $823,000 civil penalty against Eastern comes 14 months after
Eastern agreed to pay $9.5 million in penalties because of earlier
safety infractions. FAA officials said the latest fine stems from
record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found
in the earlier action.
   The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation last
September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to
challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the FAA considers
valid, the fine could be reduced.
   Bakes called the latest FAA action unfair and expressed concern
that it may prompt some travelers not to fly Eastern. Last month,
passenger revenue at Eastern dropped 20 percent compared to March
1987, he said.
   Texas Air Corp. had record losses of $466 million last year and
has an overall debt of about $5.4 billion. Nevertheless, the
Houston-based company said in a statement Wednesday that it
``remains financially strong with over $850 million in cash at the
end of the first quarter.''
   But news of the federal investigation caused Texas Air stock to
drop more than $1 a share, to $10.75, on the American Stock
Exchange during trading Wednesday. The stock finally closed at
$10.87{, down 87{ cents from Tuesday.
   There has been increasing sentiment in Congress in recent months
for a closer examination of Texas Air. A resolution urging such a
probe has gained the support of more than 150 congressmen.
   Transportation Department officials said concern about Eastern
and Continental's health was heightened by recent financial filings
by Texas Air.
   ``The recent activities of the Texas Air Corp. and its carriers
_ particularly Continental and Eastern _ raise questions concerning
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety
and economic rules applicable to air carriers,'' the department
said in its order for an investigation.
   It said a number of financial transactions between Texas Air and
the two subsidiary airlines ``raise questions concerning whether
substantial funds and other resources are being diverted from the
air carrier subsidiaries.''
   The department questioned, for example:
   _ Texas Air shifting Eastern's profitable computer reservation
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note ``which
may be less than the system's fair market value.''
   _ Eastern paying ``substantial fees'' for management services,
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company.
   _ Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $16
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its
acquisition by Texas Air.
   _ Texas Air borrowing $25 million from Eastern in March 1987 in
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when Eastern was having
cash flow problems.

<HEAD>Korean Air Orders Six 747-400s, Takes Options on Four in $1.5
Billion Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Korean Air Lines has ordered six advanced-model
747-400 jumbo jets and placed options on four more planes in a deal
worth more than $1.5 billion, Boeing Co. announced.
   The airline also made public Wednesday a previously unannounced
$374 million order for a 747-300 Combi and two 747-200 freighters
to be delivered later this year.
   The package, which totals more than $1.9 million, includes spare
parts and support, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole
said.
   KAL already has three 747-400s on order for delivery beginning
in April 1989. Deliveries of the new -400 series orders will
continue into 1994.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz announced the sale in Seoul with
KAL president C.K. Cho.
   The order was a boost for Boeing after recent criticism from
three major customers.
   Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways and British Airways have
complained recently of poor workmanship in Boeing 747 and 767
jetliners. Shrontz met earlier this week in Tokyo with the
president of JAL, who wrote him last month about defects, but
details of the discussion were not released.
   Boeing executive vice president Phil Condit responded to the
criticism on Tuesday, saying the company builds safe airplanes and
that letters about quality concerns are not unusual.
   The new 747-400 features improved range, fuel economy,
aerodynamics and avionics.
   Cho said the planes were ordered because of the airline's
expected growth and need for airplanes with ``a high standard of
reliability and comfort.''
   The Boeing contracts were in line with KAL's long-term program
to organize worldwide service networks and improve its
competitiveness in the world airline market, KAL officials in Seoul
said.
   The contracts also were part of KAL's efforts to prepare for an
expected sharp increase in air travelers following a recent Seoul
government decision to ease restrictions on foreign trips by South
Koreans, the officials said.
   Test flights of the first 747-400, which rolled out of Boeing's
Everett factory in a ceremony in late January, have been delayed
because of electrical problems. On Tuesday, company officials said
they expected the plane to begin flight testing by the end of this
month and be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
before the year's end.
   Boeing said deliveries of the first four -400s, two each to
Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines, still are expected in
December.
   The jumbo jets ordered by KAL will carry up to 398 passengers in
a three-class arrangement. The airline said the new planes will be
able to carry a full passenger and cargo payload non-stop between
Seoul and New York.
   The KAL order brings 747-400 orders to 124 planes with a value
of nearly $15 billion.

   The stock market took a sharp drop today, faced
with the surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 37.30 points to
2,069.79 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers swamped gainers by more than 12 to 1 in the early tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 91 up, 1,160 down
and 203 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 32.71 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February
from $12.44 billion the month before.
   That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who
had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between
imports and exports.
   The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the
news, and U.S. credit markets also took the news badly.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about $15 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8.9 percent
range. Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as
about 8.3 percent.
   Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve might soon feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped 1~ to 114\; Ford Motor 1] to 45}; General Electric
1[ to 41}, and USX 1\ to 33.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
tumbled 2.53 to 150.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 3.58 at 302.21.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.98 to
2,107.10.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 664 up, 811 down and 495 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 185.12 million shares, against 140.40 million in the
previous session.

   The dollar plummeted in Europe today after the
U.S. government reported the American merchandise trade deficit
unexpectedly widened in February.
   Gold prices dropped during the morning session.
   The dollar fell almost two and a half cents against the British
pound, nearly three pfennigs against the West German mark and more
than two and a half Japanese yen after the trade report.
   The tumbling U.S. currency compelled several major central banks
to intervene and buy dollars to cushion the fall, traders reported.
   The merchandise trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in
February from $12.44 billion in January, the Commerce Department
reported in Washington.
   Economists had expected the deficit to narrow to between $11.2
billion $11.8 billion.
   Dealers said the dollar was not affected by Wednesday's
announcement by finance ministers and central bankers of the seven
major monetary nations that they had reaffirmed their December
commitment to stabilizing exchange rates.
   The move was widely expected and had already been discounted in
the market, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell marginally to 126.15 yen, closing 0.30 yen lower
than Wednesday. Later, in London, it was quoted at 123.75 compared
126.30 yen in the morning.
   ``The news of the (Group of Seven) meeting was nothing
substantial,'' said a dealer at a major U.S investment firm in
Tokyo.
   Here are dollar rates after the trade report was released, with
midmorning rates in parentheses and compared with late Wednesday:
1.6650 (1.6920) West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3745
(1.4010) Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6510 (5.7385) French
francs, down from 5.7295; 1.8740 (1.8972) Dutch guilders, down from
1.8950; 1,238.45 (1,254.00) Italian lire, down from 1,252.50;
1.2382 (1.2371) Canadian dollars, up from 1.23675.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8675, compared with $1.8420
earlier in the day and $1.8445 dollars late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $446.85 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's $449.25, and at midmorning today the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $447.
   Bullion dealers said trading was quiet as the market waited for
the U.S. trade figures.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the bid price for gold was $447, down
from $449.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.34 to close at a bid $449.48.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.34 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.41.

   The U.S. trade deficit widened unexpectedly in February to $13.8
billion, its biggest shortfall since October, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said the excess of imports over exports
rose $1.4 billion from January's $12.4 billion imbalance.
   The dollar fell shortly after the announcement and on Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 38 points
to about 2069, reflecting traders' disappointment with the news.
Financial markets had expected the deficit to shrink slightly.
   For the first two months of 1988, the deficit ran at an annual
rate of $157.6 billion, below the record $171.2 billion of last
year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $156.2
billion in 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products
increased by $2.3 billion in February. U.S. exports also rose, but
by a smaller $1.3 billion from January.
   In another report today, the Commerce Department said business
inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent in February, much slower than
the pace in recent months.
   The department said the gain in inventories pushed them up by
$825 million during February to a seasonally adjusted $715.9
billion.
   The gain came as total business sales were climbing 0.6 percent
to a seasonally adjusted $468.3 billion in February, reversing a
0.5 percent decline in January.
   On Wednesday, top finance ministers of seven major industrial
nations said the countries will keep working to stabilize the value
of the dollar against other major currencies.
   The finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
nations also announced they would develop a plan to use gold and
other commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures.
   Mindful of investors' continued uneasiness at any signs of
disunity, the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint
statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each
other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession.
   The statement reaffirmed a Dec. 22 agreement that had been
issued after long-distance discussions in which the seven countries
pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further
against major currencies.
   The dollar rose against most other major currencies Wednesday
although most traders stayed on the sidelines waiting for today's
trade deficit figures.
   The group meeting in Washington consists of finance ministers
and central bank leaders from the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   In their first face-to-face meeting since before the October
stock crash, the finance ministers also were critical of the newly
industrialized nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong
Kong for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances.
   In other economic news on Wednesday, the Commerce Department
said retail sales rose 0.8 percent in March and automakers said
sales of domestic cars and light trucks fell 10.8 percent in early
April compared with a year earlier.
   The drop in auto sales came after three months of unexpectedly
strong results. One analyst, David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., described it as a ``hiccup.''
   Retail sales were helped by Easter buying at department and food
stores. The Commerce Department said it was the fifth consecutive
monthly increase and the largest since December.
   On Wall Street, stock prices retreated slightly as the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 2.98 points to 2,107.10. It was the first
Dow decline after gains totaling more than 129 points in six
sessions.

<HEAD>Griffin, Trump Reach Agreement Over Resorts International</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Merv Griffin has reached
an agreement to buy Resorts International Inc. from property
developer Donald Trump, ending a much-publicized takeover battle,
the two dealmakers said today.
   Griffin, who was in New Jersey this morning to meet with state
gaming regulators, said he and Trump came to the agreement after a
day-long meeting in New York on Wednesday.
   Shareholders other than Trump would be paid $36 a share under
the plan, giving the deal an indicated value of about $206 million.
   Trump, who paid $135 a share for his stake in the company, also
is getting paid in cash, said Jack Nusbaum, the developer's
attorney. But he would not provide details of the payment to Trump
except to say his client is ``pleased he is making a profit.''
   Under terms reached between the two high-living businessmen,
Trump would acquire Resorts' troubled 1,250-room Taj Mahal hotel
and casino project under construction in Atlantic City to add to
his battery of gaming operations. He also would acquire other
unidentified assets.
   Griffin, who hosted the ``Merv Griffin Show'' for 23 years,
would control the existing Resorts Hotel and Casino in Atlantic
City and all Paradise Island operations in the Bahamas.
   The agreement ends a lengthy jousting match that observers
initially expected would see Trump emerge as the victor. Trump, who
controls Resorts through his 95 percent ownership of the company's
outstanding Class B shares, had been trying to take the company
private for $22 a share since February.
   Griffin, who began bidding for a majority stake in Resorts last
month, had been spurned repeatedly by Trump.
   In a joint statement issued in Los Angeles, Trump and Griffin
said: ``We are extremely pleased that the future of Resorts may
finally have been resolved in a manner which benefit the public
shareholders of Resorts and each of us.''
   They said they planned to meet with the Resorts board ``as soon
as possible'' to outline their agreement.
   Nusbaum called the accord ``one of those rare agreements that is
good for all parties.'' He noted that Trump's main interest in
Resorts had been for the Taj Mahal, ``which (Trump) thinks is the
crown jewel of Atlantic City.''
   Griffin said he would meet with members of the state Casino
Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement today and
expected to exchange ``a lot of pleasantries.''
   If the deal is completed, Griffin will acquire 5.7 million Class
A shares and the 40,000 Class B shares not owned by Trump. The New
York developer maintained a controlling interest in Resorts because
his Class B shares each carried 100 votes.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation of the
profit-taking that began Tuesday.
   The sell-off is not unusual considering last week's dramatic
gains, which were based largely on a pair of Agriculture Department
reports indicating potentially tight supplies of soybeans, analysts
said.
   ``It's just a technical correction,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We had a big upswing last
week, the market started going down Tuesday, it went down yesterday

   The USDA said Wednesday it had targeted India for 1.2 million
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices. Such news would be

   The world's top financial leaders today tried
to put the best face on a surprisingly large U.S. trade deficit in
an effort to calm currency markets thrown into disarray by the
unexpected dose of bad news.
   The dollar plunged immediately after the Commerce Department
reported that the imbalance between U.S. imports and exports surged
to $13.8 billion in February, the highest monthly imbalance since
the record October figure.
   The trade deficit report came one day after the world's seven
major industrial countries held high-level talks in Washington and
pledged renewed cooperation to support the value of the dollar at
current levels.
   Before today's trade report, the seven countries had been
successful for four months in their efforts to stabilize the
greenback.
   Basking in that success, the seven nations had issued a glowing
communique on Wednesday in which they renewed their commitment to
use intervention as a way to keep the dollar from falling further.
Intervention is the process by which governments buy currencies on
the open market in order to prop up their value.
   The bad trade number immediately tested the economic powers'
resolve as the dollar plunged precipitously, dropping below a level
of 125 yen. That benchmark is considered to be the target the
industrial powers are aiming at in their dollar-stabilization drive.
   Currency traders reported that the central banks of Germany, the
United States, England, Switzerland and Italy were intervening
today in an effort to break the dollar's fall.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, the prime architect of a
three-year effort to manage currency exchange rates, was grim-faced
and said nothing as he arrived for today's session of finance
ministers, being held as part of the spring meeting of the
151-nation International Monetary Fund.
   While Baker did not talk to reporters before the closed-door
sessions began, a text of his remarks to the finance ministers was
released later. In those comments, Baker played down the
significance of the February surge in the U.S. trade deficit.
   ``The trade figures released this morning should be seen in
context. As we have said before, too much emphasis should not be
placed on any one month's figures,'' Baker said. ``Monthly trade
figures are by their nature erratic.''
   Baker said the important thing to realize was that the overall
trend pointed to an improving U.S. trade performance this year. He
said one of the reasons for this optimistic view was the success
that the major industrial countries have had in coordinating an
economic policy.
   He said the United States has made great strides in cutting the
federal budget deficit while Japan, Britain and Germany have all
taken significant actions to boost domestic growth, efforts that
the United States has long urged as a way of increasing the demand
for American products.
   West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg also tried to
play down the significance of the one-month surge in the U.S. trade
deficit.
   ``It is a monthly figure. We do not expect that it will change
the basic trend,'' Stoltenberg said during a break in the
closed-door talks.
   Asked if the countries would now be forced to set a new base
level for the dollar, considering the fact that it had dropped
below the 125-yen level, Stoltenberg said, ``That is a very good
question, a thousand-dollar question.''
   Neither Stoltenberg nor Karl Otto Poehl, the head of the West
German central bank, would confirm that central banks were
intervening today to support the dollar.
   But Stoltenberg said, ``The central banks will cooperate. There
is no doubt. We announced it yesterday.''
   The so-called Group of Seven, including the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, issued a
two-page communique Wednesday reaffirming their Dec. 22 pact to
keep the international value of the dollar stable.
   But today's new assault on the dollar served to emphasize just
how difficult it may be to uphold that commitment.
   The United States and its six allies decided in September 1985
to push the dollar lower to correct America's huge trade deficit,
but the countries have been trying since February 1987 to halt the
currency's decline.
   The effort did not meet with much success last year, and the
steadily deteriorating dollar was cited as one of the reasons the
world's financial markets were thrown into turmoil last October.
   But since Dec. 22, the major industrial countries have crafted a
new strategy to stabilize the dollar and that agreement has held
for the past four months, backed up by periodic intervention in
currency markets, the process of buying the dollar to prop up its
value.
   Baker first unveiled his commodity price indicator at the last
meeting of the seven countries' finance leaders in September. Some
nations expressed skepticism then, wondering whether the idea was a
veiled effort to re-introduce a gold standard.
   But Baker picked up enough converts to get the proposal
endorsed, although other finance ministers stressed that many
details of the plan, including just what commodities to include,
still remain to be worked out.
   Baker has insisted that his approach is not an effort to return
to the gold-based monetary system that existed between the end of
World War II and 1973. For most of that time, the price of gold was
fixed at $35 an ounce and the currencies of other governments were
set at fixed rates based on the dollar.
   President Nixon broke the link with gold in 1973 as the
so-called Bretton Woods system crumbled under the weight of rising
inflation and large trade imbalances.
   In another victory for Baker, the joint statement Wednesday
singled out the newly industrialized countries in Asia for
criticism for their continued high trade surpluses. It urged those
nations to do more to lower their own barriers to other countries'
exports and to allow their currencies to rise in value in relation
to the dollar.
   These developments are seen as critical by the administration if
the United States is to make progess this year in reducing its
trade deficit, which hit a record $171 billion in 1987. Almost
one-fourth of that total came in trade with South Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore.

   Stock prices tumbled today on the surprise news
of an increase in the nation's trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 32.50 points to
2,074.60 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers swamped gainers by more than 7 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 182 up, 1,313 down
and 334 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February
from $12.44 billion the month before.
   That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who
had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between
imports and exports.
   The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the
news, and U.S. credit markets also took the news badly.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about $15 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8.9 percent
range. Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as
about 8.3 percent.
   Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve might soon feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped { to 115|; DuPont 1} to 85{; General Electric 1 to
41~; Ford Motor 1 to 46[, and USX 1[ to 33[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.13 to 151.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.76 at 303.03.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 88.75 million shares at
noontime, against 107.70 million at the same point Wednesday.

   The IRS, which has been giving wrong answers
to about 28 of every 100 telephoned tax questions, today offered
taxpayers some tips on how to avoid penalties for following such
bad advice.
   Penalties imposed for late filing of a return, negligence or
failure to pay taxes due may be waived if taxpayers can show
reasonable cause for their actions that led to the penalties, the
Internal Revenue Service said.
   The IRS said that in weighing whether a taxpayer who got
erroneous advice acted reasonably, it will consider:
   _Whether the taxpayer tried to get the correct answer to a tax
question from tax forms, instructions or official publications.
   _The actual question asked of and specific facts given to an IRS
telephone ``assister.''
   _The specific answer given the taxpayer.
   The agency indicated the taxpayer's case would be helped if he
or she took down the name of the employee who gave the bad advice
and the date and time of the call.
   The IRS said it is unlikely to waive penalties for paying taxes
with a bad check or for understating tax liability by more than
$5,000.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has returned an
86-count indictment against 12 individuals charging them with
conducting one of the largest tax-shelter frauds ever prosecuted in
the United States, officials announced Thursday.
   The indictment charges that defendants involved in a tax shelter
promoted OEC Leasing Corp., of Garden City, N.Y., in tax years 1982
and 1983. The indictment said the 12 obtained at least $30 million
from more than 4,000 taxpayers, costing the United States a
potential revenue loss of at least $65 million.
   The indictment also charges that a tax shelter promoted by First
Energy Leasing Corp., Melville, N.Y., obtained at least $14 million
from more than 1,900 taxpayers and cost the United States a
potential revenue loss of at least $23 million.
   Three of the 12 defendants, Frank J. Giuffrida of Belle Terre,
N.Y., Salvatore Giuffrida of Dix Hills, N.Y., and William B. Medina
of Port Jefferson, N.Y., are charged with racketeering in the form
of mail fraud and interstate transportation of securities and money.
   All 12 defendants, including those three, are charged with
conspiracy to defraud the United States, aiding the filing of false
tax returns, mail fraud and interstate transportation of securities
and money taken by fraud.
   Others charged in the indictment, released at a news conference
of the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Attorney's Office, are:
   _Zayle A. Bernstein, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   _William L. Eckard Jr., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   _Robert J. Cleary, Levittown, N.Y.
   _John A. DeRaffele, New Rochelle, N.Y.
   _Leo I. Tobin, Cherry Hill, N.J.
   _Irwin Berman, Crystal Lake, Pa.
   _Michael Enden, Port Washington, N.Y.
   _James E. Marcie, Coram, N.Y.
   _John Oster, Miller Place, N.Y.
   U.S. Attorney Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said the case developed
from leads that came to the Philadelphia office of the IRS. Dennis
said arrests would begin immediately.
   ``This prosecution involves a very sophisticated attempt to lure
taxpayers into making investments that would, according to their
promoters, result in many times the investment in tax savings,''
Dennis said.
   According to the scheme, investors would buy an energy-saving
device for $5,000, which they could use to obtain investment and
energy tax credits to save $20,000 to $30,000 in taxes during the
first year, Dennis said.

   Billionaire developer Harry Helmsley and his
wife, Leona, the self-styled hotel queen, were arraigned today on
tax evasion charges in state court, where they loudly proclaimed
their innocence.
   The Helmsleys, in ringing voices, replied, ``Not guilty,'' when
asked how they pleaded to charges involving the disguising of
millions of dollars in renovation costs for their estate as
business expenses.
   Also pleading innocent were Frank Turco, Mrs. Helmsley's former
top aide, and Joseph Licari, the couple's former financial manager.
   All four also were named in a 47-count federal indictment
containing similar charges. That indictment also charges Mrs.
Helmsley and Turco with extortion conspiracy; they allegedly
received kickbacks by threatening suppliers with a cutoff of
Helmsley business and by threatening Helmsley employees with loss
of their jobs.
   State prosecutors had asked that the Helmsleys each be required
to post $1 million bail, and that bail for their aides be set at
$100,000. But acting state Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman
released them on their own recognizance. A June 1 court date was
set.
   The trial-level judge said she was angry because news of the
indictments leaked earlier in the week.
   ``I am asking Mr. (Robert) Morgenthau (the Manhattan district
attorney) to investigate this grand jury leak. A crime has been
committed. This particular grand jury was under my supervision, and
I am quite upset that this information was leaked to the press,''
she said.
   Helmsley, 80, and his 68-year-old wife are one of the world's
wealthiest couples. Their holdings, including the Empire State
Building and the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are worth an estimated $1.4
billion.
   The couple arrived at the attorney general's office to surrender
in a gray limousine, followed by a second limousine carrying their
own security people.
   They said ``Good morning'' to reporters; when one reporter asked
Helmsley what his greatest achievement had been, he answered,
``Marrying her.''
   From the attorney general's office, the Helmsleys were taken to
police headquarters for booking and then to Manhattan Criminal
Court.
   In the courtroom, the Helmsleys sat quietly in the front row as
drug dealers and thieves were arraigned, and exchanged words from
time to time.
   The state indictment against each defendant included 139 counts
of falsifying business records; 44 counts of offering a false
instrument for filing; three counts of scheme to defraud; one count
of conspiracy; and one misdemanor count of scheme to defraud.
   The indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and
1986.
   The charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy, income
tax evasion, filing false and fraudulent income tax returns, mail
fraud and, for Mrs. Helmsley and Turco, conspiracy to commit
extortion.
   The Helmsleys are accused of disguising millions of dollars in
renovation costs on their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business
expenses and writing the bills off as tax deductions.
   Approximately $4 million was used to refurbish the mansion. That
money bought an enclosure for one of the estate's two pools; a
breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that
enclosure; installation of an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo
system; more than $200,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of
furniture and paintings.
   In addition, a $45,000 birthday present for Helmsley was billed
to and paid by the Park Lane Hotel in December 1984, and one or
more jade art objects worth $500,000 were paid for by four New York
City hotels as furniture purchases in 1984, according to the
charges.
   The federal indictment says there were four jade objects, and
estimates the value of the landscaping work at $370,000.
   On Wednesday, the Helmsleys' attorney, Stephen Kaufman,
denounced the tax-cheating accusations ``unfounded, unfair and
unjust.''
   ``The Helmsleys have paid more taxes to the government over the
years than practically any other individual in this city or
country,'' Kaufman said. ``In the last five years alone they have
paid more than $250 million in taxes.''
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and state Attorney General Robert
Abrams mounted a joint investigation into the Helmsleys' taxes 18
months ago.
   There were indications of legal action against the Helmsleys on
Monday, when they obtained a show cause order and filed a writ of
prohibition against Abrams in state Supreme Court.
   The papers were sealed by the judge, so it was not known what
the Helmsleys sought. A writ of prohibition can bar public
officials from actions ordinarily in their power, such as an
indictment or grand jury appearance.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who is featured in ads as the ``queen'' of a
string of hotels owned by her and her husband, turned down a deal
from prosecutors, who said they would not seek the indictment of
her husband if she pleaded guilty to fraud, a law enforcement
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press.

   Share prices tumbled Thursday after the U.S.
government reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit for
February.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 23.2
points, or 1.3 percent, lower at 1,787.2, after trading as high as
1,826.8, or 16.4 points up, ahead of the trade report.
   Dealers said the $13.83 billion trade deficit in February,
compared with a deficit of $12.44 billion in January, renewed fears
of a sharp downturn in stocks worldwide.
   The October stock markets' crash followed a poor U.S. trade
report.
   Volume was moderate at 517.3 million shares, down from 523.4
million on Wednesday.
   London shares were buoyed in morning business on continued
buying interest on news of British takeovers.
   But all was lost in a matter of minutes when the Commerce
Department announced its trade deficit widened in February instead
of narrowing to between $11.2 billion and $11.8 billion, as the
markets had expected.
   ``The figures were plainly bad, suggesting there's been no real
recovery in the (U.S.) trade situation at all,'' one dealer said.
   A sharply lower opening on Wall Street depressed the London
market further.
   Bob Semple, a U.K. equities strategist at County Natwest Wood
MacKenzie Ltd., said the equity market's sharp reaction to the U.S.
trade data reflected an underlying worry about whether ``the second
stage of the bear market (is) right around the corner.''

<HEAD>Financial Times Publisher Modifies Offer for Les Echos of France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pearson PLC, a British conglomerate that publishes
the Financial Times, said Wednesday it has modified the terms of
its offer for the Paris financial daily newspaper Les Echos.
   Pearson, which also has interests in banking, fine china and
oil, modified the 88 million pound, or $165 million, offer in an
effort to overcome apparent French government objections to the
takeover.
   Under the new offer, Les Echoso will continue to have a
substantial French-controlled minority shareholding for another
year.
   In addition, the new offer includes pledges that certain
minority stakes in Pearson will remain under French control.
   The French government said in February the Les Echos takeover
would require its approval, potentially a lengthy process, despite
Pearson's status as a European Community company.
   London analysts said the purchase of a newspaper by a non-French
company was a sensitive issue before the French presidential
elections.
   Pearson now hopes the French government will approve the
purchase before the April 24 elections, said a Pearson spokesman,
who was not identified in accordance with British practice.
   The French government never spelled out its precise reasons for
opposing the deal, but Pearson said it was apparently concerned
about publisher Rupert Murdoch's 20.4 percent stake in Pearson. If
Murdoch were to succeed in a takeover bid for Pearson, control of
Les Echos would pass outside the EC.
   The new proposals call for Pearson to acquire two-thirds of the
equity of Les Echos SA immediately and the remaining one-third a
year later, provided that Pearson is still an EC company.
   The original accord with Les Echos called for an outright
purchase of all the company's stock in exchange for the Pearson
shares and cash. The final purchase price remains the same, but
will now be made in two installents.
   The original purchase accord also involved the transfer of 7.4
million Pearson shares, or 3.6 percent, to Jacqueline Beytout, who
owns Les Echos, plus 355 million French francs, the equivalent of
$63 million, in cash.
   Under the new proposals, Ms. Beytout has guaranteed to give the
French bank Lazard Freres and Cie. the right of first refusal if
she decides to sell her Pearson shares.
   Lazard Freres, which has a separate 9.4 percent stake in Pearson
via its subsidiary Financiere and Industrielle Gaz and Eaux SA, has
pledged it also will remain a long-term holder of its Pearson
shares.
   The pledges are designed as a conciliatory move to reassure the
French government that the Beytout and Lazard stake in Pearson will
not be sold to Murdoch, the Pearson spokesman said.

<HEAD>Bank Settles With Three Utilities In WPPSS Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three utility districts have reached a $20
million settlement with bondholders who were left holding $2.25
billion in debt after the Washington Public Power Supply System
defaulted on bonds for two abandoned nuclear power plants.
   The settlement was announced Thursday by Junius Hoffman, a
court-appointed special master overseeing negotiations to settle a
huge lawsuit in the case. The securities-fraud suit is tentatively
set to go to trial in September in Tucson, Ariz.
   The settlement, still subject to final drafting as well as
formal approval by the court and utility district officials,
involves the Douglas, Chelan and Grant counties public utility
districts, Hoffman said.
   It comes two days after the city of Seattle announced it had
settled its part in the lawsuit for $50 million. City attorneys
said that was much less expensive than fighting the case and taking
the risk of being held responsible for all or part of the potential
$2.25 billion judgment.
   The latest settlement, worked out by attorneys for the utility
districts and for Chemical Bank, which represents the bondholders'
interests, brings the total of all settlements to $176 million. The
litigation continues against remaining defendants, who include the
supply system, utilities that sponsored the plants and others,
Hoffman noted.
   The bond default was the largest in the history of the municipal
bond market. The power system abandoned the two plants six years
ago following cost overruns and studies indicating the power from
the plants wasn't needed.
   The two abandoned plants, at the Hanford nuclear reservation in
south-central Washington and at Satsop, west of Olympia, were among
five nuclear power plants WPPSS attempted to build during the
1970s. One is currently operating at Hanford.
   The remaining two, also at Hanford and Satsop, were mothballed
when partially complete because of financing problems and doubts
about the need for the power they would produce.

   Four major media companies _ Gannett Co. Inc., Knight-Ridder
Inc., Tribune Co. and Media General Inc. _ said Thursday they each
had double-digit profit gains for the first quarter.
   After-tax profits were up 41 percent at Gannett, 18 percent at
Knight-Ridder, 93 percent at Tribune Co. and 42 percent at Media
General.
   Gannett, the Arlington, Va.-based publisher of USA Today and 89
other daily newspapers, said its profit rose to $74 million, or 46
cents a share, from $52.5 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same
quarter a year earlier. Operating revenue rose 8 percent to $757.9
million from $703.2 million.
   The latest results included a pre-tax gain of about $45 million
on its sale of stock in another company. A lower effective tax rate
also helped earnings, Gannett said.
   Gannett said overall newspaper advertising linage rose 4 percent
in the quarter, reflecting strength in classified advertising. It
said paid advertising pages rose 2 percent at USA Today while ad
revenue at the national newspaper rose 21 percent.
   Gannett said its broadcasting revenue rose 9 percent, while
outdoor advertising revenue were flat compared with last year's
results that had included revenue of a sign manufacturer sold last
year.
   In addition to its daily newspapers, Gannett publishes 35
non-daily newspapers and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine. It
operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News
Services and the largest outdoor ad company in the United States.
   Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, said its profit rose to $33.8
million, or 59 cents a share, in the first three months of the
year, compared with $28.6 million, or 49 cents a share, a year
earlier. Operating revenue increased 5.3 percent to $514.9 million
from $488.9 million in 1987.
   ``A lower tax rate, lower interest costs, excellent control of
other costs and a slightly smaller number of shares outstanding
helped us produce a good earnings gain for the quarter,'' said
Robert Singleton, senior Knight-Ridder vice president and chief
financial officer.
   Knight-Ridder owns 30 daily newspapers and eight television
stations.
   Tribune Co., based in Chicago, said its profit rose to $32.2
million, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter from $16.7 million, or
21 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $522
million from $477.1 million.
   The operating profit in Tribune's newspaper publishing group
rose 22 percent to $51.8 million on a 7 percent revenue increase to
$375 million. The company said the biggest improvement came at the
New York Daily News as a result of increased revenue and labor
savings.
   Tribune said the operating loss at its broadcasting and
entertainment group narrowed to $3.5 million from $10.1 million a
year earlier as revenue rose 7 percent to $91 million.
   Tribune also had a $23 million operating profit from newsprint
operations, up from $12.8 million a year earlier.
   Tribune owns nine daily newspapers, six television stations and
five radio stations.
   Media General, based in Richmond, Va., said its first-quarter
profit rose to $11.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $8.1
million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11.3
percent to $186 million from $167.1 million.
   Media General owns 4 daily and 32 weekly newspapers and has an
interest in 16 other daily newspapers. It owns three television
stations and two cable television systems that have about 175,000
subscribers.

   A pharmaceutical company said Thursday it has
begun selling a new leukemia drug, the fourth new cancer agent
since 1983 and the third leukemia drug in 10 years to gain federal
approval.
   Novantrone mitoxantrone hydrochloride is to be used in
combination with other agents for treating adults with acute
nonlymphocytic leukemia, Lederle Laboratories said in a statement.
   The disease strikes about 8,000 Americans a year, the statement
said. The drug apparently disrupts the functioning of genetic
material in cancer cells, the company said.
   Novantrone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
1987, but the agency's official rating of the drug indicates it
represents little or no advantage over other treatments.
   The other three new cancer drugs approved in the past five years
are etoposide for testicular cancer, approved in 1983; leuprolide
acetate for advanced prostate cancer, 1985; and interferon,
approved in 1986 to fight hairy cell leukemia, said Dr. John
Johnson of the FDA.
   Lederle is a division of American Cyanamid Co.

   Upjohn Co.'s sales of pharmaceuticals
and strength in animal health products helped boost the company's
first-quarter earnings 17.9 percent, the company said Thursday.
   Upjohn said it earned $95.4 million, or 51 cents a share, up
from $80.8 million, or 43 cents a share, in the same a year ago.
   The company reported sales of $662.4 million for the three
months ending March 31, up from $597.4 million in the first quarter
of 1987.
   Upjohn cited an 11 percent gain in worldwide sales of human
health care products, with strong performances by its Xanax and
Halcion agents for central nervous system disorders and Micronase,
an oral anti-diabetes agent.
   Rogaine, Upjohn's drug for male pattern baldness, has been
approved for marketing in 36 countries after approval in the United
Kingdom during the first quarter, and is a strong contributor to
foreign sales, the company said.
   Worldwide agricultural sales rose 12 percent, with gains for all
major animal health products, especially in foreign markets.
Naxcel, an antibiotic for bovine respiratory disease, made a strong
contribution to domestic sales after approval for U.S. use early in
the quarter, Upjohn said.

<HEAD>Wider U.S. Trade Deficit Sends the Dollar into a Tailspin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AM version expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended sharply lower in Europe Thursday
after news that the U.S. trade deficit widened in February sent the
currency into a tailspin that was only partially stemmed by
coordinated central bank intervention.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers had expected the trade deficit to narrow in February and
had built up long dollar positions _ or had bought dollars that
they hadn't yet agreed to sell _ which had to be quickly sold off.
   The dollar plummeted against most major currencies within
minutes of the Commerce Department announcement that the trade gap
had widened to $13.8 billion in February from $12.4 billion in
January.
   ``The trade figure caught everyone on the hop,'' said Marek
Stefanowicz, a corporate adviser at Nomura Bank International in
London.
   Within minutes of the start of the dollar's fall, the central
banks of the United States, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy,
Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands intervened to buy dollars,
dealers reported.
   Later, several of the central banks, notably the Deutsche
Bundesbank and The Bank of France, confirmed their intervention.
   The interventions were not particularily large, dealers
reported, but were effective because all the banks intervened at
once.
   The intervention did not push the dollar any higher but was able
to stem its decline.
   ``It is only the central banks keeping the dollar at these
levels,'' said a trader at a British merchant bank.
   In London, it cost $1.8755 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.8445 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's: 1.6635 West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3745
Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6390 French francs, down from
5.7295; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950; 1,244.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,252.50; and 1.2368 Canadian dollars, up from
1.23675.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 123.60 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $451.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $449.25. In Zurich, gold was higher,
closing at a bid $450.50 compared with $449.50 late Wednesday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.34 to close at a bid $449.48.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.43 a troy ounce, compared
with Wednesday's $6.41.

   Stock prices took a sharp drop today on the
surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 52.56 points to
2,054.54 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers swamped gainers by nearly 8 to 1 in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 182 up, 1,414 down and
313 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February
from $12.44 billion the month before.
   That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who
had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between
imports and exports.
   The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the
news, and U.S. credit markets also took the news badly.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about $15 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8.9 percent
range. Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as
about 8.3 percent.
   Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve might soon feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon,
activating for the second-time the ``collar'' set up by the NYSE in
early February. At that point the exchange asked its member firms
not to use its main computerized trading system for program trading.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped 1| to 114{; Exxon 1[ to 44]; General Electric 1\
to 41|; Ford Motor 1} to 45], and American Telephone & Telegraph 1
to 27.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.49 to 149.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.97 at 301.82.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 130.84 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Commerce Chief Opposes Soviet GATT Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity on
Thursday voiced opposition to suggestions that the Soviet Union
should be allowed to join an international trade organization.
   But Verity said the U.S. government's opposition to Soviet
participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
could change as the Soviet Union moves toward a market-oriented
economy. Some American businessmen supported admitting the Soviets
to the group.
   Verity spoke at a news conference after signing a protocol
endorsing joint Soviet-American business ventures.
   In September 1986, the United States led the opposition to a
Soviet effort to join GATT, a 95-nation group that sets
international trading rules.
   ``It would be inappropriate, perhaps impossible, to make any
progress if the Soviet Union was a member of GATT,'' Verity said.
But he added that ``in time, as the Soviet Union moves towards a
market economy, that would be different.''
   Verity said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika,'' or restructuring program, is designed ``to move
the Soviet economy toward a market economy, and that is important
to the Soviet side and to all other nations of the world who would
like to see movement in that direction.''
   Verity's trip to Moscow comes in advance of President Reagan's
five-day visit to the Soviet capital scheduled to begin May 29.
Trade frequently comes up during summit talks with Gorbachev, who
wants access to American technology and services to help improve
his country's ailing economy.
   Verity and Alexander I. Kachanov, Soviet first deputy minister
of foreign economic relations, signed a protocol adding joint
ventures to the types of cooperation encouraged by a 1974 trade
agreement.
   Verity's three days of talks with Kachanov coincided with a
Moscow meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council,
which attracted more than 400 American businessmen. Seven major
U.S. companies said Wednesday they formed a consortium to work out
business deals with the Soviets.
   Another company, Honeywell Inc., announced a joint venture on
Monday to supply automated production controls for Soviet
fertilizer factories.
   Verity said he stressed to Soviet officials that improvements in
trade depended on Soviet easing of emigration restrictions.
   He said the Soviets had agreed to ``marketing glasnost,'' using
the Russian word for openness that characterizes Gorbachev's drive
for freer expression.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Earnings More Than Double in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp., a leading producer of
power tools and household appliances, reported Thursday its second
quarter earnings more than doubled from the same period a year ago.
   Black & Decker said it earned $21.1 million, or 36 cents per
share, in the three-month period ending March 27, compared to
earnings of $9.3 million, or 16 cents per share, in the same
quarter a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose to $537.8 million from $438.7
million, the company said.
   For the last six months, net earnings rose 65 percent to $52.3
million, or 89 cents per share, compared to $31.6 million, or 54
cents per share, in the first six months of the previous fiscal
year.
   Six-month sales totaled $1.15 billion, up from $967.7 million.
   Nolan D. Archibald, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
``With manufacturing restructuring basically behind us, our stream
of new products and aggressive marketing programs are producing
consistently improved sales and earnings.''
   The quarterly earnings statement did not include expenses
related to the company's recent offer to buy American Standard,
Inc., or a $25 million settlement payment that the company will
receive if Kelso & Co. buys shares or assets of American Standard
on or before May 2.
   The payment is expected to offset Black & Decker's expenses in
the attempted takeover, the statement said. Black & Decker
abandoned the fight on March 22 after Kelso submitted a higher bid.

<HEAD>Ad Violates Court Order, Koppers Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. Thursday accused British investor
Brian Beazer of defying a federal judge by placing a newspaper ad
promoting his $1.7 billion hostile takeover attempt.
   ``You, our fellow shareholders, ought to ask: `How long must we
wait?' '' for Koppers' management to accept the $60-per-share
tender offer, the ad said.
   In papers filed with U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, Koppers
said the ad violates U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill's April 6
temporary restraining order. The order bars the Beazer group from
taking any actions to advance the takeover.
   Koppers said the ad also misrepresented Beazer's financial
backing and misrepresented court testimony by company Chairman
Charles R. Pullin and board member Charles Barber.
   Beazer spokeswoman Lissa Perlman in New York said that while the
Beazer group had not seen the complaint ``to the extent that it
criticizes our ad, we believe it is entirely frivolous and without
merit.''
   Koppers' resistance to the hostile offer, launched March 3 at
$45 per share and raised twice since, ``has deteriorated into one
of history's sorriest examples of management self-entrenchment,''
said the full-page ad in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
   The tender offer comes from BNS Inc., a takeover company formed
by the British industrialist's company, Beazer PLC, along with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of New York and National Westminster
Bank of Britain.

<HEAD>USG Eyes Ways To Gird Against Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. appears to be taking Desert Partners'
takeover attempt more seriously since the Texas-based partnership
increased its cash offer this week from $903 million to $1.63
billion, an analyst said Thursday.
   USG says it is now considering a number of options for remaining
independent, possibly indicating a change in its attitude toward
Desert Partners, said Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst for the
Chicago-based investment research firm Duff & Phelps Inc.
   He said USG had been resisting Desert Partners ``with a
no-comment, no-action, let's-see-what-they-come-up-with sort of
approach.
   ``But maybe Desert Partners at this level is starting to look a
little threatening to them,'' Kleinaitis said. ``Given Desert
Partners' persistence in this deal, you'd think USG would have to
do something.''
   Desert Partners, controlled by oilmen Jack Brown and Cyril
Wagner Jr. of Midland, Texas, has maintained since it announced its
initial offer in February that it is truly interested in acquiring
the Chicago-based building-products producer.
   But skeptical analysts have speculated that Brown and Wagner's
real intent was either to boost the value of USG's stock so they
could sell their 9.8-percent stake in the company at a good profit
or to bully USG's management into paying them off to drop the
takeover bid.
   On Monday, Desert Partners said it would pay $42 cash per share
for up to 39 million shares of USG's outstanding stock. Previously,
Desert Partners had been seeking to buy only 21.5 million shares at
$42 a share.
   If Desert Partners were to obtain all the shares it is now
seeking, it would own 85 percent of USG. USG has urged its
stockholders not to tender their shares to Desert Partners, which
said about 12.6 million shares had been tendered as of last Friday.
   USG's board met Monday to discuss Desert Partners' latest move,
then filed a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
saying it was exploring options to remain independent.
   The options mentioned in the filing included selling part of USG
to a third party for cash or assets, recapitalizing the company or
repurchasing its own stock.
   Any of those actions would make it difficult for Desert Partners
to obtain the shares it is seeking.
   Frederic Spar, a spokesman for Desert Partners, said Thusday
that the offer for more shares should leave no doubt about the
Texas group's intentions.
   ``There should be no doubt that Desert Partners has been
interested in acquiring USG for quite some time,'' he said. ``That
commitment is underscored by the fact that they have now put up a
substantial amount of money in commmitment fees for the financing
and expenses related to the tender offer.''

   The Senate today approved a $1.1 trillion
federal budget for fiscal 1989 after earlier deciding not to shift
$50 million in spending from energy research to health care
programs.
   The spending plan was passed on a 69-26 vote. The Senate and the
House, which passed its version of the budget earlier, must now
agree on a compromise measure.
   Senators earlier had voted 57-38 against a proposal that would
have transferred $50 million away from the superconducting super
collider, a physics research program planned by the government and
expected to cost about $4.4 billion ultimately. There still would
have been $40 million in spending left next year for the massive
project.
   The amendment would have used the money instead for childhood
immunizations, community health centers, and to train nurses and
other health care workers to take care of the elderly.
   ``It speaks to ... kids, old folks, poor people,'' Sen. Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn., the amendment's author, said of it. ``Their lives
today are as important as our other knowledge in the future.''
   But opponents who spoke, most from the seven states competing
for the super collider, argued that the project's scientific and
economic benefits were too great to jeopardize.
   ``We can protect the health of our citizens without jeopardizing
the economic health of our nation,'' said Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn., whose state is seeking the project.
   Senate passage put Congress on track to completing its budget
work unusually early in the year, largely because the summit
agreement between President Reagan and congressional leaders solved
most of the normally testy problems.
   But one of the questions the summit allegedly tamed _ how much
money the government will spend on domestic programs _ reared its
head Wednesday.
   That occurred when the lawmakers voted 93-0 to add $1.4 billion
for drug programs such as law enforcement and prison construction,
a measure legislators found difficult to oppose in an election year.
   The budget originally allowed $148.1 billion in domestic
spending, the cap set in the summit pact.
   To get around that, the amendment's supporters said the drug
spending would only occur if it could be paid for by better
collection of taxes and debts owed the government. And they noted
that the summit accord provided for additional spending in cases of
a ``dire emergency.''
   Asked if he believed the White House would accept the extra
spending, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who wrote the provision
with Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said, ``They're damned fools
if they don't recognize it's a dire emergency.''
   The Senate had earlier approved another anti-drug measure by a
76-18 vote, adding $125 million for federal prisons and agents. The
language, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., provided the
money by reducing federal travel spending.
   The lawmakers began considering amendments after untangling
themselves from arguments that began Monday, when they began
debating the budget, over the spending plan's $136 billion deficit.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the budget committee,
argued that the real size of the deficit was cloaked because the
huge surpluses of the Social Security system are included in the
fiscal calculations.
   Soon, lawmakers began trying to remove other special funds _
covering money set aside for transportation, banking and other
programs _ from the deficit computations.
   Eventually, an amendment sponsored by Sen. Pete V. Domenici of
New Mexico, ranking Republican on the budget panel, was approved
that handed the problem to the National Economic Commission, which
will suggest answers to budget problems next year.
   Other than the new domestic spending, the budget follows the
summit pact's strictures. It contains no new taxes, since $14
billion in new levies called for by the summit have already been
enacted.
   It also allows $294 billion for military spending and $16.1
billion for international assistance.
   The major differences between the Senate budget and the spending
plan Reagan proposed in February are in domestic spending. The
Senate would spend more on energy, agriculture, housing and
community development than the president, and less on natural
resources, law enforcement and income security.
   Like the president, the Senate would give vast boosts to
spending for space and science, education, and aviation safety.
   The proposal's computed deficit of $136 billion meets precisely
the deficit target set in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law for
fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The law is designed to eliminate
the government's red ink by 1993.
   The House approved its version of the budget last month. The two
chambers must approve identical spending blueprints, but the
president's signature is not required.
   The budget is not binding. It is used as a guide by Congress as
it passes legislation that actually provides money for federal
programs.

   A federal judge said Batus Inc. can
continue to seek proxies in support of a non-binding resolution
asking that Farmers Group Inc. negotiate with Batus over a takeover
attempt.
   U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben of Reno, Nev. denied on
Wednesday a preliminary injunction Farmers Group sought against
Batus regarding the solicitation of proxies.
   But McKibben ordered Batus to clarify a statement in the
stockholder resolution the company will submit at Farmers' annual
meeting May 20, according to a release issued Thursday by Batus.
   Batus said in a news release it was pleased with the ruling.
   ``Once again, we say to Farmers that there is no need for all
this legal maneuvering,'' Batus said. ``We are ready to sit down
and negotiate all points in our offer, including a possible
increase in price in a friendly transaction supported by the
Farmers board.''
   The resolution recommends that the Farmers' board reconsider its
decision not to negotiate with Batus over the sale. The statement
ordered rephrased said a vote in favor of the resolution would
indicate shareholder support for the sale of Farmers to Batus.
   McKibben said the statement needed to be clarified in order to
conform to the literal wording of the resolution.
   Batus, the Louisville-based subisdiary of Britain's BAT
Industries, has said it was willing to raise its $63-per-share bid,
but refused on Wednesday to meet Farmers' ground rules for
negotiations.
   Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer and
seventh-largest property and casualty insurer, insisted it would
not sit down unless Batus agreed to keep certain information
confidential. Farmers also asked Batus to reveal how much it was
willing to pay for the company.
   Batus, whose U.S. businesses include Kool and Viceroy cigarettes
and retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, responded by proposing
alternate confidentiality provisions.
   Farmers, which is based in Los Angeles, has about $11 billion in
assets.
   Batus earned $886 million on revenue of $5.8 billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. said Thursday its
first-quarter profit jumped 35.8 percent as its film and music
divisions each turned in best-ever quarterly performances.
   Warner said its earnings rose to $89.1 million, or 56 cents per
share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with a profit of
$65.6 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 22 percent to $960.8 million for the quarter from
$788.3 million in 1987.
   The company said its filmed entertainment division had an
operating profit of $55.3 million, up 17 percent from a year ago
and its highest profit for any quarter in the division's history.
   The results were helped by sharply higher results from Warner
Bros.' international distribution of films such as Steven
Spielberg's ``Innerspace'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal
Jacket.''
   Strong domestic and international home video sales, pay
television and television syndication revenue also contributed
significantly, Warner said.
   Warner said its recorded music and music publishing divisions
had operating income of $70.5 million, up 50 percent from a year
earlier and its highest quarterly performance ever.
   Million-selling releases by artists such as INXS, Debbie Gibson,
David Lee Roth, George Harrison, and Foreigner contributed to the
record-setting performance, the company said.
   Warner Cable's results more than doubled to $15.5 million, but
losses at BHC Inc., the television station operation in which
Warner has a 42.5 percent stake, left the cable and broadcasting
division's earnings at $13.5 million, up from $5.3 million a year
earlier.
   The company's publishing division had first-quarter earnings of
$2 million, down from $2.5 million in 1987.

   A late rally pushed grain and soybean futures to
a mixed close Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, possibly
marking the end of a recent sharp downturn in prices.
   Prices had fallen on Tuesday and Wednesday and continued lower
on Thursday until shortly before the closing bell, when C&D
Commodities, the largest speculative trading firm on the floor,
began buying contracts and sparked ``a spectacular closing rally,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``They were the catalyst for the break and they were the
catalyst for the turnaround late in the session,'' Lespinasse said.
``The market turned on a dime and ended up closing on a very firm
note.''
   He said the action could indicate an end to the recent downturn,
which came on heavy profit-taking after last week's dramatic gains.
   Soybeans finished higher, corn was mixed and wheat finished
slightly lower.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.16\ a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.04\ a bushel; oats were }

<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter profits at Motorola Inc.
were more than double those of a year ago, thanks to sharply
increased sales of its electronic equipment, the company said
Thursday.
   For the first three months of 1988, Motorola reported net income
of $114 million, or 88 cents a share, compared to $56 million, or
44 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales increased 26 percent, to $1.95 billion from $1.55 billion
a year earlier, the suburban Chicago company said in a statement.
   First-quarter sales of Motorola's paging and two-way radio
systems advanced 25 percent while sales of its semiconductor
products jumped 31 percent. New orders in both divisions reached
the highest level in the company's history, said George Fisher,
president and chief executive officer.
   Sales in Motorola's General Systems Group, which includes
computer and cellular telephone businesses, rose 35 percent, and
sales of electronic equipment for government applications were up
23 percent for the quarter, the company said.
   Chairman Robert W. Galvin expressed satisfaction with the
results and said he was optimistic about the company's future.
   ``We are delivering higher quality products and services in less
time,'' Galvin said. ``Our customers use these products to improve
their productivity, which builds further momentum for long-term
growth in the years to come.''

<HEAD>GM Adds Second Shift at Truck Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,300 laid-off autoworkers will be
called back to work as General Motors Corp. adds a second shift at
its full-size pickup truck plant here, GM said Thursday.
   Most of the workers will come from a pool of 1,050 United Auto
Workers Local 594 members furloughed from three GM Truck & Bus
Group plants in Pontiac.
   But about 300 to 400 laid-off Flint-area workers also are
eligible to transfer into the plant, said UAW Vice President Donald
Ephlin, who heads the union's GM department.
   ``It's wonderful news. We've got a good product here and a good
work force,'' said Don Douglas, president of Local 594, which
represents about 9,500 active and laid-off truck workers in Pontiac.
   The recalls will begin gradually within 30 days so GM can give
workers new to the plant extensive training before the plant begins
building 1989 models, said Charles Katko, a GM vice president and
Truck & Bus Group executive.
   Sales of the new Chevrolet C-K and GMC Sierra pickups,
introduced last year, have risen steadily since the start of the
year. Sierra sales have risen 18.4 percent since Jan. 1 while C-K
sales rose 22.7 percent.
   The Pontiac East plant employs 2,000 workers _ 1,750 hourly and
250 salaried. When the second shift reaches full speed, it will
employ 1,250 additional hourly and 50 additional salaried workers.
   GM earlier this year announced plans to boost companywide
production by about 175,000 vehicles for 1988, most of it in
trucks. Last year, GM and other automakers had trimmed production
plans in an effort to reduce inventory backlogs. But sales in the
first quarter surpassed expectations.

<NOTE>Eds: Figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report are for the

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 419 money market mutual
tumbled $2.02 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $274.8 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.43 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 210 general purpose funds fell $1.41 billion to $82.23
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds fell $97.4 million to
$117.3 billion, and assets of 112 institutional funds fell $519.8
million to $75.24 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.10 percent from 6.05 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield edged up to 6.06 percent from 6.05
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, the same as the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
5.67 percent as of Wednesday from 5.68 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.82
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.81 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.14 percent on 1-year CDs,
unchanged; 7.57 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.56 percent; and
8.01 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices and the dollar plunged and interest
rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade
deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped about
101 points, while in the currency markets the value of the dollar
fell 2 percent against major currencies. Interest rates on a key
long-term U.S. Treasury bond jumped to a three-month high.
   Traders scrambled to sell dollars, bonds and stocks after the
Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's trade
deficit had risen to $13.8 billion in February. That was the
biggest shortfall since the record of $17.6 billion in October and
the second monthly increase in a row. Many economists had been
expecting the deficit to narrow.
   The Dow Jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of
the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange then stabilized for
a few hours. But the slide resumed in the afternoon and the average
skidded to a 101.46-point loss at 2,005.63, a 4.8 percent drop,
according to a prelimary calculation.
   It was the worst decline since the Dow plunged 140.58 points on
Jan. 8.
   The Dow's decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of
computerized program trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the
first time the ``collar'' has been triggered by a decline of 50
points or more in the Dow.
   Prices also fell on the London Stock Exchange, where the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 1.3 percent,
dropping 23.2 points to 1,787.2.
   Currency brokers reported the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, concerned about a rout in the dollar, swooped into foreign
exchange markets to buy dollars with Japanese yen, British pounds
and West German marks to try to stabilize the currency's value.
   The dollar was down about 1.9 percent against the British pound,
about 1.9 percent against the West German mark and about 2.2
percent against the Japanese yen at midafternoon.
   The impact also was felt in the bond market, an important
barometer of the economy and interest rates. By late afternoon,
prices of the key 30-year Treasury bond were down 1\ points, or
about $12.50 for every $1,000 in face amount, and its yield, which
moves inversely to price, surged to 8.855 percent, the highest in
three months.
   The bulge in the trade deficit suggested America's trade
problems remain more stubborn than earlier believed, leading some
traders to believe that the dollar needs to fall further to make
U.S. goods more competitive in the global market.
   However, Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency
Economics, noted that the February deficit was smaller than the
deficit of $14.4 billion in February 1987, indicating that trade
flows are improving.
   Central banks that bought dollars to halt the currency's slide
ranged across the board, from the Bank of Italy to the central bank
of Australia, said Marc Chandler, a currency analyst in Chicago for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A seven-nation accord announced Wednesday in Washington had
little effect on the currency market, Chandler said, because it
merely reaffirmed a December agreement by finance officials of the
countries to support the dollar.
   The seven nations are the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain,
France, West Germany and Italy.

<TEXT>
   Four major bank holding companies _ Chemical New York Corp.,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Security Pacific Corp. and Bank of New
York Co. _ reported sharp rises Thursday in their first quarter
profits from a year ago.
   Analysts said the results generally were in line to slightly
better than expected and showed that the banks' continuing efforts
to trim expenses were paying off.
   Chemical, the nation's fourth-largest banking company, said net
income for the first three months of this year rose 45.6 percent,
to $125.5 million, or $1.95 a share, from $86.2 million, or $1.58 a
share, a year ago.
   Manufacturers Hanover, ranked sixth, reported a 73.2 percent
jump in its earnings, to $140.3 million, or $2.56 a share, from
$81.0 million, or $1.68 a share, in first quarter 1987.
   Security Pacific, No. 7, netted $147.2 million, or $1.30 a
share, compared with $116.5 million, or $1.06 a share.
   No. 26 Bank of New York, which is engaged in a hostile battle to
acquire Irving Bank Corp., reported net earnings of $54.4 million,
or $1.47 a share. That was up 15 percent from $47.3 million, or
$1.32 per share, a year earlier. ``Most banks have been pretty good
restraining overhead costs. That has helped the results,'' said
Stephen Berman, a banking analyst with County Securities USA. ``Fee
income and trading activity is also very strong.''
   Chemical said fees for trust and other banking services totaled
$211.1 million, up 33.9 percent from the previous year. It said
securities trading profits were $32.7 million in the quarter, up
from $21.9 million last year.
   The company also said its provision for loan losses rose to
$105.6 million from 87.2 million.
   Manufacturers Hanover said it lowered its loan-loss provision to
$141.6 million from $152.5 million last year.
   The company also reported big increases in trading revenue and
other fees. Revenue from all trading activities was $67.3 million,
up 72.4 percent from $39.1 million in the first quarter.
   ``Strong core operating results were in line with what we had
been projecting, and our financial plan to replenish common
shareholders' equity is on track,'' Chairman John F. McGillicuddy
stated.
   As part of that plan, Manufacturers Hanover announced earlier
this week it reached an agreement in principle to sell its consumer
finance subsidiary, Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services Inc.
   Security Pacific Chairman Richard J. Flamson III said his bank
also was beginning to see positive results from its programs to
control expense growth. ``We expect to be implementing more new
expense reduction plans ...'' he said.
   At Bank of New York, Chairman J. Carter Bacot said strong
performances by the company's core businesses contributed to the
overall earnings growth. Core businesses at Bank of New York are
corporate banking, securities processing, retail banking and trust
and investment management.

   The dollar plunged on foreign exchange markets
Thursday after traders were shocked by an unexpected jump in the
U.S. trade deficit.
   ``The market was caught by surprise,'' said Ron Sapiro, a vice
president at Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in
Chicago.
   Financial markets had expected the trade gap to shrink in
February from its January level of $12.4 billion, so when the
Commerce Department announced a $13.8 billion deficit Thursday
morning, panic selling of dollars set in, Sapiro said.
   But gold prices benefited from the report. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a bid of $452.65 for a troy ounce of gold
as of 4 p.m. EDT, up more than $6 from late Wednesday's $446.60.
   The central banks of several nations, including the Federal
Reserve, bought dollars to help stabilize the currency, but the
dollar still lost about 2 percent of its value against the West
German mark, British pound and Japanese yen.
   ``They stemmed what would have been a momentary freefall,'' said
Varick Martin, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland, of
the banks' intervention.
   Martin said the dollar fell 2 pfennigs against the mark
immediately after the trade report, regained some ground and then
fell again before closing near its lows for the day.
   The trade report came on the heels of an agreement among the
Group of Seven industrial nations that reaffirmed a Dec. 22 pact to
keep the dollar stable. Martin said that agreement contributed to
the dollar's slide.
   ``The (dollar) rates on Dec. 22 were substantially lower (than
they are now),'' Martin said, suggesting that the currency markets
interpreted the ministers' agreement as supporting the dollar at
lower levels.
   Martin predicted traders would test the dollar at its lower
levels to see if the central banks will again step in to support
the U.S. currency.
   If the dollar does not resume its fall Friday ``it will come
back somewhat,'' Sapiro said. However, he did not expect any
dramatic improvement.
   In London, it cost $1.8755 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.8445 late Wednesday. In later New York trading, sterling jumped
to $1.8739 from $1.83755 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.66275 West German marks, down from
1.6950; 1.3720 Swiss francs, down from 1.4055; 5.6325 French
francs, down from 5.74375; 1,233.00 Italian lire, down from
1,255.75; and 1.2365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23775.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's, rates, included: 1.6635 West German marks, down from
1.6895; 1.3745 Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6390 French
francs, down from 5.7295; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950;
1,244.00 Italian lire, down from 1,252.50; and 1.2368 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.23675.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ended before the trade figures
came out, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 123.60 yen and in New York, it fell to
123.725 yen from 126.44 late Wednesday.
   Gold bullion prices rose in response to the trade report, said
Steven Pepper, vice president and bullion dealer at Republic
National Bank.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold
climbed to $454 from $447 late Wednesday.
   The metal's gain was smaller in earlier London trading. Gold
closed there at a late bid price of $451.00 a troy ounce, compared
with late Wednesday's $449.25. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$450.50 compared with $449.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.34 to close at a bid $449.48.
   Silver was up on the Comex in New York, closing at $6.450 a troy
ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $6.325. In earlier London
trading, silver traded at a late bid price of $6.43 a troy ounce,
compared with Wednesday's $6.41.

   Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
failed Thursday to win shareholder support in his takeover battle
for the massive holding company Societe Generale de Belgique SA.
   More than 12 hours after a special meeting began in a tent next
to the company's headquarters, a final count showed De Benedetti
and his allies were unable to gain three seats on the company's
board of directors.
   The long-awaited tally, further delayed by computer problems,
showed the De Benedetti faction garnered only about 44.5 percent of
the votes in a special election, short of the 51 percent necessary
to win seats.
   But a slate of 12 candidates endorsed by Societe Generale did
win a majority, further bolstering the company's ability to remain
a Belgian enterprise.
   More than 1,150 shareholders who control 75 percent of Belgium's
largest holding company attended the meeting, which began under
tight security shortly after 10 a.m. local time.
   De Benedetti, who sparked the heated takeover battle for Societe
Generale three months ago, topped a list of 15 candidates seeking
board seats. He hoped to be elected along with two allies,
including Andre Leysen, chairman of Belgium's Gevaert NV.
   Societe Generale nominated the remaining candidates, most of
whom were allied with France's Cie. Financiere de Suez and Groupe
AG, Belgium's largest insurer. The two companies have led the fight
against De Benedetti.
   Societe Generale's current 11 directors will remain, and the
board will be expanded to include the 12 new members endorsed at
the meeting. There is no maximum number of directors that can serve
on the company's board.
   Among the new directors are six members of the Suez group and
Groupe AG Chairman Maurice Lippens.
   The vote also was expected to serve as an indication of how many
shares each faction controls. Under Belgian law, shareholders are
not required to disclose the amount of their holdings, leaving only
speculation as to which group is in the majority.
   De Benedetti, who spent some $1.7 billion to increase his
Societe Generale holdings, claims he and his allies control 48
percent of the company.
   But Suez and Groupe AG have said they hold 50.7 percent, after
spending about $850 million to beef up their stake.
   Yet even with a minority interest De Benedetti can hamper the
decision-making process.
   ``Without me ... no stable management of Societe Generale is
possible,'' he asserted at the meeting, which he requested.
   An eleventh-hour attempt to reach an accord between the rival
factions failed Wednesday night.
   Lippens of Groupe AG indicated De Benedetti refused an offer to
have a significant voice in a new management group. ``We deeply
regret an important shareholder has refused to take a place at the
table,''he said.
   Rather than be a team player, De Benedetti wants to run Societe
Generale's day-to-day operations and vowed to continue to seek
control of the giant company.
   ``Today's votes will not be for the long term,'' he said. ``In
one week, one month, six months or one year, we will play a major
role in Societe Generale.''
   Some officials at Thursday's special meeting concurred, saying
they expect De Benedetti will win a board seat in the future.
   De Benedetti,who heads Italy's Olivetti SpA, wants to turn
Societe Generale into a pan-European holding company before 1992,
when the European Economic Community is scheduled to remove
regulatory curbs that hamper the free movement of goods and
services. He said he launched his bid ``to anticipate'' a
borderless Europe.
   Both De Benedetti and his rivals seek to restructure Societe
Generale, which has interests in mining, engineering,
manufacturing, chemicals, banking, financial services and other
areas.
   De Benedetti is fighting a legal battle over Societe Generale's
issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to dilute his
stake. The action was taken on Jan. 18, the same day De Benedetti
launched his hostile bid.

   One week before planned floor debate on
sweeping trade legislation, lawmakers remain deeply split over
whether to require public disclosure of foreign investment in the
United States.
   ``I think Americans should be allowed to know who is investing
in this country,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told
reporters Wednesday. ``I don't see any justification for secrecy.''
   But Wright hinted that within the week leaders might yield to
the Reagan administration and other critics and bar the provision
sponsored by Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, from the 1,000-page trade
bill.
   Actually, the Bryant amendment is not even part of the bill. A
panel attempting to draft a compromise between rival House and
Senate versions of the trade measure was unable to reach agreement
on foreign investment disclosure and simply left the issue hanging.
   The provisions in Bryant's amendment are complex.
   They would require foreigners and overseas-based companies to
register with the Commerce Department if they owned 5 percent or
more of an American company or real estate in the United States if
assets of the property were worth at least $5 million.
   Such an investor would be required to disclose his name,
address, nationality, principal business, share in the U.S.
investment, date that it was acquired, the purchase price, location
of the property, its name and the primary business in which it was
involved.
   Some of this information already must be filed with the Commerce
Department, but is not publicly available. It would be under
Bryant's plan.
   Companies with a 25 percent share in a U.S. business or property
with assets or annual sales of more than $20 million would have to
disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission on its 10-K form. The
items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial
balance sheet.
   As soon as Bryant introduced the measure, it caused an uproar.
It flies in the face of business secrecy customs strictly observed
for centuries throughout much of the world. Indeed, business
disclosure laws are carefully drawn and limited within the United
States.
   Critics of the amendment say it would immediately cut off the
flow of capital to the United States from overseas and cause
economic disaster.
   ``If we impede that flow, we will be slitting our own economic
throats,'' declared Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., who has fought the
amendment repeatedly as a member of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   One of the first victims would be such financial markets as the
New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade where
foreigners are regular investors, Lent said.
   ``Buying in London, Toyko and other markets will flourish at the
expense of New York and Chicago and our markets, which are envied
throughout the world, will be impaired,'' he argued. He scoffed at
the notion that foreign investment constitutes a danger and thus
should be publicly spotlighted.
   ``If you wake up in the morning and say that foreign investment
is evil, is dangerous, that is a kind of naive, xenophobic view,''
Lent said.
   British Ambassador Antony Acland said in a March 15 letter to
Lent that the Bryant amendment would affect some British companies
that invest in the United States and ``put them at a real
commercial disadvantage.''
   ``It would discourage new investment from Britain,'' Acland said
in the letter, which Lent inserted in the March 29 Congressional
Record.
   Bryant waves such objections aside, citing figures suggesting
that foreign investment in farmland, factories, banks, businesses,
buildings, government securities and elsewhere within the U.S.
economy has shot up over the last seven years.
   ``Foreign money has been financing a record borrowing binge,
while disguising the fact that we are living dangerously beyond our
means,'' Bryant said.
   ``Floating on a feather bed of foreign financing, the United
States has fallen from its status as the world's largest creditor
nation in 1982 to become the largest debtor nation in history, with
a foreign debt exceeding those of Mexico, Argentina and Brazil
combined,'' he added.
   The administration sent out strong signals over the last few
months that President Reagan would veto the trade bill if it
contained Bryant's plan.
   That threat supplied powerful ammunition to the measure's
critics on Capitol Hill.
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., sought to break the deadlock at one point
with a modification under which the need for disclosure would be
studied and existing Commerce Department information would be shown
to lawmakers on a confidential basis.
   Administration officials, however, sent back word that this
proposal also would be likely to provoke a veto, and the idea was
dropped.
   Not much information about foreign ownership of U.S. property
exists in the public domain. However, studies have shown that
citizens of other countries held title to less than one percent of
U.S. farmland.
   But the sheer volume of ownership is not the sole issue, Bryant
contends. He said it is important that Americans know exactly who
owns what.
   ``Because of the lack of adequate reporting requirements,'' he
said, ``we cannot determine whether new foreign owners of U.S.
assets are legitimate businesses, hostile nations like Libya, Iran
or the Soviet Union, corrupt Third World dictators like the
Philippines' (Ferdinand) Marcos or organized drug traffickers
laundering their ill-gotten gains.''

<TEXT>
   The monthly U.S. trade deficit widened by more
than 11 percent in February to $13.8 billion, the government said
Thursday, sending both stock prices and the dollar on a nosedive.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks plummeted 101
points or by about 5 percent and the value of the dollar against
the Japanese yen and the German mark dropped about 2 percent on the
foreign exchange markets.
   Only concerted intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank and
central banks in Europe in buying up large volumes of dollars with
yen, marks and British pounds prevented the dollar from falling
further.
   Triggering the turmoil was the Commerce Department's report that
the gap between the nation's imports and exports expanded by $1.4
billion from January's imbalance of $12.4 billion.
   It was the second straight monthly jump in the trade imbalance
that had declined in November and December from a record $17.6
billion defict last October.
   ``We've stumbled here a little bit,'' said Jay Goldinger, an
analyst for Capital Insight, an economic consulting firm based in
Los Angeles. ``It reminds us that we have a major, major problem.''
   Analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the February
deficit would shrink slightly, the normal seasonal pattern for this
time of year.
   ``For the second time in only seven years, there was huge,
atypical increase in imports in February, showing that Americans
have not lost their appetite for foreign goods,'' said Allen Sinai,
an economist for the Boston Co. of New York.
   ``It means we have not solved the budget and trade deficit
problems,'' Sinai said. ``And if policymakers and consumers don't
tighten their belts, the markets will, showing up in a tumbling
dollar, spikes in interest rates and ultimately, in a recession,
although not likely this year.''
   Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products
increased by $2.6 billion in February to $37.4 billion. Leading the
surge were imports of electrical equipment from abroad, up $323
million, and auto and truck parts, up $298 million.
   American exports also rose, but by a smaller $1.2 billion from
January to $23.6 billion.
   For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an
annual rate of $157.6 billion, below the record $171.2 billion for
all of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of
$156.2 billion in 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   ``The nation's trade problems are severe and far from over,''
said Rudy Oswald, the AFL-CIO's chief economist. ``While exports
are up by $10 billion from a year ago, so are imports, leaving
America no further along the path towards reducing the
jobs-destroying deficit.''
   Reagan administration officials downplayed the February numbers,
instead focusing on longer trends that show a grudgingly slow
improvement since last summer. The trade deficit over the last
three months has averaged $12.8 billion compared with a monthly
average of $15 billion the previous three months.
   ``Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic,'' said
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker. ``The figures seen this morning
should be seen in context.''
   With both exports and imports higher than they were in January,
Vice President George Bush said there is no reason for alarm.
   ``So the market goes down a little bit,'' he said. ``The same
thing happened last fall, and there's a great frenzy for no reason.
I certainly don't see it as a reason to pass protectionist
legislation, which is the undercurrent of the opposition's
program.''
   U.S. oil imports jumped 1.2 million barrels a day in February to
8.1 million, the highest they have been since September 1986. As a
result, the trade deficit with members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries shot up by $270 million over January
to $1.3 billion.
   The deficit with Japan, the country with the largest trade
surplus with the United States, also increased dramatically, by
$500 million to more than $4.5 billion.
   But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized
countries _ Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea _ falling
by about $20 million to $2.9 billion.
   Imports of manufactured goods from abroad increased by $2.3
billion in February and were $1.8 billion higher than the monthly
average of $27.1 billion in 1987.
   ``The United States is not building its capital stock
sufficiently to meet domestic demand,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
``The foreign sourcing during the period of the high dollar
continues to represent a source of troubling import dependency.''
   But U.S. manufacturers also fared better in February, raising
their exports by $1.2 billion to $16.1 billion, the third highest
month on record after November and December of last year.
   Despite the increase in auto and truck parts shipped here from
abroad, exports of Japanese autos themselves to the United States
declined by more than $120 million to $1.5 billion in February.
   Auto imports from other countries, however, rose by nearly $390
million.
   Agricultural exports _ chiefly big increases in animal feeds,
cotton and soybeans _ rose by $280 million over January to $3.2
billion, the highest they have been since 1984.

<HEAD>Gillette Suit Seeks To Block Coniston Takeover Effort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. filed suit Thursday in U.S. District
Court seeking to block a hostile takeover bid by a New York-based
partnership on the grounds the company withheld or falsified
reports about its financial backing.
   The suit seeks a temporary injunction to prevent Coniston Group
or its subsidiaries from acquiring additional Gillette stock or
taking action to oust four Gillette directors at an April 21 annual
meeting.
   Gillette claims Coniston violated federal laws by issuing
material to Gillette shareholders which failed to properly cite all
partners and investors affiliated with the takeover attempt.
   A Gillette statement reports the suit stems from Coniston's
April 11 admendment to an SEC filing which ``confirms for the first
time that hidden partners and participants in the Coniston effort
against Gillette include a complicated web or foreign and domestic
corporations and partnerships.''
   The suit names Coniston principals Augustus K. Oliver, Paul E.
Tierney Jr. and Keith R. Gollust as defendants. Also named in the
suit are: Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti; Oakley Sutton Management
Inc. principals James Sutton Regan and Edward Oakley Thorp; and
Michael F. Price, president of Heine Securities Corp.
   Gillette alleges Heine and two Oakley subsidiaries purchased
Gillette stock as part of Coniston's takeover attempt. Neither firm
was noted as part of Coniston's holdings in the April 11 filing,
Gillette alleges.
   New York-based Heine had acquired 2.35 million Gillette shares
as of Feb. 25, according to the suit. The Oakley subsidiaries,
Witherspoon Associates of New Jersey and Princeton@Newport Partners
LP of Delaware, own about 300,000 Gillette shares.
   Two Coniston limited partnership subsidiaries, RB Associates of
New Jersey and Bahamas-based RB Partners, seek to solicit a
majority of Gillette's 27,000 shareholders to elect the three
Coniston principals and David Strassler to the Gillette board of
directors at the annual meeting. Shareholders can vote in person or
by proxy ballot.
   Strassler is also named as a defendant in the suit.
   The two Coniston partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares
outstanding.
   Gillette also seeks to have the shareholder proxy ballots not
certified until the suit is settled.
   Oliver vowed Coniston will fight the suit.
   ``The lawsuit is totally without merit,'' said Oliver. ``It's
clearly a last-ditch effort to win in the courts what they
apparently are not winning among stockholders. We intend to contest
it.''
   Gillette said the suit should not postpone the annual meeting in
Andover.
   In several letters sent to shareholders since March, Gillette
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman Mockler Jr. claims
Coniston plans to sell or dismember the Boston-based company.
   Gillette stock fell $3.37{ to close at $41 Thursday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

   A restriction on computerized stock trading that
went into effect when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more
than 50 points Thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually
may have worsened it, brokers said.
   The widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped
101.46 to 2,005.63, its largest loss since falling 140.58 on Jan. 8.
   It marked the second time the so-called ``collar'' on
index-arbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction
was announced in February as part of an effort to restore stability
to a market still suffering after-effects of the October market
disaster.
   It also was the first time the collar was triggered by a
downward move in the Dow average. The collar was triggered for the
first time ever on April 6, when the average rose 64.16 points.
   Under the collar rule, traders are banned from using the New
York Stock Exchange's automated order system to execute
index-arbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the Dow
average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close.
   The Big Board said the collar went into effect at about 1:55
p.m. Thursday when the average tumbled below the 50-point limit,
battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the U.S.
trade deficit, fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar.
   Although computerized program trading was halted, brokers who
utilize the strategy began using an old-fashioned manual method for
selling stocks and the Dow average kept falling.
   ``I guess there's really a lot of selling that's built up,''
said Peter DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``You can't ignore the fact that there's heavy selling
and profit-taking going on. Right now the selling is more chaotic
because people want out at the same time.''
   Others said the collar may have worsened the Dow average's drop
because after the 50-point threshhold was reached, only sellers
remained in the market.
   ``Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any
buying,'' said Joseph Barthel, a technical strategist at Butcher &
Singer Inc.
   In index arbitrage program trading, brokers use computers to buy
massive amounts of stocks in New York and the equivalent
stock-index futures in Chicago, or vice versa, in order to profit
from price disparities.
   The technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock
crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring
volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of
investors into selling.

   Travelers didn't rush to cancel flights on
Eastern or Continental airlines Thursday in response to an
unprecedented federal investigation, but travel industry people
predicted business at both lines will suffer.
   In Eastern's home base of Miami, an employee of Barry White
Travel Agent Inc. said no one had made travel changes through the
agency.
   ``We haven't had anybody cancel. Eastern is very strong in
Miami. The majority of people take Eastern,'' said the agent, who
did not give her name.
   No changes were made through Dulaney Travel Agency in Dallas
either, agent Crystal Lennon said.
   Eastern spokesman Karen Ceremsak said the airline had not seen
any drop in bookings.
   But Isabel Chalen, owner of Four Corners Travel Agency in Miami
Beach, Fla., said she foresaw problems for the airline from the
government's probe into the finances and safety of Texas Air Corp.,
parent of Eastern and Continental.
   ``Some of my customers already don't want to fly on Eastern
anymore,'' she said. ``I am pretty sure that it is not going to get
any better.''
   Indeed, Patti Engle, a traveler waiting to board an Eastern
flight in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said: ``It concerns me a lot. I
wish I knew this before it was 20 minutes before my flight.''
   And in Atlanta, Marissa Barker of Golden Jet Travel said she had
several customers change future Eastern flights to Delta Air Lines
because ``they're just really concerned that Eastern won't be
around.''
   ``I even changed my flight from Eastern to Delta this morning,''
she said. ``I'm concerned that maybe they aren't safe. I've heard
so many bad things about Eastern.''
   The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it would
investigate whether Texas Air and its management were ``fit,
willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic.
   The government has investigated small airlines and has revoked
the operating licenses of some minor carriers, but analysts said
this was the first inquiry involving major U.S. airlines.
   Texas Air's airlines together account for 20 percent of all U.S.
air traffic. Continental is the country's fourth largest airline,
while Eastern is the sixth largest.
   Financial analysts predicted that the federal inquiry, added to
the company's financial and labor headaches, could drive more
passengers away.
   ``That announcement alone is a potential problem to an airline
or airline system that can ill afford the publicity, given its
already well publicized problems _ from labor issues, to safety, to
Continental's service record,'' said Anthony Hatch of Argus
Reserach Corp.
   ``They're not getting enough people on the planes because they
have such a bad reputation, whether it's deserved or not. Add this
issue and it's hard to quantify the effect on people's decisions.
God knows what will happen if the government does indeed find they
are unfit,'' he said.
   Houston-based Texas Air had record losses of $466 million last
year and has an overall debt of around $5.4 billion.
   Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia
said recent disputes between Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo and
the unions had contributed to a loss of confidence in Eastern and
he predicted the investigation would do further damage.
   In a separate action on Wednesday, the Federal Aviation
Administration announced a civil penalty of $823,000 against
Miami-based Eastern because of ``recurring trends'' in connection
with violations of safety regulations.
   The fine was imposed just over a year after Eastern agreed to
pay a $9.5 million penalty in connection with other safety
violations.
   The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in
September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to
challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the FAA considers
valid, the fine could be reduced.
   Eastern ran full-page ads in newspapers Thursday, including the
Washington Post and the New York Times, saying it welcomed the
investigation because it will show the airline is operating safely
and has been unfairly treated by federal authorities.
   ``We're confident the outcome will be a very good one,'' Eastern
President Phil Bakes said.
   In addition to Eastern and Continental, Texas Air also owns
Rocky Mountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbour Airlines and
Provincetown-Boston Airlines.

<HEAD>Unisys Net Income Up 35 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer manufacturer Unisys Corp.
reported a 35 percent increase in net earnings for the first
quarter, citing continued savings from the summer 1986 merger of
Sperry and Burroughs.
   Net income was $149.3 million, or 72 cents per fully diluted
common share, for the three months ended March 31. For the same
period a year ago, Unisys net income was $110.2 million, or 57
cents per fully diluted common share, adjusted for a July 1987
three-for-one stock split.
   Revenue fell 2.1 percent to $2.37 billion from $2.42 billion a
year ago, when heavy end-of-the-year selling related to the old
Sperry fiscal calendar raised revenues above typical first-quarter
levels, the company reported.
   ``Our conservative business plan for 1988 and the cost
advantages that continue to accrue to us from the merger put us in
a strong position to achieve our plan in a modest business
environment,'' said Unisys President W. Michael Blumenthal.
   Unisys, created in 1986 from Burroughs Corp.'s $4.8 billion
purchase of Sperry Corp., is the world's third-largest computer
company after International Business Machines Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp.
   ``We are pleased with results for the quarter as earnings
exceeded expectations and our continued progress faster than
planned augurs well for achieving our aggressive five-year growth
goals,'' Blumenthal said.
   ``Business in the quarter was basically on target, with order
and revenue trends similar to what we experienced in 1987, when
international business was generally stronger than in the U.S.
Unisys operations continue to benefit from the fundamental
structural changes made in 1986 and 1987,'' he said.
   Unisys reports its earnings per share on a fully diluted basis _
that is, based on the number of shares that would exist if all
stock options were exercised and all convertible preferred shares
were converted into common stock. Earnings per primary common share
were up to 77 cents from 57 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Rally On Investor `Flight To Safety'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures rebounded in price Thursday, erasing the
previous two days' steep losses as investors shocked by the
widening trade deficit sought security in gold, silver and platinum.
   On other markets, stock-index and bond futures fell sharply in
response to the trade figure; energy futures advanced for the
fourth straight day; grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock
and meat futures were mostly higher.
   The Commerce Department's report that the trade deficit widened
by $1.4 billion in February to $13.8 billion prompted some
investment fund managers to sell stocks and bonds and move that
money into precious metals, which tend to hold their value in
troubled times, analysts said.
   ``We're getting some investor flight out of stocks and bonds and
into precious metals, sort of a flight to safety,'' said Bernard
Savakl, metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for June delivery moved
back above the psychologically important level of $450 a troy ounce
after settling at $449.60 on Wednesday.
   The trade figure was a bullish suprise for the metals markets,
which had sold off in recent days on expectations of a reduction in
the trade deficit to $11 billion or less, Savakl said.
   The weaker dollar and late-morning news reports of an explosion
in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa, lent further support to the
markets. South Africa is a rich source of gold and platinum, and
heightened violence there could disrupt mining of the metals.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $6.90 to $8.80 higher
with the contract for delivery in June at $456.50 a troy ounce;
silver was 12.5 cents to 14.1 cents higher with May at $6.47 a troy
ounce. Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $17.60 to
$18.30 higher with July at $540.40 a troy ounce.
   Financial futures markets registered disappointment in the trade
figure. The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
stock index fell 13.7 points to 258.40 on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The June Treasury bond contract on the Chicago Board of
Trade fell 1 9@32 points to 89.16.
   Energy futures posted solid gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange for the fourth straight day on continuing expectations
that many oil-producing countries will agree to limit production to
support prices.
   ``There's a lot of confidence coming back into the market,''
said Bob Baker, an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 31 cents
higher with May at $18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .49
cent higher with May at 49.51 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.06 cent lower to .46 cent higher with May at 52.36 cents a gallon.
   A late rally pushed grain and soybean futures to a mixed close
on the Chicago Board of Trade, possibly marking the end of a recent
sharp downturn in prices.
   Prices had fallen on Tuesday and Wednesday and continued lower
on Thursday until shortly before the closing bell, when C&D
Commodities, the largest speculative trading firm on the floor,
began buying contracts and sparked ``a spectacular closing rally,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2 cents lower with May at $3.16{ a
bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $2.04\ a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $1.61{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 5\ cents higher with May at
$6.77{ a bushel.
   Steady cash markets supported cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Hog futures were mixed on profit taking while
frozen pork bellies advanced.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .70 cent higher with April at 73.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with April at 79.47 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .15
cent higher with April at 45.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .30 cent to .42 cent higher with May at 52.07 cents a pound.

   Two brothers and a son who control the Carl's
Jr. hamburger chain were accused of using inside information to
benefit their relatives in a $2.5 million civil lawsuit brought
Thursday by federal regulators.
   Sixteen people, all but one of them members the family that
lends its name to Carl Karcher Enterprises, were named in the
insider-trading complaint filed Thursday in U.S. District Court by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Founder Carl N. Karcher, who appears in Carl's Jr. television
commercials harking back to his youth on an old-time family farm,
would be liable for $1 million in damages under the formula used in
the complaint.
   The complaint alleges that in October 1984, the insiders or
their relatives sold stock and debentures to make profits or avoid
losses when the price of shares in the publicly held company
plummeted because of an adverse quarterly report.
   ``We have to show people in these situations you don't tell your
brother, your family, your relatives,'' said Irving Einhorn, SEC
regional administrator, in announcing the filing.
   Karcher, chairman of the Anaheim-based company that has 450
outlets in the West, promised a vigorous defense.
   ``These charges are totally false,'' Karcher responded. ``My
wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell anyone
else to do so. ... To suggest that any of us would intentionally
violate the securities laws is highly offensive.''
   Carl N. Karcher and his brother, Donald F. Karcher, president
and chief operating officer, are accused of passing information to
their wives and children, but aren't accused of trading in the
stock.
   The 12 other defendants, including the founder's son, Carl Leo
Karcher, a former vice president who now is a franchise holder, and
Alvin DeShano, who still is accounting director, are accused in the
complaint of acting on the information. The rest of the defendants,
none of them company employees, are children of the elder Karcher
brothers and the childrens's spouses.
   Karcher stock closed at $15.50 per share Thursday in
over-the-counter trading, down 87{ cents from Wednesday's close.
   Those named in the complaint made profits or avoided losses
totaling $310,000, Einhorn said. The complaint seeks an injunction
``ordering them to disgorge profits derived and losses avoided.''
   It also seeks triple damages from each of those accused of
profiting. Against those accused of passing on information but not
of making trades, it seeks damages of triple the amount of any
profit allegedly made by those they tipped.
   That brings the total amount of penalties sought to $2.5 million.
   Einhorn attributed the losses to ``a downturn in profits after
the Olympics,'' which brought hundreds of thousands of visitors to
the city in the summer of 1984.
   He said alleged offenses were uncovered in random computer
checks conducted by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Einhorn said.
   Shortly thereafter, the company, which operates or franchises
450 outlets in California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, launched an
ambitious effort to expand nationwide. That effort was abandoned
two years later because of losses, and the company returned to
profitability in 1987.
   Karcher Enterprises earned $16 million on sales of $369.5
million in 1987.
   The rest of the relatives accused of profiting from the inside
information are Carl N. Karcher's son, Jerome; daughters, Barbara
Karcher-Garett, Margaret J. LeVecke, Catherine Karcher-Everly and
her husband, Daniel; and Carl N. Karcher's son-in-law, Donald E.
Fergus Jr.
   Also Donald F. Karcher's daughter, Doneta Ann Thomason and her
husband, David; and Mrs. Dorothy Karcher's sister, Rosemary Bruns,
and her husband, William.

   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more
than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday
after the government announced a $13.8 billion trade deficit in
February, the biggest since last October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to
2,005.63, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst
drop after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell $99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent,
Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica, Calif., said.
   The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was
still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the
news badly anyway.
   Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between
imports and exports would be less than $12 billion, and they bailed
out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
   ``There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so (attitude). People
wanted to see a good number,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief
economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $14
billion gap.
   The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized
program trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the first
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points.
Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points.
   The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through
Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones
nearly 11 to 1 on the NYSE.
   The trade deficit report also battered London markets, where the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent.
   The dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the
Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark in spite of heavy
intervention by virtually all the major central banks.
   Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving
trading partners an oversupply of the U.S. currency.
   The selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to
support the currency that was reaffirmed Wednesday in Washington by
finance officials of the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
West Germany, Canada and Italy.
   The Group of Seven nations failed to freeze the dollar but they
did ``let the market know they're there,'' said Marc Chandler, a
currency analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The
trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong
domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also
feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation
and hurting fixed-income securities.
   The Treasury Department's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but
still finished with a decline of roughly $11 for every $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to
roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high.
   The bond market's dismal performance was surprising because
inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets, said
Raymond Worseck, an economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis.
   The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $17.6
billion in October. It was up from January's $12.4 billion gap. But
Weinberg noted it was down from a deficit of $14.4 billion the
previous February.
   ``It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial
markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the
trade deficit,'' said James Solloway, director of economic research
at Argus Research Corp. in St. Louis.
   Solloway said traders had become the victims of expecting too
much and then not getting it.
   ``We just can't too far ahead of ourselves. We all would like to
see faster improvement, but it may be expecting too much,'' he said.
   For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an
annual rate of $157.6 billion, below the record $171.2 billion of
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $156.2
billion in 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   Exports rose to $23.6 billion, up 5.5 percent from $22.3 billion
in January and up 22 percent from $19.4 billion in February 1987.
   Imports rose to $37.4 billion, up 7.5 percent from $34.8 billion
in January and up 10.9 percent from $33.7 billion in February 1987.
   The deficit with Japan, the country with the largest trade
surplus with the United States, also increased dramatically, by
$500 million to more than $4.5 billion.
   But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized
countries _ Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea _ falling
by about $20 million to $2.9 billion.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, who is in Moscow, said in
a statement released by his office that the February figures were
disappointing despite what he called an ``underlying favorable
trend.''
   ``The figures show a substantial improvement from the average
$15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,''
Verity said. ``We look forward to continued export-led growth.''
   In another report Thursday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories grew 0.1 percent in February, a small rise
after four big monthly increases. A healthy rise in sales kept
inventories from rising.
   Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But the
inventory numbers, along with the trade report showing a big
increase in imports, provide evidence that domestic demand has not
weakened.

   A restriction on computerized stock trading that
went into effect when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more
than 50 points Thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually
may have worsened it, brokers said.
   The widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped
101.46 to 2,005.64, its largest loss since falling 140.58 on Jan. 8.
   It marked the second time the so-called ``collar'' on
index-arbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction
was announced in February as part of an effort to restore stability
to a market still suffering after-effects of the October market
disaster.
   It also was the first time the collar was triggered by a
downward move in the Dow average. The collar was triggered for the
first time ever on April 6, when the average rose 64.16 points.
   Under the collar rule, traders are banned from using the New
York Stock Exchange's automated order system to execute
index-arbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the Dow
average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close.
   The Big Board said the collar went into effect at about 1:55
p.m. Thursday when the average tumbled below the 50-point limit,
battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the U.S.
trade deficit, fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar.
   Although computerized program trading was halted, brokers who
utilize the strategy began using an old-fashioned manual method for
selling stocks and the Dow average kept falling.
   ``I guess there's really a lot of selling that's built up,''
said Peter DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``You can't ignore the fact that there's heavy selling
and profit-taking going on. Right now the selling is more chaotic
because people want out at the same time.''
   Others said the collar may have worsened the Dow average's drop
because after the 50-point threshhold was reached, only sellers
remained in the market.
   ``Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any
buying,'' said Joseph Barthel, a technical strategist at Butcher &
Singer Inc.
   In index arbitrage program trading, brokers use computers to buy
massive amounts of stocks in New York and the equivalent
stock-index futures in Chicago, or vice versa, in order to profit
from price disparities.
   The technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock
crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring
volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of
investors into selling.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall On Trade Deficit Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished broadly lower Thursday,
dropping sharply on news of an unexpected widening in the nation's
trade deficit but recovering some lost ground later in the day as
stock prices plunged.
   Long-term yields moved higher, but some short-term interest
rates fell as investors worried by the steep stock market decline
sought the relative safety of Treasury issues.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond ended the day down a full point, or
$10 for every $1,000 in face value. The issue, viewed as a
bellwether for the credit markets, careened 2 points lower shortly
after the trade report was released.
   The 30-year bond's yield rose to 8.86 percent from 8.73 percent
late Wednesday.
   But some short-term rates fell. Yields on three-month Treasury
bills, for instance, slid to 5.72 percent from 5.83 percent late
Wednesday.
   Bond prices skidded immediately after the Commerce Department
reported the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.8 billion in
February, its biggest shortfall since October. Most analysts
expected the gap to narrow.
   A wider deficit suggests that the dollar may have to fall
further to reduce the trade gap. A falling dollar makes
dollar-denominated securities less attractive to foreign investors,
who have been major buyers of Treasury bonds.
   ``The bond market was in a state of shock when the number
printed,'' said Elliott Platt, research director for the investment
firm Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Inc.
   But later in the day, bond prices retraced some lost ground as
stock prices fell. Platt said as the stock market's decline
deepened, some traders decided to buy bonds where yields were
becoming more attractive compared with stocks.
   The Dow Jones industrial average wound up down 101.46 points.
   Platt said yields on three-month Treasury bills fell because
demand surged for the government-backed instruments, which are
viewed as secure and can be easily converted into cash. The
phenomenon, known as a ``flight to quality,'' often occurs in times
of financial uncertainty.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
issues fell \ point, intermediates slipped by between \ point and {
point and 20-year governments dropped 1] points, according to the
financial information service Telerate Inc.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.46 to 111.30. The Shearson Lehman composite
index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 6.21 to 1,162.82.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, slid 2.52 to to 279.88.
   Yields on six-month Treasury bills fell 2 basis points to 6.02
percent, but one-year bills rose 4 basis points to 6.46 percent. A
basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 611-16 percent, up from 6| percent late
Wednesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index
that measures prices on 40 long-term bonds fell 25-32 point to 87
29-32 while its yield rose to 8.17 percent from 8.09 percent.

   Unexpected news of an increase in the nation's
trade deficit touched off a freefall slide in the stock market
Thursday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average with its second
three-digit loss this year.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips plunged 101.46 to 2,005.64,
for its largest loss since it fell 140.58 on Jan. 8 and its fifth
biggest point drop ever.
   Declining issues overpowered advances by about 11 to 1 in the
overall tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 144 up, 1,601
down and 248 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 211.81 million shares, against 185.12
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index fell
6.06 to 147.14.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February
from $12.44 billion the month before.
   That came as a shock to market participants, who had been
looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and
exports.
   The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the
news, and U.S. credit markets also took the news badly.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell more than $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8.9 percent
range. Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as
about 8.3 percent.
   Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in
particular, raised fears that the Federal Reserve might soon feel
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to
support the dollar.
   ``You got a nasty bit of news,'' said Larry Wachtel at
Prudential-Bache Securities. ``The market is saying that the
economy is too strong.''
   The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon,
activating for the second-time the ``collar'' set up by the New
York Stock Exchange in early February. At that point the exchange
asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading
system for program trading.
   But prices kept falling. Analysts noted that the Dow had climbed
nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on
anticipation of favorable trade news. This morning's report, they
said, effectively wiped out the basis for that rally.
   Multipoint losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 7|
at 159|; International Business Machines, down 4} at 111];
Coca-Cola, down 2\ at 37}; Procter & Gamble, down 4~ at 77~, and
General Motors, down 3} at 71|.
   Digital Equipment, which reported approximately flat
first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, lost 5\ to 103[.
   One of the few issues that bucked the downtrend was Resorts
International class A shares, up 3[ at 31] in American Stock
Exchange trading. Donald Trump and Merv Griffin, who have been
battling for control of the company, reached an agreement that
would ultimately give holders other than Trump $36 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $99.69 billion, or 3.70
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 247.33 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 14.17 to 302.34,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 11.82 at 259.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 8.89 to 374.52. At the Amex, the market value index closed
at 298.92, down 6.87.

<HEAD>PR Execs Say Speakes' Phony Reagan Quotes Damage the Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public relations professionals are concerned
that former White House spokesman Larry Speakes may have damaged
the credibility of their business by admitting he concocted quotes
for President Reagan.
   ``You never make up a quote for anybody,'' said Howard J.
Rubenstein, president of a large New York-based firm that bears his
name. ``If one of my account executives did something like this,
I'd really chew him or her out.''
   Other public relations executives queried by telephone Wednesday
agreed with Rubenstein's assessment of Speakes' quote concoctions,
which were disclosed in a book Speakes wrote about his tenure at
the White House.
   However, none was willing to say Speakes should quit his
position as head of communications at the Wall Street investment
giant Merrill Lynch & Co. A few said they expected the entire
episode to fade quickly from public interest.
   Some sources, speaking on the condition they not be identified,
suggested it was possible Speakes could face sanctions by the
Public Relations Society of America for violation of its code of
ethics.
   Article 7 of the code states: ``A member shall not intentionally
communicate false or misleading information and is obligated to use
care to avoid communication of false or misleading information.''
   But Speakes did not become a society member until November, well
after his departure from the White House. The society's national
secretary, Isobel Parke, said the group's attorneys believed the
code covers the actions of members only while they are members.
   ``It is written in the present tense. It does not refer to
actions that members may or may not have done before they joined,''
she said.
   Ethics-code violators face penalties ranging from warnings to
expulsion from the 13,000-member society.
   Ms. Parke would not comment specifically on Speakes' disclosures
or speculate on whether his credibility had been damaged. But she
said that ``if any individual deliberately fabricates quotations it
will indeed damage his trustworthiness, particularly with the
press.''
   Asked if his disclosures have damaged the public relations
industry, she said: ``It doesn't help. Of course it doesn't help.''
   Merrill Lynch spokesman William Clark said there was no change
in Speakes' status at the company, and Clark rejected a suggestion
that Merrill Lynch's own credibility may have been hurt.
   ``The events portrayed in the book had nothing to do with
Merrill Lynch,'' Clark said.
   Speakes said Tuesday that he had told Reagan about the quotes
and the president never objected. But Reagan said Wednesday he was
not aware until recent days that Speakes had attributed statements
to him he didn't make.
   ``In the 34 years I've represented controversial and prominent
people, I've never taken it upon myself to make up a quote,''
Rubenstein said. ``I think that goes well beyond reason and creates
a false impression that public relations people are manipulative
and can't be trusted.''
   Speakes was criticized by many other public relations
executives, from the biggest international firms to the one-office
operations.
   ``The bottom line is credibility,'' said Anthony R. Katz, senior
vice president of D-A-Y Ogilvy & Mather, one of the world's largest
public relations concerns. ``The role of the PR person is to
communicate, to advance a person's point of view responsibly ...
The president's cause was not advanced.''
   Vivian Manuel, president of VM Communications Inc., a small New
York-based public relations agency, said: ``I think when you say
somebody said something, they should have said it.''
   Nevertheless, a few said they could understand how Speakes may
have likened the concocted quotes to the job of a speechwriter who
is sensitive to a client's time pressure and intimately familiar
with how a client thinks.
   ``If he was making up quotes that in effect made up public
policy, I'd be a lot more concerned,'' said Ernest J. DiRico, chief
operating officer of Fleishman and DiRico Public Relations in
Atlanta.
   ``But I think in a lot of cases, whether it's a business
executive or public official, they employ a PR person to act as
official spokesperson,'' he said. ``They assume the PR person would
have the good sense to know where the boundaries are. If you step
over the boundaries, you get fired.''

<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more
than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday
after the government announced a $13.8 billion trade deficit in
February, the biggest since last October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to
2,005.64, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst
drop after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8.
   The value of U.S. stocks fell $99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent,
Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica, Calif., said.
   The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was
still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the
news badly anyway.
   Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between
imports and exports would be less than $12 billion, and they bailed
out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
   ``There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so (attitude). People
wanted to see a good number,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief
economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $14
billion gap.
   The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized
program trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the first
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points.
Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points.
   The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through
Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones
nearly 11 to 1 on the NYSE.
   The trade deficit report also battered London markets, where the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent.
   The dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the
Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark in spite of heavy
intervention by virtually all the major central banks.
   Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving
trading partners an oversupply of the U.S. currency.
   The selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to
support the currency that was reaffirmed Wednesday in Washington by
finance officials of the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
West Germany, Canada and Italy.
   The Group of Seven nations failed to freeze the dollar but they
did ``let the market know they're there,'' said Marc Chandler, a
currency analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The
trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong
domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also
feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation
and hurting fixed-income securities.
   The Treasury Department's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but
still finished with a decline of roughly $11 for every $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to
roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high.
   The bond market's dismal performance was surprising because
inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets, said
Raymond Worseck, an economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis.
   The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $17.6
billion in October. It was up from January's $12.4 billion gap. But
Weinberg noted it was down from a deficit of $14.4 billion the
previous February.
   ``It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial
markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the
trade deficit,'' said James Solloway, director of economic research
at Argus Research Corp. in St. Louis.
   Solloway said traders had become the victims of expecting too
much and then not getting it.
   ``We just can't too far ahead of ourselves. We all would like to
see faster improvement, but it may be expecting too much,'' he said.
   For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an
annual rate of $157.6 billion, below the record $171.2 billion of
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $156.2
billion in 1986, the Commerce Department said.
   Exports rose to $23.6 billion, up 5.5 percent from $22.3 billion
in January and up 22 percent from $19.4 billion in February 1987.
   Imports rose to $37.4 billion, up 7.5 percent from $34.8 billion
in January and up 10.9 percent from $33.7 billion in February 1987.
   The deficit with Japan, the country with the largest trade
surplus with the United States, also increased dramatically, by
$500 million to more than $4.5 billion.
   But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized
countries _ Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea _ falling
by about $20 million to $2.9 billion.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, who is in Moscow, said in
a statement released by his office that the February figures were
disappointing despite what he called an ``underlying favorable
trend.''
   ``The figures show a substantial improvement from the average
$15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,''
Verity said. ``We look forward to continued export-led growth.''
   In another report Thursday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories grew 0.1 percent in February, a small rise
after four big monthly increases. A healthy rise in sales kept
inventories from rising.
   Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But the
inventory numbers, along with the trade report showing a big
increase in imports, provide evidence that domestic demand has not
weakened.

   Reeling from setbacks in Congress, the courts, and
at the cash register, Eastern Airlines faces new problems with
federal government investigations under way.
   But the airline's president says he welcomes a major federal
investigation into the management of its parent Texas Air Corp. as
a way to highlight his company's performance.
   The Department of Transportation launched an unprecedented
inquiry Wednesday into Texas Air's finances and management, to
determine whether the company is fit to carry commercial air
traffic.
   The Federal Aviation Administration also on Wednesday slapped
Eastern with $823,000 in new fines for safety violations and said
it was beginning an inspection of the carrier's entire fleet.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the DOT probe ``certainly
isn't going to help'' Eastern's financial troubles, which include
the loss of $900 million over the past 10 years. Eastern also
reported a nearly 20 percent drop in passenger revenue during March.
   ``The very idea of an investigation into safety is scary to the
flying public, but we welcome it because we hope the whole story of
Eastern Airlines dedication to safety and performance will finally
be told,'' Bakes said.
   Bakes blamed the labor unions at Eastern, which was near
bankruptcy when Texas Air acquired it in 1986, for political
agitation that he said brought on the government's scrutiny of the
company.
   ``We hope this (investigation) means an end to the
behind-the-scenes lobbying and media manipulation by the unions and
the end of the scare tactics,'' Bakes said.
   Charles Bryan, the leader of Eastern's Machinists union, said
Washington was expressing its own concern over the management of
Eastern and would not have acted so decisively simply because of
complaints from labor unions.
   ``What we have right now at Eastern Airlines and the Texas Air
empire is dealmakers and lobbyists running the airline,'' said
Bryan, president of the Machinists District 100, which represents
12,000 of Eastern's 32,000 employees.
   Eastern pilots, flight attendants and mechanics contend Texas
Air management has sacrificed safety and intimidated employees in
order to cut costs at Eastern, where Bakes wants to reduce labor
costs by nearly 30 percent.
   Eastern's unions bitterly have opposed Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo's plans for trimming costs and restructuring the airline,
including the spinoff of its profitable Northeast corridor shuttle.
   On Wednesday, a new union lawsuit accused Eastern of violating a
labor contract by using company planes to train non-union flight
attendants to serve passengers in the event of a strike.
   The Transport Workers Union of America, Local 553, charged
Eastern planes are being used by Orion Lift Services Inc., an
independent cargo airline, to train non-union flight attendants.
   Eastern also faces troubles from Congress and federal
authorities.
   In recent weeks, more than 150 congressmen have expressed
support for a closer examination of Texas Air management practices
and held hearings over the issue.
   Federal judges last month blocked Eastern from spinning off its
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle into a Texas Air subsidiary and
also from using Eastern planes to train Orion Air personnel.
Eastern had lined up the North Carolina-based cargo carrier to fly
its routes in case of an employee strike.
   The $823,000 civil penalty imposed Wednesday against Eastern
comes 14 months after Eastern agreed to pay $9.5 million in
penalties because of earlier safety infractions. FAA officials said
the latest fine stems from record keeping and maintenance
infractions similar to those found in the earlier action.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday approved a $1.1
trillion budget that calls for bypassing last fall's
deficit-reduction pact with President Reagan to expand the war on
drugs.
   The fiscal 1989 spending blueprint, passed 69-26, also includes
increases for education, the space program and AIDS research while
freezing or cutting back transportation, housing and development
grants to local governments.
   ``We made tough choices,'' said Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.,
chairman of the Budget Committee. He defended his plan while
conceding that the deficit problem remains unsolved. ``We can't
keep consuming more than we earn and living on credit,'' he said.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., called the budget a ``lost
opportunity'' that resulted from ``a decision to coast rather than
deal with the deficit'' in an election year.
   ``The next president and the next Congress will be left with
enormous problems,'' he said.
   The House approved a different version of the spending plan last
month. The two chambers will begin negotiations next week toward a
final budget resolution.
   Conforming with last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with the
president, the Senate plan earmarks $294 billion for military
spending and $16.1 billion for international assistance. It
includes no new taxes beyond the $14 billion enacted last December
for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   The agreement also capped spending by domestic agencies. The
House plan, like Reagan's proposed budget, conformed with those
limits.
   But the Senate voted 93-0 Wednesday night to bypass the spending
caps to provide an additional $2.6 billion for anti-drug efforts
beginning next year. The money would go for treatment programs, law
enforcement and interdiction of smuggled drugs.
   The amendment offered by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called for increasing government tax and
debt collections to cover the $1.4 billion portion of this new
money that would be spent during the 1989 fiscal year.
   Sponsors said they weren't busting the deficit agreement,
because that pact includes a clause allowing exceptions for dire
emergencies.
   The Senate budget claims to reduce the deficit to $136 billion,
as required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. Like the
House, the Senate adopted the administration's optimistic economic
scenarios in order to show less red ink.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit would be
$35 billion higher. The deficit was $150 billion in fiscal 1987,
and it is expected to dip to $147.5 billion this year.
   Overall, the Senate budget would cut the deficit $7.2 billion
below what would otherwise be expected under current law, according
to budget committee figures. Less than half of those savings would
come from spending cuts, with the bulk relying mostly on sales of
government assets to show a deficit reduction.
   The DeConcini-D'Amato drug amendment and a smaller one, also
shifting more money to drugs, were the only two substantive
amendments adopted by the Senate in four days of debate.
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 57-38, a proposal by Sen.
Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., to postpone starting construction of the
superconducting super collider research project until after next
year, and using the $50 million saved for health care.
   Senators also defeated, 66-29, an amendment by Sen. Bill
Armstrong, R-Colo., to cut development programs to pay for a
reduction in the capital gains tax.
   Like Reagan's budget, the Senate plan greatly increases space
and science spending. The space program would get a 27 percent
increase and the National Science Foundation 11 percent more than
during the current fiscal year.
   AIDS research would get more than $1.3 billion.
   ``This is one of the most futuristic budgets in the history of
the United States,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the
senior Republican on the budget committee.
   The Senate plan also boosts aviation safety programs by 19
percent, to allow for hiring of more air traffic controllers and
purchase of new equipment.
   The House approved a more modest boost in the space program,
opting instead to protect housing, development and transportation
programs from cutbacks.
   Neither plan contemplates major changes in agriculture programs.
The Senate version includes $500 million for buying commodities to
continue the distributions to the needy.
   The Senate budget adopts Reagan's proposal to increase military
pay by 4.3 percent but civilian federal salaries by only 2 percent.
The House opted for a 3 percent pay hike for all federal employees.
   The Senate budget action came on the earliest date in years, but
Congress was still missing its April 15 deadline for finishing
budget action.
   The budget is a congressional resolution that does not require
the president's signature. It serves as a guideline for Congress as
it produces its annual spending bills.

the income tax filing deadline:

<HEAD>TAX FREEDOM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The ``average'' American will have to work 126 days this year _
two more than in 1987 _ just to pay federal, state and local taxes,
the Tax Foundation said. ``Tax Freedom Day'' will fall on May 5,
the latest ever.

   Some House Republicans used the tax-filing deadline to launch an
offensive to block income-tax increases.
   The congressmen want: no tax rate increases or further cuts in
deductions unless accompanied by rate reductions; a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution; and a ``taxpayer bill of rights''
that seeks to protect citizens dealing with the IRS.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAX PENALTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The IRS offered taxpayers tips on avoiding penalties for
following erroneous advice given by is own information service.
   The IRS said it will consider the specifics of the telephone
assistance call and whether the taxpayer tried to get the correct
answer from tax forms, instructions or official publications.
   The agency indicated the taxpayer's case would be helped if he
or she noted the name of the employee who gave the bad advice and
the date and time of the call.

<HEAD>ROSTENKOWSKI-TAX MAIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aides to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee, say he has been flooded with more
than 2,000 letters from angry, befuddled taxpayers lambasting tax
changes.
   ``Simplification of the tax code must have been a joke. There is
nothing that has been simplified,'' said one of the letters.
   The staff said most of the letters are part of a write-in
campaign by Money magazine and contain copies of an article, ``Nine
Tax Laws Congress Should Repeal Tomorrow.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAX NIGHT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In many towns, post offices will send clerks to curbside to
collect tax forms for last minute taxpayers.
   Local broadcasters and others have helped turn tax night into an
``event'' with promotions including coffee, doughnut, and aspirin
giveaways. One radio station will offer taxpayers a chance to vent
their feelings by taking a sledgehammer to a used car when they
drop off their returns. A small charge for taking part will be used
for charity.

<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of domestic cars and light trucks fell 10.8
percent in early April from a year ago, a drop that analysts labled
a statistical blip and that some industry participants blamed on
unique holiday and tax factors.
   Automakers reported Wednesday they sold 230,486 domestic-built
cars and light trucks in the eight selling days of April 1-10, down
from 290,826 domestic vehicles in the nine selling days of the same
period a year earlier. Because of the difference in selling days,
percentage changes for the period reflect changes in average daily
sales, not straight totals.
   ``It's just the usual (market) volatility, nothing special.
There's no question sales will pick up,'' said Ronald Glantz,
analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Glantz and others said increased difficulty and confusion among
people preparing this year's revised federal income tax forms may
have kept more buyers than usual out of the market in early April
as the April 15 filing date neared.
   Adam Lee, sales manager of Lee Hyundai in Portland, Maine, said:
``The last two weeks have been slow. You see people waiting to
finish their tax returns ...to see how much they can afford.''
   The April 1-10 period also included Good Friday, Passover and
Easter, a time when many people take extra days off work but aren't
likely to wander into dealerships, analysts said.
   Sales were unexpectedly strong during the first quarter of 1988,
leading many analysts to increase their forecasts for the rest of
the year. Early April marked the first real slowdown.
   ``It's the weakest period in a long time. (But) I think it's
just a hiccup,'' said David Healy, industry analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert in New York.
   ``The pressure on dealers to move out excess inventory is
lightening up. Inventories were on the low side of normal at the
end of March,'' he said.
   Dealerships had a 58-day supply of domestic cars at the end of
March, according to the weekly trade publication Ward's Automotive
Reports. A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal.
   Car sales dropped in early April for all domestic producers
except Honda Motor Co., whose sales jumped 31.7 percent, and Mazda
Motor Corp., which began assembling cars in the United States late
last year.
   Chrysler Corp., the third-largest U.S. automaker, saw its car
sales drop 7.8 percent from last year but saw its U.S. market share
rise to 15.6 percent from 14.3 percent a year earlier.
   Chrysler truck sales jumped 15.3 percent as its market share
rose to 23.9 percent from 20.4 percent a year ago.
   Of the Big Three, General Motors Corp. suffered the largest drop
in domestic car sales, 18.8 percent from a year ago, compared to a
15.9 percent drop for Ford Motor Co.
   GM held 49.2 percent of that market, down from 51.2 percent a
year ago, while Ford's share held steady at 29.7 percent.
   Ford's domestic light truck sales fell 12.7 percent and its
share of the market shrank to 35.1 percent from 39.6 percent. GM's
truck sales rose 0.8 percent and its market share rose to 39.3
percent from 38.4 percent a year ago.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended April 4, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $4.6 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $2,982.7 billion in the week ended April 4 from
$2,978.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,751.7 billion from $3,745.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $3.2 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $765 billion from a revised $768.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $761.2 billion, a 4.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.76 billion in
the week ended April 6, compared with an increase of $456 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings from the
Federal Reserve System averaged $167 million a day in the week
ended Wednesday, down from $426 million the previous week.

<HEAD>Texas Raises Possibility of Cooperating With OPEC on Oil Prices</HEAD>

   A suggestion that Texas may cut production and
cooperate with OPEC to shore up oil prices raises serious antitrust
questions and would not be in the country's best interests, oil
analysts and Reagan administration officials said Thursday.
   ``You can imagine what the Reagan administration thinks about
it,'' said a State Department official who spoke only on condition
of anonymity. ``It's a cartel that does not operate in U.S.
interests.''
   Doug Elmets, press aide to Energy Secretary John Herrington,
said, ``It's the department's belief and the government's policy
that assistance to OPEC in its effort to manipulate the price of
oil is not the correct approach.''
   Kent Hance, one of three members of the Texas Railroad
Commission, met earlier this month with Rilwanu Lukman, the
president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and
discussed the possibility that his state and the cartel would
cooperate.
   AP-Dow Jones asked Lukman last week whether the cooperation
might be in the nature of an information exchange or production
cuts. He replied, ``Exchanging information isn't going to do the
trick is it?''
   Hance told Harte-Hanks newspapers Tuesday that he would attend
the cartel's April 23 meeting in Vienna. ``I think that (cutting
Texas production) is one of the things that has to be considered,''
he said. ``It would be one of the items we would discuss.''
   Interviewed from Austin on Thursday, Hance said ``We have the
right ... to set our production allowables. We can do it to prevent
waste.''
   ``We are not trying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just want
input. ... our goal is one of stability,'' he said.
   Hance said he wouldn't make any deals without the approval of
his colleagues and Gov. Bill Clements, who have told him to go
ahead with the trip.
   Some industry analysts expressed doubts about the wisdom of such
an action, while others questioned its legality.
   ``It is probably a violation of the antitrust laws,'' said John
Lamont, oil specialist in the Washington law firm of Lobel, Novins,
Lamont & Flug.
   However, William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division of
the Justice Department early in the Reagan administration, said,
``It is fairly standard doctrine that the antitrust laws apply only
to private activity,'' not action by a state.
   Hance's efforts pose ``a very interesting question. The economic
evil that results is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are
aimed against,'' Baxter said in an interview from the Stanford
University Law School in Palo Alto, Calif., where he is a professor.
   Mark Sheehan, spokesman for the antitrust division, declined
immediate comment.
   Ed Rothschild, assistant director of the Consumer-Labor Energy
Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington, said it was ``a joke''
to think Texas can help OPEC be any more effective in holding up
prices than it has been in recent years.
   But, he said, ``It would be tantamount to criminal activity if
anyone in the private sector did it.''
   Texas is the nation's No. 1 oil producer. Statistics for 1986,
the most recent that break down production by state, show output of
2.3 million barrels from 201,000 wells _ a quarter of the nation's
production and a third of its wells.
   Since 1972, the Texas Railroad Commission has set allowable
production quotas at 100 percent of capacity. It was these quotas
that had permitted Texas to serve the role of ``swing producer'' in
world oil markets before the rise of OPEC in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Texas was hit hard by the oil price collapse of 1986 engineered
by OPEC's leading producer, Saudi Arabia. The state lost 8,000
wells during that year. The average price at the well plunged from
$26.80 per barrel in 1985 to $14.74 in 1986, cutting the aggregate
wellhead value of the state's crude production from $24 billion to
$12 billion.
   Prices have recovered from their lows of 1986, but never have
approached the 1985 price.
   OPEC's recent conversations with non-member nations, and the
prospect of their cooperation, kicked up typical prices this week
by about $1 a barrel to a bit more than $18 a barrel, which is
OPEC's benchmark price.
   ``We can't bury our heads in the sand anymore and hope things
get better,'' Hance said, adding that he would not take part in the
formal OPEC sessions but would ``meet with some of the OEPC
ministers'' separately.
   Arnold Safer, president of Energy Futures Group Inc., a
Washington consulting firm, said a likely cutback would be about
70,000 barrels a day _ an amount he said could be made up quickly
by other sources.
   ``You could probably squeeze that much out of other (U.S.)
states,'' he said.
   ``The politics of the day may not be in Texas' interest. The
federal government might not like it. In the consuming states,
obviously, reaction wouldn't be favorable to getting in bed with
OPEC,'' Safer added.
