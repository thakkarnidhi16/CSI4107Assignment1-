<HEAD>Columnist To Face Weapons Possession Charges, Newspaper Says</HEAD>

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan will face
weapons possession charges after shooting a teen-ager who had taken
an unauthorized predawn dip in Rowan's backyard swimming pool, The
Washington Post reported Thursday night.
   The Post said in its Friday editions that Rowan was charged with
possession of an unregistered handgun and unregistered ammunition
in District of Columbia Superior Court on Wednesday.
   Mary Layton, director of communications for the D.C. government,
told The Associated Press that officials refused to comment on the
the case until Friday, when a statement will be issued.
   Rowan, 62, was cleared of assault charges in the case on June 23
after an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said at the time that he believed
Rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun.
But Stephens deferred that decision to the city, which normally
decides whether to prosecute such cases.
   Rowan, who has frequently written columns calling for strict
restrictions on handgun use, was out of town and unavailable for
comment.
   His wife, Vivian, said the couple had no knowledge of the
charges against Rowan.
   The Post said it had been told by Beverly Burke, a spokeswoman
for the D.C. office of corporation counsel, which under local law
has the authority to prosecute cases involving unregistered
firearms, that Rowan was charged on Wednesday.
   The shooting renewed debate on handgun restrictions, as pro-gun
groups accused Rowan of hypocrisy for owning a gun after publicly
opposing the practice. Rowan said he obtained the weapon after
receiving death threats.
   If convicted on the charges, the columnist faces a maximum
penalty of two years in jail and a $2,000 fine in connection with
the June 14 incident at his northwest Washington home.
   The District of Columbia's 1976 handgun ordinance requires that
all weapons be registered, but Rowan told authorities that the gun
had belonged to his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent. Rowan
claimed that his son was told he did not have to register the
weapon after leaving the FBI.
   Rowan told authorities that he shot Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy
Chase, Md., after hearing noises in his back yard, calling police
and discovering Smith and three other youths by his pool.
   Rowan said he shot Smith after the teen-ager lunged at him.
Smith disputed that, saying he did not threaten the columnist and
was shot while trying to flee.
   Smith, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released
the same day from Georgetown University Hospital. He and and a
companion were each charged with one count of unlawful entry
stemming from their foray onto Rowan's property, but prosecutors
dropped the misdemeanor charges in exchange for 40 hours of
community service work from both.

   A man robbed a tourist at gunpoint on crowded
Fifth Avenue outside St. Patrick's Cathedral, then was shot and
killed Wednesday when he tried to escape in a car driven by an
off-duty correction officer, police said.
   During a struggle inside the car, the correction officer fired
his gun, striking the robbery suspect three times in the chest,
said a police spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   The suspect, Angel Santiago, 22, of Queens died later in the
afternoon at Bellevue Hospital, Howard said.
   The correction officer, John Bonilla, 33, also shot himself in
the foot during the struggle and was in stable condition at
Bellevue, Howard said.
   Santiago fired no shots, but police recovered a revolver,
believed to be Santiago's, that contained five live rounds, Howard
said.
   Bonilla's 5-year-old son, also named John, was in the car at the
time of the 5 p.m. shooting but was not injured, Howard said.
   A second robbery suspect was still at large, Howard said.
   Joe Ashcraft of Muncie, Ind., said he was visiting midtown
Manhattan with his family, standing on the sidewalk photographing
the historic Roman Catholic cathedral, when two men pulled up in a
car and one got out and demanded his video camera.
   ``He said if you don't give me your camera and take it over and
put it in that car right now I'm going to shoot you. At that point
I didn't believe he had a gun,'' said Ashcraft.
   ``But then he pulled the gun and when he pulled the gun I gave
him the camera,'' Ashcraft said.
   As the robbers tried to speed off, their car collided with a
taxi and then slammed into the side of a bus. The pair then jumped
out of their car and fled on foot before Santiago got into
Bonilla's car, police said.
   The gun used by Bonilla was his personal revolver, which he was
authorized to carry, Howard said.
   Ashcraft recovered his video camera from the robbery suspects'
car, where they had left it behind when they fled, Howard said.
   ``We've been riding the subways every place we go and not had a
fear in the world,'' said Ashcraft, who was with his wife, their
6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son and Mrs. Ashcraft's uncle.
Now, he said, ``I'm a little afraid.''
   But he said he wouldn't consider New York City ``a bad place.
It's just one incident.''

   George Bush stepped up his search for a vice presidential
running mate Wednesday, inviting former rival Jack Kemp and other
prominent Republicans o submit detailed background information.
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis burnished his law-and-order
credentials.
   Several other Republicans who figure prominently in vice
presidential speculation have not yet received questionnaires from
Bush, according to their spokesmen.
   Bush, who has about three weeks left to pick a running mate for
the fall campaign, also disclosed plans to testify before the
Republican platform committee when it meets the week before the
party's convention in New Orleans early next month.
   Republican sources said a request for background information had
gone out to Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico as well as to Kemp.
And New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said he had received a
questionnaire from Bush campaign officials.
   An aide for Kemp said the congressman met with Robert Kimmitt, a
Washington attorney who is helping the Bush campaign filter
possible running mates. The aide, Marci Robinson, said the New York
congressman would return the material to the Bush campaign within a
week.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
lambasted the Republican for opposing the Equal Rights Amendment
and other women's concerns.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they ripped
it out of the (Republican) platform,'' he told the National
Federation of Business and Professional Women meeting in
Albuquerque, N.M.. He said that despite Bush's call last week for
tax credits for day care, the administration fought `'every step of
the way'' against a $50 million spending proposal with the same
goal.
   Dukakis, boosted by his own party's convention, drew his biggest
lead of the presidential campaign _ 18 points over Bush _ in the
latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll.
   Dukakis spent his day in Boston, ostensibly tending to
Massachusetts statehouse duties but staging a bill-signing ceremony
for legislation to add about 1,000 beds to state prisons and to
restore child pornography legislation that was struck down by the
state Supreme Court.
   He also announced distribution of $7.8 million in state and
federal grants to assist the victims of crime, and said his state
is a national leader in ``increasing sensitivity and awareness of
what it is like to be a victim of crime.'' Dukakis also cited a 13
percent drop in crime in his state in the past four years.
   Dukakis' public events during the day seemed designed to counter
the Republican charge that he is soft on crime, particularly in
view of his one-time support for a prison furlough program that
permitted some first-degree murderers to receive passes. One such
prisoner raped a Maryland woman while on furlough.
   Dukakis also signed a $124 million spending plan to close the
books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. The money was largely
for underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid to
Families with Dependent Children.
   Aides to Bush, meanwhile, have said he is conducting polling in
several key states to gauge the impact of several potential running
mates. In addition to Kemp, the names mentioned most frequently in
the speculation include Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and
California Gov. George Deukmejian. Several women's names also crop
up periodically, including Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and
Dole's wife, Elizabeth, a former secretary of Transportation.
   Aides to Sen. Dole, Deukmejian, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Sens. Richard Lugar of
Indiana and Alan Simpson of Wyoming all said they had not received
questionnaires.
   Bush campaign officials declined to say how seriously candidates
such as Sununu and Domenici were being taken, although there was
speculation that at least some names were being made public to mask
the true deliberations as well as to give the officials involved
additional stature in their states.
   One man not mentioned in the speculation, Sen. Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire, held a news conference in Washington to announce
an effort designed to pressure Bush into picking a conservative
running mate.
   Humphrey said the Coalition for a Winning Ticket would not be a
``stalking horse for any one candidate'' but a ``rallying point for
conservatives who hope to persuade the vice president to choose
someone from the conservative majority wing of the party.''
   As for Bush, campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the vice
president would travel to the convention city of New Orleans on
Aug. 8 to address the platform committee and ``put his stamp of
approval on the platform.'' The vice president isn't expected to
return until Aug. 17, the day he is formally nominated as the
party's candidate for president.
   In other developments, the Republican National Committee
disclosed it is conducting a multi-million dollar advertising
campaign leading up to the convention.
   The three, 30-second commercials do not mention Bush by name,
but tout ``seven years of jobs, peace and economic growth brought
to you by the Republicans.''
   One commercial evokes images of the high inflation and long gas
lines of Jimmy Carter's presidency as the announcer says, ``The
Republicans have worked very hard to make sure you'll never have to
see it again.''
   In the latest poll _ a telephone survey of 1,770 registered
voters conducted Saturday through Monday _ Dukakis received 50
percent support to 32 percent for Bush. Dukakis had led by 10
points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll.
   Other recent surveys have found a jump in Dukakis' support,
common for presidential nominees following their party conventions.
Two Gallup polls done after the convention had Dukakis ahead by 17
points, and he led by 10 points in one poll and by 12 in another
conducted during the convention.
   The latest poll found women providing a major component of
Dukakis' support, a continuation of the ``gender gap'' suffered by
Bush. Dukakis led by 30 points among women, 54-24, compared to a
six-point lead among men.
   The survey had a margin of error of three points.
   Among the Democrats, an aide to Jesse Jackson said the runner-up
to Dukakis in the primary campaign is ``fired up'' and ready to
begin active campaigning for the party's ticket. A spokesman at the
Secret Service said Jackson would continue to receive security
protection while a decision is made on whether to grant protection
for the entire fall campaign.
   In Chicago, Jackson met briefly Wednesday with Democratic
National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk to discuss Jackson's role in
the campaign, but neither side would give details.
   ``It's part of a series of meetings to ensure ongoing
communication with all parts of the party and to make certain
everyone gets involved,'' committee spokeswoman Julie Anbender said
in Washington.
   Also Wednesday, Bush told a group of young inventors ``this
election is really about you,'' saying they and other young people
hold the key to the 21st century.
   ``Education is the engine that drives our inventive spirit,''
the vice president said, reiterating his frequently sounded theme
that he wants to be the ``education president.''

<HEAD>O'Connor Disagrees With Koch On British In N. Ireland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, breaking with fellow
peace pilgrim Mayor Edward I. Koch, said Wednesday that Britain
should remove its ``occupying forces'' from Northern Ireland
``within a reasonable time.''
   ``I cannot imagine there will be lasting peace ... until all
British troops have withdrawn,'' he told reporters as he left
Ireland after a six-day peace pilgrimage.
   O'Connor had said at the start of the pilgrimage that he'd come
to pray, not to talk politics. But the cardinal broke his silence
after Koch, his pilgrimage companion, reversed himself and endorsed
the British presence in Ulster.
   O'Connor, who returned Wednesday afternoon to John F. Kennedy
Airport, called on British officials to announce ``a phased
withdrawal'' _ one the cardinal said was supported by most people
in the province.
   Asked if it should begin immediately, O'Connor replied, ``That's
not for me to say.''
   Before leaving Dublin on Tuesday, Koch said a day in Northern
Ireland had convinced him the British do not deserve ``the
castigation that many of us, myself included, have heaped upon
them. The British army is not an `occupation force,' (but rather) a
guardian of peace.''
   The British army has patrolled Northern Ireland since the early
1970s, when a Catholic civil rights movement came under attack by
Protestant police and paramilitary groups.
   But the Protestant violence also revitalized the Irish
Republican Army; since then, the primary opponents have been the
British and the IRA, which wants to unite the island.
   In recent years many British troops have been withdrawn, and
their duties assumed by members of Ulster's army reserve.
   About two-thirds of Northern Ireland's population is Protestant,
and surveys indicate that a majority of the province's residents _
including many Catholics _ favor union with Britain.
   O'Connor said his own 24 hours in Ulster convinced him there is
``an environment of increasing understanding'' between Catholics
and Protestants, and that ``an overwhelming number'' of both want
the troops out.
   Although O'Connor said he based his conclusion on talks with
Protestants, he did not meet with militants in either community
during his visit.
   The mayor's comments drew a heated response from Irish-American
politicians, including Nassau County Comptroller Peter King, who
called the remarks ``senseless and ridiculous.''
   O'Connor was more circumspect. He said he was not angry with
Koch, and felt that because Koch did not grow up as an
Irish-American, he failed to realize the British have been calling
themselves peacemakers in Northern Ireland for centuries.

   Rude treatment by a clerk at a Radio Shack
store prompted a customer to call the store and complain. But it
turned out that the man who waited on her was a robber, police say.
   Three men walked into the suburban Colerain store Tuesday,
pulled a revolver on a clerk, then took him to a back room and tied
him up, police said.
   Before the three could take anything, the woman, whom police
would not identify, walked in. One of the gunmen, who was wearing a
white dress shirt, went behind a counter to wait on her.
   She purchased her merchandise and left, and the three then
escaped. Police arrived after the clerk freed himself, and an
officer answered the woman's call of complaint about ``the demeanor
and conduct'' of the service, police said.
   Officers told her she had been waited on by a burglar and asked
her to return to the store to help identify the robbers. No arrests
were made.

<TEXT>
   Four highway billboards that urge
motorists not to give to street beggars have drawn some
uncharitable comments from the city's Chamber of Commerce, which
worries the advertisements may hurt El Paso's image.
   ``I'm concerned (they) may not do good service to the fact that
this city is a truly giving city,'' said John Dugan, president of
the El Paso Chamber of Commerce. ``It doesn't portray us as the
kind of city I know us to be.''
   An anonymous group paid for four billboards along Interstate 10
that read: ``Please don't give to beggars _ they cause traffic
problems.''
   The signs are the latest development in a controversy about
street beggars who cross the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico,
and panhandle on interstate access roads east of downtown.
   City Councilman Robert Candelaria, who participated in several
council discussions about the scores of beggars congregating at
access road intersections, said people who give encourage
panhandlers to return. He said givers can contribute in other ways.
   ``We feel sorry for the people, but they endanger their lives by
crossing near I-10,'' Candelaria said. ``Give your charitable
dollars to Project Hungry before you give to these beggars.''
   Some witnesses told the council earlier this month that
panhandlers often are employed by Juarez-based professional begging
rings, and that they often are not as needy as they seem.
   Jim Huff, president of the Bauman Co., which owns the
billboards, said the group that paid for the ads wishes to remain
anonymous. The ads cost about $1,200 and will be visible for about
two weeks, he said.

   Bavarian state officials are warning
people leaving on vacation to avoid sex and French kissing with
strangers as a precaution against AIDS.
   The recommendations, carried in a travelers' brochure issued
Wednesday, unleashed an angry debate over how the deadly disease is
transmitted.
   AIDS-Help, a West German group that gives AIDS advice, accused
state officials of trying to ``legitimize pseudo-medicine.'' The
group said the salivary gland cannot transmit AIDS.
   However, Michael Koch, an AIDS adviser to the Bavarian
government, said tests indicate it might be possible for the deadly
virus to be transmitted through mucous membranes.
   AIDS, which attacks the body's immune system, is spread mainly
by sexual contact, the use of contaminated needles among drug
abusers and transfusion of tainted blood.

   A child actress who starred in last summer's
``Jaws IV: The Revenge'' was killed with her mother Wednesday in an
apparent murder-suicide initiated by her father, who also died,
authorities said.
   The coroner had not yet identified the couple and the child, but
neighbors said the girl was Judith Barsi, 11, who starred in the
third sequel to the series about a man-eating shark.
   Miss Barsi also appeared in the partly fact-based television
movie ``Fatal Vision,'' playing a daughter of Dr. Jeffrey
MacDonald, who was convicted of killing his pregnant wife and both
his daughters at Fort Bragg, N.C., in 1970.
   Miss Barsi's father apparently shot the girl and the mother in
their heads, set the inside of the house on fire, then turned the
gun on himself, police said. The fire caused extensive damage to
the interior of the home.
   A researcher at Universal Studios confirmed Miss Barsi starred
in ``Jaws IV: The Revenge'' as a character called ``Thea.'' She
also performed in several commercials and had appeared in the
television show ``Growing Pains,'' neighbors said.
   ``She was adorable ... quite precocious, blonde and blue-eyed,''
said former neighbor Adrienne Conway. She said the mother and
father had been having marital problems.
   Neighbors said they heard an explosion at 8:30 a.m., then saw
flames shooting out of a front window of the tan, single-story
house on a quiet street. One neighbor tried to douse the flames
with water from a garden hose until firefighters arrived.
   Officers at the scene said the father, identified by neighbors
as Joe Barsi, apparently doused the interior of the couple's home
with gasoline and set it ablaze before shooting himself in the head.
   The mother, Maria Barsi, estimated to be about 40, was found in
the hallway and the body of Miss Barsi in a bedroom, officials
said. Both had been burned, said Fire Battalion Chief Jack Monroe.
   Los Angeles Police Lt. Warren Knowles said the man was found
still holding the gun.
   Neighbors said the girl had an extremely protective father.
   ``The child was not allowed to go anywhere, very few places
alone,'' said neighbor Linda Williams. ``Even when she came to our
home, it always had to be OK'd by Dad before she came up the street
because apparently he was afraid she would run away.''

<TEXT>
   A teacher contract that significantly boosts
salaries in the nation's fourth-largest school system and pays
$64,000 to some veteran educators won unanimous approval Wednesday
from the Dade County School Board.
   The three-year contract increases average teacher pay for the
upcoming academic year 28 percent to $33,066, more than $5,000
above the national median.
   ``The excuse that teachers could not do their jobs because of
low pay is no longer an excuse in this school system,'' said
Michael Krop, chairman of the seven-member school board. ``Many
school systems have talked about programs like this, but we did
something about it.''
   Krop said Dade has already received more applicants because of
publicity about the pay proposal.
   Dade County School Superintendent Joseph A. Fernandez said he
hoped the pay increase will raise the status of teaching in the
minds of students making career choices.
   ``We want young people making their professional decisions to
not look at teaching as a dead-end profession,'' Fernandez told the
school board.
   Dade County's system, with about 255,000 students and more than
15,200 teachers, is the nation's fourth-largest behind New York,
Los Angeles and Chicago.
   Under the contract, a first-year teacher would receive $23,000
annually and $64,000 a year would be paid to an educator with 14
years experience, a doctorate and who teaches summer school.
   The average salaries would increase to $36,042 the second year
and $39,646 the third year, said Dade County schools spokesman Andy
Gollan.

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Hear Goetz Gun Charge Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Court of Appeals, New York's
highest court, agreed Wednesday to hear Bernhard Goetz's appeal of
his conviction on charges that he illegally possessed the gun he
used to shoot four young men on a New York City subway in 1985.
   Without comment, Judge Joseph Bellacosa granted the appeal and
scheduled arguments for Oct. 17, said Court of Appeals spokesman
Walter Mordaunt.
   Goetz's original sentence on the gun possession charges had been
ruled illegal by a Manhattan appeals court and his resentencing is
set for Oct. 22 in Manhattan.
   Goetz's lawyers claim that state Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Crane, the trial judge, erred in his instructions to the jury and
that the gun conviction should be overturned.
   Crane had originally sentenced Goetz to six months in jail, a
$5,000 fine, 280 hours of community service, five years probation
and psychiatric counseling. The Manhattan appeals court allowed all
but the jail term to stand.
   The appeals court ruled that Crane should give Goetz an
undeterminate sentence or, if sentencing was going to be under New
York's gun control laws, a definite one-year term without probation.
   Goetz, 40, was convicted last summer of third-degree illegal
possession of a gun in connection with the December 1984 shooting
aboard a subway of four teen-agers he said were trying to rob him.
The young men claimed they were panhandling for money.
   Goetz was acquitted of all but the gun charge.

   Scores of small quakes have rattled an
Aleut fishing village during the past 17 days, and geologists say
they are keeping a wary eye on the possible source: a volcano
that's been dormant for centuries.
   King Cove village is only nine miles from Mount Dutton's
4,834-foot peak. About 1,000 people live in the village during the
summer; 700 stay through winter.
   Aside from the earthquakes that have been jolting the community
625 miles southwest of Anchorage, there have been no other signs of
an imminent eruption, said Betsy Yount, a U.S. Geological Survey
geologist here.
   ``There's no melting back of snow around the summit. No
steam-type vents,'' sher said Wednesday. ``We're still assessing
the seismic activity to determine whether it's related to volcanic
activity or not.''
   Geologists are unsure when Mount Dutton last erupted.
   ``There's no historical records of its erupting. That means in
the past 200 or so years,'' said John Davies, state seismologist
and coordinating scientist for the newly formed Alaska Volcano
Observatory. ``It may have erupted 500 years ago, but we have no
date. Clearly, it's erupted in the last 10,000 years or so.''
   John Taber, a geologist with Columbia University's Lamont
Doherty Geological Observatory at Palisades, N.Y., said
seismographs first picked up earthquake activity near Mount Dutton
on July 11. Some of the 18 instruments installed by the institute
to monitor Aleutian Arc volcanic activity indicated the first
temblors were centered 10 to 15 miles southeast of the peak, he
said.
   ``In the last three or four days its been dying off,'' Taber
said from the institute's Sand Point office. ``There's no cause for
concern at this point at all. There was a sequence of (earthquakes)
in 1984. They were smaller, but they went on for about four months.
It's not even unusual to have them there.''
   Scores of quakes ranging from 1.0 to 3.6 on the Richter scale
have struck in this round. The peak activity occurred Friday, when
127 were recorded, Taber said. On Monday, there were 25, he said.
   The epicenters moved slowly toward the Mount Dutton, and in the
last few days, the centers have been underneath the volcano's south
flank, Taber said.
   The temblors have jolted the nearby village regularly. ``We've
felt four or five in a day, that's probably the most. But there's
no other sign of activity at all,'' said Cynthia Samuelson, city
clerk the village on the Alaska Peninsula. ``People are concerned,
but no one's leaving.''
   Alaska Division of Emergency Services officials had been
scheduled to travel to King Cove in September, but went this week
because of the earthquakes, said Jim Sey, the agency's chief of
operations and planning.
   ``The main purpose was just to answer questions, make people
aware and bring them up to date on what's happening and explain
different things they could do if there were an eruption,'' Sey
said.
   A telephone line is being installed so that the Geophysical
Institute at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks can monitor Taber's
seismographs, plus one Davies recently installed on the mountain's
flank. Taber has been in Alaska servicing his observatory's
seismographs and plans to leave this week, Davies said.
   The link will allow scientists in Fairbanks to check the
volcano's pulse virtually around the clock, he said.
   ``We're going to monitor it as closely as we can,'' he said.

   Cambodia's prime minister was quoted
Thursday as saying Khmer Rouge guerrilla delegates tried to
obstruct agreements at talks on ending Cambodia's civil war.
   The Jakarta Post quoted Prime Minister Hun Sen of the
Vietnamese-installed government as saying he would hold a third
round of separate peace talks with resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk in Paris in October.
   Sihanouk's forces are allied with the communist Khmer Rouge and
Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front in a coalition
fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Hun Sen, the guerrilla groups, Vietnam, Laos and the six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Thursday began their
fourth day of informal peace talks in Bogor.
   The Jakarta Post reported that Hun Sen said Khieu Samphan, the
Khmer Rouge representative, ``was not forthcoming to the point of
acting obstructive when it came to nailing down some specific
points of agreement.''
   On Wednesday, Sihanouk urged all factions to agree on a plan for
ending the ``miseries and humiliations'' that have afflicted
Cambodia since the Indochina war ended in 1975.
   The enduringly popular leader, who ruled Cambodia until 1970,
made the remarks in Jakarta, where he has tried to influence
developments in a meeting of the four factions at Bogor, about 40
miles south of the capital. All factions agree that Sihanouk, 65,
should have a central role in the future leadership.
   ``I ask you not to leave Indonesia without having signed
together a joint communique which shall tell our people and the
world that the four Cambodian factions are at least capable to
understand each other on certain essential points ... leading us
towards the end of a long and dark tunnel,'' Sihanouk said.
   Evoking the glories of Cambodian history, he said: ``Allow me to
recall that you all pretend to be the dignified descendants of the
very glorious builders of the world famous monuments of Angkor.
   ``If, like dignified descendants of the builders of Angkor, our
four factions wish to rapidly get rid of the last Vietnamese units
from our soil, they will only succeed to do so by achieving
national reconciliation and unity.''
   Angkor, in northwestern Cambodia, was the capital of the Khmer
Empire from the 9th century to the 15th. Its most imposing
monuments are Angkor Wat, a temple complex built in the 12th
century by King Suryavariman II, and Angkor Thom, built about 1200
by King Jayavarman VII.
   Sihanouk said, speaking in English, that it is handy to blame
Vietnam for all Cambodia's troubles, ``but it is not less true that
some Khmer (Cambodian) factions are equally heavily responsible for
these miseries and humilations.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the Khmer
Rouge regime of Pol Pot, which gained control at the end of the war
and had killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.
   More than 100,000 Vietnamese soldiers remain in Cambodia,
fighting the resistance coalition Sihanouk formerly led. Hanoi has
said it will withdraw all its troops by early 1990.
   The prince called for an interim government of the four factions
under ``a collegial system perfectly equal,'' and proposed that
fighting units be kept intact under a general staff representing
all factions. Each government department would have four
co-ministers.
   An international conference convened under the auspices of the
U.N. secretary-general would supervise withdrawal of foreign
forces, guarantee the nation's neutrality and help organize free
elections.
   Sihanouk resigned earlier this month as head of the resistance
coalition and is in Jakarta as a guest of President Suharto, which
allows him to participate in the peace talks indirectly.
   Hun Sen presented his own peace plan at Bogor on Monday, and
Sihanouk said his proposals include some of its points.
   ``I think my proposal is the most realistic,'' he said. ``The
very solution is in my proposals, not those of the charming Hun
Sen. I have to reject all other proposals in favor of mine.''
   He and Hun Sen negotiated in Paris last December and January
without finding a formula for peace.
   Son Sann said he supported Sihanouk's plan but the other
participants were not available for comment. Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam told a news conference Wednesday that
working groups would be formed to prepare for further negotiations.
   No conclusive agreement had been expected from the Bogor
conference, which was considered a success for merely taking place.

   A 24-year-old carpenter was charged in federal
court Wednesday in connection with a series of pipe bombs planted
last week on streets, in a mailbox and in a newspaper vending
machine in two suburban towns.
   Jonathan E. Tefft, who said he had homes in both Framingham,
Mass., and Belmont, N.H., was charged in U.S. District Court with
unlawful possession of an unregistered destructive device,
interstate transportation of 10 destructive devices and malicious
damage to property by means of an explosion.
   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in jail
and a $250,000 fine.
   Charles Thomson, assistant agent in charge of the Boston office
of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said an
investigation is continuing and there may be other arrests in the
case.
   Three of the homemade pipe bombs exploded in Needham last week,
one each outside the police and fire department and one in a
newspaper vending machine about 15 seconds after a jogger ran by.
All mailboxes in the town were sealed after a fourth bomb was found
unexploded in a box outside the post office.
   Two undetonated devices were found later in neighboring
Wellesely.
   Authorities said Tefft gave no reason for exploding the devices.
They declined to say whether he was involved in all the incidents,
but they said he traveled between Needham and New Hampshire to make
and plant some of the devices.
   Tefft was arrested late Tuesday by ATF agents assisted by state
and local police as he drove into a friend's driveway in Needham,
authorities said.
   The bombs were made of galvanized pipes about 6 inches long,
filled with gunpowder, threaded and capped on both ends, with fuse
holes in the middle, authorities said.
   Trooper Michael Cherven, who is assigned to the state fire
marshal's office, said ``any spark, heat source or static''
electricity could cause the bombs to explode.
   Joseph Sainato, senior explosives technician with the state
police, said the bomb found in the mailbox was ``as powerful as a
military grenade ... (and) could send 10 pieces of shrapnel flying
off at 6,000 feet a second.''

<TEXT>
   Back in 1936, Republican Alf Landon campaigned
against Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal by telling voters,
``I believe that a man can be a liberal without being a
spendthrift.''
   How times have changed.
   The Republicans wouldn't dare call themselves liberals in this
presidential campaign, and President Reagan says the Democrats
won't either.
   ``You'll never hear that `L' word - liberal - from them,'' the
president said in his radio address last weekend.
   Some liberals and academics agree with the president, although
they say the issues underlying the question of liberalism will
still be part of the campaign just as they have been since New Deal
days.
   Landon's claim to being a liberal didn't do him much good.
Roosevelt was re-elected in the biggest electoral landslide in the
history of U.S. presidential elections.
   After that the political landscape shifted, and by 1964,
presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was telling fellow
Republicans, ``Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and
moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.''
   Goldwater fared little better than Landon, as voters gave a
green light to Lyndon B. Johnson's ``Great Society.''
   Not all of Johnson's programs turned out as their backers hoped,
however. And, as resistance to the Vietnam war deepened, liberalism
took on a new face _ one which drew the scorn of the then-governor
of California, Ronald Reagan, among others.
   ``The word `liberal' came to be associated with costly
government activities which didn't eradicate the problems for which
they were intended,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, professor of political
science and public affairs at The George Washington University.
   ``Secondly, the word `liberal' got a bad connotation because of
the protests over the war in Vietnam. I think the word liberal
started getting a real bad rap during the period from 1968 to 1972,
culminating in the George McGovern candidacy.''
   Marc A. Pearl, director of the liberal organization Americans
for Democratic Action, conceded, ``There is a recognition on the
part of many liberals, of many Democrats, that to admit to being a
liberal somehow is a detriment, is a negative.''
   Richard Moe, a former aide to 1984 Democratic nominee Walter F.
Mondale, said he doesn't think it makes much difference what the
Republicans or the Democrats call each other.
   ``All of these labels take on different meanings in different
contexts at different times,'' said Moe. ``There is an ebb and flow
to American history. I don't attach much significance to labels or
what people say about labels. I think the election is going to be
fought out on a different ground.''
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis suggested one
ground when he said in his acceptance speech that ``this election
is not about ideology; it's about competence.''
   ``If that becomes the case, it would be the first one in modern
political history that was able to achieve that,'' said the ADA's
Pearl.
   Instead, suggested Pearl, ``they are all going to be fighting
for the center, as it were, because that's where the decisions are
going to be made.''
   Wayne put it this way: ``I think the new Democratic position is
to be conservative on economic issues, and liberal on social
issues.''
   Sounds a lot like Alf Landon, doesn't it?

   Playboy empire founder Hugh Hefner said he
chose to give up life as a pajama-clad swinging single and marry
model Kimberley Conrad because ``it will make the relationship
better.''
   Hefner proposed to Ms. Conrad Playboy magazine's Miss January
1988, on Saturday over the wishing well at the Playboy Mansion,
where many other women have shared his life but never completely
captured his heart.
   ``I always had the feeling before that there was something else,
some further personal adventure waiting over the hill,'' he said in
a telephone interview Wednesday.
   But in this case, he said: ``It is inconceivable that there
could be something else that could be comparable or better.''
   Hefner, 62, described his fiancee as ``a homebody,'' who despite
the age difference holds similar interests in things like animals
and spending evenings talking and watching old movies.
   Ms. Conrad, who turns 26 next week, said she thought about
Hefner's proposal for a minute, then said ```Yes' because I can't
imagine life without him.''
   She plans to give up modeling. ``I'd rather be at home with Hef.
He's my priority,'' she said.
   Ms. Conrad's family apparently is supporting the marriage,
planned for sometime next year at the mansion.
   ``I wish them all the luck in the world,'' her grandmother Lila
Aldridge said Wednesday from her home in Moulton, Ala., where her
granddaughter was born.
   Hefner said he has never proposed marriage to anyone ``nor ever
really considered marriage'' since his 1958 divorce from his first
wife.
   ``I am doing it as much for myself as for her,'' he said. ``It
is going to make the relationship better, that security, that
continuity, that reaffirmation.''
   Ms. Conrad, who met Hefner last summer during a photo shooting,
moved into the Playboy Mansion with two dogs and cat shortly after
Hefner's longtime flame Carrie Leigh moved out in January.
   Earlier this year, Ms. Leigh, Playboy's 1983 cover girl,
attempted to bring a $35 million palimony action against Hefner
after their affair soured, but it later was dropped.
   Ms. Leigh said Wednesday through manager Joseph Battig: ``I hope
that he's finally happy at 62 years of age.''

<HEAD>Blackout Blamed On Leftist Guerrillas Hits Capital Before Garcia
Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blackout hit the capital and most of coastal
Peru Wednesday night, hours before President Alan Garcia was to
give his state-of-the-union address.
   Leftist guerrillas may have sabotaged power lines and caused the
blackout, said Jose Acevedo, spokesman for the state power company
Electro-Peru.
   Shining Path guerrillas and a smaller rebel group, the pro-Cuban
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, have caused dozens of blackouts
in Peru and used the cover of darkness to launch attacks.
   Radio Programas, Peru's leading news station, said people heard
explosions in several parts of the capital. Police told The
Associated Press they had no reports of guerrilla violence during
the power outage.
   The blackout at 8:15 p.m. affected Lima, cities along the 600
miles of the central Peruvian coastline and the highland city of
Huancayo, 125 miles east of Lima, Acevedo said.
   Power was restored to most areas within an hour, but areas south
of Lima were still without electrticity late Wednesday night,
Acevedo said.
   Garcia planned to speak midday Thursday and is expected to
address growing violence by leftist guerrillas.
   The government says more than 12,000 people have been killed in
the violence connected to the 8-year-old insurgency of the Shining
Path, a Maoist guerrilla group.

<HEAD>NHTSA: Nearly Half Auto Crash Tests Show Chance of Severe Head
Injury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the 37 cars, vans and light trucks
that have been crash tested by the government this year would
likely cause severe head injuries or death to their drivers in a 35
mph collision.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday
released its final report on 1988 crash tests with results showing
drivers of vans and light trucks were at high risk of severe head
injuries in a crash.
   Drivers of compact cars were least likely to have severe head
injuries, the agency's figures showed.
   NHTSA reported the likelihood of injury as an index called the
head-injury criterion. The agency derived the index from monitoring
dummies strapped into vehicles that were crashed into a fixed
barrier at 35 mph.
   Seventeen of the 1988 vehicles tested produced a head-injury
criterion above 1,000, levels that show a high chance of severe
head injury or death.
   NHTSA cautioned it tested only one vehicle of each model, and
additional tests could produce varying results ``due to slight
differences in the way vehicles are manufactured and equipped, or
due to slight variations in test conditions.''
   Small differences in the test results should not be considered
significant, NHTSA said.
   The Chevrolet G-20 van showed the greatest likelihood of head
injury to the driver, with an index of 3,665. The Mazda 929 4-door
car, a large and mid-size model, showed the least likelihood, with
an index of 273.
   Tests of nine subcompact cars found five with an index of more
than 1,000. The average for the nine vehicles was 966.
   Subcompact cars showing the greatest chance of head injury and
the criteria reported by NHTSA were the Dodge Colt 4-door station
wagon, 1,354; Nissan Pulsar NX 2-door hatchback, 1,134; Volkswagen
Fox 2-door, 1,114; Ford Festiva 2-door, 1,014; and the Toyota
Tercel 2-door hatchback, 1,005.
   Two of the nine compact cars tested produced head-injury
criteria exceeding 1,000. The average head-injury criterion for
that class of car was 887.
   Compact cars most likely to cause head injury were the Peugeot
505 GLS 4-door, 1,701, and the Nissan Sentra 4-door wagon, 1,047.
   The tests found three out of nine large and mid-size cars with
criteria above 1,000. The average head-injury criterion for larger
and mid-size cars was 921.
   Large and mid-size cars with head-injury criteria exceeding
1,000 were the Renault Medallion 4-door, 1,656, Buick Park Avenue
4-door, 1,467; and the Chrysler New Yorker, 1,362.
   The agency tested 10 vans and small trucks and found seven with
head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000. The average index for the
vehicles was 1,491.
   Trucks and vans showing the greatest likelihood of head injury
were the Chevrolet G-20 van, 3,665; Isuzu Spacecab pickup, 1,873;
Chevrolet Astro Van, 1,603; Nissan NL LEV pickup, 1,528; Mitsubishi
Montero 4x4, 1,320; Volkswagen Vanagon, 1,320; and the Ford F-150
pickup, 1,074.
   NHTSA's 35 mph crash-test program is not used in the agency's
regulation of the automakers but is intended solely as a guide to
consumers, the agency said.
   For regulatory purposes, each manufacturer crash tests its own
vehicles at 30 mph before the model-year begins. The results are
usually kept secret for competitive reasons.
   Vehicles that test with head-injury criteria exceeding 1,000
must be redesigned before being placed on the market.
   Also, NHTSA conducts random testing at 30 mph to check results
certified by the automakers.
   A 35 mph crash is one-third more severe than a 30 mph crash.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen is fending off questions about differences with
running mate Michael Dukakis and working to point up his
differences with Republican standard-bearer George Bush.
   ``You're going to see diversity in both parties,'' he told
reporters, pressing him to answer Bush's charge that they had more
in common than Bentsen and Dukakis. He also brushed aside GOP
statements that the Democrats had effectively created a three-man
ticket that includes Jesse Jackson.
   ``I don't think there's anything to it,'' he said.
   Bentsen said he still might vote for new aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras, despite Dukakis' opposition.
   As for Dukakis opposing Bentsen's plan to impose an import oil
fee, he joked, ``I haven't been able to convince George Bush
either.''
   Bentsen's comments came following a speech in Albuquerque to a
businesswomen's convention, in which he tied Bush to Reagan
administration policies opposed by feminists. Bentsen supports the
Equal Rights Amendment and several other initiatives supported by
the women's group.
   The campaign stop in Albuquerque was at the start of a four-day
cross-country campaign swing, which continues with speeches today
in San Francisco and Reno, Nev. The campaign will then travel to
Los Angeles; Amarillo, Texas; and a finale in either Lousiana or
Mississippi.
   Events will be designed to highlight some of Bentsen's
differences with the GOP and not with Dukakis, such as the
senator's work on the trade and plant-closing notification bills,
and of energy independence programs.
   Bentsen's speech to the National Federation of Business and
Professional Women came just three days after Bush unveiled a $2.2
billion child care plan before the same group.
   ``It's interestng to me that it's taken eight years (for the
Republicans) to discover day care,'' said Bentsen. Just last year,
he said, the White House fought ``every step of the way'' against
just $50 million proposed for child care for poor women.
   Bentsen himself has not endorsed a $2.5 billion Democratic day
care proposal, which won the approval Wednesday of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee.
   But Bentsen told the group that the ``gender gap'' _ the pattern
of women supporting Democrats in greater proportions than men _ was
a direct result of the GOP record on issues including the equal
rights amendment, equal pay and the law banning discrimination by
institutions receiving federal money.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration opposes the ERA ... they ripped
it out of the (Republican) platform,'' he said. ``They oppose the
study that will provide the legal foundation for women who are
discriminated against to bring their case to court and win.''
   Bentsen said Reagan's veto of the bill overriding the Grove City
ruling of the Supreme Court, which weakened federal anti-bias
rules, showed ``this administration tried to compromise equality.
... But we overrode that veto. And we scored a major victory for
equality and opportunity in America.
   ``The gender gap... wasn't created by accident,'' he said.
   At the end of his speech, Bentsen was presented with a red
purse, the group's symbol of how women make less money for
comparable work.
   ``By the end of the Dukakis-Bentsen administration,'' he
promised, ``this purse will be black.'' He received a standing
ovation from the 2,000 women in the convention hall, several of
whom held up Dukakis-Bentsen campaign signs.
   Bentsen supports pay equity legislation in Congress but not the
more ambitious comparable worth legislation. He told reporters
after his speech he wanted to go one step at a time. He also said
he had not yet endorsed maternal leave legislation and has not had
time to study it.
   The businesswomen's group, founded in 1919, has 125,000 members
nationwide, of which 51 percent list themselves as Republicans, 47
percent Democrats and the rest independent, according to executive
director Linda Dorian.
   ``There was a lot of enthusiasm for Sen. Bentsen and what he had
to say,'' said Ms. Dorian. The group was conducting a straw poll
and planned to release the results today.

<TEXT>
   Score one for the environmentalists in their
protracted battle with tree-cutters in America's largest national
forest.
   By a lopsided 361-47 vote, the House on Wednesday approved
legislation to scrap the 1980 law that groups like the Wilderness
Society say is responsible for overharvesting and big Treasury
losses in the Tongass forest in Alaska.
   The bill moved over to the Senate, where Alaska's two members
could have more success in blocking it in the final weeks of the
1988 session than its lone representative, Republican Don Young,
had in the House.
   The legislation would scrap a 1980 law that guarantees the U.S.
Forest Service at least $40 million a year to support commercial
timber sales in the Tongass, the continent's last large temperate
rain forest.
   Supporters of the bill say the guarantee _ unique for U.S.
national forests _ has not only led to destruction of ancient trees
but also produced red ink as Tongass timber sales posted a deficit
of $254 million from 1982 through 1987.
   Young argued unsuccessfully that the the bill repudiates a deal
made in 1980 with environmentalists when Congress put huge portions
of Alaska's vast acreage off-limits to development.
   He said that in return for allowing 8.5 million of the forest's
17 million acres to be declared wilderness, Alaska lawmakers won
the spending guarantee and another requiring the forest service to
make an average of 450 million board feet of Tongass timber
available for sale each year.
   ``The leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word,'' said
Young, who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve
some 6,000 timber-related jobs in Southeast Alaska.
   ``It's a matter of jobs,'' Young said. ``There are people's
livelihoods at stake.''
   But backers of the legislation argued that the Tongass region
should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic
growth. They said overharvesting the Tongass hurts both tourism and
fisheries.
   Besides getting rid of the guarantees, the overhaul bill
sponsored principally by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y, would put
another 1.7 million Tongass acres off-limits to timber cutting for
five years.
   Much of the Tongass timber is sold to two large corporations,
Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan and the Japanese-owned Alaska Lumber
and Pulp Co., which turn it into pulp, chiefly for export to Japan.
   The bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the
50-year contracts it entered into with these companies in the 1950s.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the bill's floor manager, said new
contracts are needed to encourage competition in Tongass timbering,
prevent excessive cutting of old-growth stands and ensure that the
companies pay more for Tongass trees.
   Miller said a mature Sitka spruce from Tongass now sells for
$1.48, compared to $2 for a map of the national forest.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former army general Sein Lwin was elected
president Wednesday, one day after being named party leader, and
rioting broke out in a northern city in which one person was
reported killed and five wounded.
   The official News Agency Burma said a curfew was imposed in
Myede, 220 miles north of Rangoon, after hundreds of rioters on
Tuesday destroyed buildings and attacked police, who fired their
guns to disperse the crowd.
   Sources in the area said one person was killed and five wounded.
   It was not immediately known if the violence was related to this
week's leadership changes, which included the naming Wednesday of
active or retired military officers to all but two of the cabinet's
22 posts.
   Western diplomats had said the rise of Sein Lwin, a 64-year-old
hardliner known for his ruthless supression of dissidents, could
lead to more of the anti-government protests that have broken out
three times since October.
   Travelers returning from Rangoon said leaflets have appeared in
recent days urging continued anti-government agitation.
   A one-day, emergency session of Parliament elected Sein Lwin
president. On Tuesday, he assumed the nation's most powerful
position, chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party, at a
special party congress.
   The Parliament elected the former deputy prime minister, Tun
Tin, as prime minister. Vice President Aye Ko remained in his post.
   Defense Minister Kyaw Htin moved to the No. 3 government
position as head of the Council of State, part of a realignment
that saw changes in eight of the 22 major government positions.
   Only two civilians were included in the new lineup: Attorney
General Maung Maung and Education Minister Kyaw Sein. The rest are
retired or active duty military officers.
   The selections appeared to represent a continuation of the
hard-line, one-party system instituted 26 years ago by Ne Win, who
resigned Saturday as president and party chairman.
   However, a number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed, and
some balance within the top echelons appears to have been reached
by the promotions of Kyaw Htin and Tun Tin. Both are regarded as
relatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with
dissent in the country. Kyaw Htin also moved up to a top party post.
   Sein Lwin, a close associate of Ne Win, commanded forces that
brutally put down student riots in March in which dozens of people
died.
   Several other officials were reprimanded or fired, including
former Prime Minister Maung Maung Kha, for their handling of the
March 18 unrest in Rangoon, but Sein Lwin escaped officially
unscathed by the incident.
   The government has admitted that 43 people died, 41 of them
suffocating in a crowded police van while being taken to prison.
Unofficial reports said more than 100 people were killed.
   Sein Lwin, who formerly ranked No. 4 in the party hierarchy,
also commanded the Fourth Burma Rifles, a unit that opened fire on
about 2,000 anti-government demonstrators at Rangoon University on
July, 7, 1962. Unofficial casualties were put at more than 100, and
the following day authorities blew up the university's student
union building.
   Sein Lwin was also involved in putting down demonstrations in
1974, when students and Buddhist monks, angry at a shoddy
government funeral for former U.N. Secretary-General U Thant,
snatched his coffin and brought it to Rangoon University. Troops
firing rifles later stormed the campus.
   Ne Win cited his age and the recent unrest when he resigned. In
his resignation speech, he raised hopes that major changes were in
store for Burma. In an unprecedented move, he called for a
referendum to decide whether the country wished to continue with
one-party rule or opt for a multiparty system.
   The congress turned down the referendum proposal.
   Ne Win's resignation followed three periods of student-led
rioting. There also is mounting discontent over deteriorating
economic conditions that have made Burma one of the world's 10
poorest nations, despite its abundance of natural resources.
   The congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms,
including allowing joint ventures between private foreign and local
investors and loosening control on a number of sectors, including
agriculture and forestry. There was initial skepticism among
diplomats about how far these will go and whether the current
leaders can implement them.
   Several diplomats said that the new lineup lacks the expertise
in dealing with anything but a state-controlled system, which has
led to plummeting industrial production, food shortages, a foreign
debt of about $4 million and meager social services.
   ``That the country has gone from bad to worse (26) years after
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool's
paradise,'' Aung Gyi, a respected government critic, wrote to Ne
Win on May 12. ``The country has plunged to the bottom politically,
economically and socially. The moral decay is the most deplorable.''
   Aung Gyi resigned from Ne Win's government in 1963. His letter
has been widely circulated underground in Rangoon. Ne Win is
believed to hold his old comrade-in-arms in some respect but there
has been speculation the government would move to silence him.

<DATELINE>LAOHEKOU, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chen Wenbao doesn't consider himself
religious, but each night he puts a stick of incense outside the
door of his house and prays for rain.
   ``There's no other way. I have to rely on heaven,'' Chen said
this week in this village in northern Hubei province.
   Chen, his wife, three children and mother live in the heart of
China's drought country, stricken this year with its worst blight
in 50 years.
   Beginning as early as February in some parts of central and
eastern China, the drought has hit eight out of China's 30
provinces.
   Officials in Hubei say about half of the province's rice crop
and 70 percent of its peanut and sesame crops will be affected. In
addition, they worry about starvation in some areas like Laohekou.
   The Chinese news media have cited similar figures for grain and
vegetable production in other provinces. Officials said other
provinces also faced the possibility of starvation.
   Laohekou has been hit particularly hard by the drought. The
village's reservoir is bone dry for the first time since it opened
in 1958. Wells for drinking water contain only mud. Trucks carrying
potable water from the nearest town, Xiangfan, are few.
   Draft animals have been dying, some because of the heat, which
has hovered around 104 degrees for weeks, others because of thirst.
   Chen, 33, said he's concerned for his family.
   This spring he planted about 2{ acres of land. In a good year,
with the rich Hubei soil, Chen said he could clear $540 profit from
his fields, well above the average farmer's annual income of $125.
   But this year, the fields are barren.
   ``My mungbeans are burned. My cotton should be up to my chest
but it only hits my ankle so it will be worthless. My tobacco is
dead,'' Chen said, pausing to spit in the dust outside his brick
house. ``We'll have no vegetables this year and no money.''
   Under China's recent agricultural reforms, peasants sign a
contract with the government, promising to produce a certain amount
of grain. That grain is then sold to the state at a fixed price,
well below what it would get on the free market.
   Anything extra can be sold for market value. In addition, all
vegetables and cash crops can be sold on the market.
   But without a harvest of vegetables or cash crops, Chen will
have no money.
   Chen said he and his family will live on the winter wheat he
harvested earlier this year. But after fulfilling his contract with
the state, only 3,000 pounds remained. Chinese officials say one
person needs at least 550 pounds of grain a year to survive, so
Chen's family of six has come up short.
   Chen has pulled up some cotton and planted sweet potatoes to try
and fill the gap.
   ``That's why I'm asking heaven for rain,'' he said. ``But if
there's no rain, then things won't be good at all.''
   Chen said that if the rains don't come he'll probably take a job
in a nearby rock quarry with other villagers, making $1.60 a day.
   ``It will help to feed my family because no one here wants to
beg,'' he said. ``But really I don't want to leave the land.''

<HEAD>False Drug Test Results Often Mean Loss of Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People victimized by erroneous drug test
results frequently face loss of their jobs and few are in a
position to defend themselves adequately, Congress has been told.
   Mark L. Waple, a Fayetteville, N.C., attorney who has handled
more than 500 drug test cases in the past six years, said Wednesday
that such a person ``loses the presumption of innocence and is
instead burdened with a presumption of guilt.''
   Waple said that in at least 75 percent of his cases, ``there was
a significant legal or scientific irregularity which substantially
affected the reliability of the ultimate conclusion that the
individual had in fact used a controlled substance.''
   He said his clients have faced threats of incarceration, loss of
security clearances and hospital credentials as well as loss of
employment, rank and position.
   Waple told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations that the combination of the
``presumption of guilt'' and complex legal and scientific issues
makes it very difficult for a person to defend against the positive
test result.
   ``Very few individuals who test positive for controlled
substances will have a proper background either through experience
or education to know where to begin to defend themselves,'' he
said. ``Drug testing laboratories guard their scientific data,
their test results, their mathematical computations and their
standard operating procedures very carefully.''
   He called for ``complete and total disclosure of all of the data
supporting a positive test result.''

<HEAD>Mortgage Subsidies to Rural Poor Prove Cost-Effective, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-income rural homeowners who receive
federal mortgage subsidies have excellent repayment records and
benefit from a more stable family life, a private study of 894
households has found.
   The study by the non-profit Housing Assistance Council also said
the Farmers Home Administration's low-income home ownership program
is cost-effective and should be expanded.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the study released
Wednesday proves the program has succeeded in ``the very toughest,
hardscrabble places'' and that the poor are neither lazy nor
irresponsible and hopeless.
   ``After all of the attacks on housing assistance programs, this
study shows what really happens with subsidized homeownership
programs. ... These programs work,'' said Gonzalez, chairman of a
House subcommittee on housing.
   Subsidies to participants in the program declined over a
five-year period as their incomes increased, and the number of
children living below the poverty level decreased, the study said.
   The council tracked 894 sample families nationwide who obtained
subsizied mortgages in 1981 and concluded the rural homeownership
program ``represents a cost-effective strategy to provide decent
shelter to low-income households and to assist them in overcoming
the burden of poverty.''
   The study, financed with a grant from the Ford Foundation, also
found homeownership had indirect benefits, particularly on
children, such as stabilizing family life.
   In 1986, when most borrowers had five years' experience with the
program, the study found most were ahead in their payments. Only 7
percent were as much as three months behind, 5 percent had returned
their homes to the FmHA, and only 1.3 percent had lost their homes
to foreclosure.
   Poverty-level borrowers were less likely than others to be
delinquent and more likely to be ahead in payments, the study
showed. At the same time, subsidies to the families declined
steadily.
   ``The decline in the subsidy was in part a reflection of upward
economic mobility, and this was most evident among young families
with children,'' the study said.
   The Washington-based council advises low-income and minority
groups seeking federal assistance for improving rural housing and
studies and makes recommendations for state and local housing
policies.
   Gonzalez said the program has been cut from $2.9 billion in 1979
to $1.1 billion last year. ``If anything, the need has grown,'' he
said.
   He and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said they are pressing
Congress to expand the program.

<HEAD>Study Sees Dramatic Climb in Foreign Investment in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in American companies, real
estate and other assets has increased dramatically in recent years
and is likely to keep climbing through the year 2000, according to
a new study.
   The private study, released Wednesday by the Congressional
Economic Leadership Institute, said direct foreign investment in
the United States has jumped by more than 215 percent since 1980,
while American investment abroad increased by only one-fifth that
rate.
   And the study said the pace of foreign investment is expected to
accelerate, with foreign buyouts in 1988 expected to make up as
much as 20 percent of all U.S. acquisitions, up from 5 percent in
1987.
   However, the report said that in absolute terms, foreign
investments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent of total
U.S. assets.
   The study said seven nations account for nearly 85 percent of
the foreign investment in the United States. They are Britain, with
$75 billion in cumulative investments by 1987; the Netherlands, $47
billion; Japan, $33 billion; Canada, $22 billion; West Germany, $20
billion; Switzerland, $14 billion; and France, $10 billion.
   Other findings include:
   _Foreign investors now own 10 percent of the U.S. manufacturing
base, with majority interest in the concrete and consumer
electronics industries and significant portions of machine tools,
chemicals and auto parts.
   _Most foreign outlays in the United States are to acquire
existing businesses rather than to establish new ones.
   _Jobs of nearly 3 million Americans are dependent on foreign
investment, up from just 1.1 million 10 years ago. Foreign
affiliates account for 7 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
   _More than 25 percent of all commercial and industrial loans in
the United States are owed to foreign banks.
   _More than 12.5 million acres of farm land in 49 states are
owned by foreigners, about 1 percent of the U.S. total.
   The study was compiled with data from the U.S. Commerce
Department and other sources. The institute is a private
organization founded in 1987 to act as a forum on economic policy
for lawmakers and business, labor and educational leaders.

<HEAD>Conservative Paper At Dartmouth Sues School Over Disciplinary
Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dartmouth College says ``bullying tactics''
aimed at a black professor by staffers of a stridently conservative
student publication led to suspensions that are now the subject of
two lawsuits.
   The Dartmouth Review's lawsuits accuse the college of reverse
discrimination against white students and of violating free speech
rights for suspending three of its staffers.
   The Review staffers were suspended following a confrontation in
a college classroom with a black music professor who earlier had
been harshly criticized in the independent, off-campus newspaper.
   Review attorney Harvey D. Myerson said ``the facts clearly
indicate that the students would not have been given such draconian
penalties if they were black students criticizing a white
professor.''
   But officials at the private liberal arts college in Hanover,
N.H., said Wednesday the disciplinary action against the students
was taken to preserve the ``integrity'' of the classroom.
   Described by its critics as anti-minority, anti-women and
anti-homosexual, the Review often has been the center of
controversy since it was founded in 1980.
   In March of this year, Dartmouth President David Freedman
blasted the paper, calling its staff ``ideological provocateurs
posing as journalists.''
   The faculty censured it in 1982 as racist and sexist after a
critique of Dartmouth's affirmative action programs, written in
what was intended to be black dialect and headlined: ``Dis Sho'
Ain't No Jive, Bro.''
   In 1984, a Review reporter secretly tape-recorded a Gay Students
Association meeting and published excerpts and the names of group
leaders.
   A Dartmouth disciplinary panel ruled in March that the three
Review staffers were guilty of disorderly conduct for failing to
leave Professor William Cole's classroom after being asked to do
so. The paper earlier had described Cole's music class as ``one of
Dartmouth's most academically deficient courses.''
   The paper's attorneys, who filed suits in federal and state
courts in New Hampshire, announced the action at a Capitol Hill
news conference Wednesday with support from three conservative
lawmakers.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the disciplinary actions
``nothing less than a crude assault on freedom of expression and
political diversity on campus.''
   ``The elite Ivy League academics constantly proclaim themselves
the champions of free speech and diversity of opinion. Yet here,
when a small band of students express a viewpoint offensive to the
prevailing orthodoxy, the college comes squarely down on the side
of suppression and harsh persecution.''
   Humphrey was joined at the news conference by Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., and Rep. Bob Smith, R-N.H.
   A state suit filed in New Hampshire Superior Court addresses the
free speech issue, while a federal suit filed in U.S. District
Court focuses on the reverse discrimination charge.
   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe, who attended the news
conference, said the disciplinary action had nothing to do with
First Amendment rights.
   ``The sanctity of a classroom is what this is all about,'' Huppe
said. ``Dartmouth College has got to protect the integrity of a
classroom. They went in there to disrupt his classroom.''
   Huppe accused the students of using ``bullying tactics'' in
their confrontation with the professor and their refusal to leave.
   After the classroom incident, Freedman, the college president,
said the paper had been ``irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel and
ugly'' and that it was trying to poison the ``intellectual
environment'' of the campus.

<HEAD>House Votes To Make Park Service Director Non-Political</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled House has given the
Reagan administration what amounts to a vote of no confidence for
its handling of America's network of national parks.
   The action came Wednesday as the chamber voted 248-130 for
Democratic legislation to strip political appointees in the
Interior Deparment of their day-to-day power over the National Park
Service.
   The vote capped nearly eight years of friction over a variety of
parks and federal land-use issues between the Republican
administration and Democrats on the House Interior Committee.
   The bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate in the waning
weeks of the 100th Congress. And if it reaches President Reagan's
desk, it will be vetoed, says Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   The proposal, sponsored principally by Rep. Bruce Vento,
D-Minn., would make the National Park Service director a
presidential appointee who would be confirmed by the Senate for a
five-year term.
   The director now serves at the pleasure of the White House and
the Interior secretary and can be removed at any time for any
reason. The bill would require a president to show cause before
firing a parks director.
   The legislation would strip the Interior secretary and assistant
secretaries of any authority over the park service except for its
budget, a matter on which Congress has the final word.
   The measure also would create a three-member park system review
board _ appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate _ to
advise the director and Congress on how to improve the national
parks.
   Vento, who leveled no criticism against parks director William
Penn Mott, said the changes are necessary because professionals in
the National Park Service have been ``supplanted by political
decision-making.''
   ``The director of the park service has consistently been ordered
(by superiors) to give political testimony,'' Vento said. ``The
director ought to be free to act, but he is undercut and undermined
constantly by political appointees.''
   He said that political appointees have forced resignations and
transfers of park superintendents they didn't like, changed
performance ratings for parks personnel and required park officials
to obtain clearance for testimony before congressional committees.
   ``It's time to put a stop to this,'' said Vento, who chairs the
Interior national parks and public lands subcommittee.
   Subcommittee member Richard Lehman, D-Calif., said that
``political expediency overrules professional judgment. This occurs
because the secretary of the Interior holds the reins.''
   Lehman said that the secretary cannot serve as the nation's
``chief park ranger'' when his other duties also make him ``the
chief miner, chief oil-driller, chief cattle grazer and chief water
developer.''
   Lagomarsino said the plan is unconstitutional, ``completely
unworkable'' and a ``dangerous precedent'' because it creates a
virtually independent entity within a Cabinet department.
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said that ``this legislation is the
worst kind of micromanagement. The country does not need a law
creating a new bureaucracy.''

   Apartment tenants need not fret for
fear their bawling babies will prompt legal action by angry
neighbors, a renters' group says.
   But the group's guidelines do strongly advise against letting
youngsters ride up and down apartment house elevators just for the
fun of it.
   The German Tenants' Association, which released its guidelines
to tenants on Wednesday, said children's laughter and crying are
not legally justified grounds for complaints by other renters.
   The same goes for noise from ``normal play activities'' inside
the children's own apartment, the Cologne-based group said.
   Behavior outside the apartment is another matter, though. The
group advised keeping thrill-seeking children out of elevators and
off roller skates and bicycles around stairwells and in basements.

   A man convicted of murdering his
in-laws, the well-known Marquis and Marchioness of Urquijo, hanged
himself in his prison cell, officials said.
   Rafael Escobedo was found dead Wednesday in El Dueso prison.
Officials said a guard found 34-year-old Escobedo hanging from the
iron bars of his cell window with a bedsheet wrapped around his
neck.
   Escobedo was serving two concurrent 26-year prison terms for the
murder of Manuel de la Sierra Torres, Marquis of Urquijo, and his
wife, Maria Lourdes. They were shot at their Madrid home on Aug. 1,
1980.
   Escobedo married Miriam de la Sierra, the couple's daughter, in
1978. Several years after the murder, she divorced Escobedo and
married Richard Dennis Rew, an American.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in the Soviet bloc, a
1956 speech in which Nikita Khrushchev denounced Josef Stalin's
brutal policies has been made public in a Communist party newspaper.
   The speech Khrushchev delivered three years after the death of
Stalin, his predecessor, marked the formal break with Stalinism in
the Soviet Union. It was leaked to Western reporters in 1956.
   The 400,000-circulation party weekly, Polityka, devoted four
full pages to the speech in its July 30 edition, which went on sale
to the public Wednesday. The paper also carried a half-page
commentary by two of its journalists.
   ``This is not the first time that it turns out that something
that is known to everybody must be said aloud sooner or later,''
the Polish weekly said.
   The publication comes as the Soviet Union, under Mikhail
Gorbachev's leadership, carries out a campaign to discredit Stalin
and shed light on dark pages of Soviet history. Polish leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Polish party have been strong
supporters of Gorbachev's moves toward ``glasnost,'' or openness.
   Khrushchev's speech, delivered at a closed meeting at the 20th
Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on Feb. 25, 1956, condemned
Stalin's ``cult of personality.''
   Khrushchev, who led the Soviet Union from 1958 to 1964, said
Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin warned that Stalin could be cruel.
   The speech blamed Stalin, who came to power in 1941, for
executions and deportations of people after show trials.
   About 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carried
out under Stalin and in the drive to collectivize agriculture,
according to estimates by Western historians.
   
   Polityka said that since 1956 it kept a copy numbered 2,094 of a
Polish reprint of the speech, which had been brought back from
Moscow by Polish guests to the Soviet congress.
   Leaders of the Polish United Workers Party, the country's ruling
communist party, at the time authorized reprinting the secret
speech for internal party use.
   ``Khrushchev did a great thing. But the leadership of the Polish
party has done a great thing also. The Polish text of the report is
the only official version until today,'' Polityka said.
   A spokeswoman for Polityka said Wednesday that no editors
authorized to comment on the publication were available.
   A spokesman for the Censor's Office in Warsaw, who identified
himself only as Mr. Osiek, said he could only comment generally
that, ``Today the range of freedoms to publish various information
... is so broad _ and getting broader day by day.''

   A mayor who told police officers to shoot
youngsters to stop them from brawling with sticks in a city park
rescinded the order Wednesday, saying he simply wanted to get the
attention of the ``hoodlums.''
   Mayor B.A. Johnson said he issued the order to ``shoot from the
waist down'' because youths from Wadley and nearby towns were
turning the 12-acre Hope Williams Memorial Park into a fighting
ring.
   ``I had not intended (for police) to shoot them anyway. It was
issued temporarily. I didn't think it would take very long for
those young people to get the idea we meant business,'' Johnson
said.
   ``It is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they
are not going to take over the city.''
   He said he'd learned ``some of my people are embarrassed'' by
the order. ``All and all, it is a thing that will fade away,'' he
added.
   Johnson, who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also
ordered them to shoot stray dogs, said as part of the attempt to
stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be
increased from $71.50 to $125.

   A Danish man tussled with the crew of
a trans-Atlantic flight, tried to open the airplane's door, and
threw a drink in the pilot's face after he was caught smoking,
police said.
   Oly Svane Thestrup, 41, of Copenhagen, was charged in a Winnipeg
court Wednesday.
   The incident happened Tuesday on a British Airways flight from
London to Los Angeles after a passenger set off a smoke detector in
a washroom on the Boeing 747, police said.
   He struggled with the crew, tried to open a door on the plane,
and threw a drink in the pilot's face, they said.
   The man was restrained but managed to free himself.
   The pilot landed at Winnipeg International Airport, where the
plane was met by police.

<HEAD>Agricultural Banks Were Strong Going Into Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary review by the Agriculture
Department says that many banks serving farmers were in much better
shape going into this summer's devastating drought than they would
have been a few years ago.
   The figures, which are far from conclusive, were compiled by the
department's Economic Research Service only through June 11. But
economists were able to make some general observations based upon
the situation leading up to and including the early months of the
1988 drought.
   ``Because changes in agricultural banking conditions tend to lag
changes in the farm economy, banks will not feel the full effects
of this year's drought until 1989,'' the agency said.
   Overall, the agency reports in a forthcoming issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine, agricultural commercial banks _
those with above-average concentrations of farm loans _ were
rebounding as farmers entered the spring planting season.
   ``Farm banks are better poised to deal with losses from
agricultural loans than they were a few years ago,'' the report
said. ``Their delinquent farm loans have been falling since
mid-1986, and the drop in real farmland values has bottomed out in
most parts of the country.''
   Even so, 20 percent of 543 agricultural banks classified as
``vulnerable'' at the beginning of this year are located in the
worst drought counties, the report said. And a bank's strength and
performance in 1987 are important in judging how well it could
withstand drought-related losses.
   The report, which was prepared by agency economist Gregory
Gajewski, said that forecasts before the drought indicated 40 to 60
agricultural banks might fail this year, fewer than the 75 failures
in 1987, which was a post-Depression high.
   Farm income nationally is expected to be little affected by the
drought, but farmers in the drought-hit areas will suffer while
others outside of those areas are expected to benefit from higher
commodity prices.
   ``The farmers hit hardest will be unable to meet expenses this
year, including repaying their local banks for farm credit used to
put in this year's aborted crop,'' the report said. ``Banks in the
parched counties will take unexpected hits unless federal programs
rescue the farmers.''
   Legislation providing emergency drought relief for farmers is
currently working its way through Congress.
   ``About 80 percent of the nation's agricultural banks in drought
counties with above-average probabilities of failure are in the
north-central drought region,'' the report said. ``Agricultural
banks in the region's drought counties had a lower return on equity
and a higher proportion of delinquent loans than did banks in
nearby counties not hit by the drought.''

   A proposal by the Agriculture Department would
require foreign countries selling meat and poultry to the United
States to be certified annually that their programs to control drug
contamination meet U.S. standards.
   The proposal ``responds to the requirements'' of the 1985 farm
law, said Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, or FSIS.
   Under the plan, the agency would certify that each country _ 34
now are eligible to ship meat and poultry into the United States _
use reliable analytical methods to determine whether products
contain residues of drugs or other chemicals that are within U.S.
limits.
   ``For many years, we have required foreign countries that export
meat and poultry to the United States to have a system of
inspection that is equal to our domestic inspection system,''
Crawford said Wednesday.
   He added: ``In recent years, the legal requirements governing
how we regulate imported meat and poultry have become increasingly
strict, especially with respect to oversight of residue-control
programs.''
   The proposal would provide that if a country's program was not
certified, the country would lose its eligibility to ship meat and
poultry to the United States.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent through Sept. 26 to:
Policy Office, Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3171-S, USDA,
Washington, D.C. 20250.

   Too much rain has slowed this summer's grain
harvest in the Soviet Union, according to an Agriculture Department
report.
   ``Rains accompanied by strong winds reportedly have caused
lodging (tangling), impeding the early grain harvest in European
U.S.S.R. this year,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said Wednesday. ``Despite the unfavorable conditions, some areas
are reporting excellent winter grain yields.''
   As of July 18, grain and pulses, which include peas and beans,
had been cut on 14.9 million hectares, of which 9.8 million had
been threshed, the report said. That was below the four-year
average of 23.5 million hectares cut and 18.6 million harvested by
this time in 1983-86.
   Even so, harvest progress is ahead of the year-ago pace when the
season was late and only 8.9 million hectares were cut and 5.4
million harvested by now, the report said.
   In all, the Soviet Union has around 116 million hectares for
harvest this year. One hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres.
   The 1987 Soviet grain harvest went on to produce an estimated
211.4 million metric tons, and this year's has been forecast by
USDA at 215 million tons, one of the largest on record.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

<HEAD>Grosz Says Visit Reflects `New Era of Detente'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz
is ending his ground-breaking visit to Washington today, calling it
symbolic of the ``new era of detente'' and expressing hope that it
will produce economic benefits for his country.
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Grosz called the visit _
the first by a Hungarian leader in 42 years _ ``an outstanding
event in our relations.''
   Grosz spoke a few hours after a meeting with President Reagan,
who said he was encouraged by the Hungarian leader's recognition
that his economic reform program ``cannot succeed unless
accompanied by political reforms as well.''
   Reagan also praised Grosz for his ``openness to new ideas.''
   Grosz was to leave this morning aboard a U.S. presidential
aircraft for Niagara Falls, N.Y. During his U.S. stay, he also
visited Illinois, California and New York City.
   He described the current era of detente as ``much richer'' and
``much deeper'' than the comparable period of the 1970's.
   At 57, Grosz is from the same generation as Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his reform program has many similarities
to the Soviet experiment.
   Speaking through a translator at the Hungarian Embassy, Grosz
said the accommodating atmosphere between East and West ``provides
not only the superpowers but the small and medium-sized powers with
the opportunity to participate in a dialogue.''
   The visit was the first ever by a Hungarian party leader since
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago. Grosz became
premier a year ago and was named party chief in May.
   During his visit, the administration agreed to allow Hungary to
open a trade office on the West Coast and promised to study the
possibility of improving the access of Hungarian products to
American markets, Grosz said.
   Reflecting Hungary's greater willingness to accept foreign
private investment, Grosz took part in a ceremony last week at
which an Illinois glass manufacturer and a Hungarian enterprise
agreed to undertake a $115 million joint venture.
   He said a number of other U.S. firms expressed interest in
investing in Hungary as well.
   Administration officials have said Hungary still cannot receive
high technoloy U.S. products because the country is a member of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   On human rights, the officials have praised the freedom with
which Hungary allows its citizens to travel abroad but said there
are still sharp restrictions on protest demonstrations and other
forms of dissent.

<HEAD>Plane In Fatal Crash Linked To Drug Running</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cargo plane that crashed last week in
Louisiana, killing three crew members, previously was used to
deliver drugs to Michigan and has been linked to deliveries of aid
to the Contras, a TV station reported Wednesday.
   The four-engine DC-6 plane, which crashed July 20 about 50 miles
south of New Orleans, had been used in a $45 million delivery of
cocaine and marijuana to Grosse Ile, a community near Detroit,
WXYZ-TV reported.
   The station, citing information gained from the federal
government through the Freedom of Information Act, said the plane
was owned by Michael Palmer, an official with Vortex, an aircraft
sales and leasing company that has been linked to shipments of aid
to the Contras, the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.
   The aircraft was being leased for the flight from San Salvador,
El Salvador, to New Orleans by TACA, a Salvadoran airline.
   It was carrying 22,000 pounds of assorted cargo when it crashed
into a drainage canal, officials said.
   Cargo included seafood, handicrafts, lingerie, plants and
electronics, according to Gary Mascaro, TACA cargo manager at the
New Orleans International Airport.
   TACA said the plane was owned by Universal Air Equipment Leasing
Inc. of Miami and was operated by Fiorelli Crews of Miami. The
three men killed were from Miami.
   Palmer, an official with Vortex, told a Senate hearing in April
that he flew supplies to the Contras under a $96,000 contract
awarded in early 1986 by the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance
Office, part of the State Department.
   Palmer testified at the time that he never worked for the CIA.
   Records from the State Department office show Vortex was one of
about a half-dozen air freight companies used by the State
Department and was first contracted for deliveries on Jan. 10, 1986.
   The Washington Post has reported that Vortex delivered
non-lethal aid directly to the Contras inside Nicaragua on three or
four flights.
   The plane, which has had a number of different identifying tail
numbers, was seized briefly by federal agents in September 1987
after it arrived at Grosse Ile Municipal Airport with a load of
drugs.
   Palmer, a pilot who was on board the plane at the time of the
bust, said he was acting as a government informant to help federal
officials catch drug runners.

   In the realm of national politics, where flash
and style hold sway, quiet Nancy Kassebaum has made it onto the
list of Republican vice presidential prospects through dogged study
and subtle strengths.
   The second-term Kansas senator dismisses talk of herself as a
running mate for George Bush in the fall campaign, saying she
doesn't think she offers the proper balance _ ``in personality'' _
that Bush will want on the ticket.
   But it is her strengths, cultivated over nearly a decade in the
Senate, that apparently have brought the diminutive former Wichita
housewife and businesswoman to the attention of Bush's advisers.
   On issues she chooses to dig into _ including foreign policy,
national defense, the budget, transportation and agriculture _
Kassebaum spends long hours marshaling facts and mulling over
arguments before taking a position. Once taken, those positions are
unshakable, as the Reagan administration has occasionally come to
learn.
   Testifying this past spring before the GOP platform committee in
Kansas City, Mo., she spoke out firmly for the need to consider tax
increases as a weapon, along with spending cuts, in the fight
against the federal deficit. That puts her potentially at odds with
Bush, who has vowed never to raise personal income taxes.
   ``There is no way that we can cut $150 billion to $200 billion
out of the federal budget,'' she stated, with unusual bluntness.
``To promise to do so is to engage in fantasy.''
   Despite such principled stands, Kassebaum has few political
enemies. She has an unassuming personal charm and an explosive
smile that disarm opponents. And she eschews political gamesmanship
and gimmicks designed to gain publicity, a determination which has
gained her respect among colleagues while keeping her out of the
limelight.
   Bush strategists may see in Kassebaum a way of offsetting a
potential weakness for their candidate, what some pollsters have
referred to as Bush's ``gender gap.'' Kassebaum comes in for almost
automatic consideration as the only Republican woman in the Senate
and one of a handful of GOP women with national standing.
   While sympathetic to so-called women's issues _ Kassebaum
supports women's right to have an abortion and was a proponent of
the Equal Rights Amendment _ she is uncomfortable leading the
charge on those matters.
   Weighing against her selection as the vice presidential
candidate are the small size of her home state _ Kansas has just
seven electoral votes _ and a lack of identification beyond the
state's borders. Political observers doubt Kassebaum could bring to
the ticket a Midwest regional appeal based on farm and rural
interests in the same way her Kansas colleague, Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, did as Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976.
   Another potential minus is her soft-spoken, undynamic style, a
drawback she has conceded. Seldom a participant in Senate floor
debates, she prefers to play to her strength, one-on-one dealings
with colleagues.
   The idea of Kassebaum on the short list for the No. 2 spot is
taken seriously enough by the Republican right wing that it was
blasted as ``high-stakes skirt chasing'' in the conservative
weekly, Human Events.
   The article attacked her pro-choice stand on abortion and warned
that she would alienate the party's conservative wing, which
already has doubts about Bush's claim to the Reagan legacy.
Kassebaum's lifetime 52 percent rating from the American
Conservative Union puts her in the bottom one-fourth of GOP
senators, it noted.
   During a spring visit to California to campaign for the
re-election of Sen. Pete Wilson, Kassebaum was greeted by
Bush-Kassebaum bumper stickers. While flattered, she later brushed
the gesture aside.
   ``There is a bumper sticker in Washington somewhere that says,
`Honk if George Bush has asked you to be vice president,''' she
said.
   ``I don't anticipate it being offered to me. I don't think it's
the right balance, and I think I tend to have pretty good political
instincts.''

   If Joel Brandon spends a lot of time puckering
up, it's only natural _ after all, whistling's his work.
   What some professional whistlers don't find natural, though, is
the way Brandon whistles. He inhales, rather than exhales, to
produce his tones.
   ``I also sort of pop the notes off with my tongue a lot of the
time to get a more staccato effect than most whistlers use,''
Brandon said Wednesday. He does Bach and Handel pieces and jazz
improvisation and will perform with the Houston Symphony next year.
   Brandon, 40, won the 10th International Whistle-Off contest in
Carson City, Nev., earlier this year and won the championship of
the National Whistlers' Convention in Louisburg, N.C., for a second
year in a row.
   He says he learned his unusual inhalation technique by accident
while walking on the street on Chicago's South Side when he was 7
or 8 years old.
   ``I was whistling, and I inhaled and made a sound I'd never made
before,'' he said.
   For a long time, Brandon studied flute at the American
Conservatory of Music, but finally realized there were a lot of
flute players, and only one master inhale-whistler.
   So, for the past 10 years, he has made his living strictly by
whistling.

   A Tulsa woman's sour experience with import
quotas finally turned into a sweet deal, but it was only a
coincidence.
   A convention of cake bakers is coming to town next month and
June Melendy tried to pick up some special sugar, syrup and
molasses shipped by two British decorators. But U.S. Customs
officials at Tulsa's International Airport stopped the pick up,
saying sugar imports were over their quotas.
   ``They're artists,'' Ms. Melendy said of cake decorating experts
Elaine MacGregor and Nicolas Lodge of Sussex, England, who had
shipped the supplies in preparation for the Aug. 11-14 convention
expected to draw 1,500 cake decorators.
   ``They use a very fine, extra-refined sugar. They don't like our
sugar. They're just like a sculptor or painter. They prefer using
their own equipment.''
   Art finally prevailed Wednesday, even though the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said it was strictly business. The department
decided to relax sugar import quotas in a decision unrelated to Ms.
Melendy's dilemma, said Charles Conroy, spokesman for the Customs
Service in Houston.
   Conroy said officials determined that more sugar could be
imported this year without injury to the domestic market. ``It just
happened to work out to her advantage that way,'' he said.
   Ms. Melendy, a spokeswoman for the International Cake
Exploration Society's Convention and Cake Show, said she was going
to move fast retrieving the 88-pound box held since July 19.
   ``I'm going to run back out there and get my sugar before they
change their minds,'' she said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Drought Eases In Some Areas, But West Still Dry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the most drought-parched areas of the
country received a good dousing last week, the National Weather
Service said in a generally optimistic assessment of conditions.
   ``Rainfall for the past week was substantial in the driest
areas,'' the weather service said Wednesday in its latest drought
advisory. The report said more than one inch of rainfall from West
Virginia westward into Missouri had fallen and said it has been the
most beneficial precipitation since early April.
   But the report said extreme conditions still prevail in the
West, the northern Plains and the Rockies.
   Some locations received more than eight inches of rain, with a
few areas having the equivalent of two months of normal rainfall,
the advisory said.
   The five-day forecast through Aug. 1 calls for some heavy rain
across Florida and along the Gulf Coast, with widely scattered
thundershowers along the East Coast.
   But the agency said generally hot and dry conditions will spread
to the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.
   Normal rainfall is forecast for the second week in August in the
lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast, with near normal or
below normal temperatures. But above normal temperatures were
predicted for the Northeast and the Ohio Valley.
   Rainfall caused the level of creeks, streams and rivers
throughout the Ohio Valley, the middle and lower Mississippi Valley
and the Northeast to rise temporarily.
   But streamflows across the rest of the country were still very
low, according to the Hydrological Services division of the agency.
   Some reservoirs reported increased storage levels, the report
said, and water-use restrictions remained in effect in some parts
of the country.
   Temperatures across the Great Plains dropped from three degrees
to six degrees below normal, although temperatures remained as much
as nine degrees above normal along the West Coast.
   Record high temperatures were still being reported in the
Pacific Northwest and from Montana to Minnesota, the service said.
   Extreme dry conditions continued to increase the danger of fire
in the far West and the northern plains and the Rockies, the
service added.
   The report said 12 percent of the country slipped into the
extreme drought category between mid-June and mid-July, with about
45 percent of the country affected by July 16.
   The nation's worst recorded drought was in 1934 when 61 percent
of the country was put in the extreme category.

   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing
use of a no-calorie sweetener as a table sugar substitute and
ingredient in some food products.
   The substance, acesulfame potassium, was developed in West
Germany and is used in 20 other countries as an additive in various
pharmaceutical products, some baked goods and candies, the Food and
Drug Administration said Wednesday.
   Regulations permitting use of the sweetener, to be marketed in
the United States as ``Sunette,'' take effect upon publication in
the Federal Register today.
   The FDA is allowing its use in chewing gum, dry beverage mixes,
instant coffee, instant tea, gelatins, puddings and non-dairy
creamers.
   However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
consumer interest group, told the FDA it was concerned that the
sweetener may have caused tumors found in laboratory animals.
   But the FDA said the tumors were ``what could routinely be
expected'' and not due to feeding with Sunette.
   Sunette is a product of the Hoechst Celanese Corp. of
Somerville, N.J., a subsidiary of Hoechst AG of Frankfurt, West
Germany. The company did not seek FDA approval to use Sunette in
soft drinks.
   The FDA deferred action on the company's request to use the
sweetener in candies and other confections in the United States.
   In the past the agency has interpreted the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act as barring the use of non-nutritive sweeteners in
candies.
   Sunette is said to be 200 times sweeter than sugar. It joins
saccharin, another no-calorie sweetener, and the low-calorie sugar
substitute aspartame on the U.S. market.

<HEAD>FBI Link to Stolen Documents to be Probed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI files have turned up documents stolen from a
television reporter who has accused U.S. officials in a Nicaraguan
political bombing, but the agency denies knowing the material was
taken illegally.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the FBI oversight
committee in Congress, said he will look promptly into how the
agency obtained the stolen documents from Tony Avirgan, a
free-lance cameraman who worked for CBS-TV.
   ``We've been looking into over 100 break-ins over a period of
several years,'' Edwards said Wednesday. ``They all have a Central
American angle, all relating to Salvador, in some cases Nicaragua.''
   The FBI confirmed a report in The Boston Globe on Wednesday that
the agency received memos and notes taken in Costa Rica in 1985 and
1986 from Avirgan, who was investigating a political bombing in
Nicaragua that killed eight people and left him slightly injured.
   Avirgan and his wife, Martha Honey, later filed a $24 million
damage suit in Miami federal court accusing U.S. and Nicaraguan
Contra officials of responsibility for the bombing. The suit was
dismissed last month for insufficient evidence.
   The FBI obtained Avirgan's files from someone reporting on
people who allegedly supported ``terrorist operations in Central
America,'' according to a statement released through Washington FBI
spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer.
   ``This individual gave no indication that the documents were
obtained through illegal means,'' the statement said.
   Schnitzer said the FBI routinely inquires if such material is
stolen, but refused to say if that was done in the Avirgan case.
She also refused to identify the source.
   The FBI will cooperate with an investigation by appropriate
oversight committees, Ms. Schnitzer said.
   The 39 pages stolen from Avirgan included memos to CBS and
Avirgan's handwritten notes about the bombing, said Lanny Sinkin,
an attorney for the liberal, Washington-based Christic Institute,
which represents Avirgan in the Miami lawsuit.
   ``It suggests that the break-in was targeted to find out what he
knew,'' said Sinkin.
   The subject of many of the stolen memos, and later Avirgan's
damage lawsuit, was the May 1984 bombing of a news conference held
by maverick Contra commander Eden Pastora in La Penca, Nicaragua,
just across the Costa Rican border.
   Three journalists and five Pastora supporters died in the
explosion, although Pastora was only slightly injured. Avirgan and
later the Christic Institute blamed it on U.S. and Contra leaders
who objected to Pastora's independent stance in the fight against
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Edwards said the documents indicate that the FBI ``could have
been getting the fruits of political burglaries and break-ins.''
   Also Wednesday, Chris Wood, a Montpelier, Vt., political
activist who has been involved in the Vermont Central America
Non-Intervention Network, said he has been the target of three
break-ins in three weeks that he suspects involved the FBI.
   Ray McElhaney, another FBI spokesman in Washington, said, ``I
don't think there have been any break-ins involving the FBI. ... I
have no statement regarding the allegations of this person in
Montpelier, Vermont.''
   Last month, the Globe reported that the FBI has conducted at
least four investigations of opponents of the Reagan
administration's Central American policies, including CISPES, the
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
   The thefts at Avirgan's home in 1985 and about a year later were
reported to Costa Rican police at the time, but no one was ever
arrested, Sinkin said.
   During preparations for the lawsuit, attorneys routinely asked
for any documents the FBI Washington office might have on Avirgan,
and the agency responded last month.
   ``As we went through them, it became clear they were stolen from
Tony's home,'' Sinkin said.
   Avirgan filed his lawsuit here in 1986, but last month Chief
U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King threw the case out, saying
there was insufficient evidence.
   Avirgan and the institute last week gave notice they would
appeal King's ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   Some cynics might call it a Mickey Mouse
operation, but drought-beleaguered Iowans say they're honored to
help the world's most famous rodent celebrate his 60th birthday
with a cornfield seeded in his image.
   The ``birthday card'' devised by Walt Disney Productions is a
520-acre field in north central Iowa, planted in corn and oats in a
profile of the cartoon legend that's visible from 30,000 feet in
the air.
   The presentation is scheduled for Aug. 6-7, and the celebration
is the latest in a series of events surrounding the farm field art
that has brought cheer to some Iowa communities struggling under
the farm crisis of the 1980s and, lately, the drought.
   This time, it also may bring in some cash for economic
development and community groups.
   Walt Disney Productions characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse, as
well as Donald Duck and Goofy, all are scheduled to appear at the
fair in Sheffield along with ``Ear Force One,'' a 12-story-high hot
air balloon in the shape of Mickey's head and featuring a birthday
hat.
   Organizers say the celebration could attract more than 40,000
people, providing an economic lift to the seven small communities,
known as the Area Community Commonwealth, that surround the field.
   ``With the distressed economic environment and this year's
drought, this is bringing smiles to peoples' faces,'' says
Sheffield banker Keith Lazer. ``This is one ray of hope.''
   Last fall, as Mickey's 60th birthday approached, the Disney
organization began working in Iowa to locate a field to plant in
the shape of his head, preferably one beneath a well-traveled route
of commercial airliners.
   With the help of Iowa State University, searchers found a farm
that fit the bill, property rented by Richard Pitzenberger and his
sons Joe, Ted and Rick.
   Using a design developed with the help of a surveyor, Joe
Pitzenberger planted corn in the shape of Mickey's head surrounded
by oats in a day and a half last spring. He said it took just three
hours longer than usual to plant the field, which has been kept
alive by rain that has eluded some other areas of the state.
   The design consists of 6.5 million corn plants surrounded by 300
acres of oats, and it's 1.1 miles from the tip of Mickey's nose to
the end of his ear, said Disneyland spokeswoman LouAnne Cappiello.
   ``It's been great,'' said Joe Pitzenberger of the attention his
work has achieved, although he admits that the famous field mouse
also is making the Pitzenbergers' the butt of some good-natured
jokes around town.
   ``Mickey Mouse operation is the one we hear the most,'' said
Pitzenberger. ``I tell 'em I've heard it before.''
   Lazar said the fair will have the usual food booths, games and
concessions and will also feature a parade, a chance to have
pictures taken with Disney characters and helicopter rides to view
the fields.
   In addition, the Disney organization is providing buttons and
balloons, and organizers hope to sell thousands of souvenirs, with
hats priced at $5 and T-shirts at $7, Lazar said.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. war veterans driving 20 vehicles
loaded with food, clothing and medical supplies have arrived in
Nicaragua on the final leg of a journey their government resisted.
   The Veterans' Peace Convoy, comprised of 44 people, crossed the
border from Honduras late Wednesday, Don Reasoner, a leading member
of the Committee of U.S. Citizens Living In Nicaragua, said in a
telephone interview.
   The Committee opposes President Reagan's policies in Central
America.
   The U.S. government blocked the convoy from leaving the United
States at least three times, saying plans to leave the trucks in
Nicaragua violated a 3-year-old trade embargo against the leftist
Sandinista government.
   Washington has backed the Contra rebels, who have been fighting
the Sandinistas.
   Eight of the veterans group's members were arrested July 9 when
they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a Rio
Grande bridge crossing in Laredo, Texas.
   The group finally crossed the Mexican border at Nuevo Laredo on
July 14.
   The presentation of the food and medical supplies carried by the
veterans is to take place Friday in the capital.
   The U.S. Treasury Department accepted that the food and medical
supplies carried by the group qualified as humanitarian aid, exempt
from the 1985 embargo. But it said the vehicles were barred from
remaining in Nicaragua.
   The U.S. Customs Service said the trucks must return to the
United States within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of
up to $50,000 and 10 years in prison. Convoy members refused to
sign forms promising they would return the trucks.
   In June, the original convoy of 38 vehicles was stopped by U.S.
Customs officials from crossing into Mexico. About 100 participants
in the convoy drove to Washington, D.C. to rally against Customs'
decision, circling around the White House and in front of the State
Department in three days of protest.

   Their two-day strike broken by the
government, hundreds of train crews returned to work today and
brought service back to normal, officials of the state-run railroad
said.
   Police said all but a dozen of the 1,463 strikers and their
relatives arrested during protests at stations and railway
facilities were freed after the strikers agreed to return to work.
   The remaining 12 jailed employees of the Korean National
Railroad face formal charges of neglecting their duty, police said.
   Engineers and other employees walked off the job Tuesday to
demand higher pay and shorter hours. The government said the strike
was illegal.
   The railroad said the strike disrupted about 90 percent of
normal daily service of 2,050 trains and affected more than 1
million passengers.
   The strikers demanded that work hours be reduced from an average
245 hours to 144 hours a month. They also wanted a doubling of
their living and other allowances.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae said a government offer that the
strikers had rejected would take effect, cutting regular monthly
work hours to 224 and increasing allowances from the current $100
to $138 a month.
   Engineers with 10 years' experience now make about $1,200 a
month, including allowances.

<HEAD>B-1B Able To Perform Only Half Its Intended Tasks, Pentagon Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force is scaling back its expectations
for the B-1B bomber after concluding it will probably be able to
only half the job it was designed for, the director of testing for
the Defense Department says.
   John E. Krings told a meeting of two House Armed Services
subcommittees that the new plane, already behind schedule, has
problems in the electronic equipment that enables it to fly close
to the ground and avoid or confuse enemy radar.
   ``It will accomplish about 50 percent in terms of the gross
assessment of what it was supposed to do,'' he testified on
Wednesday.
   Because of the problems combatting radar, the Air Force is
focusing on a narrower range of threats for the 100 B-1Bs it is
buying, hoping to develop reliable performance against enemy
anti-aircraft weapons, he said. ``It's better to have success in a
limited area than no success in a large area,'' he told the panels.

   NASA needs to build a system to more
accurately predict weather conditions at the moment spacecraft are
launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a new study says.
   The study by the National Research Council released Wednesday
analyzed the system used by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to protect its spacecraft from lightning and other
adverse weather. It concluded that major improvements are needed in
organization and in instruments.
   NASA, the panel said, ``has been poorly organized to provide
weather support and the result is a system that is less than
state-of-the-science,'' the report said. It said unless
improvements in the weather forecasting system are made at the
Kennedy center, ``weather will loom larger as a threat to a
rejuvenated and accelerated space flight program.''
   John A. Ernst, director of NASA's weather support office, said
the space agency asked for the study and has taken ``some initial
steps'' on the recommendations.

<HEAD>Palestinian Leader Calls For Talks With Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent pro-PLO leader from the occupied
territories called for direct talks with Israeli representatives
and said he would even speak with hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   In a rare dialogue with Israeli peace activists, Faisal Husseini
said the Palestinians' ``dream'' is to have Israel as well as the
occupied lands, but they are willing to compromise and split the
land to end the ``nightmares.''
   ``As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis _ so I must
speak with them,'' Husseini said Wednesday. ``So we're willing to
speak with Shamir, not because he is a a man of peace ... but
because we know this man was chosen by Israel to represent them.''
   As he spoke, dozens of anti-Arab demonstrators stood outside and
protested against the forum, sponsored by the broad-based Israeli
peace movement, Peace Now. The Palestine Liberation Organization is
banned in Israel, and the protesters held signs saying, ``Peace Now
is a knife in the back.''
   The PLO refuses to recognize Israel, but a recent document drawn
up by PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif called for direct talks with
Israel under the auspices of an international conference.
   The document was criticized by extremist factions of the PLO.
   Husseini is a popular figure among residents of the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin once called him the leading PLO representative in the areas.
He seemed to back Abu Sharif's policy.
   Israeli listeners asked him whether Palestinians will be
satisfied with a state alongside Israel and not try to conquer the
Jewish state itself.
   ``Indeed, I do have a dream,'' he said.
   ``But I am not willing to impose my dreams upon my fellow men,''
he said. ``We will have to give up a lot of dreams _ but also a lot
of nightmares.''
   The statements were greeted with loud applause.
   Husseini, director of the East Jerusalem-based Arab Studies
Institute, was released in July from an Israeli jail, where he had
been held without trial for nine months.
   Before the anti-occupation uprising began Dec. 8, he was
involved in clandestine talks with Moshe Amirav, a former member of
the right-wing Likud Party. Likud, which is fiercely opposed to the
PLO, kicked Amirav out of the party over the meetings.
   Amirav, leftist parliamentarian Yair Tzaban and Palestinian
journalist Redwan Abu Ayash, who was also released from jail
without trial recently, addressed the unusual gathering with
Husseini.
   It was the first public dialogue between Israelis and
Palestinians in Israel since the uprising started.
   Tzaban, of the small socialist Mapam party, called on Israel to
acknowledge Palestinian nationalism and negotiate with Palestinian
representatives. He lashed out at Labor party leader Shimon Peres
for speaking as though Israel could simply return the territories
to Jordan.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
War.
   In recent weeks, Peres has indicated Israel will speak to the
Palestinians if Jordan's King Hussein is not willing to come to the
negotiating table.
   ``Israel doesn't even need peace with Jordan,'' Tzaban said.
``Israel needs peace with the Palestinians, and you can't get that
by negotiating with Swedes, Americans, Norwegians or Jordanians _
only by negotiating with the Palestinians.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Stuff Drought Bill With Goodies for Homefolks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are stuffing their $6.9 billion
drought-relief bill full of election-year goodies for the folks
back home, and some of the handouts don't even have anything to do
with the drought.
   One provision would provide $24 million to cotton growers in the
district of Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, whose crops were damaged
by hail in 1987.
   Now, Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., is saying it would be wrong to
confine 1987 hail payments to Texas cotton.
   ``In my district it would be very unfair to the dry edible bean
people, to the sugar beet people, to the potato people,'' she said
Wednesday. She wants to expand the benefits to $40 million.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
says the same kind of scramble would have occurred even if there
were no elections coming up in November.
   ``Every year is basically an election year in this place,'' he
said. ``It happens all the time. Every time you have a bill like
this every member becomes provincial and protective of his
interests.''
   Lawmakers say fiscal watchdogs have nothing to complain about as
long as the aid does not exceed the $7.5 billion in farm program
savings that economists believe will be generated by the drought.
   The bill's major provision would furnish farmers with payments
equal to 65 percent of earnings lost because of damage to crops in
excess of 35 percent of expected yield. It also would provide
expanded government feed benefits to dairy and livestock producers.
   But that only scratches the surface.
   Under heavy debate is a provision to increase the dairy price
support level by 50 cents for each hundred pounds of milk. This
boon for milk producers and dairy cooperatives is the brainchild of
Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who is running for the Senate from a
state that is a major source of the East Coast's milk supply.
   Jeffords says the action, which would raise consumer prices by a
few cents a gallon, is needed for avert milk shortages.
   Critics scoff at that claim, citing government forecasts of
ample milk. But Jeffords stands his ground.
   ``It is our duty to assure an adequate supply of milk,'' he
declares.
   If his plan falters, an alternative that would make the increase
temporary is being sponsored by Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and
Tim Penny, D-Minn.
   The Senate, pushing its own version, has incorporated a
provision that would aid manufacturers of ethanol, the alcohol fuel
made in part from corn.
   It would allow ethanol makers to buy government surplus corn at
110 percent of the price the Agriculture Department paid. Much of
the surplus was acquired long before drought sent prices zooming.
   The provision could mean a government subsidy of as much as $2
million a month for domestic ethanol manufacturers, including the
Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., which makes the lion's
share of domestic ethanol.
   But Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the sponsor, says the idea is to
provide corn to a variety of small ethanol companies in danger of
going broke.
   ``ADM doesn't even want this amendment,'' Daschle said. He said
a $2 million benefit would represent ``a small fraction of what
their capacity is to produce.''
   He said junking the plan could actually help ADM, which is a
hefty contributor to campaigns of Agriculture Committee members _
Daschle included.
   ``You know what they'd get if they don't get this?'' said
Daschle. ``As I understand it, if all these small plants closed,
they'd (ADM) get all the business.''
   When the House was first drafting its bill a few weeks ago, Rep.
Harley O. Staggers Jr., D-W.Va., tacked on a provision to allow the
secretary of agriculture, on a discretionary basis, to pay half of
seeding costs for drought-burned pastures.
   But as the Agriculture Committee was putting finishing touches
on the bill, Rep. Claude Harris, D-Ala., won approval of a change
that would flatly require the government to pay half of the bills.
   The measure also could prove a boon to the fertilizer industry
because 50 percent of fertilizer costs would be paid under the
Harris amendment. De la Garza called for junking the plan after
staff economists estimated a $1.2 billion price tag.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Schuette, R-Mich., is planning an amendment
that would provide federal loan guarantees for drought-stricken
farmers. He says he is still unsure of the price tag.
   ``Would it cover peach orchards? Would it cover apple
orchards?'' Rep. Delbert Latta, R-Ohio, asked at Wednesday's Rules
Committee session.
   That there is something for almost everything in the bill became
clear when de la Garza was asked exactly which types of livestock
would be covered by the measure's feed provisions. He thought for a
moment and then, smiling broadly, said:
   ``Cows to catfish and anything in between.''

<HEAD>Lyng Urges Drought Lawmakers: Drop $300 Million Boon for Dairy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is speeding $6.9 billion in drought
assistance toward President Reagan's desk, with Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng calling on lawmakers to jettison a $300
million benefit for milk producers.
   ``We strongly object to the provision which would increase the
price support level for milk and urge the House to strike this
provision from the bill on the floor,'' Lyng said Wednesday.
   In a letter to House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika''
de la Garza, D-Texas, the secretary dismissed dairy industry claims
that the price boost is needed to head off a looming milk shortage.
And he placed the cost of the increase at $300 million _ more than
double the House estimate.
   ``We do not expect milk shortages next year,'' Lyng said as both
the House and Senate prepared to act on their versions of the
measure to provide aid to farmers hard hit by the drought.
   Farm lawmakers plan to meet in a House-Senate conference
committee next week to fashion the final product and send it to
Reagan before Aug. 11, when Congress flees Washington's summer heat.
   At the core of both versions is a payment program that would
provide drought-stricken farmers with compensation equal to 65
percent of crop losses beyond 35 percent of their expected harvest.
The plan also would streamline and expand federal feed benefits for
dairy and livestock producers.
   Under heavy fire from the Reagan administration _ and a host of
rival farm and business groups _ is a House provision that would
increase the dairy price support level on Oct. 1 by 50 cents for
each 100 pounds of milk to $11.10.
   Both bills would cancel a 50-cent cut in the price-support level
that otherwise would be automatic under the farm program.
   Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., sponsor of the increase, and Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, have been urging the idea as a way of
heading off a milk shortage next year.
   Anticipating an intense fight over the Jeffords provision, dairy
supporters have readied a fallback provision that would put in
place a temporary price-support increase. The plan sponsored by
Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and Tim Penny, D-Minn., was
reportedly gaining steam in the House.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a persistent critic of
excess spending on agricultural programs, called for barring
farmers with $1 million in revenue from receiving drought benefits
provided by the legislation.
   ``I'm suggesting that if they are that successful they probably
don't need a subsidy,'' the Brooklyn lawmaker said. Schumer said
his amendment would deny benefits to farmers if their gross
revenues totaled $1 million, even if their net earnings were far
less.
   Under the relief bill, payments would be made for losses of a
wide variety of crops, including an estimated $150 million for
tobacco.
   Tobacco-state lawmakers acknowledged that it thus represented a
step away from the 1983 compromise between farm lawmakers and
anti-smoking forces under which the tobacco price-support system is
supposed to have no net cost to the taxpayer.
   ``It's because of the special situation of the drought,'' said
Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., chairman of the House tobacco and
peanuts subcommittee.
   ``To be providing $150 million because a crop that kills people
is damaged and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating
people about the hazards of tobacco is really an example of having
priorities upside down,'' said John F. Banzhaf II, director of
Action on Smoking and Health, one of the nation's major
anti-smoking organizations.

<HEAD>NBC-Journal Poll Finds 18-Point Dukakis Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
boosted his lead over George Bush to 18 points following the
Democratic National Convention, according to a new poll.
   The results of the NBC News-Wall Street Journal national survey
released Wednesday showed Dukakis with his biggest lead of the
campaign and followed similar results in polls conducted in the
afterglow of the Democratic convention.
   Dukakis drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for Bush in the
survey of 1,770 registered voters. Dukakis had led by 10 points,
46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll.
   The national nominating conventions often provide candidates a
boost in the polls, especially when the conventions proceed as
harmoniously as the Democrats' did last week. The bounce usually
settles as the race proceeds.
   The newest survey has a margin of error of 3 percentage points
in either direction.

   Republican National Committee Chairman
Frank Fahrenkopf predicted in a televised interview that the 1988
presidential race ``could be one of the most negative campaigns in
U.S. history.''
   Fahrenkopf made the comment when asked Wednesday about Democrat
Michael Dukakis' claim that Americans are ``embarrassed and
ashamed'' by the Reagan administration.
   ``People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' said
Fahrenkopf. ``The Democrats don't have a lock on honesty in
government any more than our party does, and the American people
know that.''
   Fahrenkopf said that if Dukakis is so upset about conduct of top
Republicans such as resigned Attorney General Edwin Meese III, the
Democratic should also call for the resignation of such prominent
Democrats as House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.

<DATELINE>EXMOUTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy sailor killed his wife by
throwing her into shark-infested waters off the Indian Ocean, a
military prosecutor told an American court-martial.
   Petty Officer Charles Wayne Elmore, 26, of Texas, is charged
with premeditated murder in the the March 1988 death of his
Philippines-born wife, Bella Fe. Elmore, who is stationed in
Exmouth, has pleaded innocent.
   Military officials refused to release Elmore's hometown.
   A judge and jury, all U.S. military officers, flew in for the
trial, the first court-martial for an American in Australia since
World War II.
   In her opening statement Wednesday, government prosecutor Lt.
Cmdr. Philemina Jones acknowledged the case was circumstantial
because no trace of the body was recovered.
   ``There is, simply, nothing left of Mrs. Elmore,'' the
prosecutor said.
   Ms. Jones said Elmore's statements changed as investigators
questioned him about the March 16 disappearance.
   Ms. Jones said she would prove Elmore and his wife argued and
then drove to the Exmouth Naval Pier, 500 miles north of Perth,
where ``somehow she just fell and rolled off the pier into the
water.''
   ``Instead of going to help her, Elmore went home and went to
bed,'' Jones said. ``He figured his wife could swim back to the end
of the pier and walk the 10 miles back home.''
   Ms. Jones said she would produce 38 witnesses and evidence about
marital problems, including testimony that Elmore, after drinking,
was overheard to say he would like to cut up his wife and throw her
to the sharks.
   ``It is something he had been planning ever since he decided he
was sorry he married her,'' Ms. Jones said. ``This was a
premeditated murder of his wife _ a wife he had grown tired of.''
   Jones said that because of Elmore's work as a boatswain's mate,
he knew about tides in the area and that the waters were
shark-infested.
   ``That is why he was so sure he would never see Bella again,''
she said.
   The case is continuing.

<TEXT>
   A newlywed says she and her husband were
``blinded by love'' 3{ months ago when they disappeared from
Chicago, sparking a manhunt after their deserted car was found
ransacked with its engine running.
   Scott Swanson, 23, and his wife, Carolyn, 22, said they dashed
off to San Diego shortly after they eloped because some relatives
apparently disapproved of their skipping a traditional marriage
ceremony. They also said they just wanted to spend time together.
   ``Call it shortsighted or call it what you want to, but love is
blind and I know that sounds trite,'' Ms. Swanson said at a news
conference after being reunited with her parents, Jim and Kathy
MacLean of Haddonfield, N.J.
   ``So much has come out of it that has been great, but then to
see the look on my mother's face ... and my dad's face. ... I mean,
I can't stand the hurt that I've caused,'' she said tearfully.
   The newlyweds vanished April 2 without telling relatives or
classmates at a suburban Evangelical college.
   During a resulting three-state police investigation, friends at
Wheaton College held prayer vigils, put up posters and questioned
people at roadside restaurants and gas stations.
   ``We are tremendously sorry for the hurt and the pain we've
caused to our families, to our friends and loved ones and
relatives,'' Swanson said. ``We never realized that the story would
have the ramifications it has.''
   The couple left their car near a police station with the keys
under the mat and their identification cards, Swanson said. ``We
didn't want to be traced.''
   The BMW was found ransacked in an alley, its motor running.
   Police eventually determined that the couple had planned to
vanish, but families and friends feared foul play.
   The MacLeans said they followed the uproar over their
disappearance through front-page stories in Chicago newspapers at a
university library. Meanwhile, they both got jobs at a suburban La
Jolla delicatessen.
   They were not seen or heard from until they sent letters to
their parents and contacted the MacLeans by telephone Tuesday.
   ``We hoped to let things die down a bit, to let the
investigation settle. Then we could slip in unnoticed,'' Swanson
said.
   ``We were afraid to come back and we felt we had done the right
thing to begin with. We needed to wait on our decision until the
right time within ourselves to come back,'' he said.
   Swanson said his family's reaction to the wedding was in part
responsible for their decision. He said they eloped ``simply for
the spiritualness of it and not for the wedding ... the large
production of it.
   ``We weren't clear-minded why we did what we did, but in the
time of what we did it seemed the best thing to do.''
   His wife said, ``We're so in love and we wanted to get away from
the adornment and the material world and develop our relationship
together apart from that. And we did that and we're so much
stronger as a result of it.''
   Her parents arrived in San Diego on Wednesday afternoon. Swanson
said he had contacted his parents, who were vacationing.
   ``Obviously we're excited and thrilled to be here together,''
said MacLean, standing beside his wife, daughter and son-in-law.
   Asked if he was upset with his daughter and son-in-law, MacLean
said, ``I'm a father. I don't think they ran from us.''
   Chicago Police Cmdr. Ettore DiVito, who headed the
investigation, said police may try to recover the costs of their
efforts.
   ``We are disheartened that we'd expended so many man-hours,'' he
said, but added, ``As far as I know, there is no criminal activity
involved in the case.''
   Swanson said he ``will bear responsibility for all that has
happened.''
   The couple said they weren't sure whether they would return to
Chicago. Swanson had been scheduled to graduate in May. Ms.
Swanson, a junior, was set to graduate in December.
   In Chicago, news of the couple's reappearance shocked but
delighted their friends and those who took part in the police
search, which encompassed parts of Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.
   Randy Brandt said he handed out leaflets in Chicago that sought
leads on the disappearance. He said he wasn't bitter _ just baffled.
   ``That's not the approach I would have taken,'' Brandt said.
``It's definitely unique, though.''

<HEAD>Study Of Fur Mutation In Mice Could Aid Understanding Of Skin
Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation of an unusual genetic
mutation that changes the pigmentation of mice could offer insights
into the development of a deadly form of skin cancer in humans, a
researcher says.
   Murray Brilliant, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar
Harbor, said Wednesday the technique he developed to study the
mutation in mice also could be used to study genetic mutations in
humans.
   ``It's a way to get at many mutations of potential medical
importance to humans,'' said Brilliant.
   The mutation in mice affects the pigmentation of cells called
melanocytes. Studies of the mutation may help explain how
melanocytes develop normally, he said.
   ``You have to know how this works normally to know what goes
wrong in cancer,'' said Brilliant, who did the research in
connection with Eva Eicher, another geneticist at Jackson
Laboratory.
   When the growth of melanocytes goes awry in humans, the result
is melanoma, a skin cancer that is often fatal.
   Furthermore, Brilliant said, the study of the mutation in the
melanocyte pigmentation gene could help researchers understand
other genetic defects.
   ``The information from this line of research is being applied to
gain access to a closely linked gene which, when mutated, causes
cleft palate in mice,'' Brilliant said. Whether that will help
explain the occurrence of cleft palate in humans is not known,
Brilliant said.
   The mutation Brilliant studied in mice is called the pink
unstable mutation. It has the highest mutation rate of any gene
known in mammals.
   Up to one in 10 of the offspring of a parent with the pink
unstable mutation will suffer a new mutation of the gene, Brilliant
said.
   The gene is related to pigmentation in the mice. When the gene
is normal, mice are black. When the gene is mutated, the mice are
cream-colored with pink eyes.
   But one in 10 to one in 40 of the offspring of the
cream-colored, pink-eyed mice will have black patches of fur,
Brilliant said, as the gene mutates again, reverting back to its
original form.
   If such mottled mice are bred again, some of their offspring
will be black as the gene further reverts to its normal form.
   Melanoma is caused by mutations in genes that affect the
development of pigment-carrying cells, and thus these mouse studies
may someday help doctors understand how melanoma arises, Brilliant
said.
   Brilliant studied the mutation using a new technique he
developed in which he looks for variations in repeating pieces of
genetic material that are scattered throughout the mouse's genes.
   Similar examination of repeating pieces of genetic material in
human genes can be used to find genetic mutations in humans, he
said.

   Concern about AIDS has not decreased sexual
activity among unmarried women since 1982, but has helped increased
their use of condoms, a nationwide survey suggests.
   Seventy-six percent of unmarried women ages 18 to 44 were
sexually active last year compared with 71 percent in 1982, the
survey estimates.
   The study was conducted by Jacqueline Darroch Forrest of the
Alan Guttmacher Institute, which studies fertility issues, and
Richard Fordyce of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J.
   It appears in the current issue of the institute's publication,
``Family Planning Perspectives.''
   The paper says the estimates should be accurate within 2
percentage points, but Forrest said that estimates of sexual
activity may be low.
   The researchers compared 1982 and 1987 nationwide surveys
commissioned by Ortho. The surveys asked a variety of questions
about contraception and included married and unmarried women.
   For 1987, questionnaires were completed by 60 percent of
unmarried women who received them, giving data from 2,465 women.
   Researchers estimated that for unmarried women ages 18 to 44, 15
percent have never had sex and 9 percent have had only infrequent
sex, leaving 76 percent considered sexually active, Forrest said.
The same kind of calculation yielded the 71 percent for 1982, she
said.
   Increases in sexual activity may mean young adults believe they
can avoid getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome through
sexual contact, that they can judge a person's health by appearance
and that they are protecting themselves by choosing only apparently
healthy people as partners, researchers said.
   The study also found that condoms were used by 16 percent of
unmarried women ages 18 to 44 and at risk for unintended pregnancy,
an increase from 9 percent. Researchers cited publicity about the
condom's effectiveness in preventing spread of sexually transmitted
diseasese, especially AIDS.
   Susan Kegeles, a research psychologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, said Wednesday she is not surprised by
the reported levels of sexual activity.
   ``I think heterosexuals are just not feeling terribly at risk
for AIDS,'' she said.
   She called the reported increase in condom use ``terrific'' and
said the trend must continue. Men and women should feel they can
tell a partner they insist on condoms as a routine matter, she said.
   Forrest said despite the condom trend, the 1987 level of use
remains low.
   Susan Tew, spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, said the
study focused on women because ``that's all we have data on.''

<HEAD>Vice President Plans to `Open Up' Personal Side in Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said in an
interview published today that he plans to ``open up and share''
his personal side in the presidential campaign to counter his image
as an ``Ivy League elitist.''
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, told the editorial board
of USA Today that his family life has been ``something so private
and so special that I haven't felt like sharing it.''
   ``At this level of American politics, I have to open up a little
and share, so at our convention, you will see five Bush children,
their five spouses and our 10 grandchildren,'' Bush said in the
interview, which took place Wednesday.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis ``speaks
Spanish. I wish I did,'' Bush said, ``But I have three
grandchildren, my blood coursing through their veins, who are half
Mexican. I've never shared this.''
   He said the thoughts about his family's public role were raised
by the recent Democratic National Convention, where Dukakis, former
contender Jesse Jackson and others spoke of family values and
appeared publicly with relatives.
   ``We saw a good show there in terms of family. Very good, from
the heart, genuine,'' Bush said. ``I haven't felt too comfortable
talking about my family.''
   Bush said the public perceives him as an Ivy League elitist, but
he resists that mold. ``For example, I like pork rinds, but that
doesn't fit the mold. I play horse shoes.''
   Asked about Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's refrain at the Democratic
convention of ``Where was George,'' Bush said he was on the job.
``I was up at the United Nations, laying in perspective what ought
to happen: The Iranians doing that which they had been unwilling to
do, recognize the U.N. resolution and talk peace.''
   Bush represented the United States government last week at a
United Nations Security Council meeting on the U.S. downing of an
Iranian commercial airliner carrying 290 people. Iran has since
said it will recognize a U.N. resolution calling for a cease fire
in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Bush dismissed Democratic criticism of his role in the
Iran-Contra affair as ``politics, nothing more.''
   ``Remember the ridicule about `moderates' in Iran? Now others
are talking about the moderates in Iran,'' Bush told the newspaper.
   The vice president also called Jackson a ``loose cannon'' when
asked whether Jackson should have a role as an envoy to free
hostages in the Middle East.
   ``It shouldn't happen. We're talking about very sensitive
foreign policy. The administration is empowered to conduct those
negotiations at the United Nations. We don't need any loose cannons
rolling around the deck,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she won't
see a United States of Europe and hopes it will never come to pass,
and she rejected calls for uniform taxes and a central bank for the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in a radio interview Wednesday, said officials
proposing a federal government for Western Europe ``spend far too
much time talking about these airy-fairy ideas.
   ``They say `Let's have European union.' I say `What do you mean,
because I can't see any of you dissolving your own countries into a
United States of Europe','' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The 62-year-old prime minister said a United States of Europe
would ``never come in my lifetime and I hope never at all.''
   It was her most outspoken criticism yet of what she regards as
impractical overenthusiasm for a European federation. She spoke on
the British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Jimmy Young Show,'' a mixture of
chatty interviews and popular music aimed mainly at housewives.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Economic Community's
Brussels-based executive commission, refused to comment on the
interview.
   Delors, in a speech to the European Parliament on July 6,
predicted that within 10 years 80 percent of social and economic
legislation in the EEC area would be passed on a Europe-wide basis
rather than in the national parliaments of the member states.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, long accused of an insular attitude toward
the rest of Europe, said in the Wednesday radio interview: ``I
think he was wrong. I think he went over the top. I don't think he
should have said it.''
   Last week, the prime minister replaced Britain's EEC
commissioner, Lord Cockfield, who was masterminding an alignment of
sales taxes throughout the trading bloc _ a move Mrs. Thatcher
opposed.
   Alignment of taxes is part of preparations for 1992, when the
EEC is due to become a single market without trade barriers.
   As for an EEC central bank, she said, that would mean
surrendering ``fundamental economic decisions to another country. .
.. That I will not do.''
   Mrs. Thatcher argued she is simply being practical about the
limits of a European union, which she said could never function
like the United States.
   ``The whole history of the two places is entirely different,''
she said. ``It is not possible to have a United States of Europe.
What is possible is for the 12 countries of Europe steadily to work
more closely together on things we do better together, so that we
can trade better together.''
   Opinion polls show British voters are less enthusiastic about
closer ties within the EEC than, for example, the West Germans or
the French.

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee early today ended
a grueling 16{-hour session by approving a far-reaching bill
described as the most significant change in banking law since the
Depression.
   The bill, if adopted by the full Congress and signed into law by
President Reagan, would allow bank holding companies to underwrite
virtually every type of security except corporate stock.
   However, the legislation includes a laundry list of other
provisions banks strongly oppose, including new obligations to
serve poor people.
   And, because of the election-shortened legislative calendar and
the jurisdictional rules of the House, the bill faces an uncertain
future.
   The committee voted for the final measure 30-20, with all but
three Democrats in favor and all but three Republicans opposed.
   From the banking committee, it goes to the Energy and Commerce
Committee, chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who has
expressed skepticism of banks entering the securities business.
   Depending on what kind of deadline House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, sets, Dingell could kill the bill through delay or exact
concessions by threatening delay.
   After Aug. 12, Congress plans to be in session only from Sept. 6
to Oct. 5, leaving little time for a banking bill to pass the full
House and be reconciled with legislation that passed the Senate,
94-2, on March 30.
   Banks long have sought to re-enter the securities business, from
which they have been barred by the Depression-era Glass-Steagall
Act for more than 50 years.
   As originally drafted by the committee chairman, Rep. Fernand J.
St Germain, D-R.I., the bill would not have permitted bank holding
companies to underwrite mutual funds or corporate bonds later
convertible to stock.
   However, those provisions were added by 35-14 and 27-23 votes,
respectively.
   Other securities activities permitted by the bill include the
underwriting of corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal
revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer
debt such as auto loans.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the
committee, failed in an attempt to persuade the committee to move
more slowly.
   ``This bill will have a greater impact than any other piece of
legislation since the reforms passed nearly 60 years ago,'' Wylie
said. ``I believe the changes should be made cautiously and not all
at once.''
   He also sought to kill provisions described as pro-consumer that
banks would be required to accept in exchange for the new powers.
He argued that the requirements would hurt the soundness of the
banking system and ultimately cost consumers.
   Republican opposition to the consumer sections threatened
committee passage of the bill until an hour-long negotiating
session behind closed doors after midnight.
   Democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer
provisions and, in exchange, three Republicans _ Steve Bartlett of
Texas, John Hiler of Indiana and Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania _
voted in favor of the bill.
   It requires banks to serve poor people by providing low-cost
lifeline checking services for accounts between $25 and $1,000.
And, it requires banks to open special accounts for the cashing of
government checks such as Social Security and welfare checks, with
a cashing charge of no more than $2.
   It also requires banks to show a good record of serving poor
communities in their lending area before getting permission from
the Federal Reserve Board to exercise new powers.
   However, in an exemption sought by the Republicans, agricultural
banks with less than $50 million in assets _ about 2,600 of the
nation's 14,000 commercial banks _ would be exempted from the last
requirement.
   Also, the limit on the size of government checks that banks
would be required to cash was lowered from $3,000 to $1,500.
   Other provisions opposed by banking interests include a two-year
moratorium on further bank expansion into the real estate business,
a ban on banks moving into insurance underwriting and severe limits
on the number of banks that can sell insurance underwritten by
other companies.
   Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association, said it was too soon to say if the banking industry
will support the legislation.
   ``The bill improved considerably during the (committee session)
but it still has a number of major problems, including ... some
very burdensome consumer provisions,'' he said.
   Toward the end of the long session, which began at 10 a.m.
Wednesday and ended at 2:30 a.m. Thursday, several committee
members dozed in their chairs. The final compromise on the consumer
provisions left committee members bleary-eyed and a bit giddy.
   When the committee defeated an amendment that would have
required banks to offer special savings accounts for children, one
member shouted, ``It's a good thing the little devils are all in
bed.''
   St Germain, after the final committee vote, exclaimed,
``Hallelujah!''

   The first international chess master to be
beaten by a computer says he wants a rematch before the machines
become invincible against humans.
   ``I'd like to try for revenge while I can. The way they're
improving ... one has the feeling that in a few years they will be
much better,'' Penn State University math professor Edward Formanek
said Wednesday.
   The No. 1 seed in the tournament was defeated here Sunday for
the Pennsylvania State Chess Association championship by Hitech, a
Carnegie Mellon University creation that played its first game in
May 1985.
   Hitech was the first machine to become a senior master, the top
national title before international ranking, according to the
tournament director.
   ``It played some flashy moves in the end game. That's where it
played like a human,'' said Formanek, who has played chess 28 years.
   The computer appeared to dally for 10 or 15 moves then committed
itself to a tactic that seemed questionable but proved to be a
winner, he said.
   ``I can see why it waited,'' Formanek said.
   Carnegie Mellon computer researcher Hans Berliner, faculty
adviser to Hitech's team of student handlers, said the machine
``played beautifully'' against Formanek.
   ``I wasn't real impressed with its play. I thought it could have
played a little more interesting types of games. It grinds them
out,'' said tournament director Thomas Magar, a chess master.
   ``There are times when it makes moves that I have to shake my
head at,'' Magar said. ``Sometimes they're just dull moves. Other
times it plays some positions that human players would say `That's
too risky.'''
   Hitech's new rating of 2,405 points makes it a senior master. It
is the first computer to earn the title and the first to defeat an
international master in tournament play, Magar said.
   The computer, which finished in a tie for first place in the
1987 state championship, is unlikely to gain international status,
because the World Chess Federation ``isn't real happy about
computers playing chess,'' Magar said.
   The U.S. Chess Federation, which sanctioned the state
tournament, recognizes the machines in its standings but also
accommodates tournaments whose organizers ban the electronic
players, he said.
   Berliner claims Hitech is superior to other chess computers
because it can recognize patterns among various clusters of pieces
on the board.
   ``Together with its blinding speed, that accounts for its
success,'' he said.
   Hitech reviews the possibilities for moving its pieces each
turn. The computer can consider about 160,000 possibilities every
second and may consider 20 million different moves before dictating
on a printer the next move, said Berliner, who moved the pieces in
the state tournament.
   The machine is a university project in artificial intelligence,
but Hitech is far from being able to reason and to learn.
   ``That's too hard,'' Berliner said. ``To be able to learn you
have to be able to conceptualize and all that.''

<HEAD>Palace Confirms That Marcos Offered $5 Billion For Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's executive
secretary confirmed today that Ferdinand Marcos offered to pay $5
billion to return home, but said her staff recommended that the
offer be rejected.
   Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig told reporters he believed
the offer was a ploy by the deposed president to avoid criminal
indictment in the United States.
   ``We saw it for what it was,'' Macaraig said. ``It was just a
ploy to get his U.S. indictment against him suspended ... I
recommended the rejection of the five billion dollar offer.''
   Macaraig did not say whether Mrs. Aquino accepted the advice. On
Wednesday, she told reporters Marcos should send the money first
``and then we'll talk.''
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos and his family to return
from Hawaii, where they fled after a February 1986 popular uprising
toppled his 20-year administration.
   Her government alleges that he stole about $10 billion from the
Phillipines' treasury.
   In New York, The Village Voice reported this month that U.S.
attorney Rudolph Giuliani had recommended that Marcos and his wife
Imelda be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection
with acquisition of real estate in New York.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed later that the
White House had asked to be consulted before the Justice Department
sought any indictment against Marcos.
   In a statement Tuesday from Hawaii, Marcos said ``negotiations''
about his return were taking place, but denied he had offered to
pay the money in exchange for permission to return to the
Philippines with immunity from prosecution.
   But Macaraig said the offer by the ousted president was relayed
earlier this month by Emmanuel Pelaez, Philippine ambassador to
Washington.
   Macaraig said Pelaez told him he had been approached by two
Americans about the Marcos offer and relayed it to Manila. Macaraig
identified one of them as James McGregor, a political science
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   Macaraig said he could not remember the other American's name.
   On Wednesday, Boston University professor Allen Weinstein said
the $5 billion offer was in a proposal brought to him by a Marcos
representative and was part of the ``substance'' of a letter to him
from Marcos.
   ``I was approached last month in Washington by a representative
of former President Marcos with a list of proposed `agreement
points' for an arrangement which would allow his return to the
Philippines,'' said Weinstein.
   The points were ``conditioned by an offer on his part to accept
the legitimacy of the Aquino government, stay out of politics,
throw his support behind Aquino and provide her government with $5
billion,'' Weinstein added.
   Weinstein identified the Marcos emissary as Jay Hoffman, a
California advertising man.
   Weinstein declined to comment on Marcos' denial. A source close
to the discussions with Marcos, insisting on anonymity, said the
ousted president's statement appeared worded to provide him
deniability.
   Weinstein is president of the Washington-based Center for
Democracy, a non-partisan U.S. organization promoting democracy
abroad and was a member of the U.S. observer team to the 1986
Philippine elections.
   Hoffman returned on July 13 with two letters signed by Marcos,
one addressed to President Aquino and one addressed to Weinstein,
``which outlined what I view as Mr. Marcos' personal petition to
the Philippine government'' said Weinstein.
   ``I sent President Aquino's letter to Manila, assured that it
would reach her, along with the substance, including the $5 billion
figure, of what was contained in the letter to me,'' Weinstein said.
   A source knowledgeable of the Weinstein-Hoffman contacts said
the $5 billion was explicitly mentioned in Marcos' letter to
Weinstein but not in the one to President Aquino.

<HEAD>Speculators Flee Falling Commodity Markets; Inflation Outlook
Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors who jumped into the agricultural
commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last
spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather
changed for the wetter, analysts say.
   With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for
future delivery of grains and soybeans have dropped off sharply.
   ``This is not a good market for speculators anymore,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, grain market analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the
livestock and sugar futures markets, prompting some economists to
lower their month-old projections for 1989 food inflation from
about 7 percent to 6 percent or less.
   That may be good news for consumers but it's not much
consolation for the speculators who bet on rising crop prices and
failed to collect when the markets peaked late last month and early
this month.
   The ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that
ended Tuesday with soybeans for August delivery at $7.55{ a bushel,
a 31 percent drop from the contract's high of $10.93{, reached June
23. The value of a 5,000-bushel soybean contract plunged nearly
$17,000 during the period.
   August corn settled Tuesday at $2.87{ a bushel, down 21 percent
from its high of $3.64 on July 5.
   The reason for the collapse: rain.
   After 2{ months of unseasonable heat and little water in the
Corn Belt, the Midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the
struggling crops about two weeks ago. Five days of scattered
showers were followed by cool temperatures, more rain and more cool
weather.
   The change ``turned this market on a dime,'' said Rich Feltes,
chief grain market analyst for Refco Inc., a large, Chicago-based
speculative trading firm.
   ``Trees don't grow to the sky, and this certainly is a reminder
of that old trading adage,'' Feltes said. ``Things don't go up
forever.''
   Soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the
agricultural commodities because the nation's relatively small
soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to
changing weather patterns during the growing season.
   Speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in April after
the Agriculture Department predicted U.S. soybean inventories would
total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins
Sept. 1, down from 436 million bushels a year earlier.
   On April 4, August soybean futures settled at $6.80 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Speculators who bought in at that price
and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits.
They could sell today and still come out ahead.
   Analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into
the soybean market at about $9 a bushel in mid-June and were
determined not to sell until prices topped $11.
   Soybeans never went that high and by the second week in July,
those investors were losing money on paper. Many have been forced
to sell at a loss.
   ``People bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and,
lo and behold, those speculators are out now,'' said Steve Bruce,
an analyst with Gelderman Inc., a Chicago trading firm that caters
to commercial processors of grain.

   Rioters fatally stabbed three people in
the western state of Gujarat, where a police strike entered its
fourth day today and prompted officials to call out the army, the
Press Trust of India reported.
   The stabbings occurred Wednesday night in Godhra, 465 miles
southwest of New Delhi, the news agency said. The identities of the
victims and the motive behind their slayings were not immediately
known.
   The strike by state police was called after the government on
Sunday ordered the arrest of union leaders who were demanding
higher wages and better benefits. Officials accused the leaders of
inciting a police rebellion.
   The policemen walked off the job Monday in Ahmedabad, an
industrial city 18 miles south of Gandhinagar, the state capital.
The strike later spread all over the state and units of the federal
reserve police and other paramilitary forces were ordered to take
up routine police duties.
   Policemen in 138 out of the state's 426 police stations joined
in the strike, the sixth by Gujarat police in nine years, the
government said.
   The policemen are asking for a monthly $75 wage hike. A
constable earns about $142 a month.
   At least 83 policemen have so far been dismissed and 23 arrested
on charges of indiscipline.

<TEXT>
   A faulty valve and other technical
problems have forced another 24-hour delay, until Monday, of the
critical launch pad test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's three
main engines.
   ``We got behind in the schedule and never made up the time,''
Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said Wednesday. ``We wanted to be sure we were
clean when we went into the tanking.''
   The tanking refers to the loading of half a million gallons of
propellant into Discovery's external fuel tank during the first of
a two-part countdown leading to the test-firing.
   The fueling was rescheduled for tonight, with the countdown then
set to move down to 10 seconds before a mock liftoff on Friday
morning. At that point, a simulated problem is to force a
``launch'' postponement, and the launch team is to empty the fuel
tank, start a new countdown, refill the tank and aim for the engine
firing at 7:30 a.m. Monday.
   The 20-second ignition will test modifications made to the
engines since the explosion of shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986,
and is considered essential to certifying Discovery for the first
post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   NASA is moving ahead with the test-firing while still attempting
to fix a small gas leak in a vent line associated with a steering
engine that is separate from the main engines.
   Engineers hope to be able to make a repair without taking
Discovery off the pad and into a hangar, a move that could delay
the launch, now officially set for early September, as much as two
months.
   Officials concede that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad,
the launch likely will slip into the second half of September.
   Several on-pad repair approaches have been tested, and the
engineers appear to be favoring one in which a 20-square-inch hole
is cut in the rear wall of Discovery's cargo bay.
   Cutting the hole would enable them to reach the
otherwise-inaccessible leak, which is in an engine compartment.
They could either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a
clamshell device filled with an epoxy sealant.
   Specialists still are testing a method in which a device
resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the
27-foot-long vent line trailing a sealing agent.
   NASA could select one of the methods as a prime candidate as
early as today. But no decision on whether or not to roll Discovery
off the pad will be made until after the main engine firing.

<HEAD>Report: FBI Memo Shows New Teamsters New Leader May Have Had Mob

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Teamsters President William J. McCarthy
said in a 1984 conversation that he needed permission from a
reputed organized crime boss before he could advance in the union,
the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   In addition, McCarthy's name was mentioned at a meeting between
reputed New York mobster Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno and alleged
Cleveland mob figure John ``Peanuts'' Tronolone, in a discussion
secretly monitored by the FBI, the newspaper said.
   The report was the first public indication of any links between
organized crime and McCarthy, who was chosen a few weeks ago by the
union's executive board to succeed Jackie Presser as president.
Presser died this month while under indictment on payroll padding
charges.
   McCarthy had told Presser he wanted to be general
secretary-treasurer of the union, but needed the approval and
backing of Raymond L.S. Patriarca, the late reputed head of the New
England mob, according to an FBI memo obtained by the Times.
   The April 19, 1984, memo was addressed to Oliver B. Revell,
then-assistant director in charge of the FBI's criminal
investigative division. It said that Presser, an informant on mob
matters for 10 years, had told FBI agents that he had the
conversation with McCarthy in early April 1984.
   McCarthy has declined to comment about the matter. A spokesman,
Duke Zeller, said Wednesday that McCarthy may have a statement this
week.
   The FBI memo has remained secret since it was drafted but is
expected to be introduced soon in federal court by government
lawyers to help support a Justice Department lawsuit that seeks the
ouster of top Teamsters leaders on grounds of corruption. The
lawsuit was filed the day Presser died.
   An FBI transcript of the electronically monitored meeting held
in May 1984 quotes Tronolone as telling Salerno that McCarthy might
be worthy of Salerno's support for secretary-treasurer, considered
the second most powerful position in the union, the Times said.
   In this meeting and another FBI-monitored meeting in June 1984,
Salerno listens to brief talk about McCarthy but does not indicate
he has reached any conclusion or will back anybody for the job, the
Times said.
   Presser eventually selected Weldon L. Mathis of Atlanta as
secretary-treasuer. The newspaper, citing unidentified sources,
said Presser personally cleared that appointment with James E.
Moody, an FBI official to whom Presser sometimes reported in his
role as an informant.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnam-installed government
and delegates of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas clashed at peace talks
that ended today, and a settlement of the 9-year-old civil war
remained elusive, participants said.
   One participant, Foreign Minister Suppiah Dhanabalan of
Singapore, said the four Cambodian factions remained ``quite far
apart'' after four days of informal talks.
   The talks brought together Vietnam, the nominal coalition of
three guerrilla groups opposing its occupation of Cambodia, the
Phnom Penh government, and Vietnam's close ally, Laos.
   Also attending were representatives of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, which backs the guerrillas: Thailand,
Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Working groups of senior officials of all the parties are to be
set up to discuss specific issues. By year's end, the groups are to
make recommendations on holding another round of talks.
   The guerrilla leaders were Khieu Samphan of the communist Khmer
Rouge; Son Sann of the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front; and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, representing his
father, former Cambodian monarch Prince Nordom Sihanouk.
   Vietnam maintains more than 100,000 troops in Cambodia to fight
the guerrillas, but has pledged a total pullout by early 1990. That
led to the Bogor talks and an anxious search for a political
solution to prevent a bloodier civil war.
   Vietnam's delegate, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, said he
was ``half happy'' with the talks. ``We are determined to have a
political solution before the end of 1990,'' he said.
   A closing statement by the host, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas, said all participants agreed on the urgent need for a
political settlement leading to a neutral and non-aligned Cambodia.
   It said they also agreed on withdrawing Vietnamese forces,
preventing ``the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices''
of the Khmer Rouge regime, and ending foreign arms supplies to the
warring parties.
   The participants also agreed on the need for definite timetables
and an international presence to supervise these processes, the
statement said.
   But Khieu Samphan said in a statement that it was a ``shameless
lie'' to claim the groups agreed on a wide range of issues.
   His statement also appeared to reject any linkage between the
pullout of Vietnamese troops and steps to prevent the Khmer Rouge
from returning to power, although it said the Khmer Rouge agreed
that no single faction should have power. It said Vietnam must
withdraw from Cambodia unconditionally.
   The Khmer Rouge killed at least a million people in its attempt
to impose radical agrarian communism when they ruled Cambodia from
1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978 to end bloody Khmer Rouge
attacks on its western border. The group is the strongest of the
three guerrilla groups and reportedly is storing arms for an
offensive in 1990.
   Alatas and Dhanabalan called the talks ``a very important
psychological breakthrough'' _ the first time all the parties
talked face-to-face.
   However, Dhanabalan added: ``The points were made with smiles,
with soft words, and very diplomatically. ... (but) if I look at
the substance, I am less sanguine. I think more effort is needed.''
   He said at least two Cambodian factions ``are still quite far
apart ... They basically reiterated old positions.
   ``Unless there is a genuine attempt on the part of the Cambodian
factions, especially two of the factions, to compromise on the
issues and be ready and willing to share in the power structure of
a future Cambodia, it will be difficult to make progess.''
   Dhanabalan did not name the two parties, but Hun Sen, prime
minister of the Phnom Penh government, told a news conference of
his strong disagreements with the Khmer Rouge.
   ``My party, Son Sann, and Prince Ranariddh have made efforts to
find common ground,'' he said. ``It was a pity that the Khmer Rouge
rejected our proposal.
   ``We proposed a national reconciliation council with Sihanouk in
charge, but the Khmer Rouge rejected it,'' he said. ``We accept
political participation of the Khmer Rouge in any political
solution but not the participation of their army.''
   In a peace plan presented Monday, the first day of talks, Hun
Sen called for ``elimination'' of the Khmer Rouge leadership and
``dissolution'' of its armed forces.
   Hun Sen also announced today he would meet Sihanouk in Paris in
October for a third round of separate talks. No significant
progress was made at their meetings in France last December and
January, and Sihanouk later canceled a third round scheduled for
April in Pyongyang, North Korea.
   Sihanouk, who is considered central in any future Cambodian
government, resigned July 10 and refused to attend the Bogor talks.
But he met Wednesday in Jakarta with his guerrilla partners and Hun
Sen and issued another peace plan, which Hun Sen said he would give
``due consideration.''

   Two popular American films are showing in the
Soviet capital this week as part of a project aimed at improving
understanding between the superpowers at top governmental levels.
   ``E.T.'' got a warm reception when it made its Soviet debut
Wednesday night before a select audience of 450, and also at a
packed showing later for the general public at the 2,400-seat
Oktyabr cinema, said Andrei Semenov of the Soviet Filmmakers Union.
   Members of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, were
invited for the first screening of the Steven Spielberg fantasy
about a relationship between a young boy and a displaced alien
creature.
   The second American film, to be screened tonight, is ``Coming
Home,'' in which actor Jon Voight won an Academy Award for his
portrayal of a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran.
   In Washington, members of Congress were invited to watch two
Soviet films that have drawn more than 2 million Soviet viewers
over the past month _ ``The Cold Summer of '53'' and ``Commissar.''
   ``Cold Summer'' depicts the trauma that followed dictator Josef
V. Stalin's death, when political prisoners and criminals alike
were freed in an amnesty. ``Commissar'' was banned in the Soviet
Union for 20 years, presumably for its sympathetic portrayal of a
Jewish family.
   The exchange was arranged by a private group of filmmakers from
both countries who call their joint project the American-Soviet
Film Initiative.
   ``This film exchange is a great opportunity for the leaders of
our two nations to see how films in our respective societies deal
with controversial issues,'' said U.S. director Lawrence J.
Schiller, chairman of the initiative group.

   An Army private infected with the
AIDS virus was acquitted of aggravated assault charges for having
sex with three other soldiers, but was sentenced to two months'
confinement on two lesser counts.
   Pvt. Adrian G. Morris Jr., 28, of Caseyville, Ill., was found
guilty Wednesday by a military judge of one count of conduct
bringing discredit upon the Army for having sex after his superiors
counseled him against it.
   The judge also found him guilty of one count of sodomy with
another male private.
   He had been accused of threatening the lives of three soldiers,
including two women, by having unprotected sex with them although
he had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' said Morris, who in March 1987 became
the first member of the military to be charged with AIDS-related
offenses.
   He said he had anticipated a harsh sentence if convicted
``because of the emotion surrounding'' the case and ``the disease
itself.''
   But the judge, Army Col. Raymond D. Cole, deliberated less than
20 minutes before acquitting Morris on three counts of aggravated
assault and two counts of conduct bringing discredit on the
military.
   ``I am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his
sexual partners,'' Cole said.``By God's good grace, and blind luck,
no one was infected.''
   Cole sentenced Morris to two months' confinement at Fort
Huachuca, where he has been restricted for the last 15 months,
ordered him to forfeit $1,200 in pay over three months, gave him a
bad-conduct discharge and ordered him not to have unprotected sex.
   Col. Harry C. Beans III, whose office prosecuted Morris, said he
was trying to ``figure out the judge's logic with our failure to
prove an aggravated assault. Quite frankly, I thought we did it, I
thought we made our case.''
   But Beans added that he wasn't ``down'' on the verdict. ``We're
talking about a human being, a young soldier here, and it really is
a tragedy.''
   Cole said the government's theory about aggravated assault of a
sexual partner was ``revolutionary, but not well established.''
   The judge found Morris innocent of aggravated assault involving
his former fiancee, Specialist Patricia Pruitt; a soldier
identified pseudonymously as Pfc. Jane Doe; and then-Pfc. Anthony
L. Baldwin, along with conduct charges involving the latter two
soldiers.
   The judge indicated that when Morris had sexual contact with
Jane Doe and Baldwin in late 1986, he was not aware that AIDS could
be transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids.
   But Cole found Morris guilty of the single conduct charge for
resuming unprotected sex with Pruitt in January 1987, even though
he had been given detailed counseling for soldiers who have tested
positive to the human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Before sentencing, Morris, through a statement read by a defense
lawyer, apologized to his parents ``for all the embarrassment I
have brought to the family (and) to all I have hurt.''
   He added, ``I never meant to harm (anyone).''
   Morris said that on learning of being HIV-positive in 1986, ``my
first decision was to be celibate. But I soon realized this was not
realistic.''
   Before the sentencing, two sergeants testified on Morris'
behalf, praising his work and character.
   Legal issues delayed his trial and military courts have tried
other AIDS-related cases in the interim.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Repelling Attack By Iraqis And Rebels</HEAD>

   Iran said its soldiers today crushed a
force of Iraqis and Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels in two days of
fighting it said left 4,000 invaders dead or wounded.
   ``The combatants of Islam were able to inflict heavy blows on
the aggressive enemy and mercenaries of world arrogance,'' said an
Islamic Republic News Agency dispatch monitored in Cyprus.
   It said the fighting around the western city of Eslamabad, 60
miles from the Iraqi border, continued against ``remnants of the
enemy troops'' who were ``surrounded by Iranian combatants.''
   The Iranian rebel group, the National Liberation Army, earlier
said in communiques released in Baghdad that its fighters seized
Eslamabad and the city of Karand, killing or wounding 30,000
Iranian troops.
   The claims could not be verified because foreign reporters are
allowed into battle areas only on rare guided tours.
   In New York, Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, and continued to insist
on direct negotiations with Iran for a cease-fire in the nearly
8-year-old war.
   Aziz said before the meeting with Perez de Cuellar that Iraq
``shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step.''
   Iran agreed last week to a year-old U.N. cease-fire resolution
already supported by Iraq.
   IRNA said Iran's air force jet fighters and helicopters today
``heavily pounded'' the invaders, whom it called ``Iraqi troops and
the outlawed Munafiqeen Khalq members.''
   That was a reference to the Mujahedeen Khalq, Baghdad-based
Iranian rebels opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic
fundamentalist government. In a play on words, the state-run
Iranian media often refer to them as the ``munafiqeen,'' the Farsi
word for ``hypocrite.''
   The agency gave the casualty figure and reported that 1,500
Iraqi troops were killed or wounded in fighting Wednesday near the
southern port city of Khorramshahr.
   Ali Riza Jafer Zada, spokesman for the Mujahedeen Khalq rebels
based in Iraq, said Wednesday in Baghdad that its fighters shot
down two Iranian warplanes and a helicopter gunship in the central
sector of the warfront.
   During previous actions said to involve the Mujahedeen Khalq,
Iran has declared that Iraqi soldiers fought the battles and
allowed the rebels to take the credit. No independent observers
have seen the battles.
   The rebel offensive emerged Monday from an Iraqi invasion that
began on Friday, but the rebels apparently advanced while Iraqi
troops were withdrawing.
   Tehran radio said earlier Wednesday that ``Iraqi troops''
entered Eslamabad in the morning.
   ``The battle in the region is continuing with utmost intensity
and the initiative lies with the combatants of Islam,'' it said.
Iraq, which says it is leaving all Iranian territory it occupies,
did not comment.
   Iraq said its jet fighters on Wednesday flew 205 sorties,
including an attack on a Hawk missile battery east of the Karun
River in southern Iran, and helicopter gunships flew 73 sorties.
   A Baghdad military communique said 15 armed Iranian boats tried
to approach an Iraqi naval ship and three were sunk in the ensuing
battle, but it did not say where the encounter took place.
   Iraqi warships are not known to have operated in the gulf for
years.
   IRNA said Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs near Bakhtaran,
a provincial capital in the central region.
   The Iranians frequently accuse Iraq of using chemical weapons,
which are banned under the 1925 Geneva Convention. Iraq has
acknowledged their use, but claims Iran introduced chemical weapons
to the war.

<HEAD>Government Suspends Plans Requiring Journalists To Register</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today
temporarily suspended regulations that would require some
journalists to register or face penalties that include imprisonment.
   The regulations, which were to take effect Sunday, drew heavy
criticism from media groups here and abroad that accused the white
minority government of making further inroads against press freedom.
   Stoffel Botha, minister of home affairs, said the registration
of journalists ``remains a matter of grave concern for the
government,'' but that the regulations had been temporarily
suspended for ``practical considerations.''
   He said the regulations would be reviewed, but gave no
indication when he would make a final decision.
   The broadly worded strictures say anyone carrying out
``news-agency'' business must register with the government or face
a 10-year prison term or a $8,500 fine.
   Lawyers say the definition of a ``news agency'' is so broad that
major commerical papers that exchange stories, church and political
groups that publish newsletters, and businesses that issue regular
press statements on their operations could be included if the
government so desired.
   South Africa's largest news agency, the South African Press
Association, and all major international agencies, including The
Associated Press, were exempted from the regulations.
   But local journalists who supply news on a part-time basis to
some of the world's major news organizations would be required to
register if they work for more than one employer, which many do.
   Under the regulations, Botha would be able to remove journalists
from the registration list and prevent those people from working in
the profession if he objects to their reporting.
   Botha already has broad censorship powers that allow him to
close down publications and expel foreign journalists.
   The latest regulations appear aimed at the small, local news
agencies around the country. But most news organizations operating
in South Africa receive reports from the local agencies and would
be affected as well.
   Botha has accused the local agencies of endangering public
safety by reporting unfavorably on police activities, forced
removals of poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that are
not covered regularly by any other news organizations.
   The Foreign Correspondents Association of South Africa has said
that even journalists not required to register would be
``compromised'' because they would be seen as having favored status
with the government.
   State-of-emergency regulations already in force restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the
government considers subversive.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Director of Illinois Arts Council Admits False Resume Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executive director of the Illinois Arts
Council has admitted making false claims on the resume he used when
seeking the $55,000-a-year post, and has been placed on an unpaid
leave of absence.
   John P. Riley, 38, claimed on the resume that he had been a
``principal dancer'' with New York's Joffrey Ballet, and that he
was a ``guest artist'' on a public television series, ``Dance in
America,'' in the 1970s.
   In an interview with the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday, Riley
initially maintained that he had appeared with Joffrey in national
tours, but later admitted he had never been a member of the company
in any capacity, only attended workshops run by the troupe, the
newspaper reported today.
   ``I was never featured in ``Dance in America,'' he said. ``The
Joffrey was the one that did `Dance in America.' So I lied.''
   Riley was acting director for several months before being named
last month to replace Adrienne Nescott Hirsch, who resigned to work
for the National Endowment for the Arts. Riley had been the
Illinois agency's deputy director since 1985.
   Riley said it was the first time he had used false information
to get a job.
   ``I'm really embarrassed,'' he said. ``I shouldn't have done
it.''
   The board of the state agency put Riley on unpaid leave
Wednesday, officials said.
   ``Truthfulness is the issue,'' said Shirley R. Madigan, board
chairwoman. She said a board executive committee may discuss how to
deal with the matter by Friday.
   The council runs on an annual budget of $8 million, of which
about $6.5 million is distributed to 2,000 individuals and groups
statewide. The 35 members of the council's supervisory board are
appointed by the governor.
   Riley, a Worcester, Mass., native who graduated from Holy Cross
University in 1972, said in A 1985 resume he worked at a Boston
department store as a full-time sales manager during some of the
time he later claimed to be with Joffrey, the Tribune said.

For Premier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A conservative former general and
wealthy businessman today announced his nomination as prime
minister after Prem Tinsulanonda declined to seek a return to the
post he's held for eight years.
   Chatichai Choonhavan, 66, the likely prime minister-to-be, told
a news conference: ``The five political parties that will form the
coalition government have agreed to support the leader of the
largest party and as that party's leader I am pleased to accept the
nomination.''
   Students and others who for three days staged rallies opposing
Prem's non-elected status welcomed Chatichai's announcement and
said they will stop protesting.
   Chatichai, one of five acting deputy prime ministers, said he
met with army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and ``got military
support.'' He would not elaborate, but the military traditionally
has wielded considerable power in Thai politics.
   If Chatichai succeeds Prem, he is expected to follow a
conservative pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development.
   Prem, 67, made no public statement today. On Wednesday, the
acting prime minister was quoted as saying he was stepping down for
personal reasons.
   He turned down an offer from the leaders of the five key
political parties, which formed a loose pro-Prem coalition after no
single party could capture a majority in Sunday's parliamentary
elections.
   Chatichai's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party and the coalition
partners hold 215 of the 357 seats in the lower house of
Parliament. The other four parties in the coalition are the
Democrat Party, the Social Action Party, the Rassadorn Party and
the United Democracy Party.
   Chatichai said he will submit to Parliament a list of 215
coalition signatures that show support for his succession to Prem.
   Parliament President Ukrit Mongkolnavin said the list would be
handed to constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej later
today for approval. A royal decree announcing the new prime
minister was expected today or Friday.
   Chatichai held several ministerial portfolios in past
governments, including those of foreign minister and minister of
industry.
   Prem, a former army commander, brought stability during his
tenure and until Wednesday did not say whether he would return or
not. He has been criticized for indecision and a willingness to
fashion compromises.
   Student leader Mana Treelayatewat said there will be no further
anti-Prem demonstrations.
   ``Chatichai represents the people who voted him into the
government and we respect that,'' Mana said.
   Mana, the vice secretary-general of the 100,000-member Students
Federation of Thailand, said in a statement that for the first time
in 10 years ``democracy can be developed and mature in Thailand. We
have reached our goal: premiership from direct elections, not
nominations.''

<HEAD>Mayor Rescinds Shoot-to-Stop Order, Says He Didn't Mean It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WADLEY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor who directed police to
``shoot-to-stop'' fighting in a park has rescinded the order,
saying it was a scare tactic to prevent hoodlums from taking over
the city.
   ``I was going to lift the order anyway,'' Mayor B.A. Johnson
said Wednesday. ``I just did it a day early. I think we got our
point across.''
   After a Sunday brawl among youths using sticks as weapons,
Johnson told police officers to ``shoot from the waist down''
anyone caught fighting in the park.
   He said he issued the order to get the attention of ``hoodlums''
from the Wadley area who were making a fighting ring of the 12-acre
Hope Williams Memorial Park in this east-central Georgia city of
2,500 residents.
   Johnson, who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also
ordered them to shoot stray dogs, said as part of the attempt to
stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be
increased from $71.50 to $125.
   ``Certainly they (police) did not plan to shoot anybody,''
Johnson said Wednesday. ``I had not intended to shoot them anyway.
It was issued temporarily. I didn't think it would take very long
for those young people to get the idea we meant business.
   ``It is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they
are not going to take over the city.''

<HEAD>Scattered Thunderstorms Rumble Over Eastern U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from Georgia to New
York state today after spitting out large nuggets of hail and
generating winds up to 63 mph that downed trees and power lines.
   A lightning bolt from a cloudless sky Wednesday afternoon hit
two boys playing softball just northeast of San Antonio, Texas,
melting one boy's tennis shoes and sending both to the hospital,
officials said. Several other boys suffered minor injuries.
   ``It was just one bolt, but it was so strong and so fierce that
it hit those two boys and all the others got the aftershock,'' said
Bexar County Sheriff's patrolman Rick Talamentez.
   The boy whose tennis shoes melted, a 13-year-old, was in
critical condition today at Brooke Army Medical Center. A
15-year-old boy was in good condition there.
   Thunderstorms in southeast Texas Wednesday afternoon produced
hail as big as golf balls and winds which downed trees and power
lines.
   The storms dissipated in the evening, but showers and
thunderstorms continued today in central and eastern Oklahoma.
   Heavy rains in the Boston area Wednesday caused floods up to 4
feet high that closed a highway south of the city, backing up
traffic for hours, authorities said.
   ``We've had massive tie-ups,'' said Metropolitan District
Commission spokesman Larry Gillis.
   In the Deep South, thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon and evening
generated winds that downed trees in Zion, S.C., and toppled trees
and flipped posts in Rex, Ga. Gusts up to 63 mph were recorded in
Florence, S.C.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell across the Southwest.
In central Arizona, thunderstorm winds blew the roof off a trailer
north of Casa Grande. A few showers and thunderstorms lingered over
the Southwest today.
   High temperature records for July 27 were broken in five cities
in Minnesota and the Dakotas. It was 93 degrees in Duluth, Minn.,
where the old mark of 89 was set in 1941, and 106 in Dickinson,
N.D., seven degrees higher than the mark set in 1959. Records were
also snapped in Fargo, Jamestown and Williston, N.D.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 111 degrees in Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
along sections of the East Coast from southern New England to the
Carolinas; scattered showers and thunderstorms from eastern
Oklahoma and northeast Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley, the
central and eastern Gulf Coast and Florida; scattered showers and
thunderstorms in eastern North Dakota and much of western Minnesota
and in the central Rockies.
   High temperatures in the 90s were forecast for much of the
nation; the 80s from the eastern Great Lakes to the upper Ohio
Valley, the Middle Atlantic States and New England, along the
California coast and in western sections of the Pacific Northwest;
the 70s in western Washington state; more than 100 degrees in parts
of the northern Plains and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and
between 105 and 115 degrees from the desert Southwest to the
central and northern valleys of California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Olympia, Wash., to 92 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Vietnamese-Americans Plan Joint MIA Searches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and Vietnam appear
ready to intensify efforts to search together and account for 1,761
Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, the U.S. Embassy said
today.
   An embassy statement said experts from both countries meeting
over the past four days discussed plans to work ``on concerted
efforts within the next three months to make significant progress''
to resolve the divisive issue.
   The two sides, which met in Hanoi, reviewed ``arrangements for
joint investigative, survey and excavation activities'' during the
period.
   The statement described the meetings as ``quite productive, and
we look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in coming months.''
   Members of the U.S. team, which returned from Hanoi today, will
discuss implementation of the joint searches in Washington, the
statement said.
   The Vietnam War ended in April 1975 with a communist victory
over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government.
   In recent months, Vietnam has made significant moves to resolve
the MIA issue. It said this month that it would try to resolve 70
``priority cases'' this year and welcome more joint excavations of
warplane crash sites.
   Facing a ruinous economy and shunned by the non-communist world
for its invasion of Cambodia, Hanoi has been making efforts at
building some bridges to the United States and other western and
Asian nations.
   Hanoi has withdrawn some of its forces from Cambodia and
participated in the Indonesian-sponsored talks to find a political
solution to the Cambodian conflict.
   The U.S. technical team to the Hanoi talks was led by Lt. Col.
Joe Harvey of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and was joined
by representatives of the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory.
Both units are based in Hawaii.
   The talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the United
Nations June 8 between Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam
and retired Gen. John W. Vessey, who last August reached an
agreement with Hanoi for an accelerated search for MIAs, especially
the 70 on Washington's priority list.
   The United States in turn promised to consider Vietnam's
humanitarian problems.
   The priority cases are those the United States considers most
easily resolvable because it says the Vietnamese have information
on them. These include cases where there are photographs of airmen
taken after their capture during the war.
   Since the Vessey agreement, Hanoi has on five occasions turned
over to the United States remains it identified as those of U.S.
servicemen killed in the war. The last turnover, involving 25
remains, was on July 13.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned more than 150 sets of
remains that the army laboratory confirmed as those of Americans.
Vietnam says it has returned the remains of 241 Americans and
information on 45 others whose remains were ``determined to be no
longer in existence.''
   Vietnam has denied charges by some American private citizens
that it is holding live Americans as prisoners.

   A government official said today that
proposed legislation would allow people from mainland China to
visit Taiwan for two months if their relatives here are gravely ill
or die.
   Director Wang Yuan-jen, director of the Exit and Entry Bureau,
said the proposal would be submitted soon to the Cabinet for
consideration.
   Under the plan, mainland Chinese would be allowed to visit their
spouses, parents and children if their relatives in Taiwan can
present documents to prove illness or death in the family, Wang
said.
   The Nationalists have maintained no official contacts with the
Chinese Communists since 1949 after losing a civil war on the
mainland.
   They eased a ban last year to allow Taiwanese to visit China for
family reunions.

   The secretary-general said he was ``very
sober'' on prospects for securing a truce in the Iran-Iraq war
after the first day of peace talks. Javier Perez de Cuellar also
pressed Iran on the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Iran said its soldiers today crushed a force of Iraqis and
Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels in two days of fighting. It said 4,000
enemy soldiers were killed or wounded.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the fighting around the
western city of Eslamabad, 60 miles from the Iraqi border,
continued against ``remnants of the enemy troops'' who were
``surrounded by Iranian combatants.''
   In his first full day of separate truce talks with the
belligerents' foreign ministers, Perez de Cuellar met for two hours
Wednesday with both Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran.
   Aziz said Iraq, which has continued attacks on Iran despite
Tehran's acceptance last week of a year-old U.N. cease-fire
resolution, still wants face-to-face talks with Iran and will not
be ``stampeded'' into a settlement.
   Iraq announced that it would honor Resolution 598 almost
immediately after the Security Council passed it last summer.
   Perez de Cuellar said he raised with Velayati on Wednesday the
issue of the 18 foreign hostages, half of them American, believed
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon.
   ``This is a question on which one has to be very discreet,'' he
told reporters afterwards. ``I raised it very, very specifically.''
   He did not disclose the Iranian envoy's response, and Velayati
did not answer questions about the hostages.
   Earlier Wednesday, the U.N. chief told reporters he thought the
Iranians ``might assert their possible influence in order to have
this problem out of the way'' for ``humanitarian and political''
reasons.
   The Peruvian said he presented to both sides Wednesday the same
ideas for implementing a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war and was
``very sober'' in his assessment of progress. No formal meetings
were scheduled for today.
   Perez de Cuellar said he could not require direct talks if Iran
objects. Iran has refused face-to-face negotiations but has left
the door open to a request by the secretary-general.
   Aziz said that if Iran does not accept direct talks ``that means
that they are not sincere about peace.''
   Some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq's
stubbornness, its continuing military offensive and its alleged use
of outlawed chemical warfare were hampering negotiations.
   They noted that Aziz described his official visit with the
secretary-general as a ``courtesy call,'' while U.N. officials said
it was ``substantive.''
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati charged that Iraq
was procrastinating and sabotaging U.N. peace efforts. He said Iraq
was using chemical warfare, and he lodged a protest with the
Security Council.
   ``How can we take the Iraqis seriously when ... they are using
chemical weapons?'' Mahallati told reporters.
   The Iranians frequently accuse Iraq of using chemical weapons,
which are banned under the 1925 Geneva Convention. Iraq has
acknowledged their use, but contends Iran introduced chemical
weapons to the war.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker and military
commander, offered on Tuesday to help get the nine American
hostages freed if the United States releases Iranian assets frozen
since 1979.
   The White House said ``no deals.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said Wednesday he believed the
secretary-general's ``good offices could help.... Things are
changing.''
   Asked about Rafsanjani's statement and the U.S. response,
Walters said: ``We maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail.
   Walters said he has visited Syria five times to discuss the
matter and ``the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages
in such a way that they won't be replaced by another group of
hostages.''
   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   After a string of military setbacks, Iran announced on July 18
that it would accept Resolution 598, which the 15-member Security
Council passed unanimously on July 20, 1987.
   The resolution calls for a truce, withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
to determine which side started the war.
   Iraq invaded Iraq in September 1980 after several border
skirmishes.

   Authorities closed one of the nation's
six universities indefinitely following violent clashes between
rival student political groups, police said today.
   At least 10 students at Rajshahi University were injured
Wednesday in the clashes and nearly 100 dormitory rooms were
ransacked, police said. The students also set fire to furniture and
books, they said.
   The trouble erupted when more than 100 supporters of the
fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party raided the campus and clashed
with supporters of an eight-party alliance led by the country's
main opposition leader, Sheikh Hasina, a district official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Jamaat supporters were armed with iron rods, sticks and knives.
Three students were hospitalized, he said. One was reported in
critical condition.
   ``We have closed the university for the safety and security of
the students and the campus,'' Amanullah Ahmed, university vice
chancellor, said by telephone.
   Examinations scheduled for next month were postponed.
   The university at Rajshahi, 168 miles northwest of Dhaka, has
more than 11,000 students.
   Bangladesh's universities often are sites of political unrest.
   Opposition parties have been agitating since November to oust
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a former army general who seized
power in a coup in 1982.

   Massachusetts' most impoverished school
system will be managed by Boston University under a plan officials
say could help ``redirect education in America.''
   Under the plan approved Tuesday by the School Committee in
Chelsea, a blue-collar city of 26,000 north of Boston, BU will
serve as an unpaid consultant for about six months. If the plan
works out, the university will manage the schools for a decade.
   ``We see it as the place to begin educational reform,'' said
Bruce Robinson, chairman of the School Committee. ``We hope BU will
bring the cutting edge of educational technology to Chelsea. We
have all the problems of a large urban center but we're small
enough so the effects will be measureable.''
   Chelsea school officials say the city is the poorest in the
state in per capita income. The school system has low reading test
scores and one of the highest teen-age pregnancy rates in the state.
   BU wrote a 300-page report outlining a 10-year plan to reduce
dropout rates and improve teaching in the 3,300-student system.
   ``We could be model for the country,'' said BU Dean of Education
Peter Greer, a director of the program. ``It's perfect for the
national reform movement _ we're stressing a lot of teacher and
parental involvement. If other universities want to do this, they
can come to us and see the results. We're putting our reputation on
the line with this.''
   The university plans to review the curriculum, attempt to raise
teacher salaries and focus heavily on early childhood education,
Greer said.
   He estimated the annual cost of the plan at $2 million and said
BU will seek federal grants and corporate sponsors.
   University faculty and staff will advise the school
administration on ``everything from appointments and curricula to
school buses,'' said School Committee member Andrew P. Quigley, who
conceived the plan.
   ``This is the first step to redirect education in America,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The Red Cross laboratory at St. Louis says it
has closed for reorganization after being cited by the Food and
Drug Administration for more than 150 errors, mostly involving AIDS
and hepatitis screening.
   The faults were detected between January 1987 and June 1988,
Brian McDonough, chief operating officer of the Red Cross St. Louis
Bi-State Chapter, said Wednesday.
   He said 152 blood donations collected during the 18-month period
required further investigation and of that total, 96 donors were
re-evaluated for AIDS or hepatitis.
   ``All 96 re-tested negative to initial screening tests, and
medical history evaluations determined that none were involved in
high-risk activities,'' he said. But he said five showed
``indeterminant'' results.
   These donors, and the six patients who received their blood
products, will be monitored for the next few months to determine
any health hazards, McDonough said. He said the donors and patients
involved had been contacted.
   Other FDA citations involved faults in computer systems,
administrative systems and records.
   McDonough said the mistakes were mostly a result of human error
and said disciplinary measures have been taken.
   ``With the help of the FDA we have made appropriate
corrections,'' he said. ``To protect the health of patients who
rely on Red Cross blood, we are committed to a standard of zero
errors.''
   McDonough said the Red Cross will temporarily transfer its lab
work to a private laboratory in Round Lake, Ill., and a quality
control office will be established under the direction of a Red
Cross vice president.
   The Missouri-Illinois region is one of 56 regional blood service
operations in the country.
   The Red Cross supplies half of the nation's need for blood and
blood products, McDonough said. Each year more than 4 million
volunteers donate over 6 million units of blood to more than 1.5
million patients, he said.

   A woman who as an infant was strapped to her
mother's back while she hijacked an airliner to Cuba confirmed the
identification of her mother as a fugitive 19 years later, FBI
agents say.
   Dakeeta Grinage, 20, of New York City, confirmed for
investigators that an old photograph of a woman known as Haziine
Eytina was really that of her mother, Linda Joyce Grinage, who was
wanted on air piracy charges, FBI agent Steven Grimaldi said
Wednesday.
   Linda Grinage, 39, had been at large since the 1969 hijacking of
an New York-to-Miami flight with 146 people aboard.
   The hijackers, a male and a female, held a 2-year-old boy
hostage and forced the Eastern Airlines pilot at gunpoint to fly to
Havana. A baby strapped to the woman's back was Dakeeta Grinage,
said FBI spokesman Michael Flanagan.
   The FBI said the hijackers were Grinage and her then-husband,
Tyrone Ellington Austin, who died in 1971 from gunshot wounds
suffered in a bank robbery attempt.
   The suspect was arrested Monday. Police said she was living for
at least the last five years in Albany under the name Haziine
Eytina.
   If convicted, she could be imprisoned for 20 years to life.
   ``She was concerned that her mother was injured,'' Grimaldi said
of Dakeeta. ``She made the comment of `why does she have to be
treated as a common criminal?'''
   She also said, ``wouldn't you be upset if your mother had just
been arrested?'' Grimaldi said.
   The woman's lawyer, Edward Wilford, said police relied on a
``sketchy, vague description'' to arrest her and had no
photographic evidence until after taking her into custody. Wilford
said FBI agents were ``basically not asking, but telling''
Grinage's daughter that the woman in the picture was her mother.
   ``They have not sufficiently established to the court that Mrs.
Eytina is Linda Joyce Grinage,'' Wilford said.
   Grinage, who has five children with Mylo Eytina, worked as a
teacher's aide for a preschool program, according to the federal
Head Start program.
   ``For 19 years she's led a law-abiding life,'' Wilford said.
``She's been a stalwart person.''

<HEAD>Jordan Cancels Big West Bank Development Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it was canceling
a $1.3 billion development plan for the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
which was part of Jordan before 1967.
   The move followed reports in regional newspapers that King
Hussein was dissociating himself from the Palestinian question.
   State-run Radio Jordan said the kingdom also decided to
``dissolve all development and tender committees for this plan.''
   The five-year West Bank development plan was set up in 1986 by
joint agreement between the Jordanian government and the PLO. It
was to provide schools, water and agriculture projects and welfare.
   The West Bank was under Jordanian rule until Israel captured it
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, Jordan continued to pay
the salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there, and
West Bank representatives sit in the kingdom's Parliament.
   The uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which began Dec. 8, has given new international
prominence to the Palestinian issue.
   On Wednesday, the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat
quoted Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai as saying ``decisive
developments'' in Jordanian-Palestinian relations were coming up.
   Rifai was quoted as saying the measures planned would be in
response to the wishes of the Palestine Liberation Organization and
the Arabs and sprang from Jordan's desire to give greater
responsibility to the Palestinians.
   On the same day, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas said royal court
Minister Marwan Qassem was the strongest candidate to head a new
Jordanian Cabinet at the start of radical changes in the Jordanian
administration.
   The comprehensive changes in Jordan would be made in light of a
decision by Hussein to dissociate himself from the Palestinian
question and let the PLO shoulder the responsibility, said the
newspaper, which is usually well-informed on Jordan.
   Al-Qabas, in its Amman-dated dispatch, said the changes could
include the appointment of Rifai, the prime minister, as personal
representative for the Jordanian monarch.
   The newspaper, in line with earlier reports in the Arab news
media, reported that Hussein would dissolve the two houses of
Parliament. The 60-member upper house includes 30 members from the
West Bank.

<TEXT>
   The drug and racketeering case against reputed
mobster Gene Gotti ended in a mistrial for the second time after
the jury deadlocked over whether the government had tampered with
tapes of bugged conversations.
   U.S. District Judge John M. McLaughlin declared the mistrial
Wednesday in the case against the 41-year-old brother of reputed
Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. Two other reputed mob figures
also were on trial.
   ``I'm fairly well satisfied that we have reached the Rubicon.
The time has come to declare a mistrial,'' the judge said. The
trial began 10 weeks ago.
   The jury foreman said jurors were troubled by a defense claim
that tape recordings, made from an FBI bug placed in the kitchen of
one of the defendants, Angelo Ruggiero, might have been tampered
with to fit the case.
   The jurors' identities were not released for their own
protection.
   ``The jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence
is, in fact, tampering,'' said Jeffrey Hoffman, Ruggiero's lawyer.
   ``We only hope the court system will recognize this situation
and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not
once again have to undergo criminal proceedings.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert LaRusso denied there was any
tampering.
   The first trial ended in a mistrial in January _ nine months
into the case _ with prosecutors accusing the defendants of jury
tampering. Prosecutors said there would be a third trial;
McLaughlin set Sept. 7 as the tentative date.
   The jury had considered charges of heroin possession,
obstruction, conspiracy, racketeering and running a continuing
criminal enterprise.
   Gotti, of Valley Stream, Ruggiero, 48, of Cedarhurst, and John
Carneglia, 43, of New York City are charged with supervising a
multimillion-dollar heroin-smuggling operation.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said the charge of jury tampering
in the first trial was under investigation.

   A Beverly Hills oral surgeon who injured his
right hand in a fall from a horse during a polo lesson has accepted
a $6.3 million settlement.
   Dr. Andrew Glassman, 37, agreed to the terms Tuesday as his suit
against the operators of Los Angeles Equestrian Center was to be
heard by a jury. Attorney Tom Girardi said Glassman can no longer
practice surgery.
   Glassman was taking a private polo lesson in 1984 when he fell
off his rented horse. In the suit, he claimed that the center was
negligent because a saddle strap snapped and the saddle loosened as
he tried to hit the ball.
   The strap that broke had been repaired earlier with a staple
instead of stitching, the suit charged.
   Glassman's right hand suffered so much nerve damage that he can
no longer grasp anything without pain, Girardi said.
   Patrick Hast, an attorney for Equestrian Centers of America,
operator of the city-owned facility, said an economist and an
accountant were ready to testify that Glassman would have earned $7
million to $8 million during his lifetime if not for the injury.

<HEAD>House OKs Land Swap _ Florida Swampland For Piece Of Downtown
Phoenix</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 3 grafs pinpointing where Florida land is.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, over the protests of two
subcommittee chairmen, has given its blessing to a land deal that
would bring taxpayers 108,000 acres of Florida swampland for a
valuable piece of downtown Phoenix.
   Sent to the Senate on Wednesday was legislation to authorize the
exchange, which was negotiated initially by the Interior Department
and redrawn by Arizona lawmakers to bring their state a slice of
the action.
   The deal could cost the Treasury some $100 million, according to
Reps. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., chairman of the Appropriations interior
subcommitee, and George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the Interior
water and power resources subcommittee.
   Miller and Yates came up on the losing end of the 281-125 vote
that approved the legislation sponsored principally by Interior
Committee chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz., normally allied with
Miller on committee issues.
   The bill would authorize the Interior Department to complete a
complex deal to dispose of the 111-acre site of the Phoenix Indian
School, which the Reagan administration wants to close because of
declining enrollments.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative wing of
Congress, has described the Phoenix land as perhaps the most
valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the West.
   Under the plan, the Collier family interests of Florida would
get 68.4 acres of the Phoenix property in exchange for the Florida
acreage and a cash payment of at least $34.9 million.
   The transaction also calls for the Veterans Administration to
get 11.5 acres of the school property to expand its Phoenix
hospital; Phoenix to get 20 acres for a park; and Arizona to get
4.5 acres for a veterans home. The rest of the land is tied up in
road rights-of-way.
   The money paid by the Colliers would be placed into a trust fund
for the education of Indians in Arizona.
   Yates and Miller argued that taxpayers would get a better deal
if the property were sold on the open market.
   They said at least one appraiser has set the value of the
Phoenix land at $100 million more than the value attached to it in
the proposed exchange.
   ``This is a sweetheart deal between the Colliers and the federal
government,'' Miller said. ``We're being asked to ratify a great
deal for the Colliers and a terrible deal for U.S. taxpayers.''
   Miller argued that while the Florida land is environmentally
sensitive and a good federal acquisition, it already is protected
from any damaging development by federal law.
   ``This is a cushy, cozy deal for the Colliers,'' said Yates.
``If it were not Mo Udall's bill, it would be laughed off the
floor. ... It's a very bad bill.''
   The bill would give the Colliers three years to decide whether
to exercise an option on the Phoenix property. If they did, other
developers would have 90 days to submit bids, which the Colliers
would be allowed to top.
   Miller and Yates argued that this procedure favors the Colliers
because competitors would not be able to come up with the
development plans and financing within a short time.
   They tried to convince the House to send the bill back to the
Interior Committee with instructions to revise it to include an
open competitive bidding process. Their recommittal motion lost
279-133.
   In the Senate, the Indian Affairs and Energy and Natural
Resources committees took testimony on the issue on Monday but have
not drafted legislation of their own.
   The Florida property is in Collier County in Southwest Florida.
The bulk of the 108,000 acres lies immediately north of the Big
Cypress National Preserve, which borders Everglades National Park
on the park's northwest side.
   Another parcel, of 5,000 acres, is adjacent to the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve, known home to perhaps a fifth of the 30 to
50 Florida panthers believed left in the wilderness. The state
preserve is west of the national preserve.
   And 19,620 acres is next to the state's Cape Romano-Ten Thousand
Islands Aquatic Preserve, on the Gulf coast south of Naples and
west of Everglades City.

   The Miami Herald says it won't run cartoons of
Attorney General Edwin Meese III while he decides on a newspaper
merger proposed by its parent company.
   The Herald decided words are better than cartoons in commenting
on Meese while he considers the application from The Herald's
parent, Knight-Ridder Inc., and Gannett Co. to combine business
operations at their Detroit papers.
   Jim Hampton, editor of The Herald, said Wednesday he decided not
to run Meese drawings by Jim Morin because ``a cartoon can't say
`on the other hand.'''
   Hampton noted that The Herald has frequently run editorials
about Meese and that a July 8 editorial informed readers of the
touchy situation. ``The discomfiture in which this matter places
the Herald is self evident,'' he wrote.
   Under a proposed agreement, the advertising operations of the
Detroit papers _ Knight-Ridder's Free Press and Gannett's Detroit
News _ would merge. News-gathering would remain independent.
   The decision fell to Meese when the newspaper groups appealed an
administrative law judge's refusal to grant the merger.
   Under the Newspaper Preservation Act, the attorney general has
the power to grant antitrust exemptions to failing newspapers.
   Free Press Editor Joe Stroud rejected three Meese cartoons by
cartoonist Bill Day. Executive Editor Heath Meriwether, formerly of
The Herald, later assigned a reporter to explain the situation and
published it with the rejected cartoons.

   Amnesty International today urged
Burma's leaders to investigate alleged brutality by authorities who
quelled riots in which scores of people died.
   ``These investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of
those responsible for human rights violations,'' the London-based
human rights organization said in response to a query by The
Associated Press.
   Amnesty International said it was concerned about allegations of
human rights violations of demonstrators and prisoners during
unrest in Burma this year.
   In recent months, several minor quarrels have turned into major
and bloody anti-government riots.
   Western and Burmese sources say riot police in the bloodiest
demonstration, in March, were commanded by Sein Lwin, who this week
was named president of Burma and head of its sole political party.
He replaced Ne Win, who resigned Saturday after 26 years of
authoritarian rule.
   ``They (riot police) and other security or law-enforcement
personnel have been repeatedly accused of excessive use of force
and acts of criminal negligence resulting in unnecessary deaths and
injury to as many as 200 protesters and prisoners,'' the
organization said in a telex.
   The government said that 43 people died in March unrest,
including 41 who suffocated in a packed police van as they were
being driven to prison. Unofficial reports put the death toll at
more than 100.
   Amnesty International said steps taken to investigate abuses
have so far proved ``inadequate.''
   The organization, which investigates human rights abuses around
the world and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said it has
repeatedly expressed concern about evidence ``of a consistent
pattern of political killing, torture and arbitrary detention'' by
Burmese security forces operating in ethnic minority areas.
   The organization said that still limited information available
includes evidence that the army and police in Karen, Mon, Kachin,
Shan and Arakan states committed ``severe violations of human
rights.''
   The Burmese government is waging a decades-old war against
ethnic minority groups.
   A number of Western diplomats and Burmese emigre groups fear
that the ascension of Sein Lwin, who has a long record of ruthless
suppression of dissent, will lead to further unrest and tough
reprisals by authorities.
   ``There are reasons for us to be concerned. Where civil
disobedience has augured, Sein Lwin was on the spot and the result
was killing, maiming and prisoners,'' said Ye Kyaw Thu, general
secretary of the Committee for the Restoration of Democracy in
Burma, in an interview from Washington D.C.
   ``We are very concerned that the students will not be able to
hold back their frustration, agony and anguish,'' he said.
   Sein Lwin commanded troops who put down student unrests in 1962
and 1974 and was involved in purges of government officials in the
mid-1970s.

<HEAD>Worker Dies After Falling Into Bin of Dry Cement</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RECASTS lead to CLARIFY.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A worker who fell off a 60-foot tower into a
huge bin of dry cement gasped for air for nearly two hours while
firefighters tried to pull him out, authorities said. He died
shortly after his rescue.
   ``This stuff is like talcum powder and quicksand _ the faster
you move in it, the more you sink,'' said Bruce Savage, a division
chief with the Fire Department.
   Michael LaGrand, 34, fell into the 20-foot steel hopper
Wednesday. Workers at the concrete-mixing site secured him man by
looping a rope under his armpits. Rescuers wrapped more ropes
around him and gave him an air mask.
   ``He was buried all the way up to his face,'' said Fire Capt.
Roy Billington. ``All you could see was the top of his head, his
face and his hands.''
   About a dozen firefighters tried to pull out the 250-pound
worker. He sank below the surface several times, then slipped out
of sight for the last time. He was pulled from the funnel-shaped
hopper about 15 minutes later, authorities said.
   He died an hour later at Tampa General Hospital.

<HEAD>White House Opposes Abortion Funding for Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last two grafs with those voting against, and not

<TEXT>
   Abortion-rights advocates hailed the Senate's
lopsided vote to extend Medicaid funding to abortions for rape and
incest victims as a breakthrough, but the plan still faces
skepticism in the House and hostility from the White House.
   The Senate's 73-19 vote Wednesday marked the first departure by
either chamber from the restrictive abortion policies of the past
seven years.
   Current law, in effect since 1981, limits payments to abortions
in which the life of the mother is endangered.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., sponsor of the expansion, said the
vote Wednesday represented ``a clear change'' from recent tradition.
   ``What is terribly important is just to break that chain'' of
restrictive regulations, he said. ``It's a first small start.''
   The abortion provision was part of a $140 billion appropriations
bill passed 80-16 Wednesday evening after a day of frenzied votes
and shifting tactics on abortion, family planning and AIDS issues.
   The bill will keep the departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education in business during fiscal 1989 beginning
Oct. 1. Its highlights include $7.1 billion for employment and
training; $1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment, prevention and
education, and $4.2 billion for tutoring and other services to
disadvantaged students.
   In a June 28 statement, the Office of Management and Budget
urged the Senate to strike its Medicaid abortion provision, saying
it ``diverges from longstanding policy on this issue. ... The
president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill,
solely based on the inclusion of this language provision.''
   The abortion provision adopted by the Senate is more restrictive
than the simple extension Weicker sponsored during the committee
process. Federal money would only be available in promptly reported
rape or incest cases, and states could retain the existing, more
limited eligibility if they so desire.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., sponsor of the modified version, said
it reflects ``the middle ground'' on a difficult issue. Weicker
said it had a better shot at surviving negotiations with House
members, who did not include a Medicaid expansion in their version
of the appropriations bill.
   Asked about the possibility of a veto, Weicker replied,
``Considering everything else that's in the bill and that it's an
election year, it could be overridden.''
   But Doug Johnson, legislative director of the National Right To
Life Committee, said he was confident the final product would not
contain the Medicaid abortion expansion.
   ``The House is strongly committed to the current law. So is the
president,'' said Johnson. In any case, he said, his group
considers the Exon amendment ``a very good outcome'' because it
gives states some leeway and eliminates the possibility of rape
claims six months into a pregnancy.
   There was little controversy over money allocations in the bill,
which was drawn up in accordance with the budget framework agreed
to last year by Congress and the Reagan administration. But there
were enough AIDS, abortion and family planning amendments to
prolong debate for three days.
   In a confusing series of events, senators three times rejected
attempts by Sen. Jesse Helms to renew an expiring ban on federal
funds for AIDS education materials that promote or encourage
homosexuality.
   Instead they adopted an amendment described by its sponsor, Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., as a pre-emptive strike against the Helms
ban. While it bans federal funds for materials that directly
promote or encourage homosexuality, at the same time it says the
materials must provide accurate information on how to avoid getting
and transmitting AIDS.
   Some senators disavowed their votes last year in favor of the
Helms restrictions, saying they wrongly believed the restrictions
were toothless.
   ``It is a fact that effective materials have been shelved and
vital proposals have been tabled because of the fear of what this
amendment might do,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman
of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   Nevertheless, after embracing the Cranston amendment 61-37, the
Senate later passed another amendment _ this one containing the
Helms restrictions as well as a phrase saying federally funded AIDS
materials cannot ``use words stating that homosexuality is
`normal,' `natural' or `healthy.'''
   The Senate voted 48-45 to kill a Helms amendment banning federal
money to school-based clinics that distribute contraceptives or
provide abortion counseling or referral services.
   Later lawmakers by voice vote approved a more limited version of
the same amendment, one which dropped the contraceptives section
but retained the ban relating to abortion services.
   School-based clinics are set up by local school boards to
provide health services that sometimes include family planning.
Some receive Medicaid funds and money from block grants funneled
through states.
   Voting against the abortion proposal were Sens. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., John Breaux, D-La., Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., Wendell Ford, D-Ky., John Glenn, D-Ohio, Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Bennett Johnston, D-La., Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., Carl Levin, D-Mich., John McCain, R-Ariz.,
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Bob Packwood, R-Ore., Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., Richard Shelby, D-Ala., Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., and Tim Wirth, D-Colo.
   Not voting were Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash., Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, Joe Biden, D-Del., Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Wyche Fowler,
D-Ga., Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Steven Symms, R-Idaho and John Warner,
R-Va.

<HEAD>Curfew Imposed After Riot Leaves One Dead</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Amnesty International
urging investigation. Pick up 3rd graf pvs: `The government...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A town north of Rangoon was under curfew
today after mobs destroyed Moslem-owned tea shops and attacked
police with stones and catapults, leaving one person dead and five
wounded, sources said.
   It was not certain whether the violence was related to this
week's national leadership changes in which hard-line former army
general Sein Lwin assumed the positions of president and head of
the only political party.
   Also today, Amnesty International urged Burma's leaders to
investigate alleged brutality by authorities who quelled riots in
which scores of people died.
   The government said 43 people died in March unrest, including 41
who suffocated in a packed police van as they were being driven to
prison. Unofficial reports put the death toll at more than 100.
   ``These investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of
those responsible for human rights violations,'' the London-based
human rights organization said in response to a query by The
Associated Press.
   The government news agency said Wednesday that the curfew was
imposed and all demonstrations banned Tuesday in Myede, 220 miles
north of Rangoon, after rioters attacked police with catapults and
stones.
   The official News Agency Burma said police had to shoot to
disperse the crowd and order was restored after several hundred
rioters destroyed two tea shops and a third building.
   The mob first set upon the Moslem-owned tea shops and then went
on a looting spree, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The sources believed the incident was a spillover of
riots in nearby Prome.
   Prome has been under martial law since July 22, after six days
of mob violence that reportedly started with an argument between a
Buddhist customer and a Moslem tea shop owner. Most Burmese are
Buddhist.
   In recent months, several minor quarrels have turned into major
and bloody anti-government riots, including one last March in
Rangoon in which more than 100 people were reported killed. That
riot also began with a tea shop quarrel.
   Some analysts believe that the outbursts reflect popular
resentment of the government and dissatisfaction with deteriorating
economic conditions. Tea shops are popular informal gathering
places for the Burmese.
   Sein Lwin, who ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the last 26
years, on Tuesday became chairman of the Burma Socialist Program
Party and on Wednesday became the nation's president.
   Western diplomats said his rise could fan the fires of political
protest that have erupted three times since last October, leaving
dozens dead, universities closed and student resentment at a
boiling point.
   Leaflets have appeared in Rangoon in recent days urging
continued anti-government agitation.
   In addition to naming Sein Lwin president, Wednesday's one-day,
emergency session of also elected former deputy prime minister Tun
Tin to the post of prime minister. Vice President Aye Ko remained
in his post.
   Defense Minister Kyaw Htin moved to the No. 3 government
position as head of the Council of State. In all, eight of the 22
major government positions were changed.
   The changes appeared to herald a continuation of the hardline,
one-party system begun by strongman Ne Win 26 years ago, although a
number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed.
   Ne Win, 77, said he was retiring, but doubt remains among
Western and Burmese analysts over whether he will fade away or
remain a behind-the-scenes director of events.
   Kya Htin and Tun Tin, however, both are regarded as relatively
liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in
the country. Kyaw Htin also moved up to a top party post.

   Alaska officials have begun regulating
harvests of an icy crop: icebergs that are finding their way into
Japanese beverages as gourmet ice cubes at about $3 a pound.
   The Department of Natural Resources plans to issue permits
Friday for Tim Dimond of Juneau to collect ice in southeastern
Alaska. Dimond contacted state officials to ask whether he needed
permits.
   Later he said he wanted the permits as a way to reinforce, for
overseas buyers, the legitimacy of his ice-gathering business, said
Andy Pekovich, the department's acting land and water manager for
southeastern Alaska.
   ``He initiated this,'' Pekovich said, adding that a permit ``is
to everyone's advantage,'' and anyone else in the ice-collecting
business will be expected to get one.
   The permits are intended to protect wildlife and marine
recreation, Pekovich said.
   Calls to Dimond were not returned.
   Dimond gathers icebergs with a crane on a 200-foot barge and
breaks the ice into chunks for shipment in freezer vans bound for
Seattle. AK-Pacific Inc. further breaks down the ice, packs it in
one-kilogram sacks and ships it to Japan, where a bag sells for
about $6.80.
   In Japan, glacial ice is enjoyed for its novelty and durability.
It lasts about twice as long as an ice cube from a refrigerator,
and has no trace of chlorine or other additives, said Jim Harper,
vice president of AK-Pacific.
   ``It's a gourmet type of product that complements the Perrier,
mineral water situation,'' he said.
   The permits limit Dimond's proximity to campsites used primarily
by kayakers and specify ice-collection hours to prevent harvesting
when sightseeing ships are in the area.
   To protect hauling grounds for seals, he cannot collect ice
within 10 miles of a glacier. The permits will allow Dimond to
collect 1,000 tons a week.
   Southeast Alaska Conservation Council officials oppose the
harvests.
   ``This is a new, incompatible, conflicting use of areas set
aside for their natural features, their solitude, their pristine
nature,'' Bart Koehler, executive director, said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Former Hostages Calls For Release Of Iranian Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. hostage urged the United States
today to consider releasing Iranian assets in exchange for the
release of the nine Americans held captive in Lebanon.
   ``It can be done aboveboard. It can be done legally and openly,
and the Americans, I think, would approve of that,'' said the Rev.
Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest who was held in Lebanon
from January 1985 to June 1986.
   Jenco, interviewed from Portland, Ore., on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America,'' said, ``I absolutely believe we should listen to
the Iranians ... We're talking about the assets of Iran and I'm
talking about the national assets of America which are nine
Americans who are there.''
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said on Tuesday
that Iran would use its influence to try to free American hostages
in Lebanon if Washington releases assets frozen in the United
States.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
will make no deals with Iran over release of the hostages. State
Department officials said they believe the assets referred to by
Rafsanjani are military equipment owned by Iran which President
Carter refused to release after the Islamic revolution toppled the
late Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1979 and 52 Americans were taken hostage
for 444 days.

   An insect that attacks the buds of maple
trees has defoliated or stunted one-sixth of Vermont's forests,
threatening its $15 million-a-year maple syrup industry and its
eye-popping foliage, officials say.
   ``This is serious. This is something we don't know very much
about and this is something we have to learn as much as we can
about as fast as possible to prevent a reoccurence,'' Gov.
Madeleine Kunin said Wednesday.
   Kunin said she would seek about $200,000 in state and federal
funding for a research and management program to combat the
insects, called pear thrips. She said the insect has attacked
466,000 acres in every county in Vermont.
   Western Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York have also
reported thrips damage, but Conrad Motyka, Vermont director of
forests, said Vermont has been hit the hardest.
   The infestation is so severe in some of Vermont's southern
counties that experts may recommend that sugarmakers leave some
maple trees untapped next year.
   ``Maple in Vermont is the most prominent tree that we have,''
Motyka said. ``It could tremendously affect not just our industry
but our very way of life. If you took all the maples away, it would
look very different in Vermont.''
   State officials said they have no estimate of the damage to the
timber industry or to tourism. Vermont's brilliant fall foliage
draws thousands of tourists.
   In the past, thrips were only known to attack fruit trees, but
in the last decade they have started defoliating trees of the
forest.
   ``I think there is national and international concern that this
may be part of the death of some of our forests and that we've got
to put all our resources that we have to work,'' Kunin said.
   Kunin said she would ask the state's Emergency Board to allocate
$93,950 to research the thrips damage. The board includes Kunin and
leaders of the Legislature and handles some financial matters while
lawmakers are out of session.
   Kunin said she would also ask for a $60,000 federal grant as
well as $46,500 from other sources.

<TEXT>
   Western diplomats said today that
Soviet troops have taken over the defense of the airport in
Afghanistan's capital and are deploying heavy military equipment
around it.
   The diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity,
said several Soviet armored vehicles were deployed around the
airport in Kabul. They said these included mechanized infantry
combat vehicles _ a smaller version of Western armored personnel
carriers but with greater firepower.
   Afghan guerrilla attacks from the northeast have been
particularly heavy, diplomats said. Soviet response has been to
deploy armored vehicles to a security post on the eastern edge of
the airport, as well as on a small hill overlooking the airport and
at the main gates of the international arrival and departure
buildings, they said.
   The diplomats said the airport has been the target of frequent
rocket attacks by guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed
government.
   An attack Sunday missed the mark and rockets landed in a
residential area, killing 17 people.
   In late June, a rocket attack destroyed eight Soviet jet
fighters at the airport.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the
government in its war with the guerrillas, who are based in
Pakistan and supported by the United States and Pakistan. Under
terms of an accord signed in April, the Red Army troops began
withdrawing in May and are to be out by February 1989.

<TEXT>
   A $50,000 gold and wood flute stolen from an art
gallery has been returned by a ``fence'' who realized it was ``too
hot'' to handle.
   Emmett Day, the artist who made the one-of-a-kind instrument
with 21-karat gold keys, springs and mouthpiece, said Wednesday the
recovery was ``amazing.''
   ``Everything that happened to it has canceled out the evil of
that original impulse (the theft),'' Day said.
   The flute has been played by such musicians as James Galway, Day
said. The flute and other works by Day were stolen July 8 from the
Northwest Gallery of Fine Woodworking. No one has been arrested,
police said.
   On Tuesday, ``we got a call from an attorney in Tacoma who said
`if your name is Emmett Day, this is your lucky day,''' Day said.
   His wife, Therese, said the thief had sold the art works for
$3,500 to a dealer in stolen goods ``who read about the theft in
the paper and realized he shouldn't destroy them, and he couldn't
resell them because they were too hot.''
   The ``fence'' then contacted the lawyer, she said. Except for
some small scratches, the flute and other articles ``were not
really hurt,'' Ms. Day said.
   Day said he's unsure whether he will put the flute on display
again.

   A bolt of lightning from a cloudless

one boy and melting his sneakers, witnesses and authorities said.
   ``It was just one bolt, but it was so strong and so fierce that
it hit those two boys and all the others got the aftershock,'' said
Bexar County Sheriff's patrolman Rick Talamentez.
   ``The kids were just walking around in a daze, except for the
two of them that were unconscious.''
   Hugo Arauz, 13, was in critical condition at Brooke Army Medical
Center today. Kevin Epps, 15, was in good condition, a hospital
spokesman said. The other youngsters suffered minor injuries,
authorities said.
   Arauz, whose sneakers were melted, apparently was hit directly
by the bolt Wednesday, said Sheriff's Patrolman Jesse Ambriz.
   ``The bad thing about it was they said it was sunny. No rain, no
clouds, no nothing,'' said Thomas Brooks Sr. Two of his sons were
with the group but were not injured.
   The National Weather Service said there was a strong
thunderstorm about four miles away at the time. ``Lightning can
travel for long distances even though the cloud may seem far away
from you,'' said meteorologist Cristy Mitchell.

<TEXT>
   Fire today gutted the home of Winnie
Mandela and jailed black guerrilla leader Nelson Mandela, and
police said it was set by a group of black teen-agers.
   No one was home when the blaze broke out at about noon, and
there were no injuries, police and witnesses said.
   Mrs. Mandela arrived by car about an hour later but remained in
her vehicle and drove to her nearby office without making any
statements.
   The four-room home in the black township of Soweto outside
Johannesburg was charred, and all the contents were destroyed in
the fire, officials said.
   Mrs. Mandela, a social worker and anti-apartheid activist,
shared the modest home with her daughter Zindzi, 27, and two
grandchildren. The house belonged to Nelson Mandela before the
couple was married 30 years ago.
   Police Capt. Ruben Bloomberg said in Pretoria that a group of
black high school students stoned the Mandela home, then doused it
with gasoline and set it alight.
   He said he did not know how many youths were involved nor the
motive for the attack. No arrests have been made, he said.
   Teen-age boys known as ``comrades,'' who regularly guard the
house, pushed journalists away from Mrs. Mandela's office after the
fire, and one threatened to burn a photographer's car.
   The teen-agers blamed the fire on students from a high school in
Soweto. They refused to say anything more about the incident.
   Neighbors and black journalists said Mrs. Mandela's young
supporters were involved in a dispute with a rival group in the
Dube section of Soweto on Wednesday and that the attack was a
response to the quarrel.
   Attorney Amrichand Soma told reporters gathered in front of a
gate blocked by the youths that Mandela was contacted by telephone
at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town and had no public comment on the
fire. Mandela is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting the
overthrow of the government.
   Aubrey Mokoena, a friend of the family and head of the Release
Mandela Campaign, said, ``The community must band together and put
an end to this. Anyone who would think of attacking Mandela's house
represents the forces of darkness. It is time for the community to
stand up and stamp this out.''
   When he arrived at the gate to the office building, Mokoena
greeted the ``comrades'' by saying, ``The war is really on now.''
   Mandela, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress, the
country's main guerrilla group, has been imprisoned for 26 years.
   There are many black political factions in South Africa, and
some oppose Mandela and the ANC.
   On Saturday, Mrs. Mandela visited her husband for 80 minutes.
Mandela turned 70 on Monday.

   An Irish Republican Army man
was buried today in a ceremony tinged with remorse over a series of
IRA blunders that have killed 17 people since November.
   The latest victims _ a Protestant couple and their 6-year-old
son blown up in their car _ were buried later in their hometown of
Hillsborough, outside Belfast.
   The first of the day's two funerals was that of 33-year-old
Brendan Davison, shot to death on his doorstep Monday by the Ulster
Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant group.
   Davison, whom the IRA claimed as one of its own, was widely
believed to have been killed in reprisal for the death of
contractor Robin Hanna, his wife Maureen, and their son David.
   The IRA admitted triggering the bomb that killed the Hannas as
they drove across the border from Ireland to Northern Ireland on
Saturday after a vacation. It says its intended victim was a
Belfast Catholic judge, Ian Higgins.
   Police guarded the approaches to Belfast's Catholic Milltown
cemetery but kept their distance from the funeral. The ceremony
passed peacefully, with none of the IRA ceremonials that have
sparked clashes with security forces in the past.
   Danny Morrison, second-in-command of the outlawed IRA's legal
political wing, Sinn Fein, delivered the eulogy.
   ``For the past number of months we have come through very, very
bleak conditions. It has been a very, very bad time, when it seems
as if everything the IRA has touched has turned to tragedy and it
has been very, very rough for many people,'' Morrison told several
hundred mourners standing in the rain.
   Sending condolences to the Hannas' two surviving teen-age
children, he said: ``We share in their tragedy. What happened was
terrible. It was regrettable. We want to see all deaths end,
including the deaths of our enemies in uniform. We want to see
peace in this country.''
   At the Hannas' funeral, Bishop Gordon McMullan of the Church of
Ireland pleaded with the killers on both sides of the conflict to
``recognize what this cult of violence is doing to your own moral
and spiritual condition.''
   Responding to the IRA's condolences, he said: ``The spokesmen
who represent the killers have made their excuses and expressed
their regret. But the fact is that Robin, Maureen and David Hanna
are dead ... the plotters planned death and death was what ensued.''
   Davison's coffin was draped in the Irish tricolor, and the IRA
said in a statement Tuesday night that it had paid its ``final
tribute'' by firing a volley of shots over a nationalist mural in
Catholic west Belfast.
   It was the first IRA funeral since March 19, when Catholics
following the cortege of a slain guerrilla attacked two British
soldiers who reportedly blundered into the procession.
   The soldiers were dragged from their car, severely beaten and
shot by IRA gunmen.
   Security forces had stayed away from that funeral at the request
of church and political leaders.
   The IRA says it is conducting an inquiry into why five recent
operations have been botched, starting with a bomb in November that
was meant to hit soldiers but killed 11 Protestant civilians at a
war memorial service in Enniskillen.
   Other blunders have since included a bomb on a schoolbus that
injured a dozen teen-agers, a bomb at a Belfast swimming pool that
killed two Catholics, and the shooting of a Protestant woman. In
all cases the IRA has apologized, saying the intended targets were
security forces or judicial personnel.
   The IRA said the Hannas were victims of a ``wronged
description'' of the judge's car. Judge Higgins, his wife Bridget
and daughter Cait were returning from Dublin on the same road.

   Pakistan's foreign minister today allayed
concerns that the Soviet Union was reneging on its pledge to
withdraw the Red Army from Afghanistan.
   ``This impression has just been dispelled,'' Sahabzada Yaqub
Khan said after a meeting with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
``Our position and that of the United States in regard to the
withdrawal is no longer divergent.''
   The pace of the pullout and U.S. hopes for fair elections in
Pakistan were topics for discussion during the foreign minister's
visit.
   There are an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
Half are supposed to be withdrawn by Aug. 15. Pakistani President
Mohamnad Zia al-Haq raised concerns last week that the Soviets were
replenishing them with new troops.
   But Yaqub Khan said ``the Soviets are carrying out the
withdrawal.''
   Through Pakistan, the United States armed Afghan rebels fighting
the Red Army and the pro-Soviet government in Kabul.
   U.S. officials said this week that Moscow had sent new
assurances that the Soviets would fulfill their commitment in the
Geneva accords of last May to withdraw half the troops by Aug. 15.
   The report that they would be replaced was traced to the Soviet
military commander in Kabul, who apparently did not have the
backing of his superiors in Moscow.
   Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Yaqub Khan are
comparing notes on how to monitor the Soviet withdrawal _ and on
Afghanistan's future after the troops are gone. One question is
whether the rebels then would be able to bring down President
Najibullah. Another is the kind of government that would follow.
   Several of the rebel leaders would like to install a
fundamentalist Moslem regime akin to the government in neighboring
Iran.
   ``It is extremely important we look beyond Afghanistan and
continue close cooperation with the United States in the interest
of peace and security in the region,'' Yaqub Khan said.
   The United States has close ties to Pakistan, which gave refuge
to millions of Afghan refugees besides funneling covert U.S.
support to the rebels.
   U.S. officials are hoping the elections Zia has set for Nov. 16
will be fair, but there is a question how much pressure Shultz
might try to apply.
   ``We will stress that elections should be free and fair, but it
is not up to the U.S. government to prescribe how they should be
held,'' said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Zia dismissed his civilian government in May, but did not call
for elections within the 90 days prescribed by the Pakistani
constitution.
   He also barred candidates from running with party labels. Zia
took the position that party-based elections could mislead the
voters.
   Critics say this will focus attention on local issues and work
against Zia's main national opposition, the Pakistan People's
Party. It is headed by Benazir Bhutto, whose father was ousted in
1977 in a coup led by Zia and executed.
   On another touchy issue, President Reagan must certify in
October that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device
in order for U.S. aid to continue. Reagan will see Yaqub Khan
briefly on Friday.
   The Reagan administration last year fought off a drive in
Congress to shelve U.S. military aid to Pakistan amid indications
the country was trying to develop a nuclear bomb.
   Pakistan has denied making such an attempt. It is receiving $260
million in military aid this year and $380 million in U.S. economic
assistance.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, just back
from touring fire-scorched Yellowstone National Park, said today
firefighters are now fighting all new outbreaks. But one official
said it's still possible that some new fires might be left to burn.
   ``Yellowstone is not in danger. ... We're not going to let
Yellowstone be damaged by this,'' Hodel said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America'' program.
   Fighting all new outbreaks has always been a possibility in the
usual ``let it burn'' policy of the National Park Service, Chief
Ranger Walt Dabney said afterward.
   Both Dabney and the secretary defended the post-1972 policy of
fighting only fires that threaten developed areas or that could
spread out of the park into timbering operations on adjacent Forest
Service lands.
   The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management follow
similar policies in their wildnerness areas because fires are
important in generating healthy ecosystems.
   ``The fact is that Yellowstone has about 3 percent currently
burning. ... But they've had a sufficient area under their
fire-management plan that their policy now is to fight new fires
that break out,'' Hodel said.
   Dabney said in an interview the secretary was right in his
facts, and all recent outbreaks had been attacked with a view of
keeping the fires small, but the policy was unchanged _ decisions
will be made case by case, and the action taken will depend on
where the fire is and what is threatened, how many firefighters are
available and how dangerous it would be to commit them.
   A few firefighters can knock down a small blaze that might be
impossible to control if left alone, he noted.
   Any fire that breaks out in remote areas might well be left
alone now, he said. Any fire near the park boundaries probably
would be attacked.
   Crews have begun using flame throwers to start backfires against
fires that have so far scorched some 109,000 of the park's 2.2
million acres. The fires had moved to within six miles of Old
Faithful and forced the closing of one of the park's main entrances.
   ``In Yellowstone specifically we're fighting probably six or
eight large fire areas right now,'' Dabney said.
   Hodel flew over some of the damaged forest land Wednesday and
voiced confidence afterwards in the policy of allowing remote areas
to burn. In his comments today, the interior secretary said the
flames had gone far enough.
   ``What they tell me is we've got standing timber that is as dry
or drier than kiln-dried lumber. That makes it just take off like
crazy when you have a fire,'' he said. ``In these conditions
there's very little control we can have over these fires.''
   Dabney said the damage could even help naturalists learn more
about the forest by providing a close look at how large-scale fires
clear old brush for new wildlife habitat.
   ``What we're looking at probably occurred naturally in the
Yellowstone area every 200 to 400 years,'' he said. ``We've never
really had the chance to see wildfire on this scale in the
Yellowstone ecosystem, so we're going to look at it very closely
from a research standpoint and know a lot more specifically about
the benefits of what's going on there now.''
   About 80 percent of Yellowstone is lodgepole pine in a
``fire-dependent ecology,'' he said. Natural fires ``Are very
important to keep species diversified. Many wildlife species will
leave an area that's too thick and stagnant.''
   New trees and a wealth of wildlife-attracting vegetation grow in
the open areas created by fires, whose ashes act as a natural
fertilizer, he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Discloses Production Sites of Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. delegate to the Conference on Disarmament
today declared the location of the United States' chemical weapons
production facilities.
   Delegate Max Friedersdorf said he hoped the declaration would
``contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of
related provisions'' of a convention banning the production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
   The Geneva conference has been negotiating such a convention for
20 years. This year's summer session began July 7.
   ``The declaration we are making today is unprecedented,''
Friedersdorf told the 40-nation conference.
   ``We urge other countries that possess chemical weapons
production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities
and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed,'' he said.
   He said no other conference member had provided information on
chemical weapons production facilities. The United States and
Soviet Union are the only two members of the conference who have
acknowledged possessing chemical weapons.
   The United States has said it believes about 15 nations possess
such weapons, but it has refused to name them.
   The production facilities declared by the United States are
Rocky Mountain Arsenal, in Colorado; the Pine Bluff Arsenal in
Arkansas; Muscle Shoals in Alabama; Newport Army Ammunition Depot
in Indiana; and Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
   The Soviet Union has declared the amount of its stockpiles, but
not their location nor the location of production sites.
   The Soviet Union said in December that its chemical weapons
stocks total 50,000 tons, but Western experts have estimated that
the actual total is much higher.
   The United States also submitted to the conference ideas for
ways to destroy chemical weapons under an eventual ban.
   Delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban. The
main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating.

   Crews using flame throwers fought fire with fire as a blaze
burned within six miles of Old Faithful, and authorities said arson
caused a South Dakota wildfire that destroyed 22 buildings and
forced 1,000 people to flee.
   Wildfires also chased hundreds of people from their homes in
Idaho, while in Alaska 1,200 firefighters battled wind-fanned
blazes that consumed 1.3 million acres, an area larger than
Delaware.
   Large fires, many of them kindled in drought conditions
aggravated during a hot, dry summer, also blackened regions in
Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington state and Montana.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel took a helicopter tour Wednesday
through thick smoke to view 10,000 charred acres in the southern
areas of Yellowstone National Park, which is suffering its worst
forest fire of the century. The blaze has scorched 109,000 of the
park's 2.2 million acres.
   Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters lit
backfires in about 1,000 acres of meadow to burn fuel ahead of the
fire and direct it away from Old Faithful, the park's most famous
attraction, and nearby structures.
   Even so, the usual hundreds of summer visitors gathered every 75
minutes or so Wednesday to watch the famous geyser erupt into the
smoky sky.
   ``Fantastic,'' said Alain Dukan of France. ``We're not afraid of
the fires and we're not worried about it. They say fire is part of
the forest.''
   In South Dakota, firefighters worked around the clock to dig a
fire line around a 2,200-acre blaze that burned out of control in
heavy woods within two miles of Rapid City, and the fire was
declared 80 percent contained today. The fire destroyed 22
structures, including seven houses.
   On Wednesday night, officials thought 2,000 people had evacuated
their homes, but they said today their best estimate was that only
1,000 people left their homes. About half of them were allowed to
return home today.
   Don Kopp, a fire commander, said Wednesday the blaze was the
work of an arsonist.
   ``Whoever's doing it, they could burn down half of the Black
Hills if they want,'' said Kopp, adding that authorities have been
investigating a string of about 50 fires dating to May which they
suspect were set by the same person.
   He said a cigarette with a match inside was used to start the
fire that was spotted Tuesday. Such a device would smolder for a
time before bursting into flame.
   ``I'm not sure what we need to do to catch them, but we need to
catch them,'' Kopp said. The suspected arsonist has set as many as
to eight fires in one day, he said.
   In Idaho, a temperature inversion kept winds mercifully light as
crews worked to keep a 1,700-acre fire away from about 50 homes in
the Boise National Forest, 35 miles north of Boise.
   ``The fire is pretty active and moving to the southeast,'' said
Karen Palmer, Forest Service fire information officer. ``We don't
have a big handle on how much it's burned because there's so much
smoke.''
   Winds helped Alaska's largest fire grow to 409,000 acres, said
Sue Mitchell, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman. Most Alaska
fires were in remote areas and were let alone because they don't
threaten people or property.
   In Washington, more than 350 firefighters battled a fire fanned
by 20 mph winds and temperatures near 90, which raced across the
ridge of the Cascade Mountains on Wednesday, tripling its size to
3,600 acres within a few hours. Firefighters in northeastern Utah,
meanwhile, used a rainstorm to contain a 5-day-old,
fireworks-caused blaze that charred 1,955 acres in the Flaming
Gorge National Recreation Area.
   Firefighters also contained a lightning-sparked wildfire that
burned an estimated 3,400 acres of remote terrain in northwestern
Arizona. About 50 people evacuated because of a 650-acre blaze in
Montana expected to go home today. About 70 homes were evacuated
Wednesday at Coulterville, Calif., because of a brush fire blamed
on a careless smoker.
   In Yellowstone, Hodel voiced confidence in the National Park
Service's controversial ``let it burn'' philosophy for wilderness
areas in which people, buildings or roads are not endangered. But
he said the excessively dry conditions might make a difference.
   ``The problem is to decide when you have a prescribed burn or
when you have a fire you want to fight,'' Hodel said. ``In the dry
conditions, they're taking the view that any fire that begins they
will try to fight it.''
   Ben Clary, Yellowstone assistant superintendent, said park
officials largely will follow the existing policy on natural fires.

   President Reagan said today the nation is
regaining its ``religious and moral bearings'' but must do more to
overcome promiscuity, drug use, pornography and a drifting away
from church and family values.
   ``An overwhelming nine out of 10 Americans pray,'' Reagan said.
``Audiences for religious books are growing. The modern
communications media are being used for evangelism.''
   In a speech to the Student Congress on Evangelism at the
Washington Convention Center, the president said his administration
``has worked hard to reflect this return to basic values.''
   Reagan ticked off a host of steps in recent years, including
enactment by Congress of the Equal Access Act of 1984, giving
voluntary religious groups the right to meet after school on the
same basis as other groups. He also cited longstanding
administration positions in support of returning prayer to the
classroom and reversing the Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortions.
   Reagan seldom goes to church, but has said he prays frequently.
   In his speech today, he said that ``I am not going to preach a
sermon.''
   At another point, the president talked to the young men and
women about the pressures teen-agers feel to have sex out of
wedlock.
   ``I'm sure that each of you believes that someday you'll find
someone to fall in love with _ and you will,'' he said. ``Sometimes
you may get frustrated and, yes, finding the right one may take
longer than you thought.
   ``But don't worry. It will happen,'' Reagan said. ``And that's
why it's so important for you not to pay any attention at all to
those who say that promiscuity is somehow stylish and rewarding.
No, the right thing to do is to wait for that one special person _
beginning now.''
   Reagan said that ``we must admit that in recent years, America
did seem to lose some of her religious and moral bearings.''
   He said pornography spread unchecked and was ``available
virtually on every magazine rack in every drugstore or shop in the
land.''
   Reagan said drug abuse ``spread through the nation like a fever,
attracting children as well as adults and involving drugs that were
once unheard of _ drugs like LSD and PCP.''
   While the president said those problems remain, ``I believe
there's been a change.''
   ``Now, although we Americans have done much to put our national
life back on the firm foundation of traditional values, there is
still a great deal to be done,'' he said. ``And so today, I want to
challenge you young people to see that our nation does still more _
still more to return to the life-giving values of faith and
family.''

   Michael Dukakis launched a seven-state
presidential campaign swing today after spending three days tending
to his duties as Massachusetts governor _ including signing off on
the final piece of a plan to balance his fiscal 1988 state budget.
   Dukakis met early today with fund-raisers and with supporters of
Jesse Jackson in Newark, then headed for Secaucus where he was to
visit a high-tech office park surrounded by a shopping center.
   One of the Jackson supporters, Newark Mayor Sharpe James, was
accompanying him, and Dukakis aides said the Democratic
presidential nominee would meet later in the campaign trip with
others who supported Jackson's presidential bid.
   In a speech prepared for delivery in Secaucus, Dukakis restated
the major points of his acceptance speech at the Democratic
National Convention last week.
   ``There are some who say we can't have a strong economy and
create opportunity for all our citizens,'' he said. ``Well, I know
from my experience in Massachusetts that equal opportunity and
economic growth go hand in hand. ... It begins with the recognition
that a strong economy needs three things: investment, innovation
and teamwork.''
   Dukakis ended his day Wednesday by attending the 30th annual
convention of the Pancretan Association of America, a group of
Greek-Americans who trace their roots back to the island of Crete.
   There, Dukakis repeated an Athenian pledge to public service he
frequently adds to campaign speeches, and then left the stage to
join a Greek dance.
   After New Jersey, Dukakis was heading to Cleveland and then to
Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Kentucky on Friday and Kentucky
and North Carolina on Saturday.
   The Democratic nominee resumed stumping a day after a poll was
released showing him with an 18-point lead over Republican George
Bush, the largest margin of the campaign and an sign of the boost
Dukakis received from last week's Democratic National Convention.
   Dukakis drew 50 percent support to 32 percent for Bush in the
NBC News-Wall Street Journal national survey of 1,770 registered
voters. He had led by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention
NBC-Journal poll. The latest poll, conducted by telephone Saturday
through Monday, had a margin of error of three points.
   Before leaving the Statehouse, Dukakis signed a number of bills
passed by the Legislature before it broke for a summer recess.
   Among them was a $124 million spending plan to close the books
on the fiscal year that ended June 30. The money was largely for
underfunded entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Aid to
Families with Dependent Children.
   Also signed into law by the governor was legislation to help
ease prison overcrowding through the purchase of modular units
containing 1,000 beds and a measure restoring a child-pornography
law struck down by the state Supreme Court. He also announced
distribution of $7.8 million in state and federal grants for victim
assistance programs.
   Dukakis dismissed Bush's repeated criticism of a Massachusetts
furlough program that, until it was amended, allowed passes to
first-degree murderers, including a man who escaped from a furlough
and raped a Maryland woman.
   ``I've got a record,'' Dukakis said, referring to statistics
showing his state's crime rate had dropped 13 percent in the past
four years. ``I don't know what the vice president's record is.''
   Dukakis was to spend the first half of next week at the
Statehouse before taking a Western campaign swing, during which
aides said he planned to interview several Jesse Jackson backers
interested in joining the Dukakis fall effort.
   Jackson himself should resume campaigning ``very shortly,'' said
Joseph Warren, Dukakis' general election coordinator and campaign
secretary.
   Dukakis also plans to campaign during the Republican National
Convention next month, although no itinerary was available.
   ``We do not plan any fishing or hunting trips during that
period,'' said Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, referring
to a fishing trip Bush took with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
during the first few days of the Democratic convention. ``We plan
to campaign.''

   The smoke-filled room is dying hard in Chicago.
   Some City Council members who opposed the new ban on smoking in
public places continue to light up in council chambers.
   ``How can they be so rude as to ignore a city law?'' asked
Alderman Raymond A. Figueroa, sponsored the clean air act that went
into effect Sunday.
   Alderman Thomas W. Cullerton, a smoker, started a hearing on the
matter during Wednesday's Council meeting. ``Wherever I put this
ashtray will be a designated smoking area,'' he said. ``I said it,
and I stand by it.''
   Alderman Victor Vrdolyak puffed away while fellow Council
members argued and insisted the ban does not apply to the meeting
room in City Hall. ``This is not a public area, period,'' Vrdolyak
said.
   The ordinance law bans smoking in enclosed public areas like
meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 seats
or more to set aside smoking and non-smoking areas. Bars and
private meeting rooms are exempt.

   A judge reminisced about the candy stores of

   Douglas County District Judge James Murphy on Wednesday
sentenced Christopher Bazer, 19. Bazer could have been sentenced to
death for the Feb. 18 shooting death of Mary Jirsak, 78.
   Bazer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in June, saying he
shot Miss Jirsak in the head during a robbery at her store. Two
other men convicted in the killing are awaiting sentencing.
   ``When I first heard about this case ... I thought back to the
time that I was 6 or 7 years old. In those days, they had a candy
store almost next to every school,'' Murphy said before the
sentencing.
   ``In the fall, October, I'd stop in a candy store. The sun would
come in that window. Light from the sun, the polished glass, would
light up my whole world.''
   Murphy shook his head, stood and strode out of the courtroom.
Bazer sat in silence with the lawyers and spectators until the
judge returned three minutes later.
   ``In any event, those memories have been spoiled by what
happened to Mary Jirsak,'' Murphy said, without mentioning his
absence.
   He then left the bench to embrace Karen Kojdecki, Miss Jirsak's
niece.
   ``Karen, judges care so much,'' he told her.
   Returning to the bench, Murphy addressed Bazer.
   ``I think what you did was deplorable, especially because of the
kind of person who was killed,'' the judge said.
   Bazer told the judge: ``I'm sorry about what happened, and if I
could change it I would.''
   The prosecutor and defense lawyer said they had never seen a
judge show such emotion in court.
   ``It was magnificent, wasn't it?'' asked Deputy Douglas County
Attorney Gerald Moran.
   ``The emotion was obvious,'' defense lawyer Alan Stoler said.
``I felt for the judge as much as I felt sorry for the family.''

<HEAD>Leaders Praised For Nominating Elected Official As Prime Minister</HEAD>

   Government critics on Thursday hailed
political leaders for nominating an elected official as prime
minister, but the nominee said Parliament's many factions will make
Thailand difficult to govern.
   Chatichai Choonhavan, a conservative former army general and
millionaire, formally announced his nomination as prime minister
Thursday.
   Chatichai, 66, a member of Parliament and an acting deputy prime
minister, reluctantly accepted the nomination Wednesday after Prem
Tinsulanonda refused another term for unspecified personal reasons.
Prem has served for eight years.
   ``The five political parties that will form the coalition
government have agreed to support the leader of the largest party,
and as that party's leader, I am pleased to accept the
nomination,'' Chatichai told reporters Thursday.
   However, before he accepted the nomination to a four-year term
as prime minister, Chatichai said on Wednesday: ``If I were prime
minster, I'm afraid it (the government) won't last more than three
months.''
   Chatichai was nominated by the leaders of five political parties
that hastily formed a coalition headed by Prem after no single
party won a plurality in Sunday's parliamentary election.
   Prem, a 67-year-old former army commander, called the elections
24 months early after dissolving Parliament, disbanding his
faction-ridden coalition government and nullifying a no-confidence
motion from the opposition.
   Chatichai's Thai Nation Party received the most votes in
Sunday's general election. The other four parties in the coalition
are the Democrat Party, the Social Action Party, the Rassadorn
Party and the United Democracy Party.
   Although Chatichai's party and the coalition partners hold 215
of the 357 seats in the lower house of Parliament, more lobbying
may take place before his name is submitted for approval to
constitutional monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej.
   In the past, Thailand's powerful military and senior bureaucrats
also were said to have been involved in the final choice of the
country's leader.
   Under Thai law, after elections the major parties select a prime
ministerial candidate, who does not have to be a member of
Parliament. Prem, for instance, does not hold an elective office.
   The coalition that backed Prem's last government, virtually the
same one that nominated Chatichai, was plagued by many divisions.
   Before his nomination, Chatichai also was not widely regarded as
a likely choice and has not enjoyed close ties with the powerful
military, as Prem did.
   However, Chatichai said Thursday he met with the army chief,
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and ``got military support'' for his
nomination.
   Chatichai's nomination was welcomed by students and other
government critics because he, unlike Prem, was an elected
official. After the nomination the students said they would end
protests they held before the nomination.
   ``Chatichai represents the people who voted him into the
government and we respect that,'' student leader Mana Treelayatewat
said Thursday.
   Mana, a leader of the 100,000-member Students Federation of
Thailand, said: `This is the first time in 10 years that democracy
can be developed and mature in Thailand. We have reached our goal:
premiership from direct elections.''
   Chatichai is a retired army major general and wealthy
businessman who has held the foreign affairs and industry
portfolios in earlier governments.
   Commissioned as an army officer in 1940, Chatichai served in
Thailand's brief war in Indochina in 1940-41, in World War II and
in the Korean War to which Thailand sent troops to fight with the
United Nations command. He also served as ambassador to Argentina,
Austria, Turkey, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.
   If Chatichai succeeds Prem, he is expected to follow a
conservative, pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development.

   A man robbed a family of tourists of their video
camera as they filmed St. Patrick's Cathedral, then tried to get
away in an off-duty jail guard's car but was shot to death on a
nearby crowded street, police said.
   The holdup occurred at evening rush hour Wednesday on
fashionable Fifth Avenue, ending when the correction officer fired
his gun inside his car, striking the robbery suspect three times in
the chest, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   Angel Santiago, 22, died later in the afternoon at Bellevue
Hospital, Howard said. A second suspect, Frank Felix Rodriguez, 19,
turned himself in this morning and was charged with robbery and
attempted robbery, police said.
   The officer, John Bonilla, 33, also shot himself in the foot
during the struggle and was in stable condition at Bellevue, Howard
said. The thief's body slumped over Bonilla's 5-year-old son in the
front seat of the car, but the boy was uninjured, police said.
   Joe Ashcraft of Muncie, Ind., said he was standing across the
avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral with his family at about 5
p.m., his video camera trained on the landmark church. Despite the
midtown crowds, two men pulled up in a car, one got out and
demanded Ashcraft's camera, he said.
   ``He said if you don't give me your camera and take it over and
put it in that car right now I'm going to shoot you,'' said
Ashcraft. ``At that point I didn't believe he had a gun.
   ``But then he pulled the gun and when he pulled the gun I gave
him the camera,'' Ashcraft said.
   As the robbers tried to speed off, police said, their car
collided with a taxi and then slammed into the side of a bus. The
pair then jumped out of their car and fled.
   One suspect, Santiago, ran onto a nearby street and tried to
escape by scrambling into Bonilla's car through an open window
before he was shot, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
Police believe Santiago was the thief who grabbed Ashcraft's camera.
   The gun used by Bonilla was his personal revolver, which he was
authorized the carry, Howard said.
   Police said Ashcraft recovered his video camera from the robbery
suspects' car, which they had left behind when they fled.

   A Muscat hotel has won the record for making
the world's longest shish kebab, the hotel claimed Thursday.
   The Ruwi Novotel cooked a 459-foot kebab, a feat now officially
recognized by the Guinness Book of Records, according to hotel
executives.
   Hotel manager Georges Sirguey, who thought up the idea of
cooking the longest ``Turkish-Moghulai'' kebab, said: ``We are
absolutely thrilled.''
   Sirguey said many people laughed when they heard about what his
hotel was doing. ``Well, it has been worth the effort. It was a
great team event. We feel very proud that the Guinness Book of
Records has recognized it,'' he said.
   The 330-pound kebab was cooked over 3,960 pounds of charcoal on
a giant barbecue.

   Eleven people died of gastroenteritis or
cholera in New Delhi on Thursday, and 1,106 new cases of the two
diseases were reported.
   Thursday's deaths raised the total number of victims nationwide
to 466 since monsoon rains began late last month. The rains set off
flooding that has caused sewers to overflow and contaminate the
drinking water in wells.
   In New Delhi, a city of 8 million people, at least 182 people
have died since the two diseases caused epidemics in early July.
   ``Our anti-cholera operation is on, but still we are getting
large numbers of new cases,'' health officer Brijendra Kumar said.
   Kumar said 1,106 new cases of the diseases were reported in New
Delhi on Thursday, and 34 of the cases were confirmed to be cholera.

   The interior of 10 Downing St., the office and
residence of British prime ministers since 1732, will be remodeled
starting next week.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's press office said Wednesday
the building will undergo its first major remodeling in 17 years.
   British taxpayers will pick up the $515,000 tab.
   Most public areas of the facility _ including the entrance hall,
Cabinet anteroom, Mrs. Thatcher's study and the dining rooms _ will
be redecorated.
   No work is planned on the Cabinet room or the private apartment
at the top of the building where Mrs. Thatcher and her husband
Denis live.
   Mrs. Thatcher has helped choose the colors of the new carpets
and curtains to be installed. The work is expected to be completed
in mid-September.

   It was a sweet decision indeed that will
enable two British cake decorators to show their talents their own
way at a convention here.
   June Melendy on Wednesday picked up an 88-pound box of specially
milled powdered sugar and other supplies from federal officials.
``It's in the back of my car and I'm not going to let it out of my
sight,'' she said.
   Authorities who on July 19 blocked importation of powdered
sugar, syrup and molasses said the shipment violated the U.S. sugar
import quota of 1.06 million tons.
   ``It seems like a relatively small thing,'' said Charles Conroy,
spokesman for the U.S. Customs Department in Houston. ``But we have
to protect U.S. sugar manufacturers and employees. If we allow
this, then someone will want to ship in, say, a couple of tons.
Then the U.S. industry would be in jeopardy.''
   But officials later determined that more sugar could be imported
this year without harm to the domestic industry, and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture gave Ms. Melendy the supplies, Conroy
said.
   Ms. Melendy, a spokeswoman for the International Cake
Exploration Society's Convention and Cake Show scheduled in Tulsa
next month, was trying to help British confectioners prepare their
demonstration at the convention when she originally ran afoul of
the law.
   Elaine MacGregor and Nicolas Lodge of Sussex, England, shipped
their supplies for the convention expected to draw 1,500 cake
decorators Aug. 11-14, Ms. Melendy said.
   ``They're artists,'' Ms. Melendy said. ``They use a very fine,
extra-refined sugar. They don't like our sugar. They're just like a
sculptor or painter. They prefer using their own equipment.''

<TEXT>
   Sexy luxury at Givenchy and casual luxury at Per
Spook were the keynotes of fashion Thursday, winding up the couture
showings for winter.
   Following Spook's show, a committee of 24 international fashion
writers awarded this season's Golden Thimble prize for all-around
excellence to Dior's couturier, Marc Bohan.
   Many of the designers came to the Palais Galliera fashion museum
with a few models wearing their designs, to participate in the
Golden Thimble ceremonies.
   ``Dior's mink-trimmed taupe suits actually made me jealous,''
said couturier Louis Feraud, a top-rated designer himself. ``They
were perfectly cut and made.''
   Givenchy's suits shown in the morning were also perfectly
tailored, with nipped waists, most narrow skirts short to an inch
or two above the knee. Givenchy has been an advocate of short
skirts, but also showed some longer lengths.
   There were bursts of color, even in the fabulous furs that went
with the dresses and suits. Fox, mink and sable were dyed ruby,
violet, pastel blue and yellow to go with outfits in different
dazzling tones.
   Cloth coats were usually luxurious cashmere, of course. One
model looked great in lavender with a dark purple windowpane plaid.
Bicolored suede and satin outfits were other appealing highlights _
royal blue or amethyst with a rust belt and toque, for instance.
   There were a few pants for daytime or evening, more often than
not dressed up with neat matador boleros and Spanish grandee hats.
   Givenchy's late-day wear was more siren-bright than usual,
though a few black beaded and sequined numbers cropped up. More
frequent were the satin dresses with sashes in tones like pink and
raspberry or emerald and magenta.
   Feathers, beehive-ruffled sleeves, black velvet appliques on
bicolored stretch jersey dresses added up to coquettish looks.
   Givenchy lenghthened a few hemlines to mid-calf, though the
dressy strapless-topped models were usually clinging to the torso,
flared below the knee.
   Givenchy's funny hats were remarkable, too. Besides boaters,
there were ripple or wave shapes, lace-edged tiny cones or
jigsaw-puzzle shapes, big fur rims on wide-brimmed hats.
   Ball gowns were sumptuous as always, whether slim and with
plunging decolletes or strapless with full taffeta skirts, some
with an iridescent effect.
   Per Spook chose some short styles _ minis and full shorts, even
though they were for the fall _ or much longer skirts and pants.
   As usual, the Norwegian-born designer presented
color-coordinated groups of clothes from day to evening, all
walking out at once, an appealing way of showing a modestly winning
collection.
   Combinations of champagne and ivory, royal blue and gray,
raspberry and green and sunny yellow and brown were lively rather
than loud.
   A soft mohair boxy coat topped a full chocolate brown cashmere
skirt, the smocked silk crepe blouse echoing the tones of the
outfit.
   There was plenty of luxury in this charming collection that
featured details such as sequined bodices over full leather skirts,
fitted and piped tweed military jackets, double-flounced clinging
suede dresses, excellent flannel pants with embroidered bolero
jackets, intricate seaming on bodices and hems of evening dresses.
   Spook's strapless ballerina-length gowns and the tiered silk
dresses in white and pink ribbons looked great for young debs or
sweethearts of Sigma Chi. These final adorable dresses were
appropriately called ``La Vie en Rose.''

<HEAD>Prices Soar In China For Brand Name Cigarettes, Spirits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government raised the base prices of its best
cigarettes and liquors Thursday in an effort to break up a thriving
black market, and it allowed state-run stores to set the retail
prices for the first time.
   Store managers said that on Friday they will raise the prices
even higher.
   The cost of a pack of a popular brand of cigarettes went up
nearly 400 percent, and the price of a fifth of a bottle of spirits
shot up 750 percent. But consumers were used to paying at least
that much anyway.
   The black market holds a virtual monopoly on top-quality
cigarettes and liquor in China. Private sellers bribe store
managers to sell them the goods wholesale and then resell them to
the public at inflated prices.
   On Thursday, brand-name cigarettes and liquors surfaced in
stores for the first time in about 15 years. Business was brisk.
   At the Xidan Market in west Beijing, manager Liu Dajiang said he
sold 1,500 cartons of cigarettes in two hours during the morning.
   ``We could have sold more, but we're saving them for tomorrow to
see what price they'll fetch,'' he said.
   China, the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco, has
300 million smokers.
   Across town at the Guandong Market, manager Zhen Ciping said
wines and cigarettes had been selling fast.
   ``Today we're experimenting, seeing which brands the masses
like,'' she said. ``Tomorrow we'll raise the prices of the popular
ones.''
   Customers complained the prices were too high, but they bought
anyway.
   ``The prices are the same as you can get from the private
sellers and that's too high,'' said customer Zhang Zhiping, holding
four cartons of popular Zhonghua cigarettes at the Xidan Market.
   The cigarettes went up almost 400 percent from 49 cents to $1.90
a pack.
   Thursday's price increases mainly affected 13 name-brand
cigarettes and 13 famous-brand spirits, although the costs of some
B-grade items also jumped.
   China is experiencing its highest inflation since 1949. Consumer
prices last month were 19 percent higher than in June 1987. Last
year, the previous high, inflation hit 7.2 percent.
   In May, the government raised the prices of vegetables, pork,
sugar and eggs as part of a far-reaching economic reform program to
end state controls of prices. Economists hope to increase
production and raise the standard of living.
   In announcing the increases Monday, the State Council, or
Cabinet, said it would let the price of the 26 brands be determined
by the market.
   Managers in state-run stores said that meant they could set
prices and reap a profit from their sales, something unheard of a
few years ago.
   According to the managers, the government set a base price. If a
store is able to sell the items for more, it can keep the
difference.
   At Guandong Market, manager Zhen said she planned to let the
workers share the profit. At Xidan, Liu said it would be invested
in the store.
   Managers said Thursday they would have no problem selling some
items for a profit.
   ``We're not even selling Maotai yet,'' Ms. Zhen said, referring
to China's popular sorghum liquor whose base price rose 750 percent
Thursday from $5.40 to $40.50 for a fifth of a gallon. ``We're
waiting to see what the market will bear.''
   But several problems were immediately apparent with the
government's plan to price the profiteers out of business.
   Only a few stores had the name-brand goods, and they had enough
for just a few days.
   Also, prices in the state-run stores still were generally below
those of the black market. Store managers said they expected
profiteers to continue to buy large quantities of cigarettes and
liquor at the state-run stores.
   ``Then they'll turn around and make a profit on our goods once
we run out,'' a shop manager said. ``This problem won't be solved
in a flash.''

   A couple who met in the 1920s and were
married for 62 years died of heart failure within an hour of each
other.
   ``He adored her from the first time he laid eyes on her, right
up to the last time he laid eyes on her,'' said Betty Ann Rose, the
daughter of Benjamin and Ruth Lippsett, who died Tuesday at 86.
   ``It's listed as heart failure, but that is not what they died
from,'' Rose said. ``He stayed until he knew she was gone and
didn't need him anymore. That's the way they wanted it.''
   Mrs. Lippsett died while nurses attended to her in Rose's house.
   ``We told Dad,'' Rose said. ``He saw her, laid down, cried some
tears and within the hour he stopped breathing.''
   Lippsett, 89, was a letter carrier.
   They are survived by Rose, a son, nine grandchildren and seven
great-grandchildren.

   Attorneys for James Messer Jr. turned to the
U.S. Supreme Court after a federal appeals court refused to block
his execution tonight for the beating and stabbing death of his
8-year-old niece.
   The application for a stay of execution was filed today with
Justice Anthony Kennedy.
   The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles also considered a
clemency appeal.
   Messer, 34, was scheduled to die in the electric chair at 7 p.m.
for the 1979 slaying of Rhonda Joan Tanner.
   Prosecutors said he abducted his niece from school by telling
officials her father had been hurt in a construction accident, then
attempted to molest her. He attacked the girl when she fought him
and left her to bleed to death.
   Messer would be the 13th person executed in Georgia's electric
chair since the state resumed executions in 1983.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier today refused to
stop the execution.
   Messer's lawyers have contended that he is mentally incompetent
and thus, under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, cannot be put to death.
   Officials at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center
near here moved Messer to a holding cell next to to the death
chamber Wednesday afternoon, said John Siler, spokesman for the
Corrections Department.
   Messer came within 15 hours of execution two years ago but won a
stay from the U.S. Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   A city patrolman with a heart says he has
been writing one or two bogus traffic tickets a week in the names
of non-existent motorists for about 18 months.
   ``I just could not bring myself to write tickets,'' said
Patrolman Michael Ghrist. ``I started seeing the human beings
behind the drivers' wheels.''
   Ghrist, 36, a 17-year veteran, has been suspended for 25 days.
   Police Chief Richard Dotson concluded that Ghrist wrote
fictitious tickets to maintain ``high enforcement statistics.''
   Chief Jefferson District Judge Donald Smalley said this week
that a computer listing of all the tickets Ghrist has written since
1981 shows that more than 1,000 are in the names of people for whom
state transportation employees could not find Kentucky driver's
licenses.
   ``We have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious,''
Smalley said.
   However, the official letter from Dotson to Safety Director
Thomas Kuster recommending Ghrist's suspension says only what
Ghrist has admitted _ that he wrote one or two phony tickets per
week over a year and a half.
   Kuster said Wednesday that he was unaware that more than 1,000
questionable tickets had been written.
   And Lt. Col. John Aubrey said the police internal affairs unit's
investigation of Ghrist would be reopened because of that
information.
   Each person who gets a traffic ticket is sent a letter by
District Court notifying him of his court date. If the person fails
to show up, a second letter is sent.
   If two court appearances are missed, the court sends the ticket
to the state Transportation Cabinet. That agency sends the ticketed
driver a letter warning he will lose his license if the ticket
isn't resolved within 20 days, said cabinet spokesman Mark McDaniel.
   This year, for the first time, the cabinet began sending tickets
that don't match driver's licenses back to District Court, Smalley
said.
   In a batch of about 50 returned by the state in March, clerks
discovered that Ghrist had written 29, police Maj. Hank Rausch then
asked them to do a more extensive check, Smalley said.
   Checking tickets that Ghrist wrote since 1981 for people whose
names began with the letters A through C, the clerks found about
250 for which the state had been unable to locate drivers'
licenses, Smalley said.
   He said the clerks made another check of tickets that Ghrist had
written that were never resolved and found 1,050.
   Ghrist said he admitted writing the fictitious tickets when
called to Dotson's office a few weeks ago. He said he also wrote
legitimate tickets.
   In his letter, Dotson said he considered recommending that
Ghrist be fired, but decided to be more lenient because Ghrist was
not motivated by greed. For example, he did not receive special pay
given to officers for court appearances.
   ``Rather, Officer Ghrist seems to have been motivated by a
self-imposed peer pressure to maintain high enforcement
statistics,'' Dotson wrote.
   Assistant City Law Director Paul Guagliardo said Ghrist may have
violated state law. However, Guagliardo said he never determined
which statute Ghrist could have violated because District Court
officials told Dotson they didn't wish to prosecute.
   Since January, Ghrist has been assigned to drive a vehicle that
cruises expressways to help stranded motorists.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI,India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the dusty days of summer, when
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end, New Delhi
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains.
   ``In the West, the rains are depressing. In India they are a
time of great joy, release, beauty and romance,'' says Khushwant
Singh, a noted author and journalist.
   As the rains come, the dust settles. Parched gardens suddenly
turn green. Temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers.
   But the monsoon has its sad side.
   The rains that started early in July ended two years of drought
in northern India, promising good crops at last, but they also
unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370
people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by
contaminated water. The death toll in New Delhi from contaminated
water approached 100. A city official said more than 7,100 others
had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis.
   For New Delhi, the downpour broke the stifling heat, but
telephones went dead, potholes multiplied or grew deeper, and
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and
wells.
   At the first delicious moment of the monsoon, though, the
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant.
   ``The monsoon ... for most Indians ... is not only the source of
life, but also their most exciting contact with nature,'' says
author-journalist Singh.
   When the clouds first burst open over New Delhi, dozens of
half-naked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the Yamuna River.
   ``It's always like this,'' said Gulab, an elderly woman watching
the fun. ``The children love to play in the rain, but they
invariably get sick.''
   More than 5,300 people have been treated this year for
gastro-enteritis and cholera in New Delhi. At least 182 have died,
most of them children.
   Maya Rao, a university teacher who has lived in New Delhi for
many years, described New Delhi's monsoon this way:
   ``There is muck and mud all over, mosquitoes attack you in
hordes, diseases spread like vice. It's impossible to get to places
on time, given the state of the roads, and calling people on the
phone is such a nuisance _ half the phones are dead.''
   Then, she added, there's the humidity.
   ``The moment the rain stops, you sweat to death.''
   Even so, Ms. Rao went on, she can't imagine life without the
monsoon.
   ``What could be more delightful than eating `bhutta' (roasted
corn-on-the-cob) on your terrace as the grey-purple skies melt into
rain?''
   One city official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could do
no work during the monsoon.
   ``It's too beautiful just to relax, sit and watch the rain,'' he
said, as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window.

<HEAD>Government May Sell Vanity License Plates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced a new scheme to help
finance its car licensing department _ the sale of vanity plates.
   The hottest item, says Transport Secretary Paul Channon, may be
D1 ANA, which would appeal to fans of Princess Diana, wife of the
heir to the throne.
   Other likely attractions are DAV 1D, F1 RST, CHR 1S, F111 JET,
and F1 DEL.
   Because such plates must have at least one digit, zeroes pass
for the letter O, 1 for I and 5 for S.
   Channon told Parliament on Wednesday the plates will go on
auction in an effort to cut $1.7 million per year from vehicle
registration costs.
   Unlike American motorists, who for a fee can order the license
plate lettering of their choice, British drivers now depend on the
computer to churn out lucky combinations of letters and digits.
   Some of the plates slip through the system, however, and 70,000
change hands each year, some fetching thousands of dollars. Private
dealers advertise the so-called ``cherished'' plates in newspapers
and auto magazines.

   A woman who has been accused of killing
her only child with a butcher knife dreamt she would become rich if
she conducted such a sacrifice, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Shahida Khatun, 32, was charged with murdering her 4-month-old
baby in southern Pirojpur district on Sunday. If convicted, Mrs.
Khatun could received up to 14 years in prison, according to The
New Nation newspaper.
   The English-language paper quoted police officials as saying the
woman attacked her child after waking from the dream.

   The chairman and senior Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee today accused the White House of
trying to ``set up'' Congress to make it appear a news leak about a
covert action plan for Panama began on Capitol Hill.
   In fact, said Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and William Cohen,
R-Maine, they were receiving inquiries from reporters on Tuesday
even before the CIA briefing on the plan got under way.
   ``I think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up
members of Congress to make them appear the source of the leak,''
said Cohen. ``I am offended by it.''
   Cohen said he suspected the tactic may have been designed to
damage chances for legislation opposed by the administration to
require notification of the House and Senate intelligence
committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan signed by the
president.
   The bill stemmed from last year's Iran-Contra investigation and
is designed to tighten current law, which requires only that
unspecified ``timely notice'' be given to congressional overseers.
   Boren said he also believed the leak could have been designed to
give the appearance that the Reagan administration is doing
something about the situation in Panama, which has become a
political liability for GOP presidential candidate George Bush.
   Both Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., suggested Wednesday that the administration may have
leaked the purported plan to the news media to create the illusion
of a stepped-up campaign against Noriega.
   The reported plan was first disclosed by the Washington Post and
the Los Angeles Times, but neither newspaper provided details.
President Reagan and administration spokesmen were uniformly silent
Wednesday when asked about it by reporters.
   Informed comment about the alleged plan was scarce, and even
D'Amato and Schroeder admitted their remarks were speculative
because they had not received an official briefing.
   Published and broadcast reports said the activities fall short
of a paramilitary operation, such as kidnaping Noriega to bring him
to the United States, where he faces drug charges.
   D'Amato suggested that news leak came from the White House
``during this political season'' to create the impression that the
administration is doing something about Noriega and drug
trafficking in Panama.
   Schroeder also said Reagan authorized the activity to give the
appearance of stepping up the campaign against Noriega.
   ``It's politically motivated,'' she said.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who broke with the Noriega-led
government in February, said in an interview he is pleased that the
administration has maintained a no-negotiations policy toward
Noriega since the collapse of a U.S. bid in May to encourage him to
surrender power.
   But Sosa, who shares the administration view that ousted
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle is the legitimate leader
in Panama, said he had not been briefed on the reported covert
action plan. This contradicted a source quoted in The Washington
Post.
   Sosa also said he doubted widespread reports that President
Reagan had informed Delvalle of the plan during a telephone
conversation on July 15.
   ``As far as I know, the conversation did not touch on that,''
said Sosa, who continues to serve at Panama's embassy here in
defiance of the Panamanian government's efforts to appoint its own
envoy.
   The administration has frozen Panamanian government assets in
the United States as part of broad policy of economic denial
against Panama. At one point, the administration was considering
dropping the drug charges against Noriega if he would leave Panama,
but talks with the military strongman broke down in May.
   The administration then withdrew its proposals and said it would
not take part in further negotiations.
   Offers by Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo and former
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to start up an alternate
negotiating process have not borne fruit.
   Noriega has refused to discuss Panama's political future since
the collapse of the U.S. initiative.
   The administration had hoped to negotiate Noriega's surrender of
power by Aug. 12, the fifth anniversary of his ascension as
commander of the Defense Forces.
   Asked what he expects Noriega to do on that day, Sosa said the
Panamanian leader will either do nothing or he will step down and
announce his candidacy for presidential elections set for next May.
   Any such elections, Sosa said, ``obviously will be a farce'' if
they are under Noriega's control.

   Local residents donated $3,600 to four British
dancers who could not afford to fly home because they were
underpaid by a nightclub, their lawyer's office said Thursday.
   Keiji Shishioka of the Muramatsu-Hijii law office identified the
dancers as Colette Zacca of London, Kate Allegaert of Essex, Dawn
Sheridan Young of the Isle of Wight and Dawn Elaine Leach of Kent.
   Shishioka said the women began working in April at a nightclub
in Sapporo, northern Japan under a contract stipulating each would
receive $1,000 a month plus room and board and their flight
expenses to Britain.
   But each received only $150 after working for about two months,
he said.
   Shishioka said a court ruled June 23 the club must give the
women their back wages but the dancers were unable to collect from
the nightclub.
   The women received the donations from residents who read
newspaper accounts about their troubles. The dancers will leave for
home on Saturday.

<HEAD>New ``Ring Cycle'' Production Receives Praises and Boos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HOFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYREUTH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The audience cheered the singers
and musicians but booed the director after the premier of a
modernistic version of Richard Wagner's ``Ring Cycle'' that opened
the Bayreuth Wagner Festival.
   After the performance Wednesday night, an international cast of
singers and musicians under the direction of Paris Orchestra
conductor Daniel Barenboim received enthusiastic applause. For the
first time this year, the orchestra includes 11 musicians from
communist East Germany.
   But East German director Harry Kupfer, who attempted to turn the
old German myths into a symbolic depiction of the modern world,
drew boos.
   Kupfer, according to the Hamburg-based weekly Stern magazine, is
seeking to present the Wagnerian tragedies as a portrayal of
present times by showing ``aspects of our threatened world.''
   ``The audience should learn something,'' the magazine quoted
Kupfer as saying. ``They must not just close their eyes and enjoy
the beautiful music. They should reflect on the meaning.''
   Kupfer set his production in modern times and on a modern
street, which he says is ``part of the traveled road in human
history.''
   Stage settings are built of bits and pieces of ordinary,
every-day materials.
   A dragon's cave, where the stolen Rhine gold is stashed, is made
from an old piece of sewer piping. Valhalla, the home of the gods,
is presented as a cube of neon lights, suspended above a
smoke-covered stage floor.
   The gods travel to and from their Valhalla home in a
rainbow-colored, glass-enclosed elevator.
   Modern social themes were also woven into Kopfer's presentation.
   The three goddesses of fate are portrayed as Bedouin gypsy
women, weaving their threads of fortune from 42 television antennas.
   Kupfer said the use of trenchcoats and other types of overcoats
for costumes is intended to depict ``the cold discomfort of the
homeless.''
   The opening performance marked the 600th presentation of the
``Ring Cycle'' at the Bayreuth festival, and the second attempt at
bringing the Wagnerian tragedies into a modern setting.
   In 1976, French director Patrice Chereau directed a production
of the opera set in the 19th century, which, like Kupfer's
offering, was booed by the audience and received negative reviews.
   Wagner's ``Ring Cycle'' will be performed three times at this
year's festival, which ends August 29. Tickets for all of the
festival performances have been sold out since November.

<HEAD>Bush Looks For Running Mate; Dukakis Begins Seven-State Tour</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis ethics comments in top 4 grafs, picking
up in 2nd graf pvs, Bush has; trims at end</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush said today the guessing game about his
vice presidential running mate is inevitable and he hopes it won't
demean anyone involved. Democrat Michael Dukakis, speaking on
ethics, said Bush should have been calling for Edwin Meese's
resignation since last spring.
   Dukakis, in a speech in Secaucus, N.J., also referred in
dismissive fashion to Bush's statement Tuesday that he would create
a White House ethics office headed by a senior counselor.
   ``In a Dukakis White House, the ethics office will be in the
Oval Office, not someplace down the hall,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee said.
   Meese has announced his resignation and said he will soon leave
his post as attorney general, but Dukakis said Bush, the Republican
vice president, should have been demanding Meese's ouster last
April after top Justice Department officials resigned.
   Bush has begun sending out questionnaires seeking background
information from potential running mates, including former rival
Jack Kemp.
   The vice president, in comments to reporters outside his White
House office today, named no names.
   He said, ``The process is going along in an orderly fashion. ...
Hopefully, it won't be demeaning to anyone.''
   As for the growing list of Republicans believed to be among
potential candidates, Bush said, ``You can't avoid speculation.''
   Dukakis arrived in Newark, N.J., at mid-morning and was to visit
a day care center in Secaucus later in the day before heading for
Cleveland. He will return to Boston Saturday night after visiting
seven states.
   Before leaving the Statehouse on Wednesday, Dukakis continued
his duties as Massachusetts governor by signing a number of bills,
including crime legislation and the final piece of a plan to
balance the 1988 budget.
   Dukakis dismissed Bush's repeated criticism of a Massachusetts
furlough program that allowed passes to first-degree murderers. The
program was later amended, but not until after one of the prisoners
escaped from a furlough and raped a Maryland woman.
   ``I've got a record,'' Dukakis said, referring to statistics
showing his state's crime rate had dropped 13 percent in the past
four years. ``I don't know what the vice president's record is.''
   He was riding a post-convention wave of enthusiasm, with the
latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll giving him an 18-point
lead over Bush.
   Running mate Lloyd Bentsen was in San Francisco after telling a
business women's group in Albuquerque, N.M., that ``the gender gap
... wasn't created by accident.''
   He told the National Federation of Business and Professional
Women, which Bush had addressed Sunday, that the GOP record on the
Equal Rights Amendment, equal pay and other issues pushed women
into the Democratic camp.
   Bush, the certain nominee at the Republican National Convention
in New Orleans Aug. 15, remained in Washington while more feelers
went out for prospective running mates.
   Kemp, the New York congressman, and Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico were among those receiving requests for background
information, Republican sources said.
   Kemp aide Marci Robinson said the congressman met with Robert
Kimmitt, a Washington attorney who is helping screen possible
running mates, and would provide the material to the Bush campaign
within a week.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu has said he received a
questionnaire from Bush campaign officials.
   In addition to Kemp, the names mentioned most frequently in the
speculation include Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and
California Gov. George Deukmejian. Several women's names also crop
up, including Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Dole's wife,
Elizabeth, a former secretary of transportation.
   Aides to Sen. Dole, Deukmejian, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, Sens. Richard Lugar of
Indiana and Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Illinois Gov. James
Thompson all said they had not received questionnaires.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, met briefly with Democratic National
Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in Chicago to discuss Jackson's role
in campaigning for the party's presidential and local candidates.
Neither side would give details on what was discussed.
   The former presidential candidate said late Wednesday he has
been trying to meet with the foreign minister of Iran in an attempt
to discuss the possible release of Americans being held in Lebanon.
   ``No meetings have been set, but I have been making appeals,
through diplomats, to set up a meeting,'' Jackson said in a
telephone interview from his Chicago home.
   Today, however, he said, in an interview that ``no meeting has
been set, and no meeting has been sought.''
   In an interview published today in USA Today, Bush said of a
possible Jackson role as an unofficial envoy, ``It shouldn't
happen. We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. The
administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the
United Nations. We don't need any loose cannons rolling around the
deck.''
   Jackson's reaction: ``My moral appeals and humanitarian pleas to
gain the release of American hostages is a consistent one. In some
sense I have never stopped trying to get hostages free, and George
Bush has never started.''
   ``We should not lower the dignity of this effort to gain the
freedom of Americans held hostage with name calling,'' Jackson
added when asked about Bush's comments. ``If he wants to operate in
that level, that's his judgment.''
   Jackson has said he will campaign for Dukakis, but details have
not yet been worked out.
   Surveys have been suggesting Dukakis got a boost following last
week's convention. In the latest poll _ a telephone survey of 1,770
registered voters conducted Saturday through Monday _ Dukakis
received 50 percent support to 32 percent for Bush. Dukakis had led
by 10 points, 46-36, in a pre-convention NBC-Journal poll.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   An undercover drug agent said today that one
of the federal government's most significant cocaine investigations
ended prematurely when word of the operation appeared in the news
media days after the CIA said it would leak the material to expose
Nicaraguan government drug smuggling.
   Appearing behind a screen to conceal his identity, Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Ernest Jacobsen said the 1984 leak
ended ``one of the most significant cocaine investigations in DEA
history,'' which he said could have led to the arrest of the entire
leadership of Colombia's cocaine cartel. The cartel was operating
inside Nicaragua at the time, Jacobsen said.
   The hearing was the first in a series by the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime into whether Reagan administration officials
condoned drug smuggling and other criminal activities to further
its Central America policy _ especially winning aid for the Contra
rebels.
   The panel also is studying whether administration officials
obstructed law enforcement operations, as may have occurred in the
1984 operation.
   Jacobsen told the subcommittee that convicted drug pilot Barry
Seal was working for the DEA in the sting operation. The agent
described Seal's extensive contact with the Colombian cartel and
with Federico Vaughn, identified by Jacobsen as an official of the
Nicaraguan interior ministry.
   According to Jacobsen, the CIA placed cameras in an airplane
that Seal flew to Nicaragua in 1984 to film the loading of cocaine
at a military airstrip.
   He said the pictures had been developed at CIA headquarters near
Washington and then ``taken to the White House.''
   ``The CIA wanted to release them to the press, to show the
Sandinistas were dealing in cocaine,'' Jacobsen said.
   The agent said DEA officials initially convinced the CIA to
change its mind, but shortly afterwards, a story on the operation
appeared in The Washington Times.
   He said that story ended the operation, and the DEA frantically
began to make all the arrests possible at that point.
   The subcommittee chairman, William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said the
motive of the planned leak on the Sandinistas appeared designed to
influence Congress to approve aid to the Contras.
   Hughes said a CIA witness was invited to testify on the agency's
role in the operation, but he notified the committee he would
refuse to cooperate on Fifth Amendment grounds of
self-incrimination.
   More than 100 subpoenas have been issued for witness testimony
and the production of documents, Hughes said. Judicial grants of
immunity have been obtained to compel testimony of six persons who
refused to cooperate, invoking their Fifth Amendment privilege.
   No immunity grant has been issued for the CIA witness, and
Hughes said there has been no decision on pursuing the agency's
testimony.
   Seal in February 1986 was assassinated in a Baton Rouge, La.
machine gun attack, as he pulled up in his Cadillac at a Salvation
Army halfway house. He was confined there part-time on a six-month
sentence for narcotics and bank fraud convictions.
   In an interview Wednesday, Hughes said, ``We're looking at
whether ... an obstruction of justice'' caused the end of the Seal
operation. ``The whole operation was aborted because of leaks to
the media.''
   Seal had contacts with the Colombian drug cartel and ``came in
contact with at least one Sandinista,'' Hughes said.
   In October 1985, Seal told a presidential organized crime
commission that he quit his job as an airline pilot because
``smuggling was so simple, so lucrative.'' He said he easily eluded
detection to fly tons of cocaine into the United States for a top
fee of $1.5 million.
   ``I have landed clandestinely in probably every South American
country there is,'' Seal said. ``There is no problem if you have
the necessary contacts and dollars with you.''
   Seal told panelists how fly-for-hire pilots take off and land
without interference from authorities in Colombia, Nicaragua and
other Latin American nations.
   Seal said he transported cocaine into the United States while
working for an illicit drug cartel he said was as sophisticated
``as any Fortune 500 company.''
   He displayed night-vision goggles, telephone encryption devices
and high-technology message-sending units. ``I don't believe
there's any paramilitary group better equipped than my former
associates,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a
trans-Atlantic Navy destroyer with the alleged help of five U.S.
sailors was turned over to a Naval investigator today to be
escorted home.
   ``I just want to go home,'' Suzanne Twomey, 16, of Cork,
Ireland, told Wake County Judge Fred M. Morelock, who placed her in
the investigator's custody for a flight to New York's Kennedy
Airport and then on to Ireland later today.
   Miss Twomey had apparently slipped onto the USS Conyngham while
it was on a courtesy call in Cork Harbor and was discovered aboard
the guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to Norfolk,
Va., after a 10-day crossing.
   She was found in a 2{-foot-wide, 15-foot-long, 3-foot-high
compartment above a refrigeration unit that she shared with
electrical wiring and pipes.
   Five sailors accused of helping her stowaway were jailed at the
Norfolk Naval base. If charged and convicted, they could receive up
to five years in prison and a $2,000 fine for aiding an illegal
entry into the United States.
   ``There are no options but for her to return to Ireland,'' said
Daire O'Criodain, a spokesman at the Irish embassy in Washington.
   O'Criodain said Miss Twomey is a minor and has no passport.
``She is in legal limbo. ... Our course is to get her out of this
limbo as quickly as possible and get her home.''
   Miss Twomey was released Wednesday from Rex Hospital after being
treated for an undisclosed ailment. She was being taken to Atlanta
for a return flight when she became ill, forcing an emergency
landing here, authorities said.
   Assistant District Attorney J. Franklin Jackson told the judge
today that Miss Twomey was a runaway and would be considered an
undisciplined child under the American court system. The prosecutor
wished Miss Twomey luck.
   ``I need it,'' she said.
   Miss Twomey, who originally told Navy officials she was
orphaned, is the eldest of four children and has run away several
times _ once having to be returned from Spain, said a Dublin police
spokesman, who would not give his name.
   Her parents, John and Christine Twomey, had reported her
missing, according to the spokesman.
   Mrs. Twomey told the Cork Examiner newspaper it was ``a pure
disgrace'' that her daughter was able to slip through security and
stay on board. The sailors who kept her hidden ``should not be
allowed to get away with this,'' she said.
   The Navy is investigating how Miss Twomey was able to slip
aboard the destroyer and be undetected for so long, said Lt. Cmdr.
John Lloyd, spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet Surface Force. The
girl did not get into any secure areas, Lloyd said.
   ``We are cooperating with the Navy to keep this as small a black
eye as we can,'' said William Bitner, of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Norfolk office.
   Archie Galloway, another fleet spokesman, said the girl was
treated for dehydration Saturday at the Portsmouth Naval Hospital.
He said a full physical found no health problems.
   A Delta Airlines spokesman said the ariline had been asked by
the Navy on Wednesday to take Miss Twomey home but refused.
   ``We don't feel we're medically equipped to handle such a
happening, should the same thing happen ovver the middle of the
Atlantic,'' Billy Berry said in Atlanta, referring to the girl's
illness during the flight to Atlanta.

   ``L.A. Law,'' the NBC series about
the glamorous legal eagles at a Los Angeles law firm, received 19
Emmy nominations today, while cable shows won 15 in their first
outing against the networks.
   Nominations for ``L.A. Law'' included best drama series, best
lead actor nominations for Michael Tucker and Corbin Bernsen, best
supporting actress for Susan Ruttan, lead actress for Jill
Eikenberry and Susan Dey, two writing nominations for former
producer Terry Louise Fisher and four directing nominations.
   ``We like to think we don't insult'' the audience, said
executive producer Steven Bochco. ``We have good stories and that
great ensemble group. We draw inspiration from their ability.''
   Bernsen got a wakeup call from his mother telling him he had
been nominated for his role as the lecherous divorce lawyer Arnold
Becker.
   ``She just said, `I'm sorry I woke you up, but congratulations.'
I said, `What for?' and she told me I got a nomination,'' he said.
Last year, Bernsen not only got a nomination, but his mother,
actress Jeanne Cooper, was nominated as best guest performer for
her role on ``L.A. Law'' as his mother.
   The CBS cult favorite ``Beauty and the Beast,'' about the
unrequited love affair between a half-man, half-beast living
beneath New York City and a beautiful woman lawyer, and NBC's ``The
Golden Girls,'' a comedy about four retired women with tart tongues
and lingering passions, each received 12 nominations.
   Betty White, who won three years ago for her role on ``The
Golden Girls,'' said of her third nomination: ``Isn't this
exciting? I cant believe it. I don't take it lightly. It's your
peer group saying they like you.''
   NBC once again led the field with 114 nominations, followed by
CBS with 87. ABC earned 75, while PBS had 27, and Showtime, Home
Box Office and Fox Broadcasting Co. garnered six each. The Disney
Channel captured two nominations, with one for the Turner
Broadcasting System, while syndicated shows earned 13.
   The Television Academy of Arts & Sciences allowed cable
programming to compete with regular broadcast television in this
year's 40th annual Emmy Awards because cable shows are now
available to a wide national audience.
   The nominations were announced from more than 4,500 entries. The
awards will be presented live on Fox Broadcasting on Aug. 28 from
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' captured 11 nominations and ABC's
``thirtysomething'' 10. CBS' ``Frank's Place,'' a so-called
``dramady'' which has been put in limbo by the network, got nine
nominations.
   Earning eight nominations each were the CBS drama ``Foxfire''
and NBC's ``St. Elsewhere,'' which just completed its final season.
   ABC's miniseries ``Baby M,'' the NBC miniseries ``Gore Vidal's
Lincoln,'' and the new syndicated series ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' each earned seven nominations.
   Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' received four to put
it on top of all the cable shows.
   Other major cable nominations included: ``Shelley Duvall's Tall
Tales and Legends'' on Showtime, for best children's program; Gilda
Radner as outstanding guest performer in a comedy series for ``It's
Garry Shandling's Show,'' and Billy Crystal for best individual
performer in a comedy or variety show for HBO's ``All Star Salute
To The Improv.''
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' was nominated for best drama series and
Ron Perlman was nominated as best lead actor for his role as the
half-man, half-beast.
   CBS' ``Cagney and Lacey'' a previous Emmy winner that was
recently canceled by CBS, received two nominations, both for lead
actress for co-stars Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly. Both have won that
award in the past.
   ``The Golden Girls,'' winner in the past two years as best
comedy series, was nominated again along with stars Rue McClanahan,
Bea Arthur, and Betty White, all for lead actress. Estelle Getty
was nominated for best supporting actress in a comedy series.
   Herb Edelman and Geraldine Fitzgerald were nominated as best
guest performers in a comedy series in an episode from the show
about four retired women living in the same house in Miami.
   The nominees for best comedy series, besides ``Frank's Place,''
``Golden Girls'' and ``Cheers'' were NBC's ``Night Court'' and
ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' a new show about growing up in the
1960s, told from the perspective of a 12-year-old boy.
   Nominations for outstanding drama series went to ``Beauty and
the Beast,'' ``thirtysomething,'' ``L.A. Law'' and ``St.
Elsewhere.''
   In the outstanding miniseries category, nods went to four shows
based on real or historic events and one fictional account of a
ruffled old lawyer in London.
   The nominees are ``Baby M,'' NBC's ``Billionaire Boys Club'' and
``Gore Vidal's Lincoln,'' ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' and PBS'
``Rumpole of the Bailey.''
   Actress Ann Jillian's movie about her battle with cancer, NBC's
``The Ann Jillian Story,'' was nominated as best drama or comedy
special, along with CBS' ``The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank,''
CBS' ``Foxfire,'' NBC's ``Inherit the Wind'' and NBC's ``The Taking
of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story''
   The Governors Award this year will go to William Hanna and
Joseph Barbera, of Hanna-Barbera, for their many animated shows,
including ``The Flintstones,'' ``The Jetsons,'' and ``The Smurfs.''

<HEAD>Postal Service Seeks `Seat Belt' for Stamps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN W. CHALFANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service began a 16-month,
$700,000 quest Thursday to lick the problem of stamps that don't
stay stuck, urging industry to produce an adhesive to serve as a
``seat belt for a stamp.''
   Gordon C. Morison, a senior assistant postmaster general, made
it clear during a daylong conference at Battelle Memorial Institute
that the post office was serious about development of a superior,
water-activated adhesive.
   ``Unfortunately, the news that we have made in the last few days
is that we're spending a lot of money on something the press
perceives as insignificant,'' Morison told about 100 adhesive
industry executives and technical experts.
   He said the Postal Service would spend nearly $90 million this
year for stamps, sales of which would generate about $8 billion.
   ``I don't believe there is a private company, including those
that publish newspapers or sell their wares over the airwaves, that
would hesitate to invest $700,000 to lower the cost of their
product while making it perform better. That is exactly what we are
doing,'' Morison said.
   ``We take it seriously because we know how important that stamp
is to every American consumer,'' he told reporters during a break
in the conference. ``We really believe that we have to have a stamp
that operates very well.''
   Adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail
is sorted manually or mechanically. But the arrival of high-speed,
automated processing, in which stamps are coated with a compound
that activates processing equipment, has generated a need for a
stronger adhesive that will keep a stamp on an envelope.
   ``The mail is moving very quickly through our system. In doing
that, you are again putting a great deal of stress on the stamp,''
Morison said.
   He compared it to a speeding car running into a brick wall,
sending a passenger without a seat belt into the windshield.
   ``You have the same thing in sorting mail. The letter is moving
down the processing stream, and all of a sudden it stops. As soon
as it stops, it's that same kind of force as the car hitting the
brick wall,'' Morison said. ``What we are doing is developing an
adhesive that will serve as a seat belt for a stamp.''
   The Postal Service has heard from customers whose letters were
destroyed or returned because the stamps fell off, he said.
   ``The problem ... hasn't reached major proportions. But it is
clear that it will as the speed of mail processing continues to
increase as it must. The time to act is now, and we are turning to
the adhesive industry for help,'' Morison told the conference.
   Dr. Vincent McGinniss, the program project manager at Battelle,
said industries will develop potential new adhesives and supply
samples to the institute for extensive testing and evaluation.
   ``Ultimately, we will print real stamps that ... we will put
into the mail stream. We'll take them back out, find out if they
stuck, and if they stayed on then do the evaluations, a lot more
testing,'' McGinniss said in an interview.
   Battelle, a not-for-profit, multinational research and
development organization, will write adhesive specifications which
the postal service can use in buying the product from suppliers.
   Although the research should produce stickier stamps, no change
in taste is anticipated.
   ``Taste is a very personal thing. What we've always sought in
taste, and where we think we are, is neutral and bland. And we'd
like to stay neutral and bland,'' Morison said. ``Taste is in the
tongue of the users, and this contract really has nothing to do
with that.''

<DATELINE>WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronauts flying a jet
modified to act like a space shuttle make steep 19-degree dives
toward the desert floor Mondays through Fridays, flashing at 230
mph 20 feet above a runway of packed, white gypsum.
   Each time, they have to deal with a malfunctioning computer,
broken landing gear, a non-working radio or some other problem
generated by a sophisticated computer aboard the Grumman Gulfstream
II jet.
   In addition to all their other shuttle training, astronauts also
must practice for a possible landing at the alternative runway in
the desert at White Sands.
   ``It would be terrible if you had a good mission and messed it
up with a bad landing,'' said Alex Paczynski, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's project manager at White
Sands Space Harbor.
   Shuttle commanders Rick Hauck and shuttle pilot Dick Covey
practiced landings Wednesday in the modified jet.
   ``There's a humongous computer on board that takes the flight
characteristics of the shuttle and the flight characteristics of
the airplane and matches them together,'' Paczynski said.
   The computer can simulate a shuttle bringing back a heavy
payload, or a stiff wind, or a system malfunction or a combination
of problems.
   Hauck and Covey are scheduled to go up on the next shuttle
flight, aboard Discovery, in September or October.
   A simulated countdown leading to a test firing of the shuttle's
main engines ran into a snag Wednesday and was delayed 24 hours.
NASA engineers hope to fix a small gas leak in a vent line
associated with a steering engine without taking Discovery off the
pad and into a hangar, a move that could delay the launch as much
as two months.
   The shuttle's primary landing site is Edwards Air Force Base in
California, a dry lake bed with plenty of room to make up for a
less-than-perfect landing.
   But if it rains at Edwards, Hauck and Covey could end up gliding
down to one of the two dazzlingly white, criss-cross runways at the
White Sands dry lake bed.
   If they land at White Sands, on a dry lake bed between the San
Andreas Mountains and White Sands National Monument, they will use
a runway that has been leveled out a little better since Jack R.
Lousma landed the shuttle Columbia there on March 30, 1982.
   Engineers used lasers to check the smoothness of the runways,
Paczynski said Wednesday as he led reporters on a tour of the
100-square-mile complex in the middle of White Sands Missile Range.
   They also leveled and flattened the surface 300 feet wide on
either side of the 300-foot-wide landing strip, in effect making
the runway 900 feet wide. At 35,000 feet long, the landing strips
are about three times as long as those at commercial airports.
   July, August and September are the rainy months at White Sands,
when half of the annual 12 inches of rain falls. The ``dry'' lake
bed was decidedly wet Wednesday because three-quarters of an inch
of rain had fallen the night before, but it was still firm.
   ``Notice how the bus won't get bogged down when it comes to this
wet spot,'' Paczynski told reporters as their bus approached a
50-yard-long puddle. ``There's a very hard mantle here 2 inches
under the topsoil. That's why you could land an orbiter here even
if (the strip) were underwater. They wouldn't, but they could.''
   When the shuttle lands on the gypsum flats, it's as if it were
landing on a mile-thick, 7-mile-long piece of Sheetrock, the panels
used for interior walls.
   Prevailing southwesterly wind carries gypsum crystals from the
lake bed to the famous dunes shimmering in the distance.
   The wind and the sharp gypsum crystals created havoc the one
time a shuttle landed here.
   The de-service and mating area, where the astronauts disembark
and where the shuttle is hoisted aboard a Boeing 747 for the flight
back to Florida, was so dusty that officials feared for the
vessel's safety. So they've moved the area to a less dusty spot in
the lee of the mountains, Paczynski said.

<DATELINE>WINTER PARK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city commission has approved a
measure that urges a ban on ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a
movie one commissioner called ``garbage'' because of its fictional
portrayal of Jesus.
   The 3-2 vote by the commission in this well-to-do Orlando suburb
asks Universal Pictures not to distribute the film unless it is
changed ``to eliminate the fictional material which defames the
character of Jesus Christ.''
   It also urges theaters to reject the film, and asks residents to
contact the filmmakers and express their opposition.
   ``This is the type of garbage they want to put in our movie
theaters,'' said Commissioner Tom Ivey, who proposed the resolution
Tuesday.
   Ivey, who is running for a Florida House seat, said the script
portrays Jesus as a weak, unstable man and a sinner.
   The film, tentatively set for release in September, has drawn
criticism elsewhere. Last week, fundamentalist Christians picketed
the home of MCA-Universal Chairman Lew Wasserman in Los Angeles.
   Publicist Catherine Leach of MCA Inc., parent company of
Universal, said Wednesday that filmmaker Martin Scorcese ``firmly
believes that this film is a religious affirmation of faith.''
   She called efforts to prevent the film's release censorship.

   Pentagon officials on Thursday defended the
use of prescribed stimulants to Air Force pilots on long solo
flights and said no recent crash has been linked to drug use.
   ``None of the crashes in Germany was linked to drug use,'' said
Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman. ``No crashes anywhere have been
related to drug use.''
   A West German television network reported Wednesday that U.S.
Air Force pilots there take Dexedrine to stay alert in flight and
take the sedative Seconal to sleep afterwards.
   Concern has grown in Europe following the crashes of five F-16
jet fighters in West Germany within three months this year.
   The West German network ARD quoted an unidentified U.S. Air
Force officer as saying that pilots take Dexedrine ``so that they
are able to fly when they haven't gotten enough sleep or don't feel
fit enough.''
   Consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, appearing on
the ABC-TV program ``Good Morning America, said his group was
concerned about ``a military that has to depend upon using uppers
and downers to perform well.''
   Wolfe said if commercial pilots used such drugs they would be
fired or grounded.
   ``Imagine the scenario of a fighter pilot flying one of these
planes having an hallucination and pressing the wrong button,
particularly if there is a bomb on board,'' he said.
   Hoffman and other officials said U.S. military pilots use such
stimulants on long flights across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
and not on exercises over populated areas.
   ``The Air Force does not routinely prescribe medication to air
crew members, but on long flights where pilot fatigue could present
a significant safety risk, stimulant and sedative medications may
be authorized by the major command surgeon general,'' said Hoffman.
   ``Dispensing of these medications is rigidly controlled. Routine
use of these medications is never advised. The individual crew
member makes the decision to take or not to take the medication,''
he said.
   Such use, he said, was confined almost exclusively to ``long
flights. Dexedrine, Seconal and Temazepam (a stimulant) are
prescribed almost exclusively for transoceanic solo missions in
single-seat aircraft.''
   The Air Force was not considering any changes in the practice,
which has been standard for as long as 30 years, spokesmen said.
   None of the other services, the Army, Navy or Marine Corps,
prescribe such drugs for pilots, Hoffman said.
   And the Navy Medical Command issued a statement saying that it
neither prescribed nor permitted the use of such drugs on flights
by Navy pilots.
   ``The missions and environments in which Navy and Air Force
pilots fly are different,'' the Navy statement said. ``Navy pilots
seldom fly long, uninterrupted flights in single or two-seater
aircraft which Air Force pilots do regularly in deploying aircraft
across the ocean on training exercises.''
   ``As a matter of policy, naval aviators are not given
prescription stimulants or depressants for use during or after
flight,'' the Navy statement said.
   ``Only caffeine in the form of coffee and triptophan in the form
of warm milk are permitted for these purposes,'' the Navy statement
said.
   Col. Russell B. Raymond, chief of the Aerospace Medical
Consultants Division of the Air Force surgeon general's office,
said in an interview on ABC-TV that the service does ``on occasion
prescribe medication to our pilots, but these are under very
special circumstances.
   Raymond said he did not know how often the drugs are taken but
said they have been used for ``25 to 30 years, probably longer.''

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan canceled a $1.3 billion development
plan in the Israeli-occupied lands Thursday as part of what
officials called a plan to give the PLO responsibility for the 1.5
million Palestinians living there.
   Jordan state radio said the announcement was made after a
Cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister Zaid Rifai. The radio said
Jordan would continue its ``national role as a confronation state
and a prime party in the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
   A rebellion among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories began Dec. 8 and has come largely under PLO direction.
More than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.
   A senior Jordanian official confirmed reports in the Arab press
that King Hussein is making broad changes in Jordan's relationship
with the Palestinians, but the radio quoted Rifai as saying the new
measures ``will not harm the national unity among Palestinians and
Jordanians in the kingdom.''
   The five-year West Bank development plan was established in
1986, by agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, to
finance health, education, housing, and cultural and Islamic
affairs projects in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The West Bank was under Jordanian rule until Israel captured it
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel captured the Gaza Strip from
Egypt.
   Although Israel occupied the West Bank, Jordan continued paying
salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there, and West
Bank representatives sit in the Jordanian Parliament. The 60-member
upper house now includes 30 from the West Bank.
   Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million people are of Palestinian
origin, including the entire population of the West Bank.
   A senior Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said of Thursday's action:
   ``This is part of King Hussein's decision to free himself from
representation of the Palestinian people and leaves the doors open
for the PLO to shoulder responsibility on its own. The king's
decision also reflects the PLO's wish to take over all Palestinian
affairs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.''
   According to the radio, Jordan will ``urge friendly and
brotherly countries to continue their support and financial
assistance to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.''
   On Wednesday, the Saudi newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat quoted Rifai
as saying ``decisive developments'' were planned to give
Palestinians greater responsibility as an entity.
   Al-Qabas, a Kuwaiti newspaper, predicted Wednesday that Hussein
would dissolve Parliament and change the government, with Marwan
Qassem, the royal court minister, the strongest candidate to
succeed Rifai.
   It said Hussein had decided to dissociate himself from the
Palestinian question and let the PLO take the responsibility.
Al-Qabas, which usually is well-informed on Jordanian affairs, said
Rifai would become Hussein's personal representative.
   Israeli leaders said they expected no major change in Jordan's
policy.
   Prime Minster Yitzhak Shamir said: ``We still see the Jordanians
as a partner in direct peace negotiations. ... This doesn't change
anything as far as we're concerned.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who has encouraged Jordan to form
a joint negotiating delegation with moderate Palestinians, said of
Hussein's action: ``What he's doing is not a change in policy but a
purely technical move.''
   Peres said it would have no effect as long as the king ``does
not declare war on us and does not close the Jordan bridges'' or
prevent Palestinians from holding Jordanian passports.

<TEXT>
   Two factions in Cambodia's civil war
exchanged sharp words Thursday, indicating that major hurdles
remain on the road to peace after four days of unprecented talks.
   Despite the differences, the informal talks resulted in a broad
convergence of views on key issues and on the urgent need for a
political settlement, said a closing statement from Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who hosted the gathering.
   Participating were Vietnam, its ally Laos, the Vietnam-backed
Cambodian government, the three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnam's
occupation and the pro-guerrilla Association of Southeast Asian
Nations: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Brunei.
   Their representatives gathered at the old presidential palace in
Bogor, 40 miles outside Jakarta.
   Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction,
called Vietnam's contention that the Cambodian meeting had reached
broad agreement ``a shameless lie'' aimed at perpetuating its
occupation of Cambodia ``forever through its puppet regime.''
   He accused Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, of
rejecting all guerrilla peace proposals at the talks. Vietnam, he
said, must unconditionally withdraw from Cambodia instead of
linking a pullout to demands that steps be taken to insure the
Khmer Rouge does not return to power.
   Thach's statements to reporters were aimed at ``deceiving the
international community'' he added.
   Meanwhile, Hun Sen, the Cambodian leader, told a news conference
that his party and the guerrilla resistance ``have made efforts to
find common ground. It was a pity that the Khmer Rouge rejected our
proposal.''
   He said they proposed a national reconciliation council with the
former guerrilla alliance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in
charge that would include political but not military participation
by the Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to halt bloody attacks
on its western border by the Khmer Rouge, who had killed hundreds
of thousands of people in trying to transform Cambodia into a
primitive agrarian society during its 1975-79 rule.
   The communist Khmer Rouge is now allied in a guerrilla coalition
with the forces of Sihanouk, Cambodia's former monarch, and Son
Sann of the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   Thach said Wednesday the talks had resolved ``the most difficult
problems'' and there was agreement in general terms though not on
details. One agreement was the need for steps to prevent a Khmer
Rouge return, he said.
   On Thursday, Thach said he was ``half-happy'' with the talks and
declared Vietnam was ``determined to have a political solution
before 1990,'' its self-imposed deadline for withdrawing its more
than 100,000 occupation troops.
   A desire to avoid a post-1990 civil war led the conflicting
parties to the Bogor talks.
   The participants agreed to form working groups of senior
officials of all sides to study issues of contention and, by year's
end, make recommendations for another round of talks.
   Even Singapore's hard-line foreign minister, Suppiah Dhanabalan,
called the talks ``a very important psychological breakthrough,''
as the first meeting among all the warring parties.
   Meanwhile, Hun Sen, head of the Phnom Phen government, confirmed
he would meet with Sihanouk in Paris in October for a third round
of talks. They met in France in December and January, and Sihanouk
canceled a planned third round.
   Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia from 1941-70 and is widely
considered essential to a future government, recently resigned as
president of the resistance coalition, saying the Khmer Rouge was
killing his men.
   Sihanouk refused to go to Bogor, where the talks were held. But
he reclaimed center stage by meeting Wednesday in Jakarta with his
guerrilla partners and Hun Sen. His son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
represented Sihanouk at Bogor.
   The statement issued by Alatas, the host, said participants
agreed the two key issues of the Cambodian problem ``are the
withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea, to be carried out
within the context of an overall political solution and the
prevention of the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices of
the Pol Pot (Khmer Rouge) regime and to ensure the cessation of all
foreign interference and external arms supplies to the opposing
Kampuchean forces.'' They also agreed on the need for definite
timetables and an international presence to supervise these
processes, it said.
   Alatas said no official communique was issued because the talks
were informal. Diplomatic sources said Singapore and Thailand, the
two hardest-line states on the issue, were upset by what they saw
as Vietnam besting the others, and led opposition to a communique.

<HEAD>Kennedy Fears Acting Attorney General Has `Blinders On'</HEAD>

   Sen. Edward Kennedy said Thursday he finds
acting Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen's optimistic
assessment of Justice Department morale ``somewhat incredible'' and
said he is concerned Christensen ``is going over there with
blinders on.''
   Christensen was the third Justice Department nominee in two days
to reject testimony by former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
that the department had been gripped in a ``deep malaise'' when he
resigned March 29 to protest Attorney General Edwin Meese III's
continued tenure.
   At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Christensen said that when he came to the Justice
Department early last month he quickly saw that its operations were
running effectively.
   ``I think morale is high,'' Christensen testified.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned Christensen's portrayal twice
during the hearing and repeatedly asked the nominee why he hadn't
met with Burns and former criminal division chief William Weld
about their protest resignations stemming from Meese's refusal to
step down in the face of an ongoing criminal investigation.
   Weld said he quit because he felt Meese had committed ethical
violations and probably commited crimes as well.
   Christensen said he found it inappropriate to inquire since he
might be in a position at some point of having to make judgments of
his own.
   Kennedy said that should have prompted Christensen ``to ask more
questions, not fewer.''
   Christensen said he enjoys a close working relationship with
Meese, meeting with him usually two or three times a day, and that
he has formed no judgments of his own about ethical or legal
questions regarding the attorney general.
   Hours after independent counsel James McKay sent an 814-page
report on Meese's activities to a panel of judges on July 5, Meese
announced he would resign, and he plans to leave next month.
   McKay conducted a 14-month inquiry into Meese's actions at the
request of attorney E. Bob Wallach on behalf of scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project, plus Meese's
tax filings and his stock holdings in Bell telephone companies.
   McKay concluded Meese ``probably'' broke two tax laws and twice
violated a federal conflict-of-interest statute. But McKay decided
not to indict the attorney general. Meese sharply criticized the
findings and said he had been exonerated.
   Kennedy said he found Christensen's comments ``somewhat
incredible'' and added that he is concerned the nominee ``is going
over there with blinders on.''
   The acting deputy attorney general replied, ``I don't think so,
senator.''
   The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
is conducting an ethics inquiry of Meese's activities in the wake
of the report by McKay, who decided against seeking an indictment
of the attorney general.
   The office could issue a highly critical report of the attorney
general's ethics.
   ``I would expect that office to discharge its responsibility,''
Christensen said. ``I would certainly not interfere with that
office discharging its responsibility.'' At another point in the
hearing he said, ``I would support what they are obligated to do.''
   If confirmed as deputy attorney general, the 62-year-old Salt
Lake City attorney almost certainly will be serving under Richard
Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania GOP governor whose nomination
for attorney general has been widely praised by Republicans and
Democrats. Thornburgh's confirmation hearing is set for Aug. 5.
   Christensen, who became acting deputy attorney general June 1 _
his first government job _ was president of the Utah State Bar in
1975-76.
   At their confirmation hearing Wednesday for permanent positions,
Francis A. Keating II and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said the
department was running well in the final days of Meese.

   A millionaire businessman who promised to bankroll
a new life for a welfare mother of five faces criminal charges and
a $1.4 million judgment in a bank fraud and is not free to spend
his money, attorneys said today.
   James Gisclair had offered to buy a house for Anita Hunter and
her family and provide her with a job, a college education, a car
and a nurse to care for the children.
   But court records show that a subsidiary of Capital Bank won a
civil judgment against him after alleging in state court that
Gisclair defrauded the lender out of $1.3 million. The judgment
includes interest on that amount.
   The criminal charges stem from the civil case, according to
Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, who filed charges
against Gisclair two weeks ago in federal court accusing him of
making a false statement to a bank.
   Capital's attorney, Hugh Culverhouse Jr., said today that he
understands Gisclair must satisfy any outstanding judgments before
he can freely spend his money.
   The attorney added that in a deposition filed after the
judgment, Gisclair said his businesses were worthless.
   Gisclair did not immediately return calls to this Boca Raton
office today.
   He said Wednesday that he made his promise to Hunter because he
felt like ``nobody was doing more than lip service to make a
difference'' about poverty.
   ``I kept driving by and seeing the homeless,'' he said. ``It
started to really bother me. ... I honestly became consumed by the
urge to do something about it.''
   
   
   For 28-year-old Anita Hunter, struggling to raise her children,
including a month-old son, in a drug-ridden inner-city Miami
neighborhood dubbed ``The Hole,'' his offer is a ``fairy tale''
come true.
   ``I can't believe this is happening to me,'' she said. ``It's
just a miracle from God. I've struggled and hoped for so long to
get my children out of this neighborhood and into a safe
environment.''
   Gisclair, a 43-year-old New Orleans native and principal owner
of six Boca Raton enterprises, including a real estate management
company and a restaurant, found the family through Livia Garcia of
Miami's Community Development Department. He told her he wanted to
help real people he could see and talk to.
   ``My idea is to see exactly where my money is going and be able
to measure its success,'' said Gisclair, who has four children.
``The idea is to get Anita to become self-sufficient to the point
where she can pay her own rent on the house, pay her own bills and
do everything on her own someday. I plan to pay for everything
until she reaches that point.''
   He said he would find a home for the family in Boca Raton,
Delray Beach or Deerfield Beach, about 100 miles north of Miami.
Ms. Hunter would work during the day and attend Florida Atlantic
University at night so she could pursue her goal of becoming an
accountant.
   It's not the first time Gisclair has tried the idea.
   An earlier effort to help a welfare mother with four children
failed because ``she was totally unwilling to participate,''
Gisclair said.
   ``And then one day she asked me to pay half of her rent because
her ex-husband didn't come through with the money. I volunteered to
pay it directly to her landlord, but she said, `No, send it to me.'
That was enough for me to realize I was being connned.''
   That's why Gisclair's has attached some conditions.
   ``I just want Anita to be honest with me,'' he said. ``I want
her to become self-sufficient, and she has promised to have no more
children. I will see to it that she gets medical care as well to
take care of that.''
   Ms. Hunter said Gisclair's conditions are ``tiny'' compared to
the chance he's giving her family. She said the neighborhood she
lives now is so dangerous she doesn't let her children _ Kentrail,
10, Krystal, 4, Grady, 3, Alex, 1, and Antjon, 1 month _ play
outside.
   ``It's like a fairy tale,'' she said. ``These things don't
happen every day and they never happen to me.''
   Gisclair said he was shocked by the family's poverty when he met
Ms. Austin on a visit to her cramped, one-bedroom apartment Friday.
   ``There was one bed and a hot plate,'' he said. ``But the place
is immaculate and so are the children.
   ``They're well disciplined; they're clean. If you took one look
at their smiles you'd want to do the same thing.''

<HEAD>Chemical-Germ Weapons Research Could Endanger Nearby Communities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Research into chemical and biological weapons
could be dangerous to surrounding communities, according to a
safety review, but the Pentagon said Thursday its safety
precautions are enough to protect against accidents.
   The Pentagon has ``stringent and necessary safety precautions''
for its chemical weapons program, said Thomas J. Welch, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for chemical weapons.
   Welch defended the Pentagon's safety standards in an appearance
before the Senate Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee,
which has been investigating the safety of the two programs.
   A subcommittee staff report earlier this year found that the
Pentagon lacked firm safety regulations for research into
biological weapons and outlined safety lapses in both chemical and
biological programs.
   The Pentagon last year began building chemical weapons for the
first time since 1969 and research is conducted at government and
private laboratories in about 150 locations throughout the country,
according to the subcommittee.
   The United States has formally renounced the use of biological
warfare since 1969, but the Pentagon spends an increasing amount of
money to develop defenses for a variety of types of germ warfare
that might be used against U.S. forces.
   Spending for biological and chemical research has increased
sharply since President Reagan took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980,
the total research was $63.5 million, compared with the $348
million figure for fiscal 1986.
   The General Accounting Office, in a report presented to the
committee, said there are a number of potential dangers among the
chemical and biological research sites scattered around the United
States.
   Dr. Neil H. Levitt, a former microbologist at Fort Detrick, Md.,
told the panel that in 1981 the Army lost about two quarts of a
potentially dangerous virus used as a vaccine against a highly
infectious disease and has not been able to account satisfactorily
for the missing virus since then.
   Military officials dispute Dr. Levitt's contentions and said the
virus vaccine had been sterilized by a technician.
   Welch said the Pentagon, in its chemical weapons program,
``applies stringent safety, storage, maintenance, use and
accounting requirements for all internal and contractor facilities
that use chemical agents.''
   Those requirements included unannounced inspections and
rehearsals for hypothetical accidents, he said.
   In Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, Max Friedersdorf, the U.S.
delegate to the Conference on Disarmament, named officially for the
first time the location of five chemical weapons production
facilities in the United States.
   They are located at: the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, in Colorado;
the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas; Muscle Shoals in Alabama;
Newport Army Ammunition Depot in Indiana; and Aberdeen Proving
Ground in Maryland.
   However, an Army spokesman in Washington, Lt. Col. John Chapla,
said chemical weapons currently are only produced or stored at Pine
Bluff and Muscle Shoals.
   ``These are locations which are at present or were at one time
involved in the production of chemical weapons,'' Chapla said of
the five sites named by Friedersdorf. At Rocky Mountain and
Newport, there is no chemical weapon production, testing or storage
going on.''
   Aberdeen is used to test some components of the current
generation of chemical weapons, but is not used to produce, store
or test the binary, or dual chemical weapons that the U.S. military
now uses, Chapla said.
   ``Our focus now is the production of binary chemical,
principally at Pine Bluffs,'' Chapla said.
   Some work is also done at Muscle Shoals on one of the chemicals
used in the production of binary weapons, but the weapon is not
deadly until the two chemicals are combined, he said.
   ``The binary program is such that you never have a complete
weapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kept
together and they will not be mated until just before firing,''
Chapla said.
   As for biological weapons, the Pentagon has proposed building a
$5.4 million biological aerosol test facility at the Dugway Proving
Ground in Utah.
   At Thursday's hearing, Welch said that in response to the
subcommittee's report last May, the Pentagon will require that its
biological research program comply with biosafety standards set by
the federal Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes
of Health. Previously, that compliance was only a recommendation,
not a requirement.
   The GAO noted that in addition to Pentagon requirements, the
programs also must meet local and state safety standards.
   The Defense Department approaches safety for the programs in two
different ways, the study said.
   For private companies doing research into chemical weapons, the
Pentagon has ``developed and implemented a reasonably systemic and
comprehensive approach for evaluating and managing risks,'' the GAO
said. But it recommended that the Pentagon work harder at looking
at potential accidents.
   No Pentagon safety requirements have been done for biological
weapons research, the GAO said. Instead, the Pentagon ``relies on
an existing safeguards system that was developed by the
biomedical'' establishment.
   ``Biological defense research and development poses recognized
health and safety risks, thus adequate protective measures need to
be implemented,'' the GAO warned.
   The review noted that about ``10 percent of the biological
defense program contracts involve genetic engineering techniques to
study disease processes. The use of genetic engineering and
recombinant DNA molecules has been a subject of concern because of
the risks associated with the possible creation of modified agents
and their potential release into the environment.''
   For that reason, the GAO noted, the Pentagon requires the
contractors to follow NIH guidelines for research involving genetic
engineering.

   Criminal mischief charges against actor Sean
Penn were dropped Thursday after he agreed to pay for damage to a
photographer's car.
   Penn, known for running afoul of the law with his fists, was
accused of kicking in the driver's side door of New York Post
photographer Paul Adao's car on July 3. Adao said he was in the
driver's seat of his car, photographing Penn and his wife, pop
singer Madonna, when Penn attacked.
   Adao said it will cost the 27-year-old actor about $800 to fix
the car door. He said Penn will also pay the cost of renting a car
while Adao's auto is being repaired.
   Penn, the star of ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' ``The Falcon
and the Snowman'' and ``Colors,'' was released from jail in Los
Angeles on Sept. 17 after serving more than half a 60-day sentence
for violating probation by punching a movie extra.
    He had been on probation for fighting with a man he accused of
trying to kiss Madonna at a Los Angeles nightclub in 1986.

the East River, they found the 282-foot Trump Princess docked,
leaving no room for the schooner.
   The campers departed _ ``not liking Mr. Trump too much,''

   Federal judges in Los Angeles and Bridgeport, Conn., today
refused to unseal search warrant information on the Pentagon
bribery probe, saying release of the documents might compromise the
investigation.
   News organizations had requested the information, which consists
of affidavits filed by prosecutors in order to gain warrants to
search defense contractors' offices.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon in Los Angeles reversed a
ruling by U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann earlier this month that
the documents from the California portion of the investigation
should be unsealed.
   ``On balance,'' Kenyon said, ``the public's interest in a
complete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its need
for or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at this
time.''
   The government has released minor portions of some documents but
fought for secrecy on more important information.
   Earlier this month in Los Angeles, the government released 30
pages that showed federal agents wiretapped telephone conversations
to gather information on Northrop Corp., Teledyne Electronics and
Litton Industries.
   In Bridgeport, U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly said the
documents sought by The Hartford Courant ``are extremely detailed
and contain information that would certainly endanger the ongoing
grand jury proceedings.''
   The newspaper had sought documents on searches at Connecticut
offices of Norden Systems, a United Technologies Corp. subsidiary.
   ``There is a right under the First Amendment of access to court
documents,'' the judge said. ``But at this early stage, the right
is a qualified and limited one.''
   The government agreed, however, to unseal very limited parts of
the documents that describe the person who swore out the affidavit
and the premises searched, and the introductory section of the
affidavit.
   Ralph Elliot, the Courant's attorney, said the ruling was ``more
limited than other judges have made and it is disappointing.''
   The Pentagon investigation centers on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for inside information useful in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Norden is suspected of benefiting from inside information to
build a battlefield communication system for the Marines, according
to other documents already released in the investigation.
   Earlier this month, Norden withdrew from the bidding for the
communications system, citing the suspicions raised by the
investigation.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr., said today, however, that a
Norden program not disclosed so far is the only one under
investigation. He declined further comment.
   Norden officials did not immediately return telephone calls.
   The Courant last week asked for release of documents related to
the June 14 search of Norden offices in Bridgeport, Trumbull and
Norwalk and a June 15 search of the Shelton home of James E.
Rapinac, a senior vice president.
   The information released today said federal agents searched the
East Norwalk office of Bill Kingston, Norden executive vice
president, and other areas of the building where his documents are
stored and his secretary sits.
   The documents also said agents went to Norden offices occupied
by Jack Richardson and Vice President Roger Engle, and other areas
of the building where documents, calendars, files and other
information they keep would be stored.
   It wasn't known what position Richardson holds.

<HEAD>Administration, Key Democrats Oppose U.S., Vietnamese Relations
Now</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and key House
Democrats on Thursday voiced opposition to any move at this time to
establish U.S. and Vietnamese diplomatic interest sections in Hanoi
and Washington.
   But administration officials held out the promise of full
diplomatic relations between the two former adversaries if
Vietnamese troops are withdrawn from Cambodia.
   Principal support for establishing diplomatic interest sections
in the two capitals came from a pair of Republicans, including Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who spent years as a war prisoner during
the Vietnamese war.
   ``It is a modest step,'' McCain told the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Southeast Asia.
   ``It's sole purpose is to speed progress in a number of issues,
including Americans missing in action, emigration of Amerasians
through the orderly departure program, the release of Vietnamese in
re-education camps and the continued Vietnamese occupation of
Cambodia.''
   McCain and Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., contended the time is ripe for
such a step because the Vietnamese have made it clear they will
leave Cambodia, because the Vietnamese economy is shattered,
because a new generation is taking power in Hanoi, and because an
opportunity exists to woo the Vietnamese away from the Soviet Union.
   ``Senator McCain and I agreed that the status quo was horribly
unacceptable and unsatisfactory,'' Ridge said. ``The parents of our
MIA's still wait for word on their missing heroes.''
   An interest section is the lowest type of U.S. diplomatic
contact with another nation and does not involve the establishment
of formal diplomatic relations of any kind. Officials of the two
nations involved generally use office space in an embassy of a
third nation.
   Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, said the administration believes that establishing
U.S. and Vietnamese interest sections now would harm U.S.
interests, hand Hanoi ``a major political victory'' and perhaps
rekindle Hanoi's determination to stay in Cambodia.
   ``We have refrained from establishing normal diplomatic
relations with Vietnam as a demonstration of our opposition to
Vietnam's illegal occupation of Cambodia,'' Sigur said. ``Were we
now to agree to the establishment of interest sections in our
respective capitals, this would represent a fundamental change in
our policy of supporting the diplomatic isolation of Vietnam.''
   Karl Jackson, deputy assistant secretary of defense for East
Asian affairs, said that establishing a U.S. diplomatic presence in
Hanoi now ``would encourage hardliners in Vietnam _ who do not wish
to leave Cambodia _ by removing the pressure.''
   ``We must keep the pressure on because it is working,'' he said.
``We must maintain the policy of ... no aid, no trade, no
normalization.''
   That policy will change eventually, but for the time being the
U.S. position must be ``Normalization _ yes _ fine _ but not now,''
Jackson said.
   As Thursday's hearing concluded, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
the subcommittee chairman, said he agreed that the time has not
come to establish diplomatic ties of any kind.
   ``I come away from the hearing even more convinced it would be
potentially counterproductive to proceed with interest sections at
this time,'' Solarz said. ``I think the downside is very clear. But
the time will come, and I hope it comes soon.''
   Sigur said progress is being made toward ending the Vietnamese
occupation of Cambodia and that a full dialogue is under way on
humanitarian issues.
   ``Given the current level of cooperation, we do not believe that
more formal diplomatic structures are required,'' he said.
   But Sigur said the U.S. opposition to setting up interest
sections now ``should not be seen as a sign that the administration
remains implacably hostile toward Vietnam.''
   ``We hold no malice toward Vietnam as a result of the war in
Indochina,'' he said.
   ``In fact we look forward to the time when we will be able to
enter into normal diplomatic and commercial relations with Vietnam
and have made it clear we are prepared to normalize'' if there is a
complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Cambodia.

<HEAD>Poll Shows National Womens' Group Favors Dukakis 3-to-1 Over Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A national group of business women
favors Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis by nearly
3-to-1 over Republican nominee-to-be George Bush.
   A straw poll released Thursday showed Dukakis preferred by 62
percent of the 507 women polled at the National Federation of
Business and Professional Women's Clubs convention in Albuquerque.
   Bush received 23 percent.
   BPW President Betty Forbes said nearly half of those polled are
Republicans and the survey ``shows women this year aren't going to
vote the party lines. They're going to vote the issues that concern
them.''
   Dr. Ethel Klein, a political science professor at Columbia
University, said at the convention that Bush needs to portray a
future different from the past eight years in order to close the
gender gap _ the pattern of women supporting Democrats in greater
proportion than men do.
   ``The key to this election is what the Republicans do to close
that gap and what the Democrats do to sustain it,'' Ms. Klein said.

   Pat Robertson, whose failed Republican
presidential campaign is more than $1 million in debt, has asked
supporters to donate $25 each to pay his bills, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   In a July 18 fund-raising letter, Robertson wrote that running
for president was more expensive than he first believed, The
Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk reported. He told
supporters that failure to pay off his debts now would result in
``years of struggle'' for Robertson's family.
   ``All of my future work as your champion would then be
injured,'' he wrote.
   Americans For Robertson, the religious broadcaster's campaign
organization, was nearly $1.2 million in debt and had $28,166 as of
June 30, his most recent report to the Federal Election Commission
showed.
   Robertson complained in his letter about the treatment he
received as a candidate.
   ``My faith was ridiculed. My motives and my words were
distorted. Lies were spread about my war record, my education and
my resume. My family was savagely wounded,'' he wrote.
   Returning to campaign rhetoric, he added: ``God does not want us
to turn America over to radical feminists, drug dealers, militant
homosexuals, profligate spenders, humanists, or world communists.''

   Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina
will be floor manager for Vice President George Bush at next
month's Republican National Convention in New Orleans, campaign
officials say.
   ``Because of his tenure in Congress and past experiences at
presidential conventions, Carroll knows all the key players around
the nation,'' said Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager. ``The vice
president thought he would be a natural for the job.''
   Campbell will act as the central figure for Bush inside the

floor leaders, all senators or governors, Atwater said.
   ``This is real big job, and one of the key jobs at the
convention,'' he said.

   The six-member team investigating the downing
of Iran Air flight 655 left the Persian Gulf on Thursday for its
home base in Tampa, Fla., and was expected to complete its report
on the incident next week, a Pentagon spokesman said.
   The results are not likely to be announced until mid-August at
the earliest, Pentagon officials said.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who heads the team, was to report
to the commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. George B.
Crist, at U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa.
   Crist, in turn, will give classified and unclassified versions
of the report to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William J. Crowe, who will pass them, with his comments, to Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci for a final review.
   ``I understand that Adm. Fogarty is prepared to report to Gen.
Crist next week,'' said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.
   ``The process involves review by Gen. Crist with his comments,
then Adm. Crowe, and the secretary of defense, and nothing ensues
until that review process is completed. We don't go public until
the process is completed. In short, don't expect anything next
week,'' Hoffman said.
   Pentagon officials have promised to release as soon as possible
an unclassified report on why the USS Vicennes shot down the Iran
Air A300 Airbus with 290 aboard on July 3.
   At the time, Navy officials said the officers on the Vincennes
mistook the airliner for an attacking F-14 fighter.
   The chief Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, told reporters
Thursday that officials were trying to avoid a repetition of the
delays experienced in releasing a report on the May 17, 1987,
attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi fighter.
   ``In the case of the Stark investigation, it was five months
before the report was actually released. We'd like to do a better
job of getting it to you earlier,'' Howard said.
   Howard said it was ``unlikely'' the report would be released
before Carlucci returns Aug. 8 from a trip to the Soviet Union and
Turkey.
   ``I don't have a timetable for release,'' said Howard.
   Fogarty, originally asked to complete his investigation by July
15, was granted an extension through the end of July.

<HEAD>Spurt In Consumer Spending Fuels Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending increased in June at the
fastest pace in 10 months, the government said Thursday, fueling
concern over inflation and whether the economy will have room for
production of exports.
   The Commerce Department said personal consumption spending,
which includes virtually everything except interest on debt, shot
up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the steepest climb
since a 1.3 percent gain in August, two months before the October
stock market crash.
   The report was a disappointment to many economists who are
looking for growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow
the nation's trade deficit.
   Excessive consumer demand implies that imports will grow and
that factories will have difficulty increasing production of
exports if they also have to step up manufacture of goods for
domestic buyers. This strain on factory capacity could add to
inflation if buyers bid up the price of scarce goods.
   In another economic report adding to inflation concerns, the
Labor Department said import prices, one of the main inflationary
threats facing the U.S. economy because of the weaker dollar, rose
2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest increase in more
than a year.
   The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March
period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first
three months of 1987, which was attributed almost entirely to
rising crude oil prices.
   Most analysts were expecting consumer demand to slow after the
October stock market crash, but that has not happened.
   ``There's some real danger here that we will end up with too
much of a good thing,'' warned David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   ``This consumer spending is so strong it probably will trigger,
at some point, Federal Reserve actions to push interest rates
higher,'' he said, adding that the move most likely will come after
Aug. 16 when Federal Reserve policymakers next meet to consider
monetary policy.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, appearing before
a House Banking subcommittee on Thursday, repeated a warning
delivered to the Senate two weeks ago that the Fed was likely to
err on the side of tightening the money supply, rather than
loosening.
   Greenspan said the 4.7-percent inflation figure released
Wednesday as part of the report on the second quarter gross
national product was ``somewhat larger than we would have
expected.''
   However, he said recent economic indicators have shown no
evidence that would cause the Federal Reserve to radically change
its policy.
   ``There have been a lot of data ... but none has altered either
my or, as far as I can judge, the board's general view as to where
we are going and where we have been ... In a certain sense, it has
been a period in which there have been fewer surprises than
normal,'' he said.
   The report on consumer spending also showed that Americans'
personal income jumped a healthy 0.7 percent to $4.04 trillion in
June, the best showing in three months. It followed a 0.5 percent
rise in May, a modest 0.2 percent increase in April and a 1.0
percent jump in March.
   The gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in
employment in June. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent
last month, a 14-year low.
   With spending rising a bit faster than income, Americans'
personal savings rate fell slightly to 4.3 percent, compared with
4.4 percent in May. Still, the average savings rate for the first
half of 1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in
1987.
   Americans' after-tax income increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8
percent in June after shooting up 2.4 percent in May. The
department said tax payments declined in both May and June after
higher-than-average payments in April.
   The department gave these details of spending:
   _On durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three
or more years, spending rose $8.6 billion in June compared with an
increase of $2.7 billion in May.
   _On non-durable goods, spending rose $4.5 billion in June,
compared with $4.6 billion the month before.
   _On services, spending rose $17.7 billion last month, compared
with $11.3 billion in May.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington
consulting firm, said the June increase in personal spending was
not as alarming as it might have been because it was likely
temporarily bolstered by heavy use of electrical power to run air
conditioners.
   ``The trend in consumer spending is about 2 percent (annual)
growth. Certainly it's not driving the economy,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fourteen Sinhalese Killed On Anniversary of Sri Lanka Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels stabbed and hacked to
death 14 Sinhalese farmers on Thursday, the military said. The
killings occurred on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at
ending the nation's civil war.
   The military accused a Tamil rebel group called the Liberation
Tigers for killing the cinnamon farmers near Padaviya village in
northeastern Sri Lanka.
   The slaughter occurred even though the military had placed
soldiers on a nationwide alert to prevent violence on the
anniversary. About 50,000 Indian troops also imposed a curfew in
some Tamil strongholds in northern Sri Lanka.
   Two farmers escaped with stab injuries and alerted a nearby Sri
Lankan army camp, said a military official who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   Sri Lankan troops who arrived at the scene found some of the
victims tied to trees, the officials said. All the victims were
males.
   A 24-hour curfew will be imposed beginning Friday morning in
southern Matara and Hambantota districts, state radio announced.
``Stern action will be taken against those violating peace,'' the
report said.
   Sinhalese extremists of the People's Liberation Front have
issued handbills and posters calling for two days of ``national
resistance'' to protest the accord. The front called on people to
stay indoors, stay home from their jobs and switch off the lights
in their homes at night.
   Posters by the Patriotic People's Organization, the front's
military wing, threatened to take unspecified action against people
who ignore its orders.
   Tamil rebel groups and the People's Liberation Front oppose the
peace accord signed by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
President Junius R. Jayewardene in Colombo one year ago. The accord
offers limited autonomy to Tamils living in northern and eastern
sections of the country.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
people and claim discrimination by the dominant Sinhalese
Buddhists, who control the government and armed forces. The civil
war has killed more than 6,000 people.
   India, an overwhelmingly Hindu nation, has a Tamil community
more than three times the size of Sri Lanka's entire 16 million
population.
   India has long tried to play the role of peacemaker in its
neighbor's civil war. The Indian troops landed with Sri Lanka's
permission in the rebel-dominated northern Jaffna Peninsula to
implement the accord.

<HEAD>Iraq Ask Security Council to Guarantee Peace Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq demanded a formal peace treaty wih
Iran, not just a cease-fire, and asked the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday to guarantee its enforcement.
   In New York, the Iranian U.N. Mission said: ``The policy of Iraq
is to put obstacles in the way of the secretary-general's peace
efforts. This whole Iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the
efforts upon which the international community is looking with
hope.''
   Both sides reported fighting at Eslamabad, 60 miles inside Iran.
Iraq, which says it has withdrawn from Iranian territory, describes
the invaders as Iranian rebels but Iran claims they are Iraqi
troops.
   Iraqi television said Saadun Hamadi, the acting foreign
minister, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent Security
Council members _ United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France _ and insisted on a peace treaty.
   ``This is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement'' of the
8-year-old war, he was quoted as saying.
   He added, however, that ``Iraq is for an early, immediate
cease-fire as a means to end the war within the framework of a
comprehensive peace settlement.''
   U.N. negotiations are being conducted under Security Council
Resolution 598, the year-old proposal Iran says it will accept. It
provides for a cease-fire followed by withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
of which side started the war.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, said in New
York that Iran responded positively to his proposals for
implementing the resolution and was awaiting Iraq's reaction.
   He has met with the foreign ministers of the two countries, Ali
Akbar Velayati and Tariq Aziz. Hamadi is Iraq's acting foreign
minister while Aziz is in New York.
   Perez de Cuellar also said he hopes Iran will consider ``at some
stage'' holding direct talks with Iraq, which insists on them. He
said talks at the United Nations were suspended for ``reflection''
Thursday.
   Iraqi television quoted Hamadi as telling the ambassadors:
``Lasting and comprehensive peace is the only way Iran will not
change its position in the future. The peace treaty should be
guaranteed by the Security Council member states.
   ``A cease-fire would not end the state of war and instability in
the region.''
   Hamadi also restated Iraq's position that it ``has no ambitions
in Iranian territory.''
   Iran said its forces broke through the defenses of Iraqi troops
and Iranian rebels at Eslamabad inside the central border, killing
at least 4,000 Iraqis and ``mercenaries,'' according to a dispatch
of the official Islamic Republic News Agency monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus.
   Spokesmen of the Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian rebel movement
based in Iraq, said units of its National Liberation Army were
holding Eslamabad.
   A communique from Iraq's military said its warplanes were
bombing Iranian military airfields in the area, indicating the
Iraqis at least were providing air support.
   The rebels claim to have occupied Eslamabad and nearby Karand,
but Iran says the invasion has been led by regular Iraqi troops.
   An Iraqi communique read on television reported continuing
fighting on the border front, despite the claims that Iraq's
soldiers had withdrawn from Iranian territory occupied over the
past week.
   It said said warplanes flew 173 sorties and attacked helicopter
landing strips east of Eslamabad. The comminique also said the jets
destroyed an Iranian helicopter base in Bakhtaran, 30 miles from
Eslamabad.
   Tehran said Iranian fighter bombers and helicopters flew 175
sorties over the central and southern fronts.
   Dispatches from the official news agency said Iranian forces had
regained more than 150 square miles in the central sector and two
northern peaks.
   Iranian television, also monitored in Nicosia, showed what it
said were Iranian soldiers entering Eslamabad. Dispatches from the
news agency said the bodies of many Iranian rebels were found,
including young women.
   IRNA said the ``terrorists, known as the Munafiqeen
(hypocrites), were also equipped with anti-chemical masks, first
aid kits, Iraqi cigarettes and alcoholic drinks brewed in Iraq.''
Islam forbids the drinking of alcohol.
   ``Among other things found in the pockets of slain ... women
terrorists were contraceptive pills, which show the widespread
promiscuity in the ranks of both the Munafiqeen and the Iraqis,''
it said.

   Police who shot and wounded an escapee
recognized him as the man they shot and wounded five years ago in
the arrest that sent him to prison.
   Both shootings came at the end of wild chases that resulted in
wrecks after the man fled across the same bridge.
   Before the latest incident, Robert E. Reichman, 37, was
handcuffed to other inmates in a van taking them to court
appearances Wednesday at the Escambia County Judicial Center in
Pensacola.
   Reichman apparently used a paper clip to unlock his handcuffs
and then fled. Officer Bill Ogle fired two shots at the escapee but
missed, said Capt. Bob McFann of the Escambia County Department of
Corrections.
   While Ogle guarded the other inmates, security officers gave
chase on foot.
   The escapee fled through an alley and pulled courthouse employee
Carol Smiley from her parked car.
   ``Ma'am, I got to use your car, I got to use your car,'' Ms.
Smiley said the man told her.
   Reichman then drove across a three-mile-long bridge over
Pensacola Bay and into Gulf Breeze, authorities said. Gulf Breeze
police joined the chase.
   A tire was blown out when the car hit a curb and the vehicle
then skidded into a guide wire on a utility pole, said Gulf Breeze
Police Chief Jerry Brown.
   He said Detective Robert Barnwell fired three shots when
Reichman jumped from the car. Two of the bullets struck him.
   Reichman was in stable condition Thursday at University Hospital
in Pensacola. He was admitted with gunshot wounds in the left leg
and buttock.
   In November 1983, Gulf Breeze Officer Curtis McFee, who now
works elsewhere, tried to stop Reichman for a traffic violation.
   Reichman fled across the same bridge but in the opposite
direction and wrecked his car. He exchanged gunfire with McFee, who
wounded Reichman in the eye and leg.
   Reichman was then convicted of bank robbery, attempted
second-degree murder of a police officer and other crimes.
   He was being taken to court Wednesday for resentencing after an
appeals court overturned his original 25-year term on technical
grounds.
   Reichman now faces additional charges of escape, grand theft of
an automobile, fleeing police officers and resisting arrest.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski met
Thursday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and said both
sides are determined to work toward further improvements in
Polish-American relations.
   Olechowski, the first Polish foreign minister to visit
Washington in nine years, said he invited Shultz to visit Poland.
The response was one of ``general approval,'' he said but no
details were discussed.
   Polish-American relations hit bottom after Poland imposed
martial law in 1981 and outlawed the independent trade union
Solidarity. The reconciliation process began about two years ago,
highlighted by a visit to Warsaw last October by Vice President
George Bush and the lifting by last year of the economic sanctions
that had been imposed by the United States.
   ``We have normalized our relations,'' Olechowski told reporters
after a two-hour meeting with Shultz and other senior officials
from both sides.
   Although progress in bilateral relations has been made, ``we
certainly hope it's not the end of the road,'' Olechowski said.
   He said the ``ambitions, the interests and the intentions'' of
both countries are extensive and there is ``a determination on both
ends to go ahead.''
   There is room for increased political contacts and economic and
cultural cooperation, he said. ``In all areas, there are
possibilities.''
   One source of friction between the two countries is Poland's
claim that the United States has been providing financial support
to Solidarity.
   Polish authorities also believe that the West has been too slow
in extending credits that would enable Poland to overcome its
economic problems, which include a $40 billion foreign debt, the
largest in Eastern Europe.
   Olechowski's visit was his first trip outside Poland since he
became foreign minister several weeks ago. It occurred a day after
Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz met with President
Reagan during an official visit.
   Grosz's visit also was seen as a breakthrough because no
Hungarian leader of that rank had visited Washington since Hungary
became communist 40 years ago.
   Both Hungary and Poland are members of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. Asked why he was visiting Washington instead of Moscow on his
first foreign trip, Olechowski said the visit had been planned by
his predecessor, Marian Orzechowski.

<HEAD>Import Prices Surge 2.7 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>

   The price of imported goods, one of the main
inflationary yardsticks in the U.S. economy, rose 2.7 percent in
the April-June quarter, the largest increase in more than a year,
the government reported Thursday.
   The Labor Department said the second quarter rise followed a 1.2
percent increase in the January-March period and was the steepest
since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months of 1987, which
was attributed almost entirely to rising crude oil prices.
   Higher oil prices were also a significant contributor to the
second quarter gain this year. Imported fuel and related products
jumped 6.7 percent from the first quarter. However, over the past
year, they were down 12.7 percent.
   Excluding the effects of the jump in imported oil, second
quarter prices rose 2.3 percent, in line with the average quarterly
increase over the last three years.
   Sharp rises in metals and natural rubber led the climb. Iron and
steel prices soared 35 percent in the second quarter, while other
metals rose 16.5 percent. The price of imported nickel, a key
ingredient in steel manufacturing, shot up 55.8 percent for the
quarter and more than doubled in price over the past year.
   The price of natural rubber climbed 32.8 percent for the quarter
and was up 60 percent from a year ago. Bill Alterman, a Labor
Department analyst, said the worldwide acquired immune deficiency
syndrome epidemic is driving up natural rubber prices by increasing
the demand for condoms and rubber gloves.
   For the past year, import prices were up 6.3 percent. That
compares with a 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation in overall
consumer prices since the beginning of 1987.
   The fall of the dollar from highs in early 1985, while improving
the price competitiveness of U.S. goods overseas and helping to
lower the U.S. trade deficit, also has the effect of boosting the
price of foreign goods in American markets.
   However, according to the report, the dollar played a
substantially smaller role in driving up import prices than in
previous quarters. The dollar declined in value against foreign
currencies by only 0.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with
drops of 1.1 percent in the first quarter and 5.8 percent in last
three months of 1987.
   In recent weeks, the value of the dollar has been rising.
   On the export side, prices of U.S. goods sold overseas also rose
2.7 percent, the largest increase since the government began
tracking the figures in September 1983.
   Rising metal costs, as well as the first drought-caused jumps in
grain prices, were responsible for much of the export rise in the
second quarter.
   The price of exported grain was up 9.3 percent in the April-June
period, led by a 30.1 percent hike in wheat prices. Iron and steel
prices rose 4.4 percent while other metals were up 7.2 percent.

<HEAD>Atlanta Teen-agers Back After Two Weeks In Soviet Georgia</HEAD>

   Teen-agers who spent two weeks with Soviet
Georgia families said they are happy they went, but glad to get
home to food they can identify and parents who let them go places
on their own.
   ``I enjoyed visiting and they're ready to have me and my whole
family back, but I don't know if I'd want to live there,'' said
Susan Sugarman, 17. ``I guess because it's so different and I'm
used to everything here.''
   She and nine other high school students returned Tuesday from a
visit with families in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia and
the official sister city of the U.S. Georgia's capital. The
privately arranged visit cost $1,400.
   Ten Soviet teen-agers arrive Aug. 12 for a two-week stay with
their counterparts' families.
   Miss Sugarman, who stayed with the vice chairman of the
Communist Party in Soviet Georgia, said her hosts were almost too
generous.
   ``If I liked something it was instantly mine,'' she said. ``They
would buy me everything. If I spent more than 10 seconds looking at
something, it was mine _ necklaces, rings, bracelets. My Soviet mom
gave me all this money. She gave me tons and tons of big coffee
table books about the state of Georgia.
   ``My Georgian grandmother came downstairs one day _ she didn't
speak any English _ and gave me a ring off her finger,'' she said.
``I'm sure it's a family heirloom. I'm totally scared I'm going to
lose it.
   Heather Sharp, 17, said the only money she spent was on a
chocolate ice cream cone in Moscow.
   ``It was the only thing I put in my mouth that I knew what it
would taste like,'' she said. ``I think I ate stuffed eggplant
every single night. It wasn't very good. I can't tell you what the
food was because it was completely different.''
   Miss Sharp said she got along well with her 13-year-old host,
Maia Tsintsadze.
   ``It was this little girl's dream to come to America and she
treated me with a lot of respect,'' she said.
   Miss Sharp said she wasn't impressed with the clothing styles in
the Soviet Union, but neither was her host.
   ``Their clothes were kind of old fashioned,'' she said. ``Not
hoop skirts, not that old. It wasn't trendy like our clothes. We'd
go shopping and she'd say, `You don't want to go to our clothes
stores. They're ugly. Even we don't like them.'''
   Steven Bird, 16, said he cherished the few opportunities he had
to meet people on his own.
   ``Although Russia is supposed to be a classless society, Georgia
has a very strict class system and our hosts were the creme de la
creme of Georgian society,'' he said. ``We didn't get to mix much
with the lower classes.''
   On one visit to a nearby small town, Bird said, ``people in the
street starting gravitating toward us, so we started giving out our
cards and some trinkets and sticks of gum.''
   ``I felt great that the people from this place who were
supposedly our enemies were so loving and kind to us,'' he said.
``They followed us around. The kids were shy, but they were giving
me these things out of the blue because I was there and I was
American.''

<HEAD>Canadian Jet Reports Climbing Sharply To Avoid Soviet Military
Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian jetliner with 246 passengers aboard
had to climb sharply to avoid colliding with Soviet military planes
that were intercepted by U.S. and Canadian fighters over the
Atlantic, officials said Thursday.
   ``It was a fairly close call,'' said Transport Canada spokesman
Norm Pascoe.
   The incident happened Wednesday at 12:40 p.m. EDT about 250
miles off the coast of Newfoundland and involved a Worldways Canada
DC-8 airliner, said Worldways Vice President Bill Doucette. He said
the passenger jet was flying from London's Gatwick Airport to
Ottawa and Toronto.
   Doucette said the pilot reported seeing two Soviet planes and
two fighters within 500 to 1,000 feet of his flight path.
   He ``pulled up and pulled right'' to avoid collision, Doucette
said. No one was hurt and the plane landed safely at Ottawa.
   The DC-8 was cruising at 31,000 feet and had no warning of
military traffic in the area, Doucette said.
   Capt. Don Roy of Canada's National Defense Department said two
U.S. F-15 fighters based in Maine and two Canadian CF-18 fighters
from Quebec had been sent to intercept two Soviet Bear-H
reconnaissance aircraft in what he termed a ``normal intercept.''
   The Soviet planes were in international airspace, but Roy said
U.S. and Canadian jets intercept Soviet aircraft that close to the
coast ``to let them know we know they're there.'' It was the 16th
intercept this year.
   He said it was up to civilian air traffic control to inform the
DC-8 of any military traffic in the area.
   The Canadian Aviation Safety Board was expected to investigate
why there was an apparent breakdown in communications.

<HEAD>Witness Says Hamadi Brother Bragged Mohammed Was Involved in
Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness testified Thursday that
Mohammed Ali Hamadi's older brother bragged in a West German bar
shortly after a 1985 TWA hijacking that Mohammed was involved in
seizing the jetliner.
   Another acquaintance of Mohammed Hamadi testified that the
defendant was ``crazy about Khomeini'' (Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch), and a third said Hamadi
admitted belonging to Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian radical Shiite
Moslem group linked to kidnappings in Lebanon.
   Mohammed Hamadi is accused of being one of the hijackers of TWA
flight 847, which was seized on June 14, 1985 and diverted to
Beirut, Lebanon. The gunmen killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
and held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days.
   A West German court convicted Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, in
April of kidnapping two West Germans in Beirut in an attempt to
force West Germany to free Mohammed.
   Gaazi Yazbeck, a Lebanese man who lives in West Germany and
knows the two Hamadis, was asked in court if Mohammed Hamadi ever
mentioned the hijacking to him.
   ``No, Mohammed said nothing. But his brother, Abbas, said
Mohammed had something to do with the hijacking,'' Yazbeck replied.
``He just said it, he was sort of bragging.''
   Yazbeck said the conversation occurred ``a few weeks after the
airplane was hijacked'' at a bar in Saarland state, where Abbas
Hamadi was then living.
   Another witness, Elfriede Akcura, said she befriended Mohammed
Hamadi while he lived in West Germany from 1982-1984 and they
frequently discussed religion.
   ``He was crazy about Khomeini,'' she said. ``He is a Khomeini
follower.''
   Witness Reinhard Schmid, who shared a cell with Hamadi for six
months in 1987, said that at one point Hamadi admitted to being a
member of Hezbollah.
   Schmid, who was in prison for a drug offense but is now free,
said he asked Hamadi what Hezbollah's goals were and quoted Hamadi
as replying, ``The goal of the Hezbollah is to wipe out the
Zionists even if it takes generations.''
   He said Hamadi told him Hezbollah's enemies were Israel,
``France and those supported by the Americans.''
   Schmid told the court that during their conversations Hamadi
insisted he had nothing to do with the hijacking.
   But he said Hamadi also told him ``he was willing to confess to
anything if his boss in Lebanon told him to, including that he was
in the airplane and shot at Stethem, regardless of the
consequences.''
   Schmid said that after former hostages viewed Hamadi in a lineup
and said they recognized him, Hamadi told him: ``I don't know how
they can recognize me, because I had nothing to do with it.''
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,
1987, after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his
luggage.
   Two West Germans, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt, were
kidnapped shortly after in Beirut.
   Abbas Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport after returning
from Lebanon on Jan. 26, 1987, and was charged with the abductions.
   The kidnappers freed Schmidt in September. Cordes remains a
hostage.

   Michael G. Gartner, the new president of NBC
News, might have caused some palpitations among his subordinates
Thursday when he talked about his standards.
   ``My favorite network is the BBC,'' Gartner said in a
closed-circuit broadcast to NBC employees and affiliates, ``and I
think if we just had somebody standing there reading the news, and
could get rid of all this film and everything, it would be far more
palatable.''
   Just kidding, he added, indicating that he had no plans to
drastically change the look of NBC's ``Nightly News.''
   ``I happen to think that in Tom Brokaw and in all the producers
here, we have the greatest news organization in the world. So the
answer is, I like NBC,'' Gartner said.
   Gartner, 49, was appointed Wednesday to replace Lawrence K.
Grossman, who stepped down after four years as head of the news
division. Gartner, a former editor of the Des Moines (Iowa)
Register and The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., was most
recently editor and part-owner of the Ames (Iowa) Daily Tribune and
a general executive of Gannett Co. Inc.

   Elderly small-town Mississippi blues
singers are being tapped as historians by a new National Public
Radio series in which they share their memories and music to help
young blacks understand their rural roots.
   ``Blues is not entertainment only,'' said Walter Liniger, whose
10 interviews with local blues lovers are woven together in the
oral history and music series, ``The Original Down Home Blues
Show.''
   ``Blues players have often been compared to the `griot' in the
African tribal system. The `griot' was the storyteller, singer and
historian of the tribe,'' Liniger said.
   ``In a sense the blues player once had a similar function:
He-she processed and voiced in his-her own way the emotional
undertows of the black community,'' said Liniger of the Blues
Archive at the University of Mississippi.
   Syndicated by National Public Radio in January, the program
already has aired on 12 stations around the country, said Craig
Koon, president of Media Productions International, which covered
the project's $23,000 and provided technical assistance.
   Thirty-four other stations are scheduled to begin broadcasting
the series soon, Koon said. His company, based in Memphis, Tenn.,
is negotiating with an underwriter to fund additional interviews
with aging blues men and women.
   Liniger, a Swiss-born musician, said he didn't interview any
well-known musicians. He was interested in the everyday men and
women, ages 60 to 80, from the rural South.
   ``If you go back to the early part of this century where the
idiom of blues begins to sort of take shape, then the (blues)
records or people's memories are the only thing we have to document
a certain aspect of the black experience in this country,'' Liniger
said.
   ``I do believe that even if we read black intellectuals of the
time, they were concerned with other topics than the rural South.
They were much more concerned with the black experience in urban
settings.
   ``The feeling I got from talking with a lot of older black
people is they are living in a social context that is not
documented either by blacks or whites.''
   Each program in the series features an interview with a single
musician.
   The musicians don't always perform, but sometimes choose from
the Archive's selection songs that they enjoyed in younger years.
Liniger then talks with them about what life was like when that
song was popular _ exploring the educational, social, religious and
moral aspects of the day.
   For example, 70-year-old Ellen Jefferies of Holly Springs
describes in one program her grade school memories.
   ``I went to the `rag school,' to the `bush hollow' ... just some
posts nailed in the ground with some limbs and things cut off of
trees and piled up around `em and also over the top of it the same
way. And that's what we went to school in _ the bush hollow. We
toted our water from the spring down at the bottom of the hill,''
she says.
   About 10 children would gather at the bush hollow for class _
unless they were needed in the fields or elsewhere to help the
family get by, Jefferies said.
   Many rural black women of her day didn't have the luxury of a
doctor's or hospital's care when their children were born, she said.
   ``I never went to no hospital. I had my children myself,''
Jefferies recalls. ``I had a midwife to come see me once or twice.
But whenever they'd get there my childrens was born. I ain't lying.
I had my childrens my own self. Me and the good Lord together, I
say it like that.''
   Five of her seven children died, Jefferies said.
   Jefferies said she's particularly proud of her son who lives in
Chicago _ a much different world than her Holly Springs.
   Liniger said he hopes the radio program's use of blues tunes as
historical benchmarkers will help the children of Chicago and other
urban areas better understand the lives of their grandparents.
   In another interview, Liniger asked 76-year-old Lee Andrew
``Cotton'' Howell of Holly Springs: ``What does the blues offer you
today?''
   Howell replied: ``It helps me along. It brings up stories and
memories with my friends. We'd be sittin' and talkin', you know.
Ain't that many left.''

<HEAD>Senators Offer Plan to Combat Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen senators, including the Energy
Committee chairman, unveiled a comprehensive plan Thursday to
combat the global overheating that scientists say threatens the
planet in the 21st Century.
   Their legislation, with proposals ranging from developing safer
nuclear power to minimizing destruction of Third World forests,
represents the broadest Capitol Hill response yet to warnings from
scientists about the so-called greenhouse effect.
   ``The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic,
political, environmental and human problem facing the 21st
Century,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., the principal author of
package.
   Joining him at a news conference was Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
the energy chairman who has over the years been identified more
with energy development and production than with environmental
protection.
   Johnston, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect,
said that ``the evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable.
It is so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing than
anything we've ever seen.''
   Aides said that Johnston has become convinced that global action
is necessary to combat the production of carbon and other
greenhouse gases that scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere,
threatening major changes in climate and higher ocean levels.
   Johnston, who said he would hold more hearings in coming weeks,
stopped short of endorsing a key element of Wirth's proposal:
requiring new car fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, or
double the 1985 fuel efficiency standard.
   The legislation would force this country to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate that
carbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, produces
about half the greenhouse effect. The United States is said to be
responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.
   The proposal would require administration officials to draft a
national energy plan emphasizing least-cost ways of reducing fossil
fuel use and increasing use of renewables such as solar energy.
   The package would authorize about $1 billion through 1992 for
research and development of non-fossil energy sources and a new
generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls for
greater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating and
transportation.
   On the international front, the secretary of state would be
urged to hold an international meeting aimed at getting other
nations to commit to a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production
by 2015.
   The legislation would authorize this country to spend more than
$1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control
information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in
burgeoning nations.
   It also calls for the United States to work through
international lending and development agencies to slow the
destruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive but
which emit huge amounts when they are cut down.
   Johnston said that to slow pollution in the Third World, ``we're
going to have to pay for their non-development in some way, and
it's going to be expensive.''
   He said that in 1989, ``we'll have to begin the serious process
of legislating. We'll act as fast as the public's willing to
support us.''
   Johnston said that economic interests like automakers and coal
producers ``must understand that this is not a passing fad, that
it's not going to go away. This will not change with
administrations. It's not a Democratic-Republican issue. It's not a
liberal-conservative issue. And I'm not sure we can solve it.''
   Joining as cosponsors were Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; John Danforth,
R-Mo.; Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; John Heinz,
R-Pa.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; John Melcher, D-Mont.; Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; and
Robert Stafford, R-Vt.
   The package was introduced a day after Stafford, Baucus, Chaffee
and David Durenberger, R-Minn., submitted legislation to end all
U.S. production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999. These
chemicals contribute to global warming as well as destroying the
ozone layer that shields the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays.
   Their bill would also force power plants to reduce emissions of
the pollutants that cause acid rain and require new homes to
contain the most efficient heating and cooling systems available.

   The Disabled American Veterans on Thursday elected
a Texan who was wounded in combat in World War II to a one-year
term as the organization's national commander.
   Billy E. Kirby of Clifton, who was DAV vice commander for the
last two years, was elected as the group closed its 67th annual
national convention.
   Kirby, in his acceptance speech, criticized ``the sorry state''
of several Veterans Administration programs and pledged to fight
for change.
   He said VA cuts have created problems in the agency's processing
of veterans' claims for benefits. Kirby also charged that VA budget
and staffing cuts left thousands without medical treatment.
   Kirby began active duty in the U.S. Army in 1940. He sustained
gunshot wounds to his right shoulder and arm on Jan. 21, 1944,
during the Rapido River Battle in Italy.
   Convention delegates adopted 172 resolutions, nearly all of
which call for improvements in benefits provided by the VA and
other federal agencies.
   Delegates urged elevating the VA to a Cabinet-level department.
Legislation to give the VA a Cabinet seat received President
Reagan's endorsement in November and was under consideration by
Congress.

   The House passed 368-29 on Thursday a $5.8
billion relief package for drought-stricken farmers after scaling
back a heavily debated price-support increase for the dairy
industry.
   ``Hold on,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de
la Garza, D-Texas, declared as the House approved the measure.
``Help is coming in a sensible, rational, compassionate way.''
   Approval came after dairy-state lawmakers responded to a
drumroll of criticism by compromising on a plan to increase the
price-support level for milk. The House adopted 217-181 a
scaled-back version that still would leave the cost of the benefit
above the $100 million level.
   ``This offers stability for our dairy farmers,'' Rep. Steve
Gunderson, R-Wis., declared as the House approved his plan to
impose a 50-cent increase in the milk price-support level, but only
for three months.
   The action resolved the most heavily debated issue in the House
version of the drought aid package. The Senate was expected to rush
the measure through with equal dispatch, possibly before the night
was out.
   Both House and Senate were working on highly similar versions of
the bill with an eye toward putting the bill before the president
at least by Aug. 11, when lawmakers are set to flee Washington's
summer heat.
   ``This bill is the most generous disaster relief package ever
considered by the Senate,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
J. Leahy, D-Vt., said as debate began in that chamber.
   At the core of both bills is a provision that would pay
drought-stricken farmers 65 percent of lost earnings from crop
damage in excess of 35 percent of the harvest expected before
blazing sun and a shortage of rainfall hammered the Midwest.
   Key provisions also would streamline and expand government
programs to aid livestock and dairy producers forced to pay
escalating feed costs because the drought has burned away a
substantial quantity of hay and feedgrains.
   Gunderson and Penny offered their plan to scale back the dairy
provision after the original version came under criticism from the
Reagan administration as excessively costly.
   Sponsored by Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., the original version
would have imposed an increase in the dairy price support level of
50 cents on Oct. 1 to $11.10 for each 100 pounds of milk. That
would cost consumers, at most, a few cents per gallon in increased
milk prices.
   Dairy-state lawmakers said the cost to the government would be
$145 million, while Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said in a
letter to the House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de
la Garza, D-Texas, on Wednesday night that the actual cost would be
$300 million.
   Lawmakers said that the Gunderson-Penny plan, limiting the
increase to a three-month period from April through June next year,
would reduce costs by perhaps $30 million.
   Dairy-state lawmakers have been saying that the increase is
warranted to avert a milk shortage looming over the country next
spring and because milk producers have faced greater feed costs
while not receiving the disaster payments that the bill allocates
for crop producers.
   But the increase has come under fire not only from the Reagan
administration but from an array of business groups and even farm
organizations that most often ally themselves with dairymen in
matters involving farm-subsidy legislation.
   ``This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., told the House in urging it to slash any
price-support increase from the legislation. ``Should those in the
cattle business, in the sheep and the poultry business, be asked to
pay the same high feed costs without some similar subsidy _ that's
not fair.''
   Before taking up the dairy issue, the House approved an
amendment sponsored by de la Garza that would bring the estimate
cost to $5.8 billion. When the measure came to the floor, the price
tag was placed at $6.9 billion by the Agriculture Committee staff.
   The reason was because of a provision that would have required
the Agriculture Department to pay half of the cost of reseeding and
other seeding of drought-burned pastures in 20 states. The measure
sponsored by Rep. Claude Harris, D-Ala., was harnessed to the bill
when the Agriculture Committee was racing to wrap up work and later
estimated to have a $1.2 billion cost.
   De la Garza's amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by
shrinking the seeding provision.
   Even then, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, acknowledged
Thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of
exactly how much the drought bill would cost. Farm lawmakers have
been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level
have nothing to complain about because it would be less than
federal savings realized because of the drought.
   But Wright said there was no certainty.
   ``The art of economics is not a precise one,'' Wright said.

   Top Soviet and American officials will meet in
Geneva starting Sunday to exchange views on the prospects for a
negotiated withdrawal of all foreign forces from southwestern
Africa, the State Department said Thursday.
   Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker
will lead the U.S. delegation and Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly
Adamyshin will head the Soviet side.
   The two days of talks will take place on the eve of a new round
of negotiations aimed at achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces
from Angola and Namibian independence from South Africa.
   The negotiations, also set for Geneva, involve Cuba, Angola and
South Africa with the United States playing a mediating role. The
talks will be held from Aug. 2-4 with Crocker representing the
United States.
   He has spent seven years attempting to arrange a settlement but,
with five armies involved in the conflict and the negotiations
plagued by mutual distrust among the participants, the task has not
been easy.
   During the last round of talks, Cuba, Angola and South Africa
reached agreement on a statement of principles governing future
negotiations.
   The next round is expected to include discussions on a timetable
for the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban forces from
Angola, where South Africa also has several thousand troops
deployed in support of a U.S.-backed rebel group.
   The Soviets also play a key role in the conflict because of
their extensive military support for Angola's Marxist government.
In the talks starting Sunday, Crocker is expected ask Adamyshin
about Soviet willingness to encourage a final settlement. In
discussions over the past year, the Soviets have indicated a
positive attitude toward the negotiations and Cuba has been sending
out similar signals.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman also said Crocker and
Adamyshin also will discuss the situation in the Horn of Africa,
where there has been continued civil strife in Ethiopia, the Sudan
and Somalia.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said the Soviet-backed
government in Ethiopia has been supporting insurgents in both the
Sudan and Somalia.

<HEAD>New Recycling Law Signed In Pennsylvania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law signed Thursday requires most
residents to separate their trash within three years, making
Pennsylvania the largest state with a mandatory recycling program.
   In a brief ceremony in the rose garden at the Executive Mansion,
Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the trash bill before a handful of
lawmakers and several representatives of groups who had worked for
the bill's passage.
   The law mandates that 407 communities with 7.8 million people
establish the recycling plans to help cope with a growing trash
problem and dwindling landfill space.
   ``All over our state and all over our nation it's as plain as
the eye can see or the nose can smell that we have to change our
ways,'' Casey said.
   The state's remaining 77 landfills have a combined capacity of
only three to five years, he said. Pennsylvanians each year
generate nine million tons of trash, 95 percent of which goes into
landfills, Casey said. Only 1 percent of the state's trash is
recycled.
   ``Whether it floats up on beaches or seeps out of landfills, we
can see that our garbage does not disappear,'' Casey said.
   The governor said the recycling program would reduce the state's
volume of solid waste by 25 percent by 1997.
   Under the law, municipalities with more than 10,000 residents
must set up curbside recycling programs within two years and those
with 5,000 or more face a three-year deadline.
   Counties will choose three of eight materials to recycle
including glass, colored glass, aluminum, steel and bimetallic
cans, high-grade office paper, newsprint, corrugated paper and
plastics. All communities must recycle leaf waste.

   The most comprehensive banking bill since the
Great Depression cleared a House committee Thursday after 16{
grueling hours of debate, but it faces an uncertain future with
little time left in Congress' legislative year.
   The bill, approved by the House Banking Committee on a 30-20
vote, grants banks broad new securities powers but restricts their
ability to enter real estate and insurance and imposes new
obligations on them to serve the poor.
   The bill now is headed for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, where the chairman, Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., is
known to be skeptical of letting banks into the securities business.
   Depending on how long House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, allows
for Dingell's review, the powerful Michigan Democrat could kill the
bill through delay or exact concessions by threatening delay.
   Congress is preparing to leave town for its summer recess on
Aug. 12 and won't be back until Sept. 6. Then, it plans only a
month-long session before adjourning for the fall election campaign.
   ``There's a real question whether this bill is going to pass the
House. It's a very controversial bill and there just isn't much
time,'' said Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American
Bankers Association, the industry's largest trade group.
   Aides to Dingell, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Wright has not yet decided on a deadline for the Energy and
Commerce Committee, but they indicated that Dingell is not inclined
to act quickly.
   The Banking Committee, after a session that began 10 a.m.
Wednesday and ended 2:30 a.m. Thursday with only short breaks,
approved the measure with all but three Democrats in favor and all
but three Republicans opposed.
   The hodgepodge of compromises struck to get it through has
created some odd political coalitions. The banking industry and the
securities industry, normally bitter opponents, are both opposing
it for different reasons. Consumer groups are supporting it, along
with the real estate and insurance industries.
   But, the alignment could change _ with banks on one side and all
of the other groups on the other _ if Dingell, as expected,
tightens the restrictions on how banks are permitted to exercise
the new securities activities.
   ``The likelihood of the bill being improved by the Energy and
Commerce Committee is very small,'' Yingling said.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., whose Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on finance gets first crack at the securities
provisions, said Thursday his panel needed to make ``major
changes'' in the bill.
   ``There simply are not adequate safeguards for the banking
system,'' he said.
   The bill would, if enacted, represent the first crack in the
barrier between investment and commercial banking that was erected
as part of the reforms stemming from the 1929 stock market crash.
It allows bank holding companies to underwrite virtually every type
of security except corporate stock.
   The securities industry had unsuccessfully sought to keep
underwriting of corporate bonds, mutual funds and corporate debt
convertible to stock away from banks.
   But, the House bill includes those powers as well as the
underwriting of commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and
securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debt such as auto
loans.
   Other sections require banks:
   _To serve poor people by providing low-cost ``lifeline''
checking services for accounts between $25 and $1,000.
   _To offer special accounts for the cashing of government checks
such as Social Security and welfare checks, with a cashing charge
of no more than $2.
   _To have a good record of serving poor communities in their
lending area before getting permission from the Federal Reserve
Board to exercise new powers.
   _To cease further expansion into the real estate business for
two years.
   _To stay out of insurance underwriting and to limit the number
of additional institutions that can sell insurance underwritten by
other companies.
   The chairman of the banking committee, Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I., in a statement Thursday, hailed the bill as ``a
major step forward in providing a sane restructuring of the
financial industry and establishing a solid framework of
protections for consumers.''
   Republican opposition to the consumer sections had threatened
committee passage of the bill until an hour-long negotiating
session behind closed doors after midnight.
   Democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer
provisions and, in exchange, three Republicans _ Steve Bartlett of
Texas, John Hiler of Indiana and Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania _
voted in favor of the bill.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the
committee, had argued that the consumer provisions would, in
effect, give the federal government the power to allocate credit.
Also, because of their expense, they could impair the soundness of
the banking system, he said.

   Cher and her boyfriend angrily denied
Thursday that he tried to run down a photographer with her sports
car, blaming the resulting crash on frustration with being
constantly dogged by the media.
   Robert Camilletti, live-in boyfriend of the
singer-turned-actress, told reporters he lost control of the car
while swerving into the driveway of Cher's home in hopes of ducking
photographers camped outside.
   ``I never had any intention of ever hurting anyone at any
time,'' he said.
   The wreck outside Cher's Benedict Canyon home Wednesday heavily
damaged Cher's Ferrari and the photographer's car, but no one was
injured. Camilletti was arrested and booked for investigation of
felony assualt with a deadly weapon on free-lance photographer
Peter Brandt, 35. No charges have been filed.
   ``He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of
speed,'' Brandt said after the incident. ``I was within my rights.
I would never do anything illegal.''
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti, 24, have been companions since meeting
at a New York nightclub on her 40th birthday. A former New York
bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, Camilletti is pursuing an
acting career and recently completed shooting of ``Loverboy'' with
Kate Jackson and Kirstie Alley.
   At a news conference closed to most free-lance photographers and
representatives of the tabloid press, the couple discussed a litany
of grievances stemming from the spotlight on their relationship.
Cher, known for her revealing costumes, wore black pants, tunic and
jacket.
   Cher directed most of her anger at the tabloid press, but said
inaccurate stories about her had also been carried by the media in
general.
   ``I know that I have to give up lots of my rights, that people
can write in a magazine that I, you know, don't have my rib cage,
or that this is not my chin, or these are not my cheeks,'' she said.
   Since Cher won an Academy Award for her role in the movie
``Moonstruck,'' various publications have reported that the couple
is due to marry, that she is pregnant, which she denied, and that
she has undergone drastic plastic surgery to maintain her willowy
figure and high cheek bones, she said.
   ``I've been doing this for 25 years, and so I'm pretty much used
to having my private life destroyed and lies told about me,'' said
Cher, who began her public career in the 1960s as half of the
husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher.
   ``It's something that you pretty much have to get used to. After
a while it really bothers you and disrupts your family life. ...
I'm usually pretty good about it. I'm getting really, really
angry,'' she said.
   Cher said she didn't believe her boyfriend was capable of
intentionally hurting anyone.
   ``I know Robert. He is not a violent man. This is not Sean Penn
and Madonna,'' Cher said, referring to the pugnacious actor who's
had a number of well-publicized run-ins with photographers. She
hastened to add that Penn is ``the sweetest boy I've ever known''
and that his outbursts were also triggered by intense media
scrutiny.
   The couple refused to talk about possible legal action against
the photographer, whom they claimed was harassing them, and they
left the news conference without addressing media reports that
marriage was imminent.
   In a statement prepared by the couple's lawyer, Camilletti
called the crash the culmination of weeks of frustration.
   When Brandt and another photographer stepped into the road to
photograph Camilletti, he said he swerved toward the driveway, the
brakes of the Ferrari locked and the car slid into Brandt's Honda.
   Camilletti acknowledged that he smashed Brandt's camera in
frustration after the two photographers fled. Camiletti was
released on $2,000 bond.

   For professional whistler Joel Brandon it's not a
matter of putting his lips together and blowing.
   He inhales.
   ``I also sort of pop the notes off with my tongue a lot of the
time to get a more staccato effect than most whistlers use,''
Brandon said Wednesday. ``That's especially good for the Bach and
Handel pieces I like to do with symphony orchestras and in some
jazz improvisation.''
   Brandon, 40, won the 10th International Whistle-Off contest in
Carson City, Nev., earlier this year and won the championship of
the National Whistlers' Convention in Louisburg, N.C., for a second
year in a row.
   Brandon says he learned his unusual inhalation technique by
accident while walking on the street in Chicago when he was 7 or 8
years old.
   ``I was whistling, and I inhaled and made a sound I'd never made
before,'' he said.
   The technique has taken him to performances with several
symphony orchestras, night club engagements and an appearance on
Johnny Carson's television show.

   Jerry and Susan Beebe never pictured
themselves as detectives, but a mud-covered photo album helped them
solve a mystery.
   Beebe recently found the photo album and its pictures strewn
over a highway near the Platte River.
   He wanted to return the album to its owner, but there was no
name or address in the album and most of the photos had only first
names. The Beebes didn't recognize any of the locations.
   They spread the 200 or so photos on their living room floor to
dry, arranged them in chronological order and began looking for
clues.
   One photo, marked ``Grandma Van Wagenen,'' showed an elderly
woman standing in a backyard, overlooking a farm. A photo of a
college graduation was the only one marked with a place _ a photo
studio in Rome, N.Y.
   Beebe, 50, called directory assistance asked for a Van Wagenen
in Rome. The first Van Wagenen he called couldn't help, but gave
Beebe the numbers of some others.
   Harold Van Wagenen told Beebe he thought the album might belong
to a relative, Master Sgt. David Mathis, who is stationed at
Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.
   Beebe called Mathis' mother, Lois, in West Leyden, N.Y., who
provided the big break.
   ``Oh, that's Suzie's,'' said Mrs. Mathis.
   ``Suzie'' is Air Force Capt. Suzanne Sauer, who is stationed at
Offutt Air Force Base, just miles from where the photo album was
found.
   ``I was dumbfounded,'' Sauer said. ``I said, `I can't believe
you did this for me.'''
   Sauer said the album apparently fell out of her car while she
was moving.
   Beebe said he enjoyed the challenge and refused any reward,
including reimbursement for his long-distance phone calls.

   David Horning's 40th birthday celebration
started in Moscow and ended in San Francisco, but you couldn't call
it a bash.
   Call it a wash perhaps _ he marked the event by swimming under
three bridges in different parts of the world.
   Twenty-nine hours after his personal challenge began in Moscow,
Horning walked out of San Francisco Bay Wednesday night to be
greeted by a crowd of mostly strangers.
   ``It was great,'' he said with a smile. ``It's great to be 40.''
   Horning began the day in Moscow with a 3.7-mile swim in the
Moscow River in the capital of the Soviet Union. Then he jumped on
a jet to New York and swam a mile in the East River and under the
Brooklyn Bridge. Then he flew back to San Francisco to splash
through the fog and the final two miles.
   Celebrating his birthday with exotic swims has become a
tradition for Horning, beginning in 1982 when he swam around
Manhattan.
   ``Moscow was great, New York was great and it's great to be
home,'' the Berkeley resident said when he got out of the water.
``I've never swum out here at night before, but it was great''
   The crowd chanted ``Swim, Dave, swim!'' and then sang ``Happy
Birthday'' when Horning came ashore.

   The Disney Channel has chosen a Broadway
and movie veteran to portray the childhood companion of Mississippi
writer Willie Morris. And Morris says he's glad they got an
intelligent dog who can drive.
   ``Old Skip would be highly pleased that he's being played by a
Broadway and movie dog,'' Morris said about the selection of Moose
to play his pet in the production of Morris' 1971 book, ``Good Ole
Boy.''
   The full-length, made-for-cable movie was filmed in and around
Natchez.
   In June, Morris said he hoped a superstar dog would be chosen to
play Old Skip. Disney auditioned some local dogs, but finally
settled on Moose.
   Set in the 1940s, the story is about Morris' boyhood in Yazoo
City. The dog in the book goes shopping, plays football, becomes a
hero and teases the townspeople by pretending to drive a car.
   The role of Old Skip went to Moose, who played Sandy, the canine
pal of Orphan Annie, in a national Broadway tour of the musical
``Annie.'' The Airedale also performed in the off-Broadway
production of the ``Miracle Worker,'' and appeared with Robin
Williams in the PBS movie ``Seize the Day.''
   ``I'm very impressed. Moose did drive a car in a couple of
scenes, which is crucial,'' Morris said.
   ``I do like his looks,'' Morris said of Moose. ``Although he is
from Staten Island, he has all the appearances of a Mississippi
dog. He barks with a Southern accent. I think that comes from
acting experience.''

<TEXT>
   Abe Fortas was tricked into taking a
seat on the U.S. Supreme Court and later was bluffed into becoming
the first justice ever to resign in disgrace, the author of a new
book said Thursday.
   Using records President Lyndon Johnson once ordered destroyed,
author Bruce Allen Murphy also details Fortas' extensive role as an
adviser in the president's inner circle, unprecedented for a
sitting justice.
   ``The book is like a murder mystery: Who killed Abe Fortas'
career?'' said Murphy, whose research took him to libraries in
Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington and New Haven, Conn. His
book, ``Fortas: The Rise and Ruin of a Supreme Court Justice,''
will be released Friday.
   Johnson repeatedly asked Fortas to accept the nomination for a
seat on the Supreme Court, but the prominent Washington attorney
each time turned down the offer.
   LBJ got Fortas to accept the job in 1965 by saying the president
needed his friend's help drafting a statement to the press on a
troop increase in Vietnam.
   While they rode the White House elevator to the East Room to
meet the press, Johnson told Fortas that in a few minutes he would
be announced as the nominee to the Supreme Court.
   Four years after he joined the Supreme Court, Fortas resigned
for accepting a $20,000-a-year salary to work for a foundation set
up by millionaire industrialist Louis Wolfson while he was a member
of the court. Supreme Court justices made $39,500 at the time.
   Attorney General John Mitchell's Justice Department bluffed
Fortas into leaving the court by intimating it had more damaging
evidence than the money from Wolfson, which had been returned,
Murphy said.
   Murphy discovered photocopies of Justice Department documents in
the papers of the late Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   Fortas, who died in 1982, ``represents the turning point in the
United State Supreme Court history in the 20th century,'' said
Murphy.
   Without Fortas, liberal Arthur Goldberg would have remained on
the bench and might have succeeded Warren as chief justice during
the Johnson administration, said Murphy, 36, a professor of
political science at Penn State University.
   Instead, Johnson persuaded Goldberg to leave the court to become
ambassador to the United Nations to make room for Fortas.
   The Senate rejected Fortas' nomination as chief justice and his
1969 resignation allowed Richard Nixon to appoint two members of
the court and making the court more conservative, Murphy said.
   Johnson ordered all his files on Fortas destroyed during the
tough Senate confirmation hearings for Fortas as chief justice,
Murphy said.
   Aides disobeyed the order and sent the papers, locked in a safe,
to the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, where Murphy,
who spent six years researching his book, found them.
   Fortas destroyed all his own personal and professional records,
even typed copies of speeched he delivered.
   In the file at the Johnson Library, Murphy found records of
White House meetings Fortas attended on proposed legislation,
Johnson's speeches and the Vietnam War.
   Murphy, who had only one interview with Fortas before he died,
said Fortas' soft, melodious voice, sharp analytical mind and
ability to convert complex legal issues into understandable terms
caused his rise from poverty in Memphis, Tenn., to Washington's
inner circles.
   Murphy also explored extra-judicial activities in ``The
Brandeis-Frankfurter Connection: The Secret Political Activities of
Two Supreme Court Justices,'' which was published in 1982.

   Republican George Bush has called more than a
dozen prospective running mates, aides said Thursday, while Bush
himself said merely that his selection effort has been orderly and
that public speculation is inevitable.
   Widening the list of prospects, Bush and aides have been in
contact several times this week with Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., whose
name did not figure in earlier speculation.
   Quayle spokesman Jeff Nesbit said that the vice president had
called Quayle on Monday, and that the call was followed up by a
visit to Quayle's office on Tuesday by Robert M. Kimmitt, the
Washington lawyer who is overseeing the screening process of
potential candidates.
   Bush aides further contacted Quayle on Thursday, Nesbit said.
   ``He would accept it if asked,'' Nesbit said.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., also confirmed on Thursday that
he had been approached by the vice president, saying he was proud
and honored to be on the list. ``I know it will be a difficult
decision for the vice president to make,'' he said in a statement.
   Bush, who says he will not make his final choice until the
Republican National Convention next month, has now all but
completed calls to prospective candidates on his so-called ``long
list,'' said an aide who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
   ``He's only talking to people he's considering,'' said the aide.
   ``I would suspect that process is complete,'' the aide said.
``That doesn't preclude some new calls tomorrow or the next day.
The process is fluid and he's controlling it.''
   Campaign sources said the vice president had earlier placed
similar calls to _ or contacted personally _ his strongest
primary-campaign rival, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kans.; Dole's wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, and Sens. Domenici, Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., William L. Armstrong, R-Colo, John Danforth,
R-Mo., and Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kans.
   Also already contacted, the sources said, were Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y., Governors Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, John Sununu of New
Hampshire, Carroll A.Campbell of South Carolina, George Deukmejian
of California, and former Governors Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
and Richard Thornburg of Pennsylvania, who recently was nominated
by President Reagan to be attorney general.
   One on the list, Bob Dole, wasn't acknowledging his call, at
least publicly. He joked that he and his wife had been ``waiting
for the phone to ring at home. I can't get Elizabeth to leave the
house.''
   Speaking at a fund-raising breakfast, the Senate minority leader
joked that he hoped Bush's choice of a running mate would be
narrowed to just him and his wife, ``and I drop out.''
   However, Bush himself told reporters last week that Bob Dole
would be on ``any list'' of potential running mates.
   Calls from the vice president were an early stage of the
selection process. Bush had said he hoped to have a tentative list
completed by week's end.
   Washington attorney Robert M. Kimmitt is overseeing the
screening process, including the distribution of questionnaires
seeking financial and personal background information from
prospective candidates.
   The vice president told reporters outside his White House office
on Thursday that speculation over his running mate was inevitable.
``You can't avoid speculation,'' Bush said.
   ``The process is going along in an orderly fashion. Hopefully,
it won't be demeaning to anyone,'' he said.
   Bush, who had no public events scheduled on Thursday, was to
visit a child-care center Friday morning in a northern Virginia
suburb of Washington.
   ``He wanted to follow up on his child-care initiative,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   Bush on Sunday proposed a $1,000 tax credit for child care
primarily aimed at low-income working mothers.
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said that recent
polls showing Bush trailing Michael Dukakis by as much as 18 points
coming out of the Democratic National Convention had been expected.
   ``I figured it could go up to 20 points,'' Atwater said in an
interview. ``Polls right after a convention don't mean anything.''
   ``As Walter Mondale said in l984, `Where's the beef?''' Atwater
said, referring to the 1984 Democratic presidential candidate's use
of a fast-food advertising slogan to refer to then-rival Gary
Hart's Democratic primary theme of ``new ideas.''
   ``There's no substance whatsoever in Dukakis' campaign,''
Atwater said. ``We're going to point out over and over again that
George Bush's campaign is one of issues and substance.''

   Here, at a glance, are the key provisions of
far-reaching bank deregulation legislation approved, 30-20,
Thursday by the House Banking Committee:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SECURITIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The bill grants bank holding companies the power, through
separately capitalized subsidiaries, to underwrite corporate bonds,
mutual funds, commerical paper, corporate debt convertible to stock
and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer loans.
   A bank would not have to form a holding company to underwrite
municipal bonds or to sell shares in a mutual fund underwritten by
another company.
   Securities firms retain exclusive rights to the biggest area of
securities underwriting: corporate stock.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAFEGUARDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Affiliated banks and securities firms are barred from sharing
the same name, logo, advertising or premises. The securities
subsidiary will be required to inform customers they are not
dealing with a federally insured bank.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The legislation limits banks' ability to expand into insurance.
National banks and state-chartered banks owned by holding
companies, which are regulated on the federal level, will not be
allowed to underwrite insurance, unless they already do so.
Free-standing state banks remain governed by state laws.
   If state law permits, state banks will be allowed to sell
insurance, unless they are owned by an out-of-state holding
company. There is an exemption for national banks serving
communities of 5,000 population and less.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAL ESTATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   National banks and state banks owned by a holding company will
be banned for two years from entering the real estate business.
Banks currently engaged in real estate activies may continue.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONSUMERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Banks will be required to demonstrate a good record of lending
to poor neighborhoods before receiving Federal Reserve Board
permission to engage in new powers. Agricultural banks with assets
of less than $50 million and all commercial banks with assets less
than $25 million are exempted
   Banks will also be required to offer low-fee, low-service
``lifeline'' checking accounts to poor customers. They can be
opened for as little as $25 and can have a balance as high as
$1,000. However, customers will have to pay extra to write more
than 10 checks per month.
   Special checking accounts must be offered to poor people who
only want to cash government checks up to $1,500 such as Social
Security and welfare payments. No more than $2 may be charged per
check for the cashing service.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. official made the first disclosure of the
location of American production facilities for chemical weapons in
an attempt Thursday to speed talks aimed at banning the manufacture
and use of such weapons.
   In Washington, an Army spokesman said chemical weapons were
being produced or stored at only two of the five sites named by Max
Friedersdorf, chief U.S. delegate to the 40-nation Conference on
Disarmament.
   Friedersdorf told the conference his announcement was an
unprecedented step toward greater openness.
   The United States previously declared the location of its
stockpiles and the types of chemicals contained in them, but not
the amount or the location of the production facilities. The Soviet
Union has declared the amount of its stockpiles, but not their
location, nor the location of production sites.
   Friedersdorf said his delegation hoped the declaration would
``contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of
related provisions'' of a convention banning the production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
   The Geneva conference has been negotiating such a convention for
20 years. This year's summer session began July 7.
   ``The declaration we are making today is unprecedented,''
Friedersdorf said, adding that no other conference member had
provided information on chemical weapons production facilities.
   ``We urge other countries that possess chemical weapons
production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities
and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed,'' he said.
   The United States and Soviet Union are the only two members of
the conference who have acknowledged possessing chemical weapons.
Many conference members have declared that they do not possess
chemical weapons, but Friedersdorf indicated in his speech that the
United States does not believe some of them. He declined to say
which countries.
   Washington has said previously it believes about 15 nations
possess such weapons, but it consistently declines to identify them.
   In December, the Soviet Union said its chemical weapon stocks
total 50,000 tons, but Western experts have estimated the total is
much higher. The Soviet Union also said it had no stocks outside
its borders, a contention that also has been challenged by the
United States.
   The production facilities declared by the United States are
Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado; the Pine Bluff Arsenal in
Arkansas, which produces the new binary chemical weapons; Muscle
Shoals in Alabama; Newport Army Ammunition Depot in Indiana; and
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
   At the Pentagon, Lt. Col. John Chapla said chemical weapons
currently are produced or stored only at Pine Bluff and Muscle
Shoals.
   ``These are locations which are at present or were at one time
involved in the production of chemical weapons,'' Chapla said of
Friedersdorf's list. ``At Rocky Mountain and Newport, there is no
chemical weapon production, testing or storage going on.''
   Chapla said Aberdeen is used to test some components of the
current generation of chemical weapons but is not used to produce,
store or test the binary, or dual chemical, weapons the military
now uses.
   ``Our focus now is the production of binary chemical,
principally at Pine Bluff,'' he said.
   Some work is also done at Muscle Shoals on one of the chemicals
used in binary weapons but the weapon is not deadly until the two
chemicals are combined, Chapla said.
   ``The binary program is such that you never have a complete
weapon stored in any one place,'' he said. ``The two chemicals are
never kept together and they will not be mated until just before
firing.''
   At the Geneva conference, the United States also submitted to
the conference ideas for methods to destroy chemical weapons under
an eventual ban.
   Delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban. The
main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating.
   Other problems include ensuring that the maximum number of
countries joins the ban, maintaining a military balance while
stocks are gradually destroyed, and precisely defining chemical
weapons.
   Friedersdorf said in his speech that ``an agreed definition (of
chemical weapons) is within reach'' and the conference has made
``significant progress'' toward resolving some issues in the past
months. He did not elaborate.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen told a union audience Thursday that the only time the
Reagan administration cares about American workers is ``when they
want to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines.''
   Later Thursday, in a speech in Reno, Nev., Bentsen criticized
Reagan administration drug-fighting efforts. He also planned to
visit Los Angeles and Amarillo, Texas, on his first solo campaign
trip since being nominated last week in Atlanta.
   The United Food and Commercial Workers convention gave a noisy
welcome to Bentsen in San Francisco. Many of the 3,500 members in
the audience were wearing ``I Like Mike'' T-shirts and waving
union-prepared signs for presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and
Bentsen.
   Earlier this year, the union was credited by lawmakers with
helping with compromise language in legislation that barred most
polygraph tests of job applicants by private businesses.
Administration officials had opposed the separate versions passed
by the House and Senate, but President Reagan signed the compromise
final version last spring.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimated
that about 2 million polygraph tests are given each year, most of
them by private businesses.
   Four years ago, Reagan received nearly half the votes of the
traditionally Democratic members of the union, said spokesman Al
Zack. But he released a poll _ taken prior to last week's
Democratic National Convention _ showing the 1.1 million-member
union was 2-to-1 in favor of the Democrats this year.
   ``Those union members who were hoodwinked by Ronald Reagan are
coming home, in droves,'' said UFCW President William H. Wynn.
   The convention was to hear from Dukakis later by satellite
television hookup. After that, Wynn scheduled action on a
resolution putting his union on record in favor of the ticket and
requesting the parent AFL-CIO to make a formal endorsement.
   Bentsen made the most of his Senate record before the crowd,
citing this year's fights with the Reagan administration over the
trade bill and the sixty-days notice for plant closings.
   The Texas senator said administration officials have ``dragged
their feet for eight years'' when action was needed to help
American industry compete. ``Their indifference has cost America
more than a million manufacturing jobs and caused trade deficits
that will cripple growth,'' Bentsen said.
   ``Sure, the Reagan-Bush administration occasionally pays
attention to working men and women in America _ like when they want
to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines,'' he said.
   He said the Reagan-Bush record for women and minorities amounted
to a ``speed bump on the path to equality in America.''
   Later, in Reno, Bentsen blasted the Reagan administration for
``chaos that exists in drug control.''
   He told the National Conference of State Legislators that ``our
war against drugs lacks a commander.'' He said a Bentsen-Dukakis
administration would appoint a single drug czar to oversee the
battle.
   Bentsen said Dukakis' experience in state government gave him an
affinity with local officials, and he said the Democratic White
House would recognize the costs to state government when the
federal government cuts back on its programs.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have blamed the
fatal 1985 Frankfurt bombing on Abu Nidal's terrorist group and
found a possible Libyan connection, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Frankfurter Neue Presse said a special commission of law
enforcement officials had identified the attackers and authorities
were seeking arrest warrants for Abu Nidal and three alleged
accomplices.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the chief federal
prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, told The Associated Press the
commission had ``firmed up'' suspicions against Abu Nidal and his
supporters but denied warrants were being sought.
   For more than three years, West German investigators have tried
to pin down who planted the bomb that exploded in crowded passenger
terminal at Frankfurt Airport on June 19, 1985, killing three
people and wounding 42. They had expressed suspicion of the
Palestinian terrorist group before.
   Foerster's office is represented on the commission and acts as
its spokesman, but also is conducting its own inquiry.
   Hesse state officials established the commission a few months
after the bombing.
   Abu Nidal is a former Jerusalem school teacher and his real name
is Sabry al-Banna. He is based in Libya and Syria.
   Israeli, Arab and Western intelligence agencies have accused him
of directing scores of terrorist attacks since he broke in 1976
with Fatah, the mainstream guerrilla faction led by Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat. Abu Nidal has been
blamed for coordinated assaults at Rome and Vienna airports Dec.
27, 1985, in which 20 people were killed.
   His group also was linked by Greek authorities to the terrorist
attack July 11 on the City of Poros cruise ship, in which nine
people were killed and 98 wounded.
   According to the newspaper, the West German panel also decided
agents of Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, may have played
a role in the attack.
   ``The investigations have shown that the Libyan People's Bureau
in Bonn, as the embassy is called, had knowledge of the attack,''
it said. ``Whether it was involved in the preparation and execution
still cannot be proven.''
   Foerster did not say when Kurt Rebmann, the chief federal
prosecutor, might be ready to file criminal charges.

<HEAD>Britain Reported to Install Block Against Computer Sabotage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have equipped Britain's intelligence
listening post with a system that works like a computer detective
to ferret out software sabotage, the domestic news agency reported.
   Press Association said the new equipment will help avert
sabotage by computer amateurs known as hackers and by enemies who
use ``computer viruses,'' alien coding that insinuates itself into
a system.
   The detecting system was installed at the Government
Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham, about 110 miles
northwest of London, the agency reported. The listening facility
sifts through radio and other airborne messages, seeking military
and other secret communications.
   ``The nation's enemies have almost certainly tried to place
damaging software within our systems,'' Rupert Soames, managing
director of GPT Data Systems, was quoted as saying. His company
developed the system.
   A computer virus is a small piece of code inserted into a system
to corrupt data. It can infect other computers through networks or
exchanged software, or can lie dormant until a pre-determined
command activates it.
   ``One of the main concerns with the Strategic Defense Initiative
in the United States is its vulnerability to viruses and logic
bombs which would only trigger under war conditions,'' Soames was
quoted as saying.
   The SDI space-defense project, commonly called ``Star Wars,''
program, would use computer-guided lasers to shoot down enemy
missiles.
   Soames told the news agency several American companies have
expressed interest in the detecting system.

<TEXT>
   A federal drug agent testified Thursday he was
told that a White House aide leaked details of one of the
government's most sensitive cocaine investigations _ thus ending it
prematurely _ in order to expose drug smuggling by the Nicaraguan
government.
   Ernst Jacobsen, an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said that following the leak in July 1984, ``I
heard from my superiors the leak came from an aide in the White
House.''
   While Jacobsen did not name the official, the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime released pages from Oliver L. North's diary
showing the former National Security Council aide made frequent
references to the operation in the weeks before the leak.
   And the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the
investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a Nicaraguan
airstrip. A purported Nicaraguan government official who aided the
smuggling operation was in the pictures.
   Jacobsen, testifying from behind a screen to hide his identity,
also said that shortly before the leak, a CIA agent in Miami told
him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news media
to show Sandinista involvement in smuggling.
   The hearing was the first in a series by the crime subcommittee
into whether Reagan administration officials condoned drug
smuggling and other criminal activities to further its Central
American policy _ especially winning aid for the Contra rebels.
   The panel is particularly interested in whether administration
officials obstructed law enforcement operations, as may have
occurred in the 1984 nvestigation.
   Panel Chairman William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said a vote on aid to
the Reagan administration-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua was
moving through Congress when the story was leaked on Sandinista
drug smuggling.
   Jacobsen said the leak ended ``one of the most significant
cocaine investigations in DEA history,'' which he said could have
led to the arrest of the entire leadership of Colombia's cocaine
cartel. The cartel was operating inside Nicaragua at the time,
Jacobsen said.
   Jacobsen testified that convicted drug pilot Barry Seal was
working for the DEA in the sting operation, and had made contact
with the cartel and Federico Vaughn, whom Jacobsen described as a
Nicaraguan interior ministry employee.
   However, the subcommittee also released information that cast
doubt on Vaughn's connection with the Nicaraguan government.
   Hughes said the subcommittee staff recently called Vaughn's
number in Managua, Nicaragua, and spoke to a ``domestic employee''
who said the house belonged to a U.S. Embassy employee. The
employee, who was not named, was among a group of U.S. officials
expelled recently by Nicaragua's leftist government, Hughes said.
   Hughes said his investigators were told the house has been
``continuously rented'' by the United States since 1981. He later
told reporters that Vaughn's name never surfaced before the drup
operation, ``and no one knew about him afterwards.''
   Jacobsen said, ``To our knowledge, Federico Vaughn had no
association with the U.S. Embassy or anything related to the U.S.
government.''
   North's diary, however, had several references to ``Freddy
Vaughn'' including a July 6 entry that said, ``Freddy coming in
late July.''
   In the undercover operation, Seal had flown to a Nicaragua
airstrip in a plane that had cameras installed by the CIA, Jacobsen
said. The agent said the pictures had been developed at CIA
headquarters near Washington and then ``taken to the White House.''
   ``The CIA wanted to release them to the press, to show the
Sandinistas were dealing in cocaine,'' Jacobsen said.
   The agent said DEA officials initially persuaded the CIA to
change its mind, but shortly afterwards, the story on the operation
appeared in The Washington Times.
   He said that story caused the DEA to frantically make all the
arrests possible at that point, but the operation was over.
   A second DEA official who testified after Jacobsen said he met
with North about the operation before the news story was leaked,
and the former NSC aide ``asked when the operation could go
public.''
   Ron Caffrey, who was in charge of the DEA cocaine desk at the
time, said North ``did indicate to me there was a vote coming up on
an appropriation bill to aid the Contras. I told him public
disclosure would come from the U.S. attorney or the attorney
general ... but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation.''
   Caffrey added that North came up with a plan to use the
investigation to aide the Contras.
   The agent said he told North that the chief DEA operative in the
sting planned to fly $1.5 million into Nicaragua to pay for drugs
already brought back from that country.
   ``Colonel North asked why we couldn't land the plane outside
Managua and turn the money over to the Contras,'' Caffrey said,
adding he told North that plan would jeopardize the operation.
   Frank Monastero, former assistant administrator of the DEA, told
the subcommittee that the day the news story appeared, an irate
North called him to deny that he was responsible for the leak.
   Monastero said that North accused the DEA of telling a reporter
that North was the source of the information.
   ``He called to say he did not leak the information and the proof
was the facts (in the story) were not accurate,'' Monastero said.
``My response was, `That's the standard way to cover your tracks.'
I didn't accept that.''
   Monastero said at another point, ``I thought the leak came from
the White House because of the Contra vote that was coming up.''

   The fire that destroyed her
home Thursday was one of many hardships that have beset Winnie
Mandela since her husband Nelson, the African National Congress
leader, was sent to prison 26 years ago.
   She has spent 17 months in solitary confinement, lived in
isolation, been arrested several times and passed virtually her
entire adult life under stringent police restrictions and public
scrutiny.
   Mrs. Mandela is 54 and was trained as a social worker. She has
become a leading campaigner against apartheid and black activists
often call her ``Mother of the Nation.''
   Her commanding presence, controversial statements and
willingness to confront authorities has made her one of the most
visible symbols of opposition to white domination in South Africa.
   Another result of her prominence is that some of her personal
hardships become public events.
   When she visits her husband at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town,
journalists are there.
   By the time she reached her burned-out home Thursday it was
surrounded by firefighters, police and journalists who already had
wandered through the smoldering remains. Mrs. Mandela saw the
crowd, stayed in her car and went directly to an office she
maintains nearby.
   Friends said the house held all her belongings, including
wedding photographs, family documents and the piano her husband
used to play.
   Mrs. Mandela moved into the modest four-room bungalow in Soweto,
Johannesburg's huge black township, after she married Mandela in
1958. Mandela had owned the house and lived in it since the 1940s.
   It has been shot at and stoned by attackers who have not been
identified. Police visit it regularly.
   After Mandela's arrest in 1962, Mrs. Mandela began receiving
banning orders that prohibited her from addressing public
gatherings, meeting with more than one person and entering places
ranging from schools to printing houses.
   They applied from 1963 to 1986 except for one 18-month period.
   From May 1969 to September 1970 she was held in solitary
confinement, tried twice under the Terrorism Act and acquitted both
times.
   Mrs. Mandela was imprisoned for six months in 1974 for violating
the banning order and detained for four months in 1976 after riots
in Soweto.
   A banning order issued in 1977 forced her to leave the Soweto
house and move to Brandfort in the rural Orange Free State. Her
home and office there were burned down in 1985 and she was allowed
to return to the home in Soweto a year later.
   Her defiance undimmed, Mrs. Mandela declared on her return: ``I
should never have been away from home in the first place. I am
grateful to no one. It was my right to be at home.''
   The Mandelas have two daughters. Zindzi, 27, lives with her
mother, and Zenani, 29, is studying at Boston University in the
United States with her husband, a member of Swaziland's royal
family.

   The home that has belonged to Nelson
Mandela and his family since the 1940s was gutted in an arson
attack Thursday that apparently involved a teen-gang dispute and
was not aimed at Mandela himself.
   Police said no one was hurt and no arrests were made.
   Capt. Ruben Bloomberg said in Pretoria that 30 to 50 black high
school students stoned the home of the imprisoned leader of the
African National Congress, doused it with gasoline and set it afire.
   Neighbors and black journalists said some attackers wore jackets
of Daliwonga high school in Soweto, and were involved in a dispute
Wednesday with the young black ``comrades'' who guard the home.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, was
bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned
of the fire, which broke out about noon (6 a.m. EDT). Her daughter,
Zindzi, 27, and her two grandchildren, who also live at the
four-room home, were away at the time.
   But neighbors and journalists said some of the ``comrades'' who
often travel with Mrs. Mandela and guard her home were at the house
when the fire began.
   State of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said leaders in Soweto and other black
townships had been asked ``to call upon the community not to act
emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a
spiral of violence.''
   He said an attempt would be made to talk to the principal and
the students of the school involved to ease the situation. He said
young men who congregate around the Mandela home were told ``not to
act without thinking or with revenge.''
   Although the dispute is local, he said, ``when it is Mandela's
house that is attacked, that makes it a national issue. Anybody who
attacks a well-known leader's house like that one would know they
would anger the people in the community and cause them to take
action.''
   Mrs. Mandela arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the
blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the
car. She then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts
social welfare projects.
   The ``comrades,'' some wearing jackets of the Mandela United
soccer club, sponsored by the family, pushed journalists away from
the office. One threatened to burn a photographer's car.
   Later, attorney Amrichand Soma told reporters Mandela was
reached at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where he is serving a
life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
white-dominated government, and said no statement should be made.
   However, Aubrey Mokoena, a family friend and head of the Release
Mandela Campaign, said: ``The community must ... put an end to
this. Anyone who would think of attacking Mandela's house
represents the forces of darkness.''
   Journalists were allowed to enter the still-smoking home in the
Orlando section of Soweto, while black police with shotguns kept a
crowd of 300 neighbors away. A sodden carpet of hot, black ash
covered everything.
   Flames flickered in a side room. The house was filled with steam
from the heat and the water. Firemen pushed clothes out a bedroom
window, pulled a smoldering mattress outside, shoved smoking
cabinets and chairs onto the lawn.
   All the contents, including framed wedding pictures and the
family piano, were destroyed.
   Mrs. Mandela has lived in the house periodically since she
married Mandela in 1958. Last year she built a mansion on a hill
overlooking this huge black township outside of Johannesburg, a few
blocks from the burned home. But Mokoena said the new house is not
habitable and she would spend the night with friends.
   Mandela moved into the house with his first wife, Evelyn, in the
1940s and raised his two sons and his oldest daughter there. Evelyn
Mandela lives in the Xhosa tribal homeland of Transkei.

<HEAD>Court Orders FEC to Respond to Dukakis-Bentsen Campaign Fund Suit</HEAD>

   A federal appeals court late Thursday ordered
the Federal Election Commission to respond to a request that the
presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen be
barred from spending federal campaign funds until a dispute over
the financing is resolved.
   The court order said the FEC must respond by Monday to a motion
to block the spending of the money, and the court invited lawyers
for the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign to respond as well.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee and Bentsen's GOP
opponent for the Texas Senate seat, Rep. Beau Boulter, are seeking
to block the federal campaign money. They charge that by running
simultaneously for the Senate and for vice president _ as Texas law
allows _ Bentsen gains an unfair financial advantage over
Republicans.
   The FEC rejected that argument on Tuesday when it released $46
million in federal campaign money for the Democratic ticket.
   Republicans appealed the FEC decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge panel
decided late Thursday to solicit arguments in the case. The appeal
contended that the FEC action was arbitrary and contrary to federal
campaign financing law and asked that the Democrats be barred from
spending any of the $46 million until the matter is resolved.
   ``The court has found this a serious enough issue to require its
review,'' said Ben Ginsberg, legal counsel for the GOP Senate
campaign committee. ``They are asking the FEC to say why it acted
properly.''
   The three-judge panel was made up of Chief Judge Spottswood W.
Robinson III, Judge Laurence Silberman, and Judge Douglas Ginsburg.
   Republicans say Bentsen has some $4 million in private funds set
aside for his Senate campaign which he can spend in Texas but which
will also benefit the party's presidential ticket, in effect
violating the $46 million spending ceiling for presidential
campaigns and the use of private money for the general election
race.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
turned up the heat on the Reagan administration and Attorney
General Edwin Meese on Thursday, saying if the Democratic ticket is
elected ``the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not some
place down the hall.''
   Dukakis also began wooing local supporters of former rival Jesse
Jackson as he campaigned across the industrial Northeast and
Midwest, holding meetings with former Jackson delegates and local
elected officials who backed Jackson in the Democratic primaries.
   The Massachusetts governor hammered at Meese and the Reagan
administration in a speech at an outdoor shopping mall in Secaucus,
N.J., in the Meadowlands area, and kept up the attack at a rally
before 2,000 people in downtown Cleveland.
   ``I want to tell you that in 1989, we're going to have a
president and vice president who won't sit by and do nothing when
they're told by high-ranking officials in the Justice Department
that the attorney general of the United States has been violating
the law,'' Dukakis said.
   His remarks included a dig at Vice President George Bush's
proposal this week to create a White House ethics office.
   He was referring to two former top Justice Department officials,
former assistant attorney general William Weld and former deputy
attorney general Arthur Burns, who told Congress earlier this week
that they had voiced concerns about Meese's actions before
resigning.
   ``I hope I never have to listen to that kind of briefing,''
Dukakis said. ``But if I do I can tell you I won't sit there and do
nothing. We'll take action.''
   Dukakis departed from the text of his prepared speech, devoted
to calling for investment in jobs and economic opportunity, to
comment on Meese and the broader subject of impropriety by some
serving in the Reagan administration. He repeated lines from his
nomination acceptance speech delivered at the Democratic National
Convention last week when he said in his administration those who
violate the public trust will be fired and ``if you violate the law
you'll be prosecuted.''
   In Cleveland, Dukakis praised, but was not accompanied by, the
state's two Democratic senators: John Glenn, whom he passed over in
selecting Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate, and Howard Metzenbaum,
who faces a tough re-election fight this year. In an interview with
a local television station, Dukakis said he picked Bentsen after
deciding the Texas senator ``had the right stuff'' _ a phrase that
recalled the title of the book and movie that depicted Glenn's life
as astronaut.
   Dukakis met privately with Jackson supporters in Newark, N.J.,
and in Cleveland, and spokesman Dayton Duncan said he would meet
with Jackson supporters Friday in Michigan _ the state where
Jackson stunned Dukakis with a two-one victory in the March
caucuses.
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who had been a Jackson delegate, said
some in the group had been disappointed by Dukakis' selection of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate but that all seemed
pleased by their 20-minute discussion with the nominee.
   ``Now we're ready to support Michael Dukakis _ he won,'' James
said, pointing to the new Dukakis '88 button he had just put on his
lapel.
   ``I have now replaced my Jesse Jackson button,'' he said in an
interview. ``... The alternative is to support George Bush or to do
nothing and allow Bush to win.''
   Donald Payne, a member of the Newark city council and Democratic
nominee for Congress, said Dukakis showed ``a very good grasp of
urban issues'' but made no commitment for more federal spending.
   Fletcher Wiley, a Dukakis senior adviser who sat in on the
meeting, said one purpose of Dukakis' campaign trip was to meet
with Jackson supporters in cities where he is stopping.
   Dukakis also stopped at a day-care center where he was
photographed talking with small children.
   In his speech, Dukakis spoke about his call for a ``new era of
greatness'' made in his acceptance speech. ``It begins with the
recognition that a strong economic future needs three fundamental
things _ investment, innovation and teamwork,'' he said.
   He called for more investment in research, including by business
leaders, to keep up with research and training by Japan and other
countries.
   ``I want to restore some balance to our federal research and
development programs, and we'd better not forget that our military
strength cannot be sustained without economic strength _ a lesson
the Soviet Union has finally learned, and we must too,'' he said.
   As Dukakis spoke, about a dozen anti-abortion protesters stood a
short distance away and chanted ``Civil Rights for Unborn Babies.''
The nominee walked close by them as he left.

<HEAD>Government Suspends Journalist Registration Plan Temporarily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government ordered a
temporary suspension Thursday of rules that would require some
journalists to register or face penalties, including jail.
   The regulations were to take effect Sunday. Media groups in
South Africa and abroad accused the South African government of
attempting to make further inroads on press freedom.
   Stoffel Botha, home affairs minister, said registration of
journalists ``remains a matter of grave concern for the
government,'' but the regulations were suspended temporarily
because of ``practical considerations.''
   He said they would be reviewed, but did not indicate when a
decision would be made. The broadly worded rules now say anyone
carrying out ``news-agency'' business must register or face a
10-year prison term or a $8,500 fine.
   South Africa's largest news agency, the South African Press
Association, and such major international agencies as The
Associated Press are exempt.
   Local journalists who work part-time for some of the world's
large news organizations would be required to register if, as many
do, they had more than one employer.
   Lawyers say the definition of a ``news agency'' is so broad that
major newspapers that exchange stories, church and political groups
that publish newsletters, and businesses that issue regular press
statements on their operations could be included if the government
wished.
   Under the regulations, Botha could remove journalists from the
registration list and prevent them from working if he objected to
their reporting. He already has broad censorship powers that allow
him to close publications and expel foreign journalists.
   The latest regulations appear aimed at small, local news
agencies but most news organizations operating in South Africa
would be affected because they get reports from those agencies.
   Botha has said local agencies endanger public safety by
reporting unfavorably on police activities, forced removals of poor
blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that other news
organizations do not cover regularly.
   The Foreign Correspondents Association of South Africa has said
even journalists not required to register would be compromised
because they would be seen as having favored status with the
government.
   State-of-emergency regulations already in force restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the
government considers subversive.
   Under the official apartheid policy, South Africa's 26 million
blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate residential districts,
schools and health services.

   Aides to Republican George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis traded barbs Thursday over an assertion by Bush
Campaign Manager Lee Atwater that Dukakis had ``commuted the
sentences of 58 violent criminals'' while governor of Massachusetts.
   Dukakis Campaign Manager Susan Estrich immediately denied the
claim, saying, ``Poor Lee. After his candidate failed in his
attempt to promote a positive message on either ethics or day care,
Lee is returning to the well-traveled low road preferred by
political muggers.''
   In a statement, Atwater said that among the 58 criminals whose
sentences he claimed Dukakis had commuted were ``28 first-degree
murderers and a convicted heroin dealer.''
   ``Dukakis ... also commuted the sentences of 25 convicted
second-degree murderers, some of whom had served sentences of as
little as two to five years,'' Atwater said.
   ``It appears that Mike Dukakis just can't stand the thought of
violent criminals spending time behind bars,'' Atwater said.
   Countered Ms. Estrich in a statement of her own: ``Lee should
stop distorting the facts. Under Michael Dukakis' leadership the
Massachusetts crime rate dropped l3 percent in five years while
crime nationally jumped 4 percent.''
   ``The homicide rate in Massachusetts is half the national
average and the lowest of any industrial state,'' she said.
   Leslie Dach, campaign communications director for the Democratic
nominee, said that ``for the record, Dukakis has commuted 10
sentences in six years.''
   ``Balderdash,'' said Bush spokesman Mark Goodin when told of the
response by the Dukakis aides. He said the figures the likely
Republican nominee used were taken from Massachusetts state records.
   ``The only reason crime has gone down in Massachusetts is that
Dukakis has let all the criminals out of jail and they've gone to
other states,'' Goodin said.
   Bush has repeatedly criticized a Massachusetts prison furlough
program that allowed passes for first-degree murderers. The program
was later amended, but not until after one of the prisoners escaped
from a furlough and raped a Maryland woman.

   Corbin Bernsen learned of his Emmy nomination
in a long-distance wake-up call from his mother; Ann Jillian heard
when she punched the telephone message playback button; and Betty
White heard it on the radio.
   Nominations for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
coveted Emmy Awards were announced Thursday. NBC-TV's ``L.A. Law''
swept the bulk of nods with 19.
   ``L.A. Law'' producer-creator Steven Bochco furiously hunted for
the telephone numbers of his far-flung cast to congratulate them.
Because of the 21-week Writers Guild of America strike, the actors
were hard to find.
   ``Normally everybody is hard at work so you just walk on stage
and tell them. Now we're looking for telephone numbers,'' said
Bochco, adding, ``We're very excited.''
   The on-screen and real life husband-wife duo Michael Tucker and
Jill Eikenberry, called the ``Tucker-Berrys'' by the ``L.A. Law''
crew, were out of town. Tucker was doing a film in Montreal and his
wife was in North Carolina.
   ``We will find them somehow,'' said Bochco.
   ``Steve called me. I'm thrilled,'' said Alan Rachins, another of
the show's nominees, and ``L.A. Law'' star Susan Dey was especially
taken with surprise at her nomination, wondering aloud what she
would wear to the ceremony.
   Bernsen got a wakeup call in Milwaukee from his mother, actress
Jeanne Cooper, who told him of his nomination. She was nominated
last year for her ``L.A. Law'' guest role playing Bernsen's mother.
   ``She just said, `I'm sorry I woke you up, but congratulations.'
I said, `What for?' and she told me I got a nomination,'' he said.
   Bernsen, who has just begun filming the the movie ``Major
League'' with Charlie Sheen and Tom Berringer, was then read a list
of his competitors and exclaimed ``Great!'' when he learned co-star
Tucker was nominated.
   ``Pretty good guys to be with, I'd say. Now I'll see who my
friends are,'' he said.
   Bernsen and Bochco said the key to ``L.A. Law's'' success could
be a sophistication that appeals to audiences young and old.
   ``It has the serial thing people like to follow and it's got
sophistication. As I've always said, I think we acknowledge the
intelligence of the viewing audience,'' Bernsen said.
   ``We like to think we don't insult them,'' Bochco said. ``We
have good stories and that great ensemble group. We draw
inspiration from their ability.''
   Miss Jillian was overwhelmed by the two nominations for the NBC
movie ``The Ann Jillian Story'' _ leading actress in a miniseries
or special and best drama-comedy special. It dealt with her battle
with breast cancer.
   ``I woke up, stumbled into the living room and I pushed the
(telephone) message unit and a voice said, `Congratulations on your
Emmy nomination.' I just couldn't believe it,'' she said.
   ``I'm very honored and very thrilled, but the nomination isn't
for me. It goes for all those ladies who had to go through this. I
tried to do this with dignity and above all hope. I'm so grateful.''
   Actor Tim Busfield, nominated for supporting actor in the drama
series ``thirtysomething,'' was acknowledged for an episode dealing
with a marriage counseling session.
   ``I owe this to all the women I've ever had fights with,'' he
said.
   Miss White was putting on her makeup when she heard about her
third nomination for ``The Golden Girls.''
   ``Isn't this exciting? I can't believe it,'' she said. Asked if
an Emmy nomination meant much this third time, she said, ``Sure, I
don't take it lightly. It's your peer group saying they like you.''
   Miss White and ``Golden Girl'' Rue McClanahan have won past
acting Emmys, so both are now rooting for wins this time by
co-stars Beatrice Arthur and Estelle Getty. All four are nominated,
Miss Getty in the supporting actress category.

   The designer of the Vietnam War Memorial
said Thursday she hopes her latest work, a somber monument to the
civil rights movement, will make people remember the bloody
struggle for racial equality.
   ``The Vietnam Memorial has an impact on the immediate family.
This is about the importance of not forgetting the civil rights
movement,'' said Maya Lin, whose black wall in Washington bearing
the names of dead American soldiers has prompted emotional
outpourings.
   Ms. Lin said the planned civil rights monument will bear the
names of about 30 people killed during the civil rights era of the
1950s and '60s.
   ``The name is one of the most magical ways to bring back a
person,'' she said. ``It's more real than any one image can be.''
   The $350,000 memorial will be located on a slope in front of the
Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery-based, public-interest
law firm specializing in civil rights issues.
   The memorial will be a short walk from the church where a young
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gained prominence by leading the
Montgomery bus boycott, often cited as the start of the
contemporary American civil rights movement.
   Ms. Lin's design calls for an upper plaza with a quiet pool and
water that cascades down the face of a curved, black wall 40 feet
long. Inscribed in gold leaf on the wall will be a section of
King's ``I Have a Dream Speech,'' saying: ``We will not be
satisfied until justice rolls down like water and righteousness
like a mighty stream.''
   In the lower plaza, a circular stone table 12 feet in diameter
will be inscribed with time lines and the names of people killed
during the civil rights movement from 1955 to 1968. Water emerging
from the center of the table will flow evenly across its surface.
   The time lines will begin with the Aug. 28, 1955, murder of
Emmett Till in Money, Miss. Till, a black man, was lynched after
saying ``Bye, baby,'' to a white woman. The historical review will
end April 4, 1968: the day King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn.
   In addition to Till and King, among those listed will be Medgar
Evers, a Mississippi NAACP official gunned down in front of his
home in 1963; four children killed in 1963 when a bomb exploded at
the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; and three men shot to
death in Philadelphia, Miss., during the ``Freedom Summer'' of 1964.
   Construction of the memorial will begin later this year, with
completion scheduled for May 1989. The project will be funded by
proceeds from the recent sale of property adjacent to law center.

   George Bush said Thursday his search for a Republican running
mate is proceeding in an ``orderly fashion,'' but offered no clues
about the outcome. Democrat Michael Dukakis renewed his attack on
the vice president's handling of Attorney General Edwin Meese's
legal difficulties.
   ``The process is going along in an orderly fashion,'' Bush told
reporters. ``Hopefully, it won't be demeaning to anyone.''
   Sources said that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole had been
notified by Bush that he was under consideration, among about a
dozen prospects. Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana also is under
consideration, at least in a preliminary way, said one source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Three Republicans are known to have received Bush campaign
requests for background information, including Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York, who has figured prominently in speculation, and Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico and New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who have
not.
   Dukakis embarked on a hectic campaign swing through seven
Eastern and Midwestern states, combining fresh criticism for Bush
with a renewed effort to reach out to Jesse Jackson's
primary-campaign supporters.
   He said that if the Democrats win the White House this fall,
``the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not some place down
the hall.'' That was a jab at Bush, who said in a speech earlier in
the week that he would appoint a special counselor on ethics to
work in the White House and other agencies of the federal
government.
   Dukakis also said that beginning next year, ``we're going to
have a president and vice president who won't sit by and do nothing
when they're told by high-ranking officials in the Justice
Department that the attorney general of the United States has been
violating the law.''
   The Massachusetts governor's comment was a reference to
congressional testimony earlier this week by two former top Justice
Department aides, who said they had told President Reagan and Bush
last spring that they had concerns about Meese's legal difficulties.
   Dukakis also met privately in New Jersey with about two dozen
local officials, most of them black, who backed Jackson's drive for
the Democratic presidential nomination. Newark Mayor Sharpe James
said the group was ``ready to support Michael Dukakis. ... The
alternative is to support George Bush or to do nothing and allow
Bush to win.''
   Dukakis' post-convention high in the polls continued Thursday,
as a Harris poll gave him an 18-point lead over Bush. But pollster
Louis Harris said such a wide margin was likely to be ``very
temporary.''
   Harris' survey of 1,268 likely voters found 57 percent support
for Dukakis to 39 percent for Bush. It was the fourth national poll
since the Democratic convention last week to find a Dukakis lead of
that magnitude.
   The new Harris poll was done July 22-25 and had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   Topic No. 1 in Republican circles was Bush's search for a
running mate _ and the campaign signals were anything but clear.
   One senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
vice president had personally telephoned about a dozen prospective
running mates to notify them they are being considered.
   Aside from Dole and Kemp, the names that have surfaced most
consistently in speculation include California Gov. George
Deukmejian, Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson and Sens. Nancy Kassebaum of
Kansas and Alan Simpson of Wyoming. Dole's wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, also has been mentioned as
a possible contender.
   Dole joked during the day that he and his wife have been
``waiting for the phone to ring at home. I can't get Elizabeth to
leave the house.''
   The Republican guessing game flourished while Democratic vice
presidential candidate Bentsen told the United Food and Commercial
Workers convention in San Francisco that the Reagan-Bush record for
women and minorities is a ``speed bump on the path to equality in
America.''
   Meanwhile, Jackson said he has asked the United Nations
secretary-general to ask Iranian officials for assistance in
freeing U.S. hostages held by Iranian sympathizers in Lebanon.
   But Jackson said ``no meeting has been set, and no meeting has
been sought'' for him to negotiate personally with Iranian
officials.
   ``We've simply talked through Secretary-General (Javier Perez)
de Cuellar, who did meet with the Iranian foreign minister,'' he
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   Bush, in an interview published in USA Today, called Jackson a
``loose cannon'' and said he should stay out of the hostage affair.
   Dukakis said he was unfamiliar with the facts about Jackson's
effort, ``but as a general matter private citizens should not try
to conduct foreign policy.''
   In Washington, the dispute over $46 million in federal campaign
money for Dukakis entered a new phase as a federal appeals court
ordered the Federal Elections Commission to respond to a request
that the funds be held up.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee and Bentsen's GOP
opponent for his Texas Senate seat, Rep. Beau Boulter, are seeking
to block the money. They charge that by running simultaneously for
the Senate and for vice president _ as Texas law allows _ Bentsen
gains an unfair financial advantage over Republicans.
   The FEC rejected that argument on Tuesday when it released $46
million in federal campaign money for the Democratic ticket.

   Two Israeli border policemen were stoned and
two Gaza Strip residents were wounded as troops battled
demonstrators in the occupied territory on Thursday, the army said.
   Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israel seized an
Arab-owned house after the High Court of Justice ruled the army
could evict residents and set up a command post. The house sits on
the strategic Jerusalem-Hebron road.
   ``The military government said ... they must do something to
stop the throwing of stones,'' Ahmed Abuy Riad, who lived in the
house, told Israeli television. ``But the stones weren't thrown by
me .... I am innocent.''
   A military representative, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said violent protests broke out in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan
neighborhood on Thursday. Two military border policemen were hit by
rocks, and two Gazans were shot in the legs and slightly wounded,
the official said.
   Also Thursday, a Gaza man, 37-year-old Hadel Hafez el Toruk,
died after he was shot four times last Friday in Gaza City.
   The shooting occurred at the same time that soldiers fired at a
group of Arabs after one threw a firebomb in central Gaza City, the
army said.
   The military spokesman said the army was checking to see if
Toruk was shot by the troops.
   If so, he would be the 235th Palestinian killed in the
eight-month revolt against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, the territories captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War. Four Israelis have also been killed.
   In politics, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday
that he welcomed meetings between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy and Palestinians, as long as they do not belong to
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Murphy has said he wants to meet again with Palestinians in the
Middle East, something he had done in the past.
   The U.S. official is scheduled to travel to the Middle East from
Geneva during the first week in August for a peace mission that
will take him to Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
Thursday she was unaware of any concrete plans for Murphy to talk
to Palestinian leaders. She also said U.S. policy of refusing to
meet PLO leaders remained in place.
   Peres said he did not care if the Palestinians that might meet
with Murphy supported the PLO ideologically, as long as they were
not members. Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, calling it a
terrorist group.
   ``We do not censor ideas....'' Peres said. ``They should come
without rocks, without knives, without fire bombs.''

<HEAD>35 Percent Crop Damage Would Trigger Disaster Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producers of any commercial crop would be
eligible for disaster payments under drought aid legislation passed
by both houses Thursday if they lost more than 35 percent of their
1988 harvest due to drought.
   Under the House version, they also would be eligible if the
damage was caused by hail, floods or other natural disasters.
   Producers of crops covered by federal farm programs and those
that are not would be equally eligible for the payments, which
would equal 65 percent of their losses over the 35 percent
threshold.
   Growers whose crops were very severely damaged would be eligible
for supplemental payments. Under the House bill, this would amount
to an additional 30 percent of losses over 75 percent of expected
harvest. The Senate version would provide an additional 20 percent
of losses over 75 percent of the yield that farmers had anticipated.
   Under the House bill, farmers would be required to buy federal
crop insurance for the next two crop years to be eligible for
disaster payments.
   Livestock producers already eligible for existing government
feed programs and those in areas where USDA determines a feed
emergency exists would be eligible for a new program that begins 15
days after the measure becomes law.
   It would reimburse up to 50 percent of the cost of replacement
feed purchased during the emergency, allow sale of government-owned
feed at reduced rates, donate government feed to producers unable
to purchase it, pay up to 50 percent of some feed transportation
costs and provide up to half the cost of deepening wells and
certain other steps needed to water livestock.

   Showers and thunderstorms remained over Oklahoma and stretched
along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast states Thursday, while
the north-central states endured a day hot even for late July.
   Midday thunderstorms brought 1.37 inches of rain during a half
hour at Victoria, Mass., and winds gusted to nearly 60 mph at
Bedford, Mass. Winds reached 46 mph as 2\ inches of rain fell at
Wilmington, N.C.
   Early morning thunderstorms produced hail as large as golf balls
in central Oklahoma.
   Heavier rainfall during a six-hour period ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.37 inches at Victoria, Texas; almost an inch at Tulsa,
Okla., and three-quarters of an inch at Pensacola, Fla.
   The temperature at the Duluth, Minn., airport reached 95
degrees, breaking the record for the date of 92. The New Orleans
airport had a record low temperature for the date of 69 degrees
Thursday morning, one degree lower than the 70-degree mark set in
1984.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures around the nation ranged from 56
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 103 degrees at Needles, Calif.
The nation's low Thursday morning was 41 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Florida across southeast Louisiana and in central Colorado. Sunny
skies were forecast for the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 70s and 80s in New
England, the lower Great Lakes and the Appalachians, as well as the
upper Mississippi Valley, northern Plains, much of Washington state
and along the California coast. Highs should be in the 80s in much
of Colorado, northwest New Mexico and northern Arizona, and 100
degrees or more in north central Texas and southwest Oregon, with
about 110 degrees through the desert Southwest. High temperatures
over the rest of the nation should generally reach the 90s or near
90 degrees.

   The Iranian foreign minister will not meet
the Rev. Jesse Jackson to discuss the possible release of Americans
held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions, Iran's U.N.
ambassador said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
announced he would meet Friday with the wife of a kidnapped
American, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Higgins was abducted by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon in
February, and U.N. diplomats have reported hearing rumors recently
that he might be released.
   This week's peace talks between the secretary-general and envoys
from Iran and Iraq have brightened hopes for movement in gaining
the release of Western hostages in Lebanon. Perez de Cuellar said
he raised the issue Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati.
   However, Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said
Thursday that his country's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati,
was focusing on ending the Iran-Iraq war, not on releasing
hostages, while in New York.
   ``He doesn't have a mandate to embark on anything other than
implementation of the Security Council Resolution 598'' on a
cease-fire and peace plan to end the war, Mahallati said in answer
to questions.
   ``Indeed, not,'' Mahallati said when asked if Velayati would
meet Jackson.
   Earlier Thursday, Jackson telephoned Perez de Cuellar about the
hostages and asked him to convey a message to Velayati, U.N.
officials said. They said the secretary-general did so.
   But Mahallati said his mission had not yet received a
communication from Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I don't think the minister (Velayati) had intended in this
visit to make any effort in this line, and we don't have any
mandate to embark on any such discussion,'' Mahallati said.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters Wednesday night that he had
raised the problem of American hostages ``very, very specifically''
with Velayati during a meeting that day.
   ``I can confirm that the Rev. Jesse Jackson telephoned the
secretary-general early today about the fate of the American
hostages and asked that this message be conveyed to the foreign
minister of Iran,'' the secretary-general's spokesman, Francois
Giuliani, said in answer to reporters' questions.
   ``This was conveyed by the secretary-general to the foreign
minister.''
   Giuliani did not elaborate.
   Earlier Thursday, the Iranian Mission's counselor, Mohammad
Javad Zarif, said there had been no approach from the Jackson camp
and said, ``I do not think that there are any specific issues that
we'll have to talk about.''
   Jackson said Wednesday in Chicago that he had sought a meeting
with Velayati through the secretary-general to discuss obtaining
release of the American hostages.
   Iran has said it could intercede to obtain their freedom if the
United States agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in the United
States.
   The United States has said it is willing to discuss the issue
but has rejected any deal or payment of ransom.
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners being held hostage by
pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon. Longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
Anderson, 40, was abducted in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   The U.N Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution
Friday appealing for the release of Higgins, 43, kidnapped Feb. 17
on a highway in Lebanon, U.N. officials said. Higgins was chief of
the U.N. Troop Supervision Organization, a military observer group
in the Middle East.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters Thursday that he would meet
Robin Higgins, Higgins' wife, at U.N. headquarters at her request.

<TEXT>
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards minister,
Mohsen Rafiq- Doust, has been in a Tehran prison for the past three
weeks, the Beirut newspaper Ad-Diyar reported Thursday.
   The paper, based in Christian east Beirut, said the order for
his arrest was issued by Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful speaker
of Iran's Parliament who also became acting commander-in-chief of
Iranian armed forces on June 2.
   Ad-Diyar quoted unidentified ``informed sources'' as saying
Rafiq-Doust was arrested for ``refusing to cooperate with the armed
forces command and for squandering large sums of money.''
   The Revolutionary Guards corps is a paramilitary force composed
mainly of young fanatical supporters of revolutionary patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It was formed right after the
overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, with the task of
safeguarding the anti-royalist revolution.
   The Revolutionary Guards undertook a major frontline role after
the regular army failed to block the Iraqi advance early in the
Iran-Iraq war.

   A news leak on a covert plan to undermine
Panamanian military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega came from the
Reagan administration and was a ``set-up deal'' to make it look
like the disclosure came from Congress, leaders of the Senate
Intelligence Committee said Thursday.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the panel, and the
committee's ranking Republican, Sen. William Cohen of Maine, said
they believed the leak was a ``heavy-handed'' attempt to derail a
bill that would tighten congressional oversight of covert
operations, and also to enhance Vice President George Bush's
political prospects.
   ``I think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up
members of Congress to make them appear the source of the leak,''
said Cohen. ``I am offended by it.''
   ``I think the Intelligence Committee was used, in this case,''
added Boren.
   Boren said the whole matter had been handled in highly unusual
fashion, including a much wider dissemination than is normal for
information about presidential covert action authorizations, which
are known as ``findings.''
   ``I have a feeling it's much broader. More people than normal
knew,'' Boren said, possibly including members of Congress outside
the 15 senators and 17 House members who are on the intelligence
panels.
   ``If they've briefed other people, we can't be responsible for
that,'' said Cohen.
   Boren said reporters already were calling the Senate
Intelligence Committee and waiting outside its secure hearing room
on Tuesday even before the CIA briefing began. Cohen said he
expressed suspicions about the possibility of a leak before any
information was given in the briefing.
   In Panama, Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter on Thursday called
reports of the covert action plan ``intolerable'' and ``terrorist''
and said the Panamanian government would take a complaint to the
United Nations Security Council.
   ``It is intolerable and irritating that in the highest spheres
of power in the United States they talk of possible terrorist
actions in Panamanian territory,'' the government news agency
Panapres quoted Ritter as saying.
   He added that ``the Panamanian authorities are maintaining a
state of alert to reject any type of terrorist action.''
   On Wednesday, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times
reported that Reagan had signed a finding authorizing unspecified
covert activities aimed at undermining Noriega's rule. The military
ruler has clung to power for months despite previous U.S. efforts
to weaken the Panamanian economy, and U.S. inability to budge him
has become a political liability for the administration.
   Later reports said the covert action authorization included
support for the country's internal political opposition, but
stopped short of direct military or paramilitary action.
   Legislation is due to come to the House floor within the next
two weeks which would require notification of the House and Senate
intelligence committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan
signed by the president.
   The measure, prompted by last year's Iran-Contra investigation,
is designed to tighten current law, which requires only that
unspecified ``timely notice'' be given to Congressional overseers.
   The administration strongly opposes the bill, calling it a
strait jacket on the president's ability to conduct intelligence
operations and arguing that in cases of extremely sensitive covert
acts the White House must be free to withhold notification from
Congress.
   Boren said he did not believe the administration action would
have any significant impact on future U.S. policy decisions, and
added that Noriega would be unaffected by any threat from the
United States.
   ``Noriega doesn't put much stock in words,'' said Boren. ``I
think it's time we went back to Teddy Roosevelt's admonition. We've
talked loudly and carried a small stick ... I don't think hurling
more words at him is going to work.''

   Black parents and students are
boycotting white businesses in a campaign to oust the white
superintendent of the mostly black school district.
   The controversy began in the spring when 87 of the system's
9,200 students failed a new standardized test needed to pass to the
next grade.
   Willie Long, who heads the protest for the group, called Save
Our Children, said the test issue is now a ``dead horse.'' He said,
however, that the test encouraged parents to join the protest as
their anger grew.
   Protesters said Wednesday they would expand their action to
pressure the Greenville Public Schools Board of Trustees to fire
Superintendent Nolan Vickers and his assistant, Janet Sweatt, who
also is white.
   Protesters accuse Vickers and Sweatt of being insensitive to the
needs of blacks, who comprise more than 90 percent of the school
system's students.
   Vickers and Sweatt were in meetings Thursday and unavailable for
comment, said Assistant Superintendent Arthur Peyton, who is black.
   When asked if he has any problems with the current school
administration, Peyton replied, ``No I don't because I'm
instrumental in running it. In the things that are coming out, I'm
as much responsible for it as anyone else.''
   School Board President Mary Haynes, who is black, declined to
comment on the boycott, but said board members probably would
discuss it at their Aug. 11 meeting.
   Parents and students marched Wednesday in groups as small as
four and as large as eight in front of department stores, a
shopping mall, two fast-food restaurants and a car dealership.
   ``We're definitely making an impact,'' said Long, who teaches
biology in the school district. ``Our being out here is against the
will of the white business community.''

   Negotiators for scriptwriters and television
and film producers agreed to resume contract talks Friday to try to
end the 21-week walkout that has idled Hollywood production, a
federal mediator said Thursday.
   Floyd Wood, district director for the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, asked negotiators to return to the bargaining
table Friday afternoon. Both sides stated that they would comply,
Wood said.
   Negotiations between the Writers Guild of America and the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke off
Tuesday morning after a marathon 20-hour baragaining session failed
to produce a settlement.
   In a strike-related development, NBC announced Thursday that it
will bring back ``The Magical World of Disney,'' which the network
recently removed from the fall schedule because of the strike.
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff had previously
announced that the writers' strike would keep the Disney program
off the Sunday schedule this fall. The network had planned to
replace ``The Magical World of Disney'' with a recast version of
``The Hardy Boys,'' using old scripts.
   ``The Hardy Boys'' will now move to another weeknight.
   The Disney series, set to debut Oct. 9, will be filled with
feature films, old Disney specials and compilation programs until
an end to the writer's strike provides original programming.
   The union has been on strike since March 7. Issues in the
impasse are payments for reruns of one-hour television shows
rebroadcast domestically and all shows rebroadcast overseas.

   Nearly all of Atlanta was without water for
several hours Thursday night after a boiler that generates steam to
run municipal pumps failed.
   The boiler shut down at 5:15 p.m. and was repaired about 6:45
p.m., said Rob Rivers, head of the water department.
   ``We have to raise the pressure very, very slowly, or we'll
cause tremendous problems, water mains bursting everywhere,''
Rivers said.
   He said the major boiler, which produces steam to power the
water pumps, ``suffered either an electrical or mechanical failure
and shut down,'' Rivers said. ``Pressure went from 120 pounds (per
square inch) to 40 pounds.''
   The problem, which he blamed on outdated equipment, extended to
``most everyone inside the city,'' Rivers said, especially those at
higher elevations.

   A Danish actor who caused a
disturbance on a trans-Atlantic flight after sneaking a smoke in
the washroom pleaded guilty to a charge of mischief Thursday and
was sentenced to 90 days in jail.
   Ole Svane Thestrup, 41, of Copenhagen was on a British Airways

smoke alarm in the washroom of a Boeing 747.
   Defense lawyer Mark O'Neill said the sentence will not be
appealed.
   The crown prosecutor did not proceed with charges of endangering
an aircraft and assaulting a peace officer.
   Police said earlier that Thestrup tussled with the crew, tried
to open the airplane's door, and threw a drink in the pilot's face
after he was caught smoking during the flight Tuesday.
   The pilot made an unscheduled landing in Winnipeg, where
Thestrup was handed over to police.

   Bodies found in a charred home have been
identified as those of child actress Judith Barsi, who died at the
hands of her actor father in the movie ``Fatal Vision,'' and her
mother, the coroner's office said Thursday.
   A man's body found in the house after the fire Wednesday
previously was identified as the child's father, Jozsef, 55, who
apparently shot his wife and child to death, set the family home
afire and then killed himself.
   The bodies of Judith, 11, and her mother, Maria, 48, were
positively identified at the scene by physical characteristics,
said coroner's investigator Michael Riddle.
   The family's nearest relatives were in Arizona and no funeral
arrangements had been made, he said.
   Miss Barsi made her film debut in 1987 in ``Jaws IV: The
Revenge,'' in which she played the role of Thea.
   Her television appearances included roles in ``St. Elsewhere,''
``Cagney and Lacey'' and ``Growing Pains,'' said Bonnie Gold, a
spokeswoman for an acting agency that managed her career.
   She also played convicted killer Jeffrey MacDonald's daughter in
the movie ``Fatal Vision.'' She, her sister and pregnant mother
were killed in the movie, which was based on a true story.
   Neighbors said Barsi was an overprotective father and abusive
husband who had threatened to kill his 48-year-old wife and burn
their home.
   Next door neighbor Eunice Daly said Mrs. Barsi told her last
week that her husband became abusive and threatening when he drank.
She said Mrs. Barsi told her she was considering divorce but was
afraid to move out.
   ``She said, `I can't because he'll come after us and kill us and
he's threatened to burn the house down,''' Ms. Daly said.
   Mrs. Barsi said she planned to cash her daughter's $12,000
federal tax refund check that day, before her husband could get it,
the neighbor said.
   The child's body was found in her bed and the woman's in a
hallway, police Lt. Warren Knowles said. He said both had been shot
once in the head.
   ``The child was not allowed to go anywhere, very few places
alone,'' neighbor Linda Williams said. ``Even when she came to our
home, it always had to be OK'd by Dad.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Welcomes Koch's Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of
Commons on Thursday that she welcomed New York City Mayor Ed Koch's
change of heart on the subject of Northern Ireland.
   Koch completed a six-day tour of Northern Ireland and returned
to New York, where on Wednesday he publicly disavowed his earlier
opinions about the British stance on the troubled province. Koch
said he accepted the British army as a peacekeeping force rather
than an occupying army.
   Mrs. Thatcher told members of Parliament in the elected lower
chamber: ``If more people came with an open mind and looked at what
is happening on the ground, we would have many others making
similar remarks.''
   ``I admire Mr. Koch's forthrightness and I am glad he took time
to come to Northern Ireland,'' she added.
   In Belfast, Koch was described as one of the few American
politicians of stature who have had anything positive to say about
Britain's role in Northern Ireland.
   ``His comments after his factfinding visit to Ireland are as
refreshing as they are surprising'' the Belfast Telegraph, Northern
Ireland's independent evening newspaper, commented editorially on
Thursday.
   ``Compare his statement `My impression is that the British are
trying to play a constructive role' with the attack launched by
Congressman Joe Kennedy after his visit earlier this year'' the
newspaper said, refering to the Democratic U.S. representative from
Massachusetts.
   ``Mr. Koch has shown an attitude uncommon in American
politicians when dealing with the Irish problem _ a willingness to
view the situation with an open mind.
   ``He is also honest enough to admit that his vision of Ulster
from across the Atlantic did not square up with what he found here:
`I do not believe that they (the British) deserve the castigation
that many of us, myself included, have heaped upon them,''' the
Belfast Telegraph quoted Koch as saying.
   ``Too many people in the international community mistake the
myths and propaganda emanating from these shores for facts and
believe a British withdrawal is the simplistic solution to all our
ills. Mayor Koch realizes the problems are much more complex than
other `green-tinted' visionaries understand,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Of course, the hardline Irish-American lobbyists will attempt
to make political capital from his comments but those Americans who
are willing to listen will learn much more about the reality of
life in Ireland today from Mayor Koch.
   ``They should, as must the people of Ulster, learn that
harboring grievances for past errors or wrongs will not further the
quest for peace here,'' the newspaper said. ``There have been
historical mistakes in Ireland, on all sides, but acknowledgment
should also be given, as Mayor Koch does, for the positive
contributions made in areas like housing, jobs and electoral
representation. We can build on gains not divisions.''

   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada
saluted a convoy of U.S. veterans that is bringing food, medicine
and clothes to the capital with a banner headline Thursday reading,
``Veterans Break Boycott.''
   The Veterans' Peace Convoy was expected in Managua Friday and
would turn over the supplies to the government at a ceremony at the
Revolution Plaza downtown.
   Barricada said thousands of people greeted the convoy of 20
vehicles and 44 activists when it crossed the Honduran-Nicaraguan
border Wednesday after months of opposition from the U.S.
government.
   The U.S. Customs Service initially refused to let the convoy
cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying taking the vehicles to
Nicaragua would violate a 1985 trade embargo.
   Humanitarian aid is permitted under the embargo, but the Customs
Service says the vehicles must return to the United States.
   The convoy people oppose U.S. backing of the rebels, known as
Contras, in their almost 7-year-old war against Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   Barricada said U.S. police ``brutally repressed'' the group in
its attempt to bring ``medicine, food and clothes for Nicaraguan
children butchered by the war action of the Reagan administration.''
   Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a Rio Grande
bridge crossing in Laredo, Texas. The convoy finally crossed the
Mexican border at Nuevo Laredo on July 14.
   The Customs Service said the trucks must return to the United
States within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of up to
$50,000 and 10 years in prison. Convoy members refused to sign
forms promising they would return the trucks.
   In June, U.S. Customs officials stopped the original convoy of
38 vehicles from crossing into Mexico. About 100 convoy
participants drove to Washington to rally against Customs'
decision, circling around the White House and in front of the State
Department in three days of protest.

   U.S. military experts left the Persian
Gulf on Thursday after a 3{-week investigation of the destruction
of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, Navy officials said.
   The team led by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two
days after missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes hit an Iran
Air Airbus flying over the Strait of Hormuz, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   Pentagon officials said officers of the Vincennes mistook the
Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
   Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before
leaving.
   The U.S. Navy officials said the report would ``work its way up
the chain of command'' to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. Because
Carlucci is in the Soviet Union until about Aug. 8, they said, the
report could not be released until mid-August.
   Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes
and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS
Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides.
   They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and other officers of the
three warships.
   An initial 15-day deadline for the investigation was extended at
Fogarty's request.
   The Navy officials would not give details of the investigations
and said contact with Iran for information would have to be through
diplomatic channels. The Vincennes has been assigned to the Arabian
Sea, just outside the Persian Gulf, and is expected to complete its
tour at the end of summer.
   In Ottawa, Iranian diplomat Gholamreza Behtashi said a
five-member team from the International Civil Aviation Organization
is expected to arrive Friday in Tehran, Iran's capital, to pursue
its own investigation into the disaster.
   Behtashi, third secretary at the Iranian Embassy, said the team
is made up of technical personnel from the Montreal-based United
Nations agency.
   ``They will go from Tehran to the Persian Gulf and investigate
the various aspects of the incident,'' Behtashi said.
   Iran asked the governing council of the agency to meet in
special session to condemn the attack, but members refused to
censure the United States.
   The 33-nation governing council ordered the inquiry on July 14.
   U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the
investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had not
asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a visit
would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf.
   ICAO is a technical body composed of 159 nations. It sets
standards for civil aviation and airline safety.

<HEAD>`Road,' A Play By Jim Cartwright, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Road,'' a gritty, grimy and thoroughly
fascinating journey through industrial England, puts most of the
audience where the action is _ right in the middle of an unnamed
Lancashire town dying during Margaret Thatcher's boom times.
   This provocative play, which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's
La Mama Annex, lets theatergoers wander a dismal thoroughfare and
mingle with the town's citizens. The less adventurous can perch
along a three-sided balcony and observe the action, but the
distance would seem to dilute the drama.
   To get the full effect of Simon Curtis' masterful direction,
it's better to be right down on the road, a depressingly realistic
environment designed by Paul Brown. Curtis does a remarkable job,
not only with the actors but with the audience which follows the
flow of the play across the playing area with minimal instruction
from the performers.
   The setting reflects the dead-end dreams of its inhabitants. The
hulk of an abandoned car sits on one corner of the playing area.
Squat, dilapidated homes line one side of the street. Other open
spaces become the oppressive parlors and bedrooms of these people
who have lost all hope.
   Playwright Jim Cartwright has written some bitter yet often very
funny vignettes about their threadbare existence and stitched them
together by creating a scruffy master of ceremonies named Scullery.
The character is played with a roguish charm by Jack Wallace.
   Scullery introduces the residents of the road, all of them in
the process of going out for the evening. ``Going out'' for most of
them means getting drunk.
   Several of the scenes are etched in despair. Audiences meet the
middle-aged Jerry who, in a poignant soliloquy, laments the days
long ago when people had jobs, good times and felt ``safe.''
   ``I can't get away from the past,'' he says. ``But no matter
what they say, I can't see how that time could turn into this
time.''
   The hopelessness of today is reiterated throughout the play and
Cartwright offers several variations on that desolation. In another
sketch, a young man named Joey is on a hunger strike. ``They rush
you from the cradle to the grave. But now we've come to a
standstill, no job, no hope,'' he murmurs to his good-natured
girlfriend who joins him in the starvation pact.
   There's also a defiance in the desperation, particularly in the
play's powerful last scene when two young men pick up two girls and
bring them home for booze and sex. The quartet is moved by Otis
Redding's recording of ``Try a Little Tenderness,'' and as they
become progressively drunker, they chant fiercely, ``Somehow _
might escape.'' You get the impression that if they don't,
something terrible is going to happen.
   Cartwright's play is overtly political and his message
occasionally becomes heavy-handed. There are references to Thatcher
and what kind of country England has become under Conservative
Party rule. But his characters are immensely human _ often
humorous, often repugnant and completely believable.
   The play's seven actors portray a variety of characters and
their versatility is a marvel. Kevin Bacon gets the most difficult
workout. He must switch from the impassioned hunger striker to a
drunkenly catatonic soldier. As the striker's simple-minded
girlfriend, Joan Cusack projects a delicacy that shines through all
the despair. She radiates a sweetness that is captivating.
   Equally fine work comes from Gerry Bamman as the nostaglic
Jerry; Betsy Aidem as an old hag trying to get dressed to go out
for an evening of fun; Michael Wincott, an unnerving and menacing
Skinhead, and Jayne Haynes as a sassy tart.
   ``Road'' is a joint production of Lincoln Center Theater and La
Mama. For Lincoln Center, it is another feather in an already
crowded cap of shows that includes ``Anything Goes,'' ``Sarafina!''
and ``Speed-the-Plow.''

   War enemies Iran and Iraq traded
recriminations during a one-day suspension of U.N. peace talks
Thursday. The talks at an impasse over Iraq's insistence on direct
talks and Iran's reluctance to agree.
   However, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the
impasse did not mean peace talks were collapsing. He said he was
working on a formula for breaking the disagreement.
   Iraq demands a face-to-face meeting before a truce and Iran
insists on a truce before it will consider a direct meeting at a
later stage.
   Iran accused Iraq Thursday of stalling, sabotaging U.N. peace
talks and blocking a truce in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Pressure was increasing on Iraq in the 15-member Security
Council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that
could prolong the fighting, according to U.N. diplomats, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign ministers Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran did not visit U.N. headquarters Thursday after Perez de
Cuellar called a one-day suspension in his revolving-door diplomacy
aimed at ending the war.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told reporters who
asked about direct talks, ``We will maintain our position. We will
not accept any preconditions (for direct talks). No step can be
taken before a cease-fire ...
   ``Accepting (U.N. cease-fire) Resolution 598 has been the last
flexibility by the Islamic Republic of Iran.''
   Perez de Cuellar said he hoped Iranian officials ``are
reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some
stage,'' but said he cannot compel the two sides to do so if Iran
is unwilling.
   Later Thursday, he assumed a more positive tone, assuring
reporters that talks were still under way.
   ``I reject the idea of any collapse absolutely. I reject it
emphatically. I have to keep waiting,'' Perez de Cuellar said,
adding he believed ``at some stage, direct talks are
indispensable.''
   He acknowleded there was an impasse and, when asked if he had a
formula for breaking it, said: ``I'm working on that.''
   Also Thursday, Perez de Cuellar announced he would meet Friday
with the wife of an American U.N. official kidnapped in Lebanon
last Feb. 17, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. He said he would
meet Robin Higgins, Higgins' wife, at U.N. headquarters at her
request.
   The Iraqi Mission insisted that ``given the Iranian duplicity
and bad faith, peace can only be achieved through direct
face-to-face negotiations'' under U.N. auspices. It said that
Iraq's goal was lasting peace and not just a cease-fire.
   The deadlock over direct negotiations has complicated U.N.
efforts to end the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Fighting continued Thursday, with Iran saying it crushed an
Iraqi force in two days of fighting around the western Iranian city
of Eslamabad, 60 miles from the Iraqi border.
   Perez de Cuellar suspended talks for a day to study his
exchanges with the Iraqi and Iranian envoys since Tuesday. Meetings
were to resume Friday.
   Mohammad Javad Zarif, counselor at Iran's U.N. Mission, told
reporters direct talks would not promote peace at this time.
   He commented one day after Velayati accepted all of Perez de
Cuellar's proposals on implementing the resolution's peace plan.
   Iraq has not yet responded.
   Details of the proposals have not been disclosed.
   On Wednesday, Aziz said Baghdad insists on direct talks with
Iran before a cease-fire and will not be ``stampeded'' into a truce
without guarantees from Iran.
   The Iraqi Mission accused Iran on Thursday of ``a malicious
campaign to sow confusion in diplomatic efforts to achieve peace by
flooding the U.N. and media with statements alleging that Iraq is
fighting inside Iran.''
   The mission said Iraq's recent military operations were carried
out ``to liberate remnants of occupied Iraqi territories.'' It said
troops only entered Iranian territory to liberate Iraqi land, and
added: ``Iraqi forces have long since withdrawn. Iraq has no
territorial ambitions inside Iran.''
   Iraq accused Iran of ``simply seeking a hasty truce without
giving any commitments that it will comply honestly and sincerely
to the full implementation of the resolution as a plan for
comprehensive and durable peace.''
   ``The policy of Iraq is to put obstacles in the way of the
secretary-general's peace efforts,'' Iran's Zarif said. ``This
whole Iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the efforts upon which
the international community is looking with hope.''
   The U.N. chief summoned both foreign ministers to New York this
week for intensive consultations on setting a timetable for a
U.N.-supervised cease-fire, a troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange,
formal peace negotiations and creating a panel to determine which
side started the war, all points contained in the Security Council
resolution.

<TEXT>
   British Airways said Thursday it grounded the most
senior pilot of its supersonic Concorde jetliner division for the
rest of his career because he broke company rules about fuel levels
during a flight from New York to London in May.
   The airline said in a statement that it banned Capt. Brian
Walpole, 54, from flying and confined him to his desk job as
general manager of the Concorde division until he retires on his
55th birthday in December.
   Queen Elizabeth II had honored Walpole just this year on the
advice of the government by making him an officer of the Order of
the British Empire.
   British Airways said the Concorde that Walpole had been flying
developed an hydraulic fault, forcing him to reduce speed and so
use more fuel than normal.
   But it said that despite having the option of stopping at
Shannon airport in Ireland to take on more fuel, he flew on to
London's Heathrow airport.
   It said air traffic controllers at Heathrow responded to a
request to clear the Concorde for a priority landing. The plane was
found to have enough fuel for 25 more minutes flying instead of the
minimum 30 required by British Airways rules.
   ``A rule had been broken. Capt. Walpole has ceased flying duties
and will carry on his managerial duties as general manager of the
Concorde division until his time (for retirement) comes,'' the
statement said.
   It said the 49 passengers on the flight were not endangered.
   Walpole was the first pilot to fly Concorde across the Atlantic
to New York on its inaugural supersonic flight from London, in
1977, after helping test-fly the plane.
   In 1985, he flew Queen Mother Elizabeth in a Concorde as a treat
for her 85th birthday.

   Federal officials who have taken over an
abandoned chemical plant in which a roof collapsed on already
leaking drums warned worried residents Thursday night that they may
face an emergency.
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesmen told about 300
residents who crowded into a school auditorium for a town meeting
that the agency does not know what is in more than 1,000 decaying
drums at Artel Chemical Co.
   ``So the bottom line is, we're in danger?'' asked one woman in
the audience after the two-hour question-and-answer session.
   ``We wouldn't be there if you weren't,'' answered Dr. Joseph
Lafornara, with the EPA's Environmental Response Team from Edison,
N.J.
   ``But the hazard has been there for years. You've been living
with it. What we're saying is, in three or four months, it won't be
there anymore.''
   Lafornara characterized the site as one of the three most
critical among hundreds he has worked with under the federal
Superfund program, which draws money from the chemical industry to
help clean up hazardous dump sites.
   EPA spokesman Harold Yates said the plant had a long history of
``legal maneuvering'' and safety violations. He said the plant
manufactured ``small batches of exotic chemicals'' that cleanup
workers now are having trouble identifying.
   Former Artel employees attacked the EPA for not hiring them to
identify substances in the unmarked chemical drums, while some
residents harshly criticized the EPA for not stepping in years ago.
   Yates said the most pressing problems at the closed plant
include at least 60 drums of highly volatile metallic sodium and a
large tank containing 9,000 gallons of methyl mercaptan, a chemical
that is mixed in with natural gas to give it an odor.
   Yates said the threat of a ``severe explosion'' had been created
over the weekend when rain triggered a roof collapse at the plant's
main warehouse.
   ``There are drums that are rupturing as we speak,'' he had said
Wednesday. ``We're talking about a major accident that could happen
there.''
   But Yates said Thursday an engineer determined that the building
was structurally safe, and Kanawha County Emergency Services
Coordinator Bill White played down the danger.
   ``I do not think the potential is any greater than it has been
in the last five years,'' White said. ``The roof's been leaking for
years. The barrels have been leaking for years.''
   White said the EPA told him that Saturday's roof fall had
punctured several barrels of acid and that water or moisture had
reacted with the chemicals ``and they started fuming.''
   But he said there was little environmental danger.
   The Artel plant is one of several chemical plants along a strech
of Kanawha Valley in western West Virginia. Nitro, with about 8,000
residents, is about 12 miles west of Charleston.
   The plant has been closed since 24 employees walked off the job
June 6 in a pay dispute. They contended that they were being paid
below minimum wage. Operations then were shut down after the U.S.
Department of Labor obtained a federal court injunction against
Artel.
   The EPA has stepped in to clean up the unidentified chemicals at
Artel, and an Ohio company is finishing the first step of taking
test samples from the containers.
   White said the chemicals will be moved for disposal, increasing
the risk of spills and leaks at that time.
   The plant was owned and operated as Fike Chemical Co. for about
25 years by Elmer Fike, who was retained as a minority owner and
consultant by Artel when he sold the plant in 1986.
   Fike could not be reached at home Thursday and former plant
manager Tom Beal, Fike's son-in-law, was out of town, a family
member said.

   James Messer Jr. was executed in Georgia's
electric chair Thursday night for beating and stabbing his his
8-year-old niece to death when she fought his attempts to molest
her.
   Messer, 34, was pronounced dead at 7:23 p.m. Thursday, said
Department of Corrections spokesman John Siler.
   Warden Walter Zant asked Messer if he had any final words, and
he said he did not. Messer did ask for a prayer, and prison
Chaplain Nolan Lavelle placed his hands on Messer's left forearm
and gave about a one-minute prayer. At the conclusion, Messer said,
``Amen.''
   Fourteen people witnessed the execution, including one of
Messer's attorneys. Messer did not ask for any personal witnesses
to the execution, Siler said. His mother, Mary Messer, and an aunt
visited him at the prison Wednesday.
   Outside the prison, 12 death penalty protesters sang, while
about 20 pro-death penalty demonstrators, including one man wearing
a white Ku Klux Klan robe, carried signs in favor of the execution.
   The execution came just over an hour after the U.S. Supreme
Court, in a 7-2 vote, refused to halt it. Justices Thurgood
Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented, but there was no
immediate elaboration from the court.
   The Supreme Court order followed a similar action Thursday by
the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, which had been asked to
commute Messer's death sentence to life in prison. Chairman Wayne
Snow said the panel concluded ``there are insufficient grounds for
further consideration'' of the commutation request.
   Snow said the board rejected a psychiatrist's testimony that
Messer's ``explosive'' behavior may have been caused by brain
damage.
   Messer was convicted of the Feb. 13, 1979, slaying of Rhonda
Joan Tanner. Prosecutors said he abducted her from her school in
Cedartown, tried to molest her and then killed her when she fought
him.
   Her parents, Wayne and Joyce Tanner of Cedartown, came to the
prison Thursday with 28 friends and neighbors carrying signs with
slogans like ``Ten Years Too Long'' and ``Tanner Family Finally
Gets Justice.''
   After the execution, Tanner, 47, tearfully said the death was
``a big relief. He finally paid.''
   ``We feel we can finally put our baby to rest,'' said Mrs.
Tanner, 45.
   Messer was the 13th person executed in Georgia's electric chair
since the state resumed executions in 1983. He was the 101st person
put to death in the United States since the Supreme Court allowed
states to retore capital punishment in 1976.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Hall of Atlanta rejected Messer's
appeal for a stay Wednesday, and the Georgia Supreme Court denied a
stay Monday.
   Messer was sentenced to death in 1980. Prosecutors said he
abducted his niece after telling school officials her father had
been hurt.
   The girl's body, clad in a shirt, was found the next day.
Testimony in Messer's trial showed he had led her into the woods
and tried to molest her. When she resisted, he kicked her, slashed
her stomach five times, beat and stabbed her, then left her to die.
   Messer's lawyers contended their client was mentally incompetent
and thus, under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, could not be put to
death. The attorneys also have argued that Messer's civil rights
were violated when state prison officials refused to allow
neurological tests for a possible brain tumor.
   Messer came within 15 hours of execution two years ago, but won
a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. The case later went back to the
Circuit Court, which voted 7-5 to uphold the death sentence.

<HEAD>White House Says Drought Relief Could Trigger Broad Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: To update with congressional drought relief action, SUBS 5th

<TEXT>
   The administration on Thursday projected the
federal deficit for the upcoming budget year at $140.1 billion _
short of the trigger for across-the-board spending cuts _ but
warned that a hefty drought-relief bill could cause the automatic
reductions to kick in.
   The new deficit estimate, covering the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1, is $5.9 billion below the $146 billion level that would
force politically painful cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
   However, James Miller, head of the Office of Management and
Budget, said that the drought relief bill and several other
spending proposals could quickly wipe out the cushion and trigger
the spending cuts, which would take effect right before the
November elections.
   Miller said that President Reagan supports drought relief, a
popular initiative in an election year, but he said the president
doesn't want to ``use the plight of the farmers as an opportunity
to make a Christmas tree out of that bill'' by loading it up with
provisions that have little to do with drought relief.
   Later Thursday, the House approved a drought bill providing up
to $5.8 billion in assistance for farmers, while the Senate passed
a drought relief measure estimated to cost between $5.85 billion
and $6.55 billion.
   The administration is also fighting to hold down spending on
other measures pending before Congress, including anti-drug
legislation, trade legislation and aid for the hungry and homeless.
   Miller said if all of those measures were adopted, the 1989
deficit would increase by between $6.4 billion and $8.7 billion,
enough even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the spending
cuts.
   ``We can't do all the things that Congress has on its list right
now,'' he told reporters during a White House briefing. ``Congress
has got to pare down and make sure it doesn't go over these
limits.''
   House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., agreed
that the administration's mid-session budget review showed ``we may
be moving uncomfortably close'' to automatic spending cuts.
   ``It is clear from this report that Congress and the
administration will have to make difficult choices in the months
ahead. All of the urgent needs of the nation cannot be funded at
the levels most of us would support in less difficult times,'' Gray
said.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman act, the administration is required to
estimate the coming year's fiscal budget deficit by mid-August. The
White House budget office must then adjust that estimate in October
to take into account any new legislation.
   If such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount
of $146 billion, automatic spending cuts of more than $10 billion
automatically take effect in October, right before the fall
elections, with half of the cuts taken out of domestic spending and
half out of military spending.
   The administration's new budget estimates, which are based on
updated economic and spending projections, predicted that the
deficit in the current fiscal year would be $152.3 billion.
   This is slightly higher than the $146.7 billion deficit estimate
the administration made in February, but it is still well below the
deficit estimates of $160 billion or more that were being made by
many private economists at the time.
   Better-than-expected economic growth, which has pushed the
unemployment rate down to a 14-year-low and boosted government tax
revenues, was credited for lowering the shortfall.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a private
consulting firm, said his current estimates were close to the
administration's forecasts for this year and next year.
   The 1987 budget deficit was $150.4 billion as a one-time
windfall from tax overhaul resulted in a big improvement from the
$221.1 billion record deficit suffered in 1986.
   Miller, noting that the administration's original forecast was
scorned as a ``rosy scenario,'' blamed higher spending in such
areas as deposit insurance for missing the administration's
February target.
   The budget review said that the bank and savings and loan
insurance funds would pay out $4.6 billion more this year than had
been originally budgeted because of high failure rates at financial
institutions in the depressed Southwest.
   The deficit target under the Gramm-Rudman legislation for the
upcoming fiscal year is $136 billion, but the legislation says
automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the government's deficit
projection is within $10 billion of that figure. Thus, for 1989,
any estimate below $146 billion would avoid the need for spending
cuts.

<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arson forest fire that has burned
into the western edges of this city expanded and switched direction
Thursday and more subdivisions were ordered evacuated, officials
said.
   ``It's out of control. It has expanded drastically since I was
there last evening,'' Gov. George Mickelson said.
   In Wyoming, efforts to block a fire burning toward Old Faithful
geyser in Yellowstone National Park were hampered by what normally
would be good firefighting weather _ cool, damp conditions slowed a
backfire intended to head off one of seven major fires.
   Fires also burned in Alaska, Montana, Idaho, California, Utah
and Washington state.
   Three subdivisions in western Rapid City were ordered evacuated
Thursday as a precaution as wind whipped a fire in the heavily
forested Black Hills. Later Thursday, officials suggested that
residents leave another rural housing area.
   Reports that the fire was arson brought strong reaction from
residents.
   ``I can't believe there's people that sick,'' said Susan Van
Norton, who couldn't return home after a dental appointment because
of the evacuation order. ``It floors me to think that someone could
cause that much destruction and devastaton to so many people.
   Fire officials did not know how many homes were involved but
said the number was in the hundreds.
   ``It's almost being defended totally by air at the present time
because it is in those canyons and the ground crews simply cannot
fight the fire,'' Mickelson said in an interview from his office in
Pierre.
   The wind switched from the southeast to the north during the
morning and gained speed, he said. That combined with a forecast
high of 100 degrees ``does not bode well for fighting the fire,''
the governor said.
   The fire had been declared 70 percent contained by late Thursday
after burning an estimated 2,800 acres. Fifteen homes, 32
outbuildings, 14 vehicles and a bridge had been destroyed.
   Earlier Thursday, about half of the 1,000 people who were told
to leave their homes Wednesday were allowed to return.
   Mickelson was at the scene Wednesday and saw a barn and a house
catch fire no more than 200 yards away. The buildings were engulfed
in seconds.
   Don Kopp, the fire incident commander, said Wednesday that the
fire was the work of an arsonist. And he said authorities have been
investigating a series of about 50 fires dating back to May that
are believed to have been started by the same person.
   A 14-year-old boy was arrested in Rapid City after a small fire
was reported on a ridge overlooking the town. But police said they
did not think he was responsible for setting the main fire on
Tuesday.
   Fires inside Yellowstone had charred 95,135 acres by Thursday
evening, about 4 percent of the park's 2.2 million acres.
   Although cooler temperatures, higher humidity and scattered
showers aided fire control efforts, the conditions created problems
for firefighters attempting to start a 6-mile backfire along the
eastern edge of the 8,500-acre North Fork fire that was within six
miles of Old Faithful.
   But the same conditions helped firefighters outside the park and
officials in the Bridger-Teton National Forest prepared to release
some of the 690 firefighters battling the 24,400-acre Mink Creek
fire in the forest's Teton Wilderness, said Ed Waldapfel, fire
information officer.
   The seven major fires in the park have not discouraged tourists
from visiting the famous Old Faithful geyser, as hundreds have been
gathering to watch its regular eruptions.
   Officials continued to stress Thursday that the Old Faithful
complex around the geyser was in no danger from the fire. The
complex consists of three lodges providing 521 rooms, including the
Old Faithful Inn, which is on the U.S. Department of Interior's
list of national historic landmarks. Other services at Old Faithful
include a general store and two service stations.
   Controversy continued over the National Park Service's so-called
``let it burn'' philosophy. The Park Service prefers its action to
be called fire management, saying fires are a natural part of a
healthy forest.
   Park naturalist ranger Don Buss said the last time the park
burned ``very badly was back in the 1600s.''
   Tons of fallen timber, fast-growing brush, trees killed by pine
beetle and nearly 100 years of fire suppression have kept an
elderly forest intact as a likely fire victim, park officials said.
   ``A forest that is 200-to-300-years old is more or less
preparing its own funeral pyre,'' said John Varley, a park
scientist.
   Five more families left their homes early Thursday in western
Montana when the Madison Gulch fire grew to about 900 acres in the
Lolo National Forest. About 50 people left their homes in the area
Wednesday as a precaution from areas near Alberton, a town of 300
on the Clark Fork River about 35 miles west of Missoula.
   There were 51 wind-whipped fires burning across Alaska;
firefighters were battling only 16 of them. Bureau of Land
Management spokesman Bill Rockwell said fires this summer have
blackened 1.4 million acres in Alaska.
   Ten families remained out of their homes in the area of the
3,000-acre Willis Gulch fire northeast of Boise, Idaho, and the
state imposed strict fire restrictions, due to go into effect at
midnight, on government land throughout the dry southern part of
the state.
   In California, firefighters were working on scores of small
fires throughout the Sierra Nevada, most of them caused by
lightning. But a fire that burned about 30 acres Wednesday near
Coulterville, destroying four structures and forcing the evacuation
of up to 70 homes, was blamed on a careless 13-year-old smoker.

<HEAD>Kim Presses For Talks With South, Co-Hosting Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung called on South
Korea Thursday to agree to his proposal for legislators from the
two rivals to meet at the earliest date, and renewed the North's
demand to co-host the Olympic Games.
   In a banquet speech for visiting Ethiopian President Mengistu
Haile-Mariam, Kim also denounced U.S. plans to reinforce its
military presence in and around South Korea during the Sept.
17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul, the communist North's official Korean
Central News Agency reported.
   The KCNA English-language report, monitored in Tokyo, was
transmitted late Thursday night. No immediate reaction came from
South Korean officials.
   Last week, North Korea proposed that legislators from the two
Koreas meet in Pyongyang, the North's capital, to discuss a
non-agression pact. In a second letter Tuesday, it said it was
ready to consider ending its boycott and entering the Olympics if
the South would consider its demand to act as host at the Games.
   South Korean officials have said they were studying the letters
and would respond ``affirmatively,'' but they want to meet in the
truce village of Panmunjon in the Demilitarized Zone that divides
the two Koreas.
   Said Kim: ``These days, the United States is reinforcing massive
armed forces in and around South Korea on the plea of guaranteeing
`Olympic safety,' and at the instigation of the United States, the
South Korean authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever
to keep our nation divided forever.
   ``What is needed ... is a dialogue for great national unity and
reunification ... and the co-hosting of the Olympics,'' Kim said.
   The International Olympic Committee has rejected North Korea's
demand to act as co-host at the Games, saying they are awarded to
only one city.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North and
pro-West, capitalist South in 1945 at the end of World War II. The
two halves fought the bloody Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and
remain bitter rivals.
   Kim added without elaborating that ``the standing committee of
our Supreme People's Assembly has decided to send a letter of
proposal to the U.S. Congress for negotiations.''
   It was this assembly, North Korea's rubberstamp parliament, that
sent the two letters to South Korea's National Assembly through
Panmunjon.
   Kim noted that Marxist Ethiopia has ``taken the same stand with
us in the struggle to realize Olympic co-hosting.''
   Cuba, Albania, Nicaragua and the Seychelles also are boycotting
the Games, but 161 nations plan to attend in what will be the
largest Olympiad, with about 12,000 athletes competing.

<TEXT>
   The Parliament approved a reshuffled
Cabinet on Thursday to help Premier Branko Mikulic fight
Yugoslavia's worst economic crisis.
   During the parliamentary session, Vice Premier Janez Zemljaric
defended a government austerity program introduced in May. The
program has set off a wave of workers' protest strikes nationwide
over wages and inflation.
   Mikulic survived calls for his resignation in May when
Parliament decided against voting on no-confidence motions
submitted by the nation's two most economically developed
republics, Slovenia and Croatia.
   He promised then to reconstruct his Cabinet to promote more
capable people.
   Mikulic picked Radoslav Bohinc, a former deputy economy minister
of Slovenia, as federal minister of economy, a new Cabinet post.
   Franc Horvat, also from Slovenia, replaced Miodrag Mirovic, from
Montenegro, as new minister of tourism.
   Dragi Donev, minister without portfolio from the southern
republic of Macedonia, was elected as minister of transport. He
succeeds Mustafa Pljakic from Kosovo province.
   Four other new officials elected by Parliament became Cabinet
ministers without portfolio.
   Communist Yugoslavia, which broke with the Soviet bloc in 1948,
is struggling with Europe's highest rate of inflation at 175
percent, a $21 billion foreign debt, falling living standards and
growing labor unrest.
   Numerous strikes have been held since May when the government
introduced its economic program of substantial price increases and
hefty wage cuts.
   The measures, made in conjunction with the International
Monetary Fund, are designed to curb inflation and help repay the
foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented economy.
   ``The May measures are a strong and brave economic program, and
they were accepted as such by our foreign creditors,'' Zemljaric
said.

<HEAD>Wedtech Prosecutor: Defense Attacks on Meese are a Smokescreen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor ridiculed defense tactics
at the Wedtech corruption trial Thursday, saying they were a bid to
cloud the case with allegations against Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others on trial since
mid-March are charged with a racketeering conspiracy that allegedly
turned Wedtech Corp. into a vehicle for bribery and kickbacks.
   Prosecutors claim Wedtech, a now-defunct military contractor,
grew into a multimillion-dollar concern by committing fraud against
a government program that set aside contracts for minority-owned
businesses.
   A key element of the defense case, however, was the claim that
corrupt Wedtech executives had connections to Reagan White House
insiders like Meese and did not need to buy Biaggi's influence to
obtain the no-bid defense contracts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Wilson, in a day-long rebuttal of
the defense's closing arguments, compared the so-called ``Meese
defense'' to a squid that ``squirts black ink into the sea,
eveything gets cloudy, everything gets muddy.
   ``It's impossible to see the creature and he escapes,'' said
Wilson, adding that his admittedly ``silly parable'' showed ``what
so much of the defense in this case has been.''
   He compared it to ``a squid under attack. Talk about something
else. Don't talk about the facts. Create a diversion and a
smokescreen so there's a lot of ink and muddy waters.''
   In his closing argument Thursday, Biaggi attorney James LaRossa
said Meese was ``at the core of the conspiracy'' and accused the
attorney general of orchestrating corruption by investigating
Wedtech's competitors while allowing the company to pay his legal
fees during his confirmation hearings in Washington.
   Another prosecutor, Edward J. Little, shocked the courtroom last
week when he conceded in his summation that Meese ``was a sleaze''
but said his activities had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of
Biaggi and his co-defendants.
   In his rebuttal argument, Wilson hammered at that point.
   ``The biggest smokescreen or diversion in this case _ to protect
them (the defendants) from the truth _ is Ed Meese,'' said Wilson.
   Meese was under scrutiny for some time because of his Wedtech
connections, but a special prosecutor in Washington, James C.
McKay, determined there was insufficient evidence to charge Meese
with wrongdoing. However, McKay questioned the attorney general's
ethics on several issues.
   Meese has said he will leave office later this summer.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley was to instruct the
jury on the law governing its deliberations Friday, before it began
weighing evidence in the four-month-old trial. Motley's charge to
the jury was expected to last all day.

   Amnesty International appealed to Sudan on
Thursday to investigate reported massacres of hundreds of civilians
by government forces fighting rebels.
   The London-based human rights group also called on Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi's government to repeal amputation and flogging
as legal penalties.
   In a 10-page report, Amnesty urged Sudan to ``take firm measures
to assert the rule of law'' and establish independent inquries into
reported massacres in the southern part of the East African nation.
   The report followed a letter the group sent to Sudan in May
outlining its concerns over reported human rights abuses. Amnesty
said it received no reply.
   The Sudanese People's Liberation Army, based in the Christian
and animist south, has waged a guerrilla war against
Moslem-dominated governments in the northern capital of Khartoum
since 1983.
   The rebels oppose Islamic law, introduced by ousted President
Gafaar Nimeiri, which imposes amputation and flogging for certain
offenses, Amnesty International said.
   No amputations have been carried out since the military toppled
Nimeiri while he was visiting Egypt in 1985, but floggings continue
and courts still pass amputation sentences, the report said.
   Massacres of unarmed civilians have taken place ``apparently
because they belonged to an ethnic group regarded as sympathetic to
or supportive of the (rebels),'' it said.
   Soldiers and militiamen reportedly massacred 1,000 to 2,000
Dinka tribesmen in the town of Wau in August and September 1987, it
said.
   Hundreds of other Dinka civilians were burned to death by mobs
in the town of Ad-Daien when police failed to intervene, the report
said.
   Relief agencies have estimated that fighting has displaced up to
half the 6 million residents of the south, the report said.
Hundreds of thousands of them fled to neighboring Ethiopia, where
the government is fighting its own civil war against rebels in the
north.

   The House passed a $5.8 billion relief package
for drought-stricken farmers Thursday after scaling back a heavily
debated price-support increase for the dairy industry.
   ``Hold on,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de
la Garza, D-Texas, declared as the House approved the measure.
``Help is coming in a sensible, rational, compassionate way.''
   Approval came after dairy-state lawmakers responded to a
drumroll of criticism by compromising on a plan to increase the
price-support level for milk. The House adopted a scaled-back
version that still would leave the cost of the benefit above the
$100 million level.

   Consumer spending increased in June at the
fastest pace in 10 months, the government said Thursday, fueling
concern over inflation and whether the economy will have room for
production of exports.
   The Commerce Department said personal consumption spending,
which includes virtually everything except interest on debt, shot
up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the steepest climb
since a 1.3 percent gain in August, two months before the October
stock market crash.
   The report was a disappointment to many economists who are
looking for growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow
the nation's trade deficit.

   A news leak on a covert plan to undermine
Panamanian military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega came from the

   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the panel, and the

they believed the leak was a ``heavy-handed'' attempt to derail a

   On one patrol Thursday, four men whose ages ranged from 16 to 24
drove through Arab east Jerusalem to the Jewish community of Neve
Yaacov and escorted bus No. 25, often a target of Arab stoning
attacks, to the center of the city.
   Officials fear such patrols by members of Kahane's Kach

   The morning after someone burned down
Bruce Hartford's home, friends and neighbors came by to offer help
and sympathy. Standing in the ashes of all he'd lost, he found
himself wondering if any of them had lit the match.
   ``People are coming by and you think, `I wonder if it's Jim or
Bob or Bill,' '' Hartford said.
   Fifteen unsolved arsons since May 5 have reduced the town of 850
to waves of rumor and fearful speculation about everyone.
   Knowing that most of the fires have been set around midnight or
1 a.m., many residents don't leave their houses after dark.
   In most homes, someone keeps watch through the night.
   In many, there's a gun near the door.
   Morning talk in the Old Corner Store drifts to how many days
have passed since the last fire.
   ``People in town have changed,'' said Pat Perkins, whose family
escaped its burning house when her husband heard something in the
yard and smelled smoke. ``Everybody used to be very happy and
smiling, laughing, talking. Now it's long faces, tired, nervous.''
   The town, 125 miles north of Concord, is ``on the defensive
now,'' Hartford said. ``People are staying pretty much to
themselves because no one knows who it is.''
   ``It could be one of your best friends, someone you've known for
years and never suspected,'' Perkins agreed.
   By daylight, Jefferson's 100 square miles of fields, forests and
back roads nestle in the shadow of the White Mountains'
Presidential Range. Tourists on their way from Mount Washington
pass through the village's three blocks, where they find the Old
Corner Store, three gas stations, a post office and public library
and little more.
   With no local industry, most residents commute to nearby towns
for work.
   About 30 volunteers make up the fire department. Jefferson has
no police force. The town depends on state police in Twin Mountain,
about 12 miles away.
   ``You see someone who looks haggard and drawn in the corner
store on Sunday morning and you know it's because they were up all
night,'' said Charles Bond, a state senator. ``We're not unlike the
hostages in a hijacking. It's a feeling of helplessness.''
   The fires that began in fields and brush escalated to barns,
unoccupied houses and two occupied homes. Back roads and main
routes alike are dotted with blackened shells and foundations. One
of the burned homes is 1{ blocks from the fire station. No one has
been injured in the fires.
   Authorities have said most of the fires began at the back of the
buildings and most were set late at night. They've refused to
divulge other details.
   Finding patterns is the key to finding the arsonist, according
to experts.
   ``There is always a pattern. It may be as illogical as you can
imagine,'' said Charles King, who after 23 years with the the New
York City Fire Department began his own fire investigating firm.
   Alex Ahart, executive secretary of the International Association
of Arson Investigators, said patterns can be found in the time of
day, the day of the week, the location, the method and other
details.
   ``A serial arsonist will progress,'' Ahart said. ``He'll work
his way up the ladder. Little fires become bigger fires and bigger
fires become yet bigger fires. As they get bolder and more
accustomed to what they're doing, whatever drives them to do this
becomes a bigger need or addiction.''
   Plainclothes state policemen driving unmarked cars now patrol
Jefferson, and investigators have asked the FBI to try to develop a
psychological profile of the fire starter. A member of the state
fire marshal's office has moved to town.
   At least 200 people attended a recent town meeting called by
state police to calm residents' fears.
   The Jefferson Firemen's Association has offered a $5,000 reward
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is
responsible.
   At Hartford's burned-out house, the reward poster sits amid
flower pots that stood in what was the dooryard.
   He and his wife, son and stepdaughter scrambled out a bathroom
window onto a roof and down a ladder to escape the fire that broke
out at about 1:15 a.m. They lost everything. A 5-month-old Springer
spaniel and a cat didn't make it out.
   Hartford's wife, Donna, and her daughter won't sleep at night
unless someone is awake, he said. Blueprints already are drawn for
another home on the site, but the new house will be only one story
_ easier to escape.
   ``It's tough to live this way right now,'' said Hartford, 43,
who manages a building materials store in nearby Littleton.
   Jefferson, ``before this started, was a very cohesive town, a
traditional, small town where everyone would look out for each
other,'' said Greg Brown, a local innkeeper. While closeness
remains, ``you look over your shoulder, you are suspicious of your
neighbor. It may break some bonds.''
   State police Lt. Thomas Kennedy said people ``are attempting to
protect their own property, and we have word that people are
establishing their own citizen patrols late at night to identify
this individual.''
   He has encouraged residents instead to call police with anything
unusual.
   Mrs. Hartford told a story about a man who got a flat tire while
driving late at night, but was afraid to leave his car until
daylight. Another resident recounted how a plainclothes policeman
emerged from the woods near a barn and was met by three people with
guns trained on him.
   ``I wouldn't walk this street when it starts getting dark,''
Perkins said.
   It's difficult to convince people who feel their lives are
threatened not to take action, Mrs. Hartford said.
   ``We're all frightened to death,'' she said. ``We don't want to
hurt anyone, but we want to protect what's rightfully ours.''
   Perhaps the intensity of the investigation will drive the
arsonist to leave or to stop setting fires for a time, leaving
residents with only their fear.
   ``I've heard many people say they are not going to sleep again
until this person is caught,'' said innkeeper Brown.

   You know how you'll be standing in the
grocery checkout line and you'll pick up one of those tabloids with
the screaming headlines? And the story inside never lives up to the
promise on the cover?
   Fox has turned that kind of an idea into a television show,
``The Reporters,'' making its debut Saturday.
   True, there are no stories, at least in the premiere, about
aliens from outer space or two-headed babies.
   But the first installment does tease with the promise to
``answer the nagging question _ is Mike Tyson a homosexual?''
   Never mind that no one who screened the show at the TV critics'
convention here could recall ever hearing the ``nagging question,''
what seemed immediately more interesting than the answer was what
happened to the person who asked.
   Reporter Steve Dunleavy did put the question to Tyson, after a
fashion, but the program never gives the promised answer, other
than Tyson's mumble about such rumors being typical when you have
all the money and women.
   Otherwise, Dunleavy's piece is a rambling profile that reveals
little that is new about the heavyweight champ.
   ``The Reporters'' begins with a dramatic, fast-paced opening
similar to CBS' ``West 57th.'' What follows isn't really a news
show, though the reporters from ``The Reporters`` defended it as
such during a heated presentation to television critics.
   Earlier in the week, the same critics got a peek at GTG's
syndicated magazine show, ``USA Today: The Television Show.''
Questions about its ``Entertainment Tonight''-style of happy talk
paled next to ``The Reporters,'' which makes ``USA Today: The
Television Show'' look like ``CBS Reports'' by comparison.
   On ``The Reporters,'' the reporters make less-than-subtle
statements of their own conclusions about their stories. Getting
the other side _ or at least presenting it to viewers _ seems an
alien concept.
   Dunleavy even suggested there was no difference between his
editorializing in the Tyson piece and the commentary written by the
TV critics who were questioning his tactics. He didn't seem to
grasp the difference between clearly labeled opinion and something
presented as objective reportage.
   For instance, after Tyson tells Dunleavy he'd do something
``irrational'' to anyone who threatened his wife, Dunleavy gushes
in voiceover, ``And believe me, he means it!''
   Dunleavy is a veteran of Rupert Murdoch's tabloids in Australia
and more recently worked at the Star and the New York Post. Murdoch
owns Fox Broadcasting Co. Dunleavy is also seen on Fox's syndicated
news show, ``A Current Affair.''
   ``The Reporters'' is from the same people who do ``A Current
Affair,'' but that show somehow has an edge of wink-wink,
nudge-nudge, thanks in part to host Maury Povich, that is lacking
in the deadly serious and self-important ``The Reporters.''
   Rafael Abramovitz, another of ``The Reporters'' who is also a
veteran of ``A Current Affair'' became angry at the TV critics, at
one point explaining his cracking voice _ ``I'm trembling, because
I'm offended!''
   Besides the Tyson piece, critics took exception to a story in
which reporter Krista Bradford helped a Taiwanese student legalize
her alien status and avoid deportation.
   In the final scene, Bradford shows the girl a tape of an
interview with a government official agreeing to let her stay in
the United States. The girl, overwhelmed by the news, hugs
Bradford. Then the crew takes her to the Statue of Liberty.
   CBS' Dan Rather had some emotional encounters with traumatized
Vietnam veterans for a recent network documentary and the network
took the veterans to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. But somehow it
all served to illustrate the issue without becoming embarrassingly
self-conscious.
   Abramovitz disagreed. ``If you think they (the networks) work a
story any differently than we do, they're a lot better at pulling
the wool over your eyes than we are,`` he said.
   ``I think we can display emotion without commenting on the
issues,'' said Bradford. ``I agree it's a fine line, and I'm happy
with where I have placed it.''
   Abramovitz called the show ``first-rate journalism.''
   ``We used to have a trick. We used to hide all these things and
make it look like `objective journalism,''' he said. ``I think it's
time to come out in the open and tell it like it is.
   `We're going to be doing stories about real people in a real way
and we're not going to confuse people about what's on the screen or
what's in our minds.''
   The critics didn't get to screen Abramovitz's piece for the
premiere show; the story, called ``The Actress and the Dwarf,'' was
still being edited.
   The reporters on ``The Reporters'' might have a point about
elitism. Low-brow entertainment has its place, and who doesn't have
a guilty pleasure?
   Viewed as unintentional spoof of the ``60 Minutes'' genre, ``The
Reporters'' is not bad entertainment. But calling it an objective
news show is a little scary.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE ``REALITY'' FROM FOX _ Fox has more ``reality-based''
series in production for the fall to fill in for entertainment
shows delayed by the Writers Guild strike: ``Beyond Tomorrow'' is a
science magazine show, the concept imported from Australia where it
is a top-rated TV series; and ``Cops,'' in which cameras follow
five Broward County, Fla., police officers for a week, then edit
their stories together ``Hill Street Blues'' style. Fox says even
if the strike ended tomorrow, it wouldn't be able to get ``Angels
'88,'' its new remake of ``Charlie's Angels,'' on the air until
January and would barely get its comedy ``Married ... With
Children'' on in time for the November sweeps rating period.

<TEXT>
   The story appeared in the sports section. But
like many a modern sports story, it was about finance and
economics, too.
   After a prolonged negotiation, Dave Cadigan, the first round
draft choice of the New York Jets football team, had signed a $2
million contract.
   The sticking point, according to news accounts, had been that
Cadigan and his lawyer wanted most of the $850,000 signing bonus
paid in 1988, while the maximum income tax rate is 28 percent.
   ``Cadigan wanted to receive a larger portion of his overall
bonus this year, as the maximum rate could go up in succeeding
years,'' the New York Times reported.
   There is a lot of that going around these days _ a sense that
some long-outstanding bills will soon come due for many Americans
as individuals and the country as a whole.
   When analysts listen to campaign promises from either party this
year, they react with more than the customary skepticism. How, they
ask, is anybody going to pay for these goodies when the government
is already shoulder-deep in debt?
   ``Stop kidding us,'' says the current issue of Fortune magazine,
chastising the presidential candidates for playing down the
question of a tax increase. ``Everybody knows that for the deficit
to come down, taxes must go up.''
   William Brennan, who publishes the newsletter Brennan Reports on
tax and investment planning, is giving advice very similar to what
Cadigan got from his attorney.
   Normally, Brennan says, savvy taxpayers begin around this time
of year figuring out how to defer as much income as possible past
New Year's Day, in order to reduce the tax bills they will face.
   ``In the past, planning was usually concentrated on deferring
income _ that's no longer true!'' he observes.
   ``There may be cases where income should be accelerated into
1988, while tax rates are low. In the future, a 28 percent or 33
percent rate may be pretty appetizing when we look back to 1988.''
   It is less than two years since Congress overhauled the income
tax system, curbing or eliminating many tax deductions. The
legislators were able to sell the bill to the public by lowering
tax rates.
   So you might expect cries of outrage at talk of raising those
rates again. But there are other forces at work as well.
   One is the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, also enacted in 1986,
that mandates across-the-board cuts in spending for government
programs unless specific goals are met toward balancing the federal
budget.
   In this election year, says Pamela Pecarich, director of tax
policy at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand, policymakers
probably can dodge the Gramm-Rudman ax with some imaginative
maneuvering and optimistic assumptions. ``Next year will be a
different story,'' she says.
   Then there are the stirrings of inflation that lately have
troubled Wall Street _ and that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, has spoken of with unusually candid concern.
   These inflation worries arise out of a vibrant economy in which
industry is enjoying a renascence and unemployment has fallen to a
14-year low.
   But that near-boom has been financed to a great extent with
other people's money _ in many cases, money borrowed from foreign
investors to pay for goods made by foreign manufacturers.
   ``There is very good momentum in the economy right now,'' says
Paul Boltz, financial economist at the investment management firm
of T. Rowe Price Associates.
   However, he adds, ``We haven't started to pay for this party.
And we won't until we have a trade surplus.''

   They stood on their heads and yodeled. They
smushed marshmallows in their mouths and chanted, ``Chubby bunny,
chubby bunny, chubby bunny.'' They dressed as Uncle Sam and tapped
danced on stilts.
   They were weird. But they had a purpose.
   More than 100 people staged their weirdest acts last week for a
chance to be seen on the big screen with a guy who proudly bills
himself as ``Weird Al.''
   His real name is Al Yankovic, a 27-year-old Southern California
native who hit the big time in 1983 with a song called ``Another
One Rides the Bus.''
   It was his way of laughing at pop culture _ the song is a parody
of the rock group Queen's hit song, ``Another One Bites the Dust.''
He's been laughing his way to the bank ever since.
   Five albumns later, Weird Al is on the radio and video music
stations again laughing at pop culture, this time with ``I'm Fat''
from his ``Even Worse'' albumn. The song and LP is a takeoff on
Michael Jackson's ``I'm Bad'' from the ``Bad'' album.
   ``Most of the songs I do are about food or TV _ two of the
things that have shaped my life most,'' Yankovic said.
   Five years later, Weird Al is still, well, weird. And he's
making a full-length feature film to prove it called ``U H F,'' due
for release next summer. Shooting was to begin in early August in
Tulsa.
   ``It feels kind of cold and clammy,'' said the former college
disc jockey. ``It's a lot harder to be funny for an hour and a half
than it is for three or four minutes,'' he said, referring to his
work with music videos.
   Ten years ago, Yankovic was an architecture student at Cal-Poly
San Louis Obispo College. He left with a degree and moved on to
develop Weird Al. Now he has a movie deal to film the screenplay he
and longtime friend and manager Jay Levey finished in 1983.
   ``The character that I play is going to be somewhat like Weird
Al,'' Yankovic said. ``But this isn't going to be `Weird Al's Big
Adventure.'''
   ``The movie is a cross between `It's a Wonderful Life,' `The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `Purple Rain,''' said Levey, who is
directing the film. ``It's a love story.''
   OK, not really. Yankovic's character, George Newman, owns a UHF
TV station and turns it into the hottest thing around by putting on
nice, wholesome, weird programming.
   Levey began managing Yankovic's career ``from his inception .. .
when he was an embryo.'' He also has directed the Weird Al videos,
a change of pace from directing ``U H F,'' his first feature film.
   ``I just kind of fell into directing. Shooting music videos is
kamikaze work. You have two days to do four days of work,'' Levey
said. ``The pacing is not quite so deadly in film.''
   The Tulsa auditions were an open call for acts that may be used
later during the eight-week filming schedule when staging a
telethon to save Newman's station, Levey said.
   ``They came at us for five hours. They were all so strange,'' he
said. ``It's hard to describe them without sounding ridiculous. But
they were all great.''
   The movie is being filmed in Tulsa because it's ``the perfect
Anytown,'' Levey said. ``And that's meant as a very affectionate
compliment to Tulsa.''
   Executive producer Gray Frederickson suggested Tulsa as a film
location after his experience here in 1982 while shooting ``The
Outsiders.'' And having a chance to come back home makes working in
the state more desirable, he said.
   ``This is repeat business, so that's great,'' said Mary Nell
Clark, director of the Oklahoma Film Office.
   ``U H F'' is the fourth motion picture filmed in the state this
year. ``The Killing Device'' was filmed in Tulsa in April, ``The
Bounty Hunter'' in Sand Springs in May and portions of ``Rainman''
in Guthrie, Hinton and El Reno in June.
   Clark said she is able to sell the state to film companies
because of the varied location work that is available. ``I always
tell them about the varied terrain. I've hyped that so much now
that I think they believe me.''
   Television, video and full-length feature filming in Oklahoma
brought in about $50 million last year, Clark said.

<HEAD>Drought Bites Into Cherry Pies and Bean Soup, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought has taken its toll on beans, peas and
other food crops as well as chewing away at big-ticket items like
corn, soybeans and spring wheat, says the Agriculture Department.
   ``The drought's greatest impacts on fruit and vegetable crops
are likely to be on dry edible beans, tart cherries, green peas,
sweet corn, and snap beans for canning,'' says economist Glenn Zepp.
   ``Wisconsin and Minnesota produce about 50 percent of U.S. sweet
corn and green peas, much of which is on non-irrigated acreage,''
he says. ``Wisconsin produces about 40 percent of the U.S. snap
bean output, about half of which is grown on non-irrigated
acreage.''
   The production of vegetables grown for the fresh market tends to
be concentrated on irrigated land, so the drought impact has not
been so great.
   Zepp, writing in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, provided an appraisal of how the hot weather and drought
has affected several high-value crops.
   Here's a summary of his analysis:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANNED VEGETABLES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Midwestern output of green peas is about 50 percent below
normal. Sweet corn and green beans are harvested later in the
summer, and production depends on rainfall in the remainder of the
season. Canners expect Midwestern sweet corn and green bean
production to be only 70 percent to 75 percent of what had been
planned, and carrot and beet production is expected to be 60
percent to 65 percent.
   Canners boosted prices of peas, sweet corn and snap beans by 10
percent to 20 percent in June because of anticipated production
shortfalls.
   Most of the corn, peas and beans grown in Wisconsin and
Minnesota are for canning. Vegetables for freezing are concentrated
in the Pacific Northwest, where water for irrigation generally has
been adequate for vegetable production this summer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POTATOES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hot, dry weather in June hurt development of potatoes across the
Northcentral states, reducing stands and stressing plants. The USDA
estimates 1988 total potato acreage at 1.27 million acres, down 2
percent from last year. The area for fall harvest is estimated at
1.06 million acres, down 3 percent from last year. The large 1987
fall crop resulted in generally lower prices, causing farmers to
reduce acreage this season.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SWEET POTATOES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Growers planted 93,900 acres of sweet potatoes for 1988, down 3
percent from last year. The biggest change was in Louisiana, where
acreage dropped nearly 11 percent from 1987. Dry soils delayed
planting.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRY EDIBLE BEANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Drought appears to have contributed to a 36 percent cut in
Michigan's dry bean acreage this year, since most of the crop is on
non-irrigated land. Dry weather delayed plantings in Michigan,
which increased the chance of frost damage this fall before the
crop is mature. Also, some growers shifted dry bean acreage to
soybeans, hoping for higher returns.
   Michigan grows mainly navy beans, accounting for about 60
percent of last year's navy bean harvest nationwide. Navy bean
prices rose nearly 40 percent during the third week of June because
of anticipated drought losses and smaller supplies.
   The July estimate of area for harvest for all types of dry beans
was 1.51 million acres, down 13 percent from last year. In addition
to the decline in Michigan, large acreage reductions were reported
for California, Colorado, Idaho and Nebraska. North Dakota, on the
other hand, reported 21,000 acres more for harvest than in 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>APPLES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Production is forecast at 8.07 billion pounds this year, down 23
percent from the 1987 apple harvest. All regions expect smaller
production. In Washington state, the stress on trees from last
year's record crop and this year's varied bloom and set contributed
to reduced prospects. Trees in New York's Lake Ontario region
suffered from some winter damage, and Michigan's crop is expected
to be smaller because of spring freezes and drought.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GRAPES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The California total grape harvest is forecast at 4.7 million
tons, up 1 percent from last season. Raisin-type grape output is
forecast at 2.15 million tons, down 2 percent from last year. Some
irrigators have had water allocations scaled back, and many have
switched to costly pumping of well water.
   Production of table-type grapes in California is forecast at
600,000 tons, up 18 percent from last year. Tight water supplies
have not affected table grape production, and growers are reporting
heavy yields.
   California wine grape production is forecast at 1.95 million
tons, the same as last year. Drought has had little effect so far,
but some acreage may undergo stress as irrigation water runs out.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TART CHERRIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Production is forecast at 207 million pounds, down 42 percent
from 1987. Production in Michigan, the largest cherry producer, was
off 43 percent. New York's output is down 34 percent from last year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TOBACCO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The total U.S. tobacco area for harvest in 1988 is estimated at
624,000 acres, up 6 percent from last year. Both flue-cured and
burley showed increases, reflecting higher effective quotas for
1988. Moisture has been adequate for plant growth in much of the
flue-cured belt, and yield prospects look good. But dryer
conditions prevailed in the burley area, so yields likely will be
reduced.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUGAR BEETS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Estimated plantings of sugar beets were put at 1.32 million
acres, up 4 percent from last season. The acreage was up in all
major growing areas except California. However, dry conditions
resulted in poor germination, requiring growers to replant some
fields several times. According to industry sources, more than
250,000 acres, mostly in the Red River Valley, had to be replanted.
In some cases, farmers may have switched to other crops having a
shorter growing season or requiring less soil moisture for seed
germination.
   According to USDA analysts, sugar beet production will be
substantially below last year's near-record harvest, while cane
output may equal or exceed last year's level.

   The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent
annual pace from April through June, but rising food, energy and
clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent, its
highest level in almost six years, the government reports.
   Some private economists worried that the big jump in inflation
reported Wednesday signaled the concluding stages of the current
long economic recovery and could well result in a recession some
time next year.

   Investors who jumped into the agricultural
commodity markets when the Midwestern drought became apparent last
spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather
changed for the wetter, experts say.
   With crop conditions either static or improving, prices for
future delivery of grains and soybeans have fallen precipitously.
   The drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the
livestock and sugar futures markets, and has prompted some
economists to lower their month-old projections for 1989 food
inflation from about 7 percent to 6 percent or less.

   The economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annual pace in the
second quarter, according to the government, but the financial
markets focused on rising food, energy and clothing costs that
pushed the inflation rate during the period to a nearly six-year
high.
   Stock and bond prices declined Wednesday after the Commerce
Department released its economic growth report, which indicated
inflation was at 4.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter.
   The government reported that the growth rate in the gross
national product, the economy's total output of goods and services,
was down only slightly from a revised 3.4 percent increase in the
first three months of the year.
   But inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,
registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982. The
GNP price index had risen at a 3.5 percent rate in the first
quarter.
   The White House dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary
deviation, but some private economists said the current long
economic recovery may be coming to an end, setting the stage for a
recession some time next year.
   ``We have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a
by-product of our long expansion,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co. ``The demand side of our economy is now
exceeding our ability to produce, which is causing price
pressures.''
   The Federal Reserve already has pushed interest rates higher as
a way of dampening demand and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the central bank would tighten further if
inflationary pressures did not abate.
   In the bond market, the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond
lost about $5.60 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest
rate trends, jumped to 9.23 percent from 9.18 percent late Tuesday.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
20.27 to 2,053.70, its lowest close since it stood at 2,052.45 on
June 2.
   The dollar finished lower against most major currencies, while
crop futures closed mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade as late
jitters about next week's weather offset a rally that analysts said
was long overdue.

<HEAD>Giant Japanese Securities Firm To Buy Stake in Investment Boutique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wasserstein, Perella & Co.'s agreement to sell a
20 percent stake to giant Nomura Securities Co. for $100 million
represents a coup that could win the aggressive, young firm an ever
bigger share of the lucrative international merger and acquisitions
business.
   Other cash-rich Japanese companies have bought into large,
established, capital-hungry Wall Street firms. But the investment
by Nomura _ Japan's biggest securities house _ represents a
relatively more potent capital boost to the small, six-month-old
investment boutique.
   Wasserstein Perella was formed in February by two leaders of
First Boston Corp.'s highly successful mergers and acquisitions
operation, who quit to start their own firm.
   Under an agreement announced Wednesday, the two firms plan to
work together on mergers and acquisitions involving Japanese,
American and European companies. The transactions are expected to
be handled through a joint venture company.
   ``This will be a very good source of business for our firm, and
(Nomura's) knowledge of the Japanese market is a real advantage to
our clients who are looking to sell assets to Japanese buyers,''
said Michael Biondi, a vice president at Wasserstein Perella.
   Tokyo-based Nomura Securities had 1987 profits totaling $2.13
billion and a market capitalization in excess of $56 billion.
   Yoshihisa Tabuchi, Nomura's president and chief executive, said
the affiliation ``will provide our clients with unique benefits in
execution skills and strategic insight in the global mergers and
acquisitions marketplace.''
   Japanese companies long have had a keen interest in the
fast-paced M&A business that has evolved in the United States. At
the same time, Wall Street firms hungry for new sources of capital
increasingly have turned to foreign partners.
   In late 1986 Sumitomo Bank Ltd. paid $500 million for a
non-voting stake in Goldman, Sachs & Co. Last year Nippon Life
Insurance Co. acquired a 13 percent stake in Shearson Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. for $538 million.
   And also in 1987, Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co. agreed to pay
$300 million for an 18 percent stake in PaineWebber Group Inc.
   On Tuesday, Japan's fourth-largest securities house, Yamaichi
Securities Co., agreed to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in
Lodestar Group, a small U.S. merger and acquisitions firm headed by
Kenneth Miller, former M&A head for Merrill Lynch & Co. Yamaichi
also invested $100 million in Lodestar's corporate buyout fund.
   Biondi said Nomura made the investment for strategic reasons.
   ``They want to be an important factor in the global M&A market _
they want to learn and be in partnership with someone who is
perceived as a very high-quality provider of M&A advice,'' he said.
   One source on Wall Street said the deal ensures Wasserstein
Perella ``gets all the advantages of having the pockets of a major
player in the financial markets, while Nomura gets access to an
enviable flow of deals.''
   Indeed, Wasserstein Perella has represented such major players
as Campeau Corp., Georgia Pacific Corp., Beatrice U.S. Food Corp.
and Macmillan Inc. The firm, with offices in four U.S. cities and
in London, has advised clients on transactions valued at more than
$19 billion since its inception.
   Biondi said Nomura's contribution was the first ``outside
money'' the young investment firm had raised. ``Until now we were
100 percent owned by employee shareholders,'' he said.
   Wasserstein Perella has $500 million earmarked for leveraged
buyouts and expects to raise further capital for the buyout fund.
Nomura's contribution will be a substantial boost to the firm's
operating capital, Biondi said.
   In a statement announcing the Nomura deal, the firm stressed
that while its goal was to be a major player in mergers and
acquisitions, it did not want to amass a huge staff. That would
prevent potential problems inherent with a big workroll, such as
conflicts of interest, while sharply boosting the potential profits
for the firm's partners.
   Bruce Wasserstein, president and chief executive, and his
partner, Joseph Perella, the firm's chairman, were in Japan and
could not be reached for comment.
   The pair stunned the investment community in February when they
left First Boston, the investment house they helped propel to the
top ranks in the mergers and acquisition business. A string of
other First Boston professionals resigned to follow them, taking a
toll on the venerable investment house.
   The takeover team they headed was believed to have brought in
more than $350 million in mergers and acquisition revenue in 1987
alone, and some analysts estimated the duo was responsible for half
of First Boston's 1987 profits.

   The nation's biggest hospital industry group
is calling for caution in Prudential Insurance Co. of America's
revolutionary plan to direct policyholders to have major organ
transplants at hospitals it believes have the best survivability
rates.
   The giant insurance company's plan, announced Wednesday, could
mark a break with tradition that leaves the choice of hospital up
to patient and physician, but is seen as helping to hold down
rising health care costs.
   But Bruce McPherson, vice president for group health care at the
American Hospital Association in Washington, said hospital ratings
based on statistics should not be the sole criteria for judging
quality care.
   ``It is important for them to disclose their quality criteria,
how that quality criteria was designated, what the connections are
in terms of the criteria they chose and which hospitals appear on
the lists,'' McPherson said in a statement.
   Prudential is the nation's largest health insurer, covering 20
million people. It has negotiated contracts with hospitals to
perform the special surgeries, including heart, kidney or liver
transplants.
   Dr. Dan Dragalin, vice president of the Prudential Group's
medical services division, said the company would use financial
incentives, such as coverage of travel costs, to have policyholders
travel to a handful of hospitals nationwide.
   ``We decided if we were going to direct patients (to specific
hospitals) we would choose institutions that meet very tough
criteria,'' said Dragalin. He also said Prudential chose hospitals
that offered the highest quality package for various operations.
   Prudential said hospitals found foremost in the industry were
promised ``volume in exchange for cost discounts.'' The company
negotiated discounts of 25 percent to 30 percent on the complex
operations, which can cost up to $250,000.
   Diedre Perkins, manager of group medical services, said the
company also tried to find institutions that could serve as
regional facilities for Prudential beneficiaries requiring a
particular operation.
   Joel Miller, deputy director of the Health Insurance Association
of America, said his group long has advocated the use of designated
hospitals for complex operations.
   ``We believe there are two distinct advantages,'' he said.
``When only a few hospitals perform a high volume of transplant
operations, we believe the outcome of the operations are likely to
improve. We also see designated hospitals preventing unnecessary
duplication of investment in transplant capacity, which will hold
down costs.''
   James Mortimer, president of the Midwest Business Group on
Health, a Chicago-based coalition of employers, also said the plan
could prompt lower health-care costs.
   ``Getting the insurance industry to actively purchase care for
its corporate clients is a major step,'' Mortimer said in
Wednesday's edition of the Chicago Tribune.
   Of the 50 to 60 hospitals that do transplants, Prudential found
three qualified for heart transplants, two for liver transplants
and seven for kidney transplants.
   Dragalin said Prudential intends to expand the system to include
other complex and costly procedures, including bone marrow
transplants, coronary artery bypass surgery, burn treatment and a
host of neurosurgical operations.
   Dragalin said the company is negotiating with eight hospitals to

   The 1.5 million Prudential beneficiaries who are members of
health maintenance organizations or managed care plans will be
required to use the designated institutions, the company said,
while Prudential plans to continue paying for the operations of
other policyholders who use non-designated hospitals.
   Prudential said its primary goal is to prevent patients from
being drawn to inexperienced hospitals by lower prices for complex
operations.
   ``Hospitals are increasingly diversifying and performing
procedures they haven't done in the past,'' Dragalin said, adding
that many are trying to compensate for the loss of some traditional
business to health maintenance organizations.

<HEAD>SouthernNet, Teleconnect Agree To Form Long Distance Holding
Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new telephone holding company that will become
the nation's fourth-largest long distance carrier has no plans to
take on the industry leaders nationally, according to company
officials.
   SouthernNet Inc. of Atlanta and Teleconnect Co. of Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, said Wednesday they signed a letter of intent to create a
yet-to-be-named holding company that will form a long distance
carrier serving about 400,000 customers. The company would have
annual revenue of more than $400 million.
   Teleconnect, formed in 1979, and SouthernNet, founded in 1984,
have grown rapidly, providing long distance and other telephone
services mainly to businesses within their regions.
   Teleconnect, which made its initial public stock offering this
year, operates in 21 mainly Midwestern states. The company earned
$7.6 million, or 90 cents per share, on revenue of $167.8 million
last year.
   SouthernNet operates in 10 Southeastern states and in
Washington, D.C., and earned $8.7 million, or 62 cents per share,
on revenue of $228.6 million last year.
   Trading was halted on both companies' shares early Wednesday
afternoon with SouthernNet standing at $20.62{ a share on the
over-the-counter market and Teleconnect at $15 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Wednesday's joint announcement said the holding company would
concentrate on regional operations and not compete directly with
the big three of AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint.
   The companies have ``high penetration in some areas and we
specifically do not want to to out and try to cover the nation,''
said SouthernNet President O. Gene Gabbard, who will serve as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Atlanta-based holding
company.
   Teleconnect chairman and chief executive Clark E. McLeod will be
vice chairman and president of the company.
   The nation's long distance market has been estimated at $50
billion annually, with AT&T getting 72 percent. MCI has about 10
percent and US Sprint about 7 percent, according to Jack Grubman,
an analyst with PaineWebber.
   ``Our aspiration is not to be a national player but to be very
strong regional players sharing research and development and
sharing network capacities,'' McLeod said.
   Shareholders, who still must approve the deal, would receive one
share of stock in the new holding company for each share they now
hold in the regional companies.
   The companies also announced quarterly results Wednesday.
   Teleconnect reporting second quarter earnings of $2.6 million,
or 23 cents per share, on revenue of $60.3 million.
   SouthernNet earned $5.9 million, or 43 cents per share, on
revenue of $65.9 million, compared with a profit of $3.07 million,
or 22 cents per share, on $55.47 in revenue during the year-earlier
quarter.
   The latest quarter includes $2.42 million from SouthernNet's
sale of a cellular telephone subsidiary.
   The boards of both companies have approved formation of the new
company, which remains subject to regulatory approval as well as
the execution of a definitive agreement. Gabbard estimated the deal
would be completed in the fourth quarter.
   The two companies have worked together previously, and last
month announced the creation of a national toll-free service.

<HEAD>USX Head Says Steel Unit Could Be For Sale, But No Buyers Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the steel industry enjoying a healthy
revival after seven years of depression, USX Corp. is willing to
sell a chunk of its steel-making USS division, according to
Chairman David Roderick.
   But so far, proposals to spin off up to 20 percent of the unit
have come only from investment bankers, not actual principals,
Roderick said Wednesday at his quarterly news conference.
   Roderick said he welcomed proposals, ``providing we were offered
full, f-u-l-l, value...and we certainly have no incentive to sell
it for less than full value.''
   The chairman of the energy and steel company declined to suggest
a figure.
   ``We wouldn't want to restrict the imagination of potential
buyers,'' he said.
   USX President Charles Corry said any deal probably would involve
USX making a public offering of stock in part of the steelmaking
division.
   USX would retain tax benefits accumulated during steel's years
of unprofitable operations, said Corry, who is considered a leading
candidate to succeed Roderick when the chairman reaches the
company's mandatory retirement age of 65 next May.
   Meanwhile, Roderick projected 1988 steel industry shipments of
81 million tons or more, a high figure that would mean two more
quarters of robust business.
   With demand for steel showing no signs of faltering and mills
running at or near capacity, prices are rising and profits are
flowing in, he said.
   Roderick said the USS division, the domestic industry's largest
producer, is reconsidering an Oct. 1 price increased it announced
to customers of flat-rolled steel.
   The timing of the price move was undermined by Bethlehem, the
third-largest producer, which scheduled increases of up to 5.5
percent for Jan. 1. No. 2-ranked LTV Steel Co. followed Bethlehem's
lead.
   Roderick said price increases are justified even though his
company is churning out profits of $70 per ton.
   ``Back in the first first quarter of this year, our prices were
about 19 percent below 1981. We've picked some of that back up in
the second quarter, but my guess is that we're still 12 to 13
percent below the 1981 steel prices,'' he said.
   ``And when we get out of this decade...the steel prices are
going to be lower than when we came into the decade,'' Roderick
said. ``I ask you, how many manufacturing industries in the United
States are going to get through the decade of the '80s with
absolutely zero inflation in price?''
   Stronger earnings in steel compensated for the diminished
performance in energy for a fourth consecutive quarter as USX on
Tuesday reported second-quarter profits of $213 million, or 74
cents per share, on sales of $4.3 billion.
   ``Oil carried us from 1982 through 1987,'' Roderick said. ``This
is the first period when earnings from energy were lower than
earnings from steel.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up in Technical Reaction to Earlier Falls; Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly stronger today against
most European currencies in what dealers said was a technical
reaction to earlier declines. Gold was weaker.
   Traders said the dollar was recovering through heavy central
bank intervention after it was driven down Wednesday by
disappointing U.S. gross national product figures.
   ``It went down unbelievably fast Wednesday, and so I believe
there is some room to make (the dollar) a little firmer today,''
said a Frankfurt trader. ``The central banks really pushed hard on
the dollar, and now it's a bit undervalued.''
   The U.S. economy grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 1988,
less than the 4 percent rate widely anticipated.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7360, compared
with $1.7265 Wednesday. Dealers said the Bank of England intervened
after the pound, surging on expectations of higher British interest
rates, hit 3.22 Deutschmarks, its highest rate against the West
German currency in two years.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates included: 1.8552 West German marks, up from 1.8495; 1.5340
Swiss francs, down from 1.5375; 6.2555 French francs, up from
6.2375; 2.0892 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0820; 1,370.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,365.50; and 1.2085 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2070.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 132.10. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 132.17 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $433. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$428.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $431.25, down from $432.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $433.78, up
from Wednesday's closing bid price of $432.34.
   Later, silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.74 a
troy ounce, down from Wednesday's $7.

   The dollar fell slightly today, but stock prices
were firmer in slow trading after the release of U.S. gross
national product figures for the second quarter of the year.
   On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the dollar opened at 131.67 yen,
the day's low, and was stable around the 131.70-131.80 yen range
during the morning session. It edged up to close at the day's high
of 132.10 yen, down 0.40 yen from Wednesday's close.
   Volume totaled $4.8 billion, slightly up from Wednesday's $4.3
billion.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, which posted its second biggest gain this year Wednesday by
surging 434.81 points, rose another 57.52 points, or 0.2 percent,
to close at 27.796.09.
   In the first section, 850 million shares changed hands, compared
to Wednesday's 1.3 billion shares.
   Exchange dealers said growing concern about inflation in the
United States put downward pressure on the dollar.
   The U.S. gross national product, the broadest measures of an
economy's health, grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter, down
slightly from the revised 3.4 percent rate the previous quarter,
according to figures released Wednesday. But inflation registered
the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982.
   Securities analysts discounted any major effect of the dollar's
fall on the stock market.
   ``You can't apply the same old principle of `When the dollar
falls, stock market also falls' any longer,'' said Keiichi Nishida
of Kidder Peabody.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Shares of Henley Will Go to Itel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henley Group Inc., after failing to gain
control of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Inc., says it will sell its
Santa Fe shares to Itel Inc. in a deal that would give Henley a 40
percent stake in the Chicago-based holding company.
   The companies valued the deal at $1.2 billion in cash and stock.
   The complex transaction agreed to Wednesday also calls for sale
to Itel of Henley's stock holdings in American President Cos. Ltd.,
a shipping container company, and of Henley's Signal Capital
subsidiary, a financing company and lessor of railroad cars.
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific, which fended off Henley's advances
over a six-month period, responded favorably. Its president and
chief executive officer, Robert Krebs, said in a news release: ``We
... are sure that Itel wil be a constructive shareholder of Santa
Fe Southern Pacific.''
   Henley's stock price rose $1.50 a share to $24.75 in
over-the-counter trading Wednesday, while Itel advanced 25 cents to
$19.87.
   Henley, a holding company run by investor Michael Dingman out of
dual headquarters in La Jolla, Calif., and Hampton, N.H., said it
would receive $827 million cash and 18.7 million shares of newly
issued Itel stock.
   That would give Henley 40 percent share of Itel, which leases
railroad cars and owns dredging and wire companies in the Chicago
area.
   Itel would get Henley's 16.9 percent share of Chicago-based
Santa Fe; its 9.6 percent holding in American President of Oakland,
Calif., and its 13.2 percent stake in Oak Industries, a Rancho
Bernardo, Calif., company that makes and distributes electronic
equipment for the cable television and other industries.
   Henley subsidiaries Signal Capital and the smaller Equilease
Corp. also would change hands, bringing Itel's total assets to $3.6
billion.
   Henley, which under Dingman has bought and reshuffled a number
of companies in recent years, would be subject to a 10-year
standstill agreement requiring it to vote its Itel shares with
management and barring further purchases, said James Knox, Itel's
senior vice president and general counsel.
   Itel principals Samuel Zell and Robert Lurie, who through a
partnership own 20 percent of Itel's 27 million shares, would be
issued warrants to purchase new stock to maintain their 20 percent
equity position, Knox said.
   The railroad portion of the deal is subject to federal antitrust
review, which the companies said is expected to take 30 days.
   Itel would emerge as the largest railroad car lessor in country,
with 30,000 railroad freight cars owned by Signal Capital's Pullman
Leasing in addition to its own 43,000 cars, the company said.
   On March 18, an adverse court ruling prompted Henley to abandon
a proxy fight for seats on Santa Fe's board, ending a six-month
battle that included attempts to buy the company. A rival suitor,
Olympia & York Developments Ltd. of Toronto, ended up with 19.6
percent of Santa Fe and two board seats.
   Itel approached Henley a few months ago specifically about
acquiring Pullman and discussions blossomed into a far-reaching
transaction among like-minded investors Dingman, Zell and Lurie,
Knox said.
   ``Part of the attraction of this deal was the possibility of
working together,'' Knox said.
   Zell, Itel's chairman and chief executive officer, and longtime
business partner Lurie, now a director, bought into Itel in 1984 as
it was emerging from bankruptcy and moved it from San Francisco to
Chicago in late 1985 and early 1986.
   Itel, which earned $8.3 million on sales of $1.3 billion last
year, leases rail cars under that name and owns Great Lakes
International, a dredging company in Oak Brook, Ill., and Anixter
Bros., a wire manufacturer in Skokie, Ill.
   Dingman, 56, built what is now Henley out of businesses spun off
in the 1985 merger that formed Allied Signal Corp. Last year, the
company lost $278 million on revenue of $3.52 billion.
   Its interests include Signal Landmark Properties, a Southern
California real estate company, Henley Manufacturing Corp., which
makes chemicals and auto parts, Fisher Scientific Group, which
produces medical supplies, and 80 percent of Wheelabrator Inc.,
which builds waste-to-energy plants.

   Del Webb Co. said it had received a $161
million buyout offer from a Los Angeles partnership but would allow
the bid to expire without a response.
   Webb, developer of the Sun City retirement communities in
Arizona, disclosed Wednesday it had received an offer from ESA
Associates for $17.50 a share for Webb's 9.2 million outstanding
shares, the company said.
   Webb stock, which has been trading in the $13- to $15-a-share
range, closed at $14.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Wednesday, down 50 cents from Tuesday.
   Terms of the offer set a Wednesday evening expiration time and
Webb did not plan to respond, said company spokesman Ernie East. He
said Webb had not satisfied itself ESA could provide financing.
   ESA is a partnership of Century City attorney Sandy Hillsberg
and developer Robert Blake. Neither responded to an afternoon

   Stock prices rose Thursday, boosted mainly by
speculative buying of selected issues.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 5.2
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,846.0 by mid-afternoon. Volume was
275.2 million shares, compared with 188.9 million shares at the
same time Wednesday.
   The market largely ignored the pound's surge and Wednesday's
news of a wider-than-expected British trade deficit in June,
dealers said.
   Instead, attention turned to speculative situations, giving
selected stocks a sharp boost.
   Among major gainers, shares in Pearson PLC shot up 42 pence, or
73 cents, to 784 pence after trading as high as 796 pence amid a
variety of rumors about the company.
   One rumor held that Pearson might sell off its oil exploration
and production operations in the North Sea. A Pearson spokesman
said the company was reviewing its options in regard to the North
Sea holding.
   Pearson shares also got a boost as attention focused on the
publishing sector, following speculation that Reed International
PLC could become the target of a takeover bid. Reed shares
continued their recent run, jumping another 20 pence to 463 pence.
   There also were rumors that News Corp., controlled by publisher
Rupert Murdoch, could sell off its more than 20 percent stake in
Pearson and then make a bid for Reed, dealers said.

   The stock market firmed slightly in the early
going today, but many investors remained on the sidelines awaiting
a clearer indication on the direction of interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.73 at 2,057.43
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 489 issues up, 377
down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.86 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts noted that the market's key focus is interest rates.
Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on Wednesday
when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than 4 percent
in the last quarter.
   ``The market can't mount any kind of sustainable move if you
have rates going against you,'' noted Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said the bond market, which opened lower today, has to
stabilize on a longer term basis before money comes off the
sidelines.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Chrysler was unchanged
at 22]. The automaker's report of lower quarterly earnings had been
expected. National Semiconductor was up [ at 10|; Digital Equipment
was unchanged at 102\, and Exxon was up \ at 45~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.27 to 149.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.27 to

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 on the

<HEAD>U.A.E. Leader Affirms Support for Opec Unity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto one name is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruler of the United
Arab Emirates affirmed Thursday his nation's support for unity
within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the
official emirates news agency WAM reported.
   The agency, reporting the meeting between Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan and cartel Secretary-General Subroto, quoted the U.A.E.
president as saying his country ``has always been at the forefront
for boosting OPEC decisions and supporting the stability of the oil
market.''
   The report did not specifically address the controversial issue
of U.A.E. oil production, but it indicated the emirates would not
undermine the 13-nation cartel by adopting unilateral decisions.
   Sheik Zayed's statements were made after Subroto gave him a
message from OEPC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, according to
the WAM report. Details of the message were not disclosed.
   The meeting was also attended by Mana Saeed Otaiba, the federal
U.A.E. oil minister. Subroto and Otaiba met earlier as oil sources
said the OPEC secretary-general sought a compromise regarding the
U.A.E. claim for a higher oil production quota.
   WAM said only that Subroto discussed with Otaiba the ``latest
developments in the world oil market.''
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said
Subroto's visit came in response to reports quoting U.A.E. oil
officials as saying the country would abandon its OPEC production
quota of 948,000 barrels of oil a day and produce about 1.5 million
barrels a day.
   They noted OPEC's price monitoring committee will meet Aug. 3 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the oil market situation in light
of Iran's decision to accept a U.N. Security Council resolution
calling for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
   The war has been casting shadows on the cartel's efforts to curb
production levels and maintain an $18 per barrel benchmark price.
Both Iraq and Iran are prominent OPEC members and have been
flouting production and pricing policies, respectively, because of
the conflict.
   The U.A.E. demand for a higher quota is also a prominent issue
for the Lausanne meeting of the five-member pricing committee which
comprises the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria,
Nigeria and Indonesia.
   Otaiba has said the U.A.E.'s current quota was not fair and did
not synchronize with its production potential, claimed to be 4
million barrels per day.

   Sematech, a research consortium of 14
semiconductor manufacturers in partnership with the federal
government, appointed longtime industry leader Robert N. Noyce as
its chief executive officer.
   Noyce, once called ``the Mayor of Silicon Valley,'' is a
co-inventor of the integrated circuit, a critical element in
computers and other electronics. He is also the co-founder of Intel
Corp. and is its vice chairman.
   Charles E. Sporck, chairman of the Sematech board of directors,
also announced Wednesday the appointment of Paul P. Castrucci, a
top technical executive at International Business Machines Corp.
with 32 years' experience, as Sematech's chief operating officer.
   Noyce said he at first took himself out of consideration because
of other commitments, but ``it finally dawned on me it was far too
important for someone else to do. I had to do it myself.''
   With the chief executive and operating officers now in place,
Noyce said he was ``confident we're going to be able to make a
quick transition into full blown operations.''
   Sematech, based in Austin, Texas, is the nation's first
semiconductor research consortium supported by both private
industry and the federal government. Sematech will sponsor and
conduct research into advanced semiconductor manufacturing
processes, materials and equipment.
   Results of the research will be available to the 14 member
companies and the Department of Defense license-royalty free, and
one to two years later will be available to non-members.
   Congress appropriated $100 million to Sematech in this year's
budget and the consortium said it is confident next fiscal year's
budget will also contain $100 million. The total budget is $250
million annually.
   Semiconductors are vital parts in almost every modern
electronics system _ from microwave ovens to communications
satellites. The electronics industry in the United States accounts
for $230 billion in annual sales and 2.5 million jobs, Sematech
said.
   Sematech's goal is world leadership in semiconductor technology
by 1993. Part of its strategy is also to work with universities
around the country, and five were named last month to receive
grants of up to $1.5 million a year for manufacturing research.
   Such consortiums have been successful in Japan but ``have been
attempted in Europe without a great deal of success,'' Noyce said.
   Sematech's staff in Austin is now at 135 and when it is in full
gear will employ 600 to 800. A large percentage of employees will
be assigned from the member companies.
   The consortium's member companies are Advanced Micro Devices,
American Telephone and Telegraph, Digital Equipment Corp., Harris
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., IBM, LSI Logic Corp.,
Micron Technology Inc., Motorola, National Semiconductor Corp., NCR
Corp., Rockwell International Corp., and Texas Instruments Inc.

   Allegheny International Inc. says it lost
$15.3 million during the company's third quarter, compared to a
loss of $29.4 million in the same period a year ago.
   The Pittsburgh-based consumer products manufacturer said
Wednesday its third-quarter loss came on sales of $233.9 million,
up from its third-quarter 1987 sales of $229.8 million.
   The company attributed the latest loss in part to the
consolidation of its Sunbeam Appliance and Oster divisions,
announced in June.
   Allegheny International also cited its reorganization under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws and its proxy fight for
control of the company's board of directors as reasons for the
latest shortfall.
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1988, Allegheny
International reported a loss of $12.6 million on sales of $744.9
million. That compared to a loss of $233.6 million on sales of
$721.6 million during the same period of fiscal 1987.

   The stock market turned mostly mixed today as
investors remained apathetic while awaiting a clearer indication on
the direction of interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 0.89 at
2,052.81 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 504 issues up, 597
down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.72 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates.
``The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,''
one trader said.
   Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on
Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than
4 percent in the last quarter.
   ``The market can't mount any kind of sustainable move if you
have rates going against you,'' noted Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said the bond market, which headed lower again today, has to
stabilize on a longer term basis before money comes off the
sidelines. As bond prices move lower, rising yields have been
attracting funds that normally would have been earmarked for
equities.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Interco soared 8] at
67}. The company received a $64-a-share buyout offer from City
Capital Associates.
   York International fell 1[ to 57[. SnyderGeneral withdrew its

<HEAD>June Gain Best in 3 Months; Spending Up at Faster Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income jumped a healthy
0.7 percent in June, the best showing in three months, while
consumer spending rose even faster, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 1.0
percent to $3.21 trillion, following a 0.6 percent increase in May.
It was the biggest increase since spending shot up 1.3 percent last
August.
   The big rise in spending is likely to be viewed as worrisome by
analysts who have been looking for consumer demand to ease to allow
room in the economy for production of exports.
   Too much consumer demand is seen as inflationary because it
places a strain on U.S. manufacturers who are fighting to lower the
trade deficit.
   The $27.9 billion increase in personal incomes to $4.04 trillion
followed a 0.5 percent rise in May, a modest 0.2 percent increase
in April and a 1.0 percent jump in March.
   With spending rising a bit faster than income, Americans'
personal savings rate fell slightly to 4.3 percent, compared with
4.4 percent in May. Still, the average savings rate for the first
half of 1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in
1987.
   Americans' after-tax income increased 0.8 percent in June after
shooting up 2.4 percent in May.
   The gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in
employment in June. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent
last month, a 14-year low.
   That was somewhat offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in farm
income in June, attributed to a $3.9 billion drop in federal farm
subsidy payments.
   The department gave these details of spending:
   _On durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three
or more years, spending rose $8.6 billion in June compared with an
increase of $2.7 billion in May.
   _On non-durable goods, spending rose $4.5 billion in June,
compared with $4.6 billion the month before.

   Michael G. Gartner, who unofficially starts
today as president of NBC News, says he faces no immediate pressure
to raise the evening news ratings or develop new programs.
   NBC President Robert C. Wright announced Wednesday he had chosen
the Iowa newspaper editor to succeed Lawrence K. Grossman, who is
stepping down after four years.
   ``Different times call for different types of people,'' Wright
said, saying that the network faced an era of ``enormous change,
both technologically and economically.''
   When Wright offered the job last week during the Democratic
National Convention, Gartner said, ``We didn't talk about the
present, we talked about the future.''
   Wright, who was installed as president after General Electric
bought NBC in 1986, has enforced financial discipline in all
network divisions and has talked of the need for innovation as the
networks' share of the viewing audience declines.
   ``He (Wright) wants me to lead, he wants me to manage, he wants
me to use my news judgment, and he wants me to be a good
businessman, but most of all he wants me to think about the future
and help lead NBC into the future, safely and soundly, and with
vigor,'' Gartner said Wednesday.
   Gartner, 49, has most recently been a part-time general news
executive with Gannett Co. Inc. and editor of the Ames (Iowa) Daily
Tribune. He is an attorney, a former president of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, and a former editor of The
Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., and the Des Moines (Iowa)
Register. From 1960 to 1974, he worked for The Wall Street Journal,
the last five as editor of the front page.
   NBC correspondent John Chancellor praised the appointment as
``audacious and intelligent.''
   ``We get various reactions to it around the water cooler here,''
Chancellor said. ``One is that Bob Wright has set good journalism
as his first priority _ that's obviously clear. Another reaction I
would have is that Gartner will be able to prove that good
journalism is the heart of the enterprise.''
   Grossman, a former public television executive, had been
criticized within NBC's news division because he had no experience
in journalism. But he said he left because of friction with the
executive office.
   Early in Wright's tenure, Grossman had refused to go along with
a cost-cutting exercise, but later fell into line.
   ``It's time for them to get their own guy in there,'' Grossman
said Wednesday in Los Angeles, where he was attending an NBC
meeting. ``Things have changed. It hasn't been all that fun lately.
I've been there four years. It's a difference in style, personality
and priorities.''
   During Grossman's tenure at NBC News, ``Nightly News'' and the
``Today'' rose to the top of the ratings. Lately, however,
``Nightly News'' has been consistently third in a tight ratings
race.
   Gartner said he met Wright a few months ago to discuss First
Amendment issues. He said they had second conversation about NBC,
and the offer came last week.
   ``I've got a lot to learn, as a starter, and I've got a lot of
new people to get to know and to deal with, and to get them to sign
on so that we can move NBC forward together,'' he said.
   Gartner's only previous experience with television was with the
Register's broadcast group, which owned television stations in
Moline, Ill., and Honolulu.
   ``He wanted to make sure the newscast gave you something,'' said
Richard Gilbert, who headed the Register broadcast group and now is
publisher of the Pioneer Press group of weekly newspapers based in
Wilmette, Ill. ``He wanted to give people news of substance and
usefulness.''
   Dennis Waller, general manager of the Ames Tribune, said Gartner
has ``an energy field that gets everybody fired up. He is just an
exceptional individual.''
   ``He has an electric personality,'' said James P. Gannon, editor
of The Des Moines Register. ``He's a brilliant journalist, a great
idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on
morale in the newsroom.''

<HEAD>Tonka Corp. To Lay Off 110 Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tonka Corp. announced a $7.6 million
second-quarter loss and said it has laid off 110 employees in a
restructuring of its Kenner Products and Tonka toy divisions.
   In cutting the 87 full-time and 23 part-time employees
Wednesday, Tonka cited disappointing sales of its once hot Pound
Puppies line and other Tonka products as well as a need to
eliminate overlapping responsibilities with the recently-acquired
Kenner Parker Toys.
   The company said its second-quarter loss came on sales of $198.4
million, and compared with earnings of $1.6 million, or 20 cents
per share, on sales of $49.6 million in the same period a year
earlier.
   Tonka attributed the loss to charges in connection with the
Kenner Parker acquisition.
   The results brought Tonka's six-month losses to $18.1 million,
compared with earnings of $3.2 million, or 41 cents a share, in the
first half of 1987. First half revenues rose to $366.8 million from
$97.9 million.
   Tonka renewed its earlier prediction that it would break even or
earn a profit for the year after reporting a loss of $7.5 million
for all of 1987.
   The layoffs announced Wednesday were the latest in a series of
employee cuts among Tonka's four divisions since the Kenner Parker
acquisition was announced last fall, reducing total employment from
about 4,600 to about 3,975.
   Stephen Shank, Tonka's chairman and chief executive, said he
hoped Wednesday's action would put the company in a stable business
position.
   Tonka also announced Wednesday two Kenner executives will head a
new U.S. toy group within the company to oversee the autonomous
Kenner and Tonka divisions. David Mauer, 39, president and general
manager of Kenner in Cincinnati, will head the group, and Joseph
Fortino, 51, senior vice president of Kenner, will hold the same
position within the new group.

<HEAD>Central Bank Raises Key Lending Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank on
Thursday raised its Lombard lending rate to 5 percent in a bid to
bolster the mark, which has lost ground to other major currencies
in recent weeks.
   The Lombard rate had stood at 4.5 percent since Nov. 6, 1987.
   The mark has been falling against the U.S. dollar and the
British pound on foreign exchange markets. Analysts said the
Bundesbank's decision, which is effective Friday, was aimed at
supporting the mark and slowing the flow of capital out of West
Germany.
   ``With this measure, the Bundesbank is taking account of the
development of market interest rates and tensions in the currency
market,'' a Bundesbank spokesman said.
   The Lombard rate is the interest rate charged on banks'
short-term borrowings from the central bank against securities as
collateral.
   The Bundesbank left its discount rate unchanged at 3 percent,
which was set June 30 after a hike of 0.5 percent.
   The higher Lombard rate effectively lifts the ceiling on money
market rates, giving the Bundesbank room to directly tighten money
market rates further if the mark shows major signs of weakening,
analysts said.
   Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl has said the dollar's
advance against the mark endangers international efforts to adjust
trade imbalances in the United States, Japan and West Germany.
   Thursday's announcement follows Bundesbank decisions to raise
the rate on securities repurchase deals for commercial banks.
   That rate has been raised three times in the last six weeks by
.25 percent increments to its current 4 percent.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans slightly higher, corn
mostly lower and wheat narrowly mixed.
   The rebound in the soybean market indicated traders were picking
up contracts at what were seen as bargain prices after more than a
week of sharp declines, analysts said.
   ``People are bottom-picking, buying it on expectations that
because it's been down so far, it's bound to go up one of these
sessions,'' said Walter Spilka, grains analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   The early gains in the soybean pit occurred despite tne National
Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day forecast, which predicted
normal rainfall next week in most of the drought-stricken Midwest.
   The corn market appeared nervous about the possibility of a
further decline, and wheat traders were awaiting word of new export
business, Spilka said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 6 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.61 a bushel; corn was
2\ cents lower to 4{ cents higher with September at $2.77{ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with September at
$2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 4{ cents higher with August
at $7.58 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were sharply lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .47 cent lower with August at
66.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .35 cent
higher with August at 78.70 cents a pound; hogs were .52 cent to
1.05 cents lower with August at 44.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .27 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at
30.95 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher while pork futures finished mixed
on Wednesday.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Global Natural Resources Inc. said a former
executive who committed suicide last month misappropriated $75,000
in company assets for his own use.
   Company officials said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Wednesday that John R. Dempsey, former chief executive and
president, used Global money and equipment to build two barns, a
portable building and several ranch gates on his ranch near
Brenham, Texas.
   Dempsey also may have received a payment of $28,000 in
connection with the purchase by Global of some North Dakota oil and
gas properties, according to the filing.
   The filing said that if the company is unable to reach a
settlement with Dempsey's estate, it would bring civil charges to
try to recover the money.
   Dempsey, 53, quit his $281,599-a-year job in May. He fatally
shot himself June 20, 10 days after Global concluded an
investigation of his activities, according to the SEC document.
   Global will not be financially affected by Dempsey's actions,
the oil and natural gas company said in the filing, because it has
insurance. But Global still wants to recover what it can from
Dempsey's estate.

   Barclays PLC said Thursday it returned to
profitability in the first half of 1988 from a loss in the same
period a year ago when its results were hurt by additions to its
reserves against Third World loans.
   The bank said it had earnings in the six months ended June 30 of
393 million pounds, the equivalent of $684 million, or 43.3 pence a
share, compared with a loss of 72 million pounds in the same period
a year ago.
   Barclays made no additions to its reserves for Third World loans
in the latest period. It added 570 million pounds in the first half
of 1987.
   Revenue, including interest income, foreign exchange earnings
and commissions, increased 9 percent to 2.24 billion pounds from
2.06 billion pounds.
   Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., the company's investment bank,
increased its profit marginally to 27 million pounds from 25
million pounds a year earlier. The division lost 11 million pounds
in all of 1987 because of the stock market crash and start-up costs.
   The bank did not break out quarterly results. It is not required
to under British law.

<HEAD>Revco Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug store giant Revco D.S. Inc. said
today it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The filing includes Revco D.S., its parent company, ANAC Holding
Co., and most of its subsidiary corporations. Revco said Insta-Care
Pharmacy Services is not included in the filing.
   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Revco's 2,000 drugstores in 27 states will remain open and the
company's 28,000 employees will continue to be employed.
   ``Revco is in business to stay,'' Sells said. ``The stores are
open, employees have jobs and are being paid and customers can get
prescriptions filled as always.
   ``Although we had hoped to avoid this filing and restructure our
finances outside of the courts, we had warned of the possibility of
a voluntary filing for several months. Events of the last few days
left us with no viable alternative. This is a fight about who owns
Revco, not how Revco operates,'' Sells said.
   Revco was taken private in a leveraged buyout in late 1986. In a
leveraged buyout, those making the acquisition usually borrow
heavily against the cash flow or assets of the company being
acquired.
   The bankruptcy filing was necessary because holders of about
$400 million of the company's high-yielding bonds demanded
immediate payment of principal and $46 million in interest that the
company failed to pay as scheduled June 15, said Kathleen Obert,
Revco spokeswoman.
   She said under terms of the subordinated bonds, payment of the
principal is prohibited until the company's debt to senior lenders
is paid.
   Revco's total debt is about $1.5 billion and Obert said the
company filed for bankruptcy to be able to continue company
operations.
   ``The senior banks are saying you have to give us the debt first
and the subordinated want it first,'' Ms. Obert said. ``This is not
a liquidating bankruptcy, the stores are open and the normal
business operations are intact.''
   The filing allows Revco to obtain new credit and invoices for
goods and services, and requires the company to submit a
reorganization plan, restructuring the company's debt, to the
court, Obert said.
   With annual sales of $2.3 billion and 2,000 outlets, Revco
operates the nation's largest drug store chain, filling more than
65 million prescriptions each year.

   Coastal Corp. said its after-tax profit rose 37
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, boosted by gains
in all its areas of operation and reduction of its debt.
   The diversified energy company reported Thursday that its
second-quarter profit increased to $30.6 million, or 50 cents a
share, from $22.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 11.8 percent, to $1.9 billion from
$1.7 billion.
   The largest second-quarter increase was in the oil and gas
exploration and production segment, where earnings more than
doubled to $14.6 million from $7.1 million a year earlier. Coastal
said the increase was due largely to a favorable settlement of a
contested natural gas supply contract.
   The company's other operations include gas pipelines, oil
refining and marketing, coal and trucking.
   ``Coastal has reduced outstanding debt and preferred stock by
about $470 million to date this year and by a total of more than
$1.1 billion since the end of 1985, the year of the merger with
American Natural Resources,'' said James R. Paul, Coastal's
president and chief operating officer.
   In the first half of the year, Coastal's earnings rose to $77.1
million, or $1.35 a share, from $66.4 million, or $1.25 a share, a
year earlier. First-half revenue jumped to $4.2 billion from $3.6
billion.

<HEAD>Kerkorian-Sugarman Deal to Divvy Up MGM-UA is Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deal to recreate MGM and United
Artists as separate movie companies collapsed today, just two weeks
after it was struck, because financiers Kirk Kerkorian and Burt
Sugarman couldn't agree on terms.
   MGM-UA Communications Co., controlled by Kerkorian, was to have
been split into its original parts in a $400 million deal that
would have given Sugarman and two independent movie producers a
substantial share of a ``new'' Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
   Two weeks of extensive negotiations have failed to produce a
definitive agreement, said Stephen Silbert, MGM-UA chairman and
chief executive officer. Details of the talks between the two
financiers who share a fascination with Hollywood weren't released.
   The restructuring, which would have left Kerkorian in control of
a ``new'' United Artists and with a substantial share of the
resurrected MGM, was the latest in a series of shuffles the Las
Vegas, Nev., financier has made at the company.
   Analysts saw it as a means of raising funds to pay down the
debts of the company which produced the Oscar-winning movie
``Moonstruck'' and TV's ``thirtysomething,'' though much of the new
money would have come from Kerkorian himself.
   The complex shuffle, announced July 11, was to have been
accomplished through an offering of rights to MGM-UA shareholders
entitling them to buy shares in the new MGM.
   Sugarman, through his Barris Industries Inc., which makes ``The
Dating Game'' TV show, was to have bought 25 percent of the new
stock. Barris producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber would have run
the new company.
   Kerkorian and public shareholders of MGM-UA would have had the
right to buy the rest of the new issue of 50 million shares at $8 a
share.
   Of the $400 million raised, $300 million was to have gone back
into United Artists and $100 million to MGM.
   The new MGM, whose roaring lion trademark associated with such
classic movies as ``Gone With the Wind,'' would have had rights to
a batch of relatively new movies. But the company's original
3,000-title library was sold to broadcast entrepreneur Ted Turner
and the famed MGM movie lot was sold to Lorimar-Telepictures Corp.
in Kerkorian's last shuffle of the companies in 1986.
   United Artists' 1,000-title library includes the ``Rocky'' and
``Pink Panther'' movies.

<HEAD>Drought Aid Could Trip Gramm-Rudman Trigger, Administration Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration estimated today that
the federal deficit for the upcoming budget year would be $140.1
billion, $5.9 billion under the trigger for across-the-board
spending reductions. But budget director James Miller said too
large a drought-relief package could provoke the automatic cuts.
   The new deficit estimate, covering the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1, is $5.9 billion smaller than the $146 billion level that
would force cuts to kick-in under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget
law.
   But in presenting the estimate, Miller, head of the Office of
Management and Budget, warned that Congress must exercise spending
restraint in granting relief to farmers and in several other areas
or face the risk of triggering automatic spending cuts.
   ``We cannot do all those things. Congress has got to pare down
and make sure it does not go over the limit,'' Miller told
reporters at a White House briefing.
   Miller warned that drought-relief and other spending proposals
pending before Congress could push the deficit upward and trigger
the politically painful spending cuts, which would take effect just
before the November elections.
   The drought-relief measures now being considered in Congress are
estimated to cost $4.3 billion to $6.6 billion. The administration
wants to keep the drought package at $4 billion to $5 billion.
   The administration is also fighting to hold the spending line on
other measures currently before Congress. These include anti-drug
legislation, pending trade legislation and a supplemental spending
bill.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman act, the administration is required to
estimate the coming year's fiscal budget deficit by mid-August to
project whether across-the-board spending cuts will take effect.
   The White House budget office must then adjust that estimate in
October to take into account any new legislation.
   If such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount
of $146 billion, across-the-board spending cuts of more than $10
billion automatically take effect.
   The report today, known as a mid-session review, estimated that
the deficit in the current fiscal year would be $152.3 billion.
This estimate is still more optimistic than those of many private
forecasters and the Congressional Budget Office, which is
projecting a deficit of $157 billion for the current fiscal year.
   The 1987 budget deficit was $150.4 billion, down from the record
$221.1 billion deficit run up in 1986. The sharp reduction last
year occurred because of a one-time windfall in revenues generated
by a massive overhaul of the tax law.
   The revised deficit estimate for the current fiscal year of
$152.3 billion was up from the administration's February estimate
that the deficit this year would be $146.7 billion, which would
have made it lower than the 1987 imbalance.
   The administration blamed that higher deficit figure on
increased government spending in several areas. One of the biggest
over-runs occurred in the federal deposit insurance programs that
protect depositors at banks and savings and loans association.
   The budget review said that the insurance funds would pay out
$4.6 billion more this year than had been originally budgeted
because of high failure rates at banks and thrift institutions in
the depressed Southwest.
   The deficit target under the Gramm-Rudman legislation for the
upcoming fiscal year is $136 billion, but the legislation says
automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the government's deficit
projection is within $10 billion of that figure. Thus, for 1989,
any estimate below $146 billion would avoid the need for spending
cuts.
   If the cuts did take effect, half of the reductions would come
from the military and half from domestic spending programs.
However, 70 percent of the domestic budget, including such programs
as Social Security, has been declared off limits.
   Thus such programs as AIDS research and drug-law enforcement
would feel the brunt of a disproportionate share of any automatic
spending cut, the administration has warned.

<HEAD>FDIC Decision Expected on Fate of First RepublicBank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of First RepublicBank Corp. said federal
regulators could decide the fate of the financially troubled bank
holding company this week, but executives dismissed as speculation
rumors that the bank would be declared insolvent.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which rescued First
RepublicBank with a $1 billion loan in March, said Wednesday it was
considering all options to resolve the company's financial crisis.
An announcement could come Friday.
   Management of First RepublicBank, which had a net loss of $2.3
billion in the first six months of the year, is competing with
three outside bidders for control of the institution.
   But the FDIC could declare the company insolvent and run the
institution itself until a suitor is selected in a so-called
bridge-bank transaction.
   The FDIC received final proposals to buy First RepublicBank on
Monday from Citicorp of New York; NCNB Corp., a regional banking
company based in Charlotte, N.C.; and San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo & Co.
   First RepublicBank's management, led by Chairman Albert Casey,
submitted a plan to the FDIC to remain independent.
   In a memo to First RepublicBank managers Wednesday, the company
said it expected an FDIC decision by the weekend. Spokesman Joe
Bowles said the memo was prompted by speculation that a bridge
transaction was imminent.
   ``As the decision time grows near, we expect to see more of this
speculation,'' Bowles said.
   The FDIC would ultimately shoulder close to $2 billion of the
cost of any deal, FDIC Chairman Wiliam Seidman has said, including
an initial recapitalization of as much as $5 billion.
   Creation of a bridge bank would eliminate bondholder and
shareholder claims and nullify all current lawsuits against First
RepublicBank. The FDIC can control the bridge bank for up to two
years.

   A late rally pushed prices into positive territory
Thursday on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 0.5
point, or 0.03 percent, to close at 1,841.3.
   Volume rose to 494.3 million shares from 363.9 million shares
traded Wednesday.
   The market's attention was focused on speculative situations,
giving selected stocks a sharp boost, analysts said.
   The lack of strong interest on the part of fund managers to
enter the market, except in these special situations, also gave no
incentive for players to pile into new equity positions, they said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 1.9 points at 1,480.7
at the close.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.15 points to close at

   The stock market gained ground today after a
tentative opening as investors picked up blue chip and high-tech
issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 2,065.97
at midafternoon.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 8 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 issues up, 616
down and 536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 108.55 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The Dow firmed on the opening but flirted with negative
territory before heading higher. Market watchers cautioned,
however, that any spike upward is likely to be temporary.
   Traders said the market drew some support from comments by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the Fed has not
changed its view on the course of monetary policy. He also
suggested the dollar is at appropriate levels against key foreign
currencies.
   Gains in the marketplace were scattered, however. There was an
improvement in several blue-chip issues, and high-tech stocks rose
but failed to generate much momentum outside the sector.
   Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates.
``The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,''
one trader said.
   Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on
Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than
4 percent in the last quarter.
   ``The market can't mount any kind of sustainable move if you
have rates going against you,'' noted Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said the bond market has to stabilize on a longer term basis
before money pours back into stocks. But the credit market headed
lower again today after the Commerce Department reported that
Americans' personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer
spending jumped 1.0 percent during June.
   Analysts are likely view the big rise in spending as
inflationary because it places a strain on U.S. manufacturers who
are fighting to lower the trade deficit.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Interco soared 8\ to
67|. The company received a $64-a-share buyout offer from City
Capital Associates.
   McGraw-Hill was up 3\ at 65 amid rumors that the British firm
Pearson PLC might make a bid for the publisher.

<HEAD>Greyhound's Profit Up 51.5 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Corp. said its after-tax profit
jumped 51.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
boosted by improvement in all its operations except financial
services.
   The diversified company reported Thursday that its
second-quarter profit rose to $29.7 million, or 78 cents a share,
from $19.6 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Greyhound said its net income for the second quarter was
affected by a $768,000 charge representing its loss on early
retirement of debt by GLI Holding Co. Earnings in the year-earlier
quarter had been affected by a loss of $9 million from discontinued
insurance operations and by a special charge of $2.7 million
reflecting premiums paid on early retirement of debt.
   Second-quarter revenue was up 39.3 percent, to $854 million from
$613 million. The company said the increase resulted mainly from
its acquisition of Dobbs airline and airport service business in
November 1987 and its purchase of General Motors Corp.'s transit
bus and repair parts operations in mid-1987.
   In the first half of the year, Greyhound's profit declined to
$47.3 million, or $1.23 a share, from $53.3 million, or $1.35 a
share, a year earlier. First-half revenue rose to $1.6 billion from
$1.2 billion.
   John W. Teets, Greyhound's chairman and chief executive officer,
said all segments of the company have shown improvement in 1988,
except for the financial group _ where gains from sales of assets
this year have not matched the higher-than-normal 1987 levels.
   Second-quarter earnings of the financial group declined to $6.5
million from $7 million during the same period last year.
   The company's consumer products operations, primarily Dial
Corp., reported net income of $14.7 million for the second quarter,
up from $13.3 million a year earlier.
   The service group had earnings of $22.8 million, up from $15.3
million in the second quarter of 1987.
   The transportation-manufacturing group's profit rose to $7.8
million from $6 million a year earlier.

   The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that a
string of popular movies and free spending by theme park patrons
helped boost its profit for the latest quarter by 29 percent from a
year ago.
   Disney said it earned $165 million, or $1.20 a share, in its
third fiscal quarter ended June 30 from $128.4 million, or 93 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales rose 22 percent to $915.7 million from
$751.2 million in the third quarter of 1987.
   Disney continued to score box office successes, with ``Three Men
and a Baby'' and ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' adding to a 46 percent
increase in sales in the company's movie division.
   Sales at Disneyland and Disney World theme parks, which
contribute the bulk of the company's revenue, were up 12 percent in
the quarter, though attendance was lower than last year, Disney
said. Higher per-capita guest spending accounted for the increase,
said the company, which doesn't reveal specific visitor headcounts.
   Sales continued to increase in the new consumer products
division as the company continued to open stores selling Disney
paraphenalia.
   For the first nine months of 1988, profit rose 25 percent, to
$385.6 million, or $2.81 a share, from $309.4 million, or $2.25 a
share, a year ago.
   Nine-month sales rose 14.3 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.1
billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<TEXT>
   Meredith Corp. said Thursday its
earnings fell 19.4 percent in its fourth quarter from a year ago,
reflecting weaker magazine profits, but that profit increased 39.6
percent for the full fiscal year, in large part because of
accounting changes.
   The diversified media company reported profit in the fourth
quarter ended June 30 fell to $6.7 million, or 35 cents a share,
from $8.4 million, or 43 cents a share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Its revenue rose 23.2 percent to $194.1 million in the quarter
from $157.5 million a year earlier.
   Meredith Chairman Robert Burnett attributed the reduced earnings
to declines in the company's magazine and broadcasting operations,
despite gains from real estate ventures and a lower effective
income tax rate.
   ``Weaker magazine profits in the fourth quarter reflect
substantial increases in paper and postage costs and our March
acquisition of Craftways Corp.,'' Burnett said in a statement
releasing Meredith's financial results.
   For the entire fiscal year, profit rose to $47.4 million, or
$2.48 a share, from $33.9 million, or $1.77 a share, in the
previous year.
   Without accounting changes, net profit would have been up 7.7
percent at $36.6 million, or $1.91 a share. However, profits from
business operations fell 6.4 percent in the latest fiscal year to
$36.6 million from $39 million.
   Burnett attributed the drop in operating earnings in part to
declines in Meredith's television broadcasting, because of higher
programming costs, and from residential real estate operations,
because of low market values on houses acquired under a government
relocation contract that no longer is in effect.
   Earnings benefited from a lower effective income tax rate and
lower interest expenses.
   Meredith publishes books and magazines, including Better Homes
and Gardens, and has interests in commercial printing, television
and residential real estate marketing and franchising.

   International Multifoods Corp. said Thursday
it has agreed to buy Bakers Choice, a California-based bakery
distributor, for an undisclosed amount.
   The acquisition of Bakers Choice, which is the bakery
distribution business of O' So Fresh Foods and Johnson Brothers Egg
Ranches Inc., is expected to be completed by the end of August, the
company said in a statement.
   Bakers Choice, based in Ontario, Calif., distributes ingredients
and supplies to in-store bakeries in the southern California
market. It offers a line of more than 2,500 items, including bakery
mixes, frozen prepared doughs for breads and other baked goods, to
about 700 customers, among them supermarket chains.
   The nine-year-old company had sales of $26 million in fiscal
1987.
   Joseph P. Famalette, Multifoods division vice president and
general manager, Bakery Products, said the acquisition ``fills a
vital gap in our distribution and makes us a truly national bakery
products business.''
   Bakers Choice, which employs about 70 people, operates a
distribution center in Ontario and owns 15 trucks.
   International Multifoods, with fiscal 1988 worldwide net sales
of $1.7 billion, is a diversified food company with major
operations in the United States, Canada and Venezuela.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported Thursday that
its second-quarter earnings fell 27.5 percent from a year ago,
citing higher aircraft development and production costs and wider
losses in its information systems segment.
   The defense contractor said it earned $70.4 million, or $1.83 a
share, in the second quarter compared with $97.1 million, or $2.39
a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue slipped 1.4 percent to $3.48 billion from
$3.53 billion for the second quarter last year.
   For the first half of the year, net earnings fell 12.9 percent
to $121.6 million, or $3.16 a share, compared with net earnings of
$140.1 million, or $3.45 a share,
   Six-month revenue rose 2.3 percent to $6.72 billion from $6.57
billion for the first half of last year.
   The company said the earnings decline in both periods resulted
from higher development costs for the U.S. Air Force's Advanced
Tactical fighter competition and the new MD-11 tri-jet, higher
production costs in major aircraft programs and increased losses in
the information systems segment.
   It said higher interest expenses were offset in part by lower
income taxes, which declined because of lower tax rates.
   The 1987 earnings had been affected by several unusual items,
including a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $66 million to cover
the cost of an early retirement program. In addition, results for
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Co. in 1987 included a gain
of $15 million before taxes from the sale of about half of the
corporation's interest in a computer services company.
   The company also said 1987 earnings were positively affected by
a pre-tax gain of $38 million from the conversion to long-term
leases of MD-80 jetliners previously leased on a short-term basis.
A similar conversion in the first quarter of 1988 produced a
pre-tax gain of $21 million.

   The stock market narrowly gained ground today as
investors snapped up blue chip and high tech issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.34 at 2,075.04
an hour before the closing bell.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 13 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 814 issues up, 572
down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 129.03 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The market's opening was tentative as the Dow flirted with
negative territory before heading higher as bargain-hunters moved
in to buy selected stocks. A firming bond market also helped
support stock prices.
   The market's scattered gains centered on blue chip, high tech
and takeover stocks. A better-than-expected quarterly earnings
report from Digital Equipment served to support technology issues,
while the publishing sector got a boost from takeover rumors
surrounding McGraw-Hill, analysts said.
   Market watchers cautioned, however, that investors are largely
uncommitted to equities.
   ``There's an enormous amount of cash on the sidelines,'' said
Michael Metz, a vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer
& Co.
   ``Investors are waiting for some signal that interest rates have
peaked or that the market is going up anyway before they really get
aggressive,'' he said.
   Traders said the market drew some support from comments by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the Fed has not
changed its view on the course of monetary policy. He also
suggested the dollar is at appropriate levels against key foreign
currencies.
   Analysts noted that investors' key focus is interest rates.
``The market seems to be suffering from interest-rate paranoia,''
one trader said.
   Concern that rates might be moving upward heightened on
Wednesday when the goverment reported that inflation rose more than
4 percent in the last quarter.
   ``The market can't mount any kind of sustainable move if you
have rates going against you,'' noted Larry Wachtel, first vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that Americans'
personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer spending jumped
1.0 percent during June. Analysts are likely view the big rise in
spending as inflationary because it places a strain on U.S.
manufacturers who are fighting to lower the trade deficit.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Interco soared 8[ to
67{. The company received a $64-a-share buyout offer from City
Capital Associates.
   McGraw-Hill was up 4 at 65} amid rumors that the British firm
Pearson PLC might make a bid for the publisher.
   Elsewhere, Digital Equipment rose 2{ to 104}; the company
reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. IBM, which
announced price increases on most of its products and services,
rose 1~ to 123; Polaroid was up 1\ at 43{, and Hewlett Packard was
up } at 49[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.34 to 150.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.38 at 303.23.

   International Business Machines Co. announced
Thursday that it is raising prices for many of its older products
and related services, excluding its newest computer models from the
change.
   IBM said prices will increase 5 percent on most products and
services, while maintenance agreement charges will go up 3 percent.
   Excluded from the price increases are the new IBM 3090-S models,
introduced earlier this week, as well as the new Application
System-400 and the Personal System-2 and RT system computers.
   ``The most important products are excluded,'' said Jay P.
Stevens, an analysts at the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Most analysts said the changes reflect the higher costs of
developing new computers and an effort by IBM to steer customers
toward its newer products.
   ``IBM does this occasionally, raising prices in certain areas,''
said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst with Argus Research.
   Analysts said IBM's newest products already have the costs built
into their prices.
   However, some said the move could signal industrywide increases.
   ``It sets the tone for the computer industry that margins are
under pressure in some sectors of some industries,'' Stevens said.
   IBM did not announce any increases for its European subsidiaries
but said IBM Canada and 15 of its subsidiaries in the Asia-Pacific
Group, excluding Japan, Korea and Taiwan, announced similar
increases Thursday.

<HEAD>SnyderGeneral Withdraws York Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   York International Inc. reaffirmed on Thursday
its support for an investor group's $750 million buyout offer after
a competing bidder withdrew its $795 million buyout proposal amid
government antitrust concerns.
   York, a heating and air-conditioning equipment manufacturer,
said SnyderGeneral Corp., a privately-held concern based in Dallas,
notified York by letter that it was withdrawing its bid.
   York said its board had decided it was not in the interest of
York stockholders to pursue further discussions or negotiations
with SnyderGeneral.
   Instead, it reaffirmed its support for a tender offer by a
subsidairy of the investor group York Holdings Corp. for up to 9.19
million shares, or 87.8 percent of York's shares, at $57.50 per
share expires at midnight Friday unless extended.
   York Holdings' bid is backed by the venture-capital unit of
Citicorp, the huge banking concern.
   SnyderGeneral spokeswoman Michelle Pavlik said her company had
no comment, and said company president Richard Snyder was not
immediately available.
   According to York International, SnyderGeneral's letter
withdrawing the buyout offer said the antitrust division of the
U.S. Department of Justice ``raised new concerns late yesterday as
to product overlap between York and SnyderGeneral other than
centrifugal and reciprocating chillers.''
   ``If the Antitrust Division were to require a divestiture with
respect to this particular product line, we would not be willing to
consummate the acquisition of York,'' the letter said, according to
York.
   The letter added that SnyderGeneral planned to keep talking with
the Justice Department and said ``if we obtain a satisfactory
resolution as to these new concerns, we intend to reinstate our
offer.''
   But York subsequently released a statement that said:
``Particularly in light of recent developments, most notably
SnyderGeneral's last-minute withdrawal of its latest proposal, the
York board reaffirms it support of the York Holdings transaction
scheduled to close tomorrow.''
   York's statement indicates the company considers SnyderGeneral
out of the picture, York spokesman Patrick Early said.
   On Wednesday, York International said its board failed to meet a
noon deadline that day to respond to a revised buyout proposal from
SnyderGeneral.
   SnyderGeneral had requested consent Tuesday to modify its $795
million proposal under which York shareholders would receive $61
per share.
   The action came after York International announced the Justice
Department investigation of whether the proposed merger violated
antitrust rules.
   York International was a unit of Borg-Warner Corp. until it was
spun off and went public two years ago.
   SnyderGeneral is a privately held company that employs about
4,800 people at nine facilities.

   The stock market strengthened Thursday in a
technical rally led by blue-chip and high technology issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.63 to close at
2,082.33, erasing a 20-point drop in the previous session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by roughly a 5-to-3 ratio
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 884 up, 531 down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.57 million
shares, against 135.89 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 177.72 million shares.
   The market opened on a tentative note as the Dow average flirted
with negative territory. But analysts said the market was poised
for a technical rebound.
   ``In the last several days the broader market was doing better
than the Dow,'' which had reached the low end of its recent trading
range, said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``That was a precondition for a technical
bounce,'' he added.
   The market's gains centered on blue chip, high tech and takeover
stocks. A better-than-expected quarterly earnings report from
Digital Equipment served to support technology issues, while the
publishing sector got a boost from takeover rumors surrounding
McGraw-Hill, analysts said.
   Strategies to capture quarterly dividends also accounted for a
fair share of the day's volume.
   Market watchers cautioned, however, that investors are largely
uncommitted to equities. ``There's an enormous amount of cash on
the sidelines,'' said Michael Metz, a vice president and technical
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   Analysts were not entirely optimistic that Thursday's upward
spike would be sustained.
   ``We'll have to wait and see,'' Goldman said. ``The bears showed
what they could do last week and took the market down, now its the
bulls' turn to strut their stuff and see if they can take it up.''
   Traders said the market drew support from comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the Fed has not changed
its view on monetary policy. He also suggested the dollar is at
appropriate levels against key foreign currencies.
   In other economic news, the Commerce Department said Americans'
personal incomes rose 0.7 percent while consumer spending jumped
1.0 percent in June. Analysts were likely to view the big rise in
spending as inflationary because it strains the capacity of U.S.
manufacturers.
   ``Investors are waiting for some signal that interest rates have
peaked or that the market is going up anyway before they really get
aggressive,'' Metz said.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Interco soared 8] to

Capital Associates.
   McGraw-Hill was up 4\ at 66 amid rumors that the British firm

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was up 1.66 at 150.40.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials advanced 4.15 to

   Drought may take a bite out of the income of
many farmers, but the hot, dry weather isn't expected to cut back
on their spending for many production items this year, an
Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   ``The drought is expected to have little impact on 1988
expenditures for seed, fertilizer and pesticides because most of
these ... were applied at or before planting,'' the report said.
``Farm machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in
1988 but could be slowed by the drought.''
   Spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be
affected significantly by the drought, however.
   ``Energy expenditures for irrigation will be up, but likely will
be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and
drying,'' the report said, a grim reminder that reduced yields _ or
none at all _ mean it will cost less to run grain combines and
dryers.
   Farmers spending on machinery increased $1.2 billion to $5.8
billion in 1987, ending seven years of decline, the report said.
   Net cash income of farmers _ the difference between gross cash
receipts and cash expenses _ rose to a record $56 billion in
calendar 1987. Current USDA forecasts put 1988 net cash income at
$53 billion to $59 billion.

   Thousands of migrant workers are stranded in
the Midwest and don't have enough money to return home because the
drought has robbed them of a living, a Texas lawmaker said Thursday
in seeking federal assistance.
   Democratic Rep. Albert Bustamante, in a letter asking Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin for emergency aid, said many migrants are
in a desperate situation ``we can no longer continue to ignore.''
   Labor Department spokesman Bob Zachariasiewicz said the agency
``has a plan of action'' but it won't be unveiled until Mrs.
McLaughlin, who is overseas, gives it her final approval. An
announcement will be made next week.
   An administration source said the package would total $4 million
to $5 million, but ``the final distribution is just not set on
paper yet.'' The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In his letter to Mrs. McLaughlin, Bustamante said: ``Migrant
workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested
their personal savings to search for field work. Drought conditions
have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their
financial losses.
   ``Because the president's emergency relief program is directed
solely at the farmer level, migrant workers and their families have
no safety net to relieve their conditions. Measures taken to date
have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks.''
   Bustamante, a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and
grandson of Mexican-Americans who followed the crops, said he still
has relatives who travel from Texas to Minnesota to harvest sugar
beets.
   He estimates the stranded migrant and seasonal worker population
at about 10,000, but said it is difficult to get a true figure.
   Bustamante said most of the migrants are U.S. citizens, and most
are from along the Texas border.
   ``Exhaused of their personal financial resources, they have no
money for temporary shelter and food,'' he wrote. ``Many would like
to return home, but they cannot. They are broke, indebeted,
stranded and dependent on the kindness and charity of local
efforts.''
   He said he is seeking funds to provide shelter, food and
job-search assistance to migrants who want to stay in the Midwest
to help farmers salvage crops, and to give others who want to
return home money for travel.

   Wheat farmers will still have to idle 10
percent of their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price
supports, despite the severe drought that has hit some producing
areas this year, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced
Thursday.
   Lyng, who was out of town, said in a statement that the 10
percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on May 25,
under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the
following year's crop prior to June 1. That was before the drought
became so widespread and severe.
   ``Even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production,
especially that of spring wheat, the prospective supply-demand
balance (for the coming year) does not call for a change in the
previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989,''
Lyng said.
   A crop projection issued on July 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at
1.84 billion bushels, down from 2.12 billion bushels forecast in
June. The 1987 harvest was about 2.1 billion bushels.
   But U.S. wheat inventories have been large, despite a heavy
export drain, and totaled around 1.27 billion bushels on June 1,
the beginning of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year. The smaller
harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to
around 666 million bushels by June 1, 1989, according to the
projections.
   Earlier, the June 1, 1989, wheat carryover was forecast at 781
million bushels.
   Winter wheat, which comprises about three-fourths of the U.S.
total, will be planted this fall for harvest next year. Spring
wheat, including durum used for pasta, is produced farther north
and bore the brunt of this summer's drought damage to the wheat
crop.

   The White House, in a move that could lead to
a weakening of President Reagan's ``New Federalism'' campaign, will
study whether the federal government should act more aggressively
to supersede some state and local laws, an administration official
said Thursday.
   That was the upshot of a meeting by President Reagan's Domestic
Policy Council, which discussed the specific question of whether
California's Proposition 65 food-labeling requirement hampers
interstate commerce and thus should be overtaken by federal
regulation.
   It's one of the toughest consumer-oriented regulations in the
country, requiring warnings on any food products suspected of
presenting a risk for birth defects or cancer.
   During his more than 7{ years as president, Reagan has advocated
a ``New Federalism'' policy aimed at relinquishing some of
Washington's regulatory powers to states and local governments.
   An executive order aimed at instituting this policy contains
language suggesting intervention by Washington under certain
circumstances, however.
   An administration official said no decision was reached at
Thursday's meeting on whether to interfere with state and local
laws and regulations requiring warnings on food packages.
   Instead, this official said, a White House working group was set
up to consider the matter. This group would include representatives
of such agencies as the Agriculture Department, the Department of
Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.
   The official, discussing the meeting on grounds of anonymity,
said the central question before the interagency working group is
when and under what circumstances the federal government should act
if it concludes that a state or local regulation harms interstate
commerce.
   Among other things, the study group will try to determine
whether Proposition 65, enacted by voters in 1986, duplicates or
conflicts with the federal Food and Drug Act.
   Food industry officials who have criticized the state standards
as unnecessary and costly, and they hailed the action as a victory.
   ``We think this is the formal beginning of a major policy
review,'' said Jeffrey Nedelman, vice president for public affairs
for the Grocery Manufacturers Association. ``We think we have a
crazy situation on our hands, and before it gets really crazy, the
government is going to take a real look at the problem.''
   But environmental advocates in California condemned the
council's decision.
   ``This is a clear industry-orchestrated sneak attack directly on
Proposition 65,'' said David Roe, an attorney for the Environmental
Defense Fund and a principal author of the California initiative.
   The proposition, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement
Act of 1986, requires that companies give California consumers a
``clear and reasonable warning'' if a product contains a chemical
that poses ``a significant risk'' to their health.
   A variety of industries, including gasoline service stations,
convenience stores and chemical plants, have posted warnings about
the presence of chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects.
   The state, however, has granted a temporary exemption from the
warning requirements for food products, drugs and cosmetics that
already meet existing federal and state safety standards.
   The state will analyze more than 50 chemicals that could be
found in these products during the next two years to determine
whether warnings should be required under Proposition 65.
   Food industry officials contend none of their products pose a
danger to consumers.
   But they say they fear Proposition 65 may lead to putting
warning labels on food packages to alert consumers to the presence
of lead, arsenic or benzene, substances that are present in minute
quantities in many common products.

   The dollar rose against major currencies
Thursday, led by strong demand in Europe and boosted by word from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that a stronger dollar
would not help the U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted gold at a bid of $432.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from $433.45 late Wednesday. Analysts said the dollar started
sluggish, but gained strength in Europe and continued strong
throughout the day.
   The dollar got a spark from Greenspan's testimony before a
congressional subcommittee that the central bank was likely to
tighten rather than loosen credit, which would tend to support the
dollar.
   Analysts said Greenspan's reiteration of the Fed's stance helped
strengthen the dollar, due to speculation that interest rates could
move higher, increasing the value of dollar-denominated investments.
   ``Interest rates domestically are going up. That is reflected in
the bond market,'' said Jack Barbanel, first vice president at
Gruntal & Co. ``And the dollar is starting to get its strength back
again.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 132.10. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 132.35 yen. In New York, the dollar
rose to 132.55 yen from 131.63 late Wednesday.
   The British pound fell against the dollar. In London, sterling
was quoted at $1.7225, compared with $1.7265 Wednesday, while in

   Merger and acquisition activity increased
steadily during the first six months of 1988 while the dollar value
of completed deals jumped 45 percent from a year ago, a financial
information firm reported Thursday.
   IDD Information Services said that 1,705 transactions were
completed in the first two quarters, up from 1,622 in the first
half of 1987.
   More impressive, perhaps, was that the deals this year carried a
pricetag of $131 billion, up from $89.5 billion in the year-ago
period, the firm said.
   Foreign investors snapped up U.S. companies at a rapid pace,
spending $25 billion on acquisitions in the first half of this
year, up 67 percent from $15 billion in 1987.
   IDD attributed the interest _ led by Canada, Japan and Great
Britain _ to a weaker dollar.
   Despite predictions of a decrease in activity following the
October market crash, leveraged buyouts moved along at a brisk
clip. In the first half of the year, IDD said there were 77
leveraged buyouts with a total value of $30 billion, compared with
58 buyouts valued at $20 billion a year ago.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow against a target
company's assets and repay borrowed funds from the company's cash
flow.
   The use of tender offers as a way to acquire companies also
increased dramatically. IDD said such transactions were valued at
$75.9 billion, compared with $35.3 billion in tender offers a year
ago.
   In terms of number of transactions completed, Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. led the pack of major investment houses by acting as
financial advisor in 92 deals; followed by Goldman Sachs & Co. with
77 and First Boston Corp. with 70.
   Based on dollar value, however, Goldman Sachs was No. 1,
representing $41.72 billion in completed transactions, followed by
Shearson Lehman, $40.4 billion, and First Boston, $34.1 billion.
   IDD Information Services, headquartered in New York, supplies
the merger and acquisition information to financial and legal
clients.

   Assets of the nation's 445 money market mutual
funds fell $330.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $266.35 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $344.6 million increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds rose $278.3 million to $83.21
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds dropped $68.2 million to
$114.4 billion, and assets of 124 institutional funds declined
$540.3 million to $68.74 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.91 percent from 6.81 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.77 percent from 6.70 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.81 percent as of Wednesday from 5.79 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from a week earlier at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.33
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.28 the
previous week. Yields were 7.62 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.58
percent; 7.98 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.93 percent; and
8.35 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.32 percent.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move in Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions during the week ended July 20,
the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,023.6 billion in the week ended July 20 from $3,027.4
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,819.8 billion from $3,817.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.4 billion from $784.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $891 million,
compared with a decline of $423 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said discount window
borrowings averaged $710 million, up from $500 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $281.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $278.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   Chrysler Corp. reported Thursday that its
second-quarter earnings slid 24.5 percent compared with a year ago,
and analysts said buyer incentive programs may have compressed
results more than the company expected.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker said it earned $320.4 million, or
$1.45 per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with
$424.1 million, or $1.98 per share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   The depressed profits due to rebate and incentives programs were
a short-term sacrifice to boost market share and improve the
company's long-term competitiveness, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
said.
   That game plan led to brisk sales, which should strengthen
Chrysler's standing in the marketplace, Iacocca said.
   ``You get a conquest (first time) buyer into your stable and
hopefully you keep him,'' explained Joseph Phillippi, auto analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The results came on sales of nearly $8.5 billion in the second
quarter, up 32.8 percent from $6.4 billion in the same period a
year ago.
   ``The profit margins were very poor considering the level of
business they did in the quarter,'' said analyst Dave Healy of
Drexel Burnham Lambert of New York. ``They have been pushing
heavily with incentives and the market share's gone up, but the
results show the effect of it.''
   ``They were a little bit under where they were going to come in
(under the forecast),'' Phillippi said. ``The principal reason,
essentially as I read the number, was average yields per unit were
down a little bit, and that reflects fleet sales, the cost of
rebates and incentives... It was essentially the incentives.''
   Chrysler's 20.7 percent share of the U.S. truck market was up
nearly two percentage points from the second quarter of 1987, the
company said.
   Through June, Chrysler's combined U.S. car and truck retail
sales were up 16 percent from the same period of 1987.
   ``We're going after a bigger base of loyal customers, because
that's what it takes to succeed over the long haul,'' Iacocca said.
   For the first half of the year, Chrysler's net earnings totaled
$504.1 million, or $2.27 per share, down from $693.5 million, or
$3.22 per share.
   The first half results include a $93.1 million charge for
previously announced plant closings in the Acustar Inc. subsidiary.
   First-half sales rose 30.6 percent to $16.16 billion from $12.44
billion a year earlier.
   During the second quarter, the nation's No. 3 automaker
continued to hold the line on 1988 model prices, with 42 percent of
the passenger cars it sells tagged below 1987 prices.
   ``That's paid off for us in higher market share, but we're
caught in a classic case of `margin squeeze,' and we can't rely on
that strategy forever,'' Iacocca said.
   ``We have seen that the incentives, in terms of rebates, have
been coming steadily down for about six months,'' Phillippi said.
``The basic game plan, I think, in a sense among the executives at
the three large companies, is to launch the new models without any
meaningful incentives.''
   On Wednesday, Chrysler announced a small price increase on the
Colt GT for 1989, but said it would lower prices on two other Colt
models.
   Chrysler Financial Corp., Chrysler's credit arm, made record
earnings on the increased sales volume, reporting profits of $61
million for the second quarter of 1988 and $126 million for the
first six months of the year, the subsidiary announced today.
   The results eclipse the previous quarterly high of $56 million,
set in the second quarter of 1987, and a six-month earnings record
of $117 million, also set a year ago, a company statement said.
   On Wednesday, No. 2 Ford Motor Co. reported an auto industry
record second quarter, earning $1.66 billion, up from $1.50 billion
in the second quarter of 1987. General Motors Corp., the world's
largest manufacturer, last week reported its second-quarter
earnings _ $1.5 billion, compared with $1.17 billion in the
comparable period of 1987.

   Corn and sugar futures prices fell sharply Thursday in trading
that analysts said was inspired by technical conditions and had
little to do with fundamental supply-and-demand factors.
   Most wheat and soybean futures also slipped lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, and coffee futures joined sugar in falling for a
third straight day on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   On other markets, precious metals were lower; cattle were up
while pork futures plunged; and energy futures were mixed.
   Thursday marked the fifth consecutive day of falling corn
futures prices and the ninth straight daily drop in the price for
August delivery of soybeans.
   But in a departure from the past three months, the weather had
little impact on the markets, analysts said.
   Instead, they said corn traders were watching their market's
open interest, a rough measure of the number of speculators who
have _ in effect _ placed their bets but not collected their
winnings.
   Open interest has been running at an unusually high level in the
corn market and stood at more than 244,000 contracts when the
market opened Thursday.
   The majority of the open interest was believed to represent
``long'' positions, or wagers that prices would rise. Since prices
have been falling, some players feared that many holders of those
long positions were preparing to sell and either cut their losses
or settle for only a slight profit.
   A sudden, massive sell-off would cause prices to plummet and
some traders tried to beat the rush by selling ahead of it, which
caused corn prices to fall sharply anyway.
   The selling sentiment spread to the neighboring wheat and
soybean pits, causing prices to fall in those markets, too, said
Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   The National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day forecast,
calling for normal rainfall next week in the drought-stricken
Midwest, was bearish but it was not a major factor in Thursday's
action, Spilka said.
   ``I think weather forecasts are maybe contributing about half
the influence right now (and) I think near-term forecasts are more
important than the 6-to-10-days,'' he said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.57 a bushel; corn was 14} cents lower
to 2 cents higher with September at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 3
cents lower to 7{ cents higher with September at $2.56{ a bushel;
and soybeans were 12 cents lower to 15 cents higher with August at
$7.41{ a bushel.
   The situation was similar in the sugar market, which ignored the
bullish news of new sugar purchases by China and plummeted to its
lowest level in about a month.
   ``This was a technically driven sell-off,'' said Judith Ganes,
sugar analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Sugar futures have been extremely strong and stood at 6{-year
highs on Monday. Ms. Ganes said the market fundamentals remained
bullish and that the nearly 3{-cent plunge over three days ``just
gives you better bargains.''
   Sugar for October delivery settled .53 cent lower at 10.82 cents
a pound.
   Coffee futures continued their technically-driven decline with
the September contract settling .26 cent lower at $1.2379 a pound.
   The continuing decline in the grain markets forced some
speculators with additional holdings in silver and platinum futures
to take profits in the metals markets so they could meet their
financial obligations in the grain markets, said Bette Raptopoulos,
an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Gold was more stable in its traditional role as a ``safe haven''
for investment dollars, she said.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 70 cents to $1
lower with August at $432.50 a troy ounce; silver was 25.8 cents to
29.6 cents lower with August at $6.707 a troy ounce.
   Hog and pork-belly futures fell their respective daily limits of
1.50 cents and 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
because ``there's too much supply and not enough demand, period,''
said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Cattle futures followed the grains to a mixed close, Levitt said.
   Live cattle were .87 cent lower to .33 cent higher with August
at 66.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .93
cent higher with August at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.12
cents to 1.50 cents lower with August at 43.87 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with August at
30.95 cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices were little changed in quiet trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as traders waited for an upcoming OPEC
committee meeting.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 2 cents lower
with September at $16.15 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .69
cent lower with August at 44.34 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .11 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with August at 51.95 cents
a gallon.

<HEAD>P&O Agrees to Buy Sitmar Cruises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Co.
said Thursday it will acquire U.S.-based Sitmar Cruises
International Inc. for $210 million in a bid to boost the British
company's luxury cruise operations.
   The purchase gives P and O control of Sitmar's Los Angeles-based
fleet of four cruise ships and three large cruise ships currently
under construction. Sitmar is privately owned by U.S. and European
investors.
   P and O subsidiary Princess Cruises has a five-ship fleet, also
based in Los Angeles.
   P and O Chairman Sir Jeffrey Sterling said the combined fleets
should make a strong contribution to the group's earnings once the
new Sitmar ships are added in the early 1990s.
   The cruise ship operations are part of P and O's passenger
service division, which Sterling said contributed 47 million
pounds, or $82 million, to total 1987 operating profit of 328
million pounds, or $571 million.
   Sterling said Sitmar is profitable, but P and O did not provide
any figures.

<TEXT>
   Both houses of Congress overwhelmingly
approved some $6 billion in aid for drought-stricken farmers
Thursday after scaling back provisions for special assistance to
milk producers and ethanol fuel makers.
   ``Hold on _ help is coming in a sensible, rational compassionate
way,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, said as the House gave 368-29 approval to its version of
the bill.
   Within hours, the Senate approved 94-0 a similar bill but only
after peppering it with scores of complex changes that may not be
untangled before a House-Senate conference committee next week, at
which lawmakers plan to fashion the final version.
   Congressional leaders aim to send the final product to President
Reagan's desk by Aug. 11.
   The House had come under fire over a provision that would have
increased on Oct. 1 the price-support level for milk to $11.10 for
each 100 pounds. It would raise consumer costs by a few cents a
gallon at most and cost the government $145 million by
congressional estimate. The Agriculture Department put the price
tag at $300 million.
   Both the House and Senate versions would cancel a 50-cent
price-support cut set for Jan. 1 and the plan to actually increase
the level was denounced by Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng as
well as an array of business and farm groups that often are allies
of the dairy industry on such matters.
   ``This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' said
Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. He scoffed at claims that dairymen need
the price increase to offset the increased cost of feed resulting
from the drought, saying cattle and sheep ranchers and poultry
producers are not getting anything similar in the way of a subsidy.
   The House moved to deflect criticism, adopting a compromise
version sponsored by Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and Tim Penny,
D-Minn. It would go ahead with the increase but only for April
through June next year. Supporters said it would knock $30 million
off the price tag.
   In the Senate, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., scaled back his plan to
allow U.S. ethanol fuel makers to buy up to 2 million bushels each
every month of government surplus corn. Ethanol is a fuel based
partly on alcohol produced from corn and other commodities.
   Under Daschle's plan, ethanol makers would be able to purchase
the corn at 110 percent of the government's acquisition price. Much
of the corn in Agriculture Department bins now was acquired long
before the drought sent crop prices skyrocketing.
   The South Dakotan said he designed the provision to help small
ethanol makers, but it could represent a substantial benefit for
the the Archer Daniels Midland Co., the large Decatur, Ill., corn
processing company that makes the lion's share of U.S. ethanol.
   In any case, Daschle won voice vote approval of an alteration
that would terminate the program next Sept. 1 and limit the total
use of corn in the program to 16 million bushels a month.
   Basic provisions of the bill would provide payments to
drought-stricken farmers equal to 65 percent of their lost earnings
above 35 percent of anticipated harvest. They also would expand and
streamline government feed programs for dairy and livestock
producers.
   Lawmakers have been struggling to keep their plan within tight
budgetary limits and there has been concern about the possibility
of excess spending within the bill.
   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., took to the House floor to denounce a
$5.5 million project to control temperatures in the Sacremento
River near Shasta Dam and thus aid salmon spawning as ``this pork
garbage.''
   De la Garza defended the measure sponsored by Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., as one that would help to provide an adequate
food supply to American consumers. He said the measure was not
merely to help farmers but to make certain that there was enough to
eat on the grocery shelf.
   The House also approved a de la Garza amendment that would bring
the cost estimate for the bill to $5.8 billion, down from $6.9
billion at the start of the day. Most of the decrease was accounted
for by new limits on a program under which the government could pay
half the cost of seeding burned out pastures.
   The measure sponsored by Rep. Claude Harris, D-Ala., was
harnessed to the bill when the Agriculture Committee was racing to
wrap up work and later estimated to have a $1.2 billion cost.
   De la Garza's amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by
shrinking the seeding provision.
   Even then, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, acknowledged
Thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of
exactly how much the drought bill would cost. Farm lawmakers have
been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level
have nothing to complain about because it would be less than
federal savings realized because of the drought.
   But Wright said there was no certainty.
   ``The art of economics is not a precise one,'' Wright said.

<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines and the parent of United Airlines on Thursday
said their after-tax profit rose strongly in the latest quarter
from a year earlier, boosted by revenue gains generated by growth
in passenger traffic.
   UAL Corp., the parent of United, the nation's largest airline,
reported a 134 percent jump in second-quarter profit. Its earnings
advanced to $124.2 million, or $5.77 a share.
   The profits surged past last year's second-quarter airline
earnings of $53 million. The company actually earned a total of
$73.4 million, or $1.29 a share, during 1987's second quarter, but
that figure included profits from nonairline subsidiaries it has
since sold.
   The number of UAL shares outstanding was sharply reduced during
the period, to around 21.5 million in the second quarter of 1988
from 56.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   Second-quarter revenue rose to $2.34 billion from $2.07 billion
a year earlier.
   Early this year, Chicago-based UAL completed the sale of its
non-airline assets _ the Hertz car rental agency and the Westin and
Hilton International hotel chains. It changed its name from Allegis
Corp., which had been intended to signify its former status as a
travel conglomerate.
   ``These results make it clear that United has returned to its
core business of running an airline and doing so with the talent of
63,000 committed employees,'' said Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who
took over the company last December following the ouster of former
chief Richard Ferris.
   In the first half of the year, UAL's profit surged to $701
million, or $19.12 a share, from $42.8 million, or 79 cents a
share, a year earlier. Earnings in the 1988 first half include a
$548 million gain from the sale of Westin Hotels.
   The number of shares outstanding dropped to around 36.6 million
in the first six months of 1988 from 54.0 million in the same
period of 1987.
   First-half revenue rose 13 percent, to $4.44 billion from $3.93
billion.
   Atlanta-based Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline, reported a
76 percent boost in profit in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year
ended June 30.
   Delta's fourth-quarter earnings jumped to $103.28 million, or
$2.11 a share, from $58.8 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier.
   The results for the latest quarter include a loss of $1.08
million, or 2 cents a share, from the disposition of aircraft and
an $89,000 loss from foreign currency translation.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 19.1 percent, to $1.87 billion from
$1.57 billion.
   Analysts said the airline probably benefited from troubles at
Eastern Airlines, Delta's main competitor.
   Miami-based Eastern has been beset by labor and financial
problems, including a federal safety inspection of its fleet, and
last week announced the layoffs of about 4,000 employees plus the
elimination of 140 flights.
   Prior to those cutbacks, Delta competed head-to-head with
Eastern on about 70 percent of its routes.
   For its fiscal year ended June 30, Delta's profit rose to
$306.83 million, or $6.30 a share, from $263.73 million, or $5.90 a
share, in fiscal 1987.
   It was Delta's first full fiscal year since its takeover of
Western Airlines.
   Revenue for the fiscal year increased to $6.92 billion from
$5.32 billion.

<HEAD>Major Maker of Ozone-Destroying CFC's Starts Producing
Alternatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co., a major producer of
chemicals that are destroying the earth's protective ozone shield,
said Thursday its plans were underway to begin producing
alternatives to the chemicals by this fall.
   The company will modify an existing facility in Montague, Mich.,
to produce alternatives to fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs, by as early as October.
   CFC's are non-toxic, non-flammable compounds that Du Pont helped
develop in the 1930s. They are widely used as refrigeration fluids,
cleaning solvents, plastic form blowing agents, and outside the
United States, as aerosol propellants.
   Du Pont announced last March that it planned to move away from
the production of CFC's in the next 12 years.
   The alternatives, to be used as blowing agents for a variety of
insulation and cushioning applications, could be commercialized in
five years, said company spokeswoman Kathleen Forte. First the
chemicals, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b, must be tested to ensure they
are not toxic.
   ``The ozone depletion rate of the new compounds is more than 95
percent less than existing compounds,'' Forte said.
   HCFC-141b is being evalutated as a replacement to CFCs used as
insulating materials in refrigerators, refrigerated trucks and rail
cars, homes and buildings, and as cushioning for automobile seats,
furniture and bedding.
   HCFC-142b is being tested in the manufacturing of polystyrene
insulation and polyolefin insulation and packaging.
   The plant will be one of three producing CFC alternatives.
   ``While our ultimate goal is to develop and commercialize
non-ozone depleting products, we will continue to search for
interim alternatives that will enable us to reduce dependence on
fully halogenated CFCs in a stepwise fashion,'' said Joseph P.
Glas, director of Du Pont's Freon Products Division.
   About 2.3 billion pounds of CFC compounds are made worldwide
each year, with more than 2,000 Du Pont employees producing about
25 percent of the total. The company says it gets $600 million
annually from CFC sales, about 2 percent of its total sales revenue.
   Last fall in Montreal, major producers agreed on a treaty, now
signed by 31 nations but ratified only by the United States and
Mexico, agreeing to cut CFC production 20 percent in 1992 and
another 30 percent in 1998.

   Tenneco Inc. reported Thursday that its
second-quarter profit more than tripled with an assist from a
one-time gain from sale of two subsidiaries.
   The company also announced it has opened its books to about 10
different bidders seeking to buy Tenneco Oil Co., the unit involved
in exploration and production and refining and marketing that was
put up for sale in May.
   For the three-month period ending June 30, the diversified
energy company posted net earnings of $154 million, or $1 per
share, compared with $46 million, or 24 cents per share, during the
same period a year ago.
   The latest results include a one-time gain of $23 million
related to the sale of Tenneco Oil Co. of Gebr. Broere, a European
shipping and storage company, and Mitchell Supreme, a New Jersey
heating oil retailing company.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 5.4 percent to $3.9 billion from
$3.7 billion a year earlier.
   For the first six months of 1988, Tenneco Inc. said its net
income nearly tripled to $217 million, or $1.38 per share, from $75
million, or 32 cents per share, for the first half of 1987.
   Six-month revenue rose 6.8 percent to $7.9 billion from $7.4
billion.
   ``The core of businesses which will comprise Tenneco following
the sale of the oil company reported strong profits with pipelines,
automotive, packaging, chemicals and agricultural and construction
equipment recording increases over last year,'' Ketelsen said.
   Each bidder for Tenneco Oil gets one week to review the
information, available through Aug. 25. The first round of bids is
due Sept. 30.
   ``We've been very encouraged by the interest,'' James L.
Ketelsen, chairman and chief operating officer of Tenneco, said
during a news conference.
   Ketelsen said potential buyers may bid on major segments or as a
whole. He declined to disclose names of the bidders, who signed
confidentialty agreements.
   When Tenneco announced plans to sell Tenneco Oil, it said it
would use the proceeds to help pay its hefty $8.5 billion debt.
Analysts have estimated that the sale could fetch between $5
billion to $7 billion.
   For the second quarter, the Tenneco Oil unit recorded net income
of $147 million, compared with $76 million for the same quarter in
1987.
