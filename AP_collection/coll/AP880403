<HEAD>With PM-World Easter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts from the official
Vatican translation in English of Pope John Paul II's Easter Sunday
message, ``Urbi et Orbi'' (To the City and World), given in Italian:
   Queen of heaven rejoice! Behold, precisely today on this first
day after the Sabbath the women went to the tomb, where the body of
your son had been laid, having been taken down from the cross, and
they found the stone rolled away, and the tomb empty.
   From within the tomb they heard a voice: ``Do not be amazed; you
seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not
here.''
   Rejoice, queen of heaven! Rejoice, mother of Chirst!
   ``But go, tell his disciples and Peter.''
   Then Mary of Magdala ran to tell the Apostles: ``They have taken
the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they haven laid
him.''
   Peter and John went at once to the place, and they found that it
was as the women had said. He is not here. He is not here, in the
place where they laid him, in the tomb. He is not here _ he has
risen.
   Rejoice, queen of heaven!
   Rejoice, queen of heaven. ... What the tongues of the first
witnesses now proclaim had first been foretold by himself.
   ``Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up .. .
he spoke of the temple of his body.'' His scourged, tortured
crucified body; his head wounded by the thorns; his side pierced by
the lance. He is not here. ... Rejoice, queen of heaven!
   Rejoice, Mary, rejoice, mother!
   You bore his body in your virginal womb, you bore within you the
God-man. And then you brought him forth on the night of Bethlehem,
you bore him in your arms as a child. You bore him into the temple
on the day of his presentation. Your eyes _ more than the eyes of
anyone else _ saw the incarnate word. Your ears heard him, from his
very first words. Your hands touched the word of life. Rejoice,
queen of heaven! ``He whom you bore has risen.''
   You bore him, even more than in your arms, in your heart.
Particularly during those last hours, when you had to stand beneath
the cross, at the feet of the divine condemned one. Your heart was
pierced by the sword of sorrow, in accordance with the words of the
aged Simeon. And you shared the sorrow as you associated yourself,
with your maternal soul, in the sacrifice of your son.
   O mother! You consented to the immolation of the victim whom you
had borne. You lovingly consented _ with that love which is planted
in your heart. With that love which is stronger than death and
stronger than sin, in the whole history of man on earth.
   And then, when he had breathed his last, and they had taken him
down from the cross, he rested once more in your arms, as he has
rested so many times before as a child ... And then, they laid him
in the tomb. They took him from your maternal arms and gave him
back to the earth; they closed the tomb with a stone ... And
behold, now the stone has been rolled away, the tomb is empty.
Christ whom you bore is risen, Hallelujah! Rejoice, queen of
heaven! This is the day of the church's Easter joy we all share in
your glory, O mother ... Everyone, the whole church of your son,
the whole church of the incarnate word.
   Christ whom you bore is risen! Pray for us! Your who were
present in the deepest possible way in the mystery of Christ.
Behold, the whole church today looks to you, O Mary. Even though we
do not see you among the people about whom the accounts of Easter
tell, we all look to you. We look to your heart. Could any
narrative record the moment of the resurrection of the son in the
heart of his mother? Yet we fix our gaze on you. The whole church
shares in your Easter joy the whole church knows that on this day
that the Lord has made you ``go before'' in a singular way along
this path of pilgrimage of faith in paschal mystery. Pray for us!
   During this year which has been dedicated in a particular way to
you, during this Marian year, be present in a special way in the
church, be present along all the paths of the people of God, paths
upon which shines the light of Christ. Let this light never leave
anyone, this light of the new life which is he himself, the risen
one!

   The legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated 20
years ago Monday, was remembered around the country Sunday by
blacks and whites continuing the fight for racial equality and
social justice that King began.
   ``Twenty years later, everything has changed and nothing has
changed,'' Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership conference, a civil rights organization formed by King,
said Sunday night at a memorial service in Memphis, Tenn.
   America's poor are as bad off as ever, speakers told the 500
people attending the service at the Mason Temple where King gave
his ``Mountain Top'' speech on the eve of his murder at the
Lorraine Motel in Memphis.
   ``I've been to the mountain top ... I've looked over, and I've
seen the promise land,'' King said in the speech. ``I may not get
there with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we as a people
will get to the promised land.''
   Benjamin Hooks, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said the address was one of the most
emotional he had heard King deliver.
   ``It was a tremendous experience,'' Hooks said before speaking
to about 500 people attending the Memphis service.
   Hooks urged the audience to renew its commitment to King's
``poor people's campaign,'' which was under way at the time of his
death.
   ``So Dr. King, we haven't made it yet ... but we are determined
from this day, we are going to march forward, and ain't nobody
going to turn us around,'' he said.
   On Monday in Memphis, a memorial sponsored by the city is to
begin with a ceremony at the Lorraine, followed by the beginning of
a Southern Christian Leadership Conference march through Alabama,
Mississippi and Georgia. That march is to conclude April 30 in
Atlanta.
   A simple wreath-laying ceremony will be held Monday afternoon at
King's tomb in Atlanta at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, has long favored an approach
focusing on her late husband's life, not his death. Last year, she
came out in opposition to plans to make the Lorraine Motel a
museum, and said she did not want such a project to bear his name.
   Also in Atlanta, the SCLC planned to hold its ninth annual
``Drum Major For Justice'' awards dinner Monday night. The event
takes its title from a phrase King used to describe how he wished
to be remembered. This year's honorees include U.S. Rep. Michael
Espy of Mississippi, singer Dionne Warwick and Washington Redskins
quarterback Doug Williams.
   Sharissa Fox, 17 and a senior at Greensboro Dudley High School
in North Carolina, worries that her generation may not hear King's
story often and powerfully enough.
   ``Black people have made progress since King's assassination,
but I don't think we have gone as far as he would have liked,'' she
said. ``His message was to help other people as much as we can. But
my generation is so hooked on themselves, they don't have time.''
   In Portland, Ore., nearly 100 people on Saturday joined in a
1.5-mile walk to mark King's assassination on April 4, 1968.
   ``When people gather together there is hope,'' said Ron Herndon,
co-director of Portland's Black United Front. ``The message is
there still are those who will stand up against racism.''

   A man apparently angry over a land
dispute involving his former in-laws opened fire on mourners
gathering for an Easter Sunday funeral, killing three and wounding
three others including his ex-wife, authorities said.
   The shooting occurred in the parking lot of the Mountain Home
Baptist Church, where family and friends gathered for a funeral
service for Effie Collins Justice, 79. The service had been
scheduled to begin at 3 p.m., officials said, and the shooting took
place shortly before that.
   ``It was just a really horrible experience, nothing I could ever
have imagined,'' said Lester Justice, a nephew of Mrs. Justice.
Like most of the mourners, Justice was already inside the small,
brick rural church when the shooting began but could hear the
gunfire.
   Michael Leslie Rainey, 41, was charged with three counts of
first-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly
weapon with intent to kill, according to a release from the
Henderson County Sheriff's Department.
   Rainey was being held without bond Sunday evening in the
Henderson County Jail, awaiting an initial court appearance set for
Monday morning.
   Sheriff's Capt. Tom Hatchett said the dead were the parents of
Rainey's ex-wife, along with a 24-year-old man whose relationship
to the family was not immediately determined.
   The three, Wilford Owensby, 61, of Fletcher; his wife, Ponnelle,
60; and Scott Bowles, 24, were all pronounced dead at the scene,
the sheriff's department said. Mrs. Owensby was Mrs. Justice's
daughter.
   The suspect's former wife, Andrea Rainey, 40, of Kennesaw, Ga.,
was taken to Margaret Pardee Hospital in Hendersonville where she
was listed in good condition with bullet wounds in the neck, said
hospital spokeswoman Mary Ann Morris.
   Mrs. Rainey's sister, Sheila Johnston, 30, of Fletcher, and her
daughter, Wendy Johnston, 11, were both listed in critical but
stable condition at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, said
nursing supervisor Evelyn Woody. Mrs. Johnston was wounded in the
chest, while her daughter was wounded in the leg, the hospital said.
   Rainey apparently confronted his former wife and her relatives
in the parking lot, Hatchett said.
   ``There seems to be some sort of domestic thing, over conflict
over some land,'' he said. The suspect owned land near the church
which is adjacent to property belonging to Mrs. Rainey's family, he
said.
   Witnesses said the suspect walked into the church to view the
body of Mrs. Justice, and then walked outside. Mourners in the
church then heard gunshots.
   ``I understand they were having visitation when he came to the
church. He apparently had weapons in a vehicle outside the church.
He went outside and got them out of the trunk and then started
shooting,'' Hatchett said.
   Hatchett said Rainey left the shooting scene on foot after
dropping the weapons in the parking lot. He was arrested without
incident a short distance away. Two weapons were found in the
parking lot, a handgun and a shotgun, Hatchett said.
   Witnesses said Mrs. Rainey drove herself and her wounded sister
and niece away from the church after the shooting, and her Ford
sedan was riddled with bullet holes. The three were in the car when
the shooting broke out, Hatchett said.
   The three reached the Hendersonville city limits, a few miles
away, before authorities transferred them from the blood-stained
car to ambulances.
   The funeral was canceled. Police were still interviewing
witnesses at the church Sunday evening.
   Edneyville is an unincorporated town in a rural area in the
western part of the state, about 20 miles southeast of Asheville.

Saturday violence. Pickup 2nd graf pvs, `County Supervisor...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Police Chief Daryl Gates vowed Saturday to
deploy 1,000 officers on gang-ridden south-central streets to keep
Easter churchgoers safe after a drive-by shooting in which one man
died and 12 others were wounded.
   Gang violence erupted later in the day when two gang members
were wounded by gunfire after a confrontation between rival groups
in a downtown parking lot, said police Lt. Orley Barton.
   The victims, both 21, were taken to Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center. A spokeswoman said one was in fair condition with a
gunshot wound in the foot and the second, who was hit in the
buttocks, was listed as serious.
   County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn sent a telegram to Gov. George
Deukmejian urging him to declare a state of emergency in Los
Angeles and send in two companies of military police from the
California National Guard.
   ``The people of Los Angeles County are increasingly living in a
state of fear. No one is safe,'' he wrote.
   ``The governor is very concerned about the escalation of gang
violence in Los Angeles County,'' said Deukmejian's press
secretary, Kevin Brett.
   However, he would declare a state of emergency only after the
city and county governments proclaim that such an emergency exists
and that it exceeds the capabilities of local law enforcement
officials, Brett said.
   No one had been arrested in Friday's shooting, but Gates said
police were investigating leads on two men seen shooting from a
passing car. One of those wounded was a 4-year-old boy.
   The shootings came in the midst of a police crackdown on
escalating gang violence, which only a day earlier prompted one Los
Angeles County supervisor to call for help from the California
National Guard.
   ``If we were angry before, we are exceedingly angry now,'' Gates
said at a news conference where he called gang members ``rotten
little cowards ... who shoot down 4-year-old kids.''
   Plans were under way to put 1,000 officers on south-central
streets where 200 officers usually patrol, Gates said, adding that
300 officers would be out Saturday night.
   ``We have all this shooting going on on the holy weekend. People
in south-central L.A. want to go to church tomorrow and we're going
to make sure they're safe,'' Gates said.
   He also called for night sessions at all courts in order to
speed up trials and put criminals behind bars, special courts to
handle gang and narcotic cases, and a south-central justice center.
   Lt. Charles Massey said Friday's shots were fired on turf
claimed by five or six gangs, and that the shootings probably were
intended as some type of retaliation. Police believe a
semi-automatic weapon was used.
   Rodney Bragg, 16, said he saw men in a Cadillac stop and talk to
a group of people.
   ``All of a sudden they just opened up,'' he said. ``There were
about 20 shots, I guess. Maybe more than that. You could hear them
hitting the trees and the houses _ everything.''
   The car sped off and then returned ``for another look'' before
fleeing, Bragg said.
   At least 25 rounds were fired, Gates said.
   Cmdr. William Booth said 13 people were hit. Only 11 were
accounted for at local hospitals. Authorities said two people may
have sought medical attention on their own.
   Seven anti-gang police sweeps through the city in the past
month, including one through the southside Thursday night, have
resulted in 874 arrests and seizures of weapons, drugs, cash and
cars.
   On Thursday, county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn asked Gov. George
Deukmejian to call in the National Guard to help quell gang
violence.
   Hahn cited 387 gang-related deaths within the county last year
and said the gang-related death rate in the first three months of
1988 exceeds the rate for the same period last year.
   However, since the sweeps, the tally of gang-related homicides
apparently has decreased, from 25 in March 1987 to 14 in March
1988, police said.

<HEAD>Wartime British Pilot Captured By German Army Says Waldheim Saved
His Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former British fighter pilot was reported Sunday
as saying Austrian President Kurt Waldheim saved his life and those
of other Allied prisoners during World War II by preventing them
falling into the hands of Nazi executioners.
   The Sunday Times said the pilot, Bruce Ogilvie, is the ``first
and possibly the only British ex-serviceman to speak in defense of
Waldheim,'' who denies accusations of involvement in war crimes
when he was serving with the German army.
   Ogilvie, now 66, said he was in danger of being shot when he was
found armed and in civilian clothes on the British-occupied Greek
island of Leros in November 1943, the day after German paratroops
invaded.
   He said he was taken to an airfield outside Athens where he met
Waldheim, who introduced himself by name and ensured that Ogilvie
and others were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp instead of the Nazi
SS, who shot prisoners.
   Ogilvie said Waldheim took the prisoners' identity discs and
gave them substitutes which had been taken from the bodies of
Allied servicemen killed in action. The discs enabled the prisoners
to prove they were not commandos or spies.
   Ogilvie said he mentioned Waldheim's help to Royal Air Officers
who debriefed him after his release from a prison camp in May 1945.

   Thousands of cyclists, joggers and sightseers
turned out Saturday and Sunday to cross Japan's majestic Seto
Ohashi Bridge, which straddles five small islands over an expanse
of 7.6 miles in the Seto Inland Sea.
   Police bands performed and hundreds of balloons were set off as
Seto bridge authorities feted to mark the completion of the first
physical linkup between the main island of Honshu and Shikoku
Island, located on the Pacific side of southeastern Japan.
   About 100,000 pedestrians, selected by lottery from around the
country, formed a human link between Shikoku and Honshu on the
bridge at noon Sunday.
   On Saturday, 3,000 people crossed the Ohashi (literally Great
Bridge) on bicycles, while an estimated 7,000-8,000 joggers joined
in later the same day.
   The bridge, which cost $8.7 billion and took 10 years to build,
will open to both rail and vehicle traffic after the official
opening April 10.
   Transportation officials acknowledge that while the railway
portion of the bridge is not expected to recoup its construction
costs, toll charges for the highway section of the bridge should
help to keep operation costs near or above deficit levels.
   The Seto Ohashi Bridge, consisting of six suspension bridges in
the style of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, will be formally
connected to that Californian symbol in a sister bridge ceremony
scheduled for Tuesday.

   Three moderate overnight quakes shook the
Greek capital, frightening some residents out of their homes but
causing no damage or injuries, officials said Sunday.
   A spokesman for the Athens Seismological Institute said the
first temblor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale at 11:06 p.m.
Saturday. It had its epicenter 12 miles east of Athens, just
outside the seaside resort town of Loutsa.
   The second quake struck in the same area at 00:58 a.m. Sunday
and registered 4.6 on the Richter scale.
   The third tremor, hitting 4.4 on the Richter scale, took place
at 06:35 a.m. Sunday and had its its epicenter 47 miles
west-northwest of Athens.
   ``We had some minor panic and some people ran out of their homes
and into the streets, but we had no damage,'' said a police
spokesman in Loutsa.
   The earthquakes, felt all over the capital, did not cause much
panic, Athens police said.
   ``We had alot of people call in to see what happened but we had
no reports of serious panic,'' an Athens police spokesman said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union set off an underground nuclear
test explosion early Sunday in the republic of Kazakhstan, the
official Tass news agency reported.
   The blast, the third nuclear test announced by the Soviets this
year, was ``carried out with a view to upgrading military
technology,'' Tass said.
   The explosion had a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons, Tass said. The
U.S. atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, had a
yield of 20 kilotons, or the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT.
   The device was exploded at the Soviet Union's main nuclear
testing range in Semipalatinsk, in the Central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan.
   Tass provided no further information on the blast.
   In January, an American scientific delegation visited the
Semipalatinsk range to gather information that may be used in
verifying U.S.-Soviet compliance with a future test ban.
   An exchange of visits to Semipalatinsk and to the U.S. nuclear
testing site in Nevada is planned this month.
   The Soviet government has been pressing for a pact prohibiting
nuclear testing, but U.S. and Soviet officials disagree on
enforcement procedures.

<HEAD>Army: Arab Electrocuted While Hanging Palestinian Flag To Utility
Pole</HEAD>

   The army said an Arab youth was electrocuted
Sunday when he tried to attach a Palestinian flag to a utility
pole. Hospital officials said a second Arab died of gunshot wounds
suffered last week in a clash with Israeli soldiers.
   The fatalities came hours before the scheduled arrival of
Secretary of State George P. Shultz for a third round of talks with
Israeli leaders on his Middle East peace initiative and while
hundreds of Christians celebrated Easter in Jerusalem.
   The deaths also occurred a day after Israeli soldiers shot and
killed six Arab protesters in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, the highest one-day death toll in four months of unrest.
   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted military sources as saying
the army has adopted a new policy of entering even remote Arab
villages to break up protests instead of ignoring demonstrators as
long as they did not endanger lives or interfere with traffic on
the main roads.
   ``The confrontations (over the weekend) were a result of our
initiative,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel radio.
   In Jerusalem, about 1,000 pilgrims from around the world
attended Easter Sunday services in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher
where most Christians believe Jesus was buried and rose from the
dead.
   Church officials said the number of worshipers dropped by half
from last year, apparently because many pilgrims were scared away
by the violence in the occupied territories.
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, 40 miles northwest of
Jerusalem, an army official said a 20-year-old Arab youth died
early Sunday after being electrocuted when he tried to attach a
red, white, black and green Palestinian flag, outlawed by Israel,
to a utility pole.
   After receiving the shock, the youth fell from the pole and hit
his head, said the official who, in keeping with army regulations,
spoke on condition of anonymity. The youth was pronounced dead at
Tulkarem Hospital.
   Arab journalists identified the victim as 15-year-old Mahmoud
Abdul Rahim Jarad and said he was shot to death by Israeli soldiers.
   Officials at Tulkarem Hospital could not immediately be reached
for comment on the cause of death.
   At Ramallah Hospital, 10 miles north of Jerusalem, a 40-year-old
Arab died Sunday of wounds he suffered Wednesday in a clash with
Israeli soldiers. During the clash, Ali Diab Abu Ali of the West
Bank village Yatta, was shot in the neck and paralyzed, said a
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   His death brought to 134 the number of Arabs killed in four
months of anti-Israeli protests, according to U.N. figures. The
youth from Tulkarem was not included in the count because of
conflicting reports on the circumstances of his death. One Israeli
soldier has died in the violence.
   Shultz is scheduled to meet Monday with Rabin, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Israel radio
quoted sources in Egypt as saying Shultz planned to present to
Israeli leaders an invitation to an international peace conference
which is to launch direct bilateral negotiations between the
parties to the conflict.
   Shamir opposes key elements of the Shultz plan, especially a
proposed international conference. The Jerusalem Post quoted a
Shamir aide as saying ``if Shultz doesn't present any new ideas in
his talks with Shamir ... , the prime minister will not budge.''
   Peres supports the Shultz plan.

Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, then appealed for world peace and
offered Easter greetings in 52 languages to thousands of worshipers
in rain-drenched St. Peter's Square.
   Among the thousands of people who packed Christendom's biggest
church for the Mass was U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
who was to leave later in the day for Israel on a new Middle East
peace mission.
   The Mass, usually held on the flower-decked travertine steps of
St. Peter's, was moved inside the church because of rain. But the
pope later spoke from the church's central balcony as more than
100,000 people stood in the square below.
   In his traditional Easter message ``Urbi and Orbi'' (to the city
of Rome and the world) following the Mass, the pope asked the
Virgin Mary to pray for peace, justice, human rights and religious
freedom.
   Departing from his written text and speaking emotionally in a
strong, hoarse voice, the pontiff said, ``Pray for peace in the
world, for justice, pray for the rights of man, especially for
religious freedom, for every man, for every Christian and
non-Christian, pray for us.''
   ``Pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world, the first
world, second, third and fourth, all the world,'' he said. ``In
yours and our Easter joy, we carry again this weight of humanity,
this weight of so many human hearts, our brothers, our sisters, and
we repeat: pray for us.''
   In a private audience on Saturday, Shultz had received the
pope's blessing for his voyage.
   Shultz's wife, Helena, a Roman Catholic, was one of those taking
Communion from the pope.
   Winter weather descended on Rome this weekend, with a cold,
steady rain drenching the capital Sunday morning.
   It was decided at the last moment to move the service inside the
basilica, where the pope celebrated Mass from an altar under the
``Baldacchino,'' the immense Baroque canopy designed by Bernini.
   The Italian news agency ANSA estimated that 150,000 Romans,
pilgrims and tourists _ most of them huddling under umbrellas _
stood outside in the square and its side streets and listened to
the service broadcast on loud speakers by Radio Vatican.
   The crowd broke into loud cheers and chants of ``Viva il Papa''
(long live the pope) when John Paul, keeping with tradition,
appeared on the central balcony at noon to deliver his Easter
message and blessing.
   The message was directed to the Virgin Mary, for whom the pope
has a special devotion and dedicated the current Marian Year.
   ``Christ whom you bore is risen, Alleluia,'' said the pope,
wearing a white robe trimmed in gold and a tall, gold miter, or
bishop's hat. ``Queen of heaven, rejoice. This is the day of the
church's Easter joy. We all share in your glory, oh mother.''
   ``Behold the whole church today tooks to you, oh Mary. Even
though we do not see you among the people about whom the accounts
of Easter tell, we all look to you ...
   ``During this year, which has been dedicated in a particular way
to you, during this Marian Year, be present in a special way in the
church..''
   Then, following his improvised plea for world peace, the
polyglot pope wished the world a happy Easter in 52 languages. The
longest greeting was in his native Polish.

   Iraq said its warplanes raided two oil
refineries deep inside Iran on Sunday, but Iran said the bombs
landed in residential areas and killed at least five civilians and
wounded 50 more.
   The attacks signaled the rekindling of the ``war of the cities''
after a break of 2{ days. Hundreds of civilians have been killed or
wounded in more than a month of missile and warplane raids on major
population centers.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as
saying the strikes on the refineries near the cities of Isfahan and
Tabriz were carried out at 2:40 p.m.
   That was about six hours after Turkish Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal left the Iraqi capital. Baghdad had ceased its attacks on
Iranian cities during his visit and announced it would not resume
attacks for six hours after he left.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said the warplanes bombed
residential quarters in Tabriz, in northeastern Iran, and the
central city of Isfahan.
   At least five civilians were killed and 50 wounded, said the
news agency report. The Iranian and Iraqi dispatches were monitored
in Cyprus.
   The Iranian agency claimed that anti-aircraft batteries shot
down one of the warplanes at Isfahan ``seconds after the attack''
on the city.
   It did not say where the plane fell nor disclose the fate of the
pilot. Iraq had no comment on the claim.

   Two Moscow factory managers were expelled from the
Communist Party for embezzlement, on-the-job drinking parties and
paying $1.6 million to two hockey players who masqueraded as
machine operators, a Soviet newspaper said Sunday.
   The report in Pravda, the official paper of the Communist Party,
was taken to be a message to party members at all state industries.
   Pravda also reported that party's Control Committee had
disciplined two officials of the state Ministry for Aviation
Machine-Building involved in the errant enterprise.
   The report said the managers of the Salyut air transport
machine-building enterprise engaged in embezzlement but it did not
give a total figure for the losses suffered by the factory.
   Still, the newspaper gave several examples of excesses that cost
in the tens of thousands of dollars, indicating the violations were
broad.
   Factory director Y.V. Pugin and party committee chairman A.G.
Samarkin were expelled, and other senior party officials at the
plant and the ministry were reprimanded, the newspaper said.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms aimed at
improving economic performance, party members have come under close
scrutiny.
   Only about 8 percent of Soviet adults gain entrance into the
all-powerful party, and the Control Commission is charged with
ensuring that Communists set an appropriate example for other
workers.
   Stories about the abuse of authority and inattention to the
cause of poor performance have become common as the party carries
out internal reviews of its personnel.

   Two New Zealand climbers died
and a third was injured after they plunged 500 feet down a
mountainside while roped together, police said Sunday.
   The two women and a man fell off Mount Cook as they were
approaching the top of the Copeland Pass, police spokesman Bill
Apes said.
   Two alpine guides witnessed the accident from the Copeland
shelter, he said.
   One radioed for help while the other went to the scene, where
the man died. One of the women suffered head injuries and was flown
by helicopter to Timaru Hospital where she died on Saturday night.
   The other woman was admitted to hospital with moderate injuries,

   SALON-DE-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ A Spanish bus carrying 53
people Sunday slammed into a small truck that stopped on a highway
because of a flat tire. Police said the drivers of both vehicles
were killed.
   The truck's driver had stopped in the right line to repair the
flat tire and one of its four occupants tried to alert traffic,
police said.
   The Spanish bus, traveling in the same direction, hit the truck
from behind and killed its driver, 32-year-old Bouhid Abdellati.
The driver of the bus, Eduardo Asensio Arribas, 61, also was killed.
   The three other occupants of the truck suffered no injuries.
   Twenty-six passengers on the bus were slightly injured and taken
to local hospitals. They were identified as teen-agers from a
religious school in Saragosa.

<HEAD>Candidate of the Downtrodden Gets Support from the Already
Uplifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, accustomed to bringing an
uplifting message to the downtrodden, found a warm reception among
the already uplifted at this chic ski playground.
   Looking to win delegates in Mondays' Colorado Democratic
caucuses, Jackson dropped in on the sunny, snowy resort high in the
Rocky Mountains on Saturday afternoon.
   It was a visit that took the black civil rights leader and
presidential candidate a long way from his usual audiences _ like
the Hispanics who surged to touch him in Pueblo, and the striking
meatpackers in Greeley who cheered wildly to his denunciation of
the rich and powerful earlier in the day.
   ``I was surprised he came here,'' said Mary Scheerer, a tanned
and blond frequent visitor from Minneapolis who strained to get
Jackson in the sights of her video camera as he arrived. ``I guess
it's because the mayor invited him.''
   Jackson was greeted by the town's white, bearded mayor, Bill
Stirling, a local real estate man who sported a Jackson bumper
sticker across his white cowboy hat. Later, wearing a blue
pin-stripe suit and bow tie, he danced and sang along with a
recorded campaign song after introducing the candidate.
   ``People have said, `Why Aspen?' It's too glitzy, too lily
white, too middle class,'' the mayor said, his last remark drawing
laughter. ``Well, we vote here too.''
   Arriving after a day of skiing was Tom Hayden, the California
legislator and husband of actress Jane Fonda. He wasn't endorsing
Jackson, he said, but he had nice things to say about him.
   The gathering spilled out the door from the ornate room in the
old Jerome Hotel, a recently restored three-story brick building
that looks like it came straight out of the Old West _ but updated
for the ski crowd. To get to Jackson's speech, people walked past
guests frolicking in the hotel's outdoor hot tub and through a bar
with a giant chandelier made of antlers.
   Some who turned out were supporters, and some just seemed
curious. Many wore bright ski suits.
   One man dressed in cowboy shirt and hat, face red from skiing,
said on his way in: ``We're here for both _ Jesse and the fashion
show.'' He said there really was a fashion show in town, but he
might have been talking about the affluent, all-white crowd's
wardrobe.
   Others claimed to be real supporters. At the Pitkin County
Airport, where the idle private jets of Aspen's visitors wait in
rows, Andrea Hanson was among the handful of greeters.
   ``I just think he's the best thing going,'' said Hanson, clad in
a black leather miniskirt. She described herself as an author of
children's books.
   Posters printed by local supporters invited people to see
Jackson. Included was a notice that the reception beforehand was
``for substantial contributors only ($100 to $1,000).''
   Jackson spoke passionately, as usual, of the poor, but at the
same time responded to his monied audience. The poor work, he said,
and are all around, even in Aspen.
   ``They changed the sheets in the hotel you slept in last
night,'' he said.
   ``The upper class cannot remain upper if there is not a middle
class,'' he told the substantial contributors.
   One man put a tough question to Jackson: did he back raising
taxes as high as 60 percent on upper incomes like his own? It would
discourage the creation of jobs, he said.
   ``To tax you 60 percent would be as absurd as a tax cut,''
responded Jackson, who hours earlier had denounced President Reagan
for ``reverse Robin Hood'' _ taking from the poor for the rich.
Jackson suggested the tax rates before President Reagan's 1981 tax
cut were reasonable.
   With the larger crowd, Jackson didn't miss an opportunity to ask
for contributions to his campaign.
   ``Give like you live _ high,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson led in responsive chants as he does with other audiences
_ evoking such shouts as ``vote'' and ``Jesse.'' When they didn't
get it right, he interrupted: ``Let's stop and do it right, do it
with rhythm and soul.''
   A few feet to the side, Hayden was talking politics and
speculating on a Mario Cuomo-Jesse Jackson ticket.
   ``Something very powerful is happening,'' Hayden said. ``I don't
know if he can win in November, but nobody else is having an effect
like this.''
   Jackson seemed to enjoy his visit, too. The chanting done,
Jackson grinned and waved.
   ``Okay, Aspen,'' he said.

   A military exhibit at a
popular South African festival includes a detailed demonstration on
how to plant and detect land mines.
   The South African Defense Force exhibit is part of the Grand
Rand Show, a three-week festival that began Wednesday on the
outskirts of Johannesburg.
   The large military display includes a section with a South
African soldier explaining how land mines work and how the military
detects them.
   Visitors are allowed to handle the mine detector and wear the
headset that gives off a beeping noise when a dummy mine is
detected.
   If someone steps on the dummy mine, it gives off a harmless puff
of green smoke. The soldier at the exhibit also explains the proper
way to plant and disguise a land mine.
   Guerrillas of the African National Congress often employ land
mines as part of their bombing and sabotage campaign to overthrow
the white-led government.

   Boldly going where few have gone before,
actor William Shatner touched hands and talked with Koko the
gorilla.
   Shatner, also known as Capt. James T. Kirk of ``Star Trek''
fame, spent half an hour with the celebrated 16-year-old lowland
gorilla at the Gorilla Foundation Saturday. Koko lives at the
nonprofit organization's center and has been taught to understand
2,000 words of spoken English and use a vocabulary of 600 signs.
   ``Koko and I talked,'' Shatner said. ``We touched hands and we
touched minds. Feeling her powerful hand on the back of my neck was
unlike any other experience I've known.''
   Koko also touched Shatner on the face, making what Dr. Francine
``Penny'' Patterson, Koko's trainer and the foundation president,
interpreted as romantic overtures.
   Koko has communicated to foundation officials that she ``want
gorilla baby.'' The foundation has made arrangements to have her
artificially inseminated.
   Shatner was promoting a new program under which Californians can
donate money to help endangered species through a checkoff on their
state tax forms.

   Prince Charles and Princess Diana have
``ordinary'' marital quarrels, but Diana still loves her husband
and is happy as a member of the royal family, her father, Earl
Spencer, was quoted as saying Sunday.
   In an interview with Woman's Own magazine, the earl was also
quoted as saying Diana, who has two sons, William, 5, and Harry, 3,
wants a larger family _ perhaps five children.
   ``Charles and Diana have their rows, what couple doesn't. But
they are nothing out of the ordinary'' the 64-year-old aristocrat
was quoted as saying.
   ``What makes it so different for them is that they're on show
all the time. They might have had a disagreement, then they have to
step out in front of the cameras and pretend that everything is
going well and that's not easy.''
   Spencer was questioned about press reports that the marriage of
Charles, 39, and Diana, 26, now in its seventh year, was in deep
trouble.
   Spencer said dismissed reports his daughter is bored and
frustrated with her role.
   ``She's the fairy tale princess because she does a wonderful
job.'' Spencer was quoted as saying. ``She's very genuine, she's
very beautiful and she's still very much in love with Charles.''

   Actor-director Spike Lee didn't shy from
a heated debate with Fisk University students about his latest
film, ``School Daze.''
   Lee appeared at this black school Thursday to promote the movie,
which focuses on a black college and students' attitudes about
fraternities.
   ``The fraternity members were upset about how fraternities were
portrayed in the film. We had 90 minutes of heated dialogue. It was
very healthy and just the kind of thing I like to see happen,'' he
said.
   Lee said the movie is about the need for ``more unity among
black people.''
   ``The viewers from the black underclass will see in the film
what they have seen in real life _ being looked down upon and
shunned by the middle class,'' said Lee, who is black.
   His first movie, the surprise hit ``She's Gotta Have It,'' was
made for $175,000 and has reaped about $8 million.

   Restaurateur and mayoral candidate
Sonny Bono says he regrets his outburst at a televised candidates'
forum but refuses to apologize.
   The forum had been under way for more than an hour Thursday
night when Bono arrived and said he couldn't participate because
his pregnant wife was ill.
   Bono, the former husband and singing partner of Cher, demanded
to know why moderator Ed Kibbey had not explained Bono's absence.
   Kibbey said neither he nor the forum's sponsor, the Palm Springs
Jaycees, were told why Bono was absent. He asked the candidate to
join the forum, but Bono declined and said he would return to his
wife.
   At one point, Bono told Kibbey, ``If anything happens to her,
you're going to have to answer to me.''
   The interruption prompted booing and shouts, and a walkout of 20
Bono supporters.
   ``I regret getting that upset, but it's almost like being
handcuffed. I couldn't get my explanation out,'' Bono told a news
conference Friday.
   His wife, Mary, was admitted to hospital Wednesday with the flu
and returned home Friday.

   Paolo Milano, a professor and prominent literary
critic, has died after a long illness. He was 84.
   Milano, who died of Parkinson's disease Saturday in Rome, was
described by the city's daily La Repubblica on Sunday as ``one of
the most cosmopolitan voices of Italian culture.''
   Born in Rome in 1904, Milano, a Jew, fled the Italian fascist
regime in the late 1930s. After a brief period in Paris, he settled
in New York in 1940.
   He lived there for 15 years teaching comparative literature at
Queens College and at the New School of Social Research.
   He edited ``The Portable Dante,'' published in 1947, and wrote
``Henry James _ The Voluntary Exile,'' which came out in 1948. He
also contributed articles to such publications as Politics, the
Partisan Review and The Nation.
   From 1957 to 1986, Milan worked in Rome as literary critic of
the Italian weekly magazine L'Espresso.
   His funeral was scheduled for Tuesday in the Jewish Cemetery of
Rome. Survivors are his wife, Rachel, of New York; a son Andrew, of
Scarsdale, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.

   Three moderate earthquakes shook Athenians
awake Saturday and Sunday while another strong temblor rocked the
western resort island of Corfu.
   None of the quakes caused injuries or damage, authorities said.
   A spokesman for the Athens Seismological Institute said a strong
quake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale occurred at 11:56 a.m.
Sunday. Its epicenter was 212 miles northwest of Athens in the
seabed off the island of Corfu.
   The popular resort island has about 2,000 mostly British
tourists visiting over the Easter holiday, local police said.
   Three other quakes registering 4.2, 4.6 and 4.4 on the Richter
scale rumbled through the Greek capital between 11 p.m. Saturday
and 7 a.m. Sunday.
   ``The four quakes are not geologically connected, we rule out
the chance of a disastrous quake coming from any of the areas ...
so people shouldn't panic,'' Professor Yiannis Dracopoulos,
Greece's senior seismologist, told state-run television.
   The Athens region has 3.5 million residents, a third of Greece's
population.
   The first two quakes had their epicenters 12.5 miles east of
Athens in the seabed off the coastal town of Loutsa, while the
third had its epicenter 47 miles northwest of the capital.
   An Athens police spokesman said the three quakes were felt
throughout the capital, but didn't cause any injuries or damage.
   ``We had a lot of people calling in to find out what was
happening but nobody panicked,'' said a police spokesman who
requested anonymity.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage while a
force 5 temblor can cause considerable damage.

   Under police and army guard, pilgrims from
around the world gathered at dawn for Easter Sunday services in the
church marking the site where most Christians believe Jesus rose
from the dead.
   About 1,000 worshipers _ half as many as last year _ attended
services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, church
officials said.
   Many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost daily
violence in the Israeli-occupied territories that have left more
than 130 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. The Greek
Orthodox Church canceled three pre-Easter processions scheduled for
the weekend.
   Security was low-key Sunday at the Crusader-built church, where
about half a dozen uniformed police stood guard in the courtyard
and at the entrance.
   But dozens of soldiers were stationed throughout the walled Old
City, some on rooftops and others patrolling the narrow cobblestone
streets. An Arab attacker stabbed an Israeli policeman in the Old
City on Friday.
   ``Before we came, our friends were worried and said they would
pray for us,'' said 71-year-old Arnold Rosenbrock, a Lutheran from
Kankakee, Ill.
   ``We've been fine, but someone was killed in Bethlehem yesterday
(Saturday) a few hours before we visited,'' he added. ``There were
boulders in the street, and it was tense.''
   ``We were frightened before we came, but now that we are here,
we feel it is safe,'' said Philip Jiamachello, 31, of Houston,
Texas, who attended the services with his wife and young son. ``For
me, this was a very moving experience.''
   Tourism ministry officials said they had no figures for the
month of March, but acknowledged a 13 percent drop in tourism for
the first week of the month as compared with a year ago. Officials
also expressed concern about possible cancellations in April and
May.
   Clouds of incense and organ music filled the church during the
Latin service held in front of the marble-enclosed tomb marking the
site where Jesus is believed to have been resurrected.
   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, Monsignor Michel
Sabbah, the first Palestinian to hold the post, presided over the
service. Last week, he called on worshipers to make special Easter
prayers for those caught up in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   At the church entrance, visiting pilgrims kissed and pressed
their foreheads to the rose-colored marble stone where followers
are believed to have washed Jesus' body before his burial.
   Several worshipers dropped handkerchiefs to soak up some of the
holy water that dampens the stone.
   Others walked upstairs to the candle-lit table marking the site
where Jesus' cross is believed to have been buried.
   ``One feels very humble walking on the same soil where Christ
walked,'' said Gale Crisher, 48, of Long Island, N.Y. ``My children
couldn't believe I was coming to Israel now, but I felt have very
comfortable here.''
   While the Roman Catholics were celebrating Easter, Orthodox
denominations were marking their Palm Sunday, walking along the Via
Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrow, where Jesus, wearing a crown of thorns,
was forced to carry the cross on which he died. Orthodox Christians
celebrate Easter this coming Sunday.
   In the midst of the Easter Service, about two dozen chanting
Coptic priests and choir boys in long dark robes entered the church
carrying palm leaves, some formed in the shape of a cross.
   Easter also fell on the third day of the Jewish holiday of
Passover, commemorating the deliverance of the ancient Hebrews from
slavery in Egypt.
   Palestinian shopkeepers opened stores around the church from
morning until noon, the times permitted by the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The PLO has ordered afternoon strikes in Arab east
Jerusalem to protest the Israeli occupation.
   But even merchants who remained open complained there was little
business.
   ``I sold about $1,000 worth of items a day last year during Holy
Week. This year, I'm lucky if it is $100,'' said Mike Mannix, a
Jerusalem-born Palestinian and owner of a shop selling olive-wood
crosses and icons.
   ``Last Easter my store was filled to the doorway and people were
crowded on the streets outside,'' the 32-year-old Mannix added.
``This year, there is no one.''

<TEXT>
   Two years after a U.S. bombing raid
shocked the nation, Libyans are breathing a bit easier.
   Moammar Gadhafi, their leader and the target of the attack, is
permitting some long-awaited, though small steps to fix the
economy. He is also calling for greater personal liberty.
   ``And it's true, right, that Reagan can't become president
again?'' asked a Libyan military man, confident that life is
looking up for his countrymen.
   For the U.S. president, Col. Gadhafi was the ``mad dog of the
Middle East'' and a sponsor of terrorism, including 1985 attacks on
airports in Rome and Vienna. To Gadhafi, Reagan was the ``Israeli
dog'' in the ``black house,'' the villain behind the April 15,
1986, bombing, which Libyans say killed the colonel's baby daughter
and 36 other people.
   The good-guy, bad-guy rhetoric drew attention from an economy
badly needing direction, especially after falling oil prices
flattened Libya's plump cushion of petroleum income. The global
theater also overshadowed the growing demands of Libyan consumers.
   Now Gadhafi seems bent on ensuring his popularity by improving
life for his more than 3.5 million countrymen in the North African
nation.
   Of course, motives are often difficult to judge in the case of
the mercurial colonel who came to power in a 1969 coup and who is
now simply called ``the leader'' by Libyans.
   Some observers think the 45-year-old Gadhafi may have decided to
reform his virulent anti-Americanism, which sometimes made him an
easy target of U.S. outrage. Others think Gadhafi may also have
been affected by an Amnesty International appeal in July to end an
alleged policy of assassinating opposition figures.
   While slogans denouncing purported American aggression are still
plastered on buildings, one diplomat says that there has been a
quiet exchange of messages between the U.S. and Libyan governments
indicating a desire, if not to improve relations, at least to keep
channels open.
   There are several signs Gadhafi may also have decided to push
for a more liberal economy.
   A Tripoli newspaper last month reported that small businesses
are now permitted to import items, such as automobile parts,
previously allowed only for government-franchise holders, and sell
them at a profit. Diplomats were apparently told to improve
distribution of consumer goods, and more private businesses were
allowed to operate.
   Insisting repeatedly that Libyans must produce for themselves,
Gadhafi has tried to reduce dependence on imports, especially after
Libya's oil revenues dropped dramatically from a 1980 peak of $22
billion.
   By 1986, lower oil prices saw annual revenue plummet to less
than $6 billion. Prospects for slightly higher oil prices this year
could put income at about $6.5 billion.
   On Tripoli's shopping streets, business seems to have grown over
the past year. Freshly slaughtered fat chickens hang from doorways
enticing customers. Women _ some shrouded head-to-toe in white
cotton, others in form-fitting, olive green military pants and
jackets _ examine satin-striped fabric, while men try out imported
calculators.
   It seems every other store window has cheap leather shoes, vinyl
pocketbooks and suitcases.
   A diplomat reports that in the past year the government, which
likes to boast of an extensive health care system, is allowing
Libyans to buy Western currency and go abroad, ostensibly for
medical treatment.
   One thing that hasn't changed in Libya, though, is the ground
rule of anonymity which covers conversations with diplomats,
businessmen and the few Libyans willing to give their reading on
what's happening.
   Gadhafi has been focusing as well on personal liberties.
   One afternoon last month, the masterful user of the media rode a
bulldozer to knock down the gate of a Tripoli prison. To the cheers
of one of the largest rallies in the capital in years, according to
a diplomat, Gadhafi declared that the released inmates included
some who had plotted to kill him.
   A week later, Gadhafi called for abolishing the death penalty in
a nation where hangings have been broadcast on state television.
   On March 28, Gafhafi announced that all arrests should be backed
by a court order.
   ``This is a very good thing,'' said a smiling Libyan, relaxing
in a lounge a few hours after the speech. ``Now members of the
Revolutionary Committees just come up and take people away without
warning.''
   The committees are Gadhafi's watchdogs of revolutionary ideology.
   Gadhafi also announced he is withdrawing troops from eastern
Libya as a goodwill gesture toward its eastern neighbor, Egypt,
with which it has been feuding for 15 years.

   Communist rebels suffered a major
setback with the recent arrest of their top leaders, but military
officials and analysts say the insurgents are far from beaten.
   Through their 19-year rebellion, the guerrillas have
demonstrated remarkable resilience. Despite harsh crackdowns, their
influence has spread from the countryside to urban centers, attacks
have stepped up and captured leaders have been replaced immediately.
   President Corazon Aquino, who has vowed to crush the insurgency
before her term expires in 1992, hailed last Tuesday's arrests of
the New People's Army commander and the Communist Party's No. 2 man
as the beginning of the end.
   ``It clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are
winning the war against the Communist insurgency,'' she said in a
statement.
   But military officials and others say the president may have
spoken too soon, although they acknowledge that the arrests were a
big blow to the 25,000-strong guerrilla army.
   ``It will disturb some of their programs,'' Brig. Gen. Rodolfo
Biazon, Manila area commander, said of the arrests. ``But to say
that this means the defeat of the Communist movement may not
entirely be correct because we are fighting an idea, and the idea
is still there.''
   Francisco Tatad, a columnist and former information minister
under ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, noted the insurgents not
only survived but expanded after the capture of party founder Jose
Maria Sison and former rebel commander Bernabe Buscayno in the
mid-1970s.
   Tatad said the rebels now enjoy broad support among workers,
students, the clergy and other groups in society and that the
government must improve its services ``to make the very idea of
insurgency obsolete.''
   Still, the arrests of rebel commander Romulo Kintanar,
Secretary-General Rafael Baylosis and four other rebels marked a
dramatic success for the government.
   They came as the military was on alert for rebel attacks marking
last Tuesday's 19th anniversary of the rebel force. Instead it was
the military which struck, raiding Communist hideouts in the
capital.
   The arrest of Kintanar, 37, is especially significant. Kintanar,
a master guerrilla strategist, was widely believed to have
organized assassination squads known as ``Sparrow Units,'' which
brought the guerrilla conflict from the countryside to the cities.
   Police say up to 4,000 Sparrows are deployed in metropolitan
Manila, where they have killed more than 150 police, soldiers and
government officials since January 1987.
   Veteran journalist Max Soliven wrote in the Philippine Star that
for the first time in years, the rebels are ``now sweating it
out.'' But he warned against complacency.
   The rebels ``are so desperate at this juncture that they may
unleash a series of furious attacks and ambushes, just to create
the impression that the movement remains strong,'' Soliven wrote.
   Sen. Rene Saguisag, Mrs. Aquino's former spokesman, agreed it
was too early to say whether the arrests have dealt a fatal blow to
the insurgency.
   Saguisag said one factor favoring the government is Mrs.
Aquino's continued popularity. Another, he said, was the ongoing
attempt to hammer out a land reform act.
   He said since Mrs. Aquino took over from Marcos on Feb. 25,
1986, she has introduced broad social and economic reforms.
Saguisag acknowledged that substantial disaffection remains but
``it is nowhere like the disenchantment with Marcos, which was
across the board.''
   Even more than a debacle for the rebels, the arrests are seen as
a morale booster for the underpaid, ill-equipped Armed Forces of
the Philippines. Since Mrs. Aquino took office when a
military-civilian uprising deposed Marcos, the 160,000-member armed
forces has been wracked by divisions that resulted in at least half
a dozen coup attempts.
   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos says those days are over. He
said the arrests show the military is now a united, effective force.
   Ramos spoke before the escape Saturday of former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of a failed coup attempt in
August. Many Filipinos saw the escape as a blow to the prestige and
unity of the armed forces.
   The significance of Tuesday's arrests may well depend on the
accuracy of intelligence reports of a bitter power struggle within
rebel ranks.
   According to military officials, the infighting is between those
favoring violent struggle and others who want the movement to
expand politically among the rural population.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, the capital's chief law enforcer,
predicted that Tuesday's arrests will deepen divisions among the
rebels because each faction will blame the other for the setback.
   Much also depends on how much foreign assistance flows to the
rebels. Military officials say the funds come from leftist groups
in Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
   Richard Armitage, U.S. assistant defense secretary, told a
congressional committee in Washington this week that the Soviets
were sending money. Soviet diplomats here deny the charge.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
indicted strongman of Panama, may be running out of time and
options in his stubborn quest to remain in power.
   The man President Reagan once called a ``tin-horn dictator'' so
far has relied on brute force, threats and intimidation to maintain
his grip on the nation.
   But despite another harsh crackdown on his opposition last week,
many diplomatic and other observers feel Noriega can count his
remaining days on his fingers and toes.
   ``He really doesn't have anywhere to turn,'' said one Western
diplomat late last week. ``He is almost totally without meaningful
support, either within the country or abroad.''
   Still, Noriega has withstood four weeks of mounting economic
pressure with such mulish defiance that another foreign diplomat,
also speaking on condition of anonymity, was led to comment:
   ``This guy's proving to be harder to get rid of than fleas on a
dog. The problem is becoming one of whether you have to kill the
dog before the fleas will leave.''
   Even Elliott Abrams, the State Department official masterminding
the U.S. effort to oust Noriega, acknowledged last week that he and
others in the Reagan administration had misjudged the general's
staying power.
   Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for Latin American
affairs, said the miscalculation was based in part on the
successful use of economic pressure to remove presidents Ferdinand
E. Marcos from the Philippines and Jean-Claude Duvalier from Haiti.
   The United States has cut off all economic and military aid to
Panama, withheld about $6.5 million a month in user fees from the
Panama Canal, helped tie up more than $50 million in government
funds on deposit in U.S. banks and eliminated some trade
preferences.
   Abrams suggested the time had come to consider even harsher
economic sanctions, up to a total trade embargo. That's a bridge
the administration so far has been unwilling to cross for fear of
so badly damaging the country that a post-Noriega government would
be unable to pick up the pieces.
   ``We now realize that it is easier to remove civilian dictators
than military ones,'' Abrams said. ``In analogous circumstances,
Marcos and Duvalier were gone already.''
   Some foreign diplomats in Panama don't see the situation here as
analogous to the Philippines and Haiti, regardless of any possible
differences between civilian and military dictators.
   ``In the Philippines, you had a Cory Aquino, who provided a
rallying point,'' said one, referring to Philippines President
Corazon Aquino. ``There's nobody like that here. There also aren't
many people here who appear willing to risk their lives in the
struggle. In the Philippines and Haiti we saw desperate people
acting desperately.''
   The diplomats and two private economists, all of whom spoke on
condition of anonymity, agreed there is little chance of U.S.
military intervention, despite Reagan's decision late last week to
send an additional 1,300 soldiers to Panama to help the 10,500
already here guard the Panama Canal and protect American civilians.
   Indeed, only a day before Reagan announced his decision to send
the new troops, the Panamanian government issued a communique
saying it had no intention of provking an excuse for U.S. military
action.
   The diplomats and economists also agreed unanimously that
Noriega's days are numbered by a rapidly souring economy that
already has the general trapped in a fiscal maze with no outlet.
   Panama went bankrupt last year, unable to make interest payments
to any of the lenders to whom it owes $4.8 billion, one of the
highest per capita debts in the world.
   Then, early this year, Noriega was indicted by two federal grand
juries in Florida that accused him of selling out his country to
Colombian drug traffickers in exchange for millions of dollars in
bribes.
   After some weeks of apparent soul searching, Panama's president,
Eric Arturo Delvalle, called for Noriega's dismissal, only to have
the effort backfire with his own ouster in a thinly disguised coup
orchestrated by the general.
   Three weeks ago, Abrams' chief deputy, William Walker, and a
State Department legal officer came to Panama and offered Noriega a
deal: Accept offered asylum in Spain and the United States will not
pursue you.
   The general refused.
   Delvalle's ouster triggered a run on banks that forced their
closure. The government, short of cash, could not pay its
employees. Some disgruntled officers tried but failed to overthrow
Noriega. And his civilian opposition heaped coals on the fire with
a two-week general strike that began to crumble only late last week.
   Even with the anticipated reopening of most industries and
businesses this week, the government and its people are so short of
money and so unlikely to get a big cash infusion that there is no
hope of a return to ``normalcy'' anytime soon.
   ``What we're seeing here is a revolution in slow motion,'' said
one diplomat. ``It may be taking longer than anyone expected, but
it's happening.''

<HEAD>Failed Stakeout Of I-75 Cat Burglar Results In Probation For
Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police patiently watched a stolen
motorcycle for 17 days, 24 hours a day, in hopes of catching a
burglar linked to nearly 200 break-ins, until one officer took a
two-minute restroom break and the bike disappeared.
   Two Alachua County sheriff's investigators involved in the
failed surveillance were placed on six months of probation.
   The so-called Interstate 75 cat burglar, a cocky thief who
police believe has occasionally helped himself to a snack while his
victims slept soundly, has been linked to more than 180 break-ins
in seven Florida counties along I-75. He remains at large.
   Alachua County investigators had their best shot at catching him
in January, when a motorcycle stolen in Citrus County during one of
the cat burglar's sprees was found at a Gainesville apartment
complex, the Gainesville Sun reported Saturday.
   Teams of officers kept watch over the motorcycle from a motor
home 125 yards away to see if the burglar would return to use it.
   But Sgt. William ``Bear'' Bryan and Investigator Tony Canchola
said Friday that a combination of incredible luck on the burglar's
part and a poor line of sight from their vantage point combined to
doom the surveillance.
   The $2,000 motorcycle was discovered parked at the apartment
complex on Jan. 9. One resident remembered seeing a man drive away
on it on the same day the cat burglar struck a Gainesville
neighborhood, and it was later returned to the complex.
   Bryan and Canchola said the discovery of the motorcycle was the
only real break in the I-75 cat burglar cases, which have
frustrated authorities since November.
   So two deputies at a time kept vigil, with the aid of a
television camera and night-vision scope.
   Bryan and Canchola even took the precaution of disabling the
motorcycle's engine so it couldn't be started.
   On Jan. 16, Canchola was watching the TV monitor while Bryan sat
in the back of the motor home repairing other surveillance
equipment, they said Friday. Canchola saw no one near the
motorcycle, so he went to the bathroom for about two minutes. By
the time both men got back to the monitor, the motorcycle was gone.
   ``We were so shocked that we were laughing,'' Canchola said.
``We thought somebody had moved the motorcycle and was playing a
joke on us.''
   Interviews with witnesses later revealed the cat burglar had
snatched the motorcycle in a matter of seconds.
   The suspect drove up in a small pickup truck and parked just out
of the investigators' line of sight. Then, without trying to start
the disabled motorcycle, he wheeled it to his truck and lifted it
in the back.
   The cat burglar did not hit Gainesville that night, when
law-enforcement agencies were at full alert.
   The motorcycle was later found abandoned in Port Orange, south
of Daytona Beach. Alachua County sheriff's spokesman Spencer Mann
said that city had several night burglaries at that time, but they
have not been positively linked to the I-75 cat burglar.
   Canchola and Bryan wound up on probation and said Friday they
still feel bad about losing their best chance at collaring the
burglar.
   ``If we'd have caught him, we'd have been heroes,'' Bryan said.
   Instead, ``we just got burned this time,'' Canchola said.

<HEAD>Lebanon Reportedly Becomes Big Heroin Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon, long known as a supplier of hashish,
has become one of the world's big heroin centers in the past few
years as its economy and central government have collapsed, U.S.
officials said.
   ``Almost all the militias are involved in some way in the
trafficking of drugs,'' one intelligence official said.
   Several officials _ from the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Agency
and the State Department _ agreed to provide an overview of the
drug situation in Lebanon on the condition their names not be used.
   Lebanon's role in the world's drug trade is discussed in the
State Department's March report on narcotics.
   ``Lebanon is reportedly the world's major producer of hashish,
as well as a key processing and transit point for heroin,'' the
department said in its report, called ``International Narcotics
Control Strategy Report.''
   Although Lebanon has yet to approach places like Colombia,
Pakistan and Mexico in the volume of its drug trade, officials said
the situation is worrisome because the United States has virtually
no influence in the country, much of which is controlled by
Christian, Druze and Moslem factions.
   The United States has few statistics about Lebanon's drug trade,
but it reportedly is a more than $200 million-a-year business. The
Christians have long dominated the country's drug business, but
other sects have moved into the business.
   Syria, one of four countries under U.S. sanctions for failing to
cooperate in the war on drugs, has peace-keeping troops in parts of
Lebanon. The other countries on the sanctions list are Iran, Panama
and Afghanistan.
   So chaotic is the situation in Lebanon that Yonah Alexander, an
expert on drugs and terrorism, described the country as ``turning
back to the Middle Ages.'' Alexander is at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a think tank.
   ``The central government ... has little control over the
countryside where armed militia factions and Syria hold sway,'' the
State Department said in its report.
   The department said that much of Lebanon's drug activity occurs
in the fertile Bekaa Valley, a region that is controlled by the
Syrian military and was once the country's breadbasket.
   Syrian military officers ``profit from the trade and protect
it,'' the report said.
   The Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian faction of Shiite Moslems thought
to hold some of the American hostages in Lebanon, also has bases
and support in the Bekaa. In 1986, DEA agents were involved in a
failed attempt to contact and pay the kidnappers in exchange for
hostages.
   Poppy cultivation has replaced the growing of fruits and
vegetables in some of the Bekaa's fields, and farmers find it
easier to make money cultivating drugs and producing foodstuffs,
officials say.
   ``We have seen over the last few years a shift from traditional
agricultural products to ... more poppy,'' one department officer
said. With decline of the Lebanese pound, cultivating drugs has
become a ``very lucrative, safe way of work,'' he said.
   Growing drugs is less hassle for farmers, too. Marketing is not
a problem because the buyers often come to the source and pay cash,
the official said.
   As a result of drug money, the Bekaa has become a
self-sufficient region within the tiny country, which is about the
size of Connecticut. ``The farmers are very independent,'' often
setting up schools and buying big-ticket items like electric
generating equipment, an American said.
   The Bekaa has many of the country's heroin processing plants of
which there are as many as 10. ``Lebanon is not only a grower but
also an importer of drugs,'' an American said. Imported drugs come
primarily from Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
   Drugs are often shipped out of Lebanon through ports controlled
by various militias. The DEA's interdiction program based in
Cyprus, about 60 miles off Lebanon's coast, has successfully halted
some trafficking.
   As a result, Lebanese middlemen increasingly have relied on
female couriers who leave the country overland through Turkey or by
plane with small amounts of drugs in body cavities or concealed in
some fashion.
   Drugs from Lebanon usually end up in the United States, Europe
of Egypt, officials say. But often couriers travel through Africa
before reaching their final destination, enforcement officials say.
   Countries in West Africa have large Lebanese colonies. Addis
Ababa, the Ethiopia's capital, and Nairobi, the Kenya's capital,
are favorite transit points for drug dealers from Lebanon and
elsewhere because of their good airport facilities, officials say.
   Lebanon's burgeoning drug trade has led to more addicts inside
the country, particularly among the militias and the young, college
crowd. The Bekaa farmers, however, seem to have little use for drug
consumption.
   U.S. officials are not optimistic about making a dent in
Lebanon's drug trade anytime soon.
   ``A comprehensive eradication and interdiction program must
await restoration of central government control,'' the State
Department's report said.
   Official U.S. policy calls for national reconciliation in
Lebanon and removal of all foreign forces.
   But drugs contribute to the breakdown in central order by giving
the militias and factions an outside source of income, making them
more flexible and independent. The traditional way for the private
militias to finance their operations is through local taxation.
   ``In the long run, this (drugs) contributes to the emerging
partitioning of the country,'' one official said.

   The effort to push stock market crash
legislation through Congress before lawmakers become preoccupied
with the summer political conventions has produced some strange
bedfellows.
   Nicholas Brady, chairman of President Reagan's task force on the
crash, has teamed with two of the administration's sharpest
critics: Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., and Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee.
   Brady's Republican credentials are impeccable. He is a former
Republican senator from New Jersey, a member of Vice President
George Bush's inner circle and a likely prospect for secretary of
the Treasury in a Bush presidency.
   Yet on the issue of reforming the nation's financial markets, he
finds himself working closely with Proxmire, whose ``Golden
Fleece'' awards regularly skewer administration money-wasting, and
Markey, who made his name as a severe critic of the government's
nuclear power bureaucracy and is now turning his attention to the
regulation of the financial markets.
   Arrayed against Brady's proposals are three Reagan appointees:
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder and Commodity Futures
Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm.
   All three have praise for Brady's research, but all three are
vigorously opposing his proposals for changes in their agencies'
jurisdiction.
   Two months ago, under the glare of television lights in a Senate
hearing room, Brady uttered his now well-known warning regarding
the fragility of the stock market: ``We are looking down the barrel
of a gun, and the gun is still loaded.''
   Since then, at every hearing the lanky Wall Street investment
banker attends, he hears his words repeated by a Democrat eager to
prod a laissez faire Reagan administration into action.
   Brady would clearly like to see legislation providing more
uniform regulation of the markets, but he is just as clearly
uncomfortable at hearing his words used as a political club against
the administration.
   After one hearing, where Markey mixed lavish praise of Brady
with complaints of administration foot-dragging, Brady joked to
reporters: ``I didn't say anybody was going to pull the trigger.''
   The administration has created a working group to resolve
differences among the regulatory agencies. It is due to report to
the president by mid-May.
   But both Markey and Proxmire have painted the creation of the
group as a delaying tactic by an administration that doesn't want
to offend entrenched interests and is prone to be skeptical of
government regulation in the first place.
   Brady says the working group isn't a bad idea, but nevertheless
he has helped Markey and Proxmire write bills that will be finished
before the administration is ready to make its recommendations.
   Markey's bill is still being written, but Proxmire introduced
his on Thursday. It would create an intermarket coordination
committee and instruct the regulatory agencies to cooperate with it.
   Opposition from the agencies as well as infighting among
legislators representing competing interests make the bill's
prospects appear dim.
   But because of Brady's efforts, the sides are drawn less along
party lines than some had expected.
   The day before Proxmire introduced his bill, Brady was on the
floor of the Senate drumming up support. As a result, five of the
bill's seven co-sponsors are Republicans.

   Margie had a little lamb, little lamb,
little lamb.
   Then another and another.
   Now, Bill and Marge Lange's rare quintuplet lambs are the star
attraction in this small town in southeastern North Dakota.
   ``It was like Grand Central Station,'' Mrs. Lange said. ``The
day after they were born we had 10 people call to see if they were
all right. I've had people bring their kids from town to see the
lambs.''
   ``The ewe was perplexed when she first got up and saw all those
babies,'' she said. ``She looked one way and then the other. It was
unreal.''
   Lamb quints are a rare event, occuring about once in 600,000
deliveries, said Bert Moore, professor of animal and range science
at North Dakota State University.
   The four females and one male are all healthy and hungry, Mrs.
Lange said. The five are being fed by the ewe and bottle-fed with
lamb milk replacement by Mrs. Lange, who said she feels like a
mother again.
   ``I was a nervous wreck the first two days, but I'm fine now,''
she said. ``Saturday night I had to go somewhere, so I called a
babysitter to take care of my lambs. I get up every four hours at
night to feed them. But they're eating more and more hay and oats,
so soon I'll just feed them once a night.''
   Fecundity is in the blood line. The sire and the ewe were both
triplets, so there's no telling how large a litter the newborn
lambs may eventually have, Mrs. Lange said.

   For Corrina Clark, long distance really
was the next best thing to being there.
   Clark, who was in Bartholomew County Courthouse, married Alvin
McGowan, who was at an army base in Kaiserslaughtern, West Germany,
over the telephone Thursday, exactly one year after the couple met
by chance in Houston.
   The bride, a native of Indianapolis, said she wanted their
marriage certificate to show that the ceremony took place in
Indiana.
   ``I've done a lot of marriages before, but never one by phone,''
said County Clerk Naomi Jackson, who performed the ceremony. ``My
last thing was `kiss the bride' and I couldn't say that.''
   The couple will exchange vows in person, and seal it with a
kiss, when they repeat the ceremony in Paris this fall.
   The trans-Atlantic telephone call was offered to the couple as a
gift from Columbus attorney Richard Eynon's office.

<HEAD>FCC Says It's Running Out of Viable Dial-A-Porn Complaints to
Investigate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
begun investigating two more California dial-a-porn services, but
the agency says it is running out of complaints it can act on.
   ``I keep beating the bushes for new, specific complaints, but we
just don't have a lot of them,'' though the agency gets plenty of
general complaints about dial-a-porn, said Greg Vogt, chief of the
FCC's telephone enforcement division.
   For the FCC to investigate possible violations of a federal law
prohibiting transmission of sexually explicit messages to children,
the agency needs information such as a phone bill and a statement
that someone under 18 has reached the service without using a
credit card, an access code or a descrambler, he said.
   ``I know there are violations out there, and I would love for
concerned citizens to help us by bringing them to our attention
because there is no way we can locate them in any other way,'' he
said.
   The FCC has jurisdiction over dial-a-porn when the calls cross
state lines or are to, from or within the District of Columbia.
Local calls are under the jurisdiction of the state.
   Complaints about dial-a-porn services have prompted many states
to require telephone companies to block access to 976 and 900
numbers for residential customers who request it. Phone companies
also have been responding to public pressure to disconnect or
otherwise limit the availability of these services.
   The FCC sent letters last week to two California adult-message
services advising them of ``apparent'' violations. They were given
30 days to respond.
   If violations are found, the FCC could levy fines of up to
$50,000 per day for each day a violation occurred.
   The companies cited are Ramrod Enterprises Inc. of Redding,
Calif., and 2001 Enterprises of Reseda, Calif. Neither company was
listed with telephone directory assistance and the FCC said it was
unable to obtain phone numbers for the companies or their owners.
   The actions against both companies stemmed from the same
complaint that generated an investigation, begun last Dec. 7, of
another California provider of sexual messages, Intercambio Inc. of
San Jose, Calif.
   The complaint was from parents of a 16-year-old Connecticut boy
who had made more than 280 calls to dial-a-porn services. The
family was not identified.
   The complaint says the boy lost ``all respect for women in
general'' as a result of the dial-a-porn messages he heard and is
now seeing a psychiatrist.
   The FCC requires dial-a-porn providers to use an access code
available only to adults or prepay with a credit card before they
listen to the sexually explicit messages. The FCC also allows
providers to scramble the messages so they can be heard only by
someone with a descrambling device.
   The complaint against Intercambio and a separate one citing
Audio Enterprises of Mill Valley, Calif., are pending while the
commission re-evaluates the companies' messages in light of a
federal appeals court ruling in January that the agency can
restrict access only to obscene messages, but not indecent ones.
   The commission defines indecency as ``language or material that
depicts or describes ... sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   Obscene material must appeal to the prurient interest, depict or
describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lack
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

   Chinese army officers will trade in their Mao
suits for Western-style jackets and ties this summer, the army
newspaper said Sunday.
   The Liberation Army Daily said Wang Yingbo, one of the
designers, described the new uniform as a Western-style jacket
nipped in at the waist, with a white shirt and black tie.
   Wang said it follows the style used by most other armies in the
world.
   Army officers currently wear olive-green Mao suits with red trim.
   China's military has been acquiring a new look in more ways than
one. Since 1980, it has trimmed its ranks by 25 percent, to 3
million soldiers, retired scores of aging officers, raised the
education requirements for younger officers and increased its use
of computers and high-tech weapons.

<HEAD>Drivers Owe Major Cities More Than $1.5 Billion in Unpaid Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM GILLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a big-city motorist's nightmare: driving aimlessly for an
hour or more seeking a legal parking space. Many succumb to the
temptation of stopping in front of a hydrant or in a ``no parking''
zone.
   Then begins the gamble: will they get caught, and if so, do they
pay up?
   An Associated Press check of 13 major U.S. cities showed that
they collect at least $380 million annually in parking fines, but
many violators ignore the tickets and the backlog of unpaid fines
totals more than $1.55 billion in New York and Los Angeles alone.
   The amounts the two cities do collect in a year would be enough
to finance the budgets of many smaller cities; New York collected
an all-time high of $177 million in 1987 and Los Angeles brought in
nearly $59 million.
   Some other large cities are good collectors, too: Washington got
$38 million last year; Chicago, $24 million; San Francisco, $28
million; Philadelphia, $21.6 million.
   ``Cities have two purposes in imposing parking fines,'' said
John Tepper Marlin, vice president of the National Civic League in
New York. ``First, to keep the traffic flowing. Second, to collect
revenues.''
   Officials at New York's Parking Violations Bureau don't forgive
or forget; they refuse to write off about $1.4 billion in parking
penalties dating back eight years. Los Angeles officials say their
city is owed nearly $157 million in parking fines.
   Last month, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley demonstrated how
cities use fines to persuade drivers to improve their parking
habits. He announced that fines for illegal parking during rush
hours would be nearly doubled, from $28 to $53.
   Bradley said the city expects to collect an additional $6
million in the next year from the higher fines, which are aimed at
motorists who clog the right lanes of major streets. He proposed
using much of the revenue for improvements, such as building
left-hand turn pockets, that would ease congestion.
   In Detroit, under a plan that took effect last week, 52,000
scofflaws with six or more unpaid parking tickets will have to pay
their fines or lose their right to update, renew or replace their
driver's licenses.
   Payments of parking fines rose from $386,000 in December to
$956,000 in January after Mayor Coleman Young announced the plan.
City officials estimate that some 60,000 drivers owe $24 million in
unpaid parking fines.
   Boston officials said a similar non-renewal system has helped
improve its collection percentage of parking fines from 20 percent
to between 65 and 75 percent.
   Many cities also nab illegally parked cars with such measures as
towing. Indianapolis tows some 19,000 cars a year; any car with
more than six tickets automatically goes on the towing list.
   ``We have a rather aggressive system,'' said William Eubanks,
who instituted a computerized tracking system 12 years ago when he
took charge of city's Traffic Violations Bureau.
   However, towing cars can backfire. About 15 percent of the cars
impounded in Grand Rapids, Mich., are never claimed by their owners.
   Then there's the device known as the Denver Boot (it was first
used there in 1955), which can be locked on the wheel of a
scofflaw's parked car, immobilizing it until unpaid fines are
cleared up.
   San Antonio, Texas, last week joined such cities as Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Pittsburgh that use a boot.
   Kirby Thomas, a San Antonio attorney, refused to believe his car
should have been ``booted.'' The week before, he said, he had paid
$63 for six delinquent tickets.
   However, a check of city records showed that he owned a second
car with eight overdue tickets. Thomas paid $89 in fines for his
second car and $35 to remove the boot from the car he was driving.
   A month earlier, after a drop in the number of parking tickets
issued by police was partly blamed for a city budget crisis,
Houston began to use the boot to corral cars whose owners had three
or more unpaid tickets.
   On the first day the device was used, 70 drivers were ``booted''
and had to pay $100 just to have the device removed.
   Cities also use the carrot-and-stick technique to encourage
scofflaws to pay their fines.
   Chicago collected $5 million last year in an amnesty period that
allowed delinquents to pay tickets at half price. In St. Paul,
Minn., where an estimated $2.5 million in parking tickets is owed,
an amnesty program last year brought in about $140,000. And Miami,
owed a similar figure in tickets, offers an annual amnesty period
in which it waives late fees for those who pay up.
   Many cities do not know how much they collect or how much they
are owed because of divided jurisdictions or because parking
statistics are lumped in with other vehicular violations.

   The Democratic presidential candidates want to
increase pressure on South Africa to force change in that nation,
while George Bush generally favors pursuing the Reagan
administration's policies, a survey says.
   The Investor Responsibility Research Center's survey said the
Democrats _ Jesse Jackson, Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore _ differ
dramatically from Bush, the likely GOP nominee, on what U.S. policy
should be toward South Africa and the region.
   The center is a public policy group that tracks issues and
investment in South Africa, a country where blacks are denied
social and political rights through a system known as apartheid.
   The country's racial segregation has attracted interest in
United States, particularly among the black voters who have turned
out in force for Jackson.
   Jackson's successes in the primaries ensure that the candidates'
positions on South Africa, Mozambique and Angola will be
scrutinized in 1988.
   Jackson, who is black, has long stressed support for the
oppressed in South Africa.
   The survey, which was based on the candidates' statements and a
questionnaire, show that Vice President Bush for the most part
endorses the policies the administration has pursued over the last
seven years.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, Bush's only rival
for the GOP nomination, is the sole candidate seeking to repeal the
1986 sanctions that Congress slapped on white-ruled South Africa.
Robertson, however, has done poorly in the primaries and is not
expected to win the nomination.
   In contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats want the United
States to pursue a tougher line against South Africa.
   Gore, a Tennessee senator who portrays himself a moderate, is
less extreme than Jackson and Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor.
The latter two agree on many points.
   Here is a breakdown of the candidates' positions, according to
the survey.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sanctions and Disinvestment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson and Dukakis want additional sanctions against Pretoria
if South Africa does not end its state of emergency, release
political prisoners, remove the ban on the African National
Congress _ the outlawed political organization based in Lusaka,
Zambia _ and enter into negotiations to repeal the apartheid laws.
   The two also have spoken in favor of U.S. companies pulling out
of South Africa.
   Gore is more equivocal about more sanctions, saying he would
consider them if South Africa shows ``no real and dramatic
progress.'' He said companies should make their own decisions on
disinvestment.
   Bush would not recommend additional sanctions, but he wouldn't
repeal those put in place in 1986. The House is considering a
sanctions bill that amounts to a total embargo on South Africa.
   Bush suggests the ``use of diplomacy and negotiations for
constructive change rather than impose additional sanctions.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The African National Congress</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats pledge to have routine dialogue with the ANC. They
also say Pretoria should negotiate with the ANC and other groups.
   Bush says he would continue the Reagan administration's periodic
diplomatic contacts with the ANC.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Angola</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis and Jackson want to stop U.S. aid to the anti-communist
UNITA rebels headed by Jonas Savimbi, and, if elected, they would
extend diplomatic recognition to the Soviet-backed Angolan
government.
   Gore says he is troubled with the aid to the rebels, but that
they must be incorporated into a political settlement. He does not
promise to recognize the Angolan government.
   Bush supports aid to the rebels as a way of blocking Soviet
encroachment in Africa. He would not recognize Luanda in an effort
to compel the Angolans to begin talks with UNITA and expel 40,000
Cuban troops from the country.
   Bush views the Cuban troops as the most important obstacle to
peace in the region. Dukakis and Jackson say that a South African
pullout from Namibia could lead to a Cuban withdrawal. South Africa
maintains their troops in Namibia to protect the country from the
Cubans in Angola.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Mozambique</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush and the Democrats agree with the Reagan administration's
policy of backing the Mozambique government instead of the Renamo
rebels, who are reportedly aided by South Africa.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats favor restoration of economic aid to Zimbabwe. Aid
was cut off in mid-1986 after Zimbabwean officials insulted former
President Jimmy Carter at a Fourth of July party.

   Pope John Paul II made an emotional plea for
peace, justice and human rights Sunday in an Easter message from a
rain-soaked balcony overlooking 100,000 people in St. Peter's
Square.
   After a solemn Mass inside St. Peter's Basilica, attended by
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the pope wished the world
a happy Easter in 52 languages.
   The Mass, usually held outdoors on the flower-decked steps of
St. Peter's, was moved inside Christendom's largest church because
of rain.
   John Paul then appeared on the church's central balcony,
unprotected from the steady drizzle, and addressed an estimated
100,000 people in the square and millions more following by
television and radio around the world.
   At the end of his traditional Easter message ``Urbi and Orbi''
(To The City of Rome and the World), the pope departed from his
written text and made a special plea to the Virgin Mary.
   ``Pray for peace in the world, for justice, pray for the rights
of man, especially for religious freedom, for every man, for every
Christian and non-Christian, pray for us,'' John Paul said,
speaking in Italian in a strong, emotional voice.
   ``Pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world, the first
world, second, third and fourth, all the world,'' he continued.
``In yours and our Easter joy, we carry again this weight of
humanity, this weight of so many human hearts, our brothers, our
sisters, and we repeat: pray for us.''
   Later, in another impromptu remark, the pope thanked those
following on television and radio and urged them to ``pray to Mary
and with Mary for all the people, all the families, all the people
who suffer, especially for those countries where peace, justice and
the means are lacking.''
   Earlier in his prepared message, the pope also addressed his
words to Mary, for whom he has a special devotion and dedicated the
current Marian Year.
   ``Christ whom you bore is risen, hallelujah,'' said the pope,
wearing a white robe trimmed with gold and a tall, gold bishop's
hat. ``Queen of heaven, rejoice. This is the day of the church's
Easter joy. We all share in your glory, oh mother.''
   After a warm, sun-drenched early spring, winter returned to Rome
this weekend, with a cold rain drenching the capital Sunday morning
and dampening the spirits of the hundreds of thousands of tourists
visiting the capital for Easter.
   It was decided at the last moment to move the Easter Sunday Mass
inside the basilica, where the pope celebrated the service from an
altar under the ``Baldacchino,'' the immense Baroque canopy
designed by Bernini.
   Shultz, an Episcopalian, and his wife Helena, a Roman Catholic,
were in the front row of the packed church. Mrs. Shultz was among
those taking communion from the pope.
   Shultz left later in the day for Israel on the first part of his
new Middle East peace shuttle. In a private audience at the Vatican
on Saturday, the pope had given Shultz his blessing for the mission.
   A choir sang Byzantine verses in the ancient Slavic language
Paleoslavonic, the first time they had been sung in Rome at a papal
ceremony since the ninth century.
   Vatican officials said it was meant to show solidarity with
Christians celebrating the 1,000th anniversary of their faith in
what is now the Soviet Union.
   The crowd in the square broke into loud cheers and chants of
``Viva il Papa'' (Long live the pope) when John Paul, keeping with
tradition, appeared on the balcony at noon to deliver his Easter
message and blessing.
   Afterwards, the polyglot pope offered brief Easter greetings in
52 languages ranging from English to Ukrainian to Swahili.
   The longest and final greeting was in his native Polish,
addressed to ``all my fellow countrymen in my country and all
around the world and to all those who in the midst of adversity and
anxiety are trying to find a path.''

<TEXT>
   It's a grand wake for those who share
the pain of Rep. Billy Tauzin's dashed hopes for the governor's
seat _ a cruise into the sunset to retire some of his $1.1 million
campaign debt.
   The six-day outing leaving Monday for the Mexican resorts of
Cozumel and Cancun is a smaller-scale version of former Gov. Edwin
Edwards' 1983 trip to Paris and Monte Carlo.
   Edwards retired a $4 million debt as backers almost tripped over
each other to pay $10,000 for the ride. But Tauzin said he will net
only $250,000 from his trip aboard the Canada Star, which costs a
mere $3,000 to $6,000 a head.
   ``It's a chance to be with my people, thank them personally and
also do something nice for those who worked with us,'' the
congressman said in a telephone interview from the tiny coastal
town of Chackbay last week.
   With some wealthy backers paying for tickets they won't use,
Tauzin said he is doling out their tickets to key people who worked
in his 1987 campaign. In all, 250 people will set sail.
   Tauzin also sent letters to lobbyists telling them they would
have a captive audience of several congressmen, who were invited
along free of charge. He said he approached the House and Senate
ethics committee about the trip and the cruise organizers ``will
follow the (ethics) rules strictly.''
   But Tauzin said he wasn't sure how many would show up.
   Wayne Smith, a political consultant, said about 30 cabins had
been sold to Washington politicians and businessmen as of last week.
   The cruise, Tauzin said, is no different from staging a cocktail
party or dinner at a hotel to raise money to pay off campaign debts.
   ``It's a long, extended cocktail party,'' he said.
   Tauzin, along with Edwards, lost the governorship last fall to
Buddy Roemer, who remains behind to deal with a debt no junket is
likely to retire. The almost bankrupt state owes $2 billion.

   New marker posts being installed along the
Oregon Trail no longer bear bronze medallions because they have
become the targets of thieves who fancy them as attractive
ornaments for their belts.
   The medallions were authorized by the Wyoming Historical Society
in the 1950s. Thieves also have taken medallions from markers on
the Mormon Trail and the Pony Express route.
   ``This has been happening all over the state because these
trails run from border to border,'' said Bill Mortimer of the
Bureau of Land Management ``The longer we leave them out there, the
more susceptible they are to vandalism.''
   There are still a few marker posts with medallions, but Mortimer
said he doesn't know where they are.
   ``And if I did know, I probably wouldn't tell you,'' he said.

   The first black chancellor of the
University of Maryland-College Park is resigning to become
president of Occidental College in California.
   John B. Slaughter, 54, informed the Board of Regents on Friday
he is resigning as head of the nation's seventh largest public
college campus to take the presidency at the small liberal arts
college near Los Angeles on Aug. 1.
   Slaughter became chancellor in November 1982, after serving as
head of the National Science Foundation. He sought to increase
recruitment and retention of black students and faculty at the
state's 38,000-student flagship campus, and succeeded in boosting
black full-time enrollment from about 8 percent in 1983 to 12.5
percent last year.
   Students' average SAT scores jumped 50 points during his tenure
and the enrollment of foreign students increased 88 percent, a
university spokeswoman said.

   Air sickness put a damper on the reunion
between an 18-year-old Amerasian and the parents she had not seen
since she was 2 years old.
   Truong Thi Thanh Thuy, daughter of a Little Compton man who
married a Vietnamese wife while in Southeast Asia, was reunited
with her parents Friday at New York's Kennedy airport.
   She appeared solemn and neither smiled nor cried, but her
parents, Bruce and Truong Mason, later learned that she had been
airsick just before the plane landed. She cheered up by the time
they reached New England, Mason said.
   In 1972, Thuy and her parents were separated when the Masons
left Vietnam and thought Thuy would be able to follow on the next
flight. But red tape and the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese
held up her departure.
   Thuy had been living with her grandparents, uncle, aunt and two
cousins, all of whom left Vietnam with her.

   After investigators found four people shot
to death at an Athens farm and a 70-year-old woman missing last
July, the sheriff said, ``You find me Helen, and I'll probably tell
you what happened.''
   Last week, investigators found bones in a marsh that they
believe are those of the missing Helen Kunz.
   And now Marathon County Sheriff LeRoy Schillinger says it will
probably be some time before he can tell the public what happened.
   No arrests have been made based on the discovery, but Taylor
County Chief Deputy Sheriff William Breneman predicted there would
be charges.
   ``I'm not sure exactly how soon, but they're coming,'' he said.
   Miss Kunz's son Kenneth says he arrived home after a night of
drinking on July 5 and found his uncle, two aunts and his brother
dead, each shot with a .22-caliber weapon. His mother was missing.
   ``There was no reason for them to do this to my family,''
Kenneth Kunz said last week after the discovery of the remains
believed to be his mother. ``I hope they find who done it.''
   Investigators ruled out robbery as a motive after they found
about $1,000 in the home.
   Neighbors knew little about the family that lived on a 108-acre
farm in a wooden house off a dirt road in central Wisconsin. The
family rarely invited people into the cluttered house but did most
of their business at the door, neighbors said. Kenneth Kunz, 55,
lived in a trailer next to the house.
   The house had a wood stove and no indoor plumbing. But merchants
said Helen Kunz had bought a videocassette recorder and microwave
oven for the family.
   Hardware store owner Gale Weiler said the woman also bought
.22-caliber ammunition a few weeks before the killings and
complained that her family watched ``dirty movies'' on the VCR. She
said the ammunition was for her younger son, 30-year-old Randy
Kunz, to shoot birds.
   ``You find me Helen and I'll probably tell you what happened,''
Schillinger said just after the killings.
   Miss Kunz, who never married, was described by people in town as
the family matriarch who paid the bills and did laundry while Randy
waited in the car. Randy also accompanied her to high school sports
games.
   Miss Kunz's sisters, Irene, 81, and Marie, 72, were seen less
frequently by neighbors, who remembered the women working in their
garden and wearing old-fashioned clothes. Their brother, Clarence,
76, had been ill and had retired from farming.
   As investigators probed the family's past, questions of incest,
which first arose during a 1930s rape trial, resurfaced and have
yet to be solved.
   Lawyers raised the possibility of incest during the trial of a
40-year- old neighbor whom Helen Kunz, then 15 and pregnant, had
accused of attacking her. Her mother denied the incest accusations
and the neighbor was convicted in 1933 of statutory rape.
   Kenneth Kunz told the Milwaukee Sentinel in an interview after
the killings that he thought Clarence Kunz was his father.
   Authorities based their identification of the remains found last
week on clothing _ ``some tattered, some scattered, some with''
skeletal remains _ found in the marsh about 16 miles north of the
Kunz farm, Lt. Elwood Mason said.
   The bones and clothing were taken to the state crime laboratory
in Madison for forensic tests, expected to take several days.
   Around six months after the killings, police questioned several
people and held a 21-year-old man in jail over a weekend for
interrogation. But they released him without charges and no one
else was arrested.
   In mid-March, investigators gathered reporters from as far away
as Minneapolis and Milwaukee and escorted them to a manure pit,
where authorities dug for three days without finding any evidence.
   Police said a detective found the remains last week on the basis
of information from an informant whom they would not identify.
   Mason and Schillinger said there are more than one but fewer
than a dozen suspects in the case, but would not say if the
discovery of the remains eliminated any suspects or drew their
focus to anyone in particular.
   ``I don't think it adds any new questions,'' said Mason, who has
been heading the investigation. ``We may have eliminated some. You
don't know.''

   Thousands of Roman Catholics
marched peacefully in Northern Ireland on Sunday to commemorate the
1916 Easter Rising against British rule in what is now the Republic
of Ireland.
   Police abandoned a short-lived policy of staying away from
funerals and other occasions organized by sympathizers of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army and mounted heavy patrols around the
main march through the Catholic ghettos of west Belfast.
   Armored Land Rovers, with officers riding shotgun, drove at the
head and tail of the mile-long procession. About 5,000 people,
waving Irish tricolor flags, marched to the sound of pipe bands to
the Catholic Milltown cemetery.
   Police reported no incidents at the parades in Belfast,
Londonderry, the second largest city, and 10 smaller centers across
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   British troops, with rifles cocked, also patrolled the west
Belfast route, lined by Catholics wearing orange, green and white
badges, the tricolor colors, embossed with a lily.
   The flower is the symbol of the 1916 uprising in Dublin. The
uprising led to independence six years later for the overwhelmingly
Catholic republic.
   Britain, at the insistence of Protestants in the north, retained
control of the six northern counties, which now make up Northern
Ireland.
   The Easter Sunday parades marked the start of the annual
marching season in Northern Ireland where Protestants and Catholics
separately commemorate key dates of their troubled history.
   Protestant marches were due to begin Monday.
   In Milltown cemetery, where a Protestant gunman killed three
people in a March 16 attack on an unpoliced IRA funeral, police
ringed marchers as they thronged round a memorial to guerrillas
killed in the IRA's bomb-and-bullet campaign to end British rule.
   ``We have a message for the British government,'' said Martin
McGuinness, vice president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political
wing.
   ``We will demoralize you. We will make your six counties into a
millstone which will strangle you.''
   Police stared silently as the crowd burst into applause when
McGuinness declared:
   ``Our strategy ... is to sap the political will of the British
government and the British people to remain in Ireland. The means
are limited guerrilla warfare against the crown forces.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary ended its no-policing policy after
an upsurge of sectarian violence last month culminated in the
murder of two British soldiers who drove into an IRA funeral March
19.
   Sunday's march passed close to the spot where the two signals
corpsmen, in plainclothes, were dragged from their car by the
funeral mob, beaten and then shot by IRA gunmen.
   The spate of killings, in which 12 people died, began March 6
when British commandos fatally shot three unarmed IRA guerrillas
who were on a bombing mission in the British colony of Gibraltar.
   A total of 2,638 people have been killed since sectarian
violence erupted in 1969.
   McGuinness denied published reports that the IRA is considering
abandoning violence.
   ``The IRA position has been on the record for years,'' he told
reporters. ``They have stated there will be no more cease-fires.''

Save Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberals and conservatives, often at
loggerheads on social programs, are in rare agreement on expanding
eight children's programs, citing independent research that shows
the programs work well and save the government money.
   A report released this weekend by the House Select Committee on
Children, Youth and Families cites specific costs and benefits of
each program as determined by independent research and analysis.
   The findings have convinced liberals and conservatives that they
can be both compassionate and cost-conscious, said Rep. Dan Coates,
R-Ind., the senior Republican on the committee.
   ``We're working toward a consensus here,'' Coates said. ``I've
seen a decided change in attitude ... on the Republican side about
how we should approach the process of spending.''
   Whereas there was wholesale ``spare-no-program'' cutting in the
early years of the Reagan presidency, Coates said, members are more
discriminating now and willing to spend money on programs that work.
   ``Absent these standards, you don't get new money,'' said Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the children's committee and a
member of the House Budget Committee.
   Miller said the House budget resolution provides several hundred
million dollars in increases above inflation for the eight
education, health, nutrition and employment programs.
   The report released this weekend is an update of a 1985 report
and contains 25 additional studies that reinforce the original
findings.
   ``This update gives more credence to the initial effort. It can
serve as a very important guideline to the new administration,''
Coates said.
   The report discusses research findings by universities,
government agencies and other sources in the areas of Medicaid;
supplemental nutrition for pregnant women, infants and children
(WIC); youth employment; preschool education; compensatory
education; handicapped education; prenatal care; and immunizations.
   Miller said the report and the update were prompted by the
skeptical ``prove-it'' reaction encountered by advocates when they
argued that short-term investments would produce long-term savings.
   He said the initial compilation was instrumental in persuading
lawmakers to stop cutting those programs and led to increased
spending on them in subsequent years.
   ``The key is to back it up with research,'' Coates said.
   The largest child-program increases in the House budget
resolution _ a non-binding spending blueprint _ include $210
million for the compensatory education program for children at
academic risk and $170 million for handicapped education. Other
substantial hikes would go to the WIC program ($150 million) and
Head Start ($77 million).
   Among the newer findings cited in the report:
   _National math and reading rankings of students in the
compensatory education program increased in every grade except 12th.
   _It costs only $500 to provide a year of compensatory education
to a student at risk of academic failure while it costs more than
$3,000 for a student to repeat a grade.
   _A pregnant woman not participating in WIC increased her chances
of having a low-birthweight, high-risk baby by 60 percent in one
North Carolina county.
   _For every $1 spent on WIC in Missouri, about 49 cents was saved.
   _The incidence of nutritional anemia virtually disappeared at an
inner city health center from 1971 to 1984; the researcher said 95
percent enrollment in WIC probably was the reason.
   _For every dollar spent on childhood immunization, the
government saves $10 in medical costs.

<HEAD>Singleton's Parole On San Quentin Grounds To End Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For 10 months paroled
rapist-mutilator Lawrence Singleton has lived a hermitlike
existence in a trailer at the state prison, the only place
authorities could find for him after he was driven out of town
after town.
   On April 25, his parole _ and his stay at San Quentin _ will
come to an end. Singleton will be able to walk away a free man,
under no obligation to tell officials where he will settle.
   The 60-year-old ex-convict bears little resemblance to the
burly, hard-drinking ex-sailor convicted of raping and sodomizing
15-year-old hitchhiker Mary Vincent in 1978 and chopping off her
forearms with an ax.
   Today, he lives on a small Social Security grant and spends his
days tending the yard around his trailer in a remote corner of the
1,000-acre prison grounds.
   Although not formally under guard, he observes a 10 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew and is watched by at least one parole officer when he
leaves the grounds for weekly visits to a psychologist, officials
said.
   ``When he wants to go shopping, he asks us because he has no
transportation,'' said Ronald Chun, regional parole administrator
for the Department of Corrections. ``Technically, we have him under
surveillance. He can walk around on his own, but for all practical
purposes we are escorting him.''
   ``If it weren't for the press calls, we wouldn't know he was out
there,'' said prison spokesman Dave Langerman. ``Out of sight is
out of mind. Anyone out on the streets has more to fear from the
unknown _ the guy with the tattoo next to them in the supermarket _
than from this poor little burned-out guy under escort.''
   Singleton does not grant interviews, but has had occasional
visitors, including ex-wife Mary Collins, a retired nurse who
offered him a home but was refused by parole authorities, said
Michael Van Winkle, a Corrections spokesman.
   Singleton served nine years, 11 months of a 14-year, four-month
sentence in the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo,
receiving an early release for good behavior and through a
work-credit program, Chun said.
   The early release infuriated residents of a half-dozen small
communities where authorities tried to place Singleton last spring.
In Rodeo, about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, a mob of 500
people forced officers to move Singleton under armed guard from a
hotel room.
   Finally, in June, Gov. George Deukmejian ordered Singleton
placed at San Quentin for the duration of his one-year parole.
   Once his parole ends, Singleton is under no obligation to tell
officials whether he will settle in Florida, near relatives, or
elsewhere, Chun said.
   ``I hope he goes to Florida. The victim and her parents will
feel much better knowing he is gone,'' said Nancy Fahden, a Contra
Costa County supervisor who fought Singleton's release to her
county.
   Vincent, who now has a child, declined to be interviewed but
said last year, before Singleton was paroled, that she still fears
her attacker.
   As a condition of his parole, Singleton takes a drug that would
make him extremely ill from any amount of alcohol, even if splashed
on in an aftershave lotion, Langerman said.
   ``He is completely, absolutely defused as a threat to society,''
the spokesman said. ``If he takes a drink, he will fall down
retching, so you don't have to worry about him going on a bender
and going out looking for a hitchhiker.''
   But once Singleton's parole ends, he is not required to continue
the drug, called disulfiram, Chun said.
   ``Yes, there is a concern. He claims he doesn't really need it.
He doesn't lose that much control, according to him,'' Chun said.
Singleton maintains, as he did at his trial, that he is innocent
and was mistaken for another man.
   ``I think, if anything, he's worse now,'' said Donald Stahl, the
Stanislaus County prosecutor at Singleton's trial.
   ``He has not taken responsibility,'' Stahl said. ``He lives in a
bizarre fantasy land and acquits himself each day. He doesn't
accept his guilt and resolve never to do it again.''

<HEAD>Boy Asks For Quarters For Education To Cure Diabetes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old fifth grader is asking New
Yorkers for quarters to help him become a doctor and find a cure
for the diabetes that killed his grandmother and is sapping the
health of his grandfather.
   Tony Brack sent $10 and this handwritten letter to the New York
Daily News:
   ``Dear Sir,
   ``Can you please print this for me. I hope this $10 will help
the cost for 1 or 2 days in your newspaper.
   ``HELP
   ``I am 10 years old and want to go to college when I grow up. My
grandma died 3 weeks ago from diabetes at 56 years young. I want to
find a cure for diabetes as my other grandpa has it to. Please send
a 25 (cents) and it will grow in the bank until then. Thank you.
   ``Tony Brack
   ``Box 191
   ``Oxford, Iowa 52322''
   The $10 was not enough to cover the cost of a New York Daily
News advertisement, but Tony got his picture and a story about his
plea on page two of Sunday's Daily News.
   Tony was extraordinarily close to his grandmother, Joyce Brack,
said his mother, Dianna Brack.
   Since both his parents work, Tony went to his grandmother's
house, about four blocks from home, every day after school.
   The elder Mrs. Brack, 56, had undergone the amputation of one
leg in January and her eyesight was failing, but she seemed to be
doing well under the circumstances, the family said.
   She died Feb. 1, just hours after having dinner with Tony's
family.
   A couple of weeks later, Tony decided something must be done
about diabetes and that he could be the one to do it.
   The idea of making a public request for funds came from the
syndicated newspaper column of Bob Greene, who wrote about a
college student who gathered thousands of dollars by asking for one
penny from every person who read Greene's column.
   ``He's very serious about becoming a doctor and doing something
about diabetes,'' his mother said. ``He's a nice, sensitive kid who
thinks about people other than himself.''
   Tony told the Daily News: ``I want to go to the University of
Iowa and train to be a doctor. Then I can help stop these bad
things happening.''

   A senior Iranian official said Sunday that
Iran would retaliate for Iraq's renewed attacks on Iranian cities
by launching new ground offensives.
   Iran also revealed that a month of Iraqi air and missile attacks
on Iranian cities has left 1,145 people dead and another 4,000
wounded.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani said any
suggestion that the ``war of the cities'' could change the military
balance is ``a joke.''
   ``They sent more than 100 missiles into Tehran and that could
not change anything,'' he added. By Iraqi count, 105 missiles have
been fired into the Iranian capital.
   Larijani said an Iraqi raid on the northeastern city of Tabriz
330 miles northwest of Tehran killed at least 10 civilians and
wounded 15 others on Sunday.
   Iran's official news media earlier had reported the warplane
raid, as well as another air attack on the central city of Isfahan.
   The raids followed a 2{-day lull in Iraqi attacks on Iranian
cities during a visit to Baghdad by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal. Iran also had largely ceased its attacks on Iraqi cities.
   Asked whether Iran would retaliate for the new raids, Larijani
said: ``We will have plenty of surprises for them,'' but made it
plain that these would come chiefly in the battlefield through
``punitive offensives.''
   ``These offensives will stop them definitely, and they will pay
a high price,'' he told a news conference attended by The
Associated Press.
   Iran periodically allows Western reporters to travel to Tehran.
   He also said Iran has ``anything that is needed'' to prevent the
Iraqis from using chemical weapons against Iranian cities. He did
not elaborate.
   For just over a month Iraq has been pounding the Iranian capital
with Al Hussein missiles, which it says were made in Iraq.
   Western analysts say they are Soviet-made Scud-Bs with boosters
to give them extra range to travel the 290 miles to Tehran.
   Larijani, who is a deputy foreign minister for economic and
international relations, is to meet on Wednesday with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar as part of international
efforts to end the 7{-year-old war.
   He said Iran would continue these discussions in a ``cooperative
mood'' but reiterated Iran's demand for a condemnation of Iraq as
the aggressor in the war.
   ``We are insisting that Baghdad be held accountable for ... a
long list of criminal actions,'' he said. ``We are going to ask for
every bit of our rights.''
   In an earlier meeting with Western reporters, Kamal Kharrazi,
director-general of Iran's War Information Headquarters, said said
Iran's Val-Fajr-10 offensive in mountainous northeastern Iraq had
achieved its objectives and ended after winning control of about
390 square miles of Iraqi territory.
   A Western diplomatic source said he understood that the Iraqis
had began a counteroffensive with the aim of recapturing the town
of Halabja.
   Iraqi reportedly attacked Halabja with chemical weapons after
Iran took it in March.
   A visit to the Halabja area for Western newsmen, which had been
scheduled for Monday, was put off without explanation. No new date
was given.
   Iran claims 5,000 Kurds were killed and another 5,000 injured in
the chemical attacks March 16-17. Iraq has repeatedly denied using
chemical weapons, but also has stressed it is ready to use any
weapons at its disposal to defend Iraqi soil.

   President Reagan and his wife Nancy
spent a quiet Easter Sunday at their secluded ranch in the Santa
Ynez Mountains.
   With with warm temperatures and cloudless skies, Reagan attended
to chores at Rancho del Cielo, the first couple's 688-acre property
about 30 miles from this seaside resort city.
   Reagan, according to the White House press office, was chopping
wood and clearing brush, and then he and the first lady planned a
quiet dinner.
   In contrast to Easter Sunday a year ago, the Reagans did not
venture from the ranch to attend worship services, nor was there
any gathering of relatives at the ranch this time around.
   The press office said that in addition to working on the ranch
grounds, Reagan took care of routine paperwork.
   The president and his wife will travel to Coto de Caza in Orange
County, Calif., Monday to attend a reception and luncheon for the
Reagan library foundation.
   The Reagans arrived in California on Friday and will vacation
until April 10, when they return to the White House.

   Anti-communist Afghan rebel leaders
say the United States has stopped supplying Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles to the guerrillas in apparent anticipation of a settlement
of the Afghan civil war.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, arriving Sunday
in Kabul to confer with Afghan government leaders, said the United
States and Pakistan were blocking talks in Geneva aimed at ending
the eight-year war.
   Mohamad Nabi Mohamadi, leader of the Harekat Islami, one of the
seven guerrilla groups fighting communist forces in Afghanistan,
said the rebels have not been receiving the shoulder-launched
missiles for the last four or five months.
   ``We are extremely worried,'' Nabi Mohamadi told The Associated
Press in a weekend interview at his headquarters in the Pakistani
border city of Peshawar.
   ``We don't trust the Russians. We are afraid because they are
deceitful and sly,'' he said, referring to Soviet claims that they
want to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   However, two other guerrilla leaders said the supply of Stingers
had not stopped.
   The official Soviet Tass news agency said in a commentary that
peace could be brought to Afghanistan without U.S. agreement on a
plan to settle the war.
   The commentary indicates that the Kremlin may be willing to sign
a settlement in Geneva without American assurances that it will
stop shipping weapons to Afghan rebels.
   The United States has said it will halt military aid to the
rebels only when the Soviets stop aiding the communist government
in Kabul.
   Soviet officials contend that economic and military assistance
to the Afghanistan government is a bilateral matter outside the
scope of the Geneva peace talks.
   Shevardnadze told Tass that his discussions with Afghan
President Najib would center on the problems delaying an end to the
war.
   ``Unfortunately, serious difficulties have developed at these
talks because of the non-constructive position taken by Pakistan
and the United States,'' the 60-year-old foreign minister said,
according to Tass.
   In Geneva, the U.N. talks recessed Thursday for the Easter
holiday and were to resume Monday. Pakistan represents the rebels
in the talks.
   Soviet officials had placed high hopes on getting a peace
agreement out of the current round of negotiations that began March
2. But the talks have stalled over the question of foreign military
assistance to the two sides.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
communist government battle the insurgents. Western analysts say at
least 10,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and
more than 20,000 wounded.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered in February to begin
the pullout on May 15 if the settlement plan was signed by March
15. That informal deadline was surpassed when new issues arose at
the Geneva talks.
   The Washington Post reported last week that the U.S. government
intended to stop supplying the rebels with Stingers, which are said
to have dramatically improved the guerrilla's air defenses since
they first acquired the deadly missiles in late 1986.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, said
Reagan administration was nervous about leaving a large number of
the missiles in the hands of Afghan factions that cannot be
controlled after U.S. ties are cut. Some of the missiles have made
their way to Iran.
   In Peshawar, Nabi Mohamadi said he assumed the United States
stopped the missile shipment because of the possible Soviet
withdrawal. He said he believed the supplies would resume if the
Soviets failed to leave Afghanistan.
   But Sebghatollah Mojadeddi, head of the Afghan National
Liberation Front, which is considered moderate, said no halt had
been confirmed.
   ``The United States has promised that it will not leave us alone
and as long as the Russians help the Kabul government, they will
continue helping us,'' Mojaddedi said in an interview.
   Ahmad Gilani, leader of the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said, ``I know that they have not halted the
Stingers.''
   Ahmad Shah, whom the guerrillas have chosen to head a rebel
interim government in Afghanistan if the Soviets leave, said the
halt in the Stingers would not deter the guerrillas from battling
the communists.
   ``We never asked for Stingers,'' he said. ``This was their
decision. When we didn't have the Stingers, we (still) were
fighting and shooting down enemy planes.''
   Yunis Khalis, leader of the Hezbi Islami rebel group, declined
to confirm that the supply of Stingers had been halted. But he
charged the Americans were helping the rebels only to serve their
own interests.
   ``We never stretched our hands out to America for military
help,'' Khalis said.
   Khalis said that even without U.S. aid the rebels ``will
continue their battle.''

   A Soviet customs inspector became suspicious of an
African couple because of their roundabout travel route and found
$10 million worth of heroin packed inside their suitcases, a
newspaper said Sunday.
   Police arrested the couple, from Cotonou, Benin, after the
incident at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported.
   The newspaper did not say when the alleged smuggling attempt
occurred or whether the pair had been formally charged.
   It said more than 32 pounds of heroin was found in five
suitcases carried by the couple. Komsomolskaya Pravda said the
drugs would have a black market value of about $10 million.
   Customs inspector Vyacheslav Chugunov was credited by the
newspaper with discovering the narcotics.
   Chugunov told the newspaper he became suspicious of the couple
when he noticed they were passing through Moscow on a trip home
from New Delhi, which he said was far from the shortest or simplest
route.
   In recent years, there have been several cases of foreigners
arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs through Sheremetyevo
Airport. They generally believe that arrival from Moscow attracts
less attention from customs agents at their final destination.

<HEAD>Federal Court Ruling Threatens Walking Horse Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CONNIE CASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After high-stepping past allegations of
cruelty and abuse for over three decades, the Tennessee walking
horse industry may be stopped in its tracks by a federal court
ruling, officials say.
   Based on the decision of a Washington district judge, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture banned the stacked shoes and limited the
weight of leg chains used to give the show horses their flamboyant
stride.
   The move has crippled the walking horse industry, said Mack
Motes, president of the Walking Horse Trainers Association, which
plans to help fight the court decision.
   ``We're trying to save our breed,'' Motes said.
   Several shows in Alabama and Tennessee have been canceled since
the regulations were announced two weeks ago, and things look grim
for the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. The annual
10-day show, scheduled for late this summer in Shelbyville,
typically attracts more than 2,000 horses from across the country
and is considered the World Series of the breed.
   ``I don't think the celebration could go this year,'' said
Frederick Harper, an animal scientist with the University of
Tennessee Agricultural Extension Service.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ordered the new regulations in
a suit filed by the American Horse Protection Association against
the Agriculture Department.
   The rules forbid the use of bracelet-like chains weighing more
than 6 ounces and padded shoes for racking and walking horses.
Chains of up to 10 ounces and stacked shoes 4 inches high had been
allowed.
   The special shoes and chains are needed to keep the walking
horse industry on its feet, proponents say.
   A horse on stacked shoes ``gives a better show .... That old
horse really gets into it,'' said Reese Smith Jr., spokesman of
Friends of the Show Horse.
   But animal protection activists say chains can cause soreness
and swelling of the leg and that padded shoes, which cover the
horses' hooves, help hide sores. They also can hide objects that
are placed between the horses' hooves and the shoes to cause the
animals pain, said Russ Gaspar, general counsel for the American
Horse Protection Association.
   Many in the industry say they are being penalized for abuses
long since corrected, including the use of chemical irritants in
the 1960s.
   Irritants placed above the hoof combined with chains to make
horses lift their feet up and out in a flamboyant gait called the
``big lick,'' but they also gave the animals raw sores.
   Their widespread use helped push Congress to pass the Horse
Protection Act of 1970, which banned irritants and other soring
practices and prompted the industry to form an elaborate inspection
system for each show.
   Motes said the industry isn't causing sores now and added that
98 percent of horses inspected over the past five years have passed.
   Nevertheless, the judge ruled that horse protection group had
raised doubts about the accuracy of show inspections in the suit.
   USDA spokeswoman Nancy Robinson said the department on Friday
asked Gasch whether the industry could keep using the devices while
the department sets final rules, which could take two months or
more.
   Smith, whose organization has raised over $400,000 and hired
lawyers to fight the court decision, said industry groups do not
know yet exactly how they will fight the decision, but they expect
to challenge it in court.
   Harper estimates the state's economy would lose about $140
million in one year if walking horse shows were wiped out. There
are about 500 shows in the state each year, mostly to benefit
charities, he said.
   ``The walking horse is the only show horse that really attracts
people, they're exciting,'' Smith said. ``We have a special horse.
And we're treated special _ especially bad.''

   A diesel oil spill disappeared Sunday
from the Ohio River as mysteriously as it had appeared, a U.S.
Coast Guard spokesman said.
   ``We can't find a trace of it,'' said Lt. Eric Mosher, who was
part of a team that conducted a land search along a 50-mile stretch
of the river from Louisville to Madison, Ind., where the slick was
spotted Saturday.
   Mosher said the oil seen the previous day was light and tends to
evaporate.
   The search team checked out banks on both sides of the river and
``nothing was found. We still don't know where the slick
originated,'' Mosher said.
   Barges, towboats and holding tanks had been checked but provided
no clues, he said.
   Jerry Ford, a spokesman for the Louisville Water Co., said
powdered activated carbon was added to the treatment process as a
precaution but that no problems were expected with the water supply.
   Madison draws its water from underground streams and was not
affected.
   Sgt. Carroll Henneke of the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources said, ``We've had no fish kill and haven't observed loss
of any marine life.''
   Madison police alerted the Coast Guard to the spill about 7 a.m.
Saturday after receiving a report of a strong diesel smell in the
river Friday evening.
   Initially, there were reports that the spill extended upstream
from Madison, but Mosher said workers at Markland Lock and Dam
about 20 miles upstream from Madison and at McAlpine Lock and Dam
in Louisville were unable to see or smell it.

<HEAD>Dukakis Refuses To Pass Judgment On Jackson's Electability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis says he will criticize fellow
Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson on occasion, but refrained from
doing so on Sunday. He also said no one knows whether Jackson is
could win against Vice President George Bush.
   Dukakis argued that the voters are not interested in fellow
Democrat Albert Gore Jr.'s criticisms of himself and Jackson, and
rejected suggestions that criticism of Jackson would help indicate
what his own values are.
   ``Why is that a test of one's presidential qualities?'' he asked
reporters outside of St. Constantine Church here.
   ``I disagree with Jesse Jackson...and I have expressed those
disagreements and will in the future. But I don't think the
American people have the slightest interest in what Al Gore thinks
of him or of me,'' Dukakis added.
   Gore, a Tennessee senator, criticized Jackson sharply last week
on foreign policy and experience. Dukakis hesitated to do the same,
but said there are several areas in which he and Jackson have
policy disagreements.
   The Massachusetts governor visited three churches on Easter
Sunday, before picking up his campaigning for votes in Tuesday's
Wisconsin primary.
   He dropped in on services at an all-black church and served fish
and fries at a Sunday supper. He also attended services at
Annuciation Greek Orthodox church, which was celebrating Palm
Sunday under his church's calendar. Then Dukakis flew to a farm in
northern Wisconsin before wrapping up his day in Madison.
   The Democratic hopeful was pressed on his judgment of Jackson's
electability, a matter of concern to many Democratic leaders. The
two men are locked in a tight race in Wisconsin.
   Asked if either he or Jackson could beat Bush, he answered:
``Yes, but I think I have best chance of doing so...I think George
Bush is beatable. I'd like to be able to run against him.''
   Then Dukakis was asked if he disagrees with Democrats who say
Jackson is unelectable in November.
   ``I don't think there is any way of telling, based on what we
have seen over the past year...there are no sure things,'' Dukakis
said.
   Asked about the subject again later, he said, ``I make no
predictions.''
   ``I do think I'm the strongest candidate against Bush. I think I
can take the fight to him. I think I can build a very broad
coalition with people... who want somebody who has the skill and
the ability and the experience to do this job, who has balanced
budgets...who has a record. That's my strength in this race.
   ``In the last analysis, what we want is a victory,'' he added.
   Dukakis is leading in the latest polls in Wisconsin, but he said
that is meaningless.
   ``I don't pay attention to polls. There were all kinds of polls
in Michigan that said I was ahead. It's on Tuesday that the people
of this state will decide who will be the strongest nominee and
best president,'' he said.
   Jackson beat Dukakis 2-1 in the Michigan caucuses on March 26
after Dukakis was leading in the polls there.
   Dukakis said he was going to continue to emphasize his positive
message and avoid attacks on other candidates unless he is first
attacked. He said that approach is working for both him and Jackson.
   ``I think it is significant that the two of us who are positive
and hopeful and optimistic about this country are also leading in
this race,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis mentioned three disagreements with Jackson: Middle East
policy, oil import fees and how to provide health insurance for all
Americans.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, launching
a fresh U.S. peace venture, told Israel Sunday night to act on his
plan for negotiations for Palestinian self-rule.
   ``Negotiations work,'' he said in a strong arrival statement.
``The time to act on it is now.''
   Shultz said the Palestinians must be included in the talks and
negotiations must be based on a 1967 United Nations resolution that
calls on Israel to give up territory in exchange for Arab
recognition.
   Shultz acknowledged that the plan he presented last month to
Arab and Israeli leaders on a swing through the region was
difficult for everyone.
   But he said that ``the balance in our approach is evident'' and
that picking on objectionable parts ``is to take a road labeled
delay and frustration.''
   His message was intended for Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who on a trip to Washington in mid-March condemned Shultz's
call for an international peace conference.
   Shultz, quoting from Ecclesiastes, said there is ``a time of war
and time of peace.''
   He said: ``This is the time and the season to move decisively
towards peace.''
   The conference would be held this month as a way of launching
negotiations on May 1 to provide some self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But Shamir objected that it could provide an active and
meddlesome role for the Soviet Union, who usually back Arab
positions and broke diplomatic relations with Israel 21 years ago.
   On a tour of the troubled West Bank, Shamir again took a stiff
stand Sunday. He said he expected no breakthrough in his talks with
Shultz that begin Monday.
   He again dismissed the conference proposal, saying Shultz should
explain to him why direct talks are not possible without such a
multi-party meeting.
   Israel would deal in the negotiations with a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to work out a three-year interim
arrangement for the occupied areas. Meanwhile, negotiations on the
overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict would begin in
December.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who favors the approach, greeted
Shultz and his wife enthusiastically at the Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv.
   Adressing them as ``George and Helena,'' Peres invited them to
join in this Passover season in prayers for peace.
   ``We shall pray, knowing there is no easy way to peace. The
obstacles are so many and the light so dim,'' Peres said. But he
said, ``it is our duty to provide a green light.''
   Peres said Israel was still looking for Palestinians to agree to
enter the process.
   ``Stones are not messages and messages do not need the threat of
stones,'' he said, referring to the four months of anti-Israeli
protests which have claimed the lives of 136 Palestinians and one
Israeli soldier.

<HEAD>Starling Advocate Takes Flak For Defense Of Maligned Bird</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Spreyer doesn't mind when people say his job
is for the birds. Even his business cards read: ``Mark Spreyer, the
naturalist nobody likes, defending the species nobody wants.
Starlings my speciality.''
   Spreyer never meant to become an advocate for one of the
nation's least-liked birds, but the 31-year-old ornithologist for
the Chicago Academy of Sciences thinks they're getting a bad rap as
messy invaders who take over other birds' turf.
   He recently delivered a lecture titled ``In Defense of
Starlings'' before the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association
in Denver, and he has also spoken on the birds' behalf in New York
and Orlando, Fla.
   He even has one for a pet. Rod Starling shares Spreyer's
suburban Barrington apartment, has learned to talk and has been
known to fly to the telephone when it rings and get the receiver
off the hook.
   Some of Spreyer's enthusiasm has caught on, according to a local
veterinarian, Peregrine Wolff, interviewed by the Chicago Sun-Times
recently after encountering Spreyer's pet.
   ``My opinion of starlings was not very high before I met this
bird,'' said Ms. Wolff, who said Rod imitated Spreyer's telephone
bell and answering-machine beep, and then in a Hitchcockian twist,
said clearly, ``This is Mark Spreyer.''
   Starlings are related to talking myna birds, and Spreyer said
Sunday their talent as mimics helped them wing their way into his
heart. ``I'm embarrassed to admit it now, but eight years ago, I
used to consider them as owl food,'' said Spreyer.
   Spreyer became better acquainted with starlings two years ago
while preparing for a lecture on urban wildlife, which includes
other European imports such as house sparrows and pigeons.
   ``People are trained to think all introduced things are bad and
all native things are good,'' Spreyer said Sunday. ``I've come to
realize that we have to deal with the environment as it is today.''
   Starlings, which often gather in large, noisy flocks, have
gotten an undeservedly bad reputation as mess-makers and nuisances,
while their good points are overlooked, he said.
   The black songbirds use a completely different food source than
other birds, he said.
   While most birds have strong squeezing muscles in their beaks to
enable them to crack nuts, for example, starlings have mighty
muscles for prying things open, adapting them perfectly for digging
up cutworms and other pests.
   Groundskeepers at some golf courses welcome starlings, which
reduce the need for pesticides, Spreyer said.
   ``There are plenty of other birds that make a mess,'' and the
starling's reputation for displacing native birds with aggressive
nesting habits is overblown, he said.
   Some critics remain unconvinced, including Ron Ogden, Illinois
director of animal-damage control for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
   ``They've gotten a bad rap because they're bad birds,'' he told
the Sun-Times. ``I can't believe anybody would be talking up
starlings after all the damage they've caused. ... I know Mark, I
like him, but he doesn't have to deal with them every day like I
do. They give me fits.''
   Ogden said crews have been pruning trees around the old state
Capitol in Springfield to evict non-native starlings whose
droppings made a ``teetotal mess.''

<HEAD>Jackson Invokes Memory Of Martin Luther King Jr.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Jesse Jackson preached Easter
sermons to huge white, black and Hispanic crowds Sunday, invoking
the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. and declaring, ``Hope has been
unleashed.''
   ``There is a sense of hope and renewal in the air,'' Jackson
told a largely Hispanic Catholic congregation where hundreds stood
outside. ``Not an Easter of eggs and rabbits and ruffled dresses,
but an Easter of authentic hope and renewal _ shaking of shackles.''
   Jackson repeatedly referred to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
and compared his death to that of King, the civil rights leader
slain 20 years ago Monday in Memphis.
   ``Dr. King and Jesus ... Government set the climates for their
killings,'' he said. ``... Dr. King got in trouble with our
government for ending apartheid.''
   He compared the crucifixion as well to the suffering of the
poor, and used the symbolism of Easter and the resurrection in
describing the end of President Reagan's administration.
   ``The real Easter is going on,'' Jackson said. ``... We survived
seven years of midnight.''
   Jackson was campaigning a second day in Colorado, where
Democrats express a choice for president in statewide caucuses
Monday night that will apportion 45 delegates.
   As Jackson was met with large, enthusiastic crowds, his campaign
manager, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, said in a TV
interview that the Jackson forces are ready for the closer scrutiny
that comes with a candidate's emergence as a frontrunner.
   ``What Jesse Jackson has done during the course of the last four
or five months ... people have not paid close attention to him,
have not asked him whole lots of questions _ he's been in a
position where he is really prepared his answers. He's prepared
himself to respond to any questions put to him,'' Brown said on the
ABC-TV ``This Week With David Brinkley'' program.
   ``Jackson is smart. He has observed, and he is ready to be
looked at really closely, far more closely than he has been looked
at in the past.''
   Brown also said that ``There is a new Jackson,'' who has shown
`'phenomenal growth'' since his 1984 campaign.
   Jackson on Sunday spoke at Denver's predominantly white First
Baptist Church, where a joint service was held with the
predominantly black Shorter African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Some 1,500 people crowded the church and watched on television from
the basement, and at least as many stood outside in the warm sun,
listening on loudspeakers.
   He then went to Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic church in a
predominantly Hispanic, working class neighborhood. The church was
jammed and hundreds lined up for a block - a half-dozen deep - to
catch a glimpse of the candidate.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena sat with Jackson at the Catholic
church.
   ``Why are so many people here today?'' Jackson asked the
congregation. ``Because hope has been let loose.''
   Jackson was met with similarly large and enthusiastic crowds
Saturday in three other Colorado cities, including the affluent ski
resort Aspen.
   ``I sense, as I travel around the nation, something is going
on,'' he said at First Baptist Church. ``There are several thousand
people outdoors. Something is going on. ... From Aspen to Alabama,
something is going on.''
   Sitting in the front row was Gary Hart, the former Colorado
senator who dropped out of the presidential race, accompanied by
his wife Lee and daughter Andrea.
   Neither Hart nor Pena has endorsed Jackson. Reading one of the
Old Testament lessons at the first church was the state Democratic
Party chairman Buie Seawell, who is backing Michael Dukakis against
Jackson for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Jackson delivered sermons heavy with biblical references, but
blended with it political references to himself and criticism of
President Reagan. The congregations responded with shouts and
applause.
   One of his standard political lines got applause at the Catholic
church.
   ``I would rather have Roosevelt in a wheelchair than Reagan on a
horse,'' he said.

   Rep. Samuel Stratton says he's endorsing
Gov. Mario Cuomo for president, despite Cuomo's insistence that
he's not a candidate.
   ``The only really outstanding candidate that's going to help the
Democratic party is Mario Cuomo and the sooner he recognizes that,
and the Democratic party recognizes that, we're headed for
victory,'' the veteran Albany-area congressman said.
   Stratton said in a weekend radio interview he would back the bid
of former Westchester County congressman Richard Ottinger, who's
urging voters in New York's April 19 Democratic primary to vote for
an uncommitted slate with the hope Cuomo will change his mind.
   He said he knows a ``fantastic number of people in the Albany
area who want to see him as a presidential candidate.''
   ``With his entry into the race we would have a very exciting
finish,'' said Stratton.
   He said he had little hope for the Democratic party if no one
else emerges besides frontrunners Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   ``If that's all it's going to be, we might as well throw the
race,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Delegation Predicts Bush Will Do Better Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin's Republican members of Congress say
Vice President George Bush will fare exceptionally well in
November's general election simply because the Democrats feel he is
the weakest candidate.
   ``He will do better than people expect. He will be stronger and
more tenacious,'' said Rep. Steve Gunderson, who shifted his
support from Sen. Bob Dole, of Kansas, to Bush after Dole dropped
out of the GOP race.
   Rep. Toby Roth, who has not endorsed anyone in Wisconsin's
presidential primary Tuesday, agreed with Gunderson that the
Democrats' perception of Bush will be advantageous.
   ``Remember 1980. All the Democrats were saying they hoped the
Republicans would nominate Ronald Reagan _ he'd be the easiest to
beat,'' Roth said. ``So we nominated Reagan and the Democrats
didn't even come within striking distance.''
   Roth said the continuation of a sound economy, low interest
rates and lack of American involvement in ``shooting war'' would
help Bush win the general election.
   Rep. Thomas Petri said Bush's ability to differentiate himself
from Reagan policy and speak out ``more clearly on domestic issues
so he can use the election as a mandate for policy change'' will be
the key to a Bush victory.
   ``Times have changed and so the emphasis and the issues must
change. He must differentiate himself from Reagan,'' said Petri,
who endorsed Bush's candidacy nearly a year ago.

   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo prayed
Sunday during the Easter Mass for a definitive truce in the
6{-year-old civil war and a ``passage from war to life.''
   The Roman Catholic prelate also announced, after speaking with
representatives of the government and rebels, that peace talks
scheduled to open Wednesday in Managua had been postponed until
April 12.
   A 60-day cease-fire signed March 23 went into effect Friday and
the Defense Ministry said Sunday there were no reports of
violations.
   The rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance alliance on Saturday insisted
the meeting set for Wednesday be postponed for a week, saying
technical talks to work out the mechanics for the cease-fire had
net been resolved.
   Obando y Bravo, who is an observer at the peace negotiations,
told the nearly 300 people who attended Mass at the small Las
Sierritas Church that the one-week delay of the talks is ``sad for
our people.''
   He told the worshipers the new round of peace talks had been
delayed because the rebels, known as Contras, said the Sandinista
government had not complied with the plan signed by both sides at
meetings last month in the border outpost of Sapoa.
   But the cardinal said he is satisfied with the progress in the
negotiations and ``I have a lot of hope on this Easter Sunday.''
   ``Enough of death, a step toward life,'' he said as members of
the congregation applauded and cheered.
   Military officers from the government and Nicaraguan Resistance
met March 28-29 in Sapoa and agreed to set up five zones in which
the Contra combatants would gather as part of the truce.
   They did not, however, establish in detail the zones or security
measure for the rebels.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said Saturday night in a telephone
interview from Miami: ``We are living up to the accord. However the
reason we asked for a delay in the talks is that the zones have yet
to be established and there are many details.''
   The rebels also said the Sandinistas had not freed all the
prisoners requested by the Contras when the government released 100
political prisoners March 29. The cease-fire plan calls for the
gradual release of 3,300 political prisoners.
   In another complaint, the Contras said the government had
violated the provision of the plan that provides for unrestricted
freedom of expression by withholding newsprint to the opposition
newspaper La Prensa. Newsprint, like other imported items, is in
short supply.
   La Prensa, in its March 26 edition, said it would not publish
during Holy Week.
   Pro-government newspapers also haven't published papers since
Wednesday because of the holidays.
   Horacio Ruiz, a La Prensa editor, said Sunday the paper would
publish Monday with stockpiled paper.
   Government offices and most businesses and restaurants have been
closed since Wednesday afternoon.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, in a Friday-dated
letter to Contra leader Aristides Sanchez, said it was ``extremely
important to follow the outline of the cease-fire plan,'' referring
to the talks that had been scheduled for Wednesday.
   Tinoco blamed the Contras for the lack of progress during the
technical meetings, saying the rebel delegation arrived late on the
first day and insisted on ending the talks promptly at 5 p.m. on
the second day.
   The two sides planned to hold another round of technical
negotiations starting Tuesday at Sapoa, 90 miles south of the
capital on the border with Costa Rica.
   Under the truce plan, Contra combatants are to move into
designated zones during the first two weeks of April. There would
be a second release of political prisoners after it was verified
the rebels were in the zones.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Chooses Next Mayor After Maier's Long Reign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Tuesday will choose a fresh face to
occupy the mayor's office in a closely contested race that marks
the end of incumbent Mayor Henry Maier's reign of nearly three
decades.
   Maier has held his office since 1960, longer than any other
big-city mayor in the country. The 70-year-old Maier cited his age
as reason for not running for another term.
   The two contenders vying for his job are state Sen. John
Norquist, 38, and former acting Gov. Martin Schreiber, 48. The race
is non-partisan; both contenders have run for other offices in the
past as Democrats.
   When the campaign began, polls put Norquist well behind. But his
support grew, and he finished 4 percentage points behind Schreiber
in the February primary. Recent polls put the race a dead heat.
   During Maier's tenure, the city enjoyed a downtown renaissance
but suffered from lingering racial divisions, and his performance
received mixed reviews from the two candidates.
   ``The good thing about him is that he's strong and he makes
decisions and deep down inside he cares deeply about the city,''
Norquist said. ``(But) he had trouble dealing with his enemies,
dealing with his critics. I think Henry would take criticism too
much as a personal criticism.''
   Schreiber, meanwhile, said Maier ``has established an excellent
foundation on which we can build.''
   Both candidates praised the downtown revitalization, but they
noted more attention should go toward the inner-city neighborhoods,
which hold the potentially key black vote. About one-fourth of the
city's 600,000 residents are black.
   Schreiber won the endorsement of a black convention organized by
the third-place finisher in the mayoral primary, Lee Holloway.
Norquist boycotted the event, objecting to a $20 admission fee
charged by Holloway to help retire his campaign debt.
   But Norquist may be able to draw on support from key members of
the black community, including Alderman Michael McGee and state
Sen. Gary George.
   ``The biggest single economic problem that we have is the high
black unemployment rate,'' Norquist said. The federal Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported in 1985 that black unemployment in the
Milwaukee metropolitan area was about 28 percent.
   The race between Schreiber and Norquist has centered as much on
their personalities as it has on the issues, where the two
candidates often sound similar.
   Schreiber cultivated an image of being a likable candidate who,
as mayor, would bring together different factions to address the
city's problems and promote harmony.
   But he is criticized for trying to please too many people and
making promises on issues without having all the facts.
   For example, Schreiber won the endorsement of the primary's
fourth-place finisher, Donna Horowitz Richards, when he announced
support of her proposed development programs for neighborhoods.
   But he then was unable to answer certain questions about the
plan, and afterward he backed off his position, saying he would
promise to study the ideas.
   ``I am not a hotshot and I don't have all the answers,''
Schreiber said. ``All of my strengths and all of my successes have
been brought about by getting people around the table and talking
about an issue and then developing a plan.''
   Norquist portrayed himself as a take-charge candidate who offers
detailed programs. But he has been criticized for being too
strident, which Schreiber insists proves his opponent's
``instability.''
   While Norquist says he has tried to tone down emotions, he adds:
``A mayor ought to be able to get angry, especially when it's
something that affects the city.''
   Schreiber was elected lieutenant governor 1970 after eight years
in the state Senate. He became acting governor in 1977 when Gov.
Patrick Lucey resigned to become ambassador to Mexico. But the
following year, Schreiber lost the general election for a full term
as governor to his Republican challenger.
   Norquist, at 6-foot-7 nearly a foot taller than Schreiber,
served in the state Assembly from 1974 to 1982, when he was elected
to the Senate.

   Iraqi troops killed 400 Kurdish civilians
who had been injured in a chemical-bomb attack and were trying to
reach a hospital, a Kurdish guerrilla leader said Sunday.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Neither Iraq
nor Iran, which backs the Iraqi Kurdish separatists, had immediate
comment.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said its warplanes raided two Iranian
refineries Sunday but Iran said the bombs hit residential areas,
killing 10 civilians and wounding 50.
   In Tehran, a senior official told reporters Iran would respond
to the renewed attacks on his nation's cities with ground
offensives.
   Kurdish guerrilla leader Jalal Talabani said the 400 civilians
from the mountainous Qara Dagh district were wounded in an Iraqi
chemical raid.
   Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the
wounded were traveling to a hospital in the northeastern city of
Sulaymaniyah when they were taken prisoner by Iraqi soldiers and
killed on Saturday.
   Talabani is in London and made the accusation in a telephoned
statement.
   Kurdish separatists have been fighting the Iraqi government for
decades for an independent homeland.
   Qara Dagh is 20 miles west of Lake Darbandikhan, where Iran
claims Iraqi chemical bombings March 16-17 killed 5,000 civilians
and injured many more. A senior Iraqi official on Sunday repeated
the claim that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is
biased toward Iran.
   Akram al-Witri, chief of the legal department at the Foreign
Ministry, told a news conference, ``We have been patient but now we
are fed up with Perez de Cuellar and other top U.N. officials who
are appeasing Iran for their self interest.''
   Last week Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz expressed
``bitterness and disappointment at the biased and ill-balanced
nature'' of recent statements by Perez de Cuellar on the alleged
use of chemical weapons by Iraq.
   Al-Witri accused Perez de Cuellar of neglecting the fate of
Iraqi prisoners of war. ``Our 45,000 POWs in Iran are subject to
all kinds of physical and psychological torture and other methods
of maltreatment and it is time'' that the United Nations and
International Red Cross investigate, he said.
   It was the first time Iraq has said Iran is holding 45,000 war
prisoners.
   Also Sunday, an Iranian military spokesman for the first time
listed an overall casualty toll in just over a month of Iraqi air
and missile attacks on Iranian cities _ 1,145 dead and 4,000
wounded. Iraq has said hundreds of its civilians have been killed
in similar raids.
   The latest attacks, which were among 140 warplane combat
missions reported by the Iraqi News Agency during the day, signaled
a rekindling of the ``war of the cities'' after a 2{-day break.
   Iraq anounced its forces sank six Iranian gunboats during the
night as they attempted to approach an offshore oil platform in the
northern Persian Gulf. Iran denied the claim.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as
saying the strikes on Iran's refineries near the cities of Isfahan
and Tabriz were carried out at 2:40 p.m.
   That was about six hours after Turkish Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal left the Iraqi capital. Baghdad had ceased its attacks on
Iranian cities during Ozal's visit and had announced it would not
resume attacks for six hours after Ozal left.
   In Tehran, Kamal Kharrazi, head of the War Information
Headquarters, told reporters that 10 people were killed in Tabriz.
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said another 50
were wounded.
   The Iranian agency said anti-aircraft batteries shot down one of
the warplanes at Isfahan ``seconds after the attack'' on the city.
   It said the pilot, Talal Ibrahim, no rank given, was taken
prisoner by Iranian forces. An Iraqi military communique said an
Iraqi plane ``crashed inside enemy territory.''
   Asked whether Iran would retaliate for Sunday's raids, Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani told reporters in
Tehran:
   ``We will have plenty of surprises for them,'' but they would be
mainly on the battlefield through ``punitive offensives.''
   ``These offensives will stop them definitely, and they will pay
a high price,'' he said.
   Turkish sources said Ozal, who arrived in Ankara later Sunday,
had proposed that Iran and Iraq call a cease-fire in the ``war of
the cities,'' which began Feb. 29.
   Ozal said in a departure statement that Turkey is trying to help
the United Nations end the 7{-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   IRNA quoted a spokesman for the War Information Headquarters as
denying Iraq's claims that it trounced Iran and its Kurdish
separatist allies in fighting last week in mountainous northeastern
Iraq.
   Iraq said Saturday that its forces killed thousands of Iranians
and overran Kurdish guerrilla bases, scoring a major victory and
recapturing tracts of Iraqi soil.
   The Iranian spokesman said Iran was ``in full control'' of all
the towns and strategic heights captured during an offensive that
began in mid-March.
   A senior Chinese envoy, meanwhile, arrived in Saudi Arabia
carrying a message from President Li Xiannian to King Fahd dealing
with the Iran-Iraq war, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
   It said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qi Huaiyuan handed the
written message to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.
The contents were not disclosed.
   Last month Saudi Arabia confirmed it was buying Chinese
intermediate-range missiles. According to U.S. State Department
officials, the deal involved CSS-2 missiles with a range of 1,850
miles.

   Iraqi troops seized 400 civilians who had
been wounded by chemical weapons and were en route to a hospital,
then massacred them at a military camp, a Kurdish guerrilla leader
said Sunday.
   Jalal Talabani said the civilians from Iraq's Qara Dagh district
were wounded in a recent Iraqi chemical-bomb attack. The
predominantly Kurdish district is in a mountainous border region
that has been the scene of fierce fighting
   Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the
wounded were traveling to a hospital in the northeastern city of
Sulaymaniyah when they were taken prisoner by Iraqi soldiers.
   They were forced to go to to the nearby Tanjero military camp
where they were all killed on Saturday, he said.
   Talabani, who is in London and made the accusation in a
telephoned statement, said he did not know what weapons were used
to kill the prisoners.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Neither Iraq
nor Iran, which backs the Iraqi Kurdish separatists, had an
immediate comment.
   Talabani also said there were no Iranian troops in the Qara Dagh
region, and it was controlled by Kurdish separatists.
   Qara Dagh is about 20 miles west of Lake Darbandikhan, where
Iranian Revolutionary Guards have seized Iraqi territory in an
offensive that began in mid-March.
   Kurdish separatists have repeatedly claimed the Iraqi government
is waging a campaign of genocide against the Kurds.
   Iraq, at war with Iran since September 1980, has come under
international criticism for using chemical weapons in the fighting.
   Iran claims Iraqi chemical bombings March 16-17 in the Lake
Darbandikhan area killed 5,000 civilians and injured many more.
   The United Nations has said it will send a team of experts to
investigate the reported use of chemical weapons, outlawed under a
1925 Geneva agreement.

   A pet pig named Chop Chop has become the animal
kingdom's surfing champion, doing a porcine version of a ``hang
ten'' as he rode through the waves with his owner and garnering a
perfect score.
   A dozen surfers paired up with dogs, geese and even fish in an
aquarium Saturday at the ``Wet Pet'' exhibition at the Rell Sunn
Menehune Surfing Championships. Riding tandem on longboards, human
and pet surfers competed before a crowd of 2,000 at Makaha Beach on
Oahu.
   Professional surfer and lifeguard Brian Keaulana, 26, and
3-month-old Chop Chop came in first with their perfect score.
   ``It was a great ride,'' Keaulana said. ``I slapped the pig in
the behind and it went to the nose.
   ``He did kind of a hang ten, but pigs have cloven hoofs, so I
guess it was more like a hang four,'' Keaulana said. ``He liked it
a lot. He was jumping around and going crazy.''
   The ``Wet Pet'' exhibition is part of the Rell Sunn Menehune, a
surfing competition for children 15 and under.
   Keaulana doubts he and Chop Chop will return to defend their
title in 1989.
   ``He'll probably be 300 pounds next year,'' Keaulana said.
``It'll be tough to get him on the board.''
   Keaulana won a trophy and Chop Chop won a reprieve from becoming
the main course at a luau.
   ``I guess we can't eat him, now that he's famous,'' Keaulana
said.

   An Arab was electrocuted Sunday when Israeli
soldiers forced him to climb a utility poll to remove a Palestinian
flag in the West Bank in one of three deaths in the occupied
territories, the army said.
   It reported another Arab was electrocuted while trying to attach
a Palestinian flag to a power line in Tulkarem, also in the West
Bank. Arab reporters said the man was shot by Israeli soldiers
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, arriving on a new
Mideast peace shuttle, told Israel to act on his plan for
negotiations for Palestinian self-rule.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced a new army policy to go
on the offensive and teach rioting Arabs a lesson.
   Sunday's deaths brought to 136 the number of Arabs who have died
in four months of protests against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N. figures. One Israeli soldier
has been killed.
   The months of rioting cast a pall on Christian celebrations of
Easter.
   About 1,000 worshipers, half of last year's number, attended
services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, marking
the site where Christians believe Jesus rose from the dead after
being crucified.
   Shultz said the Palestinians must be included in peace talks and
negotiations must be based on a 1967 United Nations resolution that
calls on Israel to give up territory in exchange for Arab
recognition.
   ``For everything there is a season ... a time to love and a time
to hate; a time for war and a time for peace,'' he said. ``This is
the time and the season to move decisively towards peace.''
   His remarks appeared aimed primarily at Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who told reporters during a visit to a West Bank settlement
Sunday that Shultz had yet to convince him of the need for an
international peace conference.
   The American peace proposal calls for an international
conference on the Middle East. Under the proposal Israel would give
land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace.
   Shultz's third Middle East shuttle since October began after a
sharp escalation of bloodshed in the past week in which 20 Arabs
were killed and scores more shot by Israeli soldiers.
   Visiting the site in Gaza City where soldiers shot three Arabs
to death on Saturday, Rabin explained a new tactic the army was
using to take the initiative away from the Arab demonstrators.
   ``In the majority of the incidents,'' Rabin said about the
recent bloodshed, ``the confrontations were the result of our
initiative, part of an effort to ensure a calming of the situation
and to suppress the violence.''
   Army spokesmen said soldiers would no longer ignore, as they had
in the past, demonstrations in remote villages or other locations
that did not interfere with traffic or endanger lives.
   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said a 40-year-old Ali Diab Abu
Ali died Sunday of a neck wound suffered during Land Day protests
March 30 in the West Bank village Yatta.
   The army said Khalil Jaber Hamzawy, 18, was electrocuted when
soldiers ordered him to climb a utility pole and remove a flag in
the Askar refugee camp near Nablus.
   The army also said a 20-year-old Arab man was electrocuted while
trying to attach an outlawed Palestinian flag to a power line in
the West Bank town of Tulkarem. Arab journalists said soldiers shot
the youth.
   The United Nations did not include the Tulkarem death in its
toll.
   Sheik Saad Eddin Alami, the 77-year-old mufti, or Moslem leader,
of Jerusalem, said he suffered heart problems after an Israeli
policeman struck him Friday as he sought permission to allow TV
cameramen into the Al Aqsa Mosque area.
   Police spokesman Alex Lapidot described Alami's claims as ``a
big lie from start to end.''
   In a leaflet last week, underground leaders called for a general
strike in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Monday to
protest the Shultz visit. They demanded that Palestinians avoid
meeting Shultz during his visit.
   Speaking to reporters in the Israeli military settlement of
Ginat, Shamir predicted arranging peace talks would be a lengthy
process.
   ``I'm skeptical about all the prophecies that the talks will
have some kind of result, a breakthrough,'' said Shamir, who called
for Shultz to concentrate on the substance of a settlement and not
the logistics of starting negotiations.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union detonated an underground nuclear
blast Sunday in the republic of Kazakhstan, the third such test
announced by the Soviets this year, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   It said the blast had a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons. The U.S.
atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, had a yield
of 20 kilotons, or the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT.
   No details of the test blast were given by Tass other than that
it was ``carried out with a view to upgrading military technology.''
   The device was exploded at 5:35 a.m. Moscow time at the Soviet
Union's main nuclear testing range in Semipalatinsk, in the Central
Asian republic of Kazakhstan, according to Tass.
   In January, an American scientific delegation visited the
Semipalatinsk range to gather information that may be used in
verifying U.S.-Soviet compliance with a future test ban.
   An exchange of visits to Semipalatinsk and to the U.S. nuclear
testing site in Nevada is planned this month.
   The Soviet government has been pressing for a pact prohibiting
nuclear testing, but U.S. and Soviet officials disagree on
verification procedures.

   Police watched over Easter Sunday services in
the city's impoverished south-central neighborhoods, attempting to
reassure churchgoers shocked by a Good Friday street gang shooting
that ranked among the city's worst.
   ``The decent people in the community have a right to see us
around every once in a while,'' said Sgt. Jack Davenport, adding
that his officers were ordered to make their presence known near
churches.
   ``I'm pleased,'' said Osmond Lindo, pastor of Vermont Square
United Methodist Church, when he heard two officers had parked out
front and looked in briefly on his service. ``We need to let the
thugs in our city know they cannot dominate our city.''
   Most people leaving the service said they hadn't noticed the
officers but many in the largely minority neighborhood said the
offical concern about continuing gang violence was long overdue.
   ``This stuff is going on every day,'' said Ron McKnight, 58,
whose son Rodney, 19, was recovering from seven bullet wounds
suffered in the shooting.
   ``Any day is a Good Friday when people can walk the streets, sit
on their porch,'' said McKnight, adding his son, like most of those
wounded, wasn't associated with gangs.
   At St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church near the scene of the
shootings, the Rev. Eli Bauwens welcomed the police interest, but
urged worshipers to seek solace in God. He held up the example of
Jesus' disciples, who spread the message of Christianity despite
fear of death at the hands of unbelievers.
   The police deployment followed an overnight sweep by a task
force of more than 300 officers seeking to intimidate gang members
and forestall retaliation for the Friday night shooting, which
killed one man and injured 12 other people, one of them a
4-year-old boy.
   The killers, who gunned down rival gang members and innocent
bystanders alike from a passing car, remained at large Sunday.
   Police who participated in the overnight sweep arrested 175
people for investigation of a variety of alleged offenses and
interrogated 619 people, about 500 of them believed to be gang
members, said Detective Tony Celli.
   The stepped-up police presence around churches Sunday was
accomplished without extra manpower, though Police Chief Daryl
Gates on Saturday reiterated an oft-repeated promise to declare war
on the gangs, blamed for nearly 400 killings in Los Angeles County
last year.
   Officers were ordered to show the flag around services as much
as possible in the course of their regular duties.
   Gates said Saturday he would redeploy his force to boost the
number of officers on south-central streets from 200 to 1,000. He
didn't say when the redeployment, to be accomplished by putting
officers on overtime, would begin.
   Police said the Good Friday shootings may have been the city's
worst in terms of the number of total casualties. In 1984, five
people were killed and five others injured in a gang shooting at a
party outside a home.
   For residents of the gang-plagued area, ``drive-by'' shootings
such as Friday's are chillingly commonplace.
   ``This is nothing new for any of us,'' said Bauwens at St.
Brigid, who heard the gunshots from his room in the rectory.
   ``Everybody here lives in a certain amount of fear,'' Bauwens
said. ``I must have done half a dozen funerals in the past year or
two for teen-agers, all boys, who are victims of gangs.''
   Most of the wounded were not associated with gangs, but were
standing and talking on a sidewalk in an area claimed as drug-sales
territory by five or six gangs, police said.
   The 4-year-old who was wounded, Dashawn Holly, was reported in
fair condition Sunday at County-USC Medical Center.

   Mormon Church leaders praised Jesus Christ
as the resurrected son of God to close the faith's 158th Annual
General Conference Sunday with an Easter theme reaffirming
fundamental church doctrine.
   The gathering closed with a sermon written by President Ezra
Taft Benson telling listeners to demonstrate their love for God by
obeying his laws.
   ``I pray that we will be obedient to God, learn his will and do
it, and above all, that we will keep the first and great
commandment _ to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and
strength,'' said the sermon, which was read by Gordon B. Hinckley,
a counselor in the church's ruling First Presidency.
   Benson's sermon said Mormons should consider whether they are
adhering to the church's principles, such as participating in
missionary work, daily Scripture reading, and building family unity
with weekly activities.
   It also stressed the longstanding admonition that church members
prepare for possible emergencies by keeping on hand enough food,
clothing and other essential supplies to last one year.
   A church official said the 88-year-old Benson asked Hinckley to
read the sermon for him because he was tired.
   Earlier, Hinckley delivered his own homily saying Christ
submitted to crucifixion to make the resurrection of all men and
women possible through his own death. Mormon doctrine holds that
mankind will be resurrected in perfect, immortal physical bodies
before the final judgment.
   ``Of all the victories of human history, none is so great, none
so universal in its effect, none so everlasting in its
consequences, as the victory of the crucified Lord who came forth
in the resurrection that first Easter morning,'' Hinckley said.
   Joseph B. Wirthlin, a member of the Twelve, a group of clergy
that assist the First Presidency, urged Mormons to follow Christ by
emulating his honesty, which he said includes paying employees a
fair wage, filing accurate tax returns and not padding expense
accounts.
   The leaders spoke as part of a series of 12 sermons capping the
two-day conference, in which speakers stressed the church's basic
beliefs about Christ's resurrection.
   Critics have accused Mormons of exalting Joseph Smith, who
believers say found the church in 1820 after God and Jesus appeared
to him, to a level equal to or surpassing Jesus. But the speakers
gave no indication that their remarks were in response to such
criticism.
   The conference, attended by more than 6,000 church members, also
was told Saturday that the church attracted a record 227,284
converts during 1987, bringing total membership to 6.5 million.

<HEAD>Vietnam Prepares To Return Remains Of Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is scheduled to make its
largest release of what are believed to be remains of U.S. military
personnel missing in action in the Vietnam War that ended with a
communist victory in 1975.
   A U.S. military team is to receive the 27 sets of remains on
Wednesday at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport and fly them to the Army's
Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for analysis.
   It would be the fourth turnover since retired Gen. John W.
Vessey, acting as President Reagan's special emissary, reached an
agreement in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, last August that ended
months of deadlocked negotiatons on the issue.
   Positive identifications of the 27 sets of remains would mean
substantial progress because Hanoi has returned only 152 confirmed
sets since the war.
   The two nations often have quarreled over accounting for the
1,767 Americans who remain listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
   The largest previous transfer of remains was on Aug. 14, 1985.
It involved 26 sets, and at least 24 have been identified as
American remains.
   A U.S. official closely involved in the issue said recently that
while progress since the Vessey agreement had not been as rapid as
Washington had hoped, Hanoi has been much more responsive to U.S.
requests to investigate reports involving MIAs.
   The Vietnamese have been discussing the issue with an increasing
number of congressmen and other American visitors, many of whom
return to urge increased official contacts with Hanoi.
   In March, the Vietnamese met with John LeBoutillier, a former
congressman who now heads a private lobbying group that insists
there are still Americans being held prisoners in Vietnam.
   The MIA issue also is on the agendas of U.S. Sens. Larry
Pressler, R-S.D., and G.V. Sonny Montgomery, D-Mo., who are
separately visiting Hanoi this week.
   The U.S. official said the Vietnamese have indicated they did
not believe Washington was implementing humanitarian provisions of
the Vessey agreement. He said the Vietnamese complained that the
United States has only sent exploratory medical teams and
encouraged private U.S. agencies to aid Vietnam's disabled war
veterans and other humanitarian cases.
   ``They're not making a secret that they prefer direct
government-to-government aid,'' said the official, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations.

   Afghan President Najib on Sunday
declared the first day of general elections a national holiday, the
government's radio station reported.
   The elections, scheduled to begin Tuesday, come at a time when
negotiations are under way in Switzerland on the withdrawal of an
estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel in Afghanistan.
   ``As proposed by the election commission, the 5th of April will
be a national holiday on the occasion of the elections for the
National Assembly,'' Radio Kabul quoted Najib as saying in a decree.
   One-fourth of the 62 Senate and 229 House of Deputies seats are
to be set aside for rebel candidates, even if they do not
participate. The elections are to run until April 14.
   Most members of the election commission organizing the balloting
are from the Marxist government.
   The guerrillas have refused any power-sharing with the
communists and have vowed to fight until they overthrow the
government.
   Radio Kabul's broadcast of Najib's statement was monitored in
Islamabad.
   Leftists in the armed foreces seized power in a coup in April
1978. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to help the
faltering government battle the guerrillas.
   The United States, Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan have
been involved for months in U.N.-sponsored efforts to bring about a
withdrawal of the Soviet troops and a peaceful settlement in the
war.
   Talks in Geneva recessed for the Easter holiday and are to
resume Monday.

<HEAD>Company Under Fire From Government, Ex-Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company that advertised that it could help
businesses secure loans is facing an FBI investigation and lawsuits
from unhappy ex-clients who paid high fees but never received
financing, according to a report published Sunday.
   The Boston Sunday Globe reported that since its founding in
1986, First Boston Charter Corp. has collected between $2 million
and $50 million from clients seeking loans. But dozens of clients
interviewed by the newspaper reported that they didn't get any
loans and were unable to recover their fees.
   Three ex-clients have sued FBC in U.S. District Court in Boston,
and a federal grand jury in Las Vegas has indicted the executives
of several companies with which FBC works. An FBI spokesman said
the agency has launched an investigation of First Boston Charter
and several of the companies it deals with.
   The company is unrelated to the New York-based securities firm,
First Boston Corp.
   FBC President Marc W. Anderson refused to be interviewed, the
Globe said. His associate, Paul J. Gilbert, also refused comment
and referred questions to William M. Codinha, the Boston lawyer
representing the company.
   Codinha told the Globe that after consulting his clients, he
decided it was ``not in their interest'' to talk.
   According to the Globe, FBC works with numerous other companies
in arranging loans and loan guarantees. The various companies
involved claim to be independent of each other, the Globe said, but
in fact are linked in some way.
   George H. Jones Jr., 56, of Allentown, Pa., told the Globe he
went to FBC when he and a partner were looking for a $500,000 loan
to set up a charter bus company and saw a newspaper advertisement
for FBC.
   He told the Globe that FBC officials told him that FBC did not
make loans, but would get him a loan guarantee _ a promise that
money he borrowed would be repaid even if the bus company failed.
FBC also told him that a second company would issue the guarantee.
   Jones said that while the second company did not make the actual
loan, it would direct him to a third company that would come up
with the money.
   Jones told the newspaper that FBC executives warned him that
there would be risks in the deal.
   However, Jones said, by the beginning of 1987, he had paid FBC a
$20,000 fee, a $3,500 fee to a company called First Fidelity
Finance for a ``character and credit investigation'' and was making
$1,000 monthly fee payments to another company in on the deal,
Euro-Shares, based in Spain.
   Last August, Jones said, he lost his bus company and he
eventually had to sell his car and put his house on the market
because of indebtedness.
   Edward Showalter, an Ohio manufacturer who sought a $1 million
loan through a series of companies that involved FBC's Anderson to
produce a line of clothing featuring cartoon characters, told the
newspaper a story similar to Jones'. Showalter paid several
companies fees totaling $42,500 but never received the $1 million
loan he was seeking, according to the Globe.
   In a suit filed here, businessman Richard P. Johnson of Stuart,
Fla., contends he and a client of his paid fees totaling $70,000 to
FBC for help in securing $35 million in loans, but never received
any financing.
   One of several European companies to which FBC clients are
referred, Euro-Kredit, N.A., is owned by Alan Copeland, who is
under indictment in Las Vegas for fraud. Copeland's real name is
Bruce Cooper and he is a convicted bank robber and con man, the
newspaper reported.
   Five other people were also indicted last fall _ two Copeland
colleagues and three executives of other companies affiliated with
First Boston, the newspaper said. The various companies are accused
of working together to defraud clients, splitting the large fees
but failing to provide loans.
   The newspaper said First Boston Charter claimed to have growing
numbers of satisified customers, but declined to name any of them.
   According to the Globe, records in Ohio and California show that
Anderson changed his name shortly before arriving in Boston to set
up First Boston Charter in mid-1986. Before the change, his name
was William Marc Knasel, the Globe said.

   At least three people were wounded
Sunday in a shooting at a funeral at a church, hospital officials
said.
   Details of the shooting at Mountain Home Baptist Church were
sketchy and the number of victims was not immediately known. The
shooting occurred shortly before 3 p.m., when the funeral of Effie
Collins Justice was scheduled.
   Andrea Rainey, 40, was taken to Margaret Pardee Hospital in
Hendersonville where she began undergoing surgery at 5:30 p.m. for
a bullet wound, officials said.
   Wendy Johnston, 11, was in good condition and was being
transported to Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, along with
her mother, Shelia Johnston, 30. Mrs. Johnston was in critical
condition and the extent of her injuries was not known.

   A 3-year-old boy visiting his grandfather's
grave with his parents was fatally crushed when a tombstone fell on
him, police said.
   Christopher Rigsby was pronounced dead on arrival at Union
Memorial Hospital on Saturday after suffering severe head injuries,
a police spokesman said.
   Relatives were hammering a small wooden cross into the
grandfather's grave as an Easter decoration Saturday morning when
the headstone of an adjacent grave fell forward on top of
Christopher, crushing him, police said.
   Joseph R. Swift, the cemetery manager, said he called police
after he was informed of the incident and then walked out of his
office to see Julia Rigsby, 26, sitting in the back of a car
holding her unconscious son in her lap.
   ``She wouldn't let anyone near the boy until an ambulance
came,'' Swift said.
   The granite headstone, which was about 3 feet tall by 2 feet
wide, fell away from its foot-high base, Swift said. The marker had
been attached to the base with an epoxy seal.
   The boy's grandmother, Roberta Malantrucolo, told police she had
stopped the boy from climbing on some tombstones earlier, Swift
said.

<HEAD>Shipbuilders Reject New BIW Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shipbuilders' union at the Bath Iron
Works has rejected a proposed three-year contract that both the
company and union had hoped would usher in a new era of labor peace.
   However, Saturday's vote did not signal authorization for a
strike. The 5,500-member union and the company are expected to
stick with the existing contract that expires Aug. 14 and re-enter
negotiations sometime this summer.
   BIW had invited its unions to open contract talks early, in
hopes of improving its competitiveness. It lost four of five Navy
cruiser contracts in February to rival Ingalls Shipbuilding of
Mississippi.
   The proposed contract, which offered three annual 2.5 percent
wage increases and the phase-out of a two-tier pay system that
gives less to new employees, was rejected by a margin of roughly 3
to 2, said Ray Ladd, president of Local 6 of the Industrial Union
of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America.
   About 2,500 of the union's approximately 5,500 members
participated in the voting.
   ``I feel it should have gone through, because I don't feel
they're going to offer any more in August,'' Ladd said.
   Duane D. Fitzgerald, BIW's executive vice president, issued a
statement saying management officials were ``disappointed with the
result but believe the process was constructive and informative.''
   ``We do not regret having made the effort,'' Fitzgerald said.
   Ladd blamed the rejection in part on members' desire for bigger
pay hikes and a swifter end to the two-tier wage system. He said he
understood rank-and-file sentiments but added, ``the company hasn't
got any money. They opened the books and proved it.''
   Under the current contract, newer employees have been paid about
$3 less an hour than veteran workers. The rejected company proposal
would have phased out the two-tier system in April 1990.
   The proposed 2.5 percent wage increase would have amounted to 29
cents an hour more for first-class mechanics in the first two years
of the contract and 30 cents an hour more the final year.
   Members of Local 7, a much smaller union representing 393
clerical and technical workers, overwhelmingly approved a new
three-year contract a week ago.
   The shipyard, Maine's largest private employer, reached its
highest peacetime employment level last month, reporting 8,900
workers on its payroll.

<TEXT>
   Police and troops moved to tighten
security along India's frontier with Pakistan Sunday and three more
deaths were blamed on Sikh extremists in northern Punjab state that
borders Pakistan.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Friday ordered increased border
security to try to stem the delivery of weapons to the Sikh
separatists in Punjab. India contends Sikh militants are receiving
arms smuggled from Pakistan.
   Sikh extremists killed at least 120 people in the week ending
Saturday, the highest one-week toll since separatists began a
guerrilla war for their own homeland in 1982. Many of the victims
were Hindus, but moderate Sikhs also have been slain by the
militants.
   Patrols were stepped up along the Indo-Pakistan border in
northern Kashmir state, United News of India reported. Punjab is
south of Kashmir and east of Pakistan.
   Police and paramilitary unit commanders are scheduled to meet
Monday in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar to discuss increased
security in Punjab.
   Several Indian newspapers reported Sunday that the government
was considering the construction of fences along parts of the
Indo-Pakistan border as well as increased patrols.
   United News of India said two people, who it did not identify,
were shot to death in Gurdaspur district in separate attacks late
Saturday and Sunday. A village leader was killed in Amritsar
district Saturday night, the news agency said. He was identified as
Nirmal Singh, a Sikh.
   The latest killings raised to at least 648 the number of deaths
blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab this year. In 1987, about 1,000
people were slain in violence related to the separatists' campaign.
   Punjab Gov. S.S. Ray on Sunday visited three villages where 28
people were shot to death by Sikh militants last week. He pledged
government assistance to the survivors.
   Eighteen of the victims were Hindus living in a hamlet near the
village of Pangota, 24 miles north of Amritsar.
   Sikhs, whose religion is an offshoot of Hinduism and Islam, make
up only 2 percent of India's 800 million population, but they are a
majority in Punjab.

<HEAD>Five Months After Well Rescue, Celebrity Status Has Ups and Downs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than five months after Jessica
McClure's dramatic rescue from a narrow well gripped the nation,
the child and her family continue to grapple with the ups and downs
of their celebrity status.
   The Texas Rangers expect their opening-day game Monday to be
packed as Jessica tosses out the first ball of the season at
Arlington Stadium.
   That was hardly the McClures' only offer.
   ``Later, I got a call from the Houston Astros,'' said former
state Sen. Pete Snelson of Midland, the family's publicist. He said
he turned down the Astros' request for Jessica because the family
didn't have time for their Tuesday opener.
   Last week, Jessica and her mother, Reba ``Cissy'' McClure,
traveled to Lancaster in North Central Texas to help fund-raising
efforts for a 5-year-old boy who faces heart and lung transplants.
   But not all the attention leveled at the family has been
flattering.
   The McClures bought a new three-bedroom tract house in the
modest suburb of Greenwood. Mrs. McClure, who turned 19 last week,
stays home with Jessica while her 18-year-old husband works at a
new job selling sporting goods at a local store.
   But when Oprah Winfrey brought her television talk show to
Midland and sent a limousine to pick up the McClures, rumors spread
that the couple was living in a large home in an exclusive
neighborhood.
   ``That's when the rumors started flying,'' said M.L. Blevins,
accountant for the McClures. He dismissed the talk, estimating the
value of the McClures' new home at between $30,000 and $40,000.
   Snelson said the McClures' lifestyle has remained relatively
Spartan, despite large sums of money placed into a trust fund and
forwarded in other donations.
   But the family's fame remains strong and the notoriety hasn't
been all bad for a town that had been hit hard by the slump in oil
and gas prices.
   ``I got a letter the other day _ a registered letter _ addressed
to `Jessica's mayor,''' said Carroll Thomas, Midland mayor.
   Thomas recently formed a committee to choose the best movie deal
about the well rescue and break an impasse between two associations
of rescuers pursuing separate agreements.
   Initially, he said, the rescue ``did a lot to take our minds off
the oil business problems. It gave us a chance to think about the
fact that there are things just as important (as), if not more
important than, money.''

   The presidential candidates took their politicking to Easter
church services on Sunday as they battled for victory in this
week's campaign double feature _ the Colorado caucuses and
Wisconsin primary.
   Republican Pat Robertson, whose candidacy is all but derailed by
Vice President George Bush's march to the nomination, said he has a
mandate from God and won't stop until he is president of the United
States.
   Saying he would run again in 1992, Robertson told about 3,000
people at Denver's Happy Church that ``I am not going to quit ...
That is His plan for me and for this nation.''
   But with Bush's nomination virtually assured, the 1988 focus is
now on the Democrats.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who has staked hopes of
reviving his trailing campaign with a good showing in Wisconsin on
Tuesday, picked up the endorsement this weekend of the Milwaukee
Journal.
   The newspaper cited Gore's ``impressive record'' in arms
control, military reform and environmental protection, cand called
him ``one of Congress' best informed members on the future of
science and technology.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who shares frontrunner
status with Jesse Jackson, was asked by reporters outside a
Milwaukee church if he shared the view of some Democrats that
Jackson is not electable because he his black and too liberal.
   ``I don't think there is any way of knowing,'' Dukakis said.
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk also sidestepped that
question Sunday when interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program.
   ``We haven't nominated anyone yet,'' he said. ``The Democratic
Party will do its best to nominate, I hope, the most electable
candidate in order to win in November.''
   Jackson on Sunday showed no concern about reports of
consternation among Democrats over his recent momentum.
   Speaking to overflow crowds at two Denver churches, he continued
to hammer home the themes that have brought a burgeoning response
to his campaign.
   At the First Baptist Church, where 1,500 people jammed inside
and at least as many listened to him on loudspeakers outside,
Jackson said:
   ``I sense as I travel around the nation something is going on.
There are several thousand people outdoors _ something is going on.
   ``From Aspen to Alabama _ something is going on ... Hope has
been unleased.''
   Later, in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, people lined
the street for a block to see Jackson arrive at Our Lady of
Guadalupe Catholic church.
   Jackson's success in the primaries and caucuses _ including a
victory over Dukakis in the Virgin Islands on Saturday _ has
created a sticky issue for Democrats bent on picking a nominee who
can secure the White House.
   His campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown
said Sunday that the margin of Jackson's successes has surprised
even him. But he said that even if Jackson gets the most delegates
by the end of the primary season, that doesn't mean he should get
the nomination.
   ``You can have a plurality of the delegates and still not be
able to reach the 2,082 required to secure the nomination,'' Brown
said on ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``I only believe he's entitled to the nomination if we succeed
in producing the appropriate number of delgates that George
McGovern got, that Fritz Mondale got, or that Jimmy Carter got,''
Brown said.
   But Brown also raised the possibility of the Jackson forces
instigating a rules fight at the convention this summer if the
delegate race does not play out as they think it fairly should.
   Jackson himself downplayed the possibility it would come to that.
   ``We're certainly going to stand for fairness, but I hope it
won't come to a fight. I think that most Demcrats are going to
stand for that which is fair and that which is right,'' he said as
he campaigned in Colorado.
   It appears unlikely any Democrat will have enough delegates in
hand to secure the nomination at the end of the primary season in
June. The nomination thus will lie in the hands of the so-called
super delegates, who are automatically delegates by virtue of their
position as party leaders or elected officials.
   Dukakis so far has won 653.5 delegates to Jackson's 646.5 and
Gore's 381.8, according to The Associated Press tally.
   Democratic leader Kirk on Sunday appeared to moderate his
suggestion that his party should rally behind whoever is the
frontrunner at the end of the primary season.
   Kirk said that a candidate who emerges with the most delegates,
but shy of the needed 2,082, should not automatically get the
party's nod.
   ``That's not what the rules say. The rules say that the person
who attains a majority of delegates will be the party's nominee,''
he said.
   He said that when he earlier had talked about getting party
leaders together to solidify support for a frontrunner, he meant
that if anyone gained ``a very very substantial plurality of
delegates and someone has the nomination within virtually within
his grasp, that the party ought to sit down'' and talk about
getting behind that person.
   Under questioning, he refused to say what would consistute a
substantial plurality.
   Spokeswoman Julie Anbender later said Kirk's views on the matter
have not changed.
   ``Kirk has not altered his position about rallying behind the
clear-cut frontrunner. He continues to believe that at the end of
the process, one of our candidates will clearly emerge from the
pack and Kirk will at that point encourage the party to rally
behind its inevitable nominee,'' she said.
   Brown noted that the Jackson campaign is actively seeking out
support among the superdelegates and the uncommitted delegates,
particularly members of Congress who represent districts where
Jackson has run strongly.
   As if the Jackson forces would, as they did at the 1984
convention, challenge any rules on how delegates are selected
should Jackson fail to bring many uncommitted delegates on board,
Brown said.
   ``I think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so.''
   Jackson previously has said he has no plans to raise rules
challenges at the summer convention in Atlanta. But he has also
said he expects the party to treat him fairly.

   A Panamanian military vehicle on
Sunday tried to stop the car of U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, the
U.S. Embassy reported and it called the ``serious.''
   Terence Kneebone, an embassy spokesman, said Davis was leaving
the residence of the Vatican's ambassador in a chauffeur-driven car
when a military ``vehicle began following immediately, picking them
up right outside the gate.
   ``It followed them down Balboa Avenue, then tried to stop them
with lights and sirens. The ambassador's driver, in accordance with
instructions, did not stop. The ambassador was driven to his
residence, and the other vehicle followed all the way.''
   ``We consider this serious,'' Kneebone added. He said that would
be the embassy's only characterization of the incident and referred
further questions to the State Department in Washington.
   Kneebone said Davis had gone to call on the papal nuncio,
Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa, to pay his respects on Easter
Sunday. The spokesman noted that the papal ambassador is the dean
of the diplomatic corps in Panama.
   The distance between Laboa's residence and the American
ambassador's house is about two miles, and the route followed by
Davis' car took him along oceanfront Balboa Avenue.
   Sunday's edition of the daily newspaper La Republica, which is
run by the military, carried a front-page picture of Davis with a
caption that said he did not venture from his residence unless he
was ``armed to the teeth.''
   The brief article accused the ambassador of ``exaggerating'' any
possible threat to his personal security and said Davis suffered
from either ``a persecution complex'' or ``guilty conscience.''
   The incident came only three days after the Panamanian
government said the Defense Forces, commanded by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, would not do anything to provoke an excuse for a
U.S. invasion. The United States has demanded that Noriega, under
federal indictment in Florida on drug-trafficking charges, resign.
   In its statement the government said, ``Aware of the
overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic of Panama ... will
not provide the foundation for fabrication of a charge of
aggression that could pretent to justify the launching of acts of
war.''

<TEXT>
   The last act of Gov. Evan Mecham's
impeachment trial begins Monday with attorneys' final arguments,
wrapping up a historical drama involving charges of obstruction of
justice and misuse of state funds.
   If the Arizona Senate votes against him, Mecham would become the
seventh U.S. governor removed from office by impeachment. The vote
could come as early as Monday.
   It would take a two-thirds vote or 20 of the senators to convict
Mecham, who has only been in office a little more than a year. The
body then could take a second vote and bar him from holding state
office again.
   If he is acquitted, Mecham would still face a recall election
May 17. He also faces a criminal trial on felony charges associated
with alleged concealment of a $350,000 campaign loan. That charge
was included in the articles of impeachment but was thrown out by
senators last week in a surprise vote.
   The first impeachment charge alleges that Mecham, 63, obstructed
justice by impeding an attorney general's investigation of an
alleged death threat on a grand jury witness by one of Mecham's
staff members. The witness, a former Mecham aide, had agreed to
testify about Mecham's campaign finances.
   In the second charge, he is accused of illegally lending public
funds _ $80,000 from a protocol fund _ to his auto dealership.
   An underlying question is whether either of the charges, if
sustained, constitutes ``high crimes, malfeasance and
misdeameanors,'' the requirement for removing an elected official.
   The prosecution, in a trial memorandum, urged senators to
convict Mecham.
   ``The criminal acts and the acts of abuse of power, breach of
public trust, neglect of duty and obstruction of justice demand
that Gov. Mecham be removed from office,'' they said.
   Defense lawyers said they would respond with written arguments
Monday. But after five weeks of testimony, the respective positions
are clear.
   Prosecutors say the first-term Republican governor instructed
the state's top lawman, Ralph Milstead, not to cooperate with an
attorney general's investigation of the alleged death threat.
   Mecham, who says he was politically ``at war'' with the attorney
general, concedes he may have said something like that but insists
he acted out of ignorance of the facts. Mecham claims no one told
him details of the alleged threat.
   A key issue is the credibility of several witnesses, the key
ones being Mecham and Milstead.
   The second charge involves money. Mecham says money raised by
his inaugural committee to pay off his campaign debts always
remained private money even after a law prevented its use for its
original purpose. The prosecution says it became public money when
it was placed in a protocol fund to pay for gifts to visiting
dignitaries and events enhancing the image of Arizona.
   Undisputed is the fact that Mecham loaned $80,000 from the fund
to his car dealership, did not record the deed of trust and paid it
back three months later with interest when another campaign finance
scandal erupted over the $350,000 loan.
   Prosecutors will say that Mecham's loan was unethical and
illegal. Defense lawyers will say it was legal and for the good of
the state. Mecham has contended his only motive was to increase the
fund by paying higher interest than it was getting at a bank,
disputing the prosecution's contention that the dealership was in
financial difficulty and needed the money.
   Arguments were expected to take about two hours, with each side
speaking a half hour on each charge.
   The procedure of the senators voting on each charge separately
could be lengthy, whether it starts Monday or Tuesday. Unlike
jurors in a court trial, the 30 senators each get 15 minutes to
explain their votes.

   A Panamanian military vehicle tried
to stop the chauffeur-driven limousine of U.S. Ambassador Arthur
Davis on Sunday but the diplomat continued on to his residence, the
U.S. Embassy reported.
   It called the incident ``serious.''
   The effort to stop the ambassador came after Panamanians rich
and poor attended church services observing a somber Easter in the
crisis over the refusal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to resign.
   Noriega commands the 15,000-member Defense Forces and as the
military strongman is the power behind the civilian government. He
is under indictment by a federal grand jury in Florida, and has
rejected U.S. demands that he resign.
   Terence Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Davis had
visited the Vatican ambassador and was leaving in his car when a
military ``vehicle began following immediately, picking them up
right outside the gate.
   ``It followed them down Balboa Avenue, then tried to stop them
with lights and sirens. The ambassador's driver, in accordance with
instructions, did not stop. The ambassador was driven to his
residence, and the other vehicle followed all the way.''
   ``We consider this serious,'' Kneebone added. He said that would
be the embassy's only characterization of the incident and referred
any further questions to the State Department in Washington.
   Kneebone said Davis had gone to call on the papal nuncio,
Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa, to pay his respects on Easter
Sunday. The spokesman noted that the papal ambassador is the dean
of the diplomatic corps in Panama.
   The distance between Laboa's residence and the American
ambassador's home is about two miles.
   Sunday's edition of the military-run newspaper La Republica
carried a front-page picture of Davis with a caption that said he
did not venture from his residence unless he was ``armed to the
teeth.''
   A brief article accused the ambassador of ``exaggerating'' any
possible threat to his personal security and said he suffered from
either ``a persecution complex'' or ``guilty conscience.''
   The incident came only three days after the Panamanian
government said the Defense Forces would not do anything to provoke
an excuse for a U.S. invasion.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war,'' the government said.
   The United States has more than 10,000 military personnel in
Panama under the Panamanian-based U.S. Southern Command. The Reagan
administration said Friday it would sent 1,300 additional soldiers
and Marines to Panama this week to reinforce security for Americans
and U.S.facilities in the country.
   In a televised Mass, Monsignor Marcos A. McGrath, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Panama City, said, ``This Sunday of the
resurrection of 1988 is particularly dramatic for us.''
   ``During this Lenten season, we have suffered strong divisions,
tensions among the Panamanian people,'' he said. ``We have suffered
many privations.
   ``In these final days of Holy Week, half of Panama has been
fasting because it has no food, and the other half has been fasting
in sympathy with them.''
   The country's economy has foundered since March 4 when Noriega
closed banks to prevent a run on cash made scarce by U.S.
sanctions. The economic chaos was aggravated by a two-week-old
general strike that closed down an estimated 90 percent of the
country's business and industry.
   Protesters have taken to the streets, and Noriega's troops have
responded with force.
   The strike eased late last week, with some groceries and
pharmacies opening, reportedly under government pressure.
Opposition leaders have not formally called off the strike and were
to meet Sunday and Monday to discuss whether to continue it.
   At a Mass at Cristo Rey Church, the Rev. Xavier Villanueva, an
outspoken Noriega foe, urged Catholics to support a recent call by
Panama's nine bishops for the general's resignation.
   The congregation broke into applause and many waved white
handkerchiefs, which have become a symbol of dissent in Panama's
crisis.
   In his Easter homily, McGrath spoke of the nation's ``social
decomposition.'' He referred to ``the reality of disintegrating
homes, the reality of a people increasingly losing confidence in
their leaders, the reality of a community misinformed by the
partisanizing and falsifying of the news.''
   The crisis, which had been building for months, erupted in late
February when then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire
Noriega, who had been indicted in the United States on
drug-trafficking charges. Delvalle's move backfired when Noriega
dismissed him.

   The quest for votes in Tuesday's Wisconsin
primary took Democratic presidential candidate Paul Simon to the
bunny trail at a local park Sunday.
   The Illinois senator was surrounded by young and old as he
appeared at Wingra Park during the traditional Easter egg hunt. One
little boy presented Simon with a colored egg.
   Simon, shown in the latest polls to be trailing far behind
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson in the
Wisconsin race, urged the youngsters to tell their parents to vote,
and told voting-age onlookers to be sure to cast ballots on Tuesday.
   He said his experience and his proposals for helping the poor
and providing long-term health care separate him from other
Democratic candidates.
   ``I share (Jackson's) passion for the less fortunate,'' Simon
said. ``I offer not only passion, but the experience to do
something about it.''
   As for Dukakis, Simon said, ``We need something more than a good
manager...I have the experience with national issues that, frankly,
Mike doesn't have.''
   Simon said the nation has suffered because of the lack of
experience on the part of another former governor: President Reagan.
   ``The people ought to ask the basic question, `Who would make
the best president?' and vote on it,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developed Sunday in the Midwest and lower Ohio
Valley, spawning at least three tornadoes and pounding parts of
Indiana with large hail, and wet weather extended over much of the
eastern third of the nation.
   Another storm system spread rain across the Pacific Northwest
with snow in the mountains.
   Thunderstorms broke out in parts of northern Illinois, Indiana
and Michigan and moved into western Ohio during the afternoon.
   A tornado touched down near Waldron, Mich., just north of the
Ohio border, and several barns and other buildings were reported
down, the weather service said. Later, two tornadoes touched down
in Clayton and near Wixom in southeastern Michigan, destroying a
barn and damaging a garage. No injuries were reported.
   Elsewhere in Michigan, one-inch hail fell at Texas Corners in
Kalamazoo County and wind gusted to 59 mph, accompanied by heavy
rain, in Ottawa County.
   The storm knocked out power to about 6,000 Consumers Power Co.
customers Sunday, with Jackson the hardest-hit area. Detroit Edison
Co. also reported scattered outages.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell near Lafayette and Walkerton,
Ind., with hail 1.5 inches in diameter at Rockville, Ind. One-inch
hail was reported at Portage, Ind., 30 miles southeast of downtown
Chicago, accompanied by wind gusting to 40 mph.
   Thunderstorms also extended into western Kentucky and
northwestern Tennessee with heavy rain, gusty wind and hail.
   Outside the thunderstorm area, rain was were scattered from
southern Wisconsin into northern Lower Michigan and from the
eastern Great Lakes into the Tennessee Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued to move along the central
Gulf Coast and became scattered across parts of Georgia and the
Carolinas.
   But the rain abated in southeastern Louisiana, where some New
Orleans suburbs were hit Saturday by tornado damage and flooding
caused by 8 inches of rain in 12 hours. Most streets were dry but
the Red Cross said about 70 evacuees remained in a shelter Sunday.
   Elsewhere, showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered across
the Pacific Northwest. The showers were scattered along coastal
areas of Washington and Oregon into northern California, as well as
across the Idaho Panhandle. Snow showers were reported at higher
elevations of the Cascades.
   On the leading edge of that weather system, strong gusty wind
blew across parts of Montana, reaching 55 mph at Livingston and 48
mph at Cut Bank.
   The temperature at Dickinson, N.D., rose to a record high of 72
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Duluth, Minn., to 91 at Cotulla, Texas. The low for the
day was 17 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, showers and a few thunderstorms were forecast from
the eastern Great Lakes into northern and central New England, with
scattered showers from the northern Great Lakes region through the
upper Ohio Valley and middle Atlantic Coast. Showers and scattered
thunderstorms also were forecast from the central Gulf Coast into
the southern Atlantic region. Scattered showers were forecast from
the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies, with snow showers
in northwestern Montana.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted across northeastern Washington
into northwestern Montana; in the 50s from the northern third of
the Pacific Coast inland to the Rockies, and in the northern Great
Lakes and much of Maine; in the 80s from the desert Southwest to
parts of central Kansas, the southern Plains and lower Mississippi
Valley into Florida; in the low 90s across southwestern Arizona and
much of western Texas; and in the 60s or 70s across most of the
rest of the nation.

   A gunman early Sunday killed four
people and seriously wounded a young woman, but two children found
with them inside a mobile home were unhurt, authorities said.
   A man whose truck fit the description of one seen fleeing the
scene was held for questioning, but he hadn't been booked in
connection with the crimes by late Sunday afternoon, Riverside
County sheriff's investigators said.
   Brett Alexander Hale, 28, was hiding in brush when captured in
Colton, 10 miles from the shooting scene, after passers-by called
authorities to report a man acting suspiciously, sheriff's Lt. Jan
Duke said.
   The killings were believed to be the work of a single gunman,
Ms. Duke said, but she refused to elaborate.
   ``We're not far enough into it to have any motive,'' she said.
   Two children, who appeared to be about 2 and 5 years old, were
found unharmed at the home, Duke said.
   A woman identified as Elizabeth Kimmett, 18, was found seriously
wounded at the home but was expected to live, Ms. Duke said. The
name of the hospital was withheld as a security precaution.
   The bodies of two men and two women were found in the mobile
home, which neighbors said was occupied by a couple in their 20s
and their two young children. Investigators had not identified any
of the four dead people by Sunday afternoon.
   Officers found the bodies about 5:50 a.m. Sunday after a caller,
believed to be Ms. Kimmett, reported an assault in progress, Ms.
Duke said.
   The mobile home sits behind a larger house on a dusty street in
a semirural area 50 miles east of Los Angeles. A sign outside
identified the property as Lorrue Kennels, and neighbors said the
couple groomed and boarded dogs.

   A town marshal who said he'd been
kidnapped by burglars faked his highly publicized disappearance
last week, a Mississippi Highway Patrol investigator said.
   There was an attempted burglary at a local convenience store,
but marshal Gary Stokes _ the town's only full-time policeman _
fabricated the tale of his abduction, state patrol investigator
Larry Rickels said Saturday.
   Rickels said he had not uncovered a motive for the phony
abduction.
   Stokes could not be reached for comment Sunday because his
telephone was busy. His stepmother, Mary Stokes, said she was
surprised by the investigator's finding, but didn't feel residents
would be angry at her stepson because most were just glad he had
returned unharmed.
   Stokes, 35, disappeared about 12:55 a.m. Thursday after calling
for back-up units while investigating an attempted burglary in this
northeastern Mississippi town of 860 residents.
   Police arriving at the store found his car with the engine still
running, the lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the
door. His revolver and billfold were found nearby.
   Stokes reappeared Friday morning after claiming to have escaped
from his captors.
   ``I knew I was done for anyway and I had nothing to lose,''
Stokes said at the time. ``When they let me out of the trunk, I hit
the ground running and I didn't look back.''
   He told reporters that he was ``still nervous and kind of shook
up. They had said several times they were going to kill me, and I
believed them.''
   Rickels, however, said Stokes apparently spent the night in the
woods or an abandoned house in Union County before turning up
Friday.
   In addition, the attempted burglary actually occurred Thursday
afternoon, much earlier than the alleged abduction, Rickels said.
   Stokes' pistol had been fired, but somewhere other than near his
squad car, Rickels said. Stokes claimed the gun went off in a
struggle with his captors.
   Lawmen used tracking dogs in the rain as they searched for
Stokes in rural areas surrounding Blue Mountain on Thursday and
well into the night.
   Rickels said he will discuss his findings with the district
attorney.

<TEXT>
   There was a time when the only boots associated
with this city were cowboy and ski boots, but that changed more
than 30 years ago when police asked an inventor to make a device
that would immobilize a parked car.
   In his small pattern-making shop in west Denver, Frank P. Marugg
designed a 12-pound, jawlike clamp that was first used by the
Denver Police Department in 1955.
   Marugg died 15 years ago, but his Denver Boot continues to
torment parking violators and scofflaws. Many U.S. cities use the
original Denver Boot or a variation, and it also has been used in
Japan, Israel and England.
   Denver city and county officials were enthusiastic about the
boot from the start. Some 200 Denver Boots are used in the metro
area ``and we're ordering more,'' said Sgt. Chuck Espinoza, chief
of the boot detail for the Denver County Sheriff's department.
   The county employs four full-time booters who seek out cars
registered to motorists who haven't paid fines. Once a car is
located, it takes about 19 seconds to fasten one of the 12-pound
boots over the front wheel, said Espinoza.
   The jaw-like clamp covers the hubcap, making it impossible to
remove the tire; trying to drive with the boot can severely damage
a tire. The Denver Boot is made of an aluminum alloy with a
breaking strength of 32,000 pounds per square inch.
   Espinoza said the boots _ which are clamped on cars about 40 or
50 times a day in Denver _ add $1.5 million each year to the city
and county's general fund. Motorist can get ``de-booted'' only by
paying all fines.
   Marugg's daughter Grace Berg, who has taken over the
manufacturing and marketing of her father's most famous invention,
said last week, ``They've been unable to improve on it.''
   Berg, 62, runs the company out of her suburban home. A foundry
pours the metal parts and a mechanic assembles them.
   She recalled how the Denver police asked her father in the early
1950s for a device to eliminate the need to tow.
   ``They were running out of space in the city garages, and it
also relieved the problem of inventorying each car that was towed
in,'' she said.
   Berg said she sells between 50 and 100 boots a year and charges
$275 apiece. Denver gets a special rate, she said, because it buys
so many.
   ``It's not a fast-moving object _ they usually last a long
time,'' said Berg.
   Berg said she also sells many boots to parking garage owners in
New York City, and a few to owners of expensive cars who want to
protect them from thieves.

   Giggling hordes of children raced to find Easter eggs Sunday, a
day that drew millions of Americans to church services, and for
some it was a day to welcome spring with a day in the park or a
strut down the avenue.
   And there were some who devoted the day to helping others, like
80-year-old Virginia Quinn, who went to an early Mass so she could
drive her rounds delivering hot meals to 22 shut-ins for the Meals
on Wheels Program in Lawrenceville, N.J.
   ``The volunteers are the backbone of the organization. That
becomes apparent on holidays,'' said program director Carol Baker.
   Easter egg hunts are getting bigger and bigger.
   Organizers of one program at Wheeler Historic Farm park at Salt
Lake City estimated that twice as many children would show up as
participated last year, so they stocked up on 3,000 bags of candy
and peanuts, and hid about 4,500 colored eggs. However, about 5,000
children lined up for the candy.
   And then there was the egg hunt. ``When we cut them loose and
they ran out there, you couldn't see the hayfield for all the
people,'' said Joe Anderson, an officer in the Union Lions Club.
   In Texas, officials hid more than 10,000 Easter eggs on the
Dallas Arboretum grounds.
   Across the state in Austin, city park officials used bullhorns
to urge the crowd to hold back until the go-ahead signal, but
nearly 2,000 children stampeded in search of Easter eggs, candy and
prizes in Waterloo Park during the 10th Annual Easter
Eggstravaganza.
   In Houston, between 75 and 200 gay rights supporters attended
services at the Second Baptist Church to protest the exclusion of a
French horn player with AIDS and tuberculosis who had been
scheduled to perform at the service.
   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, spent a quiet Easter at
their secluded ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains outside Santa
Barbara. They did not attend church, and there was no gathering of
relatives.
   Elsewhere in California, motorcyclists participated in San
Jose's annual ``blessing of the bikes'' and the Rev. Cecil Williams
of San Francisco's Glide Memorial United Methodist Church
symbolically attacked the burgeoning cocaine trade with a cross,
which he jabbed through a white papier-mache sphere.
   And about 12,000 people awoke before dawn to attend the 68th
traditional Easter Sunrise Service at the Hollywood Bowl.
   New York City's Fifth Avenue was closed to traffic in midtown
Manhattan for the annual Easter Parade of people displaying their
holiday finery and bonnets.
   About 2,000 people braved cloudy weather for Philadelphia's
Easter Promenade, strolling up and down Walnut Street near
fashionable Rittenhouse Square while several bands took turns
serenading the crowd.
   ``I'm having a great time. The kids have been really great,''
said Lynn Folkman, dressed as an Easter Bunny to hand out coconut
cream eggs to children. She said six city employees volunteered to
hit the bunny trail for the day.
   Judges pinned ribbons on anyone wearing appealing outfits or
hats. The people with ribbons were invited to a final judging on
the square.
   At a less festive site, a group of inmates sentenced to life in
New Jersey's Rahway State Prison threw a small party in a room set
aside in the visiting area for other inmates' children, said Joseph
Papciak, an associate member of the group and its executive
secretary.
   ``Five or six members who don't get visitors entertained the
children with Easter eggs and things like that,'' said Papciak, 37,
who has served 14 years of a 25-year sentence for armed robbery.
   Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, primate of the Armenian Church of
America, released a white dove in New York City in honor of St.
Grigoris of Karabagh, who brought Christianity to Armenia. The
archbishop also said a prayer for Armenians in the Soviet Union
trying to reunite their homeland.
   Roman Catholic homosexuals chanting ``Shame! Shame!'' to protest
their exclusion from the church greeted Cardinal John J. O'Connor
when he emerged from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City after
his Easter homily.
   Eighteen people objecting to the cardinal's stance on
homosexuality were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct
when they ignored orders to move from in front of the church.
   After the Mass, O'Connor told reporters that anyone willing to
accord with the church's teachings was welcome. ``Many of the
people who were demonstrating today tell me the church should
change its teachings. The church isn't going to change its
teachings,'' he said.
   In Chicago, homeless demonstrators attended Easter services at a
church whose pastor is chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority's
board.
   ``The things that Christ died for are very much in existence
today,'' said Carolyn Milligan, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-Gary
Area Union for the Homeless, an advocacy group for the area's
estimated 25,000 homeless people.
   The Rev. B. Herbert Martin, chairman of the authority's board
and pastor of the non-denominational Progressive Community Church,
welcomed the homeless to his service. In January, he chained
himself to the front of the local offices of the federal Department
of Housing and Urban Development out of what he said was
frustration with federal unresponsiveness to the needs of
low-income tenants.

<HEAD>Jackson Should Get Nomination If He Gets Most Delegates</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS penultimate graf to DELETE redundant material</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Democrats and voters leaning
toward the party say Jesse Jackson should get the Democratic
nomination if he leads in delegates at the time of the convention,
according to a Newsweek poll released Sunday.
   Sixty-six percent of those polled said that if Jackson had more
delegates and more of the popular vote than the other Democratic
candidates _ but not enough to win the Democratic nomination
outright _ the party's other candidates should rally behind him.
   A total of 20 percent said the other candidates should not rally
behind him, the poll said.
   Seventy-two percent of the respondents said there is no one
other than the current candidates whom they would prefer to see
running for the presidency. Only 8 percent favored New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo getting into the race, and Sens. Bill Bradley and Sam
Nunn had the support of 1 percent each.
   Despite the hefty majority saying Jackson should get the
nomination if he has the most delegates, his negative ratings
remain high, and Gov. Michael Dukakis runs stronger against Vice
President George Bush than he does.
   Jackson got a favorable rating from 53 percent of those polled,
with 38 percent saying they had an unfavorable opinion of him. In a
Newsweek poll conducted in April 1987, 51 percent said their
opinion of Jackson was favorable; 41 percent said they viewed him
unfavorably.
   Thirteen percent of the respondents in Sunday's survey described
their opinion of Jackson as ``very favorable'' and 40 percent said
their view of him was ``mostly favorable.'' Twenty-four percent
said their opinion of him was ``mostly unfavorable,'' with 14
percent saying it was ``very unfavorable.''
   A survey of registered Democratic and Republican voters showed
Bush leading Dukakis 49 percent to 44 percent; Bush was favored
over Jackson 58 percent to 32 percent, according to Newsweek.
   In the poll, Jackson got high marks for honesty, his stand on
social issues and leadership ability.
   Seventy-two percent said they feel he is ``honest and sincere'';
60 percent said he's a ``champion of social justice''; and 56
percent said he ``would be a strong and forceful leader.''
   At the other end of the spectrum, 25 percent said he ``creates
bad feelings between blacks and Jews'' and 34 percent said he ``can
manage the federal government.''
   Fifty-seven percent said that if Jackson were the
vice-presidential nominee, they would be neither more nor less
likely to vote Democratic in the upcoming election.
   The Gallup Organization interviewed 757 registered voters,
including 366 Democrats or leaning Democrats by telephone March 30
and 31.
   The margin of error for questions directed at Democrats and
Democratic leaners was 6 percentage points. For questions directed
at Democrats and Republicans, the margin of error was 4 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Troops Raid Senator's House Looking For Missing Coup Leader</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with raid on Enrile's house, report that
nine other detained soldiers fled, other detail; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops raided the seaside vacation
house of opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile on Sunday but failed to
find the leader of an August coup attempt who fled his prison ship,
the military said.
   A Manila paper, meanwhile, reported that nine other officers
believed to be involved in past coup attempts had fled a detention
center on Saturday. The report could not be confirmed.
   The raid on Enrile's house in Batangas province, southwest of
Manila, was part of as nationwide search for former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt
that nearly toppled the Aquino government, said military officials.
   Honasan, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturday
with 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him.
He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for the
attempted coup that left at least 53 people dead and hundreds
wounded.
   President Corazon Aquino, who had refused to grant amnesty to
Honasan, warned soldiers and civilians not to aid the charismatic
former colonel, who is popular among many in the 160,000-member
armed forces.
   Honasan served as chief of security at the defense ministry when
Enrile was defense chief. Enrile told reporters Sunday he had not
heard from Honasan since the escape.
   ``I'm beginning to sense that they treat me as an enemy,'' said
Enrile, who was fired in November 1986, after an alleged coup
attempt by his followers. ``Why don't they say it openly and
publicly?''
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a nationwide alert
in the wake of Honasan's escape and warned that leftist and
rightist extremists may try to exploit the confusion created by the
former colonel's dramatic flight.
   Trucks blocked all entrances to military garrisons in the
capital, and troops refused to allow reporters and other civilians
to enter the compounds.
   Police set up checkpoints on the outskirts of Manila and placed
homes of Honasan's friends and associates under surveillance. Extra
troops were deployed around the presidential palace.
   De Villa also ordered troops on alert in central and southern
Philippine islands in case disgruntled officers and politicians try
to exploit the volatile situation in Manila and stage attacks
against government installations.
   The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Monday that nine other
soldiers held in connection with coup attempts last August and in
January 1987 had fled the detention center at Manila's Villamor Air
Base early Saturday. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified air force officer as
confirming the escape. The newspaper said the Villamor incident
strengthened speculation that Honasan's escape was part of a broad
conspiracy within the armed forces.
   Manila newspapers also reported leaflets were circulating in
military camps calling for the overthrow of the government. The
leaflets allegedly were from Honasan's Reform the Armed Forces
Movement, the papers said.
   Meanwhile, investigators said Honasan and the others apparently
fled the prison ship aboard rubber dinghies and came ashore near
the Folk Arts Center, a few hundred meters from the headquarters of
the Philippine navy.
   They then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them,
investigators said.
   The Philippine Daily Globe reported Monday that Honasan left
behind a note when he fled the ship saying he was escaping because
``the struggle for a better AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines)
must go on.''
   Honasan played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986,
civilian-military uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos
and brought Mrs. Aquino to power. But he later accused Mrs. Aquino
of weak and inept leadership in the face of the communist
insurgency.

<HEAD>Settlement May Be Near in Lawsuit Involving Kodak Instant Camera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers may be close to a settlement that will
compensate millions of people who bought Kodak instant cameras but
now can't get film, according to a published report.
   The Chicago Tribune, in its Monday editions, said a settlement
in Cook County Circuit Court is expected in the next few weeks.
   ``Serious negotiations are under way,'' William J. Campbell Jr.,
an attorney for Eastman Kodak Co., told the Tribune. He refused to
comment further.
   A class-action lawsuit was brought against Kodak more than two
years ago on behalf of consumers who purchased instant cameras from
1976 through 1985, but who haven't been able to get film for the
last three years because Polaroid Corp. sued Kodak for patent
infringement.
   William Harte, attorney for the plaintiffs, said 16.5 million
people bought the cameras, and about 4 million of those have been
identified.
   The patent infringement suit brought by Polaroid in federal
court in Boston led to a permanent injunction on Sept. 13, 1985,
that barred Kodak from continuing to sell the instant cameras and
film.
   Harte's lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court on Jan. 21, 1986,
accuses Kodak of failing to tell consumers that film might become
unavailable. Polaroid sued Kodak shortly after it began marketing
the instant camera in 1976.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowski had barred Kodak from
negotiating individual settlements with individual plaintiffs.

   About 300 Maoist guerrillas raided a mountain
town, driving the police into hiding, burning several government
buildings and killing a police captive, the Interior Ministry
reported Sunday.
   It said 15 policemen stationed in Panao, 200 miles northeast of
Lima, fled as the rebels attacked at dusk Saturday, but one officer
was captured and shot to death. The ministry communique said it was
believed the other policemen were in hiding in the surrounding
forests and reinforcements had been sent to the area.
   The raid was one of the largest carried out by the Shining Path
guerrillas since they began their insurgency eight years ago.
   According to the communique, the rebels held the town for about
two hours, burning government buildings and then escaping.
   Police in Huancayo, a strategic Andes city 130 miles east of
Lima, told The Associated Press that the guerrillas used explosives
to destroy railroad tracks on the outskirts of Panao, cutting rail
traffic with Lima for 24 hours.

   Margie had a little lamb, little lamb,
little lamb.
   Then another and another.
   Now, Bill and Marge Lange's rare quintuplet lambs are the star
attraction in this small town in southeastern North Dakota.
   ``It was like Grand Central Station,'' Mrs. Lange said. ``The
day after they were born we had 10 people call to see if they were
all right. I've had people bring their kids from town to see the
lambs.''
   ``The ewe was perplexed when she first got up and saw all those
babies,'' she said. ``She looked one way and then the other. It was
unreal.''
   Lamb quints are a rare event, occuring about once in 600,000
deliveries, said Bert Moore, professor of animal and range science
at North Dakota State University.
   The four females and one male, born March 24, are all healthy
and hungry, Mrs. Lange said. The five are being fed by the ewe and
bottle-fed with lamb milk replacement by Mrs. Lange, who said she
feels like a mother again.
   ``I was a nervous wreck the first two days, but I'm fine now,''
she said. ``Saturday night I had to go somewhere, so I called a
babysitter to take care of my lambs. I get up every four hours at
night to feed them. But they're eating more and more hay and oats,
so soon I'll just feed them once a night.''
   Fecundity is in the bloodline. The sire and the ewe were both
triplets, so there's no telling how large a litter the newborn
lambs may eventually have, Mrs. Lange said.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
ended a three-day visit to Morocco Sunday after meetings with King
Hassan II and other officials.
   Carlucci, who then departed on a flight to India, called his
meetings ``very satisfying.''
   ``My talks with his majesty the king did not deal with details
such as the economy or military assistance, but rather on strategic
questions and on the general lines of our bilateral relations,'' he
told a news conference.
   Carlucci said he didn't discuss with Hassan the 1982 agreement
that allows U.S. forces to use Moroccan bases in case of threats to
the interests of both countries. The pact expires in two months.
   ``Our ambassador recently made proposals on this subject,
proposals which concern notably an increase in the number of
maneuvers and military exercises,'' the defense secretary said.
   He added the Moroccan government is still studying the proposals.
   Carlucci is scheduled to visit India and Pakistan, then return
to North Africa for a stop in Tunisia and fly back to Washington on
Saturday.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Sunday denied
a published report that Israel agreed to sell advanced missile
technology to China.
   The Sunday Times of London reported that five Israeli military
specialists secretly went to China in November and struck a deal to
supply China with missile warheads and armor-piercing devices
developed by Israel.
   It said there were indications Israel has been helping China
develop a combat fighter plane using technology derived from
Israel's canceled Lavi jet fighter.
   ``The report that we assist China to develop ground-to-ground
missiles is simply nonsense,'' Rabin told Israel radio. ``There is
no basis to the report as it was published today.''
   Rabin also denied Israel was helping China develop a warplane
with Lavi technology.
   Development of the Lavi, financed mainly by the United States,
was canceled last year after Washington complained about delays and
rising costs.
   Israel and China do not have diplomatic relations.

   Christians worldwide looked beyond global strife on Easter
Sunday, braving unrest in the Holy Land and praying in England for
an end to Northern Ireland's religious bloodshed.
   In his traditional Easter address in Vatican City, Pope John
Paul II told 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square and a broadcast
audience of millions to remember people around the world who suffer
from injustice and war.
   ``Pray for peace in the world, for justice, pray for the rights
of man, especially for religious freedom,'' he said.

   Under police and army guard, pilgrims from
around the world gathered at dawn for Easter Sunday services in the
church marking the site where most Christians believe Jesus rose
from the dead.
   About 1,000 worshipers _ half as many as last year _ attended
services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, church
officials said.
   Many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost daily
violence in the Israeli-occupied territories that have left more
than 130 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. The Greek
Orthodox Church canceled three pre-Easter processions scheduled for

   Federally supported mental health services
have suffered crippling cuts in staff and dollars during the Reagan

   The report, issued by the Government Operations Committee, says
the government is spending billions of dollars a year on mental
health services that often are fragmented, inappropriate,
ineffective or desperately lacking.
   The committee also accused the Office of Management and Budget

division and says the budget-writing agency must not be allowed to

<HEAD>There's Something Fishy About Marilyn Doane's Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Having hooked area markets and restaurants
with her pitch for locally-grown fish, Marilyn Doane has netted the
first profits from the trout-farming business she began three years
ago.
   A venture that started with 1,000 fingerlings now operates on a
bigger scale: 42,000 fish, 17 ponds and some 35 commercial
customers in the Grand Rapids area.
   Doane's Country Lane Fisheries also has begun showing a little
profit for the former carpenter.
   ``It turned around in January; I made $6,'' Doane said.
   Before starting her fishery, the 38-year-old Doane knew little
about the fish-farming business.
   She was a trained secretary, who along with her husband Roger
built and operated a mobile home park while also operating their
own heavy construction equipment. They sold the park in 1981 and
moved to Alaska _ flying in a restored 1947 fabric-covered airplane
_ and on returning bought a 30-acre topsoil farm in Belmont, just
north of Grand Rapids.
   The couple rented out a house to a biologist and an
ichthyologist, who said their farmland was just right for raising
trout, a fish that likes cool water year-round.
   The observations spawned the idea for a trout farm.
   Marilyn Doane took an intensive, two-week course in cold-water
fish hatching at the National Fisheries Academy in Traverse City
and gave up her carpentry job to go into the business.
   She started with 1,000 fingerlings and in a couple of years
built a business that now sells about 3,000 fish a month,
overcoming obstacles such as a 1986 dam break that flooded her
ponds and cost her 6,000 fish.
   The business supplies 35 commercial customers, including 20 D&W
supermarkets in the Grand Rapids area, restaurants, country clubs
and fish stores. Doane is putting in more ponds and building an
addition to her house for more efficient fish processing.
   ``Its potential is almost beyond what I can imagine,'' Doane
said.
   Her biggest sales point is that the fish are locally grown.
   ``The hot button in the food business is locally raised
products,'' said John Astma, D&W's meat manager who promotes the
fish with signs like ``Marilyn's Trout _ grown in Belmont'' at the
chain's fish counters.
   Astma convinced D&W executives to carry Doane's trout in their
stores by bringing the chain's president and vice president of
marketing to the farm for a picnic. It cinched the deal.
   ``You just have to be there to understand what's going on,''
Astma said.

<HEAD>Goodyear Gets OK To Build Tire Plant In Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>

   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. is working with
South Korean officials to select a Korean site for a planned
automated plant that will produce automobile and light truck tires
for Asian markets.
   Goodyear could not estimate the cost of the plant, plans for
which were announced Friday, said company spokesman Hank Ruppel.
   Goodyear now ships U.S.-made tires to auto producers in Japan
and Korea. But Ruppel said the new foreign plant would not affect
U.S. production because the Asian market was expanding.
   Goodyear, the world's largest tire manufacturer, has 88 plants
in 27 nations, including seven in the Pacific Rim. Goodyear's sales
last year were $9.9 billion.
   The planned Korean plant, which should be completed in Spring
1991, will produce more than 3 million steel-belted radial tires
annually.
   ``We need this factory to supply the expanding export
requirement of Goodyear's current business in Asian markets other
than South Korea,'' said Philip Spanninger, Goodyear director of
technology and venture management. ``Our sales to the Japanese auto
industry are growing rapidly.''
   The company will export 75 percent of the tires made at the
South Korean plant to Asian countries, primarily Japan, and 25
percent would be for exported Korean-built cars.
   Ruppel said talks with South Korean officials began about three
years ago and the company applied last fall for permission to build
the plant.
   He said the Korean plant would be smaller than any of the
company's U.S. facilities and its technology would be on par with
that of some U.S. plants.

   Campeau will acquire Federated for $73.50 a share, or a total of
$6.58 billion, Campeau and Federated said in a statement Friday.
   Macy came away from the fight with the I. Magnin chain and the

   The economy continued to grow in March on the
strength of exporters, although at a slower pace than the previous
month, the nation's purchasing managers said in a survey.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Sunday
that its economic growth index fell to 53.3 percent last month from
54.9 percent in February, the lowest since a reading of 54.7
percent in April 1987.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy generally is
expanding. March was the 20th consecutive month above the

   WASHINGTON _ (AP) _ The nation's unemployment rate fell to a new
decade-low 5.6 percent in March even though there were 306,000
fewer Americans at work than a month earlier, the government said.
   The drop from February's 5.7 percent rate was credited entirely
to a 455,000 decrease in the number of people in the labor force _
those either holding jobs or seeking work _ raising inflationary
alarms among some economists.
   ``It indicates that wages are not high enough to coax second
earners out of the home any more,'' Roger Brinner, an analyst for
Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm in Lexington,
Mass, said Friday.

<HEAD>Economic Growth Continued In March, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>

   The economy continued growing in March on the
strength of export activity, although at a slower pace than in the
previous month, according to a survey by the nation's purchasing
managers.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Sunday
that its economic growth index fell to 53.3 percent last month from
54.9 percent in February, the lowest since a reading of 54.7
percent in April 1987.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy generally is
expanding; a reading below that indicates it generally is
declining. March was the 20th consecutive month above the
break-even mark.
   ``The economy completed the first quarter with moderate, if not
substantial, growth,'' Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's
business survey committee, said in a statement.
   ``The healthy increase in new orders, particularly export
orders, along with the anticipated slowing of price increases,
signals continued improvement in the economy in the second
quarter.''
   March represented the 15th consecutive month of growth in new
orders, according to the survey. Thirty-two percent of the
purchasing mangers polled reported higher levels of new orders,
compared with 31 percent in February and 35 percent in January.
   Of those whose companies export, 41 percent said their export
orders were higher in March, while 3 percent said they were lower.
That was up from 33 percent in February and 39 percent in January.
   The monthly report is based on a survey of more than 250
industrial purchasing managers who belong to the national
organization.
   Among other findings of the survey:
   _Production growth slowed from February, although it was at a
level still considered very healthy. Members who reported stronger
production outweighed those reporting weaker, 32 percent to 8
percent.
   _Deliveries from vendors slowed for the 18th consecutive month,
a reflection of the slowdown in deliveries. Twenty-three percent
said they had slower deliveries, compared with 5 percent reporting
faster.
   _Inventories declined sharply after growing modestly in the past
two months. Twenty-three percent said they had lower inventories,
vs. 10 percent who had higher.
   _Fifty-five percent reported higher prices, compared with 64
percent in February, indicating a decline in inflation. Three
percent reported lower prices, up from 1 percent in February.
   _Employment grew for an eighth straight month, although the
results could be viewed as a slight decline considering normal
seasonal increases expected in March.
   _Prices rose for a wide variety of raw materials and fell for
only a few, including fuel oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and
chlorine.
   _Products in short supply included aluminum, steel and other
metals and a variety of chemicals.

<HEAD>Campeau Gains Mall Presence, Loses Diversity In Deal That Won
Federated</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is for Monday PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. gained a major new presence in
U.S. shopping malls by winning an agreement to acquire Federated
Department Stores Inc., but will lose some of Federated's diversity
in the process.
   To help finance its $73.50 a share, $6.58 billion buyout of
Federated, Toronto-based Campeau said it would sell several other
Federated chains and one of its own holdings.
   But Campeau initially will keep Federated's ``crown jewel''
retailers _ Bloomingdale's, Rich's, Lazarus, Goldsmith's, Burdines,
and Abraham & Straus _ that are seen as giving it a key foothold in
U.S. malls.
   The combined Federated-Campeau will be the nation's
fourth-largest retailer with annual sales of about $15 billion,
trailing only Sears, Roebuck & Co., K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.
   Analysts say a key Campeau goal in the bitter, two-month battle
against R.H. Macy & Co. for control of Cincinnati-based Federated,
which ended with Friday's merger agreement, was to acquire real
estate, especially in major malls.
   Stores such as the Federated crown jewels are regarded as
``anchors,'' the one or two major stores generally placed in a mall
to attract shoppers.
   Such heavyweights as Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, in addition to
its present Jordan Marsh operations, give Campeau instant entree to
some malls while increasing its negotiating strength with
developers of new malls.
   ``If you are an anchor tenant, you may get 10 to 20 per cent of
a (shopping) center for free,'' said one industry analyst with a
Canadian firm, who asked not to be identified. ``If you were in a
position to commit two or three choice anchors _ as Campeau would
be able to do _ you might get 30 to 40 per cent.''
   The analyst noted Robert Campeau, chairman of Campeau Corp.,
built the company as a real estate and mall developer, and
speculated Campeau now could ``make a shopping center just by
agreeing to locate the anchors.''
   To acquire such benefits, Campeau agreed to sell to Macy the I.
Magnin I. Magnin, Bullock's and Bullock's-Wilshire operations of
Federated for $1.1 billion.
   Campeau had agreed earlier in the takeover fight to sell its
Brooks Brothers clothing chain _ which it acquired in its 1986
takeover of Allied Stores Corp. _ to Britain's Marks & Spencer PLC
for $720 million.
   Campeau also had agreed to sell Federated's Texas-based Foley's
and Boston-based Filene's department stores to May Department
Stores Co.
   Furthermore, Campeau has said already it would sell Federated's
Filene's Basement stores in response to antitrust concerns among
several Northeastern states, has plans to sell Federated's
supermarket and specialty store chains and widely is expected to
sell other department store chains.
   The pattern mirrors the path Campeau took after acquiring Allied
for $3.6 billion, when he sold most of the company's store
operations to help pay off the debt incurred to make the deal.
   Although the divestments stemming from the Federated deal will
enable Campeau to make the transaction, some analysts say the sales
will eliminate some of the variety that made Federated such an
attractive company at the outset.
   ``Campeau's victory is a great one, but he's giving up a lot for
it,'' said Walter F. Loeb, a retail industry analyst with the
investment firm Morgan Stanley & Co.
   ``He's going to end up with just the core department stores and
end Federated's long tradition of diversity,'' Loeb said.
   Loeb and other analysts have said that by eliminating that
diversity the Campeau-Federated coupling continued the recent trend
toward ``sameness'' among the nation's big retailers.
   Some industry watchers believe that under Campeau, Federated
will consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that
are now carried out separately by the Federated units.
   That could dampen innovation created by having more retailers
buying and experimenting with new merchandise, which fosters new
styles and trends.
